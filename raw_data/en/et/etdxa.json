The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 2 p.m., in room 2226, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Robert W. Kastenmeier (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding. Present: Representatives Kastenmeier, DeWine, Moorhead, and Sawyer. Staff present: Michael J. Remington, chief counsel; Joseph V. Wolfe, associate counsel; and Audrey K. Marcus, clerical staff. Mr. KASTENMEIER. The committee will come to order. Today the committee is meeting to consider the bill, H.R. 3403, which would establish a State Justice Institute. As envisioned, the Institute would provide valuable assistance to the States in the ad\u00ad ministration of their judicial systems. The Institute would fill a large void in the way of resources and information services availa\u00ad ble to State courts systems which presently process more than 95 percent of the Nation's judicial caseload. There was first introduced in the 96th Congress similar legisla\u00ad tion which was subject to a hearing by this subcommittee and, un\u00ad fortunately, even though it was processed by the Senate, we were not able to get favorable final action by the House before the con\u00ad clusion of the Congress. Now in this Congress, it is my hope that we will see this Insti\u00ad tute become a reality. I am confident that the quality and efficien\u00ad cy of many of our State judicial systems would be greatly enhanced by the enactment of the legislative ideas at least embodied in this measure. Without objection, a copy of the bill will be inserted in the [The bill, H.R. 3403, follows:] (l) 2 s*-iiio?/-/ 98TH CONGRESS 1ST SESSION H.

The provisions of this Act shall take effect on 12 October 1, 1983. Mr. KASTENMEIER. I might add that I am gratified that 10 mem\u00ad bers of the subcommittee have cosponsored the bill, and 17 mem\u00ad bers, including the chairman and ranking minority member, of the full committee have become cosponsors. Thus, there is strong sup\u00ad port indicated in the Judiciary Committee for the creation of the State Justice Institute. Before introducing this afternoon's witnesses, I would also like to say that we will have only 1 day of hearings. Written statements will be received from the Judicial Conference of the United States and from the Department of Justice. In addition, the record will remain open to individuals and organizations wishing to comment on the proposed legislation. Indeed, one of our colleagues from Oregon, the Honorable Les AuCoin, has submitted a very brief statement which he asks us to include in the record. Without objection, his statement will be received and made part of the record. [The statement of Mr. AuCoin follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT BY THE HONORABLE LES AUCOIN BEFORE THE HOUSE SUBCOM\u00ad MITTEE ON COURTS, CIVIL LIBERTIES, AND THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, JULY 13, 1983 Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to testify in support of H.R. 3404, the State Justice Institute Act of 1983, and I want to commend you for your leadership in focusing attention on the critical, largely unattended problems of our overbur\u00ad dened state courts. 28 If the robed and blindfolded figure that symbolizes justice to America could speak, she would warn them to think twice before taking a grievance to court, because jus\u00ad tice will not be swift and it will be more costly than they even imagined. I am pleased today, on behalf of the Honorable Berkley Lent, Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court, to urge the swift adoption of this bill so that we can begin to provide vital technical and financial assistance to help speed the delivery of jus\u00ad tice in our state courts and assist in the nationwide fight against crime. Help is especially needed in Oregon, Mr. Chairman. Oregon's state courts experi\u00ad ence a 78 percent increase in the number of cases filed between 1977 and 1981\u2014the third highest rate of increase in the nation. Today, Oregon's 10-member Court of Appeals holds the distressing distinction of having the highest caseload of any court of its size in the nation, with 3,403 cases filed in 1981. While the judicial and administrative workload of Oregon's courts has increased dramatically, state and local support has lagged. As you know, Mr. Chairman, historically the courts have been without a constitutency to speak for them in state legislatures. The courts lose ground when times are bad. In Oregon, times have been very bad indeed. To cite just one example, the Office of the State Court Administrator in Oregon, which is responsible for the administrative management of the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals and Tax Court, was forced to lay off 20 people because of a budget cut three years ago. All of those positions have yet to be made up, hampering every\u00ad thing from routine accounting and record keeping to the processing of appeals. Judges and administrators have told me that the court system in Oregon is disin\u00ad tegrating because of the case overload and lack of resources. At the same time, aver\u00ad age-income Oregonians and small business owners whose taxes support the court system can't afford to use it because the expense of litigation has become prohibi\u00ad tive. As the Chief Justice of the United States has noted, the declining quality and in\u00ad creasing cost of justice in our state courts is a problem of national concern, because \"the state courts are close to the people and they are the primary safeguard of the rights and privileges of individuals under both federal and state law.\" In closing, Mr. Chairman, I want to associate myself with your remarks in the House of Representatives, June 23, on the introduction of this bill. It urgently needs to be enacted. Mr. KASTENMEIER. NOW, I would like to call on our first panel of witnesses representing the Conference of State Chief Justices. The Honorable Robert F. Utter, former chief justice and now justice of the Supreme Court of the State of Washington, is chairman of the Chief Justices' Committee on the State Justice Institute Act. The Honorable Harry L. Carrico is chief justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia. Gentlemen, you are most welcome and I invite you to proceed as you wish. TESTIMONY OF HON. ROBERT F. UTTER, JUSTICE, SUPREME COURT OF WASHINGTON; AND HON. HARRY L. CARRICO, CHIEF JUSTICE, SUPREME COURT OF VIRGINIA, CONFERENCE OF CHIEF JUSTICES Judge UTTER. Mr. Chairman, it is really with a feeling of great privilege that I appear on behalf of the Conference of Chief Jus\u00ad tices representing the 50 farflung States of this Union to discuss a subject that you have identified this morning as one of national im\u00ad portance dealing inextricably with the role of law in these 50 States and our Federal Government. I am, as you have indicated, Justice Robert Utter of the State of Washington. It has been my distinct privilege and pleasure to have appeared before this subcommittee in both the 96th and 97th Con\u00ad gresses to assist in testimony on this bill. We deeply appreciate the leadership that you have shown on behalf of this measure and the patience. We appreciate the biparti-29 san support that is also present for this bill. We express our appre\u00ad ciation to Chairman Rodino, to Mr. Fish, and to Mr. Moorhead for their support, as well as for the generous support of both parties. We feel, as I am sure you have realized, that a deliberate pace is necessary in judicial matters, and we have seen the understanding of the concepts behind this bill improved by a large number of the Members of Congress. A better bill has been produced as a result of the time spent on this matter. Without seeking to equate the State Justice Institute with the in- tercircuit tribunal, a matter that you were discussing and have before you now, I think there are important parallels to both bills. First, both bills were developed out of a special task force or com\u00ad missioned studies seeking solutions to long and complex problems. Second, both involve short-term authorizations and they certain\u00ad ly are frankly experimental in their approach. This bill that you have now before you has really nothing to compare it with, and we appreciate the willingness and opportunity to explore that subject with you. We feel that the basic premise is that improvement of the qual\u00ad ity of justice in the States is of equal importance to the Federal Government as well as to the States. The failure of the State judici\u00ad ary at any level cannot be separated from concerns with justice at the Federal level. Because we have been before this committee on previous times, I will not offer a full review of the legislation that you have before you, but I think it is of interest to look at current matters that are pending before this Congress and see how they impact on the States. Also, how this bill might be a part of the solution, rather than the problem. One matter that has concerned us greatly is the proposed Prod\u00ad uct Liability Act, which was approved by the Senate Commerce Committee late in the 97th Congress, and again is before that com\u00ad mittee as Senate bill 44. That bill would substitute a Federal stat\u00ad ute for tort laws of the States in the rapidly growing field of prod\u00ad uct liability. While the proposal would leave the trial or product liability cases in the State courts and not create new Federal question juris\u00ad diction, it represents a major intrusion into State legal and judicial affairs with consequences that are unknown for a number of years. It seems ironic to me that while an intercircuit tribunal is at least being discussed to resolve some of the Federal problems that have arisen in State jurisprudence the impact of 50 different States con\u00ad struing the Federal issues involved in this Federal Products Liabili\u00ad ty Act and the consequent impact of those appeals on the Federal system has not been addressed. A second area that is of great concern to us is the Armed Career Criminal Act. In another action, Congress approved the Armed Career Criminal Act which would permit Federal jurisdiction of the trial of an armed felon facing a third State charge of robbery or burglary. Except for the President's pocket veto of the omnibus crime bill which included it, that legislation would now be law. We understand it has been approved by the Senate Judiciary Commit\u00ad tee as Senate bill 52. 25-622 O - 84 - 3 30 Neither bill is wrong, we believe, in the concerns that they ad\u00ad dress, but they are symptomatic of the problem faced by State courts. The States courts were not consulted prior to the presenta\u00ad tion of these bills and the impact of these bills and the way that the problems are addressed in the bills demonstrate, I think, the great need for State courts to be a part of the general concern ex\u00ad pressed by the Federal Government in these areas. They both seek Federal solutions to complex civil and criminal issues in the State. They were addressed in a piecemeal matter which extends Federal power and they have the potential for great\u00ad ly increasing, I believe, the caseload in the Federal courts. Proponents of the Property Liability Act argue that Federal pre\u00ad emption is necessary because the States have failed to use uniform laws. The same logic might well be applied in other fields. For in\u00ad stance, the American bar recently adopted a policy position oppos\u00ad ing the Federal product liability law but at the same time called for Federal legislation on claims for damages arising from occupa\u00ad tional diseases with long periods of latency, such as asbestosis. You are aware, I am certain, of the large number of asbestos cases which are creating serious problems for the courts in many States, and even the Federal system. But again, what are the side effects of this legislation? Is a Federal law the most effective remedy? The National Center for State Courts has launched an imagina\u00ad tive and promising effort, albeit with very limited resources, to deal with the problem at the State level. The initial analysis indi\u00ad cates that the volume of asbestos cases, while serious is not the major problem. The real problem, it appears, is that very few of these cases are settled and they are not settled because there is no claims process for them. The State courts, as a result, have been those forums of first resort, rather than last resort. Instead of having a rational settle\u00ad ment process where a trial is only the last resort, the trial is the first inquiry with no interim way to solve the problem. This is not the role the State courts are accustomed to playing and it is not a role they play well. One possible solution suggested by the study done by the national center looks to cooperative agreements among insurance carriers and manufacturers which would permit most claims to be filed with and settled by a central claims agency, either privately or in conjunction with the courts. It is that type of approach, while unique, I think a State justice institute, once in place, can have a part in bringing about. Having this agency there as a body of first resort, to discuss with this Con\u00ad gress and its Members interested in judicial problems, ways to solve the problems, I believe would be of great benefit. One of the areas that Congress is now involved in as well is a bit of new legislation authorizing Federal assistance to State and local criminal justice agencies. On this point, we only note that many of the problems that we experienced with the Law Enforcement As\u00ad sistance Administration in the 1970's, which initiated the chain of events leading to this legislation, are still with us. We have in mind the separation-of-powers and civil-criminal jus\u00ad tice issues disclosed in our statement and do not wish to belabor them beyond noting that the administration's bill reported by the 31 Senate Judiciary Committee as Senate bill 53 is particularly trou\u00ad bling in that it originally contained no authority for funding any judicial branch programs, even if such programs were those most urgently needed by State and local governments receiving formula funds under the act. Nor has the Department of Justice been will\u00ad ing to accept meaningful Senate amendments in this regard. If the State Justice Institute Act is passed and funded at any\u00ad where near the authorization levels of H.R. 3403, those problems will lose some of their significance, but it is important to remember that the State Justice Institute would administer only a national discretionary program and would have no formula funds. Thus, if the State Justice Institute Act is not passed, or is funded inadequately, State and local courts would again be without Feder\u00ad al assistance of the type going to executive branch functions of the criminal justice system. We have reviewed the legislation proposed by this House and have a desire to work with this subcommittee on any meaningful amendments that you may wish to offer. There are changes, I think, that are apparent that may need to be made. Presidential flexibility in appointing members of the board, removal of board members for cause or for illness, authorization periods changing probably from 1984, 1986 to 1985, 1987, and lastly, an amendment clarifying approval of projects by the State's highest court, which must be consistent with State law. The Conference of Chief Justices has supported various proposals which would curtail the growth of Federal caseloads. One of the matters that has been of most pride to me in working on this project has been to see an expression of sentiment on the part of the States that we can do it. Federal diversity jurisdiction was one of the original issues that challenged the State courts and as long as 6 years ago, Chief Jus\u00ad tice Sheran, the then chief justice of the supreme court of Minneso\u00ad ta, challenged the Conference of Chief Justices to accept their burden in cases that were now clogging the Federal system. To my great pride, I must confess, astonishment, the Conference of Chief Justices at that time voted 50 to 0 to urge the Federal Gov\u00ad ernment to bring cases, then in Federal courts, relating to diversity of jurisdiction, into the State courts, in spite of the enormous burden that would be imposed. Of course, major metropolitan States, such as New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Michigan, Florida, and California all have special problems that would be created if diversity jurisdiction in Federal courts were abolished. But the interesting thing to me is that the courts of the States, rather than taking the attitude, \"Let the Federal Government do it,\" have expressed a willingness to ex\u00ad plore this issue and finding meaningful ways in which State courts could assume that burden. Limitation on Federal habeas corpus jurisdiction is another area where State courts can be of great assistance to the Federal Gov\u00ad ernment. Mr. Chairman, and members of this committee, if you combine diversity jurisdiction cases and habeas corpus cases, you are speaking of 36 percent of the total caseload burden before the Federal courts. The State courts have expressed a willingness to 32 take this burden from the Federal courts. Meaningful ways can be found to handle that within their own jurisdictional burdens. That is no small offer. To me, it is a strong example of the will\u00ad ingness of State courts to make federalism something meaningful and to help the Federal courts. Minnesota, in a limited experiment in working with the Federal courts in that State, was able to reduce by almost 90 percent the number of Federal habeas corpus cases that came to the Federal court jurisdiction in that State through a span of years. One of the things we are trying to do with the State Justice In\u00ad stitute is to be able to find a way to replicate experiments of that nature that will have an impact in a meaningful way on the case\u00ad loads facing Federal courts. What State courts want most is, first of all, to be better than we are. We recognize our own failings. We recognize that there are many areas where we need to improve. We also want the public, lawyers as well, to recognize that we are better than they think we are. I think that is part of the problem of the inextricably inter\u00ad twined difficulties relating to Federal and State jurisdiction. It is the perception, and I urge an unfair one, of counsel who are concerned about diversity issues, that they cannot get as fair a hearing in State courts as they can in Federal courts, that some\u00ad how the quality of justice offered is less. Until that perception is addressed, and addressed in a way that can assure the quality of justice is the same, the Federal court system is going to unavoidably be faced with a portion of the burden that State courts should be able to help them with. What we need in the State Justice Institute, and what act pro\u00ad vides, is an agency that will be met with a sophisticated approach to the interrelated problems of the State and Federal jurisdiction. Ninety-eight percent of the cases heard in this country, in the court systems of this country, are heard in State courts. We share with the Federal courts in 98 percent of those cases, however, the responsibility for rights of all citizens that are guaranteed in the Federal Constitution. I have a concern in addressing to members of this committee a desire to point out what the State Justice Institute is not, because we have worked carefully for so many years to try and focus nar\u00ad rowly on what we would hope to accomplish. The first thing it is not is a Federal program imposed on State courts by the Federal GovernmentTT~served as a trial judge, as a juvenile court judge, as a court of appeals judge, and finally as chief justice in trying to resolve problems created by the imposition of Federal programs on State courts. I react adversely to those. The State Justice Institute is not a financial assistance program for basic responsibilities for State courts. If those basic responsibil\u00ad ities are funded by the Federal Government, the States will never assume the proper burden for basic justice provided within their boundaries. It is not a major burden, I submit, on the taxpayers of this Feder\u00ad al Government. It is a modest program in line with many of those now in the criminal justice field, the National Institute for Correc\u00ad tions, and others, which address different but important parts of the criminal justice area. 33 I think, lastly, it does not create a large new bureaucracy. It deals with and benefits from those agencies in place in the various States and because it is not a program imposed on them, it would have their full cooperation, both with their staffs and their ideas in trying to make this program work. What we hope the Institute will be is, first of all, a federally chartered, nonprofit corporation whose policy will be set by a board appointed by the President. Grants would be given on project bases only. Priorities would set by the courts, those who actually are af\u00ad fected by the programs, and there would be support as well for na\u00ad tional organizations serving the courts, such as the National Col\u00ad lege for the Judiciary and the Institute for Court Management as well. Emphasis would be on research, education, demonstration, clearinghouse, and technical assistance programs that are national in scope. The principal features of the Institute would be control of State officials with firsthand knowledge of the problems they are dealing with, responsive directly to the Judiciary Committees of this Con\u00ad gress. Responsibility would be placed on judicial officials charged with that responsibility in the States. We would hope by this to speed court improvements and promote economics of scale nation\u00ad ally. We lastly, and I think far from least, would hope to have an agency capable of speaking and acting on behalf of the States. The perceived inadequacies of State courts have been responsible for many of the burdens on the Federal courts. We would hope by forthrightly and adequately addressing these perceived inadequa\u00ad cies to release some of the burdens that now exist on Federal courts. The problems facing the State court systems are varied and long standing. In some cases, they are structural; in some cases, they are managerial; in some cases, they are problems not only of per\u00ad ception, but of reality as well. The thing that has consistently im\u00ad pressed me in dealing with the judges of the various States has been their willingness to become better, their wish to become better than they are and their desire to be recognized for the qual\u00ad ity that they do have. In conclusion, I would like to say that the State Justice Institute has been proposed by State judicial leaders as the mechanism by which they can focus attention on many common issues facing them and deal with these issues in the most appropriate and effi\u00ad cient manner. Our experience with LEAA funding, however brief, taught us how much we could accomplish with even limited amounts of dis\u00ad cretionary money, the kind of money we simply have not been able to obtain from State legislatures afflicted with what Maurice Rosenberg has termed the disease of \"erratic thriftiness,\" but whose attention is understandably directed to matters of State con\u00ad cern, not national-level concerns. The Conference of Chief Justices believes, then, the State Justice Institute is essential if State courts are to handle appropriately within the State context without Federal intervention growing na\u00ad tional problems such as those associated with fields of product lia-34 bility, asbestos litigation; that they are to assume, as they should, the burden of Federal diversity cases which constituted nearly 25 percent of the Federal civil filings in 1982. We would hope to reduce the need for Federal habeas corpus and civil rights actions by State prisoners which constituted 12 percent of Federal civil filings in 1982; to eliminate the need for Federal prosecution and trial of State career criminals and the expansion of Federal jurisdiction and caseloads that that entails; and I think to have more importantly an effective voice in the formulation of policies and programs for administration of justice to initiate here in Washington to marshal the resources needed to implement those programs and policies. We believe this act is essential, in short, if State courts are to adequately fulfill their role in our Federal system and Federal courts are to remain courts of limited jurisdiction with their spe\u00ad cial place in our constitutional scheme. We thank you, again, for this opportunity to present our views. Chief Justice Carrico is prepared to expand on these introductory remarks, if you wish. We will be pleased to respond to any ques\u00ad tions you have. [The statement of Judge Utter follows:] 35 STATEMENT OF THE CONFERENCE OF CHIEF JUSTICES ON H.R. 3*03, THE STATE JUSTICE INSTITUTE ACT BEFORE THE HOUSE JUDICIARY SUBCOMMITTEE ON COURTS, CIVIL LIBERTIES, AND THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE July 13, 1983 36 Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: The Conference of Chief Justices again is pleased to present its views on the State Justice Institute Act, legislation which we believe is essential to an appropriate relationship between the judicial branches of the 50 states and the national government here in Washington. We also believe it essential to the effective continuation of the rule of law as we have known it over the nearly 200 years of our federal history. I am Robert F. Utter, Justice of the Supreme Court of the State of Washington and chairman of the conference of Chief Justices' Committee on the State Justice Institute Act. My colleague is the Honorable Harry L. Carrico, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia and a member of the Conference's Committee on State-Federal Rela\u00ad tions. I had the pleasure of appearing before this Subcommittee when it considered and approved the State Justice Institute Act in the 96th and 97th Congresses and am delighted to be here today with Chief Justice Carrico to renew our support and bring the issues up-to-date. However, Mr. Chairman, we first must express to you the Conference's deep appreciation for the leadership you and the Subcommittee have shown in bringing this legislation to the attention of the House. We also are indebted to Peter Rodino as chair\u00ad man of the full committee, to Hamilton Fish, the ranking minority member, to Carlos Moorhead, ranking minority on the Subcommittee, and to all the others on the long list of cosponsors who joined you in introducing the bill. We are, in truth, overwhelmed by this impressive show of support and are particu\u00ad larly pleased that it comes from distinguished members on both sides of the aisle. We trust this is a harbinger of equally good news at subsequent stages of the legislative process. As I have indicated, Mr. Chairman, this is our third appearance before the Sub\u00ad committee on this legislation and I am, indeed, delighted to return for most of us in 37 -2- the judiciary know, as Chief Justice Carrico can attest from recent efforts to establish an intermediate court of appeals in Virginia, that basic judicial reforms, or even modest programs for court improvement, should not be underaken by the impatient or the short- winded. We trust we are neither. But we have gained over the past three or four years a deeper insight into what must be the feelings of Chief Justice Burger when he laments the sometimes glacial pace of the Congress in its consideration of reforms deemed urgent by the federal judiciary. There is great value, of course, to a deliberate pace in such matters and this is well illustrated by the history of the current proposal for an Intercircuit Tribunal of the United States Court of Appeals. The conference of Chief Justices has not taken a position on this bill but you have been wise, it seems to me, in not acting hastily on the various proposals to expand the capacity of the federal appellate system to resolve issues of national law. The limited, and admittedly experimental approach of the present bill makes sense, and will in time provide the right solution to what most agree are problems of great complexity at the apex of our judicial system. Without seeking to equate the State Justice Institute with the Intercircuit Tribunal in any substantive way, we can cite important parallels in that (1) both bills were develop\u00ad ed out of special task force or commission studies seeking solutions to complex, long- term problems; (2) both involve short-term authorizations; and (3) both are frankly experi\u00ad mental in their approach. It follows that neither involves a permanent or unalterable Congressional commitment should they not prove effective in addressing the problems they were designed to solve. The Conference of Chief Justices always has looked upon the State Justice Institute Act as a first step in structuring an appropriate and mutually beneficial relationship between state court systems and the federal government. In our initial testimony before this subcommittee we said: \"We do not profess to have arrived at a perfect solution but we do feel we have structured an agency by which to begin what would be the first 38 federal program for state courts in which the Congress looked directly at, and attempted to resolve, the complex issues involved.\" We described the legislation as \"a landmark of major significance in the history of our justice system\", and said it \"would create a unique national resource to meet a unique national need.\" We have always known that what we were proposing was unprecedented and there\u00ad fore subject to change as we gained experience. That still is our position. We have repeatedly testified, then, that the State Justice Institute legislation is premised on the belief that improvement in the quality of justice administered by the states is not only a goal of fundamental importance in itself, but is essential to attain\u00ad ment of important national objectives including a reduced rate of growth in the caseload of the federal courts and preservation of the historic role of state judiciaries in our federal system. We believe, in short, that the futures of state and federal judiciaries are inextricable. That is why we have come to you with the State Justice Institute Act. Because the Subcommittee previously has reviewed this legislation in detail, Mr. Chairman, we do not propose a full statement of its hisotry at this time. Rather, we would like to concentrate on recent developments in the Congress which we believe reinforce our past positions and point more directly than ever to the need for a State Justice Institute. There have been three bills of particular interest, all of them with good pros\u00ad pects of becoming law. The first is the proposed Product Liability Act which was approv\u00ad ed by the Senate Commerce Committee late in the 97th Congress and again is before that committee as S. *<t. This bill would substitute a federal statute for the tort laws of the states in the rapidly growing field of product liability. While the proposal would leave the trial of product liability cases in the state courts, and not create new federal question jurisdiction, it represents a major federal intrusion into state legal and judicial affairs with unknown consequences of vast potential for the federal system. 39 -4- In another action, congress approved the Armed Career Criminal Act which would permit federal prosecution and trial of an armed felon facing a third state charge of robbery or burglary. Except for the President's pocket veto of the omnibus crime bill which included it, this legislation would now be law. We understand it has again been approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee as S. 52. Both of these bills, by seeking federal solutions to complex civil and criminal issues in the state courts, might well cause more problems than they could solve. They would seem to raise many questions which have not been thoroughly examined and repre\u00ad sent piecemeal, hit-and-miss approaches to broader problems of state-federal jurisdiction that we should be considering. In the meantime, either directly or indirectly, they would extend federal power into areas traditionally reserved to the states and needlessly, per\u00ad haps, increase the caseloads of the federal courts, including the United States Supreme Court whose justices are telling us with increasing urgency that they are unable to carry their present load. We cannot help but note that the Supreme Court already is in need of assistance in resolving conflicts between the circuits of the relatively small federal system. At least that is the principal reason for the proposed Intercircuit Tribunal, as we understand it. What, then, would be the effect on the Supreme Court's caseload if 50 state supreme courts are required to interpret a federal statute preempting only a limited but very intricate portion of the tort law of their states? With such a precedent would any area of state tort law be secure from federal preemption? 40 Proponents of the Product Liability Act argue that federal preemption is necessary because the states have failed to use their own uniform law procedures. The same logic might well be applied to other fields. For instance, the American Bar Association recently adopted a policy position opposing the federal product liabilty law but at the same time called for federal legislation on claims for damages arising from occupational diseases with long periods of latency such as asbestosis. You are aware, I am certain, of the large number of asbestos cases which are creating serious problems for the courts of many states and even the federal system. But again, what would be the side effects of such legislation? Is a federal law the most effective remedy? The National Center for State Courts has launched an imaginative and promising effort, albeit with very limited resources, to deal with this problem at the state level. The initial analysis indicates that the volume of asbestos cases, while serious enough, is not the basic problem. The real problem, it now appears, is that very few of these cases are settled. This is because there is no claims process for them and, therefore, no one to settle with. Each claim tends to result in many cross-claims with the result that there are too many parties and too many lawyers involved. State courts, which should be the forums of last resort in such matters, become the forums of first instance. This is not a role they are practiced in playing and they do not play it well. One possible solution looks to cooperative agreements among insurance carriers and manufacturers which would permit most claims to be filed with, and settled by, a central claims agency, either privately or in conjunction with the courts. The National Center looks to this effort as a basis for action on similar problems in the future. There is reason to hope, then, that many of the more difficult problems facing our justice system, both civil and criminal, can be resolved within a state context, without direct federal intervention and the unknowns that implies for our dual court system. What we need are the resources to deal with these problems at the state level and the State Justice Institute has been designed to provide them. 41 -6- The third area of recent Congressional action that bears on the State Justice Institute legislation involves new bills authorizing federal assistance to state and local criminal justice agencies. On this point we will only note that many of the problems we experienced with the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration in the 1970s, and which initiated the chain of events leading to the legislation we are considering today, are still with us. We have in mind the separation-of-powers and civil-criminal issues discussed below and do not wish to belabor them in this context beyond noting, that the administration's bill, reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee as S. 53, is particularly troubling in that it originally contained no authority for funding any judicial branch programs, even if such programs were those most urgently needed by state and local governments receiving formula funds under the act. Nor has the Department of Justice been willing to accept meaningful Senate amendments in this regard. If the State Justice Institute Act is passed, and funded at anywhere near the authorization levels in H.R. 3*03, these problems will lose much of their significance. But it is important to remember that the State Justice Institute would administer only a national discretionary program and would have no formula funds. Thus, if the State Justice Institute Act is not passed, or is funded inadequately, state and local courts would again be without federal assistance of the type going to executive branch functions of the criminal justice system. The remainder of our statement, Mr. Chairman, necessarily covers much the same ground as the statement provided to the Subcommittee last September when you last acted on the State Justice Institute Act. It provides a brief history and summary of the legislation which may be appropriate for the hearing record if not for presentation at this time. We will close this portion of our remarks by stating our desire to work with the Subcommittee in making any technical or substantive amendments that are appropriate in light of changed circumstances. We are pleased that the bill as introduced includes an 42 -7- amendment to Sec. f (a) (3) which gives the President greater flexibility in appointing members of the Board of Directors and trust this meets the concerns expressed by the Department of Justice over the limitations placed on the President by previous language. In this regard, we also should note the need for an additional amendment that would authorize removals of board members for cause and provide for appointments to fill vacancies as these develop through expiration of terms, death, resignation, or otherwise. We would be happy to suggest such language if that be your wish. We also would suggest the need, given requirements of the budget and appropri\u00ad ations processes, to begin the authorization period with fiscal year 1985 instead of 1984 and continue it through fiscal 1987 instead of fiscal 1986. Such an amendment would conform with the companion Senate bill as reported by subcommittee. It also has been suggested that Section 3 (b) (3), which authorizes the Institute to \"make recommendations concerning the proper allocation of responsibility between the State and Federal court systems\", may be in conflict with the bill's prohibition on lobbying by the Institute. We would be amenable to modification or elimination of this provision, particularly in light of pending legislation to create a federal commission to study ques\u00ad tions of state-federal jurisdiction on which the Conference of Chief Justices would be represented. We also think the bill would be improved by an amendment clarifying the fact that approval of projects by a state's highest court must be consistent with State law. The product liability and career criminal bills discussed above are only the latest of the legislative proposals that involve important issues of state-federal jurisdiction. As you are aware the Conference of Chief Justices supports various proposals which would greatly curtail the growth of federal caseloads through elimination of federal jurisdiction in diversity of citizenship cases and through limitations on federal habeas corpus review of state convictions. The Conference also has expressed its willingness to assist the 43 -8- federal courts in the adjudication of federal question cases although we are aware that this could raise many difficult issues. Assumption of diversity cases also would pose serious problems for the metro\u00ad politan courts of several states including New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Florida, and California. But the Conference of Chief Justices is very definitely of the view that caseload and jurisdictional issues are central to problems facing the federal courts and that state courts, with appropriate preparation, can and should relieve the federal courts of a portion of their growing burden. It also is clear that we first must put our own houses in order and that is what we are struggling to do in states throughout the nation. What we have in mind then is an agency which will permit a' sophisticated approach to problems of state courts within our federal system. As you know, state courts not only process the overwhelming majority (98 percent) of the cases in our state- federal judicial system but under the supremacy clause share with the federal courts responsibility for protecting the rights of all citizens under the Constitution and laws of the United States. State courts, of course, existed before the federal courts and the federal constitution, in explicitly providing for only the United States Supreme Court, anticipated that state courts would be the courts of original jurisdiction for federal as well as state law questions. State courts, in fact, did hear federal question cases for the first 100 years of our national life. It was not until the Judiciary Act of 1875 that these 44 cases were moved to the federal courts. But despite the growth of the federal system state courts remain the courts that touch our citizens most intimately and most frequently and it is from their experiences in state courts as litigants, jurors, witnesses or spectators that the vast majority of our citizens make their judgments as to the strengths, weaknesses and fairness of our judicial system. To the average citizen it matters not whether the court is state or federal. His concern is with the fa rness and effectiveness of the judicial process. It has been the very deep concern of state chief justices for the improvement of their own systems that has led us to propose creation of a State Justice Institute. I should note that the studies which led to this proposal were conducted by a Task Force of the Conference of Chief Justices and the Conference of State Court Administrators, in 1978 and 79 and that the legislation was drafted before the Carter administration made its decision not to fund LEAA in fiscal 1981 and to phase the agency out of exist\u00ad ence. Thus, the bill was drafted to accommodate the Institute to the existing LEAA structure. It can stand alone at this time but it also would compliment the new justice assistance program proposed by the House in H.R. 2175. In attempting to summarize this legislation it is important to stress what it would not do. First, and most importantly, the Institute would not be a federally conceived and directed program imposed in any manner on the state courts. That is what we had under LEAA and that is what the State Justice Institute has been designed to correct. This is a proposal of state judicial leaders themselves and has been endorsed by a wide range of judicial and legal interests. It was designed to deal with violations of the separations of powers doctrine inherent in the LEAA program which was controlled at both the state and federal levels by officials of the executive branch; to permit the improvement of courts on a systemwide basis, i.e., in a manner consistent with their interrelated civil and criminal functions; and to protect the independence of state courts to the fullest extent 45 -ID- possible. Second, the legislation does not propose a financial assistance program, i.e., it would not provide funds for salaries or routine operation of courts. This has never been the intention of the legislation and a prohibition on such funding is spelled out explicitly in the bill. We want state courts to remain state courts in every sense and we therefore want the states to retain the basic funding responsibility. Third, the Institute would not be a major burden on the federal taxpayer. Rather, it would be a modestly funded national discretionary program without formula funds and subject to Congressional oversight and annual budget review. Fourth,'the Institute would not create a large new federal bureaucracy. It would function with a small staff in conjunction with existing judicial agencies of the states and the courts themselves. It could support but not duplicate services of existing agencies such as the National Center for State Courts and the National Judicial College. In brief outline, the State Justice Institute would be a federally chartered non\u00ad profit corporation whose policy would be set by a board of directors appointed by the President. The board would be composed of six active state judges representing trial as well as appellate courts, one court administrator, and four public members knowledgeable in matters of judicial interest and concern. The board also would appoint the executive director, set funding priorities, and approve all project grants. Grants would be made on a project basis only with priority going to the courts themselves and to existing national organizations that work in conjunction with them for improvement of the judicial system. The emphasis would be on research, education, demonstration, clearinghouse, and technical assistance programs that are national in scope and would serve the needs of the courts throughout the nation. As this outline indicates, the Institute would have these principal features: \u2014 It would be under control of state judicial officials with first-handed knowledge of the problems facing their courts. 25-622 0-84-4 46 \u2014 It would be responsive directly to the judiciary committees of the Congress and not to unknown middle level officials at the agency or department level for its general program authority, its effectiveness, and its funding requirements. \u2014 It would place the responsibility for improvement of state courts systems on the judicial officials charged with this responsibility under their own state constitutions and laws. \u2014 It would speed the process of court improvement and permit large economies of scale by concentrating on programs of national scope that would serve the needs of all 50 states. And finally, it would put in place an agency capable of speaking and acting on behalf of state court systems as we seek solutions to the complex federal-state jurisdictional issues that are so critical to the future of both federal and state judicial systems. I will only note for now that it is the perceived inadequacies of state judicial systems, whether real or not, that has provided the principal basis for the successful opposition that has been mounted thus far to proposals for abolition of federal diversity of citizenship jurisdiction, and which stand in the way of other possible jurisdictional changes including those that might reduce burdens on the federal courts resulting from habeas petitions by state prisoners and many Section 1983 actions. While LEAA has provided substantial funding for state court projects and is rightly credited with making possible a significant court improvement effort, the relationship between LEAA and state court systems was never a smooth nor well-conceived one. Although state courts were directly affected they were not mentioned in the original Safe Streets legislation in 1968 and became involved in the LEAA program only incrementally and by administrative decision. Congress did not direct its attention to the problems courts were having with LEAA until it amended the act in 1976 to provide a statutory base for judicial 47 -12- participation in the block grant program. The judiciary's complaints were stated in a series of resolutions adopted by the Conference of Chief Justices beginning in 1974. In general, these resolutions made the point that federal funding for state court programs presented a special set of issues that should be dealt with outside the framework of support for the executive branch components of the criminal justice system. In particular, they protested control by executive branch agencies at both the state and federal levels of funds allocated to judicial projects; the difficulty in obtaining funds for projects that involved the civil as well as criminal functions of the courts; and the small percentage of LEAA's block grant funds allocated to judicial programs. The civil-criminal issue was as vexing as the separation-of-power problem. Most courts, of course, perform their civil and criminal functions so as to make separation impossible. Can you imagine, for instance, the Federal Judicial Center conducting a project to improve the processing of criminal cases in the federal district courts without considering its impact on the civil dockets of those courts. It simply could not be done, as programs to implement the Speedy Trial Act have shown. Yet that was expected of courts in many states under the LEAA block grant program. These problems and related issues of concern to state judiciaries have been under discussion for several years before subcommittees of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. Spokemen for the Conference of Chief Justices testified on the issues in 1976 and 1979 at hearings on reauthorization bills for LEAA, and in the 1977 hearings on diversity jurisdiction and Access to Justice. The Conference also expressed its views in statements to the President's Reorganization Project for Justice System Improvement in 1977 and 1978. When efforts to obtain appropriate amendments to the LEAA act failed, the Conference, in 1978, appointed its Task force on a State Court Improvement Act to: 48 -1.3- \"recommend innovative changes in the relations between state courts and the federal government and find ways to improve the administration of justice in the several states without a sacrifice of the independence of state judicial systems.\" Thus, the legislation was developed by state judicial officials themselves to deal with the problems they perceived in their existing relationship with the federal government. In this sense, as Professor Daniel J. Meador stated in testimony in 1980, the State Justice Institute \"does not represent any new or radical departure from already established federal-state relationships.\" From a historical perspective he added, \"the creation of such an entity would be a natural next step in the evolution of the state courts' relationship to the federal government.\" We did not set out, then, to replace LEAA, but to fashion a more effective and constitutionally correct mechanism for bringing national resources and perspectives to bear on the problems of state judiciaries. But our solution does call for an entirely new approach to a national program involving the courts: a federal agency responsive to the needs of 50 independent state courts systems that does not trangress the separation of powers doctrine or violate the principles of federalism. I will not attempt to detail at this-time the kinds of services the Institute would provide or the kinds of programs we would expect to see funded. But is is clear that the initial effort should be directed primarily at national programs with broad application to all, or numerous states. These include national clearinghouse, technical assistance, research and training programs that provide the most cost-effective basis for developing and sharing expertise and experience on a broad range of efforts essential to the modernization of state court systems. Because courts, particularly in states with 49 -14- unified systems, are becoming big business, these include adoption and maintenance of sound management systems with efficient mechanisms for planning, budgeting and accounting; the use of modern technology for the managing and monitoring of caseloads; and the development of reliable statistical data. Assistance also would be provided to state systems seeking means to improve methods for the selection and retention of qualified judges, to conduct educational and training programs for judicial personnel, to reduce legal costs while improving citizen access to the judicial process, to increase citizen involvements in dispute resolution, to guarantee greater judicial accountability, and to structurally reorganize outdated judicial systems. While reliable data on the caseloads of state court systems has not been available historically it is clear these systems have been subjected to the same complex of forces that have led to burgeoning caseloads in the federal courts. State caseloads have become so burdensome, in fact, as to threaten a breakdown of the judicial systems in major metropolitan areas. The problems facing state systems are varied and longstanding. They involve structural and managerial shortcomings as well as qualitative factors in the performance of the basic judicial functions. But as various as the problems may be, they tend to be shared by state courts throughout the national and are amenable to solution through shared national resources if made available on a continuing basis. An important start at providing continuing services has been made by the National Center for State Courts in Williamsburg, Virginia, and the National 3udicial College in Nevada. It is the need we see for an independent agency that underlies, of course, our entire approach. And it is because we see the need as national that we turn to the national government, and not the states, for our support. While the administration of justice is the most fundamental of state responsibilities, the functioning of states courts is, under the supremacy clause, inextricably intertwined with that of the federal courts 50 -15- and is increasingly being affected by Congressional enactments. This point has been made by a number of observers Including Professor Meador who has stated that the administration of justice \"is increasingly becoming an undivided whole, a seamless web,\" because of \"the increasing overlapping of jurisdictions between courts of the states and courts of the Union.\" In both civil and criminal matters, he said, \"state courts today are, to an unprecedented degree, engaged in deciding federal law issues.\" In view of this fact, he added, the federal government can hardly be indifferent to the quality of justice in the states. This point also was stressed in the report of the Conference of Chief Justices' Task Force which found that in virtually all state civil cases the federal government is \"completely dependent upon state judges to implement fundamental federal policies.\" This is true, the Task Force added, whether federal issues before a state judge arise under the supremacy clause or under concurrent jurisdiction resulting from Congressional enactments.. State courts also must process cases arising under the many state laws enacted to implement programs authorized under federal law. This is not intended to argue that the federal government could or should reimburse the states as a quid pro quo. It is only to state the obvious: what the Congress and federal courts do can impact heavily on state courts and what state courts do, or do not do, can affect the federal system. However, the fact of the \"seamless web\" does point to a federal interest in the quality of justice in the states. And this Federal interest, we believe, combined with the many benefits that a State Justice Institute could offer to the federal government as well as the state courts collectively, make it a legitimate national function and responsibility. More directly to the point, there is no organization or procedure through which 50 separate state legislatures can act in concert on a program such as we propose. Nor is there a precedent, to my knowledge, for it. But there is abundant, many would say much too abundant, precedent for federal involvement in such a national program and we believe it will serve the national interest well. 51 -lu- Among other things, the work of the SJI would implement and enhance the work of the Federal Judicial Center, the National Institute of Justice and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. We think it will provide a vehicle by which the Department of Justice and the judiciary committees of the Congress can factor the role of state courts into their thinking as they consider legislation impacting on the total justice system; state as well as federal. We think the SJI will promote a healthy competition for excellence between our various state systems, as well as with the federal courts, and use to the fullest the marvelous laboratory for experimentation in new approaches provided by the 50 independent state courts under our federal system; and we think the SJI respects the separation of powers and makes federal what is best done at the national level while leaving the basic responsibility for the administration of justice to the states where it belongs. This is our understanding, at least, of what the Federal system is all about. Before closing I will briefly address the budgetary concerns that necessarily are involved in a new program such as we propose. The Conference of Chief Justices, as I have indicated, believes the State Justice Institute will be the catalyst for reforms that will result in substantial benefits for the federal judiciary as well as the states. For instance, a recent study by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shows that the federal courts, through elimination of diversity jurisdiction alone, would save $I80.6-million over the next five years in reduced costs for new judges, court facilities, clerks, etc. On the other hand,-the State Justice Institute, even if fully funded at the H.R.3\u00bb0f authorization levels in would cost only $70-million over the next three years. Over the long term, obviously, the cost-benefit ratio could be even more in favor of the federal government. I should also comment briefly on the role assigned the Conference of Chief Justices in choosing the board of directors for the Institute. This may appear self- serving to some and an unnecessary limitation on the President's appointing authority. 52 -1.7- But the considerations that led to this provision are eminently practical and, we believe, necessary if the Institute is to achieve its major purposes. Under the statutes and constitutions of most states Chief Justices are the officials most clearly responsible to the public for the operation of judicial systems. Thus, the bill places ultimate responsibility for SJI funded programs of state and local courts on the state's highest court. They can take the credit, or the blame for them. But who, other than a small and transient Board of Directors, is to be responsible to the Congress for the operation of the Institute itself? As the national organization of the highest state judicial officials, we believe the Conference of Chief Justices can play a broader and more effective role in this regard. This is especially true if we view the Institute as the vehicle by which state courts systems collectively can assist in the formulation and implementation of policies, some of which may involve federal legislation, that will affect both the state and federal judicial systems. In this role we believe it is important that the Institute reflect the views of state judicial leaders accountable to their own citizens and state governments. In other words, the Institute should reflect a concensus of state judicial opinion on important political issues if it is to fulfill one of its basic functions i.e., to serve as an institution through which state courts collectively can work over the long term with the federal government on matters of mutual concern, particularly questions of jurisdiction and federal review of state convictions which are likely to remain with us for many years to come. The bill now requires the Conference, in selecting panels of nominees for the President, \"to obtain and consider the recommendations of all interested organizations and individuals concerned with the administration of justice and the objectives of this Act.\" It also requires that the Board \"shall have both judicial and nonjudicial members, and shall, to the extent practicable, have a membership representing a variety of backgrounds and reflecting participation and interest in the administration of justice.\" 53 -1.8- It has been our understanding from the beginning that the judicial members of the Board would be representative of trial and special courts as well as appellate courts. It has never been our intention that Chief Justices constitute a majority of the Board and we do not believe this would be the result under the bill in its present form. But we do think it important that the Conference have a role in the nominating process and we are very firmly of the opinion that it should be retained. In summary the State Justice Institute has been proposed by state judicial leaders as the mechanism by which they can focus attention on the many common issues facing them and deal with these issues in the most appropriate and. efficient manner. Our experience with LEAA funding, however brief, taught us how much we could accomplish with even very limited amounts of discretionary money, the kind of money that we simply have not been able to obtain from state legislatures who tend to be afflicted with what Professor Maurice Rosenberg has termed the disease of \"erractic thriftness\" but whose attention is understandably directed to state level and not national level concerns. The Conference of Chief Justices believes, then, that the State Justice Institute is essential if state courts are to: \u2014 Handle appropriately within a state context and without federal intervention growing national problems such as those associated with the fields of product liability and asbestos litigation; \u2014 Assume as they should the burden of federal diversity cases which constituted nearly 25 percent of federal civil filings in 1982; \u2014 Reduce the need for federal habeas corpus and civil rights actions by state prisoners which constituted some 12 percent of federal civil filings in 1982; \u2014 Eliminate the need for federal prosecution and trial of state career criminals and the expansion of federal jurisdiction and caseloads that this entails; and \u2014 Have an effective voice in the formulation of national policies and programs for improvement of the administration of justice and to marshal the resources needed to implement these programs and policies. 54 We think it essential, in short, if state courts are to adequately fulfill their role in our federal system and federal courts are to remain courts of limited jurisdiction with their special place in our constitutional scheme. Thank you again for this opportunity to present our views. Chief Justice Carrico is prepared to expand on these introductory remarks, if you wish, and we will be pleased to respond to any questions you might have. Mr. KASTENMEIER. We are very pleased to hear from you again, Justice Utter, a most able presentation. I do not know that you cov\u00ad ered everything in your statement, but to the extent that you may not have, your statement, in its entirety has been, of course, made a part of the record. Chief Justice Carrico, I know you have a very brief statement. We would be very pleased to hear from you before we go on to questions. [The statement of Justice Carrico follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE VIRGINIA STATE SUPREME COURT, HARRY L. CARRICO Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to appear before this distinguished subcommittee to voice my support and the support of my peers across the country for the creation of the State Justice Institute. I endorse wholeheartedly the remarks of Justice Utter, who has worked prodigiously on behalf of the Conference of Chief Justices to bring the Institute to this point in its development. We are very grateful, Mr. Chairman, for the support the Institute proposal has received in this and prior Congresses. These indications of support demonstrate to me a rather solid interest in the worthiness of the Institute's purpose, as expressed in section 3(a)(1) of the bill you are now considering: \"to further the development and adoption of improved judicial administration in State courts in the United States.\" May this interest be sufficient to make the Institute a reality at this ses\u00ad sion. It is in the national interest, I believe, to improve judicial administration in state courts; after all, they handle 96 percent of the cases filed throughout the country. And these are not just run-of-the mine cases. Included are matters of major con\u00ad stitutional and precedential importance, involving complex questions of both Fed\u00ad eral and State law. A State judge, almost as much as his or her Federal counter\u00ad part, must keep abreast of changes in Federal law, for he or she is called upon regularly to apply some Federal decisional or statutory rule. Hence, it is essential that State judges have opportunities for further study in all aspects of the law. The Institute could be of material assistance in providing these opportunities. Sec\u00ad tion 3(a)(2)(b)(5) of the proposed legislation states that the Institute \"shall . . . en\u00ad courage education for judges and support personnel of State court systems through National and State organizations, including universities.\" And section 6(aX5) author\u00ad izes the Institute \"to award grants and enter into cooperative agreements or con\u00ad tracts ... in order to . . . encourage and assist in the furtherance of judicial educa\u00ad tion.\" I consider this one of the more significant features of the proposed legislation; I happen to believe that providing judicial education is one of the most pressing needs of the day. No one should be subjected to a doctor who fails to keep abreast of devel\u00ad opments in the field of medicine. Nor should any citizen be required to submit his or her important affairs to a judge who decides cases on the basis of last year's law. While one's freedom and property may not be as dear as his or her health, the dif\u00ad ference is in degree only, and a slight degree at that. There are, of course, other important features of the proposed legislation, all- di\u00ad rected, I believe, to strengthening and improving the State court systems. In sum, quoting the language of section 3(b)(1), the legislation would provide a source of funding to enable the Institute to \"direct a national program of assistance designed to assure each person ready access to a fair and effective system of justice.\" With 55 this as its goal, the Institute, if created, would bring new meaning to something Chief Justice Burger once said: \"The state courts of this country are the basic in\u00ad strument of justice under our system, and this, of course, is the heart of what we call federalism.\" Judge CARRICO. Thank you very much. I am Harry L. Carrico. I am the chief justice of the supreme court of Virginia and I appreciate the opportunity to appear before this distinguished subcommittee to voice my support and the sup\u00ad port of my peers throughout the country for the creation of the State Justice Institute. I endorse wholeheartedly the remarks just made by Justice Utter. He has worked prodigiously on behalf of the Conference of Chief Justices to bring the Institute to this point in its develop\u00ad ment, and we are indebted to him for his dedicated attention to this project. We are very grateful in the conference, Mr. Chairman, for the support the Institute proposal has received in this and prior Con\u00ad gresses. These indications of support demonstrate to me a rather solid interest in the worthiness of the Institute's purpose, as ex\u00ad pressed in section 3(a)(1) of the bill you are now considering, \"To further the development and adoption of improved judicial admin\u00ad istration in State courts in the United States.\" May this interest be sufficient to make the Institute a reality at this session of Congress. It is in the national interest, I believe, to improve judicial admin\u00ad istration in State courts. After all, they handle, as has been indi\u00ad cated here this afternoon, from 95 to 98 percent of the cases filed throughout the country. These are not just run-of-the-mine cases. Included are matters of major constitutional and precedential im\u00ad portance involving complex questions of both Federal and State law. The State judge, almost as much as his or her Federal counter\u00ad part, must keep abreast of changes in Federal law, for he or she is called upon regularly to apply some Federal decisional or statutory rule. We believe, therefore, that it is essential that State judges have opportunities for further study in all aspects of the law. The Institute could be of material assistance in providing these opportunities. Section 3(a)(2)(B)(5) of the proposed legislation states that the Institute shall \"encourage education for judges and sup\u00ad port personnel of State court systems through national and State organizations, including universities.\" Section 6(a)(5) authorizes the Institute to award grants and enter into cooperative agreements or contracts in order to \"encourage and assist in the furtherance of judicial education.\" I consider this one of the more significant features of the pro\u00ad posed legislation. I happen to believe that providing judicial educa\u00ad tion is one of the most pressing needs of the day. No one should be subjected to a doctor who fails to keep abreast of the latest developments in the field of medicine. Nor should any citizen be required to submit his or her important affairs to a judge who decides cases on the basis of last year's law. 56 While one's freedom and property may not be as dear as his or her health, the difference is in degree only, and a slight degree at that. There are, of course, other important features in the proposed legislation, all directed, I believe, to strengthening and improving the State court systems. In sum, according to the language of section 3(b)(1), the legisla\u00ad tion would provide a source of funding to enable the Institute to direct a national program of assistance designed to assure each person ready access to a fair and effective system of justice. With this as its goal, the Institute, if created, would bring new meaning to something Chief Justice Burger once said: \"The State courts of this country are the basic instrument of justice under our system, and this, of course, is the heart of what we call 'federal\u00ad ism.' \" Again, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to appear and to express my gratitude to the committee for its support of this bill. Mr. KASTENMEIER. We are indebted to you, Chief Justice Carrico, for your appearance here and your amplifying comments. May I ask you to define the term \"State court.\" Are we talking about any court of a State that would be a court of record or is there any necessity for defining further what courts are to be in\u00ad cluded? Judge CARRICO. I would hope, sir, the Institute would not be lim\u00ad ited or confined to courts of record. We have a three-tiered court system in Virginia. On the lower level is the district court, with one part devoted to the trial of civil and criminal matters and the other to juvenile and domestic relations cases. Then there is the circuit court, which is the trial court of records, and at the top is the supreme court. It is with the courts at the lower level that the public has the greatest contact, and for many people the only contact with a court they ever have in their lives. We are undertaking at the moment, for example, a study to determine the feasibility of creating a new court in Virginia handling only family matters. As things stand now, there is a concurrence of jurisdiction between the juvenile and domestic relations courts and the circuit courts in domestic re\u00ad lations matters, which produces a yo-yo effect. Litigants are shifted backward and forward between the two courts at great expense and prolongation of litigation of a type that ought to be ended as early as possible. I foresee the Institute making funds available to national organi\u00ad zations involved in family court matters, juvenile and domestic re\u00ad lations matters, that could in turn provide the necessary studies to help us to come to a determination on the feasibility of instigating a family court. So I would hope that the services of the Institute would be avail\u00ad able to any court in the State system of justice. Mr. KASTENMEIER. I have one or two other questions, but I would like to yield first to my colleagues. The gentleman from California, Mr. Moorhead. Mr. MOORHEAD. I want to join our chairman in thanking you both for being here today. 57 If this legislation would become law, what issues do you antici\u00ad pate would be priority items for the State Justice Institute? Judge UTTER. I would think at least two of the issues addressed by acts of this Congress. The issue of career criminals, how they are handled, is of great importance. Our concern is not that those issues not be addressed, but that they be addressed in a way that can be effectively processed by the States. The whole area of product liability, the massive number of cases and the inability of those cases to be resolved in the courts, is of great interest, not only to the Federal Government, but to State courts as well. Our concern, again, is not that that issue not be ad\u00ad dressed, but that it be addressed in a way that preserves the integ\u00ad rity of the State system without overburdening the Federal system as well. I would hope that if it is the will of Congress that diversity juris\u00ad diction be removed from the Federal system, we could effectively find a way to handle those cases in State courts. Our courts have expressed a willingness to not only address that problem, but to take over that responsibility. It cannot be done lightly, as you know, Mr. Congressman. For the State of California to assume the diversity cases that are now before the Federal courts in your State, would be a massive burden. Mr. MOORHEAD. They are jammed already. Judge UTTER. They are, sir. But that is the type of issue, I think the type of priority issue that I would hope this State Justice Insti\u00ad tute would enable us to be able to sit down with concerned Mem\u00ad bers of Congress and address ways in which we can both help each other. The other issues, the administrative ones are multiple and let me just run over the list quickly without commenting exhaustively on them. The problems of selection and removal of judges, how that can be done effectively is always an issue of proper judicial admin\u00ad istration. Education and training was commented on by Chief Justice Car- rico. The question of meeting Federal law with Federal funds that are provided to the State courts is a continuing issue clogging State courts and we need to address how that can be done effectively. Court organization and finance, we need to be more sophisticated in the way we address those problems. Court planning and budgeting, court management statistics, court delay. The question of judicial performance in the States; how do you rate what kind of job a judge is doing in a way to both help him if he can be helped, and remove him if he should be re\u00ad moved. Court rules, responsiveness to public needs, access to courts, public education, all these are areas that I think the State Justice Institute would address. Mr. MOORHEAD. YOU know, when we consider these diversity bills we get from time to time in this committee, and there is always one that is introduced, there is one major reason sitting behind that opposes it, and that is that most lawyers want to be able to shop for a court. Judge UTTER. Of course. 58 Mr. MOORHEAD. The second argument that is given that the qual\u00ad ity of the State courts\u2014and speaking for California, I think the quality is extremely high, as I am sure it is in the States in which you gentlemen preside as chief justices and many of the other larger States. There is some problem, I assume, in some of the smaller jurisdictions, but it would seem to me that if we did get the State Justice Institute Act adopted, it would have a tendency to raise the standards in all of the States and maybe do away with the argument that has been traditionally used. Judge UTTER. That is our hope. That is our hope and I heartily concur with it. Mr. MOORHEAD. You probably know that most of us on this sub\u00ad committee have already sponsored the legislation. We think that something should be done of this kind and we certainly hope that we can work together with you as we consider the legislation on any amendments, any ways that the legislation can be made more beneficial or effective. Judge UTTER. Thank you. Judge CARRICO. Thank you. Mr. KASTENMEIER. The gentleman from Ohio, Mr. DeWine. Mr. DEWINE. NO questions, Mr. Chairman. Mr. KASTENMEIER. I just have one or two questions. I know Jus\u00ad tice Utter has been through this before and most of the basic ques\u00ad tions have been asked. One of the functions that the Institute could serve is to voice the collective interests or problems confronting State judicial systems generally. I think you have indicated that. In what fashion would it be superior to the representations that you make on behalf of the Conference of the Chief Justices of the States? Judge UTTER. We would like to assume that the Conference of Chief Justices speaks for everyone and like to feel that the world focuses on us. Unfortunately, if you speak to the trial judges and the court of appeals judges and the court administrators, the juve\u00ad nile court judges and the probate judges, they are quick to point out that while we do have the final authority in the States, we do not have their complete perspective on the problems. I think that is one of the things, Mr. Chairman, that the State Justice Institute would be able to perform that would differ greatly in scope from what the Conference of Chief Justices does. As point\u00ad ed out in our discussions and in our reports, the basis of member\u00ad ship on the Board of Directors of the Institute is a broadbased one. It would include members, I would hope, from all levels of the trial courts. I think we cannot overlook that it is the chief justices who will have to carry out the policies in the States and that is an impor\u00ad tant distinction to make. The act will not work if it goes in opposi\u00ad tion, in effect, to what the chief justices feel needs to be done in the States, because they are the ones who are responsible to the execu\u00ad tive branch and to the voters for the execution of policy. But the Institute gives a much broader base from which to enun\u00ad ciate that policy than the Conference does. I yield to my colleague, Chief Justice Carrico, on that. 59 Judge CARRICO. I think that is the complete answer to the ques\u00ad tion. Unless all levels of the judiciary in the States feel themselves a part of this, it, of course, will not succeed. I think that in the way the Institute is proposed, both the lowest and highest judge can have a say in the policies that will be voiced through the Institute. I think that is very important. Mr. KASTENMEIER. AS a followup on that, I believe the legislation contains what might be commonly known as an antilobbying provi\u00ad sion and I am not that sanguine about what precisely the language is. Would that run counter to the function we are talking about in terms of enabling the Institute to speak with a single voice as to concerns of the problems of the State judicial systems? On page 20, a restriction on activities of the Institute, section 8(aX3) says \"The Institute shall not undertake to influence the pas\u00ad sage or defeat of any legislation of the Congress of the United States or by any State or local legislative body, except,\" and then there are some exceptions. I am wondering when you consider that language if it is unduly restrictive in terms of your concept of the operation of the Insti\u00ad tute. Judge CARRICO. When I read that, Mr. Chairman, I thought it at first a curious provision, but then when I thought about it, I could see the merit of it. As you indicate, there are exceptions. They are very broad exceptions and would, I believe, permit the personnel of the Institute to do those things that it would be set up to do. I have always wondered where lobbying begins and where it ends because those of us in the State judiciary have to have certain con\u00ad tacts with our State legislatures. I would hate to be accused of having lobbied. I look upon lobbying as standing in the halls of our State capitol and buttonholing members of the legislature as they go by and importuning them for a raise effective the beginning of the next biennium. But I think it is perfectly proper under the Canons of Judicial Ethics for judges to appear before legislative committees, legisla\u00ad tive groups, to support and urge the passage of any measure that aids in the administration of justice. I would hope that the inter\u00ad pretation put on this provision would permit that same activity, but would discourage, in fact, prohibit, the sort of buttonholing ac\u00ad tivity we look on as perhaps not being consistent with a judicial group. Mr. KASTENMEIER. Well, I think you are undoubtedly correct. The exceptions are broad and ought to permit appropriate testimo\u00ad ny, appearances, or communications. However, you might review that just to make sure that it is not going to prove to be an unan\u00ad ticipated burden in some respect in terms of inhibiting what the Institute really ought to be doing or ought to be involved in. Judge CARRICO. Could we communicate our views to the subcom\u00ad mittee if we feel the provisions are too restrictive? Mr. KASTENMEIER. Yes; please, by letter to the subcommittee. Judge CARRICO. By letter, right. Mr. KASTENMEIER. We would encourage you to do so. [The information follows:] 60 JUSTICES W. CARRINGTON THOMPSON ROSCOE B. STEPHENSON, JR. CHARLES S. RUSSELL SENIOR JUSTICE SUPREME COURT OF VIRGINIA SUPREME COURT BUILDING RICHMOND,VIRGINIA 23219 CLERK ALLEN L.LUCY DEPUTY CLERK DAVID B. BEACH EXECUTIVE SECRETARY ROBERT N.BALDWIN ASST. EXECUTIVE SECRETARY FREDERICK A. MOONETT, JR. CHIEF STAFF ATTORNEY JOHN THOMAS BRUCE STATE REPORTER WEILL H.AL/ORD,JR. October 5, 1983 The Honorable Robert W. Kastenmeier Chairman, Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties, and the Administration of Justice 3127 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, D.C. 20510 Dear Mr. Chairman: This is to supplement my testimony at the sub\u00ad committee's hearing July 13, 1983 on H.R. 3403, the State Justice Institute Act, and addresses the anti-lobbying provisions of the bill, Sec. 8(a)(3), which provide that the Institute shall not: \"undertake to influence the passage or defeat of any legislation by the Congress of the United States or by any State or local legis\u00ad lative body, except that personnel of the Institute may testify or make other appropriate communication-- (A) when formally requested to do so by a legislative body; committee, or a member thereof; (B) in connection with legislation or ap\u00ad propriations directly affecting the activities of the Institute, or (C) in connection with legislation or ap\u00ad propriations dealing with improvements in the State Judiciary, consistent with the provisions of this Act.\" You asked if these provisions might not be too restrictive for the Institute to act, as the Conference of Chief Justices believes it should, as a national representa\u00ad tive of state court systems. 61 The Honorable Robert W. Kastenmeier October 5, 1983 Page 2. In our view these restrictions should not unduly confine the Institute but only assure Congress and the public that its activities will be limited to programs for improvement of the courts. We fully support the ban on all partisan activity and any lobbying unrelated to the Insti\u00ad tute's basic functions. But we believe the Institute should be free to speak and act on behalf of state courts in recom\u00ad mending new initiatives or when actions by the Congress or agencies of the federal executive and judicial branches are likely to affect the operations of state judicial systems. To this end it may be helpful to add a subpara-' graph (D) to Sec. 8(a) which would specifically authorize the Institute to present its views to Congress and State legilsatures: \"in connection with any legislation or con\u00ad stitutional amendment affecting the powers, jurisdiction, or independence of state court systems.\" . Such a provision would be consistent with two other provisions of the bill which specifically authorize the Institute to cooperate with executive and judicial branch agencies of both state and federal governments. For instance Sec. (6)(a)(3) , authorizes the Institute to: \"participate in joint projects with govern\u00ad ment agencies, including the Federal Judicial Center, with respect to the purposes of this Act.\" We believe this authorizes the Institute to work with such federal agencies as the National Institute of Justice,.the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the Judicial Conference of the United States, and the Administrative Office of the United States Courts as well as the Federal Judicial Center. A second provision, Sec. 4(k)(4), directs the Institute's Board of Directors to: 25-622 0-84-5 62 The Honorable Robert W. Kastenmeier October 5, 1983 Page 3. \"present, to government departments, agencies, and instrumentalities whose programs or activities relate to the administration of justice in the State judiciaries of the United States, the recommendations of the Institute for the improvement of such programs or activities..\" To overcome any doubt about the Institute's authority to independently communicate its views to Congress and state legislatures this section could be amended to add the under\u00ad lined language below: \"present, to legislative committees and to government departments, agencies, etc.\" Both of the suggested amendments are more technical than substantive in nature but we would urge their adoption to overcome any possible doubt as to the Institute's authority to speak for state judiciaries in either state or national forums. Yours very truly, Harry L. Carrico Chief Justice HLC/cl 63 Mr. KASTENMEIER. Actually, under the bill, of course, the board of directors decides where to locate the Institute. Do you have any feelings about that? Would it be better if the legislation situated the Institute or do you think in good time the board of directors would be the more appropriate deciding source? Judge UTTER. We had initially, when the act first was proposed, indicated Washington, D.C., as the location of the Institute. I think every bit of logic in the world directs that it be very near Washing\u00ad ton, D.C., but someone pointed out that if we mandated that it be here, we have locked ourselves into the rents and the costs that are here in the District as well. That was the sole reason, Mr. Chairman, for changing that in subsequent drafts of the bill. I cannot imagine it being located any\u00ad where other than close to the Capitol, given the mandate of the act. I think if the act is passed, you may well find us either in Fair\u00ad fax County or in Maryland, just over the border. Judge CARRICO. I would extend a special invitation for the Insti\u00ad tute to come to Fairfax, Mr. Chairman. That is my home county, as well as being in my beloved State. Mr. KASTENMEIER. Well, we already have a facility down in Wil\u00ad liamsburg. Judge CARRICO. I think we all feel this way, Mr. Chairman: We so much want to see this Institute a reality that the location of its headquarters becomes rather a secondary matter. Mr. KASTENMEIER. I appreciate that and I appreciate your com\u00ad ments. There is a vote on. I would like to take this occasion to state to you that we will make every effort to move this legislation for\u00ad ward this year. We appreciate your appearance, Chief Justice Car\u00ad rico, and of course, again the appearance of\u2014for the third or fourth times, perhaps\u2014of Justice Robert Utter. Thank you, gentle\u00ad men. Judge CARRICO. Thank you, sir. Judge UTTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. KASTENMEIER. If Professor Etheridge will indulge us, I would like to say 10 minutes. I understand the system broke down and we may be taking the votes by other methods. So it might be a bit longer, but it should be about 10 or 15 minutes hopefully. Until that time, we will stand in recess. [Recess.] Mr. KASTENMEIER. The committee will come to order. Incidentally, the Chair would like to state that the statement of the Judicial Conference, represented by the Honorable Elmo B. Hunter, U.S. District Judge for the Western District of Missouri, on this subject is received and, without objection, made part of this record. [The statement of Judge Hunter follows:] 64 PREPARED STATEMENT OF HONOKABLE ELR: D B. HUNTER UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI AND CHAIRMAN OF THE' COMMITTEE ON COURT ADMINISTRATION OF THE JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON COURTS, CIVIL LIBERTIES AND THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON H.R. 3403 WEDNESDAY JULY 13, 1983 65 Mr. Chairman, and distinguished members of the Subcommittee, I am pleased to be able to submit written testimony on behalf of the Judicial Conference of the United States on the subject of the creation of a St te Justice Institute as envisioned in H.R. 3403. I am pleased that you have reintroduced this important measure. I regret that I could not appear before you in person, but long-standing commitments prevent me from doing so. As Chairman of the Judicial Conference's Committee on Court Administration, I am pleased to present the views of the Conference in support of this legislation. Over the last decade, major strides have been taken to improve the State court systems through the gracious efforts of the Conference of State Chief Justices, the National Center for State Courts and a variety of other bodies. However, the State court systems need additional, on-going, permanent support to sustain an innovative momentum and to allow the States fiscal freedom to institutionalize Innovations that have proven effective. Many organizations have supported innovation and research in the State court systems in the past. While the federal judicial system will not be directly affected by the creation of a State Justice Institute, there are clear benefits that will flow from the work of the Institute. There is an ongoing interchange of ideas between the federal and State court systems, perhaps best illustrated in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure: many States have adopted the Federal Rules and you will find that State rules of procedure were the basis on which many federal rules were originally drafted. We continue to develop ways in.which the federal and State courts can learn from each other. My committee has a Subcommittee on Federal - State Relations composed of both federal and State judges. If H.R. 3403 becomes law, I hope that the Subcommittee on Federal - State Relations will become the focal point of our relations with the State Justice Institute. - 1 -66 Substantive Elements of the Bill Section 1 of H.R. 3403, of course, appropriately titles the bill. Section 2 of the bin defines, among others, the term \"State\" to appropriately include not only the States, but the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories. Inclusion of these political entities, while not technica y \"States'-, is important; the judicial systems of the District, Commonwealth and the territories should also benefit from the creation and function of the Institute and should be accorded the opportunity to contribute to its goals. Section 3 establishes the Institute with the purpose of furthering \"the development and adoption of improved judicial administration in State courts of the United States.\" The Institute is authorized to be incorporated in any State and to exercise the powers of a nonprofit corporation under the laws of the State of incorporation. The Institute is directed to do several very noteworthy things that I would like to emphasize. First, the Institute would direct a national program of assistance to assure that each person has access to a fair and effective system of justice. The State court systems are and will remain the primary systems for delivery of legal and equitable justice. I would not suggest that any State court system is either unfair or ineffective, but all court systems can learn from each other and improve procedures for the delivery of legal and equitable justice. There is a need for a national program to encourage cross- fertilization. Second, the Institute would foster coordination and cooperation between the federal and State courts and make recommendations concerning the proper allocation of responsibility between the federal and State systems. The concept of Federalism should be constantly studied. This is an area that our Subcommittee on Federal - State Relations has already taken up and further consideration is welcomed. Third, the Institute would promote recognition of the importance of the separation of powers to the independence of judicial systems under our Constitution and the State 67 constitutions. The doctrine of separation of powers is not very well understood; its history is more anecdotal than analytical. Many different structures of a Republican form of government can function effectively within a democratic society, but all carry forward the idea of separate, if mixed, powers. There is a real need for further illumination of the doctrine as it is reflected in Judicial systems and f <ch an undertaking by the Institute is a laudible goal. Finally, the Institute would encourage education for judges and State court personnel. Many organizations undertake parts of the continuing educational function of judges and State court administrative personnel, but the Institute would undertake this responsibility on a much broader, coordinative scale. The Institute would be required not to duplicate functions that are already being adequately performed by existing organizations. This limitation is very important. The Institute is given a broad, umbrella role in the promotion of efficiency and effectiveness in the State court systems, but where a particular function is being performed well, there is little sense in duplicating that work; rather there is a great deal of sense in fostering and coordinating that work with others. Section 6 of the bill provides one of the major operating means for the Institute: the awarding of grants and the performance of cooperative agreements and contracts in carrying out its mission. These grants and contracts are authorized for the conduct of research and demonstration projects, to serve as a clearinghouse for information on the State judicial systems, to participate in joint projects with government agencies, Including the Federal Judicial Center, to evaluate its programs, to encourage and assist in judicial education, and to provide consulting and technical services. These grants and contracts would be available to State and local governmental bodies, and a matching grant of 25% would be required. Section 13 authorizes a very modest appropriation for each of the next three fiscal years, but the Institute is also authorized to receive funds from other sources, functioning as a non-profit corporation. - 3 -68 Under section 4, the Institute would be supervised by a Board of Directors consisting of six judges, one court administrator and four other members. The Conference of State Chief Justices is required to submit a list of fourteen judges and court administrators to the President for consideration. The Conference of State Chief Justices is eminently qualified to suggest individuals who would be fit to serve ->n the Board of Directors of the Institute. Nominations by the President for all positions on the Board are subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. I have one small suggestion at this point. Section 4(aX4) requires that the President nominate the Board of Directors within sixty days of the enactment of the bill. It would seem to me that sixty days is a very short period of time for the Conference of State Chief Justices to determine an initial panel of suggested Board members and for the President to consider that suggestion. I would, of course, defer to their judgment, but I do suggest that this timing question be given further consideration. I will not delve into the technicalities of corporate life and detail the authority and duties of the Board, but each and all appear to be both reasonable and appropriate. Nor will I detail the procedures and limitations placed upon the Institute's authority to make grants and contracts. In each of these matters, I would defer to the your judgment with the simple note that the entire structure appears to me to suit the purposes intended for the Institute. Policy Factors Supporting Enactment I suspect that I need to say very little to convince this Subcommittee of the need and appropriateness of this legislation. State courts have provided and will continue to provide the broadest range of judicial \"citizen service\". Federal support, together with the authority of the Institute to receive funds from other sources, win help assure that State courts continue to be the most useful and effective courts for the adjudication, both quickly and with less expense, of many of the disputes in our society. The purposes to be served by creating a State Justice Institute are endorsed by the 4 -69 Judicial Conference. In light of the increased need for coordination between State and federal courts, the Judicial Conference has established a subcommittee of my committee to deal exclusively with federal-State relations, as I have previously noted. This subcommittee is chaired by Judge Mary Anne Richey, a United States District Judge for the District of Arizona. Chief Justice Albert W. Barney, Jr., of the Supreme Court of Vermont, and a past chairman of the Conference of Chief Justices, is a member of that Subcommittee. In addition, three other State judges are members of the Subcommittee on Federal-State Relations, include Justice George Danielson, your former colleague. Through this subcommittee and my committee, the Judicial Conference will be studying various issues relating to ways to improve the division of federal and Stats court jurisdiction, coordination of areas of common concern and improving the ability of our respective systems to function harmoniously within our Constitutional dual system of courts. We look forward to a productive interchange of ideas with the Institute on^e it has been established. One specific area of interest of this subcommittee is the creation and operation of the State Justice Institute. Over the years, funding for innovation in the Stale court systems has been erratic at best. States have been required to commit operating funds to experimentation, when operating funds have been scarce for the contemporary operation of the system. The creation of an umbrella organization specifically to provide funding and guidance in innovation will be welcomed by all judges, both State and federal. It is important that the Institute not provide funding for the day-to-day operation of the State court systems. The ultimate choice of whether a particular program or improvement should be implemented on a permanent basis should belong to the State judges and the State legislatures. But, at the same time, funds need to be provided on an independent basis for the court systems to innovate and expand our understanding of judicial administration. Through the State Justice Institute, as structured in H.R. 3403, not only would the Institute have federal funds with which to 5 -70 make grants, but would have the added authority to receive funds from private sources \u2014 whether foundations, individuals, estates, or others \u2014 as a supplemental source of income and grant distribution. This would bridge the gap between State financing and private endowment to the benefit of the administration of justice. Legislative Background Legislation to create the State Justice Institute was first approved by the Senate and by this Subcommittee during the 96th Congress. H.R. 2407, in the 97th Congress, received the approval of this Subcommittee and the current proposal is a reintroduction of that bill. In the Senate, S. 537 was approved last year and a similar measure, Title IV of S. 645, was recently approved by the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Courts. Recent action in the Senate and these hearings hopefully portend final enactment of this much needed legislation. The Judicial Conference evaluated the proposals in the 97th Congress during its meeting in March of 1982, Conf. Rept., p. 20, and recommended enactment. I am pleased to support the passage of this legislation on behalf of the Judicial Conference. 1 personally believe we need the State Justice Institute to make further improvements in the judicial systems of the nation. We look forward to working closely with the Conference of Chief Justices and the National Center for State Courts toward this end and the operation of the Institute. - 6 -71 Mr. KASTENMEIER. Also, the Chair will state that we are in re\u00ad ceipt of a letter of July 7, 1983\u2014to which is attached two letters, one dated September 22, 1980; the other September 17, 1982. All three letters are from the Chief Justice of the United States, the Honorable Warren E. Burger. Those, too, will be received and made a part of the record.

KASTENMEIER: The Legislative Affairs Office of the Administrative Office has informed me that you have reintroduced a bill to create a State Justice Institute, H.R. 3403. I thank you for your continuing efforts to create this important Institute. We have corresponded on this matter on several occasions in the past and I reaffirm my wholehearted support for this proposal. I know that the Conference of State Chief Justices will appreciate your work as do 1.1 have enclosed copies of my previous letters to you for your use. Cordially, WARREN E. BURGER. SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, \" Washington, DC, September 22, 1980. Hon. ROBERT W. KASTENMEIER, Chairman, Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties, and the Administration of Jus\u00ad tice, House Judiciary Committee, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC DEAR MR. KASTENMEIER: I thank you and the Members of the Subcommittee for an opportunity to submit my personal views for inclusion in your hearing record on the State Justice Institute Act of 1980. I am happy that you have been able to devote time to evaluating this proposal in this busy year, and I take this opportuni\u00ad ty to comment upon an idea which I believe to be significant, not only for our courts, but also for the public. During my service as Chief Justice, I have been concerned with the problems of our state courts as well as those of our federal courts. The problems of justice are indivisible. If this Nation does not maintain a strong and effective court system at both the federal and state levels, our people will be denied justice. The value of any court system depends not only upon the soundness and fairness of its laws, but also upon its ability to \"deliver\" justice expeditiously and efficiently\u2014and economical- ' ly\u2014to those who seek it. My lifetime experience as a citizen, lawyer, and judge, has convinced me that the basic system of justice in this country always has been, and should continue to be, our state courts. If they are not efficient and effective, federal judicial efforts can never compensate the public adequately. Even if 800 federal judges were to be mul\u00ad tiplied many times in number, they would still never be able to completely \"deliver\" justice as the state courts can. Soine-26;\u00a900state court-judges handle 98 percent of all the judicial business in America's courts. Peoples' access to justice and their im\u00ad pressions of our judicial system are overwhelmingly influenced by their contact with our state court systems. Those systems cannot be effective unless they are adequate\u00ad ly supported, not only with funding, but also with managerial ideas and talent. Our federal judicial system was intended and structured to be a complement to our state judicial systems. That complementary relationship embodies our constitu\u00ad tional concepts of federalism and separation of powers. It was for this reason I pro\u00ad posed creation of the State-Federal Judicial Councils 11 years ago. More than 40 states now have such bodies. Since the state courts process the majority of the Na\u00ad tion's judicial work, any \"shortfalls\" in their performance will deny most litigants a tribunal. We must avoid any situation in which federal courts are pressured to become a refuge for citizens who seek a federal forum, not because their claim is of a truly federal nature, but because state courts are inadequate. Should our people ever lose confidence in their state courts, not only will our federal courts become more and more overburdened, but a pervasive lack of confidence in all courts will 72 develop. All courts, federal and state, rely upon public trust and public confidence. Their integrity is the key to their validity. Just as justice is indivisible, the public perception of justice is indivisible. People generally do not distinguish between federal and state courts. The public is not con\u00ad cerned with the details of jurisdiction or interested in excuses. They are paying the bills for both systems and they want results. There is, therefore, clearly an overriding national interest in improving access to and confidence in our state courts. Important as it is, our concept of federalism is not the only objective requiring their preservation. Our state courts are close to the people and they are the primary safeguard of the rights and privileges of individ\u00ad uals under both state and federal law. Together with our federal courts, they pre\u00ad serve and vindicate those rights guaranteed under the Constitution and federal laws. In recent years, national legislative policies and programs have increased the number of such federal rights adjudicated in state courts. The role our state courts play in evaluating and arbitrating the enforcement of state policies, and the state enforcement of national legislative policies and programs, is most significant. Our national interest in strong state court systems renders national support for them entirely appropriate. Certain legitimate national objectives can only be achieved by our state courts within our federal system. Yearly we are placing more responsibility upon them, and we expect them to perform in spite of their increasing burdens. It is certainly within the national interest to help provide state courts with those capabilities needed to meet our expectations. H.R. 6709 would create, as a non-profit corporation, a State Justice Institute, de\u00ad signed to implement a program of national assistance for state court systems. The basic purpose of the bill is improving access to fair and efficient court systems by developing and promoting improved methods of judicial administration. H.R. 6709 fully acknowledges the need to preserve the independence of our state court sys\u00ad tems. It fully recognizes our constitutional and traditional concept of federalism. I believe enactment of this legislation can only enhance and promote constructive co\u00ad ordination between our state and federal court systems. The improvements in judi\u00ad cial administration which would be derived through a State Justice Institute will enable all courts to better \"deliver\" justice. The purposes to be served by H.R. 6709 are not without precedent. Federal funds totaling $325 million have reached our state court systems over the past decade. While that amount is equivalent only to three percent of the total for the aggregate state court budgets, its impact has far exceeded that which would be presumed from the numerical ratio alone. It is my considered judgment that creation of a State Justice Institute is an appro\u00ad priate way in which to assist state courts and simultaneously strengthen the doc\u00ad trines of federalism. In that context, the State Justice Institute has been recom\u00ad mended by the Conference of Chief Justices, the Appellate Judges Conference, and the Council of the American Bar Association's Division on Judicial Administration. The creation of the State Justice Institute will be a major step forward in preserv\u00ad ing and improving strong and effective state court systems. Such systems are essen\u00ad tial. Increasingly, citizens are demanding that the state courts provide the highest quality of justice. At the same time, our Federal government is placing more respon\u00ad sibilities and more burdens on those state courts. I believe they deserve the federal government's cooperation and assistance in meeting those expectations. When I proposed the creation of the National Center for State Courts at the Wil\u00ad liamsburg National Conference on the Judiciary on March 12, 1971,' that was an ex\u00ad pression of my deep-felt conviction that no level of quality in performance of the federal courts would affect the long-deferred maintenance of many of the state court systems. Cordially yours, WARREN E. BURGER. SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, Washington, D.C., December 17, 1982. Hon. ROBERT W. KASTENMEIER, Chairman, Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties, and the Administration of Jus\u00ad tice, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. BEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I have been asked by the Conference of Chief Justices\u2014an organization that I hold in high esteem and of which I am an Honorary Life Member\u2014to reiterate my long-standing support for creation of a State Justice Insti\u00ad tute. I am happy to do so. 73 As you may recall, during the 96th Congress you solicited my views on the need for creation of a non-profit entity to provide technical and financial assistance to improve the administration of justice in State and local courts throughout the United States. On September 22, 1980, I sent you a letter which you kindly incorpo\u00ad rated in the hearing record on the then-pending State Justice Institute proposal. For your convenience, I have appended a copy of that letter. I continue to hold the opin\u00ad ions I expressed at that time. I also have attached a copy of my speech tr> the American Law Institute (Washington, D.C., June 10, 1980), in which I set forth sev\u00ad eral tentative perceptions about Federal and State jurisdiction. Because those per\u00ad ceptions arguably may have become reality, my comments may aid your inquiry. There clearly is a substantial Federal interest in improving access to, the quality of, and public confidence in our State court systems. The State courts, pursuant to the Constitution, share with their Federal counterparts responsibility for enforcing the Constitution and laws made pursuant thereto. State courts routinely handle almost 98 percent of all the judicial business in this country's courts. The expecta\u00ad tions that citizens have of our State courts are essentially the same as those they have for our Federal courts\u2014equal justice rendered in a fair manner, as expedi\u00ad tiously and inexpensively as possible. As aptly observed by a respected and eloquent spokesman for State courts (former Chief Justice Robert J. Sheran, Minnesota), in testimony before your subcommittee: From the perspective of those who supply judicial services, we have in this coun\u00ad try two separate and independent systems\u2014the one Federal, the other State. . . . But from the standpoint of the citizen user, the distinction between Federal and State courts carries no real meaning. He knows that he has a legal problem which must be solved, sometimes by proceedings in court. Whether access to justice is by way of a Federal court or a State court is, to him, immaterial. It is true that the State and Federal court systems have their respective strengths. There are approximately fifteen times the number of State judges of gen\u00ad eral jurisdiction as Federal, and State courts resolve vastly more cases and contro\u00ad versies. Because State courts handle cases for more people and resolve more prob\u00ad lems, those courts are in the front line of the judicial system. Frequently State judges are more flexible and innovative than their lifetime tenured Federal breth\u00ad ren since they derive their authority and jurisdiction from fifty State Constitutions which are not uniform. On the other hand, the two pillars of Article III of the Constitution\u2014life tenure and a bar against dimunition of salary\u2014have allowed the Federal courts to provide a quality forum for certain legislative and constitutionally identified rights and obli\u00ad gations. Where a national interest is identified by Congress, Federal courts apply the law of the land in a generally uniform manner. Moreover, many ideas about court management, procedural reform, and judicial administration have first been developed and tested in the Federal courts and then exported to the State courts and of course the \"traffic\" in ideas and innovations works both ways. As regards ties between the two court systems, I have always felt that the rela\u00ad tionship between them is a complementary one, and not of an adversary nature. Ideas developed in one should, in theory, naturally flow to the other. And for this reason, more than a decade ago I proposed creation of State-Federal Judicial Coun\u00ad cils. Almost every State now has such an entity. I also find much satisfaction in seeds that I planted when I proposed creation of the National Center for State Courts at the Williamsburg National Conference on the Judiciary on March 32, 1971. Today that seed has grown into a mature tree. I recently took a further step and, using my powers as Presiding Officer of the Judicial Conference of the United States, created a Subcommittee on Federal-State Relations. The subcommittee is composed of the following Federal and State judges: Honorable Mary Anne Richey. Chairman (District of Arizona); Honorable Albert W. Barney, Jr. (Chief Justice. Ver\u00ad mont Supreme Court); Honorable George E. Danielson (California Court of Appeals); Honorable S. Hugh Dillin (Southern District of Indiana); Honorable J. Foy Gum (Northern District of Alabama); Honorable James L. Latchum (District of Delaware); Honorable Vincent McKusick (Chief Justice, Maine Supreme Court); Honorabla Theodore McMillian (Eighth Circuit); and Honorable Dallin Oaks (Utah Supreme Court). It is my hope that the new Federal-State Subcommittee will not only serva State and Federal judiciaries but will also satisfy the important function of identify\u00ad ing basic principles of federalism and assessing how best, in light of these principles, jurisdiction should be allocated between State and Federal courts. With these thoughts in mind, let me state that it is my overriding belief that we cannot rest upon our laurels and do nothing in preparation for the future. More, rather than less, needs to be done\u2014especially in the area of improving the State court systems which generally have been undersupported. 74 I turn now to the specifics of the legislative proposals to create a State Justice Institute (see H.R. 2407 and S. 537, as passed by the Senate on August 10, 1982). Since the two bills pending before your subcommittee are virtually identical, I will refer to them interchangeably. The proposed legislation creates a State Justice Institute as a non-profit corpora\u00ad tion, which is given the mandate to assist State courts to strengthen and improve themselves. Through creation of a funding mechanism, a means exists to satisfy the general purpose of the legislation\u2014to improve access to fair, expeditious courts throughout the country at the lowest possible cost. The proposal, in my opinion, is wholly consistent with traditional concepts of federalism and separation of powers. The proposed Institute would have a Board of Directors, composed of representa\u00ad tives of State judiciaries and would provide an important mechanism for establish\u00ad ing priorities. As is proper, the Institute is asked to coordinate with the Federal Ju\u00ad dicial Center, which of course has more than a decade of experience in research, educational, training, and technical assistance. The amount of money authorized to be appropriated is modest indeed, and pales in comparison to what has been done in the past. I agree with the proposal's requirement that any State or local judicial system receiving funds administered through the Institute provide a matching amount equal to twenty-five percent of the total cost of the particular program or project. I also agree with the proposition reflected in the bills that the Institute is not to interfere with the judicial independence of any court, or allow financial as\u00ad sistance to be used for the funding of regular judicial and administrative activities of any State judicial system. It should not be the role of the Federal government\u2014or any entity thereof\u2014merely to pay the bills of necessary components of routine State judicial expenses. The Federal role should be restricted to improving the State courts. I thank you for your support and for the time and effort you have expended in improving this country's judicial machinery, State as well as Federal. I know that we are committed to the same goal\u2014improving the delivery of justice by this coun\u00ad try's justice system. I stand ready to assist in achieving that goal. With warm appre\u00ad ciation for your efforts, I am, Cordially yours, WARREN E. BURGER. Mr. KASTENMEIEB. At this point, I would like to call on the dis\u00ad tinguished Judge Jack Etheridge, who is a member of the Special Committee on Alternative Means of Dispute Resolution, on behalf of the American Bar Association. You are most welcome. TESTIMONY OF HON. JACK P. ETHERIDGE, PROFESSOR OF LAW, EMORY UNIVERSITY, AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION Judge ETHERIDGE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is a pleasure to be here before this committee. I would like to express the apprecia\u00ad tion of the American Bar Association for the opportunity. The president of this association, Mr. Morris Harrell, has asked me to express his personal regards to you and his regrets that he is not here. He had a commitment which simply prohibited his coming. He is very interested in this. Indeed, this bill represents one of his major legislative priorities and he was particularly disap\u00ad pointed not to be able to come. I am quite honored to speak in his stead. May I first of all thank you and the members of your committee and your counsel, Mr. Remington, for your work and concern in this area. It is an extremely important bill and the American Bar Association, by its endorsement by the House of Delegates of the American Bar Association, have, I think, indicated that concern, that interest in this legislation, in the hope that it will be enacted at an early date. The American Bar Association is greatly concerned about the in\u00ad tegrity and the efficiency of the justice system at whatever point it 75 affects the people of this country. It is very conscious of the sub\u00ad stantial caseloads and complex and multiparty litigation that is now afflicting the State courts. So I would like to speak from the perspective not only of one rep\u00ad resenting the American Bar Association, but one who has for a good many years served as a trial judge in a heavy urban court as well. Perhaps that is a perspective that differs a little bit from the perspective of the appellate court judge. To some extent, maybe that is a contribution for the committee during this day. What the State Justice Institute represents, it seems to us, is a promise and a very great possibility that we can develop something here that will initiate quality programs designed to improve the functioning of the State adjudicatory processes. As has often been said, the State courts and State judges deal with over 90 percent of all the matters that need adjudication in our court system in this country. I would like to suggest right away, in response to Congressman Moorhead's point made in a question earlier during this hearing, that as we see it, the strength\u00ad ening of the State judiciary with all that that implies will have an enormous impact on the willingness and ability of the bar of this country, and indeed, the judiciary, to consider the question of di\u00ad versification of its work and other aspects of it that might be con\u00ad sidered to be transferred from the Federal system. Let me just make these points with respect to that. State courts need to be strong and independent. The stronger a State court is, the stronger our whole system of justice is in this country. In addition to that, State courts, as distinct in large part from Federal courts, can experiment and can afford diversification. Indeed, as Justice Frankfurter would often say as he constantly talked about federalism and the need to preserve it, these State courts afford laboratories for experimentation and for trial and error, which the Federal court simply cannot afford. Interestingly enough, a strengthening of the State courts will also afford a degree of uniformity across our country that we think 'is greatly needed. This is a country in which, people move all over; often businesses are in many, if not all the States, and uniformity is an asset that we need to look toward and to encourage. So we see the State Justice Institute as a great promise in assist\u00ad ing in strengthening of the State judiciary. I would like to com\u00ad ment on that by way of illustration in just a moment. Let me say that the American Bar Association supports the bill in all of its aspects. We particularly wish to support the inclusion of six judges as members of the board. We think that the gover\u00ad nance of this board by those who are making the decisions, who are in the courts, who deal not with adjudicative matters, but the ad\u00ad ministrative matters, is very important. We also would wish to suggest that those six judicial members be from various courts, not just from the appellate courts. When we say that, we do not eliminate those who try cases in courts of limit\u00ad ed jurisdiction and courts of general jurisdiction, and of course, ap\u00ad pellate judges as well. We would wish to point out that while the bill provides for the Conference of Chief Justices to submit 14 candidates to the Presi\u00ad dent, we would think that the minutes or the record of this com-76 mittee's deliberations on this bill ought to reflect that the Presi\u00ad dent would not be limited to just those on that list, whether the first list to be submitted or the second one. There are two matters that I would like to comment on to illus\u00ad trate how I think the State judiciary could be strengthened. Of course, these are just illustrative. There are other matters as well, as set forth in the priorities in article 6 of the bill. In particular, I want to focus on the importance of programs to improve alternatives to resolution of disputes, and judicial educa\u00ad tion. It is, I think, axiomatic that a good government must afford to its people practical and fair ways of resolving their disputes; not just one way. I think all of us who have practiced at the bar and who have been at the bench have learned\u2014and if we have not, we certainly should have from experience\u2014that litigation and advoca\u00ad cy often is not the best way to resolve disputes. Sometimes it is the wrong way. As a professor of law, I confess somehow to my guilt, as I teach students, because sometimes the theme of all of our teaching is that disputes ought to be resolved by litigation. That is not the best way and I think we are moving in a direction which suggests that law schools are seeing this, and undertaking to teach lawyers gen\u00ad erally that there are often other and better alternatives in dispute resolution. The fundamental responsibility to provide mechanisms for reso\u00ad lution of disputes can be met with the help of this bill. A major endeavor of the American Bar Association, as you know, is to press for the accomplishment of the development of alternatives in dis\u00ad pute resolution. As the chairman indicated, I am on the committee of alternative means of dispute resolution and thus have a particular interest in the development in this field and wish to comment on it very brief\u00ad ly to illustrate the point. Several years ago, when this committee was first founded, we identified only about three or four dispute resolution centers in the country worthy of the name. Today, there are at least 200, if not more\u2014which are effective and which are having a great impact. I happen to be chairman of the Atlanta Neighborhood Justice Center, which is a very effective one, and which began with a little Federal support for 3 years. Things being relative, that \"little\" was substantial for us because it got us started. Today, that neighborhood justice center receives not a dime of Federal money. It receives assistance from the county commission\u00ad ers, from the city council, from United Way, from our moving about, and training others. It is a federally independent operation. We are very proud of that. It is taking 60 percent of its cases from the local courts and we deal with over 200 mediations a month and we have over 70 mediators to do that. I think the important thing to see here is that we now have a new method of dispute resolution which is afforded to the courts and to the public. It began with Federal help. I tell you without hesitation that there is nothing more that a trial judge would seek to have in resolving disputes than an addi\u00ad tional option in making the judgments. The option of letting, for 77 example, people make up their own minds how to settle their own disputes. It has greatly to do with the public's appreciation of their gov\u00ad ernment as one which will serve them and not master them. I think it has greatly to do with strengthening federalism, saying that the Federal Government is interested in helping to establish that quality of government which is missing when people cannot have access to the courts and not get their disputes resolved. The rapid development in this field is illustrated in another aspect that you might be interested in. That is, two major law schools, including Harvard University and my own, Emory Univer\u00ad sity, are offering courses in dispute resolution. They have been very greatly accepted by the students. Students are eager to under\u00ad take them because they see the bankruptcy of our court system and they see the need for support. The second major point I would like to make to illustrate and indeed to respond to Congressman Moorhead's question earlier about strengthening the system is the support of education and training programs for judges. It is perfectly clear to me that a na\u00ad tional college for the training of judges has a tremendous value for this country. I have taught at the national college for about 10 or 15 years now and I have seen tremendous development and enhancement of the quality of judges around the country. There is, if you please, a network of judges around this country of those who have attended this college, who have learned a great deal about procedural mat\u00ad ters, about the quality of work that should be expected of them. It seems to me that this justice institute could, indeed, have a great impact on the enhancement of national judicial education. It is a sort of a scandal that we are still permitting judges throughout this country to go on the bench and then to serve with\u00ad out even a suggestion of education to enhance the quality of their work. I think the State Justice Institute could have a great impact in that area. I want to also propose that the evaluation of judges' performance is something that needs to be looked at, and it is very difficult to do that in a meaningful way State by State. The testing, the ex\u00ad perimentation, in fact, the evaluation of the evaluations is some\u00ad thing that could be done by the justice institute such as being pro\u00ad posed. The administrative load in our courts is such that judges often feel themselves as traffic cops, not as judges. They often spend half their day managing their calenders. Much of that could be avoided by the improvement and development of technology in the manage\u00ad ment and administration of affairs by work sponsored by the State Justice Institute. In essence, then, as I have tried to suggest by these few exam\u00ad ples, the impact of State courts' rulings has an increasing reso\u00ad nance in other areas of the country. Trial court or a State appel\u00ad late court's rulings these days can very well impact on businesses throughout the country. It often does. Increasingly, it does. Therefore, the enhancement and strengthening of the judiciary in the States could very well have a great impact on the reduction 25-622 0-84-6 78 of work in the Federal courts because there is, and let's face it, there is a lack of confidence in the State judiciary by reason of the fact that until only in recent years have judges been expected to be specially trained and have there been some standards established that could be applied throughout the States. Let me thank you very much for the opportunity to present these thoughts which will be and are expanded in the statement which has been submitted, and to encourage you to continue on with this important direction. I do not think there is any gift a Congressman could give to our country that would exceed his or her efforts to enhance the quality of the judiciary in this country. As we have often heard\u2014and as I have already said and you know quite well\u2014people do not have little disputes. People have huge disputes. In their lives, it is a huge dispute, and when we talk about enhancement of the judici\u00ad ary, what we really want to talk about and think about\u2014I think you can is our Government's ability to deal with that person's or that corporation's dispute in such a way that he or she or it feels that they have obtained from their Government an opportunity to seek justice and to obtain justice that would not otherwise be af\u00ad forded in a country that was not free. Thank you so much for this opportunity. [The statement of Judge Etheridge follows:] 79 AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION \u00ab-- imusnct. XU-IH03/A- 3 STATEMENT OF JUDGE JACK ETHERIDGE MEMBER, SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION ON BEHALF OF AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION BEFORE SUBCOMMITTEE ON COURTS, CIVIL LIBERTIES AND THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSED STATE JUSTICE INSTITUTE ACT OF 1983, H.R.3403 JULY 13, 1983 80 Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee: I am Judge Jack Etheridge of Atlanta, Georgia, and I am a Member of the American Bar Association's Special Committee on Alternative Means of Dispute Resolution. It is my privilege to appear before this subcommittee and to express the Association's support for prompt enactment of the proposed State Justice Insti\u00ad tute Act. The President of the Association, Morris Harrell of Dallas, Texas, had very much hoped to have been able to personally appear before you today. A prior commitment made that impossible, but he has asked that I convey the Association's strong support for enactment of H.it.3403. He also asked that I emphasize the fact that the creation of the prop'osed Institute is one of Mr. Harrell's legislative priorities. We commend you, Mr. Chairman, for your championing of this legislation to assist state court systems, and we are grateful for this opportunity to present the ABA's views from the unique perspective of the state judiciary. The endorsement of H.R.3403 by the American Bar Association's policy-making House of Delegates was wrought after careful consideration by our Board of Governors, based upon a report prepared and submitted by the Association's Judicial Administration Division. As you know, the membership of the American Bar Association has an abiding concern for the integrity and efficiency of the justice system in this nation. We recognize that all of our courts at the state and federal levels are laboring under great pressures which are imposed by heavy case loads, complex and multi-party litigation, and time-consuming techniques of discovery and procedure. These pressures threaten to affect the deliberate and thoughtful quality of adjudication which is expected by the American public. It is increasingly true that trial judges find themselves devoting more time to the administration of their case loads rather than dealing with matters calling for adjudication. Our citizenry expects prompt and just disposition of its disputes in a manner which is reasonable in cost and accessible to all. Yet the institutional and procedural impasse that is frequently seen in the administration of justice makes it increasingly difficult to satisfy these fundamental aspirations of all citizens. We think the proposed establishment of the State Justice Institute reflects these concerns and addresses a great need. 81 The State Justice Institute would have a vital impact upon needed improvements in administration of justice. The proposed Institute, through its funding and contracting authority, could effectively initiate quality programs designed to improve and enhance the functioning of state adjudicatory processes. The State Justice Institute would have the capacity to utilize federal funds in a manner consistent with the principles of the separation of powers and federalism. Such funds would be employed not for basic court services, but rather would be used as the moving force behind the goal of excellence which the public expects from our state court systems. Federal assistance toward this goal is both appropriate and essential in that a distinct and symbiotic relationship exists between the federal and state judicial systems, with the states shouldering an overwhelming share of the nation's judicial burden. We share the expressed concern in the findings of the Task Force of the Conference of Chief Justices that the quality of justice in state courts reflects the quality of justice in the nation as a whole. Since some 90% of all adjudication is borne by the state court systems, it is essential that all resources -- including those of the federal government -- be utilized in seeking relief for state courts. Less, not more, adjudication should be our goal. However, as also determined by the Task Force, the participation of the state courts in the judicial process has increased due to recent congressional legislation, Supreme Court rulings and the diversion of cases to the state courts. In view of these findings, and in order to realistically achieve the desired standards of efficiency, education of judges, and public access to the courts which are requisite to a quality court system, the federal government must actively participate in the process. Previous funding of programs to assist state courts through the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration initiated successful efforts to improve state court management and training. However, the integration of funds available to both the judicial and execu\u00ad tive branches of government has raised serious questions concerning the separation of POWC-J. the judiciary is a separate and inde\u00ad pendent entity and, in fact, many of its problems are distinct from thosp -'- ^ther facets of the justice system. More important, the rfsulting competition between the judicial and executive branches for limited funds has restricted the ability of state courts to effectuate meaningful reforms. This problem has been exacerbated recently with increasing state property tax revenues being spread increasingly thin throughout state governments. This experience has demonstrated the necessity for a specific focus to serve judicial needs. The proposed State Justice Institute would provide the needed, exclusive attention to state judicial improve\u00ad ments . 2 -82 The provisions of this legislation establish an innovative mechanism designed to strengthen the cooperative relationship between the federal government and state courts without breaching important precepts of federalism. Specifically, Section-4 would establish an eleven-member Board of Directors to. set the Insti\u00ad tute's policies pursuant to the statutory direction of Congress. This Board would be appointed by the President and would be com\u00ad posed of six judges, one state court administrator, and four public members. We heartily support the inclusion of six judgeB as members of the Board. Although categories of judges are not specified in the legislation, it is our expectation -- and, we assume, that of the bill's sponsors -- that a cross-section of the judiciary, including trial, appellate and special court judges, will be represented to insure an adequate balance of experience and viewpoint. The judges and state court administrator must be selected by the President from a list of no more than 14 candidates submitted by the Conference of Chief Justices. The Association recognizes that this method of appointment may be subject to constitutional limitations. However, we suggest that the role of state judges in this process is vital and should not be abandoned. We strongly urge the Congress to insure that state judges retain a dynamic part in the implementation of judicial processes on the state level. The experience and resources of these members of the judiciary would be invaluable in planning for achievement of the goals of this legislation. The Association wholeheartedly supports the breadth of acti\u00ad vities enumerated in Section 6 of the legislation as possible subjects of funded inquiry. In particular, we will briefly focus on the importance of programs to improve the alternative resolution of disputes and of judicial education. Governments at all levels have a fundamental responsibility to provide mechanisms for the resolution of disputes, whether criminal or civil. Not all disputes, however, need to be litigated in the traditional mode. Indeed, those who observe our judicial system quickly learn that litigation, whether one \"wins\" or \"loses,\" can be a hardship for all parties. The advice found in the July 1, 1850 notes for a law lecture among the papers of Abraham Lincoln are as true today as they were then: \"Discourage litigation. Persuade your neighbor to compromise whenever you can. Point out to them (sic) how the nominal winner is often the real loser -- in fees, expenses and waste of time. As a peace-maker, the lawyer has a superior opportunity of being a good man.\" - 3 -83 We are therefore especially enthusiastic in voicing support for that aspect of this legislation which supports the testing and evaluation of \"experimental approaches to providing increased citizen access to justice, including processes which reduce the cost of litigating common grievances and alternative techniques and mechanisms for resolving disputes between citizens.\" A major endeavor of the American Bar Association is to press for the accomplishment of this objective. Significant funds and considerable energies have been expended by state courts, the Association and other entities to develope alternative means of dispute resolution. The Special Committee on Alternative Means of Dispute Resolution, Chaired by Ron Olson of California, receives hundreds of inquiries from throughout the country about the establishment of dispute resolution centers. You will be interested to know that there are about 200 such centers now in existence. As a result of the success enjoyed by many of these experiemental centers, a broader access to opportunities for the resolution of disputes now exists. The various methods of resolution which have been devised are now utilized in other areas, e.g. mediation of school and employment disputes. The significant point is that there has been, for a short period, some federal support for dispute resolution centers. One of these, The Neighborhood Justice Center of Atlanta, Inc., a private, non-profit organization supported by the bench and bar of the Atlanta area, began in 1977. Under the aegis of the Department of Justice and the concern of Attorney General Griffin Bell and Assistant Attorney General Daniel Meador, a number of judges, attorneys, court officials and ordinary citizens set out to find viable alternatives to adjudication in resolving disputes among citizens. More than 200 cases are referred to the Center each month for mediation. The mediators are highly qualified and trained volun\u00ad teers. Much has been learned about alternative techniques of resolving disputes, disputes which would otherwise consume much more time in the courts. Although this center no longer receives federal funds, without federal assistance at the outset it might not exist today. Its success, like several others across the country, has been so great that it serves as a model in numerous other cities. During the past two years, several promising programs have demonstrated the diversity which exists in the field. Both the Houston (TX) Neighborhood Justice, Inc., and the Cleveland Police Prosecutor's Mediation Program relieve the prosecutor's offices of hundreds of cases. The Waterbury (CT) Mediation Program is directly sponsored by the court; whereas the nearby New Haven center is sponsored by a neighborhood organization. The Tulsa (OK) Early Settlement Program is beginning to work closely with the police 84 department to receive citizens' complaints early. These are only a few of the locations which have undertaken successful alternative methods of dispute resolution. Each of them in their organizational stage, and in their development, would have greatly benefited from the work proposed to be undertaken by the State Justice insti\u00ad tute. Thus, we can see from the experience of only a few years, in significant part encouraged by limited federal support, that even more justice can be rendered to our citizens through alternatives to traditional modes of dispute resolution. Many groups across the nation have joined the American Bar Association, and the National Conference of State Trial Judges -- a Conference I had the honor to chair -- in supporting and encouraging the development of alternative dispute resolution programs and techniques. Your legislation, Mr. Chairman, which promotes this objective, also recognizes that the Congress ingends to assure the promise of equal protection for all in our legal system. The second major point we wish to address concerns the proposed objectives in Section 6(c), to \"support education and training programs for judges\" and \"to develop and test methods for measuring the performance of judges and courts and to conduct experiments in the use of such measures to improve their functioning.\" There have been dramatic strides in judicial education in this country during the past two decades, before which time virtually none existed. It is an antiquated notion that one may simply don a judicial robe, often equipped with only law school training and limited experience in the practice of law, to become a competent judge. Many states have developed programs of judicial education. Some are excellent, others are not. There is little consistency in the quality of judicial education among the states. On the national level, the National Judicial College has been an outstanding success utilizing volunteer, non-compensated veteran judges as teachers. In the past decade, the College has issued more than twelve thousand certificates to judges from every state in the nation. The impact of their training and the quality of their work, especially with respect to coping with enormous administrative burdens, has been dramatic. In large part, the College has been financed with private funds. While we do not propose a substantial change in funding sources, it-is clear that the investment of federal funds in support of judicial education would have a rewarding return. What exists today in this field is but a portion of that which is needed. Happily, such existing institutions as the College could effectively utilize additional resources to dramatically expand judicial com\u00ad petence without the unnecessary expense of creating new institutions. - 5 -85 The State Justice Institute would thus afford a unique opportunity to bring to the people of this country a better trained judiciary. This educational component can apply as well to the training of non-judicial personnel within the judical system. The nation's courts are at the threshold of vast improvements in records management, electronic reporting, and modern administrative processes, all of which have been the subject of important advances prompted bv the National Center for State Courts. The State Justice Institute could have an extraordinary impact upon the improvement of management and record keeping procedures throughout the country. All courts operate in essentially the same manner, but it is often the use of outmoded methods which stifle efficient operations. Judges' actions impact on all facets of life in America today -- yet insufficient attention has been given to developing improved measures for evaluation of judges' performance. The ABA, through its Section of Criminal Justice, has developed a proposal to produce guidelines for such evaluations. From our initial survey work in the states, we are aware that some experi\u00ad ments are already underway around the country to evaluate formally the performance of judges. Yet most -- such as bar polls -- are methodologically unsound, and have failed to achieve a central purpose of providing reliable data as to on-the-bench performance. We are therefore pleased to see this area identified as a focus for the State Justice Institute. It is an example of the kind of national contribution which the Institute could make towards judicial administration -- yet which no one state can or would likely undertake itself. The impact of a state court's rulings has an increasing resonance in other areas of the country. There is a growing appreciation that procedural, administrative and even substantive innovations and refinements in one state can often be replicated in other states, with a resulting cost-effective use of limited resources. The enhancement of respect for the judiciary where there exists some uniformity of standards and practices is very great indeed. Thus, we support one of the major functions of the Institute, to serve as a clearinghouse for the preparation, pub\u00ad lication and dissemination of information regarding state judicial systems. The resultant studies, data, and demonstration projects could then more efficiently be aggregated and shared with court systems throughout the country. Like good judicial work, much of what is learned in one jurisdiction can have universal application. Here again, we think that common sense and good business and governmental practice dictates enactment of this bill. Finally, we advocate the proposals to support various studies and research projects which will improve court organization and management, investigate the likely causes of court delay in resolving cases and evaluate methods of reducing the costs of litigation. A court system which is responsive to the needs of its citizens must be well ordered and efficient in order to main\u00ad tain the confidence of the public. Mr. Chairman, you are to be commended for your sponsorship of this important legislation. On behalf of the ABA, it has been an honor to be afforded this opportunity to express our support for prompt enactment of the State Justice Institute Act. 6 - - 7 -86 Mr. KASTENMEIER. Thank you, Judge Etheridge, for that presen\u00ad tation and for the work you have done in several fields within the American Bar Association and outside of it. Obviously, it has rel\u00ad evance to us on this committee, since we processed the minor dis\u00ad pute resolution. We are only sorry that it is not funded, but the principle is there. But that does raise a question. You have indicated that the neighborhood justice center in Atlanta, found that while Federal funding was essential in the formative years, it has now been able to get along without Federal funding. Do you foresee a similar possibility for the State Justice Insti\u00ad tute? That is to say, that we might start with some seed money here but eventually either reduce or eliminate Federal funding for the State Justice Institute? Do you think that is possible? Judge ETHERIDGE. I see the role of the State Justice Institute as different from the role of a local dispute resolution center. It would seem to me that the State Justice Institute could have as its great role the gathering of information about the successes, for example, of a neighborhood justice center and sharing that with other areas around the country. I think that in time, the support of the State Justice Institute could be such that it would never have to be in enormous propor\u00ad tions, but there would always have to be that central gathering place of those interested in the universe of problems that afflict State courts. This would be what I think would be a major role of the State Justice Institute. If I may pursue that, the point that I wanted to make with the neighborhood justice center is, by way of illustration, that there must be a beginning with these new devices and this State Justice Institute could, in reviewing what is going on out in the country, assist in the beginning and then local agencies or governments could pick them up. Mr. KASTENMEIER. YOU, of course, referred in the statement to the important educational work of the National Judicial College. We are familiar with that. What would the State Justice Institute's role be? Would it be primarily of helping to underwrite or fund such an institution or an existing institution, or would it go on to encourage the development of new programs or both? Judge ETHERIDGE. I think certainly I would not envision that this Institute would be the principal funder of the National Judicial College. I think that each of the States, to the extent they serve their State judges, should contribute, but I do not think that would be enough. I think this Institute should encourage and to some extent sup\u00ad port the National Judicial College. Just as I think the State Justice Institute could well help States in developing their own judicial programs. They could very well be a catalyst, you see, sharing in\u00ad formation and development and programs to enhance the training of local judges. Mr. KASTENMEIER. Invariably, someone will say, well, since there is already such a thing as the National Center for State Courts, could that not really serve this function; could that not be en-87 hanced in some fashion without creating yet another body which those that are not highly familiar with these programs might just confuse. What is the function of one versus the other? How would you answer that? Judge ETHERIDGE. I would say that the National Center has a very important role to do research in discrete projects and to devel\u00ad op on a contract basis with States if necessary, as they do now, the review of certain processes and procedures, but I do not see it capa\u00ad ble of doing the broad kinds of things that a funded National Jus\u00ad tice Institute could do. Mr. KASTENMEIER. Even with new personnel and new compe\u00ad tence? Judge ETHERIDGE. NO, sir, I do not believe that the National Center for State Courts is the proper vehicle for trying to bring to\u00ad gether throughout this country the kinds of things that I think the State Justice Institute could do. I do not see it as a substitute for it or that this would be a substitute for the National Center. Mr. KASTENMEIER. Thank you. I would like to yield to my col\u00ad league, the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. SAWYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have some reservations about this that the chairman's ques\u00ad tions went to. I do not know that he has the reservations. I have supported it in the past, because the chief justice, then chief justice in my State, was an extremely attractive friend of mine, Mary Coleman, who leaned on me very heavily on this subject. I was suf\u00ad ficiently on the fence that that was all the push I needed. I have the same question I raised last Congress as to why the Na\u00ad tional Center for State Courts, even if it might take some expan\u00ad sion or increase in its role, would not be a better forum to take over this kind of operation than to create a whole new. You know, I still have that question. It would just seem to me that an expansion of an existing operation would make more sense than creating a whole new entity. How do you view that? Judge ETHERIDGE. I think that is a very important question and I am not sure I can answer that adequately for you. It does seem to me that the National Center of State Courts has, and historically has had as its role, a cooperative agreement with some of the States, although not all of them, to come in and do research proj\u00ad ects and so forth. I view this bill as a much richer opportunity, a much broader op\u00ad portunity, than I think the National Center of State Courts could possibly do under its present structure. Mr. SAWYER. I think I understand that, but why would the pref\u00ad erable approach not be to expand or fund additional operations by the National Center for State Courts, rather than create a whole new operation? Judge ETHERIDGE. Well, I do not see this as a whole new\u2014of course, it is a new operation\u2014I do not think the bureaucratic Mr. SAWYER. Well, the tune of $20 or $25 million a year is fairly significant. Judge ETHERIDGE. Sir? Mr. SAWYER. I say, as I recall it, the funding aim is some $20 or $25 million a year, so this is quite a fairly significant operation. 88 Judge ETHERIDGE. Yes; it is significant, there is no doubt about that. I do not see any possibility, though, for the National States Courts to pick up, even if you appropriate that money to the Na\u00ad tional Center, and do the sorts of things that are envisioned in sec\u00ad tion VI of this statute. It seems to me that it is simply not possible under the present government and management of the National Center of State Courts. Mr. SAWYER. Then there is also the college out in Nevada, as I recall, for State judges, new State judges? Judge ETHERIDGE. Yes; National Judicial College. Mr. SAWYER. And that is for training of State judges\u2014this would not overlap with that, either? Judge ETHERIDGE. Oh, no, I think not. I do not envision the Insti\u00ad tute that is proposed as being an Institute for the training of judges. It seems, to me what it could do and do very well would simply be to support and assist the National Judicial College. The National Judicial College, as I am sure you understand, was started by the American Bar Association and is still in some meas\u00ad ure a part of it. It has a unique role. Mr. SAWYER. On the development of things like computerized docket handling and that sort of thing, which I know is being ex\u00ad perimentally tried, at least in some places, do not the State courts kind of get a piggyback on what the Federal courts are doing in , those areas, too? Their problems, other than size, are really no dif\u00ad ferent regarding overcrowded dockets and that sort of thing. Why do we have to duplicate the same efforts, vis-a-vis the State court system, where they certainly have free full access to whatever is being developed in the Federal court system to address those same problems. Judge ETHERiDGErMr: Sawyer, in all due_respect, the difference between management of a Federal court and a State court is like night and day. The management of State courts has to do with huge dockets of criminal matters, divorce, domestic calendars, equity matters. It is an enormous problem in the State courts to deal with that where you have your moneys coming, month by month almost, sometimes annually, sometimes biannually from the county commissioners. There is a huge problem in the State courts with getting enough money to run a court. We have counties in this country which go bankrupt because they have a 6-week trial and they have taken pleas in many times in cases that ought to be tried in order to avoid long trials. Some of our poorer States simply cannot tolerate long trials. So the fiscal problem is so great that it would seem to me a State Jus\u00ad tice Institute, interested and concerned with the management of State judiciary, could afford some really unique and novel opportu\u00ad nities for management that cannot be replicated from the Federal system. There are, of course, technical devices, like the preparation of the record, electronic preparation of the record and things of that sort that we can do. Mr. SAWYER. I know that\u2014I am very familiar with the difference between the docket of State courts and Federal courts, but the Fed\u00ad eral courts also deal with an awful lot of trivia that you normally 89 do not think of. For examples, prisoner habeas corpus petitions, and black lung cases in different areas. They are loaded down with a lot of things, too, and of course, just like the State courts, the great bulk of their criminal cases are taking pleas, really, and sen\u00ad tencing. It just seems to me, the Federal court system is engaged in this kind of research all the time and I just wondered if it was not just going full blast on two fronts. Do not misunderstand me, I am not opposed to this. I am just kind of on the fence. As I say, now with G. Mennon Williams my chief justice instead of Mary Coleman, I am back on the middle of the fence. I congratulate you on your fine university down there. I had one or two younger partners that we recruited out of that Emory Law School many years ago and they are very fine people and very great assets. That is way up north, too. Judge ETHERIDGE. Good, glad to hear that. Mr. SAWYER. Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. KASTENMEIER. Thank you, Judge Etheridge, we appreciate your contribution today. We do depend on the American Bar Asso\u00ad ciation for a great deal of our input on these questions and the Mr. SAWYER. May I interrupt you for just one comment, Mr. Chairman? Mr. KASTENMEIER. Yes. Mr. SAWYER. That is to say I forgot to mention, particularly in light of this witness, that Mary Coleman, in her younger days, was Miss Georgia in the Miss America contest. [Laughter.] I yield back. Mr. KASTENMEIER. Mary Coleman was your chief justice? Mr. SAWYER. She was Miss Georgia. Mr. KASTENMEIER. NO wonder she is so influential with you. [Laughter.] Mr. SAWYER. That is right. Mr. KASTENMEIER. In any event, we appreciate your contribution today and this concludes our hearing on the State Justice Institute Act. Until tomorrow at 10 a.m., when we reconvene on a different issue, the committee will stand adjourned. [Whereupon, at 3:55 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned, to re\u00ad convene at 10 a.m., Thursday, July 14, 1983.] ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS RESOLUTION of the NATIONAL COUNCIL OF JUVENILE AND FAMILY COURT JUDGES on its FEDERAL LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM JUL 2 7 1982 Be it resolved that the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, at its 45th Annual Conference in Portland, Oregon, July 1982, hereby ratifies actions by the President and Legislation Committee since the Mid-Winter Meeting with respect to pending federal legislation and reaffirms its positions with respect to the following: 1. Support of adequate funding and administrative support for the Office of Juvenile Justice for fiscal years '83 and '84 and for the conduct of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program provided for under Title III of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 as amended and reauthorized in 1980. 2. Support for H.R. 421 to establish a select committee on children, youth and families in the House of Representatives. 3. Support for S. 1701, the \"Missing Children's Act'.' 4. Support for implementation and funding as originally envisioned by Congress when it enacted Public Law 96-272, the 1980 Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act. 5. Support for S. 557, the State Justice Institute Act to provide modest federal support for judicial and related training and other state court improvement programs. 6. Support of S. 2411, the Justice Assistance Act of 1982 to provide for the reauthorization of the National Institute of Justice and the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the establishment of a limited program of federal technical assistance and demonstration program programs, and for the coordination and support with the Department of Justice of the Office of Juvenile Justice and related programs. UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED. (91) 92 ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS WASHINGTON, D.C. 20S44 W'LLIp\"^o.F01\"EY September 21, 1982 JOSEPH F. SPANIOL, JR. OEPUTY DIRECTOR Honorable Robert W. Kastenmeier Chairman, Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties and the Administration of Justice House Committee on the Judiciary Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Mr. Chairman: In my capacity as Secretary to the Judicial Conference of the United States, I would like to express the Conference's support for the legislative proposals pending in your subcommittee (see. S. 537 and H.R. 2407) to create a State Justice Institute. The Conference examined the proposals during its March 1982 meeting, and decided to approve the objectives contained therein. Rather than paraphrasing the Conference's findings and recommendations, I would like to share with you the substance of the Conference resolution: S. 537 and H.R. 2407, 97th Congress, are companion measures to aid state and local' governments in strengthening and improv\u00ad ing their justice systems through the creation of a State Justice Institute. The Institute would be a private non\u00ad profit corporation governed by a board of directors consisting of six judges, and one State court administrator appointed by the President from a list of nominees submitted by the Conference of State Chief Justices. In addition the President would appoint four members from the private sector. Although the Institute would be a separate private corporation, its staff would be employees of the United States for various personnel purposes. The Institute would be authorized to accept nonfederal funds and would be granted federal funding for three years. Federal funds, however, could not be used for operational purposes, and matching state funds in a smaller amount that Federal contributions would be required. It was the view of the Cormiittee that the creation of an organization to foster improvements in state court systems is desirable and in the long run would be beneficial to the Federal courts. It therefore recommended the creation of a State Justice Institute, and the Conference approved provisions in S. 537 and H.R. 2407 which would achieve that objective-. 93 Honorable Robert W. Kastenmeier page two The Conference did express reservations about the provisions 1n one section of the bills (see section 3(b)(3))which provides that \"(T]he Institute shall . . . make recommendations concerning the proper allocation of responsibility between the State and Federal court systems . . . .\" The Conference prefers the course of action taken in at least two other bills (see S. 675 and S. 1530) insofar as they guarantee a better ratio of Federal judicial participation than does the State Justice Institute proposal. I am sure that the Conference would not oppose an amendment to strike section 3(b)(3) of the proposed legislation. In addition, the Conference specifically refrained from taking a position on the amount of money to be allocated to the new program. That is a policy question for Congress \u2014 through its authorizing and Appropriations Committees \u2014 and for the executive branch. It is noteworthy, however, that the amount provided in S. 537 and H.R. 2407 is substantially less than that provided in the past. In closing, there clearly is a substantial Federal interest in .preserving and promoting the quality of this country's State courts. Under the Constitution, the State and Federal courts form a partnership to enforce not only the terms of the Constitution but also the laws made pursuant thereto. The Judicial Conference of the United States, and the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, stand ready, as partners, to-work with their State judicial and adminis\u00ad trative counterparts. Acting in concert, much can be done to improve the quality of justice, to reduce unnecessary costs of litigation and to diminish unwarranted delays in reaching final decisions. In this regard, creation of a non-profit entity to provide technical and financial assistance to improve State and local courts will be aneeded step in the right direction. The working alliance between State and Federal courts will be strengthened rather than weakened. Thank you for soliciting the views of the Judicial Conference on. this important legislation.

(10/11/83) Judge Clarice Jobes, P/^sident Justice Sybil Kooper, Secretary 96 NATIONAL ASSOCIAIION OF WOMEN JUDGES What is the Saiional Association of Women Judgei? In October 1979, more than 100 women judges gathered in Los Angeles to share their common experiences and to discuss the status of women in the judiciary. The meeting culminated in the creation of the National Association of Women Judges. These founding members, among them Sandra Day O'Connor, recognized that until women achieve substantial parity with men in the legal profession and in the judiciary, there will be a need for an association devoted to advancing the needs of women judges and to addressing both their professional and their personal concerns. The primary goals of the NAWJ are to: > Promote the administration of justice; . Discuss legal, educational, social, and ethical problems faced by women judges and develop solutions to them; > Increase the number of women judges so that the judiciary more appropriately reflects the role of women in a democratic society; . Educate other judges\u2014male and female\u2014about the problems encountered in the judicial system by female colleagues, attorneys, witnesses, litigants, and jurors. Who joins NAWJ* ; Members of NAWJ come from every level of the judiciary and every ! region of the country. Our fellow members are often at the forefront of ! the legal profession, playing dynamic and influential roles in their i communities. We like to think of ourselves as a group of uncommon ; individuals with a lot in common. When our members speak, they are ' listened to. About the members: We have more than 400 members, representing over half the nation's women judges. > State and federal trial, appellate, and supreme court judges, as well as administrative law judges, belong to the Association. Our membership includes several justices of the Supreme Court of the United States. . Women and men of all political philosophies are welcomed as full-fledged members of NAWJ. What are the advantages of membership in NAWJ? NAWJ acts as a vital antidote to the ills of isolation and stress faced by many women on the bench. We form a strong, supportive network providing women judges with an opportunity to discuss common problems and gain strength, courage, and reassurance, as well as renewed energy and dedication, from our sisters on the bench. NAWJ membership gives you: Annual conferences and periodic district meetings to give members regular opportunities to talk frankly and examine relevant issues through detailed, insightful educational programs. > A newsletter published three times a year to keep you in touch with other members and informed about national developments. * A network of support and influence, which in turn connects you with other significant groups such as the National Conference of Women's Bar Associations. > Contact with women judges in other countries, which results in an invaluable exchange of perspectives and ideas. What are the activities and accomplishments of NAWJ? NAWJ is actively promoting the appointment of more women to the bench. We also develop and support judicial education programs aimed at eliminating gender bias among judges. The programs attempt to focus attention on the devastating impact of divorce on women and children; the demeaning, condescending, or unprofessional ways in which male judges sometimes treat female attorneys, witnesses, and litigants; and the elimination of the appearance of racial and sexual discrimination by judges outside the courtroom. The Association also sponsors programs aimed at making you a better and more efficient judge. Specific NAWJ activities include: . Active participation in the ABA's Judicial Administration Division and careful monitoring of issues particularly relevant to women judges and lawyers; . Tracking of judicial openings to promote aggressively the appointment of more women to the bench; Cosponsorship of the National Conference on Court Technology to be held in Chicago in April 1984; < Participation in the Conference of Chief Justices' Lawyer Competence project; . Encouraging the formation and development of women's bar organizations; . Submitting suggestions to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management for revisions in the federal Civil Service Examination for Administrative Law Judges; Sponsoring programs on how to become an administrative law judge and how to get elected to the state bench; Holding educational sessions for judges on elimination of gender bias, developed with the NOW Legal Defense Education Fund's National Education Program, which have been presented at the National Judicial College in Reno, Nevada, and are also used extensivel) in New York.

Kastenmeier Chairman, Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties and the Administration of Justice 2137 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Chairman Kastenmeier: The Board of Trustees of the Institute for Court Management has authorized me to inform you that the Institute fully supports passage of the State Justice Institute Act. Since its inception in 1970, the Institute has been dedicated to the nation-wide improvement of court management through a broad program of educa\u00ad tion, technical assistance, research and the publication of a professional periodical, The justice System Journal. We believe that the State Justice institute Act is a critically important piece of legislation, while much progress has been achieved in court administration in recent years, much needs to be done, particularly with regard to the training of judges and administra\u00ad tors in the concepts and techniques of sound court management. The funding that would be provided under the State Justice Institute Act would thus aid ICW's mission considerably. Please feel free to include this letter of sup\u00ad port in the hearing record. If we can provide you with any assistance in your efforts to encourage the passage of the State Justice Institute Act, do not hesitate to contact ICM. For your information, enclosed is our 1982 Annual Report. Best wishes for success in the new year. Sincerely, HES/kmh Enclosure THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES Earl F. Morris. Chairman George A.

In the last 10 years, there has been an enormous increase in the use of court administrators in this country, chiefly as a result of the creation of the Institute for Court Management in 1970. There were only a handful of court administrators in the country at that time; now there are hundreds \u2014 mostly in the state systems. We've come to realize that judges can't do both the judging and the management function without some trained help. That is what the Institute for Court Management provided.\" U.S. News and World Report (February 22,1982) Chief Justice Warren E. Burger Chairman Visiting Committee Institute for Court Management Board of Trustees The Institute is a nongovernmental, nonprofit organization sponsored by the American Bar Association, the American Judicature Society, and the Institute of Judicial Administration.

Colorado 80202 (3031 534-3063 101 Message from Earl F. Morris, Chairman, Board of Trustees Over the years, the Institute has worked closely in a variety of projects nol only with our sponsoring organizations \u2014 the American Bar Association, American Judicature Society, and Institute of Judicial Administration \u2014 but also with the National Center for State Courts and the National Judicial College. In 1982, particularly with the latter two organizations, we explored ways of increasing cooperation and possibly affiliating in some formal way. These discussions are continuing and whatever the ultimate outcome, they have already produced a greater sense of understanding among the organizations and a stronger commitment to work together in the future. The Institute's efforts in this regard have been ably led by John J. Corson, Chairman of our Committee on Affiliation. Judge Thomas J. Stovall of the District Court in Houston, Texas, joined the Institute's Board in October, 1982. Judge Stovall replaces Judge Horace VV. Gilmore of the U.S. District Court in Detroit. Judge Gilmore, an original member of the Institute's Board, decided, after twelve years of distinguished service, not to accept reappointment. While we will miss Judge Gilmore's involvement in the work of the Board, we are fortunate to have Judge Stovall join us in view of his exceptionally strong background and experience in court administration. Earl F. Morris, Esq. Chairman, Board of Trustees I am pleased to report that the Institute received increased corporate funding in 1982. In addition, the graduates of the Institute's Court Executive Development Program are to be commended for their generous support. The number of graduate donors increased 123% from 1981 to 1982 and the total amount contributed rose about 25%. In recent years, outside iund raising has become a major concern of the Board because of a sharp reduction in federal funding and the budget constraints under which many state and local court systems are operating. Increased private sector support is therefore necessary if ICM is to carry on its vital mission. Since much of the business of the courts concerns the business of this country, we are confident that the additional support needed will be forthcoming. Our ability to add to our corporate funding base has been aided in particular by one of our newer Board members, George A. Birrell, Vice President and General Counsel of the Mobil Corporation. In terms of support, it is important to acknowledge the continuing interest and backing of Chief Justice Warren E. Burger. Since 1970, when he called for the establishment of the Institute, the Chief Justice has consistently cited in his many public statements the importance of the Institute's work in the effort to improve the administration of the courts. We are most grateful for this support, and we were very pleased that the Chief Justice was able to join the Board of Trustees for lunch at both the March and December 1982 meetings in Washington, D.C. His involvement in our endeavors has been a great source of encouragement to the members of the Board, the staff and the graduates of the Court Executive Development Program. We look forward to continuing our close association with the Chief Justice in the years ahead. 102 Report of The Executive Director Calendar year 1982 was a year of many accomplishments by ICM. During the year, we conducted 31 education and training programs which attracted a total of 1,023 administrators, judges and others involved in the functioning of the justice system. The national character of our work is demonstrated by the fact that ICM programs were presented in all sections of the country and attracted attendees from practically every state. While these statistics demonstrate graphically the strength and vitality of the court management field, what is equally significant is the fact that the results were achieved despite severe national economic conditions. The prolonged recession has forced many states and local jurisdictions to cut budgets. These cuts, combined with a sharply reduced amount of federal support available for court improvement projects, have made it much more difficult for court adminis\u00ad trative personnel to attend education and training sessions. Nevertheless, the average 1982 attendance at ICM programs was higher than in 1981. We are most gratified by these results and feel that they bode well for the future of the young and still developing court management profession. As to research, the Institute's 1982 activities were both broad based and action Harvey E. Solomon Executive Director oriented. Projects were completed which involved work in, or the collection of information from, courts, judges and lawyers in over 30 states. The issues addressed included delay reduction, fines as an alternative to incarceration, the use of telephone conferencing and the organization and management of municipal courts \u2014 the frontline of the justice system. Because an important function of our education program is the dissemination of relevant research findings, the results of these projects were made available to a broad cross-section of court administrators and judges from all over the country. Research and training are closely aligned activities at ICM. Research can help define our training effort while training can serve to multiply the impact of study results. This is one of the unique aspects of the Institute's activities. In 1982, the Institute's Justice System Journal continued its development as a major periodical in the field. The Spring 1982 issue (Vol. 7/1) concerned'the timely topic of \"Court Finances in an Age of Scarcity.\" Other notable articles published during the year dealt with the developing role of the judicial executive, court executives in the federal court system, criminal case processing, grand juries and judicial education. The Journal, which is published with the generous support of the West Publishing Company, serves as a forum for the exchange of ideas and information between prac\u00ad titioners and researchers, and, in this way strengthens our efforts to aid the courts in developing better management systems. The pages that follow describe in greater detail ICM's 1982 programs and activities. All in all, we are proud of what has been accomplished, especially in view of the difficult economic situation con\u00ad fronting non-profit, publicly supported organizations such as the Institute. Despite recent fiscal problems, we are encouraged by the support we have received from the court administration community and we look forward to continuing our service to the state and federal court systems in the drive to improve court operations and administration. 103 Court Executive Development Program In 1982, 22 men and women completed the Court Executive Development Program and became Fellows of the Institute in ceremonies held in the Chamber of the Colorado Supreme Court in Denver. Dean Marshal Kaplan of the Graduate School of Public Affairs of the University of Colorado at Denver was the graduation speaker. The new ICM graduates came from nineteen states and Canada and occupied positions in all levels of the state and federal judiciaries. Since 1970, a total of 380 men and women have completed the program. Graduates serve throughout the state and federal court systems as state court administrators, federal circuit and district executives, trial court administrators, clerks of court and as heads of key court departments. Other ICM graduates teach in universities, serve as court planners, work as consultants, and occupy positions in other justice system agencies. Thus, as a result of the Court Executive Development Program, professional court administrators are in place throughout the country. The challenge now is to use these trained professionals so that they can contribute fully to the drive to improve court management. The program has four parts which are described briefly below: Phase I \u2014 Technology of Modern Court Management. Completion of this phase requires attendance at a minimum of five workshops, each lasting four to six days. The workshops cover various operational aspects of court management. Those pre\u00ad sented in 1982 are listed in the Table on page 9. Attendance at a workshop on caseilow management is the only required course. Phase II \u2014 Management in the Courts and Justice Environment. This is a four-week residential seminar which is academic in nature and emphasizes the applica\u00ad tion of modem management and organization theory to the administration of the courts. Phase m \u2014 Court Study Project Phase III is designed to broaden the participants' practical knowledge of research as a management tool and to enhance their analytical skills. This phase involves completion of an in-depth review of a specific management problem in the participants home jurisdic\u00ad tion and the preparation of a written project report. Phase IV \u2014 Pinal Seminar. Participants whose Phase III reports have been accepted are invited to attend a final one-week session designed to integrate and reinforce previous instruction and experience in the program. A major focus of the seminar is peer review and critique of the project reports. Upon completion of the final seminar, a participant is awarded a certificate recognizing him or her as a Fellow of the Institute for Court Management. The certificate is signed by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, who serves as Chairman of the Institute's visiting Committee of Judges.

These four- to six-day programs are conducted in Colorado and throughout the country. While most sessions concerned operational and managerial issues generally applicable to all courts, special workshops dealing with appellate and limited jurisdiction courts were also conducted. In addition, aside from the Executive Com\u00ad ponent workshop for teams of presiding judges and court administrators, a new course was presented specifically for judges involved directly in administration \u2014 Manage\u00ad ment for Chief and Presiding Judges. The program was conducted in association with the National Center for State Courts. Based on the program evaluations, we expect to include this workshop as a regular feature of ICMs educational offerings. The Institute's workshops and seminars have proven over and over again to be valuable sources of innovation in the courts, with participants returning to their home jurisdictions to implement court management improve\u00ad ments based on what was covered in the sessions. The programs are a vital aspect of the continuing effort to upgrade court administration and make it more effective. Mary Brittain, Staff Associate for Court Management Programs, is in charge of the workshop program and Joan Green, Program Coordinator, is responsible for the administrative arrangements.

On-Site Programs In addition to the workshops and seminars offered for a national audience, the Insti\u00ad tute designs and conducts on-site education programs for states and local juris\u00ad dictions. Pursuant to a contractural agreement, the Institute will present court management training pro\u00ad grams for all levels of court personnel including judges. clerks and court administrators. In 1982 the Institute presented ten on-site education programs. Three of these workshops were conducted pursuant to an agreement with the Los Angeles County Clerk's Office which calls for the Institute to present Phase I of the Court Executive Development Program on-site for Los Angeles and other California court personnel. Additional workshops will be presented in Los Angeles in 1983. Geoff Gallas, M ' i n mm M G w-rmM inistrative Clerk, Mary M. iatefor Court Management B. Green, Program Senior Associate for Court Management Programs, is directing this on-site workshop series. On-site education programs offer courts a significant way to stretch training funds while reaching a large number of people with quality education. The workshops presented in 1982 are summarized below.

For the last several years, five workshops have been held annually. The programs offered in 1982 are listed in the adjacent Table. H. Ted Rubin and Geoff Gallas, Senior Associates at ICM, have co-directed these programs since their inception. Professor Gary Albrecht, a sociologist at the University of Illinois Medical Center in Chicago, has been the third faculty member. Together they bring to the programs a broad and flexible array of teaching skills in juvenile policy, practice, and law; rehabilitation; judicial administration; public administration; organization theory; social science research; management information systems; and policy and decisional science. Increasingly, all ICM juvenile justice seminars have expanded their focus to distinguish more from less serious juvenile justice offenders, and to develop alternative tracks for working with these different groups of youths. All workshops integrate a pre-seminar research assignment performed by participants in their local juvenile courts, seminar lectures and discussions, and an in-seminar planning exercise.

H.Ted Rubfai Senior Associate for Juvenile and Criminal Justice 108 Research and Technical Assistance During 1982, the Institute was engaged in research projects on a wide range of topics including appellate and trial court delay, the adminis\u00ad tration of fines, and the use of telephone conferencing. Con\u00ad cerning the appellate court research, ICM, in collaboration with the Institute of Judicial Administration, completed a study of problems confronting the Pennsylvania Superior Court, an intermediate court of appeal. Basically, the study offered a series of recom\u00ad mendations on how the Court could reduce its backlog and delay problems. On the basis of analysis of the Court's pending caseload and inter\u00ad views with judges, court staff, and members of the bar, the final report suggests a sequence of steps to be followed in alleviating the size and age of the pending caseload. Prior to submission of the final report, a workshop was held in Philadelphia with members of the Court to discuss the report's conclu\u00ad sions and recommendations. Work was also concluded on a New Jersey policy research project, funded in part by the Culpeper Foundation. The project involved a study of Mew Jersey's statewide trial court delay reduction effort and an exploration of problems in municipal court administration. The study was guided by Anthony J. Langdon, Assistant Under Secretary of State in charge of the Criminal Justice Department in the British Home Office, who was on leave of absence from that position during 1982 while he served as an ICM Visiting Senior Associate. Final project reports are to be submitted in early 1983. In addition, the Institute completed a study of court operations for the Supreme Court of the Federated States of Micronesia. The Supreme Court of this emerging nation in the South Pacific, which is administered by the United States under a U.N. Trusteeship, also asked the V i* *- .Jf f /*&>- \\/ * i < t Richard H.

Institute to conduct a court management training session for administrative personnel of the state court systems of Ponape, Truk, Kosrae and Yap. The project was conducted in August 1982 in Kolonia, the capital of the Federated States, on the island of Ponape. Harvey Solomon, ICM s Executive Director, was in charge of the training program while the court study was the responsibility of Maureen Solomon, a special consultant to ICM. The Institute also finished its portion of a national-scope study of fines as a criminal sanction in the United States. Working with the Vera Institute of Justice, ICM staff, under the direction of Barry Mahoney, Assistant Director for Research and Programs, conducted a survey of court administrators in 126 jurisdictions across the country on the use, collection, and enforcement of fines. Although many courts did not use fines frequently for non-traffic offenses, the survey uncovered several courts that imposed fines extensively and managed to collect a high proportion of the amount imposed. Moreover, these jurisdictions were successful in enforcing fines in instances of initial non-payment. Preliminary results of the project were presented at the 1982 Law and Society Meeting in June by ICM and Vera Institute staff members. A final report will be submitted to the National Institute of Justice in earlv 1983. 109 Research Assistant, Mariene Thornton, Senior Researcher, Roger Hanson, and Secretary, Anne Khtredge The field work for the joint ICM/ABA Action Commission to Reduce Court Costs and Delay telephone conferencing project in civil cases was completed in 1982. Roger Hanson, Senior Researcher, and Mariene Thornton, Research Assistant, of the Institutes staff organized the gathering of information which included interviews with over 1,200 attorneys, thirty judges, several law clerks, court reporters, and secretaries in three Colorado district courts (Denver, Boulder, and Alamosa) and the Atlantic Vicinage in New Jersey. The preliminary results are basically threefold: The litigant saves money when his attorney uses the telephone instead of appearing in person at the courthouse. The amount saved per hearing averages $100 with annual aggregate savings, if the pilot projects were implemented state\u00ad wide, of $560,000 in Colorado and $1,300,000 in New Jersey. Most attorneys (80-85%) are satisfied with the new procedure. They see very little difference in their ability to participate in hearings by telephone. Judges do not see the innovation as impairing the quality of the proceedings. This is reflected by an effort of state officials in both Colorado and New Jersey to institutionalize the innovation and introduce it in other trial courts. A parallel project concerning criminal cases was also underway in 1982 in the same courts as the civil study. Although the scope of the criminal project is more limited than the civil one, the initial findings are strikingly similar. Final reports on both projects are to be completed by mid- 1983. The research concerning civil cases is being under\u00ad written by a grant from the National Science Foundation with supplemental funding provided by the Piton Foundation in Denver and the Colorado Bar Foundation. A grant from the National Institute of Justice is supporting the criminal study. Two of the main research projects at ICM \u2014 fine administration and telephone conferencing \u2014 have led to the formulation of new research proposals in related areas which we hope will receive funding in 1983. Professor George Cole at the University of Connecticut, has collaborated with ICM in the development of these proposals. In December 1982, ICM was awarded a contract to conduct a management audit of the Aurora (Colorado) Municipal Court. The Institute will address several issues concerning the cost and management of the Court, ranging from administrative work flow, to plea bargaining, to the possible use of electronic recording of court proceedings. A final report is due at the end of April, 1983. Roger Hanson will serve as the ICM project director. 25-622 0-84-8 no Warren E. Burger Award Each year, to recognize significant contributions to the court administration field, the Institute's Board of Trustees presents the Warren E. Burger Award. Glenn R. Winters, former Executive Director of the American Judicature Society, was the recipient of the 1982 Award. The Award was presented in August during the Annual Meeting of the American Bar Association in San Francisco. Mr. Earl F. Morris, Chairman of the Institute's Board of Trustees, presented the Award. His remarks and those of Mr. Winters follow. Remarks of Earl F. Morris \"The Warren E. Burger Award is presented annually by ICM to an individual who has made a major contribution to the development of court administration. Today we make our ninth award to another person who completely satisfies the Award's criterion. \"Glenn R. Winters is to many of us Mr. American Judicature Society. For 34 years he served as Executive Director of that organization, and through it, left an indelible impact on judicial selection and court organization and management. He conducted Citizens Conferences in some forty states and these conferences were a major factor in the ultimate creation of the office of state court administrator in many of our states. His preeminence as a writer, lecturer and consultant on judicial reform topics and the administration of justice has earned him numerous awards and other forms of recognition from every type of professional organization throughout the United States. \"It is with a deep sense of satisfaction that I today add one more star to his crown as, on behalf of ICM, I present to him the Warren E. Burger Award.\" Remarks of Glenn R. Winters \"After eight years of retirement it is wonderful to be remembered at all, and especially in this very splendid way. In this day of super-sophisticated technology it is difficult to realize that as recently as in the eariy years of my career the great majority of the people who managed the business of the courts were little more than what they all called themselves \u2014 clerks. I remember that in those years one of the actual crusades of the court improvement movement was flat filing \u2014 meaning to put legal documents in the filing cabinet flat instead of folded and tied with a ribbon! \"We have come a long way since then. One important reason for that progress has been the great work of the Institute for Court Management. Another is the brilliant leadership of the great Chief Justice for whom this award is named.

C. 20515 Re: HR. 4145 - State Justice Institute Act First Session of 98th Congress Dear Representative Kastenmeier: The National Judicial College has enthusiastically supported the concept of the State Justice Institute since the inception of the idea several years ago. As recently as the meeting of the NJC Board of Directors in July of 1983, the Board expressed its support. The Board unanimously urged the enactment of the legislation and offered to do what it could to assist the adoption of the Bill by the Congress. The National Judicial College, now celebrating its 20th year of service, enrolls between 1,200 to 1,500 judges each year for its resident sessions. Approximately 40 courses are offered with durations of 1-4 weeks of intensive classroom study and related, discussion periods. Coming from every state, the Commonwealths and the Trust Territories, as well as from foreign nations, the judges and related court personnel study the art and science of judging. General, Graduate and Specialty courses are offered on topics rang/ing from Search & Seizure to Court Management to Family Law and Support Hatters to Alcohol and Drugs. Complementing state judicial training programs, The National Judicial- College provides a nation-wide perspective for the judges so that an exchange of ideas and techniques can occur. The National Judicial College works with the National Center for State Courts and the Institute for Court Management in improving the state court systems. The National Center is primarily involved in research, ICM with court management and the College with judicial education. With well over 90% of all court matters handled'within the state systems, the need for strengthening state courts seems apparent. The three organizations, each urging the creation of the State Justice Institute envisioned in H.R. 4145, are pledged to continued cooperation in carrying out their specific functions.

It is involved with the training and education of general jurisdiction judges, special court judges, non-lawyer judges and also offers courses for state and federal administrative law judges. The only limitations on the accomplishments of the College have been those imposed by financial constraints. The enthusiasm of the judges and the desire to improve their service remains high. The financial assistance that would be made possible through the enactment of the State Justice Institute Act, coupled with other funding, will permit the College to continue and expand its services. Your interest in preserving and strengthening the state court system is extremely encouraging and we would ask that this letter of support for those efforts be made part of the Committee record in this matter. Yours very truly, Ernst John Watts Dean cc: Justice Robert F. Utter 124 National Center for State Courts 300 Newport Avenue Williamsburg, Virginia 23185 (804) 253-2000 December 11, 1983 The Honorable Robert W. Kastenmeier Chairman, Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties and the Administration of Justice 2137 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, D. C. 20515 Dear Mr. Chairman: The Board of Directors of the National Center for State Courts has asked that I convey to you a statement of the Center's continuing support for the State Justice Institute Act, now H.R. 4145 as reported by your Subcommittee. We are pleased that this act is pending for action by the full Judiciary Committee and trust that this committee will approve it soon for action by the House. The National Center provided staff assistance to the Task Force of the Conference of Chief Justices and the Conference of State Court Administrators responsible for the initial drafting of the State Justice Institute Act and has worked with the two Conferences from the beginning in urging its enactment by the Congress. The bill continues to be a high priority and we are pleased and encouraged by the support it has received at the subcommittee level in both the House and Senate. While the Center was not represented at your most recent hearings we have testified in the past and would appreciate it if this letter and the enclosed statements could be added to your hearing record. The statements, by Chief Judge Theodore R. Newman of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, then president of the Center, and Edward B. McConnell, the Center's executive director, are as applicable to H.R. 4145 as they were to the earlier version of the bill they directly addressed. These statements make it clear that there is no conflict or overlap between the role of the Center and the role assigned the Institute by the legislation. Indeed, the Institute would, among other important goals, compliment and promote the efforts of the Center to improve the quality of justice administered by the states. Therefore, we support the speedy enactment of H.R. 4145 and thank you and your subcommittee for your efforts in its behalf. Sincerely yours,,. ] Ralph J. Erickstad President Edward B. McConnell Executive Director 125 United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Jurisprudence and Governmental Relations Hearings on State Justice Institute Act of 1979 November 19, 1979 Statement of Edward B. McConnell, Director National Center for State Courts 300 Newport Avenue Williamsburg, Va. 23185 25-622 0-84-9 126 I am Edward B. McConnell, Director of the National Center for State Courts. I appreciate this opportunity to testify before the United States Senate, Com\u00ad mittee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Jurisprudence and Governmental Relations, with reference to the proposed State Justice Institute Act of 1979. Tersely stated, today in too many courts justice is too long delayed, costs too much, and is sometimes never concluded. Unfortunately this is often so even after the substantial progress that has been made in the last 10 years; much of it with the help of federal funds made available under the Law Enforce\u00ad ment Assistance Act. Much obviously remains to be done if courts are to be readily accessible to all persons at a reasonable cost; if they are to dispose of matters fairly and impartially yet expeditiously; and if the participants and the public are to understand the judicial process and have confidence in it. Many today are inclined to be cynical, particularly about the capabilities of their government and its officials. Yet as one who has worked for and with state government for over 30 years, I have a high regard for public officials. Those that I've known, almost without exception, are conscientious and sincerely interested in providing the public with the service it deserves and demands, but often is unwilling to pay for. From my experience this is true of judges, court administrators, and other court personnel. The main problem is - not their lack of desire to improve; the problem is that all too often they either do not know how to bring about improvement or, if they know, they do not have the resources to put their knowledge into practice. Generally speaking, the technical know-how and the money needed to bring about changes for the better have just not been there. And the flood of new laws, more lawyers, and more people in an increasingly complex, congested and litigious society constantly pressure to change things for the worse. 127 Aided by the expertise, of the National Center for State Courts and other organizations and by supplemental federal funds for research, development and implementation, the state courts in recent years have made a good start: (1) in improving their administrative structure and organization; (2) in developing needed management systems and skills, including the use of modern technology; (3) in utilizing the social science disciplines to study court problems, to devise solutions, and to test out and evaluate those solutions; (4) in developing the information base, or statistics, on the courts, an essential if one is to know what is going on and to be able to do anything about it; and (5) in effectuating the political changes necessary to implement many court improvement programs. Much remains to be done, but we can feel some confidence that the tools are now available to the courts for analyzing problems and ferreting out answers. Many old problems still need solutions, while known solutions still need to be implemented in the nation's courts. Moreover new problems are constantly arising to demand attention, most of them resulting from actions of those outside the courts and many of them by actions of the federal government itself. The justification for the federal government providing finanacial assistance for the state courts is amply set forth in the May 1979 Report of the Conference of Chief Justices Task Force on a State Court Improvement Act, of which Chief Justice Robert F. Utter of the State of Washington was the chairman. The Task Force Report likewise demonstrates the need to have a vehicle which is consistent with the principles of federalism, the separation of powers and the integrity of the judicial branch of government, such as the proposed State Justice Institute, through which to channel federal funds for the improvement of state courts. I am sure that others who have already testified, or will testify before this Subcommittee will give ad quate attention to these important subjects. Accordingly, I should like to concentrate my testimony today on the role that the National Center for State Courts would play in carrying out the purposes of the proposed State Justice Institute Act. 128 The Federal Judicial Center was established by the Congress in 1967 and quickly demonstrated its value to the Federal court system as a resource for research, problem solving and technical advice. It was not surprising, there\u00ad fore, that in 1971 at the first National Conference on the Judiciary it was proposed that a comparable center be created to serve the court systems of the 50 states. The proposal met with universal approval and.in July 1971 the National Center for State Courts was incorporated as a non-profit organization by a committee of the Conference of Chief Justices, chaired by then Chief Justice James S. Holden of Vermont, now a Federal District Court judge. The National Center is controlled by a Council of State Court Representatives, one representative being appointed by the highest court of each state. The Council in turn elects a Board of Directors, comprised of judges from all levels of the state judiciary, to establish policy for and direct the operations of the Center staff. That staff, possessing the wide range of skills and experience needed to address the problems of the state courts, is located at a headquarters office in Williamsburg, Virginia; at regional offices in Massachusetts, Georgia, Minnesota and California; and at project offices in Colorado and Washington, D.C. In the eight years of its existence, the National Center, like its counter\u00ad part the Federal Judicial Center, has become an indispensibl e adjunct of the courts. That this is so is amply demonstrated by repeated action of the Conference of Chief Justices \u2014 an organization, as its name indicates, composed of the highest judicial officer of each of the 50 states. In a,resolution adopted at its annual meeting in 1974, the Conference stated: \"Whereas, the National Center for State Courts .is a court assistance organization governed by the courts of the fifty states, and has rendered valuable assistance in court improvement to various 129 members of the Conference and to the state court systems which they represent;\u2014 Be it resolved as follows: 1. The Law Enforcement Assistance Administration is urged to continue its funding support for the National Center for State Courts so that it can increase its assistance and service to state court systems; and 2. State judicial, legislative and executive branches are called upon to increase state financial support for the Center so that it can increase its assistance to state courts and can remain as an independent organization dedicated to service of state court systems. 3. The special Committee on Federal Funding [of the Conference of Chief Justices] is authorized to develop proposals for long-term federal funding support for the Center to supplement state judicial funding.\" At its annual meeting in 1976, recognizing the increasingly important part the National Center had in efforts to assist state courts to bring about needed improvements, the Conference of Chief Justices designated the National Center as its Secretariat. Since then the National Center has been similarly designated by other groups, until today it serves as Secretariat for eight of the most significant national court organizations. In 1977 at its-annual meeting the Conference of Chief Justices adopted a report (with an implementing recommendation) which stated in part: \"The National Center offers a key mechanism by which federal funds can appropriately be used to assist state courts, providing resources far. beyond the means of any individual state or, under present court budgets, the state court systems collectively. We strongly favor a direct Congressional appropriation towards 130 the support of the National Center for State Courts similar to the support provided for the Federal Judicial Center.\" Attorney Genera] Griffin B. Bell made just such a proposal in his address that year to the Conference. And at its 1979 midyear meeting the Conference of Chief Justices adopted a resolution stating in part: \"Whereas, the National Center was created and is directed by the state courts, and is performing indispensible and continuing functions essential for much needed improvements in the state court systems, ... \"Now, therefore, be it resolved, that the Conference of Chief Justices hereby declares to the Congress and the Administration that the Conference's highest priority [the emphasis is included in the resolution] in the area of LEAA reauthorization and refunding is: 1) That the needs of the National Center especially for funding of its ongoing essential state court support services, and its national and state research and demonstra\u00ad tion programs be recognized by the Congress; 2) That provision for their continuance be provided for by the Congress, and 3) That the Congress clearly express its endorsement of the unique role of the National Center in state court reform and of the need of the National Center to continue its vital role with adequate federal fundingby LEAA or its successor agency at not less than the level it currently receives.\" 131 In keeping with the foregoing statements of the Conference of Chief Justices, the May 1979 Report of the Conference's Task Force on a State Court Improvement Act, which Report was approved by the Conference at its 1979 annual meeting, recommended the enactment by Congress of legislation establishing a State Justice Institute and specifically in\u00ad cluded in the draft legislation attached to the Report provision that the Institute \"shall give priority to grants, cooperative agreements or con\u00ad tracts with: (i) state and local courts and their agencies, and (ii) national non-profit organizations controlled by, operating in conjunction with, and serving the judicial branches of state governments\". The latter designation currently is applicable only to the National Center for State Courts. The legislation recommended in this Report serves as the basis for the State Justice Institute Act of 1979 which is the subject of today's hearing. It should be pointed out that the states have indicated the value they place on the continued existence of the National Center not only by recommend\u00ad ing its support with federal funds, but each of the 50 states have supported the Center with legislatively appropriated funds included as a part of their state judicial budgets. But just as the state court systems themselves have not always received appropriated funds sufficient for their purposes and are in need of federal funding assistance, so the state appropriations for the support of the National Center fall short of being sufficient to maintain its essential services. It is for these reasons that the Conference of Chief Justices has recommended federal funding assistance for the National Center as a priority under its proposed State Justice Institute Act. In this regard, it is important to note that the National Center for State Courts is presently addressing, or has addressed, all of the requirements of 132 strong and effective state courts enumerated in the proposed Act, and has done work for and been of assistance to state courts in all of the subject-matter areas specified in the Act for which the proposed State Justice Institute would be authorized to award grants or to enter into cooperative agreements or contracts. As previously mentioned, the National Center does not work exclusively for the Conference of Chief Justices nor for that matter only for appellate courts. It provides expert services and engages in court improvement projects for appellate and trial courts in every state; for courts at every level of state government fctate, district, circuit, county and municipal); and for courts having all types of subject-matter jurisdiction (civil, criminal, family, juvenile, small claims, traffic, etc.). National Center staff conduct research and demonstration projects and render expert advice on matters ranging from advanced technology, computers and automated information systems; to modern planning,financial and personnel management techniques; to effective means of caseflow or calendar management; to improved procedures for conducting trial and appellate litigation; to the structure, jurisdiction and constitutional authority of state court systems; and to the essential nature and outcomes of dispute resolving processes themselves. Moreover, the National Center, in addition to working directly with the Conference of Chief Justices and its committees, which represent the top judicial leadership of the state judiciaries, also is actively engaged in serving and carrying out significant court improvement projects with the Conference of State Court Administrators; with organizations of trial judges (i.e. the National Conference of Metropolitan Courts), trial court administrators, court clerks and court planners; as well as with groups such as the Committee on the Implementation of Standards of Judicial Administration of the American Bar Association's Judicial Administration Division. 133 I should emphasize here that although the Conference of Chief Justices has designated the National Center for State Courts as its \"highest priority\", and that such a priority is provided for in its proposed legislation, that legislation does not exclude any other organization working in the area of court improvement from receiving support from the State Justice Institute. Indeed, provision for such support, when the objectives of the Act can be better served thereby, are specifically provided for. Again, the National Center is in a position analagous to the Federal Judicial Center. The Federal Judicial Center is the prime agency for providing support for the Federal courts, but it is not the only organization which receives federal funds to carry out projects aimed at improvement of the Federal courts. In summary, there are good reasons why the federal government should be interested in assisting financially in the improvement and maintainance of a high quality of justice as it is administered by the state courts which handle 98.8% of all court litigation. There are good reasons why the proposed State Justice Institute is the best possible vehicle for providing such federal funding assistance for state courts. And, as I have pointed out at some length, there are good reasons why the proposed State Justice Institute Act of 1979 specifically provides a funding priority for the National Center for State Courts \u2014 the only organization created by, controlled by, and devoted exclusively to serving the courts of every state as they struggle to meet the challenges of providing justice in modern day America. With the aid that an adequately funded State Justice Institute would provide for the improvement of state courts throughout the nation, there can be every expectation that the day will be materially accelerated when all persons in all states will have courts readily accessible to them and at costs they can afford; when their disputes will be finally resolved fairly and expeditiously; and when the courts will operate openly and be fully accountable to the public and it in turn will have renewed confidence in the administration of justice. 134 STATEMENT OF CHIEF JUDGE THEODORE R. NEWMAN, JR. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COURT OF APPEALS ON S. 2387 THE STATE JUSTICE INSTITUTE ACT OF 1980 BEFORE THE SENATE JUDICIARY SUBCOMMITTEE ON JURISPRUDENCE AND GOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS MARCH 19, 1980 135 Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: I am pleased to be asked to present my views on the State Justice Institute Act of 1980 for I share the views of the distinguished judges and scholars who have preceeded me as witnesses in these hearings and who see the act as an im\u00ad portant landmark in the history of our federal system and in our continuing quest for a more perfect system of justice. The act proposes a reasoned and balanced approach to the important and complex issues involved in establishing an appropriate federal role in relation to state court systems. Most significantly, it will provide the means for focusing national attention, and the national expectations that implies, on one of our most neglected concerns as a great and diverse nation, the quality of justice administered at the state and local levels. These courts, which now include those in the District of Columbia, handle 98 per cent of the matters which bring our citizens into the judicial process and it is in these courts that the great mass of our citizens make their judge\u00ad ments on the quality of justice our society provides. They are, indeed, the people's courts, and if they are not perceived as providing justice the consequences are severe and endless and include heavy and unnecessary burdens on the federal justice system. Second, the act strikes a delicate but proper balance between functions and responsibilities that are national in nature, and thus appropriately federal, and those which must 136 remain securely in state control. Thus, it is true to the principles of federalism but, equally important, it is true to the doctrine of separation of powers. These are not theoretical or philosophical issues of concern only to judges and legal scholars; they are at the heart of the problems that must be resolved if we are to develop and sustain the national resources and programs that can be the most effective in improv\u00ad ing the judicial institutions and processes which necessarily function under greatly differing circumstances in thousands of locations. The dimensions of our state judicial systems are vast from any. perspective. It is axiomatic that decisions made by them are among the most important affecting the lives of our citizens, few if any of whom escape involvement with the courts at one or more critical points in their lives. Geographically the systems involve the District of Columbia along with 54 states and territories stretching from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands in the South Atlantic northward across the continent to Alaska and then to Guam and American Samoa in the Western Pacific. They include more than 17,000 trial and appellate courts with upwards of 25,000 judges and some 150,000 clerks, administrators and other support personnel. Their costs run into the hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Yet as large and vital as the total system is, it is among the most neglected of government functions in many areas 137 and has been one of the last great enterprises, public or private, to adapt to the modern world. One aspect of the problem, as cited by Edward B. McConnell, director of the National Center for State Courts, is not that the courts have been badly managed or mis-managed, but that they have not been managed at all. Fortunately, this condition is changing, thanks to the work of the National Center, itself only nine years old, and other national organizations which have begun operation in recent years, notably the Institute for Court Management in Denver and the National Judicial College in Reno, Nevada. These highly regarded agencies are not only bringing national perspectives and expectations to bear on the problems of our state and local courts but are providing the absolutely essential national resources needed to help us solve them. I cannot emphasize too much the importance of national resources and perspectives if we are to deal with our problems in the most efficient and effective manner. You know from your own experience in modernizing the judicial system of Alabama, Mr. Chairman, how difficult and tenacious the problems can be, and the critical role that national resources can play in helping to correct them. We want our state courts to be free and independent, of course. We want them to reflect, as they must, what is special in their own historic development and the needs of the people they serve. But they also have much in common, including the underlying obligation to enforce the laws and the Constitution of the United States. This means that we have at bottom only one judicial system, despite 55 separate jurisdictions; 56 if we count the federal. There is then an overwhelming national interest in the quality 138 of justice administered by our state and local courts and, in my view, a national obligation to assist with the kinds of national programs that are needed, but are beyond the resources of individual state court systems, and for which, under our federal system, the national government is the only governmental authority competent to act. I am happy to say it has been acting, although initially by accident and, therefore, in something less than the ideal manner. Congress, as you know, did not specifically include courts in the initial legislation creating the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration in 1969 but it quickly became apparent that the judiciary could not be ignored if there was to be an effective national effort to help state and local governments deal with crime and improve the criminal justice process. However it came about, federal funding through LEAA has been the major source of funds for innovative court reform efforts and for the national organizations sparking this reform at the state and local levels. In the view of one knowledgeable student of court administration LEAA has been \"the single most powerful impetus for improvement in state court systems\" in the past 10 years. Other witnesses have described at length the many problems involved in the present LEAA program as it involves state courts and I will not repeat that discussion here. But I should note 139 that LEAA's discretionary program made it possible for leaders of the nation's judiciary to come together at Williamsburg, Va. in 1971 at the historic First National Conference on the Judiciary. It was this conference that issued the call for creation of a national center serving state courts and, of course, LEAA fund\u00ad ing made it possible for the National Center to begin its work and has helped it progress to the important position it holds today as the primary research and technical assistance arm of the state court systems. It has become a truly national resource filling a vital national role. A brief discussion of only two of the many national scope projects now underway at the Center will illustrate the point. As remarkable as it may seem, there has not been available to scholars, court administrators or government policy makers a single source of reliable data on the opera\u00ad tion of state court systems. No one could say with accuracy how many cases were handled by the states as a whole, what has been the pattern of growth or change in the caseload, and no one could make reliable comparisons, for instance, as to the efficiency of one state system as compared to any other because the data, even when available, were incompatible. Indeed, data from different courts within the same state often have been collected in such a manner as to make impossible comparative analysis of individual court needs or performance. Reliable data, of course, are the first requisite of effective management and essential to such rudimentary tasks 140 as accurate budget projections, assignment of judicial resources, and evaluation of their performance. Such statistics are available to federal courts and provide the basis for effective management by circuit councils and the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, and for research and evaluation by the Federal Judicial Center. Now,thanks to long-range projects underway at the National Center for State Courts in cooperation with the Con\u00ad ference of State Court Administrators, the Center is developing the ongoing capability to gather, analyze, and disseminate reliable statistics on caseload, organization, and operation of state courts. To improve the accuracy and reliability of reported statistical information, the project publishes compre\u00ad hensive annual reports on state court caseloads, which are based on existing state-produced reports, and has developed a State Court Model Annual Beport and a State Court Model Statistical Dictionary. These recommend procedures to follow in developing consistent and useful annual reports and suggest a classifica\u00ad tion structure to use in reporting caseload data. The project also provides answers to information requests and on-site tech- nical assistance to court administrators. Thus, it clearly fills an important national need while providing significant returns in terms of improved management and policy making at the state and local levels. A related National scope effort being conducted in cooperation with the Conference of State Court Administrators 141 is the State Judicial Information Systems project which is developing operational statewide information systems to provide court administrators with timely, accurate, and complete court caseload and resource information. Together with the statistics project this effort will for the first time provide the basis for a uniform system of data that will make it possible for scholars and court administrators and policy makers to analyze the data on a national basis and make accurate comparisons between systems. It will help tell us what works and what doesn't work. During the past year five documents were released including a state-of-the art report on existing or planned information systems in the courts of all 50 states, the District of Columbia and the four territories. A cost-benefit methodology for evaluating information systems, and a long- range plan to guide future development and implementation also were published. In addition, documents were released on the adaptability of related information systems to the needs of judicial information. These included the software of the PROMIS computer system for prosecutors and the Offender-Based Transac\u00ad tion Statistics and Computerized Criminal History data-collec\u00ad tions programs. The project also began work on identifying and documenting information on automated systems, subsystems, or modules that may be transferable from one state to another. This project, which also provides on-site technical assistance and an annual national educational program, will lead to the creation at the Center of a central clearinghouse of technical assistance and information to ensure the long term development and improvement of 25-622 O - 84 - 10 142 information systems in all state courts. It too is filling an important national need that benefits courts throughout the nation. Other examples could be cited at length. There are, for instance, comparable national scope projects dealing with the structure and operation of juvenile courts, state court financing, trial court delay, uses of technology to speed court proceedings and reduce costs, improved jury utilization and management, sentencing guidelines, and alternatives to incarceration. It is clear that the national scope projects are important and are making a major contribution to work essential to improvement of state court systems. But it is the on-site work of the Center's five regional offices that provides the critical nexus that makes it possible to effectively define the problems in need of national attention and to bring national resources to bear on them in the operations of the courts them\u00ad selves . They provide the day-to-day contacts and practical experience that make the Center what it was designed to be, an extension of,and a national resource of, state and local courts. In addition, the Center provides secretariat support to eight (soon to be 10) court organizations including the Conference of Chief Justices and the Conference of State Court Administrators. Its specialized library, research and informa\u00ad tion service, and publications program provide a unique national resource serving all courts and court-related institutions. The National Center, which I am proud to serve as vice-president, is then developing the skills and knowledge 143 necessary to do for the vast and complex system of state courts what the Federal Judicial Center is doing for the 11 circuit and 92 district courts of the federal system. And it is working to bring the same margin of excellence to these systems that is the general rule for the federal courts. The FJC, of course, can deal with problems of the federal courts on a multi-jurisdic- tional basis that is beyond the capacity of individual circuit or district courts. Its national resources and perspective have proven their value even though the federal courts, are part of a single and fully integrated judicial system. The much larger and more complex state court systems obviously require this kind of assistance and coordination and they likewise require it on a continuing basis. In summary the National Center works under the direc\u00ad tion of state court systems to act as a focal point for judicial reform. It serves as a catalyst for setting and implementing standards of fair and expeditious judicial administration and help to determine and disseminate solutions to the problems of state judicial systems. It provides the means for reinvesting in all states and profits gained from judicial advance in any state. It is essential, Mr. Chairman, that the National Center, like the FJC, have secure sources of funding that will permit it to plan and function on a long-term basis and main\u00ad tain a professional staff of the highest quality. 144 In this regard, we are pleased to report that the Center is continuing to develop funding from private and state court sources to implement its program. In 1979, for example, funds from federal sources accounted for only 55.7 per cent of total revenues of $7,153,338. This compares to a federal share of 62.7 per cent in 1978 when revenues totaled $5,662,497. In closing I will note that the National Center for State Courts was established as a non-profit organization be\u00ad cause that is the only structure suited to its role as a nation\u00ad al organization of the state court systems. It is in the nature of our federal system that such an agency could be neither state nor federal. Yet it is obvious that the Center serves both state and national needs. As presently organized, the Center's administration and policy are firmly under control of officials of the state judiciaries. That is essential if it is to be an agency serving state judicial needs. But it is equally clear that the Center serves vital national purposes that merit and require national support. Many of its present national efforts are threatened by uncertain funding from LEAA and are made far less effective because of the short-term annual grant basis on which they are planned and funded. So its work, Mr. Chairman, best illustrates the kinds of programs the State Justice Insti\u00ad tute can be expected to promote under a rational, long-term program reflecting national objectives subject to Congressional input and oversight as well as the needs of the courts as per\u00ad ceived by state and local judiciaries. 145 The State Justice Institute will not only provide a constitutionally correct mechanism for providing federal assist\u00ad ance to state judicial systems but it will do so in a far more efficient and effective manner than the present hodge-podge of uncoordinated programs. I recommend its creation to you as the single most important step the Congress can take to improve the quality of justice in our land. That concludes my prepared remarks. I will be happy to respond to any questions you might have. 146 Conference of State Court Administrators December 10, 1983 President Richard V.

As you will recall, the Conference was the co-sponsor, along with the Conference of Chief Justices, of the Task Force whose studies and report led to the drafting of the legislation. The Act has been at the top of our federal legislative agenda since its inception when we had the honor of testifying in its support in both the House and Senate. We continue to think it the single most helpful step the Congress could take to improve the administration of justice nationally and greatly appreciate the efforts your subcommittee has made to bring It to the attention of the House. Because we did not have an opportunity to testify at your most recent hearings on it we would appreciate it if this current expression of our support, and the enclosed resolution, could be included in the hearing record.

Kleps Professor Maurice Rosenberg (149) 150 REPORT TO THE CONFERENCE OF CHIEF JUSTICES from the TASK FORCE ON A STATE COURT IMPROVEMENT ACT I. Background of Report The work of this Task Force derives from a resolution adopted by the Conference of Chief Justices at its August 1978 meeting. The committee's charge is to recommend innovative changes in the relations between state courts and the federal government and find ways to improve the administration of justice in the several states without sacrifice of the independence of state judicial systems. The authorizing resolution also referred to the need for a study of the allocation of jurisdiction between state and fed\u00ad eral courts, and it was accompanied by two other resolutions that' commented on the basic principles that should guide Congress in any federal effort to improve the administration of justice in the states and on the then-pending legislation designed to -1-151 reorganize the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration. These resolutions, together with one adopted at the same time by the Conference of State Court Administrators, reflect a long-standing concern of state court systems about federal judi\u00ad cial assistance programs, particularly as they are administered by the executive agencies of federal and state governments. That concern developed not only from the experience of other segments of society with the conditions and restrictions that accompany federal assistance, but from the history of the judicial assis\u00ad tance programs of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration since 1968. State courts were concerned, as well, with their ability to meet the expectation of all citizens that justice be available to everyone. This report is designed to state the views of the Task Force on the fundamental issues involved, and it is submitted for the consideration of the Conference of Chief Justices and that of others concerned with state court systems. The report does not See, Statement of Chief Justice James Duke Cameron, Chairman of the Conference of Chief Justices, before the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Criminal Laws and Procedure, August 23, 1978.

That assignment is the specific responsibility of the Conference's Committee on Federal-State Relations under the chairmanship of Chief Justice Robert J. Sheran of Minnesota, who is also a member of this Task Force. If any of the principles recommended in his report can be adapted by this committee for use in the 1979 reauthorization discussions affecting LEAA, that would be desirable but this Task Force report is intended to serve a far broader, long-range purpose. It is hoped that the report will lead to a \"State Court Improvement Act of 1979\" that will be introduced in the next Congress and will furnish a sound basis for the contin\u00ad uing relationships between the federal government and the state court systems. The Task Force has held five meetings since the August reso\u00ad lutions of the Conference of Chief Justices, an organizing meeting in Minneapolis and work sessions in Denver, Chicago, Kansas City, and Washington, D.C. Its work has been supported by a generous grant from West Publishing Company, by donated time from knowledge\u00ad able experts in the field and by staff assistance from the National 4 Center for State Courts. Chief Justice James Duke Cameron of Arizona, the Chairman of the Conference, has served as a member of the committee and has testified concerning its work before a 4 West Publishing Company made a grant of $20,000 in aid of the Task Force's work.

The Federal Interest in the Quality of Justice in the State Courts. The federal government, and the Congress in particular, has a very direct interest in the quality of justice in state courts. This is because: (1) There is at least as much federal interest in the quality of justice as there is, for example, in the quality of health care and in the quality of the educational system. Indeed, the achievement of fair and equal as well as effective justice has always been thought of as an essential characteristic of American society. Whether a high quality of justice is made available to the American people depends largely upon the state courts which handle over 96 percent of the cases filed in any 5 given year in this country. (2) A high degree of coordination is needed between fed\u00ad eral and state courts in the administration of justice because state courts share with federal courts, under the Constitution, 5 A memorandum from Nora Blair of the National Center for State Courts to Francis J. Taillefer, Project Director, and National Courts Statistics Project (dated April 16, 1979 on file at National Center for State Courts) indicates that 98.8 percent of current cases are handled in state courts. See also Sheran and Isaacman, State Cases Belong in State Courts, 12 Creighton L. Rev. 1 (1978); and Meador, The Federal Government and the State Courts, Robert H. Jackson Lecture, National College of the State Judiciary (Oct. 14, 1977): \"Our system is still structured on the basic premise that the state courts are the primary forums for deciding the controversies which arise in the great mass of day-to-day dealings among citizens.\" -5-155 the obligation to enforce the Constitution of the United States and the laws made in pursuance thereof. (3) The achievement of important congressional policy objectives is dependent, to a significant extent, upon the ability of state courts to effectively implement the legislation enacted by the Congress. An increasing amount of regulatory legislation, such as the 55-mile-an-hour speed limit, is left to state admin\u00ad istrative and judicial implementation. (4) The effort to maintain high quality justice in the federal courts has led to an increasing effort to limit the case load of the federal courts by giving increased responsibility to the state courts. \" (5) The congressional desire to achieve prompt justice in the federal courts through the implementation of the Speedy Trial Act of 1974 has resulted in a reduction of the number of criminal and civil cases disposed of in federal court, with a consequent increased criminal and civil case load in the state courts. (6) The decisions of the United States Supreme Court very greatly increased the procedural due process protections which must be afforded in both criminal and civil cases, thus making it increasingly important that state judiciaries are equipped to implement those decisions if the important United States con\u00ad stitutional interests are to be achieved. (1) The Quality of Justice in the Nation is Largely Determined by the Quality of Justice in State Courts. The federal government has an interest in the quality of justice rendered not only by the federal judiciary, but also by -6-156 the state judiciary. In applying the fourteenth amendment of the United States Constitution to the states, the objective has been to preserve those principles \"of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as funda- 6 mental.\" Certainly the quality of \"justice\" concerns the federal government at least as much as does the quality of education and the quality of health care, both of which have received very sub- 7 stantial financial support from the federal government. State educational systems have received support for special programs 8 and in the form of block grants (revenue sharing). State health 6 From the opinion of Mr. Justice Cardozo in Palko v. Con\u00ad necticut, 320 U.S. 319, 58 S. Ct. 149 (1937). Recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court have held that the federal guarantee against being deprived of one's \"liberty\" without \"due process of law\" is, in many instances, dependent upon whether state law recognizes that its citizens have a liberty interest. Thus whether a citizen has a liberty interest in not being trans\u00ad ferred from one correctional or mental health institution to another is dependent upon whether the state recognizes a right not to be transferred without reason. See Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215 (1976); Montagne v. Haymes, 427 U.S. 236 (1976). Thus the \"liberty\" which Americans cherish so much is increasingly depend\u00ad ent upon the states, especially the state courts. 7 See Kastenmeier and Remington, Court Reform and Access to Justice\u2014A Legislative Perspective (to be published in the Harvard Journal on Legislation in June, 1979) in which it is asserted: \"The overall federal interest in fair and equal justice at the State level is analogous to Federal interest in quality health care at the State level.\" 8 There is very substantial federal contribution to the cost of education. For an illustration of the federal interest, see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1221e creating the National Institute of Education: (a)(1) The Congress hereby declares it to be the policy of the United States to provide to every, person an equal opportunity to receive an education of high quality regardless of his race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or social class. Although the American educational system has pursued this objective, it has -7-157 care systems have received massive federal support for research (National Institutes of Health, Communicable Diseases Center) 9 and for building or improving local hospitals and other facilities. not yet attained that objective. Inequalities of opportunity to receive high quality education remain pronounced. To achieve quality will require far more dependable knowledge about the processes of learning and education than now exists or can be expected from pre\u00ad sent research and experimentation in this field. While the direction of the education system remains primarily the responsibility of State and local governments, the Federal Government has a clear responsibility to provide leadership in the conduct and support of scientific in\u00ad quiry into the educational process. See also and 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 351: hereby affirms that library and infor\u00ad mation services adequate to meet the needs of the people of the United States are essential to achieve national goals and to utilize most effectively the Nation's edu\u00ad cational resources and that the Federal Government will cooperate with State and local governments and public and private agencies in assuring optimum provision of such services. . \u00a7 351. Declaration of policy (a) It is the purpose of this chapter to assist the States in the extension and improvement of public library services in areas of the States which are without such services or in which such services are inadequate, and with public library construction, and in the improvement of such other State library services as library services for physically handicapped, institutionalized, and dis\u00ad advantaged persons, in strengthening State library ad\u00ad ministrative agencies, and in promoting interlibrary cooperation among all types of libraries. (b) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to interfere with State and local initiative and responsi\u00ad bility in the conduct of library services. The adminis\u00ad tration of libraries, the selection of personnel and library books and materials, and, insofar as consistent with the purposes of this chapter, the determination of the best uses of the funds provided under this chapter shall be reserved to the States and their local subdivisions. 9 There is, for example, substantial federal contribution to heart and lung research, dental research, child health, arthritis research, eye research, mental health, aging, and cancer research. See generally title 42 of the United States Code. -8- 25-622 O - 84 - 11 158 The fact that the courts in this country are set up as two separate systems\u2014state and federal\u2014does not mean that federal interest is lacking in the quality of justice delivered by state courts, any more than local control of medicine and education inT dicates a lack of federal interest in their quality. The United States Constitution does not require that there be any federal courts other than the Supreme Court. This reflects a belief by the framers of the Constitution that state courts could adequately handle all cases, whether the issues were of primary concern to the states or 10 to the federal government. Federal financial contribution (even though modest in com\u00ad parison with the basic financial support given state courts by state legislatures) can provide a \"margin of excellence\" and thus improve significantly the quality of justice received by citizens who are 11 affected by state courts. 10 Redish and Muench, \"Adjudication of Federal Causes of Action in State Court,\" 75 Mich. L. Rev. 311 n.3 (1976): \"[T]he Madisonian Compromise of article III . . . permitted but did not require the congressional creation of lower federal courts. In reaching this result, the framers assumed that if Congress chose not to create lower federal courts, the state courts could serve as trial forums in federal cases.\" See memorandum from Harry Swegle to the Task Force on State-Federal Relations (October 4, 1978; copy on file at National Center for State Courts) at 12-13: \"The Task Force concept of leg\u00ad islative objectives could be contained in perhaps six to ten state\u00ad ments on the principal needs of state courts.

The supremacy clause of the United States Constitution provides: This constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby; any thing in the constitution or,, laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding. The supremacy clause requires a state judge to consider whether a state statute or regulation is in conflict with the United States Constitution or with a federal statute or regulation which preempts \"an increased emphasis on programs which make courts more responsive to the citizenry.\" See Yankelovich, Skelly; and White, \"The Public Image of Courts: Highlights of a National Survey of the General Public, Judges, Lawyers, and Community Leaders,\" reprinted in State Courts: Blueprint for the Future 5-69 (1978), in which it is said that effi\u00ad ciency in courts is equal, in the public view, to the problem of pollution and the ability of schools to provide a good education and that two-thirds of the public is willing to commit tax dollars to improvement. See also address of Warren E. Burger to the Second National Conference on the Judiciary (March 19, 1978) Williamsburg, Virginia, reprinted in State Courts: Blueprint for the Future 284 (1978), in which the Chief Justice asserts that state courts are closer to the people and can be more innovative than federal courts can be. See also Kastenmeier and Remington, supra, n.7, urging \"creation of a national program of assistance to state courts, pos\u00ad sibly along the lines of an independent legal services corporation.\" 12 United States Constitution Art.

Friendly, Federal Jurisdiction: A General View 90 (1973): \"[W]e also have state courts, whose judges, like those of the federal courts, must take an oath to support the Constitution and were intended to play an important role.\" -10-160 state law. As a result, the federal government has an interest in ensuring that state judges are able adequately to apply the United States Constitution and congressional enactments when called on to do so. 13 Except in habeas corpus cases, lower federal courts do not generally have the power to review the actions of state courts. The only way to review a state court's decision involving a pre- emption question or involving a federal constitutionality question 13 Lower federal courts may review the validity, under the Constitution and laws of the United States, of a state criminal conviction, but only if the person convicted is \"in custody.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. However, the Supreme Court has limited review in Fourth Amendment (search and seizure) cases to the question of whether the state court gave the defendant an opportunity for a full and fair hearing on the constitutional issue. Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465 (1976). In such a situation, the federal court is not permitted to look into the question of whether the state court reached the correct result, and the only possible review of the result is by the United States Supreme Court. Stone v. Powell may represent a judicial trend in the Supreme Court toward restriction of the inquiry in all habeas corpus cases to the sufficiency of process rather than to the correctness of the result reached by a state court. Even if the Supreme Court does not move further in this direction. Congress might. The Department of Justice has drafted and may present to Congress a proposal for reform of habeas corpus: \"By replacing the traditional habeas corpus remedy and focusing federal review on the adequacy of the state hearing rather than correction of the state's determination, this proposal would increase the respect accorded state courts, ease the tension between sovereignties generated by current practice, reintroduce the notion of finality into criminal litigation and avoid the duplicative expenditure of resources which characterize the present system.\" Memorandum on \"Federal Court Review of State Court Convictions and Sentences,\" dated December 7, 1978, United States Department of Justice, Office for Improvements in the Ad\u00ad ministration of Justice. If this trend does continue, whether by judicial or congres\u00ad sional action, it will mean that the federal government will be as dependent on state courts to decide constitutional questions in - criminal cases as it already is in civil cases. [See discussion in text.] -11-161 14 is by appeal or certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. If certiorari is denied, as it is in the vast majority of cases, there is no federal review. And review by appeal is in practice 15 very little different from certiorari. Thus, in the vast majority of civil cases decided by state courts involving a federal consti\u00ad tutional question or one of federal preemption, there is no mean\u00ad ingful review by any federal court, and the federal government is therefore completely dependent upon state judges to implement fun- 16 daraental federal policies. State courts have an obligation to apply federal law in situations which do not involve state law at all. This is true with respect to congressional legislation whenever there is concurrent 14 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257 allows appeal to the Supreme Court if a state court upholds a state statute under constitutional challenge. If the state court invalidates a state statute on federal consti\u00ad tutional grounds, on the other hand, review by the Supreme Court is discretionary (by writ of certiorari). 15 See Comment, \"The Precedential Effect of Summary Affirm\u00ad ances and Dismissals for Want of a Substantial Federal Question by the Supreme Court after Hicks v. Miranda and Mandel v. Bradley.\" 64 Va. I,. Rev. 117 (1978). 16 In a preemption or constitutionality case, a federal court would have jurisdiction to decide the narrow question of whether the state statute was valid if there was over $10,000 in controversy or if the statute dealt with commerce or some other subject for which the $10,000 minimum does not apply. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1337, et seq. The federal court would probably be able to issue only a declaratory judgment, not an injunction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 and \u00a7 2283 (Anti- Injunction Statute). Furthermore, in criminal and \"quasi-criminal\" cases, a federal court is required to abstain from taking jurisdic\u00ad tion if a state case is pending. Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971); Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. 592 (1975). The dissenters in the latter case felt that the decision was \"obviously only the first step toward extending to state civil proceedings generally the holdings of Younger v. Harris. . . .\" 420 U.S. at 613. In any case, even a declaratory judgment cannot be considered a \"review\" of a state court decision. -12-162 17 state and federal jurisdiction: [I]f exclusive jurisdiction be neither express nor implied, the state courts have concurrent jurisdic\u00ad tion whenever, by their own constitution, they are competent to take it. Claflin v. Houseman, 93 U.S. 130, 136 (1876). There are some categories of federal legislation as to which 18 there is exclusive federal jurisdiction. These include bankruptcy, 19 20 patent and copyright cases, federal criminal cases. Securities 17 That state courts could decide strictly federal cases was decided in 1876 in Claflin v. Houseman, 93 U.S. 130 (1876). In two later cases, the Supreme Court held that state courts have an obli\u00ad gation to decide such cases, even if the federal statute is \"penal.\" Mondou v. New York, N.H. S H.R.R., 223 U.S. 1 (1912); Testa v. Katt, 330 U.S. 386 (1947). However, the Court left open the question of whether the state had an obligation to take jurisdiction where the federal policy expressed in the statute was in conflict with state policy: It is conceded that this same type of claim arising under Rhode Island law would be enforced* by that State's courts. . . . Thus the Rhode Island courts have jurisdiction adequate and appropriate under established local law to adjudicate this action. Under these circumstances the State courts are not free to refuse enforcement of petitioners' claim. 330 U.S. at 394. And a state court may be relieved of this obligation if its state legislature withdraws jurisdiction from it for a class of cases which includes federal cases, as long as the jurisdictional statute does not discriminate against federal causes of action or against non- citizens of the state. Douglas v. New York, N.H. & H.R.R., 279 U.S. 377 (1929). 18 See Redish and Muench, Adjudication of Federal Causes of Action in State Court, 75 Mich. L. Rev. 311 (1976); Wright, Law of Federal Courts 26 (1976). 19 Even in patent cases, there can be an involvement of a state court. If the purported holder of a patent brings an action for the agreed upon price under a contractual agreement and the defendant raises the defense of the invalidity of the patent, the issue must be decided by the state court judge. But the \"federal criminal justice system has increasingly left to states the burden of litigation in areas where there is concurrent jurisdiction. Twenty years ago all interstate transportation of stolen automobile cases were prosecuted by the federal govenment. Today, with rare exceptions, the federal prosecuting officials refuse to bring prosecutions under the Dyer Act, preferring to leave the responsibility in the hands of the states. -13-163 21 22 Exchange Act and Natural Gas Act cases, and antitrust cases. A committee of the House of Representatives has recommended that federal courts concentrate on: Adjudicating disputes in traditional federal subject matter areas such as copyright, patent, trademarks, commerce, bankruptcy, antitrust and admiralty; ren\u00ad dering speedy criminal justice for those accused of crimes; protecting the basic civil and constitutional liberties of all citizens; and resolving vital and often recently identified rights (and sometimes rights not yet identified by the legislative branch) which relate to welfare, occupational,safety, the environ\u00ad ment, consumerism, and privacy. Even in situations where federal courts have traditionally been thought to have exclusive jurisdiction, there are efforts to shift part of the burden of litigation to the state courts, either directly 24 or indirectly. With respect to most congressional enactments, federal and 25 state courts have concurrent jurisdiction. As a consequence, the 21 But see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3739, Pub. L. 94-503, Title I, \u00a7 116 (Oct. 15, 1976), appropriating 10 million dollars annually for dis\u00ad tribution to state attorneys general \"to improve the antitrust cap\u00ad abilities of such state.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3739(a). Of the $10,000,000 for prosecution, only $76,000 has been allocated for purposes of assisting the judiciary in adjudication as compared with the balance appropriated for improvement of prosecution. The growth of state antitrust litigation has been substantial. The apparent federal policy is to enable the Department of Justice to concentrate on major mergers or consolidations and leave to the states matters such as a claimed price fixing practice by a group such as real estate agents. 22 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334 (bankruptcy), 28 Cong. 2d Sess. (1978). 24 See notes 16 through 18, supra. 25 See Hart and Wechsler, The Federal Courts and the Federal System 434-438 (2d ed. 1973). -14-164 plaintiff's decision of whether to bring a case in state or fed\u00ad eral court'is probably based on factors such as the perceived \"liberal\" or \"conservative\" tendency of particular state or fed\u00ad eral judges, the location of the two courts, the amount of delay 26 in each of the two courts, and the relative cost of federal or state litigation. If a case is brought in state court and the time limit for removal of a concurrent jurisdiction case to federal court has passed, a state court is as free from supervision or interference by the federal courts in a concurrent jurisdiction case as in the supremacy clause cases already discussed. In other words, the only review is by appeal or certiorari to the Supreme Court. Even the guidance of a federal court declaratory judgment is not available in this situation. Thus many cases which involve rights under 26 See Note, Exclusive Jurisdiction of the Federal Courts in Private Civil Actions, 70 Harv. L. Rev. 509, 517 (1957): \"[E]ven though concurrent jurisdiction enables the plaintiff to choose the court with the least crowded calendar, there tends to be no signif\u00ad icant difference in the extent of congestion between federal and state courts in most areas.\" Although that may have been true in 1957, today most federal district courts have a much longer delay than does the state court which has concurrent jurisdiction. There is an important question also of the relative cost of litigation in federal and state courts. This is an issue now being studied by the United States Department of Justice. In 1957 it could be said that \"expense will probably be roughly equivalent in federal and state courts.\" 70 Harv. L. Rev. 509, 517 (1957). See Aldisert, Judicial Expansion of Federal Jurisdiction: A Federal Judge's Thoughts on Section 1983, Comity and the Federal Caseload, 1973 Law and Social Order 557, in which Judge Aldisert attributes preference for federal courts to the influence of aca\u00ad demics and the media, both of which have assumed that the federal judiciary is superior to the state judiciary, a conclusion which Aldisert asserts not to be the case. In any event there seems in the year 1979 to be a definite trend toward state litigation as preferable to litigation in federal court. -15-165 federal law are decided by state courts with no guidance or review by any federal court. The federal government has, therefore, an interest in having these cases decided by state judges who are fa\u00ad miliar with the law they are applying in such cases and able to apply it correctly. (3) In the Federal-State Partnership in the Delivery of Justice, the Participation of the State Courts Has Been Increased by Recently Enacted Congressional Legislation. Congress frequently imposes ccn ditions on federal spending as an inducement for states to pass legislation or to adopt admin\u00ad istrative rules which will further congressional policy objectives. An early example was a federal credit of 90 percent on an employer's federal unemployment tax if the state created and the employer used 27 a federally approved unemployment insurance plan. Also, under the Clean Air Act: Within nine months after the federal standards were promulgated, each state was required to submit a State Implementation Plan to the agency. The ad\u00ad ministrator then had four months to approve or dis\u00ad approve each state plan according to eight criteria set forth in the Act. ... If a state's plan was See Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548 (1937). Recently, Congress changed the requirements for approval of an unemployment insurance plan. Now state and local public employees must be covered. By using the spending power instead of the com\u00ad merce power to achieve this goal. Congress has apparently side\u00ad stepped the rule of National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833 (1976). See \"Federal Conditions and Federalism Concerns: Constitutionality of the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1976,\" 58 Boston U. L. Rev. 275 (1978). -16-166 found to be in some respect deficient, the adminis\u00ad trator had two more months in which to promulgate regulations for that state. Thus, any clean air legislation passed by the states is undoubtedly heavily influenced by the federal criteria; and litigation arising from state clean air legislation, while not \"federal question\" lit\u00ad igation, clearly implicates important federal concerns. These cases will be primarily decided by state courts. There are many other examples of federally induced state legislation: the 55 m.p.h. speed limit (induced by a condition on 29 the spending of highway money), eligibility standards for aid to families with dependent children (AFDC or welfare), nuclear power 30 plant siting, and school lunch programs. In fact, virtually every federal aid program is subject to some condition, and the condition frequently is that a state pass and enforce legislation or regula\u00ad tions of a type prescribed by Congress or by a federal administrative 28 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1857-1858a (1970). Comment, \"The Clean Air Act: 'Taking a Stick to the States,\"' 25 Cleve. State L. Rev. 371, 374 (1976) 29 The federal interest in the enforcement of the 55 mile per hour speed limit reflects an increasing concern with the national energy problem. To increase the effectiveness of the enforcement program, the federal government has made substantial grants to state enforcement agencies. Inevitably these lead to increased burdens on the state judicial system, but no appropriations are made to cover these costs or to increase the capacity of the state judi- .ciary to implement the federal policy objective. 30 See Lupu, \"Welfare and Federalism: AFDC Eligibility Pol\u00ad icies and the Scope of State Discretion,\" 57 Boston U. L. Rev. 1 (1977); \"Nuclear Power Plant Siting: Additional Reductions in State Authority?\" 28 Gertrude Brick L. Rev. 439 (1975); \"The National School Lunch Act: Statutory Difficulties and the Need for Manda\u00ad tory Gradual Expansion of State Programs,\" 125 U. Pa. L. Rev. 415 (1976). -17-167 agency. Some litigation usually follows, and state courts thus become involved in the achievement of the federal policy which is involved. A federal aid program which has a very direct impact on state courts is the AFDC program, which requires the states to determine the paternity of any child on welfare, usually through paternity litigation, and to attempt to make the father pay sup\u00ad port, usually by a state contempt of court action or a criminal nonsupport prosecution. The failure to do so results in a loss 31 by the state of federal AFDC money. (4) The Maintenance of a High Quality of Justice in Federal Courts Has Led to Increasing Efforts to Divert Cases to State Courts. The high quality of the federal court system must be pre\u00ad served. It has been long evident that this can be done only by giving state courts major responsibility for the enforcement of a great deal of the federal constitutional, statutory, and admin\u00ad istrative law. In 1928 Frankfurter and Landis urged: Liquor violations, illicit dealings in narcotics, thefts of interstate freight and automobiles, schemes to defraud essentially local in their operation but involving a minor use of the mails, these and like offenses have brought to the federal courts a volume of business which, to no small degree, endanger their capacity to dispose of distinctively federal litiga\u00ad tion and to maintain the quality which has heretofore characterized.the United States courts. The burden of vindicating the interests behind this body of recent 31 Rinn and Schulman, \"Child Support and the New Federal Legislation,\" Journal of the Kansas Bar Association 105 (Summer 1977). -18-168 litigation should, on the whole, be assumed by the states. At the least, the expedient of entrusting state courts with the enforcement of federal laws of this nature, like state enforcement of the Fed\u00ad eral Employers' Liability Act, deserves to be thoroughly canvassed. More recently, a report on \"The Needs of the Federal Courts\" said The federal courts, however, now face a crisis of overload, a crisis so serious that it threatens the capacity of the federal system to function as it should. This is not a crisis for the courts alone. It is a crisis for litigants who seek justice, for claims of human rights, for the rule of,law, and it is there\u00ad fore a crisis for the nation. In his address to the 1979 midwinter meeting of the Confer\u00ad ence of State Court Chief Justices, Attorney General Bell said that he has instructed United States Attorneys to meet with state prose\u00ad cutors to see if states will assume additional responsibility for the prosecution of some criminal conduct now prosecuted in federal court. The Attorney General used as an illustration bank robbery, which he urged be handled by the states as they now do other rob\u00ad beries, thus making it possible for the United States Department of Justice to concentrate on matters such as large-scale white- collar crime which, according to the Attorney General, ought to be given high priority by the federal government. The Attorney General 32 Frankfurter and Landis, The Business of the Supreme Court 293 (1928). See also The Needs of the Federal Courts, Report of the Department of Justice Committee on Revision of the Federal Judicial System (January, 1977) at 7: \"Moreover, a powerful judi\u00ad ciary, as Justice Felix Frankfurter once observed, is necessarily a small judiciary.\" See also Hearings on the State of the Judiciary and Access to Justice before the Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties and the Administration of Justice of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977), statement of Judge Shirley Hufstedler at p. 149. 33 The Needs of the Federal Courts, supra, n.32. -19-169 added that he believed it appropriate for the federal government to share the increased financial burden which will be imposed on the states as a result of this latest policy by the Department of Justice. 34 In Stone v. Powell, the Supreme Court of the United States decided that Fourth Amendment issues cannot be raised by federal habeas corpus if the individual involved has had a full and fair hearing in state court. With respect to the resulting increased state court responsibility. Judge Carl McGowan has recently said: The recent judicially created limitations on the circumstances in which that remedy (habeas corpus) may be invoked contemplates that, with few exceptions, state courts are willing and able to afford full pro\u00ad tection for these federal rights. ... To some degree, these developments may contain a self-justifying ele\u00ad ment: to the extent that they create incentives in the improvement of quality of state court processes of decision, the need for federal supervision should decrease. Thus the federal government has, now more than ever, an in\u00ad terest in ensuring that state courts are able to apply the Fourth Amendment in a way which constitutes a \"full and fair hearing\" and thus avoids the necessity of relitigating the Fourth Amendment 36 question in the federal courts. There are other illustrations of the trend toward greater reliance on state courts. 428 U.S. 465 (1976). 35 McGowan, \"Federal Jurisdiction: Legislative and Judicial Change,\" 28 Case Western Reserve L. Rev. 517, 537 (1978). 36 See also Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971); Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. 592 (1975), limiting the authority of the federal courts to intervene in pending criminal or civil cases in state courts. -20-170 One illustration is Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., a defa\u00ad mation case which is said to \"shift the focal point of one aspect of this struggle (between the law of defamation and the first 38 amendment) from the federal to the state courts.\" 39 Also illustrative are Meachum and Montagne, holding that the protections afforded by the federal due process clause are often available only if there is a liberty interest involved which has been created by state law. During the last session of the Congress, a bill passed the House of Representatives which would require an exhaustion of state administrative remedies before bringing a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 raising a conditions-of-confinement issue. The bill, which has again been approved by the House Judiciary Committee 40 in the current session of the Congress, is designed to give major responsibility to the states to dispose of a maximum number of issues 41 rather than relying, initially at least, on the federal courts. Federal jurisdiction in civil diversity cases, probably the most important type of concurrent jurisdiction case, has been se\u00ad verely criticized and may be abolished or limited in the near future. 418 U.S. 323 (1974). 38 Collins and Drushal,\"The Reaction of the State Courts to Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,\" 28 Case Western Reserve L. Rev. 306, 343 (1978). 39 Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215 (1976); Montagne v.

In some instances the trend toward greater reliance upon state courts reflects a judgment that the responsibility is prop\u00ad erly one for state courts because the interests involved are state rather than federal in nature. This is true of the effort to elim- 43 inate federal diversity jurisdiction. In other situations, how\u00ad ever, the issues have heretofore been thought of as federal in nature. This is true, for example, of questions of the meaning of the fourth amendment to the United States Constitution and also of the meaning of the \"liberty\" protected by the federal due process clause. The consequence is a greatly increased federal interest in the quality and quantity of the work of the state courts as a con\u00ad sequence of the increased responsibility of state courts to safeguard fundamental constitutional rights and liberties of the citizens of this country. (5) The Federal Speedy Trial Act Has Diverted Criminal and Civil Cases to State Courts. 44 The total impact of the new federal Speedy Trial Act will 42 See The Needs of the Federal Courts, supra, n.29 at 13-15. A bill to abolish diversity jurisdiction passed the House but failed in the Senate during the past session. It is almost certain that the same proposal will be reintroduced in both the House and Senate during the current session. See Statement of Robert J. Sheran, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Minnesota, Before the Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties and the Administration of Justice on Diversity Jurisdiction and Related Problems (March 1, 1969). See also Sheran and Isaacman, \"State Cases Belong in State Courts,\" 12 Creighton L. Rev. 1 (1978). 43 See Sheran and Isaacman,\"State Cases Belong in State Courts, 12 Creighton L. Rev. 1 (1978). 44 18 U.S.C. 3161 et seq. -22-172 not be known until it is fully implemented on July 1, 1979. How\u00ad ever, already reliable indications are that the existence of the Speedy Trial Act will contribute to the trend toward greater re\u00ad liance on the state courts for the adjudication of criminal cases and also, in all likelihood, civil cases. With respect to criminal cases, the number filed in federal 45 courts has decreased since the passage of the Speedy Trial Act. Whether this results from the Speedy Trial Act or from a change in prosecution policy is less clear. Both the Attorney General of the United States and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investi\u00ad gation have indicated a purpose to concentrate on white collar crime, interstate crime, organized crime, and domestic surveillance of foreign activities, leaving the prosecution of crimes such as bank 46 robbery to the states. The Attorney General has stated that he believes that the Speedy Trial Act will jeopardize 5,000 pending criminal cases when the act goes into effect on July 1, 1979. To the extent that this is accurate, it will inevitably put additional pressure on federal ID See Report, Speedy Trial Act of 1974 (Administrative Office, U.S. Courts, September 30, 1978). 46 See Report to the Congress, Comptroller General of the U.S., U.S. Attorneys Do Not Prosecute Many Suspected Violators of Federal Laws (February 27, 1978). The report indicates that 7 of 11 complaints are declined for prosecution and of the declinations 28% which could have been prosecuted federally are referred to the states for prosecution or to a federal agency for administrative action. (See p. 7.) As an illustration of the change in federal priorities, there were 4,888 federal Dyer Act prosecutions in 1967 and only 1,591 in 1975, a reduction of 67.5%. (See p. 15.) -23-173 prosecutors to rely increasingly upon state prosecution in order to alleviate the pressure on the federal prosecution and judicial systems. The effort to comply with the requirements of the Speedy Trial Act also results in an inability of federal courts to give prompt attention to pending civil cases. In some federal districts, all of the time of all of the judges has been devoted to reducing the backlog of criminal cases. This will inevitably produce an incentive to bring the civil cases in state rather than federal court. A member of the Florida Supreme Court, in an address to the midwinter Conference of State Court Chief Justices, said that the backlog in the federal district courts in Florida has resulted in all federal wage and hour litigation being brought in the Florida state courts. (6) An Increased Responsibility Has Been Placed on State Court Procedures by the United States Supreme Court. During the past several' decades, decisions of the United States Supreme Court have greatly increased the procedural due 47 48 process protections guaranteed to citizens in criminal, civil, The impact of federal procedural due process requirements on state criminal procedures has been very substantial. For example, the requirements for taking a valid guilty plea have increased greatly, making it important that state courts develop adequate guilty plea procedures and that state court judges be better informed than for\u00ad merly was necessary with respect to the procedural requirements for taking a valid guilty plea. 48 There are increased procedural requirements in the field of civil litigation. For example, in Fuentes v. Florida, 407 U.S. 67 (1972), the Court held that where state law creates a property interest the citizen cannot be deprived of that property interest with\u00ad out notice, a hearing, and the other procedural safeguards of the federal due process clause. And in Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970), the Court held that state welfare benefits cannot be cancelled without a hearing and other protections afforded by federal due process. -24- 25-622 0-84-12 174 49 50 Juvenile, and mental health proceedings. The consequence has been to increase the procedural complexity of state court litiga\u00ad tion requiring the development of new, more adequate, and more efficient procedures and requiring also a much more intensive pro- 51 gram of continuing education for members of the state court judiciary. Indicative of the tremendous impact of decisions of the Supreme Court is the following statement of Mr. Justice Brennan: In recent years, however, another variety of federal law\u2014that fundamental law protecting all of us from the use of governmental powers in ways in\u00ad consistent with American conceptions of human liberty\u2014 has dramatically altered the grist of the state courts. Over the past two decades, decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States have returned to the fun\u00ad damental promises wrought by the blood of those, who fought our War between the States, promises which were thereafter embodied in our fourteenth amendment\u2014 that the citizens of. all our states are also and no less citizens of our United States, that this birthright guarantees our federal constitutional liberties against encroachment by governmental action at any level of our federal system, and that each of us is entitled to due 49 The leading such case in the juvenile field is In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1 (1967). Illustrative is Lessard 1976). The Lessard case held that the State of Wisconsin must, in order to civilly commit a person as mentally ill: give notice of the factual basis for commitment; hold a hearing within forty-eight hours of initial detention and a later full com\u00ad mitment hearing; base commitment on a finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, of danger to self or others; afford counsel, the privilege against self-incrimination, and other procedural safeguards required in criminal proceedings. As a result, there is increased need for carefully worked out state commitment procedures and improved judi\u00ad cial education to ensure adequate implementation of the new, more complex procedures. 51 Some of these have been mandated within the past several years by the highest courts of the state. See, e.g., Vermont Rules of Criminal Procedure. See also the registration statistics for the National Judicial College and other such organizations. -25-175 process of law and the equal protection of the laws from our state governments no less than from our na\u00ad tional one. Although courts do not today substitute their personal economic beliefs for the judgments of our democratically elected legislatures. Supreme Court decisions under the fourteenth amendment have signif\u00ad icantly affected virtually every other area, civil and criminal, of state action. And while these decisions have been accompanied by the enforcement of federal rights by federal courts, they have significantly altered the work of state court judges as well. This is both necessary and desirable under our federal system\u2014state courts no less than federal are and ought to be the guardians of our liberties. . . . Every believer in our concept of federalism, and I am a devout believer, must salute this development in our state courts. . . . . . . [T]he very premise of the cases that fore\u00ad close federal remedies constitutes a clear call to state courts to step into the breach. With the fed\u00ad eral locus of our double protections weakened, our liberties cannot survive if the states betray the trust the Court has put in them. And if that trust is, for the Court, strong enough to override the risk that some states may not live up to it, how much more strongly should we trust state courts whose manifest purpose is to expand constitutional protections. With federal scrutiny diminished, state courts must respond by increasing their own. 52 Brennan, \"State Constitutions and the Protection of Indi\u00ad vidual Rights,\" 90 Harv. L. Rev. 489, 490-91, 502-03 (1977). -26-176 in. Fundamental Principles in Designing Federal Support for State Judicial Systems The development of federal financial support for state court systems is a phenomenon of the past decade. The origin of the concept that federal funding should be provided to aid state courts can be traced to the 1967 Report of the President's Com- 53 mission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice. In that report, it will be noted, the overwhelming emphasis is on the nation's crime problem and on the inability of the states to discharge their obligations to society in a field that the report conceded to be local in nature. Although the Commission envisioned a federal support program for the states \"on which several hundred million dollars annually could be profitably spent over the next decade,\" the only specific court programs that were highlighted dealt with the education and training of judges, court administra\u00ad tors and other support personnel. The basic recommendations af\u00ad fecting court systems dealt with the need for the states them\u00ad selves to reorganize their judicial systems and to upgrade their 54 procedures. The 1967 Report's primary emphasis on federal assistance to the states was in the areas of law enforcement and corrections, 53 \"The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society,\" Report by the. President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, Washington, D.C. (1967). 54 Id., pp. 284-286, 296-297. -27-177 and the administration of the program was therefore to be placed in the United States Department of Justice. It is worth noting in this regard that the Federal courts had long since extricated themselves from the administrative services of the Department of Justice on the principle that the independence of the federal 55 judicial system demanded it. This emphasis on police and cor\u00ad rectional problems was carried over into the congressional delib\u00ad erations that resulted in the 1968 Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, the statute under which the Law Enforcement Assist\u00ad ance Administration (LEAA) has provided some ?6.6 billion in 56 assistance to the states over the period from 1969 to 1978. Court programs were not specifically provided for in the original LEAA enactment at all, despite the obvious fact that courts play an essential role in the operation of any criminal justice system. Chandler, H. P., \"Some Major Advances in the Federal Ju\u00ad dicial System, 1922 - 1947,\" 31 Federal Rules Decisions 307, 517. The principle of judicial independence was a cornerstone for the 1939 act creating the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. 56 See, \"Federal Law Enforcement Assistance: Alternative Approaches,\" Congressional Budget Office (April, 1978), p. 34. Other federal sources of assistance to state courts are outlined in \"Alternative Sources for Financial and Technical Assistance for State Court Systems,\" National Center for State Courts (Northeastern Reg. Off. 1977). They include: traffic court grants from the National Highway Safety Administration, grants under the Department of Labor's CETA program, capital im\u00ad provement grants under the Department of Commerce's Economic De\u00ad velopment Administration, grants under the Department of HEW*s National Institutes, personnel development grants under the Inter\u00ad governmental Personnel Act (U.S. Civil Service Commission), re\u00ad search grants from the National Science Foundation, etc. -28-178 By administrative interpretation, and later by congressional enactment, the role of state courts was finally recognized in the program of federal support for improved administration of criminal justice in the states. Judicial programs have remained a minor part of the federal effort, however, and the figure generally agreed upon is that about 5 percent of the LEAA funds have been used for 57 the improvement of state court systems. Notwithstanding the limited nature of federal financial assistance to state courts over the decade, this LEAA experience has been characterized as a \"most radical and novel development\" that raises fundamental issues concerning the on-going relationship between the federal and state governments insofar as the nation's judicial systems are concerned. Those issues include: The effect of federal funding on the indepen\u00ad dence of state judiciaries; the possibility of federal restrictions, conditions and standards being applied to state courts; the design\u00ad ing of acceptable means for providing funds to national organiza\u00ad tions that support state judicial systems; and the problems arising out of a bureaucratic federal administration of the program through the U. S. Department of Justice. Given the persuasive reasons that have been stated for This figure is limited to court programs specifically, excluding programs designed for prosecutors, defenders and general law reform. See, Haynes, et al., supra note 3 at pp. 20-26; Kleps, supra note 3 at p. 4 and at pp. 88-89. 58 Meador, \"Are we Heading for a Merger of Federal and State Courts,\" Judges' Journal (Vol. 17, No. 2) Amer. Bar Assn., Chicago (1978) pp. 9, 48-49. -29-179 federal financial support to state court systems, how can state goals best be achieved in such a program? The LEAA experience to date has led some states to conclude that the price of federal support is too great, that the results achieved through federal grants do not justify the effort required to obtain them. Others would rewrite the LEAA program entirely in order to establish a wholly new scheme for the delivery of federal dollars to the state judiciaries. Most states, however, would support building on the LEAA experience to fashion a more workable program that can accom\u00ad modate both state needs and national commitments, a program-that will create a balance of state goals and federal funding. The past decade of state court experience with LEAA, of course, is the prin\u00ad cipal basis upon which such a future program should be designed. It has been pointed out that no serious thought was given to the inclusion of state courts in the original authorizing legislation for LEAA. More than that, the bureaucratic system designed for implementation of the LEAA program would disturb even those who are the least concerned about judicial independence. Whether viewed in terms of the block grant programs administered through the states or the discretionary grant program run from Washington, the need for judicial competition with executive agen\u00ad cies in the LEAA programs has created practical and policy problems <= 59 of immense proportions. 59 See, Irving, et al., supra note 3 at p. 11: \"Concern about the erosion of the independent and equal status of the judiciary as an equal branch of government under the present LEAA administrative structure is reaching crisis proportions.\" -30-180 The LEAA program for block grants to the states was required to be administered by state planning agencies designated or estab\u00ad lished by the Governors of the states. Insofar as state courts are concerned, the successes and failures of this program are often traceable directly to the degree of cooperation from, or the representation of judicial agencies on, these executive branch state planning agencies. Reports from those states having strong judicial representation on'the state planning agencies reflect general satisfaction with the quality of the funding support accorded judicial projects. Other states experienced paper representation rather than having a real voice in the program, and still others had no voice at all. The availability of federal dollars for state court improvement often became more promise than reality and the price of competition, compromise and concensus has become too great for some. Indeed, even in those states where the judicial leadership has exercised its power effectively, there arose a growing concern about the propriety of an executive branch agency dictating the goals to be attained by a state's judicial agencies. The lumping together of \"police, courts and corrections\" into one large mix called a \"criminal justice system\" was disturbing to most judges, court administrators and others having responsibil\u00ad ity for judicial administration. At the same time, the LEAA funding of the past decade took* place during the emergence of strong organizational and administra\u00ad tive activity aimed at state court system improvement. The simpli\u00ad fication of trial and appellate court structures and procedures. -31-181 the creation of supporting policy and administrative agencies within the judiciary and the employment of professional court executive officers were phenomena of the years preceding and during the LEAA period. These reform activities were often impaired by executive rules and regulations emanating from Washington and from state houses across the country. Concern has been expressed that the federal controls inherent in the LEAA program could seriously jeopardize not only judicial independence within staes but independent state action as well. The experience of the states with the LEAA-sponsored \"standards and goals\" project was but one 60 example giving rise to such concern. Aside from the problems generated by federal executive activity, the day-to-day interaction of judges and court adminis\u00ad trators with others in the criminal justice community gave addi\u00ad tional cause for concern. The ambiguity surrounding LEAA's purposes and the focusing of its attention on increasing expendi\u00ad tures at the local level tended to undermine state court adminis\u00ad tration despite the many laudable advances made in state court systems with federal funds. Judicial input in the planning and National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, Washington, D.C. (1973). The commission published seven volumes, including the one on \"Courts.\" See, Meador, supra note 26 at p. 49: \"Only a modest imagi\u00ad nation is needed to foresee the development of federal standards for state courts in order for them to be eligible for federal appropriations. . . It would be strange indeed for the state judiciaries to be subject to greater federal authority than are the federal courts. Yet that prospect is not far-fetched and may indeed already be happening under present funding arrangements.\" -32-182 use of federal funds at both state and local levels tended to be minimal. Not until the provision for state judicial planning committees in the 1976 LEAA reauthorization legislation was clear congressional recognition given to the role of state court systems in the planning of LEAA programs. But even the emergence of this recognition was accompanied by confusion and controversy surrounding the inclusion of prosecutors and defenders in the LEAA concept of 61 state judicial planning committees. Nevertheless, with the development of such committees, and with their power to pass judgment on judicial funding decisions at both state and local levels, there appeared for the first time some hope for an informed and coordinated approach to LEAA expenditures for judicial system improvement. Cutting a wide swath across the state block grant programs,' the LEAA discretionary grant program administered from Washington tended to undercut any coordinated programs at the state and local levels under the block grants. A local court unable to fund its program with either local or state funds under the block grant See Opinion of LEAA General Counsel (July 24, 1978), reprinted in the 1978 Annual Report of the California Judicial Planning Committee, Attachment S. p.3. This opinion, and similar opinions to other states, finally accepted the definition of \"court projects\" as excluding prosecutorial and defense services, thus ending a long controversy on the point. This problem carried over from the LEAA decision to include with \"courts\" the functions of prosecutors, defenders and law reform. The problems arising from this classification decision have been noted in many of the reports that have analyzed court problems in connection with the present LEAA structure. See Haynes, et al., supra, n.3 at pages 3, 14-15 and Irving, n.3 Funding\"). -33-183 funding system could by-pass state guidelines by obtaining direct federal funding from Washington. This kind of activity was often known only after the fact by those most responsible for state judicial system management. There was, in fact, virtually no state judicial system input in the use of discretionary funds administered from Washington. This condition often tended to destroy the effectiveness of a state's judicial planning process and it was sometimes counterproductive to the attainment of priority goals sought to be achieved by state judicial systems. The LEAA funding programs have also been used to implement federal policies unconnected with the mandate and purpose of the LEAA program. The ability of federal executive officers to attach conditions to the receipt of federal monies has sometimes been used to achieve goals not specifically set forth in the LEAA statute. The \"standards and goals\" project has already been mentioned, and other examples exist. One is found in the LEAA regulations governing computerized-criminal history information systems in the states. The operating requirements and the security and privacy regulations are specifically tied to the 62 acceptance of federal grants for information systems. Despite all of LEAA's operating and policy problems, it is 62 LEAA Regulations Governing Criminal Justice Information Systems (40 Fed. Reg. 22114 (1975); 28 Code of Fed. Regs. Sec. 20.20 (a)). The regulations purported to apply retrospectively, to juris\u00ad dictions that had previously accepted federal grants for information systems. In its comprehensive report on LEAA the 20th Century Fund noted that both the standards and goals project and the computerized crime information system project were spontaneously generated from Washington by LEAA officials. See 20th Century Fund, \"Law Enforce\u00ad ment: The Federal Role,\"New York (1976), pp. 67, 73-85. -34-184 abundantly clear that substantial benefits have been experienced by many state court systems through the use of federal funds. Structural and organizational changes have taken place in a number of states as a result of funding by LEAA, and demonstration grants have been successful in many instances. Educational programs, including the establishment of judicial colleges in several states, have been widely praised throughout the country as 63 have a number of technical assistance and research grants. One commentator has concluded that \"any review of the past 10 years must conclude that LEAA has been the single most powerful impetus for improvement in state court systems.\" From this decade of LEAA experience certain elements can be identified as essential in the development of any future program for support to state court systems. Foremost among them is the need for a clear congressional statute recognizing the separation of powers principle in the functioning of state governments and the independence of state judiciaries in the exercise of their judicial powers. This action alone would create a more favorable climate for the exercise of the judiciaries' proper role in planning for expenditures in state court systems amidst the competing executive branch interests. Federal recognition of the For a professional criticism of LEAA's research programs, see. National Academy of Sciences, \"Understanding Crime: An Evaluation of the National Institute of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice,\" Washington, D.C. (1977). Kleps, supra note 3 at pages 91-92. -35-185 separate and independent nature of state judicial systems would do much to allay fears of executive branch control at federal, state and local levels of government. Whether associated with the block grant program or the discretionary funding program, recognition of this independence seems to be absolutely essential for any really successful program of future federal assistance to state court 64 systems. 64 An example of the kind of legislative finding that recognizes judicial independence as a fundamental consideration in this field is found in the California Legislature's creation of a judicial planning committee in 1973. (Stats. 1973, Ch. 1047.) \u00a713830. Membership Appointed by Judicial Council Legislature's Findings. There is hereby created in state government a Judicial Criminal Justice Planning Committee of seven members. The Judicial Council shall appoint the members1 of the committee who shall hold office at its pleasure. In this respect the Legislature finds as follows: (a) The California court system has a con\u00ad stitutionally established independence under the judicial and separation of power classes of the State Constitution. (b) The California court system has a state\u00ad wide structure created under the Constitution, state statutes and state court rules, and the Judicial Council of California is the constitutionally established state agency having responsibility for the operation of that structure. (c) The California court system will be directly affected by the criminal justice planning that will be done under this title and by the federal grants that will be made to implement that planning. (d) For effective planning and implementa\u00ad tion of court projects it is essential that the executive Office of Criminal Justice Planning have the advice and assistance of a state judicial system planning committee. -36-186 A second essential ingredient in future federal programs should build upon _the favorable experience of state judicial planning committees under the existing LEAA statute. A logical next step in designing a successful federal funding program would be the creation and staffing of a national institution whose members, or at least a substantial majority of whose members, can represent state court systems. The delegation of responsibil\u00ad ity to such a body for the planning of federal expenditures to support state court improvement could be achieved with minimal disruption to the established concepts of federal-state relations, and it would have the maximum;support from the state judicial /-systems which LEAA has never enjoyed.. Such a knowledgeable and representative group should be charged with responsibility for establishing priorities and policies for -the distribution of federal-funds to state court systems based upon their established judicial needs and priorities rather than upon assumed needs as perceived by federal or state executive agencies. The establishment of this agency would command the respect of both federal authorities and state recipients. A clearly identified national responsibility for such an agency would avoid duplicative and overlapping efforts by the various federal funding sources and would provide a clear route of access for state court planners. Coordination of the agency's efforts with existing judicial planning committees in the states would afford a maximum opportunity for judicial input and, most importantly, would create' judicial responsibility for the effectivemess and success of any - . -37-187 state court improvement programs supported by federal funds. A third principle which should be incorporated into any future program of federal assistance to state courts is that the nationwide organizations that support state judicial systems should be principal recipients for the continuing allocation of the federal funds that are awarded on a discretionary basis directly from Washington. The- national organizations mentioned hereafter are only illustrative of the kind of national effort that could well be supported by the continuing allocation of federal funds. The educational programs that are represented by the National Judicial College at Reno and by the Institute for Court Management at Denver represent a category that is extremely important to state judicial systems and that has proved to be of great value. The general support activities of the National Center for State Courts, with its regional offices, technical assistance teams and research programs, illustrate the kind of professional assistance that is desperately needed by many states. Similarly, the technical assistance programs of the American University in Washington have proved to be very helpful in a number of instances. Finally, the research activities of the Institute for Judicial Administration in New York, of the American Judicature Society in Chicago and of a number of academic institu\u00ad tions that have worked in the judicial field deserve continuing support. The discretionary federal funds that are available for the purposes outlined are administered at the present time by a -38-188 variety of bureaus and subdivisions of the federal government. Funds are allocated for priorities that are separately established by these federal agencies, thus making a coordinated approach on a high priority basis almost impossible. The national judicial planning agency referred to above could easily be given the responsibility for establishing priorities in the use of the available funds and for approving the national programs that are organized by federal funding agencies to aid state judicial systems. If this principle were incorporated into future federal programs for assistance to state courts, increased coordination in the application of federal funds would follow, proven Drograms would be spread to more and more states and a more effective use of federal funds would result. -39-189 The Challenge for the Future for State and Local Court Systems The challenge to state and local courts is to do justice and maintain the confidence and respect of the public. To achieve these goals requires continuing improvement and growth. Attention must be given to the role of courts in the community as well as the internal organization and procedures of the courts. I. Courts and the Community Historically, a vast gulf has been perceived by observers between courts and the communities they serve. To bridge this gulf, many legitimate community concerns need to be addressed, without sacrificing the values of equity and efficiency that have guided twentieth century judicial reforms. Effective access to adjudica\u00ad tive forums is essential for all disputants. The provision of ade\u00ad quate representation for all is necessary to insure that courts are not used as instruments of oppression. The existence of lang\u00ad uage, geographic, psychological, and procedural barriers to justice must be recognized and alleviated. Courts must be sensitive to the problem of compelling members of the public to submit matters to courts which do not involve real disputes requiring exercise of judicial discretion. Less expensive and complex processes must be provided to maintain the availability of courts for their funda\u00ad mental dispute resolution functions. Courts should insure that community service as a witness is comprehensible and convenient. The judiciary should insure that victims, especially the elderly, the very young, and those subjected to violence are treated with special care and concern throughout the process. Jury service should be spread widely among -40- 25-622 0 - 84 - 13 190 community members and burdens of such service minimized as much as possible. The justice system should experiment extensively, where appropriate, with the use of lay community members as dispute resolvers in mediation, arbitration and adjudication and with other forms of dispute resolution. The present court system should evolve into a comprehensive justice system by incorporating non\u00ad judicial modes of dispute resolution as they prove successful. Our system of government relies upon independent judges free to render decisions in accord with their own hearing of the facts and reading of the law. On the other hand, the judiciary recog\u00ad nizes that the lay community has a proper role in issues such as personnel selection, courthouse location, and judicial demeanor. To accomplish the delicate balancing between the needs for judi\u00ad cial independence and community involvement, courts may increase the areas where community input is sought without allowing intru\u00ad sion on the judicial decision-making process. Citizen participation in selection and discipline of judges is appropriate. Citizen input should be received on judicial councils, court advisory committees and other policy making and administrative organs of the court system. The justice system should have effective programs for detecting and responding to citizen grievances and community perceptions about its performance and policy-making authority. Administrative control should be delegated to lay community rep\u00ad resentatives for at least some nonprofessional dispute resolution forums. -41-191 II. Internal Organization and Procedures of the Courts Courts are complex institutions which vary in size and scope from a single judge sitting without staff to a conglomerate of judges operating in specialized divisions supported by thousands of employees. Internal organization of courts includes everything from the relationship of the courtroom clerk and the trial judge to the budgetary processes through which a state or national court system presents its need to various appropriating authorities. Internal procedures include those which affect the final disposition of cases and those which only support the litigative function. There a number of challenges to state courts to achieve the most effective internal organization and procedures. Administrative structures of state court systems need to be examined to find the most effective way of providing leadership, administrative assist\u00ad ance, and responsiveness. Judicial selection, training, motivation and discipline are critical subjects for effective court operation. Processes must be devised whereby the best personnel can be selected for the ju\u00ad dicial system. Continuing judicial education is essential for judges at all levels. All personnel benefit from a strong train\u00ad ing program, not just in sharpening technical skills and sensi\u00ad tivity but in building motivation and reducing a sense of isolation. Management of trial courts is particularly important for the control of pace and flow of cases through the system. Early management of cases is helpful so that disposition is prompt and efforts to settle are sincere. In criminal matters speedy trial -42-192 rules require courts to establish an effective information system and to monitor each case effectively. In order to meet require\u00ad ments of efficiency in both civil and criminal fields, courts must adhere to some performance standards set at either a local or state\u00ad wide level and use goals and objectives as well as measurement tools to meet these performance expectations. Judges must maintain effec\u00ad tive communication with the bar. The effective processing of cases requires an effective level of communication with lawyers who rep\u00ad resent the litigants. In the final analysis, the judiciary must recognize it is their responsibility to establish and maintain effective organiza\u00ad tion and procedures. If courts accept this responsibility and have the resources to carry out the responsibility, the respect for and integrity of the judiciary can be maintained. These are but a few of the challenges facing the state judi\u00ad ciary if they are to remain an effective instrument for the de\u00ad livery of justice to the American people. State courts can serve a unique role as the incubator for ideas and innovations for the entire justice system. The independence of these courts insures a large measure of diversity and there is both pride and strength in that diversity. To maintain the independence and diversity of state courts there are limitations on uses to which federal funds would be put by state and local courts. Funds made available to state courts under this act would be used to supplement the basic court systems of the several states. They would not be used to support basic -43-193 court services. They would provide for a measure of excellence by supporting research, technical assistance, test and demonstra\u00ad tion of new techniques, education and training, and dissemination of new knowledge to the state courts. Funds would not be used to employ more judges or to fund essential, on-going judicial func\u00ad tions. Funds would not be used for construction of court facili\u00ad ties, except to the extent of remodeling existing facilities to. demonstrate a new architectural or technological technique, or to provide temporary facilities for new personnel involved in demon\u00ad stration or experimental programs. Funds would also not be used for payment of judicial salaries. These limitations are required by considerations of federalism and separation of powers as well as considerations of most cost effective uses to which limited federal funds should be put to bring about improvement in, rather than maintenance of, state court functions. -44-194 v State Justice System Improvement Act Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled. That this Act may be cited as the \"State Justice Institute Act of 1979\". It is the declared policy of the Congress to aid state and local governments in strengthening and improving their judicial systems in a manner consistent with the doctrine of separation of powers and federalism.

Sec. 102(a) There is hereby established in the District of Columbia a private nonprofit corporation, which shall be known as the State Justice Institute, whose purpose it shall be to further the develop\u00ad ment and adoption of improved judicial administration in the State -45-195 Courts of the United States. (b) Findings.\u2014The Congress finds and declares that\u2014 (1) the quality of justice in the nation is largely determined by the quality of justice in state courts; (2) state courts share with the federal courts the general responsibility for enforcing \"the requirements of the constitution and laws of the United States; (3) in the federal-state partnership in the delivery of justice, the participation of the state courts has been increased by recently enacted federal legislation; (4) the maintenance of a high quality of justice in federal courts has led to increasing efforts to divert cases to state courts; (5) the federal Speedy Trial Act has diverted criminal and civil cases to state courts; (6) an increased responsibility has been placed on state court procedures by the Supreme Court of the United States; (7) consequently, there is a significant federal interest in maintaining strong and effective state courts; and (8) it is appropriate for the federal government to provide financial and technical support to the state courts to insure that they remain strong and effective in a time when their workloads are increasing as a result of federal government decisions and policies; and (9) strong and effective state courts are those which produce understandable, accessible, efficient and equal justice, which requires (a) qualified judges and other court personnel; (b) high quality education and training programs for judges and other court personnel; -46-196 (c) appropriate use of qualified nonjudicial personnel to assist in court decision-making; (d) structures and procedures which promote communication and coordination among courts and judges and maximize the efficient use of judges and court facilities; (e) resource planning and budgeting which allocate current resources in the most efficient manner and forecast accurately the future demands for judicial services; (f) sound management systems which take advantage of modern business technology including records management procedures, data processing, comprehensive personnel systems, efficient juror utiliza\u00ad tion and management techniques, and advanced means for recording and transcribing court proceedings; (g) uniform statistics on caseloads, dispositions, and other court-related processes on which to base day-to-day management de\u00ad cisions and long-range planning; (h) sound procedures for managing caseloads and individual cases to assure the speediest possible resolution of litigation; (i) programs which encourage the highest performance of judges and courts, to improve their functioning, to insure their accountability to the public, and to facilitate the removal of personnel who are unable to perform satisfactorily; (j) rules and procedures which reconcile the requirements of due process with the need for speedy and certain justice; (k) responsiveness to the need for citizen involvement in court activities, through educating citizens to the role and func\u00ad tions of courts, and improving the treatment of witnesses, victims. .-47-197 and jurors; (1) innovative programs for increasing access to justice by reducing the cost of litigation and by developing alternative mechanisms and techniques for resolving disputes. (c) Purpose.\u2014It is the purpose of the Congress in this Act to assist the state courts, and organizations which support them, to attain the above requirements for strong and effective courts, through a funding mechanism consistent with the doctrines of separation of powers and federalism, and thereby to improve the quality of justice available to the American people. To achieve this purpose the Institute shall (1) direct a national program of assistance designed to assure each person ready access to a fair and effective system of justice by providing funds to (A) State courts; and (B) National organizations which support and are supported by State courts. (2) The Institute should not duplicate functions adequately performed by existing organizations and should promote on the part of agencies of state judicial administration, responsibility for success and effectiveness of state courts improvement programs supported by federal funding; (3) foster coordination arid cooperation with the federal judiciary in areas of mutual concern; (4) make recommendations concerning the proper allocation of responsibility between the state and federal court systems; -48-198 (5) promote recognition of the importance of the separation of powers doctrine to an independent judiciary; and (6) encourage education for the judiciary through national and state organizations, including universities.

We understand that Congressional proposals are still in the planning stage and anticipate the opportunity to study and comment on such proposals as they are sub\u00ad mitted in draft form, as well as subsequent proposals from the Department of Jus\u00ad tice. We support the thrust of the major recommendations in the present Study Group report and in particular applaud (1) the new focus on improving and strengthening the elements of the criminal justice system rather than on \"reducing crime\"; (2) the emphasis on improved management and coordination functions; and (3) the call for assured minimum funding of court programs. Long-term needs Our principal concern is that the report, with its focus on criminal justice, does not address the long-term needs of our nation's total justice system. From the judi\u00ad ciary's point-of-view, criminal and civil justice are inextricable. A broader focus is needed if state courts are to play their fundamental role in improving the adminis\u00ad tration of justice, including the criminal and juvenile components, and assume a major share of the burden now carried by the federal courts. We do not feel that the Study Group has adequately addressed the need for a basic national policy on improvement of the total justice system and creation of the appropriate national institutions and procedures by which this policy could be im\u00ad plemented in keeping with the constitutional principles of federalism and the sepa\u00ad ration of powers. There is a proper federal role in improving the justice system but it must be per\u00ad formed in a manner that respects the identity and independence of state courts. Federal funding must be looked upon as a means of adding strength to state judicial systems and not as a method of extending federal authority to areas better managed on a state or local basis. The Department of Justice should not be in a position, through funding decisions or otherwise, to set policies for the independent judicia\u00ad ries of the states. Discretionary funds The Conference of Chief Justices also is concerned that the Study Group report does not provide for continuation of national discretionary funds to provide basic support for the National Center for State Courts, the research and development arm of the state judiciaries, and for other court support organizations such as the Na\u00ad tional College of the State Judiciary. In our view, these institutions are essential to implementation of national policy for improving the administration of justice. The National Center offers a key mechanism by which federal funds can appropriately be used to assist state courts, providing resources far beyond the means of any indi\u00ad vidual state or, under present court budgets, the state court system collectively. We strongly favor a direct Congressional appropriation towards the support of the Na\u00ad tional Center for State Courts similar to the support provided for the Federal Judi\u00ad cial Center.' 2. The National Center for State Courts, as previously indicated, should receive a direct Congressional appropriation toward its support similar to the financial sup\u00ad port provided for the Federal Judicial Center. 3. The highest court or judicial council should have state-wide authority for initi\u00ad ating, administering, and disbursing funds for programs improving the state-wide justice system. All of the Study Group's arguments against fragmentation and for coordination support this approach as do all recent studies which point to the state- level approach as providing the highest potential for demonstrable improvements in state judicial systems. 4. Federal funds should not be limited to programs for criminal and juvenile jus\u00ad tice in such a manner as to prevent needed improvement in the overall judicial system. This will be even more true if state courts are to assume a larger share of the caseload relative to the federal judicial system. 1 Such a suggestion was made by Attorney General Griffin Bell in his address to the Confer\u00adence of Chief Justices on August 2, 1977, at their annual meeting in Minneapolis, Minnesota. 217 5. Provision should be made for a national discretionary fund to help support na\u00ad tional institutions of the state court systems that cannot be adequately funded through state judicial budgets. 6. Further action should be taken to enunciate a federal policy for improvement of the nation's total justice system and plan for creation of an appropriate agency to direct and fund programs to implement that policy. Specific comments on study group report In light of these recommendations the Conference of Chief Justices has these com\u00ad ments on the general and specific recommendations of the Study Group: General policy recommendations 1. We support the refocusing of the national research and development role with the understanding that this role, as it applies to the courts, not be limited to the criminal justice system but address the needs of each state's total justice system. 2. We support the shift to direct formula grants with the understanding that the judiciary receive approximately 30 percent of each state's allocation; that the judi\u00ad ciary's funds be administered at the state level, and that state courts themselves, rather than the Department of Justice, determine which programs best suit their individual needs. 3. We agree that there should be a \"Federal government response to the problems of crime and the inefficient administration of justice.\" Federal funding under LEAA has been essential to the development of effective national institutions of the state judiciaries as well as major programs for improvement of individual state court sys\u00ad tems. Funds for these programs would not have been provided by state or local legis\u00ad lative bodies which traditionally have kept the judiciary on limited budgets. Nor is their reason to believe that such funds will be made available in the future from state and local sources. 4. We agree that the two major strategic components of the federal role should involve (1) development of national priorities and program strategies and (2) the pro\u00ad vision of financial assistance to state and local governments. But we believe these statements should be amended to recognize the unique position of the judicial branch in the criminal justice system, i.e., to recognize the courts as a separate branch of government and not a ' component\" of the criminal justice system. Implic\u00ad it in this recognition would be other elements of the CCJ positions stated above, i.e., the need for involvement of non-federal organizations such as the National Center for State Courts in formulating and implementing national policy for improvement of the entire justice system; the need for allocating a specific percentage of funds to the judicial branch; and the need for state level direction of court program develop\u00ad ment and funding. 5. We concur in general with the Study Group's basic conclusions on the unwieldi- ness of present LEAA administrative procedures. However, we support state-wide planning for the judicial branch of goverment which, as noted above, differs signifi\u00ad cantly in its administrative and rule-making structure from executive branch crimi\u00ad nal justice agencies. The problems encountered by the present executive branch state planning agencies develop principally out of factors involving differing state and local responsibilities for the criminal justice system and the separation of powers. These considerations either do not apply or do not apply with equal force in comprehensive planning for the judicial branch alone which can and should plan for all judicial branch programs, not just those financed by federal funds. Specific recommendations 1. We approve recommendation No. 1 as conditioned by the CCJ policy statements above, i.e., principally to ask that the refocused national research and development role recognize the needs of the total justice system, not just criminal justice, and that state court systems and their national organization play a major role in initiat\u00ad ing programs for the judicial branch. 2. We qualifiedly approve Recommendation No. 2 provided the demonstration pro\u00ad grams for the judicial branch are not limited to those initiated or developed at the federal level which could amount to federally established priorities for the needs of individual states court systems. (We qualifiedly approve the Study Group's second general recommendation (page 14) on direct assistance to state nd local governments provided, as previously indicated, that the assistance include an appropriate share for judicial systems, administered at the state level, and that national program models are not limited to those developed by the federal funding agency.) 3. We approve Recommendation No. 3 but with the understanding that federal financial assistance to the judicial branch not be limited to criminal justice pro\u00ad grams but support improvement of the entire state court system. 218 4. We qualifiedly approve Resolution No. 1, provided an equitable percentage of the funds is received by the state court systems. 5. We qualifiedly approve Resolution No. 5 provided Federal funding assistance, for reasons previously entitled, is not limited to nationally developed programs or even to locally developed programs warranting national implementation. Many lo\u00ad cally developed programs may not warrant national implementation but offer excel\u00ad lent solutions to local problems, since all states are not alike, nor even are all courts within a state alike and amendable to only national solutions. 6. We strongly approve Recommendation No. 6. The courts must have an identi\u00ad fied or minimum level of support that adequately recognizes their needs, their key role in the state justice system, and the fact that they are generally inadequately funded by the states. 7. We approve Recommendation No. 7 with the understanding that the responsi\u00ad ble judicial authorities provide coordination with the judicial branch and between the judicial branch and executive branch criminal justice agencies. 8. We qualifiedly approve Recommendation No. 8 because we perceive difficulties in arriving at an effective definition of what constitutes an \"improvement\" and how the provision is to be monitored or enforced. Such procedures could make this option satisfactory or undesirable. Certainly the judicial branch, rather than the general government, should be responsible for determining what constitutes an \"im\u00ad provement\" in programs of the judicial branch. CONCLUSION We believe the Study Group should give further consideration to the formulation of a federal policy on improvement of the total justice system and to the structuring of federal programs that can achieve national goals for the delivery of justice while being true to the constitutional principles of federalism and the separation of powers. The preservation and the independence of state judicial systems are the impera\u00ad tives which must undergird all joint efforts to deal with problems relating to the effective administration of justice and access to the courts.

Rabinowitz, Alaska, Deputy Chairman; Ralph J. Erickstad, North Dakota; Harold Fatzer, L. Delaware; Charles S. House, Connecticut; Joe W. Sanders, Louisiana; Robert J. Sherman, Minnesota. ANNUAL MEETING\u2014AUGUST 1977 RESOLUTION I Be it resolved That the Conference of Chief Justices approve the recommendations of the Committee of Federal-State Relations concerning the following principles: (1) Every citizen should have access to our court system as the ultimate forum for the resolution of unavoidable disputes and the protector of his constitutional rights. (2) The demand for access to our court systems in this country can be expect\u00ad ed to increase significantly in the years ahead\u2014a demand which will be imple\u00ad mented by plans for prepaid legal insurance and other methods of making legal services more generally available. (3) Efforts to divert, where appropriate, the processes of dispute resolution from the federal and state court systems through devices such as arbitration are to be encouraged and accelerated, but such diversion is only a partial answer to the problem. (4) Notwithstanding reasonable expectations of dispute diversion, it can be an\u00ad ticipated that our federal court system will continue to be overburdened unless increased recognition is given to the role of state courts. (5) Our state court systems are able and willing to provide needed relief to the federal court system in such areas as: (A) adaquate review of state court criminal proceedings to assure that federally defined constitutional rights have been fully protected; (B) increased participation in the resolution of federal question cases; (C) the assumption of all or part of the diversity jurisdiction presently ex\u00ad ercised by the federal courts. 219 (6) National funding to the states should include procedures and allocations to assure that the state court systems receive an equitable share of the funds with\u00ad out prejudice to the independence of the judiciary. (7) Increased communication between congressional committees considering legislation affecting state courts and such entities as the Conference of Chief Justices will be useful. RESOLUTIONS OF CONFERENCE OF CHIEF JUSTICES (FROM ANNUAL MEETING\u2014AUGUST 1978) RESOLUTION II Be it resolved by the Conference of Chief Justices of the United States, at the 30th Annual Meeting held in Burlington, Vermont, on August 2 1978, that the following principles should be applied in any efforts to study, analyze, and achieve policies and mechanisms for federal funding of projects for the improvement of justice in the several States: (1) The amount of federal funds to be allocated for improvement of state judi\u00ad cial systems should be fixed by the United States Congress itself. (2) The Congress itself should specify the national-interest purposes and objec\u00ad tives for which the federal funds should be expended. These congressionally de\u00ad fined purposes and objectives should be sufficiently broad to permit each of the states to fund programs for judicial improvement suited specifically to the unique requirements of the particular state. (3) An autonomous federal agency should be designated by the Congress to administer the programs, with significant representation from state court sys\u00ad tems included. (4) The federal funds appropriated for the improvement of the administration of state court systems should be allocated for this purpose in each of the states by that entity responsible under state law for the administration of the course. (5) The use of federal funds for the improvement of state judicial administra\u00ad tion should not be directed exclusively at criminal justice or juvenile justice; should not be limited by the requirement of matching funds; and should not be conditioned upon state agreements of assurances for future financial support. However, tight limitations upon expenditures for \"administrative overhead\" would be appropriate. (6) The Congress should specify that some part of the funds appropriated for the improvement of state court systems should be used to support research, service, and education by an institution or institutions functioning nationally as a resource available to the courts of all of the states, for example, the NCSC. In this connection, careful consideration must be given to the desirability of sepa\u00ad rating policy decisions with respect to long-range research from the immedia\u00ad cies of action programs. (7) Safeguards must be provided to assure that the national objectives justify\u00ad ing the use of federal funds for the improvement of state court systems will be adviced without less of state responsibility for, and authority over state courts. RESOLUTION III Be it resolved by the Conference of Chief Justices of the United States, at the 30th Annual Meeting held in Burlington, Vermont on the 2nd day of August 1978 as fol\u00ad lows: That a national task force, commissioned to study the relation between the Feder\u00ad al Government and the Governments of the several States in providing forums for dispute resolution, is needed; and That such a task force should be authorized to study and analyze the problems of allocation of jurisdiction as between States and Federal Courts in order to avoid du\u00ad plication and intrusion; and That such task force should study and analyze methods by which federal funding' of efforts to improve the administration of justice in the several States can be ac\u00ad complished without sacrifice of the independence of State judicial systems; and That the Conference of Chief Justices is ready and willing to cooperate in the de\u00ad velopment and implementation of such a task force; and That the Executive Council of the Conference of Chief Justices is therefore au\u00ad thorized and directed to take such measures as may be necessary to bring about the creation of such a task force to carry out the research, study, and analysis hereto-220 fore outlined and to make recommendations for future action on the part of this Conference and other affected entities. RESOLUTION IV Whereas, the President and Attorney General of the United States have recom\u00ad mended to the Congress of the United States the enactment of legislation for re\u00ad structuring the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration in an effort to achieve economy in administration without loss of the effective employment of federal funds in a national effort to control crime; and Whereas S. 3270 and its companion, H.R. 13397, have been submitted to the United States Congress for its consideration; and Whereas these bills embrace the principle that the improvement of state court systems, both civil and criminal, is a necessary part of the process of crime control; and Whereas the proposed legislation recognizes that the ultimate responsibility for the allocation of federal funds for the improvement of state court systems should be shared by that legal entity in each of the several States which is charged with the responsibility and supervision of such court systems; Whereas the proposed legislation as introduced would appear to limit to three years federal funding of basic costs of the national research and service organiza\u00ad tions of the state courts, the National Center for State Courts, and thereby severely curtail the effectiveness of the Center and its court service role, Whereas Statewide unification and state assumption of funding are reforms cen\u00ad tral to improvement of state court systems; Whereas the long-term resolution of problems involving the availability of federal funds for the improvement of the administration of justice in the States required further study and analysis: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Conference of Chief Justices of the United States, at-the Annual Meeting held in Burlington, Vermont on August 2, 1978, does, with the ex\u00ad ceptions noted below, hereby endorse and approve those provisions of the proposed legislation which pertain to federal assistance of state court systems as an accept\u00ad able method of dealing with these problems until such time as permanent policies and mechanisms for federal assistance of state court systems are established. Exception 1: The legislation should provide for continued federal funding of basic costs of the National Center for State Courts. Exception 2: The legislation should not impede the desirable movement toward court unification and state funding by including provisions which might be con\u00ad strued to permit local units of government to expend funds for court programs which do not meet statewide priorities set by the highest court of each state or its designee. Adopted at the Thirtieth Annual Meeting held in Burlington, Vermont, August 2, 1978. RESOLUTIONS OF CONFERENCE OF CHIEF JUSTICES (FROM MID-YEAR MEETING\u2014 FEBRUARY 1978) RESOLUTION 2\u2014CITIZEN DISPUTE RESOLUTION ACT Whereas the Conference of Chief Justices recognizes the need for additional dis\u00ad pute resolution programs and resources if each citizen is to be provided a just remedy within the law for all legitimate grievances, and, Whereas the just resolution of many grievances can be accomplished through im\u00ad proved mediation and arbitration procedures; and, Whereas S. 957 as amended (No. 1623) would create a national resource center and provide funds to assist courts, states, localities and non-governmental organiza\u00ad tions in developing new mechanisms for the \"effective, fair, inexpensive and expedi\u00ad tious resolutions of dispute.\" Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Conference of Chief Justices endorses the principle of federally funded technical assistance and demonstration programs designed to improve dis\u00ad pute resolution mechanisms, but with the understanding that such federally fi\u00ad nanced programs recognize the constitutional responsibilities of the judicial branch of state government in the resolution of citizen disputes; and that federally financed programs, at the national, state and local levels, be conducted in keeping with the doctrines of separation of powers and state sovereignty. Adopted in New Orleans on February 10, 1978. 221 Whereas the Conference of Chief Justices is informed of proposed changes in fed\u00ad eral legislation effecting the funding of programs for the improvement of state court. systems. Be it resolved, That the following principles should be respected in this process: (1) State judicial systems are and should be a separate and co-equal branch of state government the independence and integrity of which must be preserved. (2) The federal entity given responsibility for establishing policies relating to the funding of state court systems should include significant representation from such systems. (3) The cohesion of criminal and civil proceedings in judicial systems and the necessity of state wide rather than local judicial policy formulation be recog\u00ad nized. (4) National institutions serving state courts such as the National Center for State Courts must be assured of adequate financial support. Adopted in New Orleans on February 10, 1978. 25-622 O - 84 - 15 222 j^aprame (icnxxi STATE OF IOWA oca MOINCS STATEMENT OF CHIEF JUSTICE W. WARD. REYNOLDSON SUPREME COURT OF IOWA BEFORE THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION FIFTH SEMINAR ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG JANUARY 31, 1982 223 THE WILLINGNESS OF THIS DISTINGUISHED GROUP TO HEAR FROM A STATE COURT JUSTICE IS A THOUGHTFUL AND CONSIDERATE GESTURE. I MUST CONFESS, HOWEVER, TO SOME APPREHENSION\u2014NOT RELATED TO MY FIFTEEN-MINUTE SPEAKING ALLOTMENT, BUT TO MR. ClKIN's WARNING THERE WOULD BE A SUBSEQUENT QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD. MY REACTION, BASED ON MANY YEARS' EXPERIENCE AS A TRIAL LAWYER BEFORE JOINING THE JUDICIARY, IS TO TAKE THE OFFENSIVE AND RAISE THE QUESTIONS, CONFIDENT THAT MY LISTENERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE ULTIMATE LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT ANSWERS TO THE TROUBLING ASPECTS OF FEDERAL-STATE JUDICIAL RELATIONS. IOWA IS A TYPICAL STATE IN THE HEARTLAND OF AMERICA, ITS ECONOMIC FOUNDATION BRACED IN BOTH AGRICULTURE AND MANUFACTURING. ITS POPULATION IS MORE URBAN THAN RURAL AND IS ETHNICALLY, ECONOMICALLY, AND RACIALLY DIVERSE - IN OUR PECULIARLY AMERICAN FASHION. THEREFORE, IN MANY WAYS, THE INTERFACE OF ITS FEDERAL AND STATE LITIGATION IS A MICROCOSM OF NATIONAL JUDICIAL STRENGTHS AND FRAILTIES. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AND EXPERIENCE I HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT PRESENT FEDERAL STATUTES IN THE AREAS OF HABEAS CORPUsl AND 1-28 U.S.C. SECTIONS 2241-54 (1976 & SUPP. Ill 1979). 224 - 2 - DIVERSITY JURISDICTIONS,2 AND SECTION 1983 REMEDIES.* MOREOVER, I QUESTION WHETHER THE RATIONALE UNDERLYING THE ALLOCATION OF FEDERAL VIS-A-VIS STATE JURISDICTION IN SOME OF THOSE ENACTMENTS IS STILL VIABLE, AND WHETHER THE COMBINED FEDERAL AND STATE JUDICIAL DEPARTMENTS CAN BEAR THE PRESENT BURDENS OF THE JUDICIALLY EXPANDED SECTION 1983. I AM ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD DENY FEDERAL COURT JURISDICTION IN CERTAIN CONTROVERSIAL AREAS. I FOOTNOTE THE CAVEAT THAT UNLESS SPECIFIED OTHERWISE, THE VIEWS I EXPRESS ARE MY OWN. THE FIRST QUESTION I POSE ASKS WHY, IN AN ERA OF CRUSHING FEDERAL CASE LOADS, LIMITED FEDERAL FUNDS, AND THE WELCOMED RESURRECTION OF FEDERALISM, THERE IS A CONTINUED DUPLICATION OF JUDICIAL EFFORTS AND AN UNRELENTING OVERSIGHT OF STATE JUDICIAL OPERATIONS. ON THE STATE LEVEL, OUR PROSECUTORIAL RESOURCES ARE BEING SQUANDERED, OUR JUDGES FRUSTRATED, AND OUR CITIZENS DISILLUSIONED BY THE LACK OF FINALITY IN CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS. THE REDUNDANCY OF COLLATERAL FEDERAL HABEAS CORPUS 228 U.S.C. SECTION 1332 (1976). h2 U.S.C. SECTION 1983 (SUPP. Ill 1979). THE ENTIRE SECTION IS AS FOLLOWS: EVERY PERSON WHO, UNDER COLOR OF ANY STATUTE, ORDINANCE, REGULATION, CUSTOM OR USAGE, OF ANY STATE OR TERRITORY OR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, SUBJECTS, OR CAUSES TO BE SUBJECTED, ANY CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES OR OTHER PERSON WITHIN THE JURISDICTION THEREOF TO THE DEPRIVATION OF ANY RIGHTS, PRIVILEGES, OR IMMUNITIES SECURED BY THE CONSTITUTION AND LAWS, SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE PARTY INJURED IN AN ACTION AT LAW, SUIT IN EQUITY, OR OTHER PROPER PROCEEDING FOR REDRESS. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, ANY ACT OF CONGRESS APPLICABLE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SHALL BE CONSIDERED TO BE A STATUTE OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. 225 ATTACKS ON STATE JUDGMENTS^ AND THE SPECTRE OF STATE SUPREME COURT DECISIONS, CAREFULLY RESEARCHED AND REASONED TO PROVIDE DEFENDANTS THE FULL PANOPLY OF FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, BEING SET ASIDE BY THE RULING OF A SINGLE FEDERAL DISTRICT JUDGE5 ARE SHACKLING OUR CRIMINAL LAW. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER ADDRESSED THESE PROBLEMS IN HIS 1981 YEAR-END REPORT ON THE JUDICIARY WHEN HE WROTE: I HOPE CONGRESS WILL PROMPTLY CONSIDER LIMITING FEDERAL COLLATERAL REVIEW OF STATE COURT CONVICTIONS TO CLAIMS OF MANIFEST MISCARRIAGES OF JUSTICE. THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY IS PLAGUED AND BOGGED DOWN WITH LACK OF REASONABLE FINALITY OF JUDGMENTS IN CRIMINAL CASES.

THIS PROCESS INJECTED OVER TWO YEARS OF UNCERTAINTY INTO HIS CASE AFTER HIS STATE APPEAL WAS CONCLUDED, COST IOWA SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO DEFEND THE JUDGMENT IT HAD SECURED IN ONE STATE COURT AND RETAINED IN ANOTHER, AND RISKED TENSIONS BETWEEN THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS IN IOWA. NO ONE SUGGESTS FEDERAL OVERSIGHT OF.STATE DECISIONS INVOLVING FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS SHOULD BE ELIMINATED. ADOPTION OF LEGISLATION LIKE PROPOSALS S. 653 AND H.R. 3416, HOWEVER, WOULD AVOID MANY UNFORTUNATE AND WASTEFUL PROCEEDINGS.10 ^GENERALLY, THESE BILLS WOULD 1) PROHIBIT A FEDERAL MAGISTRATE FROM CONDUCTING EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS IN HABEAS CORPUS CASES INSTITUTED BY STATE PRISONERS WITHOUT CONSENT OF THE PARTIES, 2) CODIFY THE WAINWRIGHT V.

IT IS MY VIEW, SHARED BY MANY STATE JUSTICES, THAT THE SAME PURPOSES WOULD BE SERVED IF THE BILL TO ESTABLISH A NATIONAL COURT OF APPEALS, S, 1529, WERE TO BE MODIFIED TO CREATE A NATIONAL COURT OF STATE APPEALS, UNDER THE SUPREME COURT, TO ASSUME DISCRETIONARY JURISDICTION OF ALL APPEALS FROM, AND ALL COLLATERAL ATTACKS ON, STATE COURT DECISIONS INVOLVING FEDERAL QUEST IONS.11 MY SECOND QUESTION RAISES THE ISSUE WHETHER THE ANTIQUATED FEDERAL ENACTMENTS GRANTING DIVERSITY JURISDICTION TO THE FEDERAL COURTS FINALLY SHOULD BE INTERRED.

FEDERAL COURT LITIGANTS IN THESE CASES CONSUME THE RESOURCES OF BOTH THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS IN DUPLICITOUS EXAMINATIONS OF RELATED ISSUES: FIRST, A FEDERAL SEARCH AND DETERMINATION THERE ARE NO CONTROLLING STATE STATUTES OR PRECEDENTS; AND SECOND, A STATE RESOLUTION OF A QUESTION WE LIKELY WOULD NOT ACCEPT IF PRESENTED AS A GROUND FOR AN INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL FROM A STATE COURT. FEW TODAY SERIOUSLY CONTEND THE NONRESIDENT PARTY SUFFERS FROM LOCAL PREJUDICE SIMPLY BECAUSE OF NONRESIDENCE. AN UNDERLYING BUT SELDOM DISCUSSED REASON DIVERSITY JURISDICTION SURVIVES IS THE ENCRUSTED CONCEPT THAT STATE COURT JUDGES ARE INFERIOR IN SOME WAY, A SUBJECT I SHALL ADDRESS SHORTLY.

SECOND, IT MUST BE RECOGNIZED THAT STATE COURT LITIGATION CONSTANTLY PRESENTS NEW SITUATIONS TESTING THE BOUNDARIES OF FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND REQUIRING JUDGMENT CALLS ON THE APPLICABILITY OF FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES. WITHOUT THE UNIFYING FUNCTION OF SUPREME COURT REVIEW, THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION COULD MEAN SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN EACH OF THE FIFTY STATES.

This council recognizes that there is a legitimate basis for financial support to state judiciaries by the Federal Government if federal funds can be used in such a way as to be consistent with the doctrine of separation of powers and federal\u00ad ism, and that they can provide an impetus for excellence in the operation of state courts. We also concur that federal funds should not be used for basic court services. We specifically support the establishment of an inde\u00ad pendent federal corporation known as the State Justice Institute to accomplish these objectives. Adoption of this resolution was fully concurred by the Judicial Council at their meeting on September 21, 1979 in Reno, Nevada.

Rodino, Jr. 2462 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, D. C. 20515 Dear Pete: Thanks for discussing H. R. 6709 \u2014 the State Justice Institute bill with me the other day. I called you only because I believe the measure is of critical importance to the state courts, and probably to the continued strength of a federal \u2014 state court system. All of us appreciate your sponsorship of this bill and the help you have given. I thought it might be helpful to state in some\u00ad what more detail my reasons for supporting this measure. We in New Jersey's judiciary believe that the federal government has an inherent interest in the quality of justice in the states similar to its interest in health and education. State courts handle 98 per cent of the nation's judicial caseload and it is through experience with these courts that the overwhelming majority of our citizens form their opinion of the judicial system. More directly, the federal interest is based on the facts that: 1. Under the supremacy clause of the Constitution, state courts have a responsibility to enforce the Constitution and laws of the United States and Congress is increasingly relying on them to implement its enactments, i.e., the 55 mile-per-hour speed limit, clean air standards, welfare and employment standards, etc. 242 2. Federal courts and executive agencies are diverting increasing numbers of civil and criminal matters to state courts in order to maintain a comparatively small, high quality federal justice system. 3. Federal courts have imposed increasing procedural due process requirements on state courts in both criminal and civil cases, making them responsible for enforcement of federal rights. Federal policy is increasing the workload of state judiciaries and effective implementation of federal law and policy requires that state judges know of it and how to apply it in a wide variety of cases. If state courts are to remain the basic judicial forum effectively handling the nation's massive caseload, and if the federal courts are to remain a relatively small system of limited jurisdiction, it is essential that state courts be strengthened and that programs for strengthening them be conducted in a manner respecting the independence and individual character of each state system. The State Justice Institute has been carefully structured to meet these goals while bringing national resources to bear on problems common to many or all of the states. It also will provide a mechanism by which the 50 state court systems can deal effectively with the national issues that arise resulting from our dual state-federal justice system. These include complex issues arising under federal diversity of citizenship jurisdiction. Except for programs of the now moribund Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, which have been administered at the federal level without input from the judiciary, there has been no national agency providing direction and funding for the kind of programs essential to the improvement and long term survival of state judiciaries. The State Justice Institute would provide a national resource for which there is a unique and critical need. It would bring national perspectives and resources to bear on problems long neglected because they have fallen between the cracks of a complex federal structure founded on the doctrine of separate powers at both the state and federal evels. 243 To solve the organizational problems posed by our system of federalism and the separation of powers, the State Justice Institute would be an independent federal agency with a majority of its Board of Directors appointed by the President from a panel of judges and state court administrators selected by the Conference of Chief Justices. A minority would be public members selected directly by the President. The bill authorizing its establishment carries no appropriation and even when it is funded it would be a small agency with a modest budget and conduct most of its business by funding projects through the state courts themselves or existing court organizations such as the National Center for State Courts and the National Judicial College. Court funding would be available on a project basis only; there would not be formula or block grants to the states. Funds could be used for research, demonstration, education, training, and national clearinghouse programs. Each state's supreme court or its designated agency would be the responsible administrator of all Institute funds going to a court project in its jurisdiction. The emphasis would be on projects to improve the administration of justice for which state funds are not available. Use of Institute funds for regular activities of the courts is specifically forbidden, i.e., this is not a financial assistance program, but a program to provide the \"margin of excellence\" essential to an effective system of justice and to fund necessary national programs serving the courts of all 50 states. I am sure the foregoing is all well known to you but thought the matter was important enough to set forth my views. Thanks again. ^ 244 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF) STATE DIRECTORS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING PrmUtnt ^-\u00bb/-^ J\u2014\"' ^\\ \\ Mandra / \\J Man. Georgia Boaton, Mattachueatta The Honorable Robert Kastenmeier United States House of Representatives Roan 2232 Dirksen (NSOB) Building Washington D.C. 20515 Dear Representative Kastenmeier: Let me congratulate you on your proposed legislation entitled, \"State Justice Institute Act of 1981.\" As President of this organization, and the .Deputy Commissioner of the New York State Bureau for Municipal Police, I have been following with interest the progress of your bill. The introduction of such a bill, at a time when law enforcement needs are greatest, serves to underscore your involvement and your concern for the profession. In many regards, your philosophy and principles parallel those of the National Association of State Directors of Law Enforcement Training. This being the case, I would like to take the opportunity to offer you the services of NASDLET's resource netwsrk. In law enforcement circles, it is felt that collectivley and individually NASDLET possesses certain re\u00ad sources which should be of benefit to you in your efforts. First, and most important, NASDLET's member states are aware of and in-tune with the needs and problems of the law enforcement community within their respective states. It is felt that by the composition of the various Boards, Councils and Commissions which supervise the individual state activities, that NASDLET members have the \"pulse\" of the police communities within these areas. These Boards, Councils and Commissions are composed of representatives of the law enforcement community within the respective regions and are en\u00ad trusted with the responsibility for the particular state'? operation. Secondly, NASDLET members are responsible for the certification or licensing of peace officers. Such certification and licensing are generally based upon compliance with certain pre-employment, personal qualification standards and upon successful completion of a basic training course. In many NASDLET member states, the member agency is responsible for developing and delivering the training component, certifying the instructors- and insti\u00ad tutions authorized to deliver the course, and also for funding of the course NASDLET 245 The Honorable Robert Kastenmeier October 27, 1981 or the institution. Specific activities which can be provided to you by NASDI^T are as follows: 1. Data Collection - the organization can serve as a data collecting \"broker\" by gathering information upon re\u00ad quest fron the various state level organizations which comprise NASDI\u00a3T and from the individual law enforcement agencies that represent its clientele. 2. Report Jteview and Analysis - NASDLET's Executive Board could be used as a sounding mechanism for reviewing and/ or analyzing law enforcement related reports or proposals This role may be perceived as one of assistance to you and your staff. 3. Information Dissemination - NASDI\u00a3T has already in place a delivery system for disseminating information on law enforcement matters. Specifically, information could be included in the Newsletter to the NASDIfTT membership, and, in turn, NASDI\u00a3T members could disseminate this information to the law enforcement agencies in their respective states. In addition, NASDLET maintains current and mechanized mailing lists of all law enforcement agencies within the respective member states. 4. Coordination - the individual members of NASDUTT or the regional chairpersons of the Boards, Councils and Corrmissions could serve a coordinative function by assisting in the setting up of public hearings, forums or conferences. In addition, NASDI^T could submit for examination and discussion relevant questions relating to identified topics. 5. Speech Writing - NASDI\u00a3T's Executive Office could provide input and drafts of speeches for law enforcement audiences. 6. People Identification - NASDI\u00a3T could provide lists of in\u00ad dividuals for assignment to various task force groups, com\u00ad mittees or forums. tlASDLET maintains contacts with subject matter experts throughout the law enforcement community. In November, I will be in Washington D.C. to meet with representatives of various federal agencies. I will be accompanied by Gary F. Egan and Stephen J. Mandra, respectively. Executive Director and Director of Police Training for the Massachusetts Criminal Justice Training Council. We would appreciate an op\u00ad portunity to meet with you or one of your staff members for a discussion of how NASDI\u00a3T may actively assist you. Sincerely yours. William G.

Of those replying, 81% favored the appointment of four (4) additional members to the State Justice Institute Act from a list of fourteen (14) attorneys to be furnished by the American Bar Association. Seventy-five percent (75%) favored the allowance of provisions for in-house research capabilities for the State Justice Institute Act. Seventy-five percent (75%) of those responding did not favor the right of each State Supreme Court to veto any grant for that state. A total of eighty-eight percent (88%) were in favor of support of the State Justice Institute Act by the YLD Judicial Administration Committee. > I am forwarding a copy of this report to the current Chairman and Chairman-elect of the Judicial Administration Division. I am also distributing a copy of the report to the. Judicial Administration coChairman. I am also forwarding a copy to Senator Heflin for his information. 248 Mr. C. Edward Dobbs August 3, 1982 Page 2 It is my summation of our research and it is the Judicial Administration Committee's position that strong sentiment exist in the American Bar Association Young Lawyers Division for the appointment of at least four (4) attorneys to the proposed non-profit corporation to provide a very real and needed input from members of the legal profession. Furthermore, the Young Lawyers Division Judicial Administration Committee strongly feels that State Supreme Courts should not have veto powers over the funding request by a state or local court or its designated agency or council. I would recommend to you, the officers and Board of the American Bar Association - Young Lawyers Division, and to its membership that a resolution be passed at the annual convention reflecting the position of your Judicial Adminis\u00ad tration Committee. Unfortunately, I will be unable to attend the annual meeting in San Francisco and I have asked Tom Miller, our co-Chairman of the Judicial Administration Division to answer any questions which may be raised concerning our position.

SENATE BILL 537 - State Justice Institute Act of 1981. June 25, 1982 PLEASE TAKE FIVE MINUTES AND COMPLETE THE ATTACHED FORM IT WILL REALLY HELP US IN DETERMINING A FINAL COMMITTEE POSITION. As you may know, Senate Bill 537 introduced by Senator Heflin (D-AL) was passed from the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 31, 1981. As of this date, the Senate has not taken affirmative action on this Senate Bill. The Judicial Administration Division of the American Bar Association has passed a resolution recommending the American Bar Association support enactment by Congress of Senate 537. The State Justice Institute Act of 1981 is an outgrowth of the report of the Task Force on the State Court Improvement Act which was issued in May of 1979. This report was jointly issued by Committee of the Conference of Chief Justices and the Conference of State Court Administrators. American Bar Association representation participated in some of the deliberations of this committee. Senate Bill 537 would create a private non-profit TO: FROM: RE: DATE: 250 corporation supervised by an 11 member board of directors appointed by the President. There are to be 4 public members, ( judges, and 1 court administrator. The stated purpose of the institute is to \"assist the State Courts and organizations which support them to obtain the requirements . . . for a strong anc effective court through a funding mechanism, consistent with the doctrines of separation of powers and federalism, and thereby to improve the quality of justice available to the American people.\" Previous meetings with committee members have indicated that this noble cause certainly is one which should be supported by our committee. However, there have been raised several specific questions concerning provisions of Senate Bill 537. I have prepared a ballot which is attached to this memorandum for your vote on these specific issues. Your ballot must be returned in the self-addressed envelope by July 15, 1982 in order to be calculated in determining the official Judicial Administration Committee position on the Bill. The following is a summary of the arguments concerning the Bill's provisions: 1. The Bill does not provide for any input from attorneys participating as members of the Board of Directors of the non-profit corporation. There is no requirement that the A public members be attorneys. However, the 6 judges and 1 state court administrator are appointed from a list of candidates submitted by the conference of Chief Justices. The conference of Chief Justices must submit a list of at least 14 individuals including judges and state court administrators from which the 251 President may make an appointment. Several committee members have voiced strong opposition to these criteria for selecting the board of directors. They argue attorneys who participate in the judicial system on every level would add an additional perspective not necessarily offered by judges or public members unfamiliar with the daily workings of the court system. 2. Jim Wright has raised the questions proposed as No. 2 and 3 on your ballot. His feeling is that the legislation does not envision the institute having significant in house research capabilities. He believes existence of a more substantial research staff could be more cost efficient in providing supporting coordination for many different organizations. Also, he has raised the question that the State Supreme Court has a right to veto any grant application. This is provided in Section 6(b)(4) which specifically states \"each application for funding by a state or local court shall be approved by the state's supreme court, or its designated agency or counsel, which shall receive administer and be accountable for all funds awarded by the institute to such courts.\" This could lead to a veto of a grant to an organization which is unpopular with members of the supreme court and does not assure that the separation of powers and judicial accountability. Finally, we have asked your opinion concerning whether or not the bill should be supported by the Judicial Administration Committee at all. Please do not forget the July 15th deadline. 252 Should you have any questions or desire any copies of any bills or the ABA Judicial Administration Report, please do not hesitate to contact me or in the event of my absence, my secretary, Gail Butler. Thank you very much for your help and I will keep everyone informed on how matters progress. 253 JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATION BALLOT SENATE BILL 537 STATE JUSTICE INSTITUTE ACT OF 1981 1.

Office of (he Aisiiunt Allo'wy General totimftoa. D.C. 20S30 JUL 29 1981 Honorable Peter W. Rodino Chairman Committee on the Judiciary House of Representatives Washington, D. C. 20515 Dear Mr. Chairman: This is in response to your request for the views of the Department of Justice on H.R. 2407, the State Justice Institute Act. For the reasons set out in this letter, the Administration opposes this legislation. The concept of the State Justice Institute was initially advanced in the report on the Conference of Chief Justices and Conference of State Court Administrators Task Force for a State Justice System improvement Act. 1/ The Institute was conceived of as a more satisfactory means of managing federal funding of state court improvement projects, and of providing a secure source of continued financial support for national organizations concerned with state court improvement, such as the National Center for State Courts. 2/ The existing system of funding, administered primarily by LEAA, was thought to be deficient on several grounds. The setting of policy by a federal executive agency with respect to state court improvement projects was seen to raise problems of federalism and of separation of powers. 3/ The inclusion of state 1/ The report is reprinted in state Justice Institute Act of 1979: Hearings on S. 2387 Before the Subcomm. on Jurisprudence and Governmental Relations of the Senate Comm. on the Judiciary, 96th Cong., 1st & (1980) supra note 1, at 64-66, 77-82, 173-74. 3/ See Senate Committee Report, supra note 2, at 22-23; Senate Hearings, supra note 1, at 10-11, 170-172. 255 court funding as one aspect of a broader program concerned with all types of law enforcement activities placed the state courts in the position of competing with state executive agencies for limit\u00ad ed federal funds, and failed to give recognition to the distinc\u00ad tive and independent character of the state judiciaries. 4/ The law enforcement mandate of LEAA imposed constraints on the use of funds for projects concerned with the civil aspects of state court systems, 5_/ and the uncertainty that existed over the general fate of LEAA raised doubts that funding of state court projects would continue without special provision. 6_/ The solution proposed was to create a private non-profit corporation, the State Justice Institute, which would be governed by a body composed primarily of state court personnel. The Insti\u00ad tute would receive a separate appropriation from the federal government and, within the context of the broad guiding principles set out in the implementing legislation, would have discretion to allocate funds to the state courts and to organizations concerned with state court improvement. The proposal for creation of the State Justice Institute was introduced in the 96th Congress as S. 2387 and H.R. 6709. S. 2387 was the subject of hearings on Oct. 18 and Nov. 19, 1979, and on March 19, 1980, before the Sub\u00ad committee on Jurisprudence and Governmental Relations of the Senate Judiciary Committee, under the direction of Senator Heflin. 1/ The bill was brought to a vote on July 21, 1980, and passed unanimously by the Senate. 8/ 4/ See Senate Committee Report, supra note 2, at Senate Hear\u00ad ings, supra note 1, at 16-17. 5/ See Senate Committee Report, supra note 2, at 24-25; Senate Hearings, supra note 1, at 26-27, 74. <[/ See Senate Committee Report, supra note 2, at 25. 2/ See Senate Hearings, supra note 1. 6/ The Senate Committee Report accompanying the bill is cited in note 2 supra. The report contained a statement by Senator Thurmond indicating that he would have preferred that the states bear all the financial burden for maintaining and improving their judicial systems, but that he had decided not to oppose the legis\u00ad lation, subject to two amendments he had proposed which were incorporated into the version of the bill approved by the full Judiciary Committee. See Senate Committee Report, supra note 2, at 33-35. - 2 -256 The current version of the proposal, on which we have been asked to comment, is H.R. 2407. 9/ The bill would create a State Justice Institute that would direct a national program of assis\u00ad tance for state court improvement by providing funds to state courts and other appropriate organizations. The Institute would be headed by a Board of Directors whose voting members would be six judges, one state court administrator, and four public members. The President would appoint the Board members with the advice and consent of the Senate. The President's choices in nominating the six judges and the state court administrator for membership on the Board would be limited to a list of at least fourteen candidates submitted by the Conference of Chief Justices. The provisions of the bill relating to grants and contracts indicate that Institute funds are to be used primarily for research, demonstrations, innovative projects, and other justice improvement measures, and are not to be employed to support basic court services. Matching funds equal to 25% of the total cost of a grant to, or contract with, a state or local judicial system must normally be provided by the recipient. The Institute is gen\u00ad erally barred from involvement in litigation and political activi\u00ad ties. The funding authorized for the Institute is $20,000,000 in 1982, $30,000,000 in 1983, and $40,000,000 in 1984. The goals that the Institute proposal is designed to further are obviously important, and the specific arrangements set out in H.R. 2407 seem generally well designed to advance these objectives. However, we have concluded that we cannot support this legislation. The reasons for this conclusion are largely budgetary. The pro\u00ad posal does not bear any of the most obvious earmarks of a new funding project that should be advanced in a time of austerity. It does not relate specifically to an area that has been made the responsibility of the federal government by the Constitution or federal law; it does not relate specifically to a stated priority of the Administration or the Department of Justice; and it does not address a problem of national scope that the states are inherently incapable of dealing with on their own. Indeed, it is far from clear to us that the state courts are the element of state justice systems most urgently in need of additional funding. These three points will be discussed with greater particularity in the remainder of this letter. (i) Federal Interest and Responsibility. The proponents of the State Justice Institute have argued that the propriety and desirability of federal funding for state court improvement pro\u00ad jects follow from the fact that the state courts are, in a sense, 9/ The current Senate counterpart is S. 537. - 3 -257 federal courts. The state courts, under the Supremacy Clause, are required to enforce federal law, and a substantial portion of their time and resources is taken up in doing so. The state courts are also required to comply with the constitutional requirements of due process. The costs of discharging both of these responsibili\u00ad ties have increased greatly in recent decades as a result of the decisions of Congress in expanding the scope of federal law and the decisions of the Supreme Court in interpreting the federal Constitution. It is argued that some level of federal funding for state court activities is required as a matter of fairness, or is at least appropriate, given the general federal interest in the adequate administration of federal law, and the burdens which the state courts bear in discharging their federal responsibilities. 10/ These considerations are not without force. However, certain countervailing considerations may also be noted. In forming the United States the individual states made the judgment that the general benefits of national government would outweigh the result\u00ad ing costs to them. The same judgment was made subsequently by the remaining states in joining the union. The quid pro quo for the burdens resulting from the responsibilities of statehood\u2014including enforcement and compliance with federal law\u2014need not take the form of reimbursement to the states for the specific expenditures incurred in discharging these responsibilities, but may be found in the general functions which the federal government carries out to the benefit of the states, such as national defense and the regulation of interstate commerce. It may also be noted that the federal courts bear certain burdens which would otherwise be borne by the state courts, though no reimbursement is expected from the states in return for such activities. For example, when jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship, the federal courts hear state law cases which would otherwise have to be handled by the state courts. Essentially the same point can be made in relation to the full range of subjects which are currently regulated by federal laws whose enforcement is partially or wholly committed to the federal courts. In the absence of assumption of responsibility by the federal government for regulation and enforcement in these areas\u2014for example, patents, bankruptcy and antitrust\u2014the states would need to under\u00ad take their own regulation, and the resulting burden of enforcement would fall on the state courts. 10/ See Senate Committee Report, supra note 2, at 18-22; Senate Hearings, supra note 1, at 7-8, 111-13, 144-61. - 4 -258 Finally, while the federal interest in the adequate adminis\u00ad tration of federal law does provide some support for the propriety or desirability of federal assistance to state courts in enforcing and complying with federal law, the State Justice Institute Act is not especially designed to further this interest. The Act does not require that funds disbursed by the Institute be used exclu\u00ad sively or primarily to assist state courts in enforcing or comply\u00ad ing with federal law, but authorizes support of projects relating to nearly all aspects of state court improvement. (ii) Relationship to Administration Priorities. The Adminis\u00ad tration has identified violent crime as an area of priority con\u00ad cern. This priority has been reflected in the creation of the Attorney General's Task Force on Violent Crime. The State Justice Institute proposal does have some general relationship to this priority, since many of the projects funded by the Institute would presumably contribute, directly or indirectly, to improvement of the ability of the state courts to deal with violent crime, and crime in general. However, the legislation does not create any presumption in favor of the allocation of Institute funds to pro\u00ad jects concerned with violent crime, or any other Administration priority. By design, decisions concerning grants and contracts are left to the Institute's Board of Directors which would operate free of federal control. The violent Crime Task Force is reportedly considering recom\u00ad mending the resumption of LEAA-type funding of certain projects on a more limited and controlled scale. If such a recommendation is forthcoming, the criticisms of the past system of assistance to state court projects through LEAA funding that have accompanied the State Justice Institute proposal should be taken into account in deciding on the mechanism for allocating funds to judicial pro\u00ad jects, if such projects are to be funded. However, this question will have to be considered within the context of the general recommendations of the Task Force concerning federal funding of state and local justice improvement projects. (iii) State Competence. The principal functions of the State Justice Institute would be to make decisions concerning the dis\u00ad bursement of federal funds to state court improvement efforts, and to handle the award and monitoring of such grants and contracts. At least in theory, the same type of Institute might be created by all the states, or a group of interested states, with funds con\u00ad tributed by the subscribing states substituting for the federal money authorized in the current legislative proposals. Supporters of the legislation have responded to this objection by pointing to the uneven commitment of the various states to provision of - 5 -259 sufficient support for the operation and improvement of their own court systems, 11/ and the difficulty of securing state funding for national organizations\u2014such as the National Center for State Courts\u2014which provide important services to the state judiciaries. Problems of this sort may make a state-based alternative less effective than a federally supported State Justice Institute, or perhaps simply unfeasible. 12/ However, the proponents of the Institute have only claimed that the states have been unwilling to provide adequate overall support for state court improvement efforts\u2014not that they are incapable of doing so\u2014and a state-based system would offer certain advantages over the federal funding approach. In particular, a state-based system would remove all elements of federal influence and control from decisions concern\u00ad ing the allocation of funds to state court systems, and would allow each state to decide whether the benefits to it from partic\u00ad ipation in the system justify the cost of subscription or membership. In sum, the Administration opposes H.R. 2407 and equivalent proposals for the creation of a federally funded State Justice Institute. 13/ 11/ See Senate Hearings, supra note 1, at 47. 12/ A state-based system would also face the practical problem of allocating costs among the subscribing states in a mutually acceptable manner. See Senate Hearings, supra note 1, at 112. 13/ There is a specific feature of H.R. 2407 which merits sepa\u00ad rate comment. As noted earlier, the President's choices for seven of the members of the Board of Directors of the State Justice Institute would be limited to a list of candidates submitted by the Conference of Chief Justices. This provision raises serious constitutional doubts. We recognize that Congress can impose qualifications for the persons whom the President seeks to appoint, and define the general class of persons from which the President may make an appointment, including the requirement that appointees to certain offices must be selected from lists submitted by the Conference of Chief Justices. See Myers v. United States, 252 U.S. 52, 265-74 (1926) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). On the other hand, the power of Congress to impose qualifications for appoint\u00ad ments does not mean that the President can be compelled to appoint persons whom he considers unsuitable for the position. In other words, the qualification provision of the type here involved means that the appointee must be acceptable to the Conference of Chief Justices as well as to the President. A list submitted to the (Continued) - 6 -260 The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there is no objection to the submission of this report from the standpoint of the Administration's program.

A provision for a list containing \"at least\" fourteen names for seven appointments, i.e., two for each vacancy, does not in our view comply with that requirement, unless it is assumed implicitly, in order to save the constitutionality of the provision, that the President has the right to reject a list which does not contain any acceptable nomi\u00ad nees.

The concept of the State Justice Institute was initially advanced in the Report of the Conference of Chief Justices and Conference of State Court Administrators Task Force for a State Justice System Improvement Act. \u2014 The principal function of the Institute would be to administer a funding program for state court improvement. The program would involve grants to particular state and local court systems for innovative and demonstration projects, and provision of financial support to the national support institutions of the state judiciaries, including the National Center for State Courts. 2/ The Institute would receive federal funds for purposes of carrying out this program. The Institute would also carry out other functions, including serving as a liaison between the federal and state judiciaries, making 1^/ The report is reprinted in State Justice Institute Act of 1979: Hearings on S. 2387 Before the Subcomm. on Juris\u00ad prudence and Governmental Relations of the Senate Comm. on the Judiciary, 96th Cong., 1st & 2d Sess., at 135-201 (1980). 2/ The importance of the activities of the National Center for State Courts was recently re-emphasized by the Chief Justice in his 1981 Year-End Report on the Judiciary. See id. at 23-24. We concur in his assessment of the importance of the work of the National Center for the nation's judicial systems. 263 - 2 - recommendations concerning the proper allocation of responsibi\u00ad lities between the state and federal courts, promoting recog\u00ad nition of the importance of the doctrine of separation of powers, and promoting judicial education. \u2014 In response to a request of Chairman Rodino, the Adminis\u00ad tration transmitted a letter to Congress in July of 1981 stating 4/ our views regarding the State Justice Institute proposal. \u2014 Our response noted that the objectives of the proposal are obviously important, and that difficulties could arise in connection with efforts to achieve them by other means. However, we concluded that the proposal should not be adopted for budgetary reasons and certain other reasons. For example, while the President would appoint the Board of Directors of the Institute, it would not be subject to the control of the federal executive. It would accordingly be free to transmit its funding requests directly to Congress, with the role of the Office of Management and Budget limited to review and comment at the time of transmittal. At this point we must reiterate our opposition to enactment of the State Justice Institute proposal. As before, our objec\u00ad tions are largely budgetary in nature. In the remainder of my 3/ See H.R. 2407 S 3(b). 4/ See Letter of Assistant Attorney General Robert A. McConnell to Honorable Peter W. Rodino, Chairman, House Committee on the Judiciary (July 29, 1981). 264 - 3 - statement I will explain the grounds for our opposition and ad\u00ad dress the relationship of the State Justice Institute proposal to certain court improvement measures supported by the Administration. I. Grounds of Opposition The proponents of the State Justice Institute have advanced a number of arguments in support of the desirability and propriety of providing federal funds for its operation. They have noted that there is a degree of direct federal interest in the fairness and efficiency of state proceedings, since the state courts play a role in the administration of federal law. The specifically federal activities of the state courts include adjudicating federal causes of action in a variety of areas in which Congress has given the state courts concurrent jurisdiction, entertaining federal defenses that are raised in any type of civil action, and protecting the federal rights of defendants in state criminal proceedings. The burden of these responsibilities on the state courts has grown in recent years as a result of the decisions of Congress in expanding the scope of federal law and the decisions of the Supreme Court in interpreting the federal Constitution. The Institute's proponents have also suggested that the Insti\u00ad tute's activities would facilitate future adjustments in the divi\u00ad sion of jurisdiction between the state and federal courts, thereby relieving the overburdened dockets of the federal courts and achieving an allocation of state and federal responsibilities that better serves the interests of federalism. 265 - 4 - We are not insensitive to the force of these considerations, but do not believe that they can be accorded conclusive weight. The acute financial condition of the federal government, and the need to exercise restraint even in relation to proportionately limited budgetary items, require no comment. The appropriations authorized by H.R. 2407 for the first three years of the Insti\u00ad tute's operation are $20,000,000, $30,000,000, and $40,000,000. An expenditure approaching $100,000,000 over a three year period is certainly substantial. Moreover, we are concerned over the ascending scale of the proposed appropriations, suggesting an ever-increasing federal contribution from year to year. Federal funding programs, once underway, have all too often grown far beyond initial expectations. It should also be noted that we have limited federal assis\u00ad tance to state justice systems in other areas. Police, prosecutors and correctional institutions at the state and local level, as well as the state courts, are presently soliciting renewed federal financial support. The arguments that might be advanced by these other interests are similar to those of the courts \u2014 police and prosecutors have also incurred additional burdens and expenditures as a result of the expansion of the federal rights of suspects and defendants, and prison systems in many states have been re\u00ad quired to undertake major reforms as the result of direct federal intervention in suits challenging prison conditions. In terms of need, it is not apparent that the other elements of state and local justice systems are less deserving than the courts, or that 266 - 5 - denial of their requests could be justified if those of the courts were granted. II. Relationship to Diversity Jurisdiction and Habeas Corpus Proposals The solicitation of the Administration's views for these hearings included a specific request for discussion of the relationship of the State Justice Institute proposal to other judicial improvement measures that the Administration supports, including the abolition of diversity jurisdiction and habeas corpus reform. The diversity proposal is H.R. 6816, which was recently voted out by the full Judiciary Committee. The Admini\u00ad stration's habeas corpus reform proposals have been introduced by Representative Lungren as H.R. 6050, which is presently before this Subcommittee. There is an obvious relationship between the State Justice Institute proposal and the proposal to abolish diversity juris\u00ad diction. The elimination of diversity jurisdiction would bring about a very large reduction in the workload of the federal courts and a substantial reduction in the expenditures required for their operation, but would do so at the expense of a slight increase in the overall workload of the state judiciaries. We would ac\u00ad cordingly give further thought to our position on.the State Justice Institute proposal if the diversity proposal were adopted. 267 - 6 - There is otherwise no direct relationship between H.R. 2407 and these other proposals. The habeas corpus reform proposals of H.R. 6050 would not increase the workload of the state judiciaries, but would reduce litigational burdens resulting from collateral proceedings at both the state and federal levels. We are aware that much of the opposition to the diversity jurisdiction and habeas corpus proposals has reflected apprehension by some members of Congress concerning possible bias or other deficiencies in the state courts. We do not, however, believe that such concerns are well-founded. The state courts are competent to decide civil disputes between inhabitants of different states, and to protect the rights of state criminal defendants under a more limited system of federal review, without the contribution of federal funds contem\u00ad plated by the State Justice Institute proposal. 268 III. Conclusion In sum, the Administration continues to oppose enactment of the State Justice Institute proposal of H.R. 2407. We do not believe that a new funding program of this type can be justified. b_/ 5/ In a concluding footnote in our initial response letter, we stated a particular objection to the requirement that the President appoint seven members of the Board of Directors from a list of at least fourteen candidates submitted by the Conference of Chief Justices. We questioned the constitu\u00ad tionality of such a mode of selection on the basis of Con\u00ad stitution, Art. II, Section 2, CI. 2, which regulates the manner of appointment of \"officers of the United States.\" It is dubious, however, that the members of the Board of Directors would be \"officers of the United States\" in the pertinent sense in light of various provisions of the pro\u00ad posed Act, including an express statement in section 4(e) that the members of the Board shall not, by reason of their membership, be considered officers or employees of the United States. Independently of any question of constitu\u00ad tional constraint, we find objectionable as a basic matter of policy a selection procedure which narrowly constrains the President's discretion and is open to the possibility that he will be required to appoint a person he regards as inappropriate or unfit for the position. Provisions calling for the President to appoint individuals from a list of sub\u00ad mitted names should provide that the President can require the submission of additional names. 269 APPENDIX III LAW REVIEW ARTICLES [Reprinted from 00 Ilarv. L. Rev. 4S0 (lfl77) copyright The Harvard Law Review Association 1077] STATE CONSTITUTIONS AND THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL IIIOIITS (By \"William J. Brennnn, Jr.\u00bb) During the JDGO's, as the Supremo Court expanded the measure of federal protection for individual rights, there was little need for liti\u00ad gants to rest their claims, or judges their decisions, on state constitu\u00ad tional grounds. Jn this Arti-cle, Mr. Justice Jlrcmiun argues that the trend of recent 'Supreme Court civil liberties decisions should promtpt a reap\u00ad praisal of that strategy. He particularly notes the numerous state courts which have already extended to their citizens, via state constitutions, greater protections than the Supreme Court has held are'applicable under the federal Hill of Rights. Finally, he discusses, and applauds, the impli\u00ad cations of this new state court activism for the structure of American federalism-. Reaching the hiblical summit of three score and ten seems to he (he occasion\u2014 or the excuse\u2014for looking back. Forty-eight years ago I entered law school and forty-four years ago was admitted to the New Jersey Bar. In those days of innocence, the preoccupation of the profession, bench and bar, was with questions usually answered by application of state common law principles or state statutes. Any necessity to consult federal law was at best episodic. But those were also the grim days of the Depression, and its cure was dramatically to change the face of American law. The year 1033 witnessed the birth of a plethora of new federal laws and new federal agencies developing and enforcing those laws; ones that were to affect profoundly the daily lives of every person In the nation. In my days at law school, Felix Frankfurter had taught administrative law in terms of the operations of the Interstate Commerce Commission\u2014because that was the only major federal regulatory agency then existing. But then came in rapid succession the National Labor Relations Board, the Securities and Ex\u00ad change Commission, the Civil Aeronautics Board, the 'Federal Communications Commission, tbe Federal Power Commission and a host of others. In addition, laws such as the Fair Labor Standards Act, administered by the Labor Depart\u00ad ment, also began to require practitioners to master new, and federal, fields of law in order to serve their clients. And, of course, those laws and agencies did not disappear with the end of the Depression\u2014rather a procession of still more fed\u00ad eral agencies and federal laws has followed. Only recently, for example, Congress created the Environmental Protection Agency and the Equal Employment Oppor\u00ad tunity Commission\u2014new major sources of concern for today's clients keeping lawyers everywhere very federal law-minded. In the beginning of this legal revolution, however, federal law was not a major concern of state judges. Judicial involvement with decisions of the new federal agencies was the business of federal courts. I have tried to recall how often in my years on the New Jersey courts from 1049 to 1050 issues of federal laws were relevant to cases tried before me as a trial judge in Paterson and Jersey City, or were addressed by mo on the appellate division or In the supreme court. I can remember only three cases out of the hundreds with which I was involved over those years that turned on the resolution of u federal question, and in all three that question was statutory. Two were cases tried before me in Jersey City, one a railroad worker's 6uit under the Federal Employers Liability Act and the other a case that implicated the Immigration and Naturalization Act. Undoubtedly the reason they nre still fresh in my memory is that I had franti\u00ad cally to dig up the federal statutes and federal eases that bore on their disposi\u00ad tion because both presented federal questions of first Impression In my experi\u00ad ence. The third instance was a labor injunction case in which I first circulated 'Associate Justice. United States Supreme Court. 25-622 0-84-18 270 an opinion to my brethren on the supreme court sustaining a chancery injunc\u00ad tion against peaceful picketing, only to have to withdraw the opinion and set aside the Injunction when the United States Supreme Court held that federal law preempted state regulation of such picketing. In recent years, however, another variety of federal law\u2014that fundamental law protecting all of us from the use of governmental powers In ways incon\u00ad sistent with American conceptions of human liberty\u2014has dramatically altered the grist of the state courts. Over the past two decades, decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States have returned to the funadmental promises wrought by the blood of those who fought our War between the States, promises which were thereafter embodied in our fourteenth amendment\u2014that the citizens of all our states are also and no less citizens of our United States, that this birth\u00ad right guarantees our federal constitutional liberties against encroachment by governmental action at any level of our federal system, and that each of ua is entitled to due process of law and the equal protection of the laws from our state governments no less than from our national one. Although courts do not today substitute their personal economic beliefs for I be judgments of our democrati\u00ad cally elected legislatures1 Supreme Court decisions under the fourteenth amend\u00ad ment have significantly affected virtually every other area, civil and criminal, of state action. And while these decisions have been accompanied by the enforce\u00ad ment of federal rights by federal courts, they have significantly altered the work of state court judges as well. This is both necessary and desirable under our federal system\u2014state courts no less than federal are and ought to be the guardi\u00ad ans of our liberties. But the point I want to stress here is that state courts cannot r(!\u00abt when they have afforded their citizens the full protections of the federal Constitution. State constitutions, too, are a font of individual liberties, their protections often ex\u00ad tending beyond those required by the Supreme Court's interpretation of federal law. The legal revolution which has brought federal law to the fore must not be allowed to inhibit the independent protective force of state law\u2014for without it, the full realization of our liberties cannot be guaranteed. ******* The decisions of the Supreme Court enforcing the protections of the fourteenth amendment generally fall into one of three categories. The first concerns enforce\u00ad ment of the federal guarantee of equal protection of the laws. While the best known, of course are Brown v. Board of Education * and Baker v. Carr,* perhaps even more the concern of state bench bar in terms of state court litigation are decisions Invalidating stote legislative classifications that Impermissibly impinge on the exercise of fundamental rights, such as the rights to vote,' to travel interstate,\" or to bear or beget a child.\" Equally important are decisions that require exacting judicial scrutiny of classifications that operate to the pe\u00ad culiar disadvantage of politically powerless groups whose members have histori\u00ad cally been subjected to purposeful discrimination\u2014racial minorities' and aliens* are two examples. The second category of decisions concerns the fourteenth amendment's guar\u00ad antee against the deprivation of life, liberty or property where that deprivation is without due process of law. The root requirement of due process is that, except for some extraordinary situations, an individual be given an opportunity for a hearing before he is deprived of any significant \"liberty\" or \"property\" interest, Our decisions enforcing the guarantee of the due process clause have elaborated the essence of that \"liberty\" and \"property\" in light of conditions existing in contemporary society. For example, \"property\" has come to embrace such crucial expectations as a driver's licence' and the statutory entitlement to minimal eco\u00ad nomic support, in the form of welfare, of those who by accident, birth or circum- 1 Ferguson v.

Curr, because lie believed that if each of us has an equal vote, we are equally armed with the indispensable means to make our views felt. I feel at least as good a case can bo made that the series of decisions binding the states to almost all of the restraints of the Bill of Rights will be even more significant in preserving and furthering the ideals we have fashioned for our society. Before the fourteenth amendment was added to the Constitution, the Supreme Court held that the Bill of Rights did not restrict state, but only federal, action.\" In the decades between JSGS, when the fourteenth amendment was adopted, and 1S!)7, the Court decided in case after case that the amendment did not apply various specific restraints in the Kill of Rights to state action.\" The break\u00ad through came in 18!)7 when the prohibition against taking private property for public use without payment, of just compensation was held embodied in the fourteenth amendment's proscription, \"nor shall any stnte deprive any person . . property, without dne process of law.\"'\" But extension of the rest of the specific restraints was slow in coining.

Those years witnessed the extension to the states of nine of the specifics of the Hill of ltights; decisions which have had a profound impact on American life, requiring the deep involvement, of state courts in the application of federal law.

It is the duty of courts to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen, and against, any stealthy encroachments thereon.\"3\" The thread of this series of Bill of Rights holdings reflects a conclusion\u2014 arrived at only after a long series of decisions grappling with the pros and cons of the question\u2014that, there exists in modern America the necessity for protecting all of us from arbitrary action hy governments more powerful and more per\u00ad vasive than any in our ancestors' lime. Only if the amendments are construed to preserve their fundamental policies will I hey ensure the maintenance of our constitutional structure of government for a tree society. For the genius of our Constitution resides not. in any static meaning that it had in a world that is dead and gone, but in the adaptability of its great, principles to cope with the problems of a developing America. A principle to be vital must be of wider application than the mischief that gave it birth. Constitutions are not ephemeral documents, designed to meet passing occasions. The future is their care, and therefore, in their application, our contemplation cannot be only of what has been but of what may he. * * * * * * * Of late, however, more and more state courts arc construing state constitutional counterparts of provisions of the Bill of Kiglits as guaranteeing citizens of their states even more protection than the federal provisions, even those identically phrased. This is surely an important and highly significant development for our constitutional jurisprudence ami for our concept of federalism. I suppose it was only natural that when during the l!Ri()'s our rights and liberties were in the process of becoming increasingly federalized, state courts saw no reason to consider what protections, if any, were secured by slate constitutions.

It may not he wide of the. mark, however, to supiHise that these state courts discern, and disagree with, a trend in recent opinions of the United States Supreme Court to pull back from, or at least suspend for the time being, the enforcement of the Jioyd principle with respect to application of the federal Kill of Higlits and the restraints of the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment. Under the equal protection clause, for example, the Court has found per\u00ad missible laws that accord lesser protection to over hall' of the members of our society due to their susceptibility to the medical condition of pregnancy,31 as well as laws that impose special burdens on those of our citizens who are of illegitimate birth. The Court lias also found nncompelling the claims of those barred from judicial l'ormns due to their inability to pay access fees,3* and has further handicapped the indigent by limiting their right to free trial transcripts when challenging the legality of their imprisonment.\"' Under the due process clause, the Supreme Court has found no liberty interest in the reputation of an individual\u2014never tried and never convicted\u2014who is publicly branded as a criminal by the jiollce without lienelit of notice, let alone a hearing.\" The Court has recently indicated that tenured public employees might, not be entitled to any more process before deprivation of their employment than the government sees lit to give them.\" It has approved the termination of payments to disabled individuals who are completely dependent upon those pay\u00ad ments, prior to an oral hearing, a form of hearing statistically shown to result in a huge rate of reversals of preliminary administrative determinations.'3 And it has veered from its promise to recognize that prisoners, too, have liberty interests that cannot be ignored.\" The same trend is repeated in the category of the specific guarantees of the Ilill of Higlits. The Court lias found the first amendment insuiliciently llexihle to guurn'ntee access to essential public forums when in our evolving society those traditional forums are under private ownership in the form of suburban shop\u00ad ping centers,\" and at the same time has found the amendment's prohibitions insufficient to invalidate a system of restrictions on motion picture theaters based upon the content of their presentations.\"1 It has found that the warrant require\u00ad ment plainly appearing on the face of the fourth, amendment does not require the police to obtain a warrant before arrest, however easy it might have been to get an arrest warrant.\" It has declined to read the fourth amendment to prohibit searches of an individual by police officers following a stop for a traffic violation, although there exists no probable cause to beljeve the individual has committed any other legal infraction.\" The Court has held permissible police searches \u00bb CeMuldlg v.

The guarantee of assist\u00ad ance of counsel has been held unavailable to an accused in custody when shuflled through pre-indictment identification procedures, no matter how essential counsel might be to the avoidance of prejudice to his rights at alter stages of the criminal process.\" In addition, the Court has countenanced a state's placing significant bur\u00ad dens\u2014in the form of a \"two-tier\" trial system\u2014on. the constitutional right to trial by jury in criminal cases.\" And in the face of our requirement of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the Court has upheld the permissibility of less than unanimous jury verdicts of guilty.\" Also, a series of decisions iias shaped the doctrines of jurisdiction, justicia\u00ad bility, and remedy, so as increasingly to bar the federal courthouse door in the absence of showings probably impossible to make.\" At the same time, the Younger doctrine lias been extended to allow state oilicinls to block federal court pro\u00ad tection of constitutional rights simply by answering a plaintiff's federal com\u00ad plaint with a state indictment. And tho centuries-old remedy of habeas corpus was so circumscribed last Term ns to weaken drastically its ability to safeguard individuals from invalid imprisonment.'\"' It is true, of course, that there has been an increasing amount of litigation of all types lilling the calendars of virtually every state and federal court. Hut a solution that shuts the courthouse door in the face of the litigant with a legiti\u00ad mate claim for relief, particularly a claim of deprivation of a constitutional right, seems to lie not only the wrong tool but also a dangerous tool for solving the problem.

The very life-blood of courts is popular conlidence Hint thoy mete out evenhanded justice and any discrimination that denies these groups access to the courts for resolution of their meritorious claims unnecessarily risks loss of that confidence. ******* Some state decisions have Indeed suggested a connection between these recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court and the state court's reliance on the state's bill of rights.

In 1073 the United States Supreme Court held that where the subject of a search was not in custody and the prosecution attempts to justify the search by showing the sub\u00ad ject's consent, the prosecution need nut prove that, the subject knew he hail a right to refuse to consent lo llie search.'\" The Court expressly rejected the contention that llie validity of consent to a non-custodial search should be tested by II waiver standard requiring tin; slate to dommisliiite 'Hint the individual consented to the search knowing he did not have to, and that lie intentionally relinquished or abandoned that right. In Utah: v. Julinson,\" Mr. Justice Sullivan writing for New Jersey's high courl, first acknowledged that the United Slates Supreme Court decision was controlling on state courts in construing the fourth amendment and was therefore dispositive of the defendant's federal constitu\u00ad tional argument.0'\" But Sir. Justice Sullivan weal on to consider whether the identically phrased provision of the New Jersey Constitution, Art. I, para. 7, 'should he interpreted to give the individual greater protection than is provided by\" the federal provision.\"\" Counsel had not made this argument either to the triul court or on appeal, but the supreme court, sua xponlc, posed the issue and afforded counsel the opportunity for argument on the question. Mr. .justice Sul\u00ad livan held for the court that, while Art. I, para 7, was in have verba with the fourth amendment and until then hao not been held to impose higher or different standards than the fourth amendment, \"we have the right to construe our state constitutional provision in accordance with what we conceive to be its plain meaning.\"\" That meaning, he went, on to hold, was \"that under Art. I, par. 7 of our State Constitution the validity of u consent to search, even in a non-custodial situation, must he measured in terms of waiver, i.e., where the state seeks to justify a search on the basis of consent it has the burden of show\u00ad ing that the consent was voluntary, an essential element of which is knowledge of the right to refuse consent.\" \u00b08 Among other instances of state courts similarly rejecting United Slates Supreme Court, decisions as unpersunsive, the Hawaii \u00b0\u00b0 and California'\" Supreme Courts have held that searches incident lo lawful arrest are to he tested by a standard of reasonableness rather than automatically validated us incident to arrest; \" the Michigan Supreme Court has held that a suspect, is entitled to the assistance of counsel at any pretrial lineup or photographic identillcation pro\u00ad cedure;'2 and the South Dakota \" and Maine\" Supreme Courts have held that there is a right to trial by jury even for petty offenses.\" Other examples abound where slate courts have independently considered the merits of constitutional arguments mid declined to follow opinions of the United States Supreme Court they find unconvincing, even where the state and federal constitutions are similarly or identically phrased.

For example, the California Su\u00ad preme Court held, as a mailer of stale constitutional law, that bank depositors have a suflicient expectation of privacy in their bank records to invalidate the voluntary disclosure of such records by a bank to the police without I lie knowl\u00ad edge or consent of the depositor ; '\" thereafter the United Slates Supreme Court ruled that federal law was to the contrary.'\" And of course slate courts that rest their decisions wholly or even partly on slate law need not apply federal principles of standing and justiciability that, deny litigants access to the courts. Moreover, the stale decisions not only cannot be overturned by, they indeed are not even reviewable by, the Supreme Court: of the United Slates. We are utterly without jurisdiction to review such stale deci\u00ad sions.\"' This was precisely the circumstance of .Mr. Justice Hall's now famous Alt. Laurel decision,\" which was grounded on the New Jersey Constitution and on stale law. The review sought in that case in the United Slates Supreme Court was, therefore, completely precluded. This pattern of slate court decisions puts to rest the notion thai stale constitu\u00ad tional provisions were adopted to mirror the federal Jtill of Mights. The lesson of history is otherwise ; indeed, the drafters of the federal Hill of Kights drew upon corresponding provisions in the various state constitutions. Trior to the adoption of the federal Constitution, each of the lights eventually recognized in the federal Kill of Itights had previously been projected in one or more state constitutions.'''' And prior to the adoption of the fourteenth amendment, these slate bills of rights, independently interpreted, were the primary restraints on stale action since the federal Hill of Itights had been held inapplicable. The essential point. I am making, of course, is not that the United States Supreme Court is necessarily wrong in its interprelalion of the federal Constitu\u00ad tion, or that ultimate constitutional truths invariably come prepackaged in Hie dissents, including my own, from decisions of the Court. It is simply that (lie decisions of the Court are not, and should not: be, dispositive of questions regard\u00ad ing rights guaranteed by counterpart provisions of slate law.\" Accordingly, such divisions are not: mechanically applicable lo slate law issues, and stale court judges and the members of the bar seriously err if (hey so treat them. Ualher. slate court judges, and also practitioners, do well lo scrutinize constitutional decisions by federal courts, for only If they are found to be logically persuasive and well-reasoned, paying due regard to precedent and the policies underlying specilic constitutional guarantees, may they properly claim persuasive weight as guideposts when interpreting counterpart state guarantees.

And our power Is to correct wrong judgments, not to revise opinions. We are not permitted to render an advisory opinion, and If the same judgment would he rendered hy the state court after we corrected Its views of federal laws, our review could amount to nothing more than an advisory opinion. \"Southern Burlington County NAAC1' v.

Unfortunately, federalism has taken on a new meaning of lute. In its name, many of the door-elosing decisions de\u00ad scribed altovi) have the vague, uiidcllued no\u00ad tions of equity, comity and federalism the Court has condoned both isolated M and systmntiv\" violations of civil liberties. Such decisions hardly bespeak a true con\u00ad cern for equity. Nor do (boy properly understand the nature of our federalism. Adopting the premise that state courts can be trusted to safeguard individual rights.\" the Supreme Court has gone on to limit the protective role of the federal judiciary. Itut in so doing, it has forgotten that one of the strengths of our federal system is that it provides a double source of protection for the rights of our citizens. Federalism is not served when the federal half of that protection-is crippled. Vet, the very premise ot the rases Hint foreclose federal remedies constitutes a clear cull to slate courts to step into the breach. With the federal locus of our double protections weakened, our liberties cannot survive if (he. states betray the trust the Court lias put in lliem. And if that trust is, for the Court, strong enough to override the risk that some states may not live up to it, how much more strongly should we trust slate courts whose manifest purpose is to expand con\u00ad stitutional protections. With federal scrutiny diminished, state courts must re\u00ad spond by increasing their own. Moreover, it is not only state-granted rights that state courts can safeguard. If the Supreme Court insists on limiting the content of due process to the rights created by state law,63 state courts can breathe new life Into the federal due process clause by interpreting their common law, statutes and constitutions to guarantee a \"property\" and \"liberty\" that even the federal courts must protect. Federalism need not be a mean-spirited doctrine that serves only to limit the scope of human liberty. Rather, It must necessarily be furthered significantly when state courts thrust themselves into a position of prominence in the struggle to protect the people of our nation from governmental Intrusions on their freedoms. We can confidently conjecture that James Madison, Father of the Bill of Rights, would have approved. We tend to forget that Madison proposed not ten, but, in the form the House sent them to the Senate, seventeen amendments. The House approved all seventeen including Number XTV\u2014a number of prophetic of things to come with the adoption of Amendment XIV seventy-nine years inter\u2014for Num\u00ad ber XIV would have on the states. Number XIV pro\u00ad vided : \"No State shall infringe the right of trial by jury in criminal cases, nor the right of conscience, nor the freedom of speech or of the press.\" \"* Madison, in u speech to I he House in ITS!), argued that these restrictions on the state power were \"of equal, if not greater, iiiiportence than those already made\"\"0 in the body of the Constitution. There was, be said, more danger of those powers being abused by stale governments than by the government of the United Slates. Indeed, he said, he \"conceived this to he the most valuable amendment in the whole list. Tf there were any reason to restrain the Government of the United States from in\u00ad fringing these essential rights, it was equally necessary that they should be se\u00ad cured against the State governments.\"'\" Rut Number XIV was rejected by Ihe Senate, and Madison's aim was not ac\u00ad complished until adoption of Amendment XIV sevently-niae years later. The rea\u00ad son that Madison placed such store in the effectiveness of the Rill of Rights was his belief that \"independent tribunals of justice will consider themselves in a peculiar manner the guardians of those rights.\"03 His reference was, of course, to his proposed Rill including Number XIV, but we may be confident that he would welcome the broadening by state courts of the reach of state constitutional counterparts beyond the federal model as proof of his conviction that Independent tribunals of justice \"will be naturally led to resist every encroachment upon rights unrosslv stipulated for. . . .\" a \" See Stone v.

O'CONNOR* We live in an imperfect world. Most people would agree our court system suffers from some of that imperfection. We appear to be the only major country with two parallel court systems. Among other things, such an arrangement affords most convicted criminal defendants opportunities for multiple post-conviction appellate court reviews. The labyrinth of judicial reviews of the various stages of a state criminal felony case would appear strange, indeed, to a rational person charged with devising an ideal criminal justice system. Changes and improvements come very slowly, if at all, and, more often than not, incrementally, in small case by case adjustments. State courts, which annually process the great majority of all civil and criminal cases filed in this country, handle their workload for the most part without a great deal of concern about the federal court system which exists alongside them. Trial judges in both sys\u00ad tems are busy hearing cases. Most state court trial judges do not have time to think about what jurisdiction the federal courts should have; they simply take each case assigned and do the best they can with it, whether or not it involves a federal legal question. On the other hand, state appellate court judges occasionally be\u00ad come so frustrated with the extent of federal court intervention that they simply abdicate in favor of the federal jurisdiction. For example, concern in the Supreme Court of Arizona with the extent of the exercise of federal jurisdiction of prisoner complaints led it to refuse to hear any prisoner complaints because of \"preemption of the field\" by the federal courts.1 It is my purpose to comment on some of the trends in the rela\u00ad tionship between the state and federal courts as viewed from the * Judge, Arizona Court of Appeals. A.B., LL.B., Stanford University. 1. Patricella v. Arizona, No. H 650 (Ariz. April 24, 1973). 279 802 WILLIAM AND MARY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 22:801 practical perspective of a state court judge. CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS Application of federal constitutional law by state courts is made most often in state criminal prosecutions. A state criminal defen\u00ad dant gains access to the federal courts by alleging that a violation of the Federal Constitution occurred during the state proceedings. There is seldom a state criminal felony trial in which the defen\u00ad dant is convicted that does not result in an appeal at the state level alleging some federal constitutional error in order to exhaust the state remedies before seeking federal review. As noted by Jus\u00ad tice Powell in his concurring opinion in Rose v. Mitchell: \"Federal constitutional challenges are raised in almost every state criminal case, in part because every lawyer knows that such claims will pro\u00ad vide nearly automatic federal habeas corpus review.\"4 Every state court trial judge realizes, of course, that federal con\u00ad stitutional challenges will be raised in almost every state criminal case and that, after the state appellate review is exhausted, further review will be attempted in the federal courts. As a result, state courts in urban areas have tended to assign certain judges to hear only criminal cases in order that they may become more familiar with applicable state and federal, substantive and procedural, criminal and constitutional law. In addition, the National Center for State Courts, the Institute of Judicial Administration, and the National Judicial College continually offer assistance to courts and to state judges on various aspects of how they can appropriately function within the state and federal constitutional parameters. There is a keen awareness among state court judges in state crimi\u00ad nal cases of the federal constitutional protections of the defendant. With the election of President Reagan, there is no reason to think the recent trend in the United States Supreme Court shift\u00ad ing to the state courts some additional responsibility for determi\u00ad nation of federal constitutional questions in state criminal cases will not continue. As stated by Charles Whitebread: [T]he Warren Court, which was extremely energetic in ex\u00ad panding the scope of federal constitutional claims open to state 2. 443 U.S. 545, 581 (1979) (Powell. J., concurring). 280 1981] COMMENTARY 803, prisoners, seemed to act on the premise that the state courts could not be depended upon to vindicate these newly created rights. Thus, it forged new law on the procedural as well as sub\u00ad stantive front by providing greater access to federal court for state defendants. Federal habeas corpus became the principal remedy through which the newly created rights could be as\u00ad serted and protected. By contrast, as the Burger Court has lim\u00ad ited the substantive federal constitutional rights of the state criminal defendant, it has simultaneously reduced dramatically the avenues available for state prisoner access to the lower fed\u00ad eral courts.8 A recent example of the increased reluctance of the United States Supreme Court to overturn by federal habeas corpus pro\u00ad ceedings state court determinations in criminal cases is found in Sumner v. Mata* The Court in Sumner held that a federal court that grants federal habeas corpus relief to a state criminal defen\u00ad dant is required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) to presume the state appel\u00ad late or trial court's factual findings are correct and to explain the reasons for determining that the state court's findings were not fairly supported by the record. The majority opinion states: \"Fed\u00ad eral habeas has been a source of friction between state and federal courts and Congress obviously meant to alleviate some of that fric\u00ad tion when it enacted subsection (d) in 1966 as an amendment to the original Federal Habeas Act of 1867.\"6 The response of state courts to the trend toward some restriction of review of state criminal cases by federal habeas corpus is ex\u00ad plored in an article by A.E. Dick Howard.8 Professor Howard con\u00ad cludes that in the area of criminal procedure, most state court9 show \"an inertial tendency simply to follow the . . . federal deci\u00ad sions\" because of the deference owed to the United States Su\u00ad preme Court or the desirability of uniformity of state and federal law.7 However, he details examples of a number of state courts 3.

REV. 489 (1977). 281 804 WILLIAM AND MARY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 22:801 which have relied upon their own state constitutions as a means of defining rights of criminal defendants more broadly than do the federal couits.8 In the next decade, there will probably be significant additional state court variations in cases involving the issue of illegal search and seizure under the fourth amendment. Since Stone v. Powell,9 state criminal defendants who have had a \"full and fair opportu\u00ad nity\" to raise their claims of illegal search and seizure in the state courts may not, thereafter, obtain federal habeas corpus relief. We do not yet know the tests to be employed in determining what is a \"full and fair opportunity.\" However, assuming the state courts are providing a full and fair opportunity for the claims to be raised, and that federal habeas corpus review is unavailable, the state courts are more likely than their federal counterparts to reach widely varying results on search and seizure issues. Even the fed\u00ad eral cases on search and seizure are not models of clarity and sim\u00ad plicity. The standards tend to be confusing and obtuse in some instances.10 One area where federal court review of state courts' determina\u00ad tions of federal constitutional questions may be expected to in\u00ad crease, however, is the area of state criminal defendants' waiver of their constitutional objections. State criminal defendants seeking habeas corpus relief in the federal court must raise their constitu\u00ad tional objections in a timely fashion in the state proceedings, or they will be held to have waived their claim for relief, absent a showing of cause why the objection was not raised and also a show\u00ad ing of actual prejudice.\" We can expect a number of petitions to be filed for habeas corpus relief to test the extent to which failure 8.

Competence of coun\u00ad sel may be relevant to the determination of good cause and of prejudice.1* Closely related to the question of waiver of the constitutional issue at the state level is the question of competence of counsel as a ground for collateral attack on state convictions on the basis of the sixth amendment. This issue is one which will undoubtedly, be raised very frequently during the next few years. At present, it is the single issue raised most frequently in Arizona appellate courts in petitions for post-conviction relief in criminal cases.18 The United States Supreme Court has held that counsel must render legal services \"within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.\"\" This standard is far from definitive. No doubt the range of competence varies somewhat from commu\u00ad nity to community and from state to state. The older test of whether the proceedings were a \"farce and mockery of justice\" has been rejected in all but three of the federal circuits.1* The other circuits have developed differing standards for determining the competence of counsel.18 The majority follow a \"reasonable compe- 12. See Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 94-96 (1977) (Stevens, J., concurring). 13. Seventy-five petitions for appellate post-conviction relief in criminal cases were /i!e<? in Arizona in 1980. Of these, twenty-seven, or 36%, raised the issue of competence of coun\u00ad sel. Letter from John Sticht, Staff Attorney, Arizona Court of Appeals to Judge Sandra D. O'Connor, Arizona Court of Appeals (Feb. 25, 1981). Direct appeals from state criminal convictions frequently involve an allegation that there was a failure at trial to raise a defense, to make an evidentiary objection, or to request a jury instruction. Unless the failure resulted in \"fundamental error,\" the state appellate court will ordinarily affirm the conviction. See, e.g., State v. Workman, 123 Ariz. 501, 600 P.2d 1133 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1979); Bell v. State, 598 S.W.2d 738 (Ark. 1980); People v. Means, 97 Mich. App. 641, 296 N.W.2d 14 (1980); State v. Moon, Ct. App. People v. 1980); State v. Foddrell, 269 S.E.2d 854 (W.

In view of the conflicting holdings in the federal appellate courts, the Su\u00ad preme Court may accept jurisdiction and attempt to establish a more definite standard. It is also likely that some strain may be felt by some state courts as their determinations of attorney com\u00ad petence are reviewed in the federal courts. CIVIL CASES Although the present trend in federal review of state criminal matters appears to be to restrict some of the federal jurisdiction, quite the reverse trend seems to be occurring in civil cases, both by federal judicial decisions and by congressional action. Although not arising as frequently as in the criminal area, federal constitutional law, as it applies to state legislative and executive action, is per\u00ad haps of more concern to state courts in terms of forcing significant decisions to be made in cases of great public interest. We have seen recently examples of acute confrontations between federal district courts and state courts in school busing and school deseg\u00ad regation cases.

Confusion exists among students of the subject concerning the meaning and import of the Supreme Court decisions on prejudgment creditors' rights and remedies.30 The subject of creditors' rights is surely one of the subjects most often addressed in state courts on a continuing basis. It is apparent that we have not heard the end of the matter from a federal constitutional perspective, and that the federal courts will continue to issue additional opinions defining the validity of vari\u00ad ous state laws on the subject. Another area of recent contact and some confusion between the state and federal courts is in medical malpractice cases in some states.

When the malpractice suit is filed in a federal court under its diversity jurisdiction, the federal courts are divided on whether they must follow the state's review procedure when that procedure is to be implemented after the lawsuit is filed.32 The issue focuses on whether the federal court in a diversity suit must apply the sub\u00ad stantive law of the forum state as required by Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins,33 and thereby discourage forum shopping,34 or whether the federal court should refuse to apply the state law because it would violate an important federal policy or would \"alter the es\u00ad sential character or function of [the] federal court.\"35 Where the state law requires submission to a state review or mediation panel before the lawsuit is filed, the federal cases uniformly appear to dismiss the federal action if the state prefiling procedure is not fol\u00ad lowed.38 As states attempt to control more of the tort litigation by arbitration and other devices, we can anticipate more confusion and confrontation with federal courts on whether the state proce\u00ad dures must be followed in the diversity cases. The next decade is also likely to see continued expansion of liti\u00ad gation in the federal courts under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983,37 the civil rights statute, unless Congress decides to limit the availability of relief under that statute.

It could be accom\u00ad plished either directly, or indirectly by limiting or disallowing re\u00ad covery of attorneys' fees. Such a move would be welcomed by state courts, as well as state legislatures and executive officers. In fact, however, Congress appears to have moved recently to open further the federal jurisdictional doors. In the closing days of the 96th Congress, the $10,000.00 amount in controversy requirement was totally eliminated for federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.\" The elimination of the amount in controversy require\u00ad ment may have been prompted by the fact that there is no amount in controversy requirement for section 1983 actions filed under the jurisdictional statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(a)(3).46 For claims arising under the Constitution or a federal statute securing equal rights, plaintiffs wishing to file in federal court were able to simply couch their complaints in terms of section 1343(a)(3) rather than section 1331. Regardless of the reasons, Congress has expanded the juris\u00ad diction of the federal courts by the amendment to section 1331. Congress has also added to the scope of federal court jurisdiction in the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978.47 The Act gives the federal district courts \"original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising ... in or related to\" the debtor in a Title 11 proceeding.48 Starting in 1984, that jurisdiction will be exercised by the new bankruptcy courts.49 Effectively, then, this broad grant of 45.

For example, in Maricopa County, Arizona, there were 4,462 petitions in bankruptcy filed in 1980.\" It is estimated that in the Maricopa County Superior Court of Arizona alone there are already 186 pending cases which have been stayed because one of the parties is involved in a federal bankruptcy proceeding.55 Another area of federal civil case jurisdiction which Congress may exammine in the next few years is the diversity jurisdiction.

Let us examine the ar\u00ad guments made to justify the conclusion that federal judges are pre\u00ad ferred. First, it is argued that federal judges are better paid and have more prestige.57 It is certainly true that most federal judges are better paid.88 However, the higher pay does not necessarily at\u00ad tract only the most competent lawyers to the federal bench. Often political considerations are more important than pure competence in the appointing process. In addition, many appointments to the federal bench are made from state court benches.*9 When the state court judge puts on his or her new federal court robe he or she does not become immediately better equipped intellectually to do the job. Second, it is said that life tenure insulates the judge from majoritarian pressure, and, therefore, the federal judges are more receptive to controversial principles.60 In twenty states, however, 57. See, e.g., Neuborne, The Myth of Parity, 90 HARV. L. REV. 1105, 1121, 1124-27 (1977). 58. From March 1977 to December 31, 1980, yearly salaries for federal district judges were $54,500 and for federal circuit judges, $57,500. United States v. Will, 101 S. Ct. 471, 476 (1980). Beginning January 1, 1981, yearly salaries for federal district judges are $67,100 and for circuit judges, $70,900. 67 A.B.A.J. 162, 165 (1981). As of January 31, 1979, the national average salary for associate justices (excluding chief justices) of the highest state courts was $45,248; for state intermediate appellate court judges, $45,278; and for general trial court judges, $38,971, U.S. DEP'T OF JUSTICE, LAW EN\u00ad FORCEMENT ASSISTANCE ADMINISTRATION, AND NATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE INFORMATION AND STATISTICS SERVICE, SOURCEBOOK OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE STATISTICS - 1979 110, Table 1.57 (1980) [hereinafter cited as 1979 SOURCEBOOK]. However, the average salaries of state trial court judges increased by more than 90% be\u00ad tween 1969 and 1980, while the salaries of federal courts of appeals and district court judges increased by less than 40% during the same period. 67 A.B.A.J. 162,164 (1981). And certain state judges receive salaries fax higher than the averages given above. For instance, the chief justice of the state of California now receives $77,409 a year, and the chief judge of the highest New York court, the court of appeals, receives $75,000 a year. Id. 59. A study of characteristics of presidential nominees and appointees to United States court judgeships from 1963 to August 27, 1978, broken down by presidential administration, reveals that percentages of nominees who at the time of their nomination or appointment were employed by the judiciary ranged from 28.5% under President Nixon to 42.2% under President Carter. In addition, percentages of nominees with prior judicial experience ranged from 34.3% under President Johnson to 46.7% under President Carter. 1979 SOURCEBOOK, supra note 58, at 115, Table 1.60. 60. See, e.g., Neuborne, supra note 54, at 1105, 1127-28. 290 1981] COMMENTARY ^ we now have merit selection of state judges rather than popufar elections.91 These judges are relatively safe and secure in their po\u00ad sitions. Even those state judges who are elected often have reason\u00ad ably long terms of office.\" I have seen remarkable examples of the exercise of courage and judicial independence by state court judges. Third, it is argued that federal judges will be more receptive to federal constitutional claims. Professor Bator has answered this ar\u00ad gument quite well in his article published in this issue.93 What is really being said is that federal judges are inclined to be more re\u00ad ceptive to some federal constitutional claims. Professor Bator is correct in stating what is required is a sensitivity and responsive\u00ad ness to all the constitutional principles, not just some of them.6' There is no reason to assume that state court judges cannot and will not provide a \"hospitable forum\" in litigating federal constitu\u00ad tional questions. As stated by Justice William H. Rehnquist in a recent opinion: State judges as well as federal judges swear allegiance to the Constitution of the United States, and there is no reason to, think that because of their frequent differences of opinions as to how that document should be interpreted that all are not doing their mortal best to discharge their oath of office.\" The allegations concerning relative competency and judicial mindset are essentially subjective impressions not subject to con\u00ad firmation in fact. Perhaps even the subjective impressions of law\u00ad yers are changing. In a recent survey conducted by Justice James Duke Cameron of the Arizona Supreme Court, attorneys in ten; ju\u00ad risdictions, at various locations throughout the United States, were asked certain questions as they filed civil actions in the state courts.66 The attorneys were asked to state the nature of the action filed, their preference for the court, state or federal, for filing the 61.

Two hundred and fifty-two lawyers responded. One hundred and ninety-three law\u00ad yers stated they preferred to file in the state court, and thirty-four stated they preferred to file in a federal court. Of those preferring the federal court, the reasons most often given were a superior pro\u00ad cedure, better judges, and quicker disposition of cases. Of the ma\u00ad jority preferring to file in state courts, the reasons most often given were a quicker disposition of cases, familiarity with the state court, and convenience. In general, a majority of lawyers responding to the questionnaire indicated they perceived no difference in the quality of judges between the federal and state courts. The results indicate that the lawyers who responded saw no great difference in the quality of judges or justice between the state and federal courts. Another indication that attorneys do not perceive substantial differences in the quality of judges in the state and federal courts can be found in the bar association polls taken in jurisdictions hav\u00ad ing a merit selection system for judges. For example, in Arizona's most recent bar poll, both the state and federal judges were rated on a variety of qualifications. The overall results varied in Mari\u00ad copa County, Arizona, from a low rating of sixty-three percent for the federal district court judges to a high rating of ninety-seven percent and from a low rating of sixty percent for the state court judges to a high rating of ninety-nine percent.67 CONCLUSION If our nation's bifurcated judicial system is to be retained, as I am sure it will be, it is clear that we should strive to make both the federal and the state systems strong, independent, and viable. State courts will undoubtedly continue in the future to litigate fed\u00ad eral constitutional questions. State judges in assuming office take an oath to support the federal as well as the state constitution. State judges do in fact rise to the occasion when given the respon\u00ad sibility and opportunity to do so. It is a step in the right direction to defer to the state courts and give finality to their judgments on 67. 15 ARIZ. B.J. (August 1980) (Newsletter). 292 1981] COMMENTARY 855 federal constitutional questions where a full and fair adjudication has been given in the state court. The jurisdiction of state courts to decide federal constitutional questions cannot be removed by congressional action, whereas the federal court jurisdiction can be shaped or removed by Congress.68 Proposals are sometimes made to restrict federal court jurisdiction over certain types of cases or issues. Among the proposals which have merit from the perspective of a state court judge are the elim\u00ad ination or restriction of federal court diversity jurisdiction, and a requirement of exhaustion of state remedies as a prerequisite to bringing a federal action under section 1983. If we are serious about strengthening our state courts and improving their capacity to deal with federal constitutional issues, then we will not allow a race to the courthouse to determine whether an action will be heard first in the federal or state court. We should allow the state courts to rule first on the constitutionality of state statutes. At both the state and federal levels, efforts should continue to be made to improve the judicial selection processes, and to provide adequate and appropriate training for those selected. The states should, in my view, adopt procedural rules which are generally pat\u00ad terned after the federal rules of criminal and civil procedure, and evidentiary rules which are the same or parallel to the federal rules of evidence. In this way perhaps parity will become less a myth and more a reality. 68. U.S. CONST, art. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2; Ex parte McCardle, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 506 (1869); Sheldon v.

Abrahamson Justice, Wisconsin Supreme Court IAM honored to have been selected to deliver the Fifth Annual Roy R. Ray Lecture, named in honor of Professor Emeritus Roy R. Ray of this faculty, and to have the opportunity to speak with the faculty, students, and alumni of this distinguished university. I speak today of a subject near and dear to me\u2014state courts. 1 have been sitting on the highest court of the State of Wisconsin for six years, and I am eligible to sit for another twenty-two years. I have pondered long and hard about how to present state courts to you. My law clerk gave me what he considered sage advice. He said I should remember to be neither partial on the one hand nor impartial on the other. The title of my lecture is, as you know, \"Reincarnation of State Courts.\" The word reincarnation, like most words, has several meanings and us\u00ad ages. The one I use is that of a \"rebirth.\" A major theme of this lecture is that in the 1980s there will, I believe, be a \"rebirth\" of the state courts, a rebirth in the sense of a renewed recognition of the significance of the work of the state courts. In the past three decades, when mention was made of courts, both the legal and academic communities and the public thought of federal courts. The 1980s will be the decade of the state courts. I think by the end of the 1980s a lawyer or academician might look at the state courts and say, \"You've come a long way. Baby.\" The state courts have always been important, but it's taken some people in the legal world, including the state judges themselves, a long time to recognize this fact. I deliberately chose to use the word reincarnation rather than the word rebirth so that I could conjure up the image of old concepts returning to the earth in new forms. The old concepts to which I refer are two recur\u00ad ring themes in American legal history, states' rights and individual rights.1 Both states' rights and individual rights predate the founding of this coun- * This Article is a revised and annotated version of the lecture delivered at Southern Methodist University School of Law, Dallas, Texas, March 5, 1982.

These two concepts return in the 1980s in new forms, called \"new federalism\" or \"recycled federalism.\"2 In judicial jargon new federalism describes a growing awareness in the state courts of the importance of state law, especially state constitutional law, as the basis for the protection of individual rights against state government. New federalism describes the willingness of state courts to assert themselves as the final arbiters in ques\u00ad tions of their citizens' individual rights by relying on their own law, espe\u00ad cially the state constitutions. New federalism is based on the premise that the federal Constitution establishes minimum, rather than maximum, guarantees of individual rights and that, in appropriate cases, state courts should independently determine, according to their own law (generally their own state constitutions), the degree to which individual rights will be protected within the state jurisdiction. Independent interpretation of the state's own constitution is part of the double security of having both fed\u00ad eral and state bills of rights. Legal literature has used the term new federalism to refer to the rela\u00ad tionship of the federal and state courts before President Reagan popular\u00ad ized the term in his 1980 campaign. President Reagan proposes, as you know, decentralizing governmental activities so that many federally legis\u00ad lated and administered programs will be established and maintained by the states and localities. President Reagan's proposals have engendered intensive discussions about the proper alignment of power between the central government and the states. You will soon realize that many of the arguments relating to Reagan's new federalism have counterparts in my discussion of new federalism for the judicial branch. In the 1980s it may very well be the state siipreme court, not the United States Supreme Court, that will be the significant constitutional law court. And the state supreme court will be looking to its own law; it will be inter\u00ad preting the state constitution, not the United States Constitution. My theme then is the emerging role of state courts in relation to the federal courts and the emerging role of state law, especially state constitu\u00ad tional law, in relation to federal constitutional law. In law school it is customary to use hypotheticals. I will follow prece\u00ad dent. Suppose that University Park, the municipality in which Southern Methodist University is located, has an ordinance requiring every speaker in the community who will address an audience of more than fifty persons to submit the text of his or her speech twenty-four hours in advance of the speech to obtain a license for the public gathering. I think you all recog\u00ad nize that this ordinance is in trouble. Let us suppose that the year is 1921, the tenth anniversary of the founding of Southern Methodist University, and I am here to speak on that occasion. What provision of law protects my right to speak? If your answer is the first amendment to the federal Constitution you are 2. \"I detect a phoenix-like resurrection of federalism, or, if you prefer, states' rights, evidenced by state courts' reliance upon provisions of state constitutions.\" Mosk, The Slate Courts, in AMERICAN LAW\u2014THE THIRD CENTURY 216 (B.

Although in the early part of the twentieth century a minority of Justices of the United States Supreme Court were pressing for recognition of free expression as a fundamental freedom guaranteed by the federal Constitution against state action, these Justices were the minority.3 Hav\u00ad ing the dissenting Justices on your side doesn't mean you're right, nor does it mean you're wrong. It does mean, however, that you lose. In 1921 I, the speaker, was not protected by the federal Constitution. I was nevertheless protected by article I, section 8, of the Texas Constitution, which guarantees that \"(e)very person shall be at liberty to speak, write or publish his opinions on any subject.\"4 The freedom of speech and press provision of the Texas Constitution differs from the text of the first amend\u00ad ment.1 In 1921 you and I would go to the Texas trial court to seek the protection of my rights under the state constitution. Now suppose this was the year 1969, the forty-fourth anniversary of the founding of this law school. Here I am again, and University Park has, in the Vietnam years, reenacted its former ordinance. What provisions of law protect my right to speak? If this were 1969 you'd answer, without hesita\u00ad tion, the first amendment to the federal Constitution. This time you would be right. The dissenters obviously got some votes. And we would then be faced with the issue of what court to go to, state or federal. You and I could still go to the Texas trial court to seek protection of my rights under the federal Constitution. Remember that the state courts have the power, indeed the duty, to enforce the federal Constitution and federal law. The Texas judges take an oath, as I do, to support the federal Constitution. Article VI of the federal Constitution provides: \"This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof . . . shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\" 3. See Gilbert v. Minnesota, 254 U.S. 325, 343 (1920) (Brandeis, J., dissenting); Patter\u00ad son v. Colorado, 205 U.S. 454, 465 (1907) (Harlan, J., dissenting). In Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. v. Cheek, 259 U.S. 530, 543 (1922), the Court stated that \"neither the Fourteenth Amendment nor any other provision of the Constitution of the United States imposes upon the States any restrictions about 'freedom of speech'. . . .\" 4. TEX. CONST, art. I, \u00a7 8, provides: Every person shall be at liberty to speak, write or publish his opinions on any subject, being responsible for the abuse of that privilege; and no law shall ever be passed curtailing the liberty of speech or of the press. In prosecutions for the publication of papers, investigating the conduct of officers, or men in pub\u00ad lic capacity, or when the matter published is proper for public information, the truth thereof may be given in evidence. And in all indictments for libels, the jury shall have the right to determine the law and the facts, under the direction of the court, as in other cases. 5. The first amendment states: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establish\u00ad ment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Govern\u00ad ment for a redress of grievances.\" U.S. CONST, amend.

We would probably have gone to the federal district court, believ\u00ad ing it to be a more receptive forum for preservation of individual rights than is the state trial court. Now it is 1982 and I have returned, older but not really surprised at my advanced age to find again that University Park has recently adopted a similar ordinance. Old fights don't stay won. What provision of law pro\u00ad tects my right to speak in 1982? If you are a good constitutional lawyer your answer should be that my rights are doubly protected, protected by the Texas Constitution and protected by the federal Constitution. You might say we should talk about which constitution we want to rely upon. And now in 1982 we will again face the question of whether to go to fed\u00ad eral or to state court. In my hypothetical, the facts are the same in 1921, 1969, and 1982. The University Park ordinance, the Texas Constitution, and the United States Constitution are the same in 1921, 1969, and 1982. Yet the answers to the same question have changed. Why? This hypothetical reminds me of my teaching federal income tax at the University of Wisconsin Law School. I gave the same exam each year; I just changed the answers. To understand the 1921, 1969, and 1982 answers to my ordinance hypothetical, let's go back to our two themes\u2014states' rights and individual rights. We'll talk about states' rights first. I use the terms states' rights and federalism interchangeably. Both refer to the division of power between the central authority and the constituent jurisdictions. Throughout most of our country's history fundamentally different views have persisted about the nature of the American government: Is it a federal or national system? A federal system of government is one formed by the confederacy of sev\u00ad eral states that retain residual powers of government. In contrast to a fed\u00ad eral government, a national government is a union of people under a single sovereign government. In 1787, when the federal Constitution was drafted, a decision had to be made whether there would be a compact among state sovereignties or a union of the whole people. The decision was never made. Our Constitu\u00ad tion is a compromise. Madison described the new government as partly national, partly federal.6 Our founding fathers left us with two governments, state and federal\u2014 two governments governing the same people in the same geographic terri\u00ad tory. In addition to the division of powers between the federal and state governments, we have delegated the legislative, executive, and judicial functions to three separate branches of government. Thus we live in a country with a dual court system, federal and state, operating side by side. Conflict is endemic in the system. When we talk of new federalism, judi\u00ad cial federalism, we talk of the respective spheres of federal and state courts. 6. Madison, The Federalist No. 39, in THE ENDURING FEDERALIST 164-68 (C. Beard ed. 1948). 297 1982] STATE COURTS 955 The framers thought these conflicts could be tolerated, and the framers relied upon these conflicts to operate as checks and balances on the power of the governments. Setting up a government with these internal conflicts illustrates colonial America's distrust of government, and leads me to the second theme: individual rights. Protection of individual rights by a formal constitution starts with the state constitutions, which predate the federal Constitution. Between 1776 and 1784 each of the original thirteen states adopted its own constitution,' which asserted the principle that citizens' individual liberties were to be protected against government action. Formal bills of rights were part of many of the colonial charters and revolutionary declarations and constitu\u00ad tions.7 During the months preceding independence, uniformity of state constitutions was debated but rejected in favor of the states calling conven\u00ad tions to draw up constitutions satisfactory to the respective states. Diver\u00ad sity was the politically realistic answer.8 From an historical standpoint state constitutions have a real signifi\u00ad cance. The draftsmen of the federal Constitution used the state constitu\u00ad tions and state experience as models for the federal Constitution. Strange as it seems, states formed after the drafting of the federal Constitution did not look to it as a model for their own constitutions. They looked to their territorial framework of government (like the Northwest Ordinance) or to the constitutions of their sister states. Thus the 1848 Wisconsin Constitution, which is Wisconsin's first and only constitution, was patterned after the New York Constitution, because the Wisconsin Constitution was adopted by a convention in which New Yorkers were prominent.9 The present Texas Constitution dates back to 1876 and is the eighth constitution of this state.10 The 1876 Texas constitution was based on the 1845 constitution and the constitutions of other states, particularly Penn\u00ad sylvania and Louisiana.\" Although the state constitutions had bills of rights, the federal Constitu\u00ad tion as originally drafted in 1787 had no bill of rights, no list of protections of individual rights.

The 1824 Constitution of the Republic of Mexico recognized Coahuila and Texas as a single stale and provided that each state should frame its own constitulion. The stale of Coahuila and Texas published a constitution in 1827. In 1832 Texas drew up a separate state constitution, which was not approved by the Mexican Congress. In 1836 the Republic of Texas adopted its own constitution. Texas was admitted to the Union with the constitu\u00ad tion of 1845. In 1861 Texas amended its constitution to reflect Texas's transfer of allegiance. After the civil war a convention drafted and the voters approved the constitution of 1866. In 1869 the 1868 or Reconstruction Constitution was ratified by voters. In 1876 the present constitution was ratified by the voters. See 1 TEX. CONST. ANN. preamble (Vernon 1955); 2 C.

ANN. preamble (Vernon 1955). 298 956 SOUTHWESTERN LAW JOURNAL [Vol.36 Constitution, was adopted by Congress on September 25, 1789, and rati\u00ad fied on December 15. 1791. ' It was assumed at adoption that the Bill of Rights would limit only the federal government's exercise of power. There was no need to limit the states; the state constitutions did that. The assumption that the eight amendments limited only the federal government became constitutional doctrine in 1833 in the case of Barron v. Mayor of Baltimore, an opinion written by Chief Justice John Marshall. It was the Civil War amendments to the Constitution, the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth amendments, that wrote into the Constitution broad new guarantees of liberty and equality by which the federal govern\u00ad ment committed itself to protect citizens against states. Nationalism was the spirit of the Civil War. Not long after the passage of the fourteenth amendment, however, it was argued in the Slaughter-House Cases of 187213 that the fourteenth amend\u00ad ment had the effect of blanketing in the original -Bill of Rights as limita\u00ad tions upon state action. The United States Supreme Court rejected this theory. It refused to say that the fourteenth amendment protected a Loui\u00ad siana butcher from a state-created monopoly in slaughtering. It was not until 1925 in Gitlow v. New York14 that the United States Supreme Court in a dictum recognized that the free speech guarantees of the first amendment applied to the states as a result of the fourteenth amendment.15 Thus for most of the history of this country\u2014namely, for 138 years, from 1787 to 1925 (the date of the founding of this law school)\u2014the fed\u00ad eral Bill of Rights offered citizens little or no protection in their relations with the state and local governments. The individual state constitutions offered them those protections. Armed with state law and the state constitution, and operating in an area that received little or no federal attention, the state courts could con\u00ad tribute to the development of preservation of freedom of expression and other rights guaranteed by the states' constitutions. From 1787 to 1925 the state constitution, not the federal Constitution, was the primary source of protection of individual rights. Remember, in 1921 when I came to Uni\u00ad versity Park, I was protected by only the state constitution. 12. 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 242(1833). 13. 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 36 (1872). 14. 268 U.S. 652(1925). 15. In Gitlow the Court said: For present purposes we may and do assume that freedom of speech and of the press\u2014which are protected by the First Amendment from abridgement by Congress\u2014are among the fundamental personal rights and \"liberties\" pro\u00ad tected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from impair\u00ad ment by the States. 268 U.S. at 666. In later cases the Supreme Court viewed Gitlow as settling the issue that the first amendment applied to the states through the fourteenth amendment. See, e.g., Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359, 368 (1931); Fiske v.. Kansas, 274 U.S. 380, 386-87 (1927); Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357, 371 (1927). 299 1982] STATE COURTS 957 The states' records in preserving individual rights in the years from 1787 to 1925 are not uniform within each state or from state to state. Some states, in some areas, have records of which they can be proud. In the area of appointment of counsel for indigent criminal defendants at public ex\u00ad pense, the states' records are good, far ahead of the federal government's record. In 1859 the Wisconsin Supreme Court in Carpenter v. Dane County,xt as a matter of its own state constitutional law, required counties to appoint counsel for indigent felons at county expense. It was not until 1963, 104 years after the Wisconsin Supreme Court had acted, that the United States Supreme Court required, as a matter of fourteenth amendment due proc\u00ad ess, a state to provide counsel in state felony trials.17 By the time the United States Supreme Court imposed this requirement, most states ap\u00ad pointed counsel at public expense, as called for by state constitutions, state laws, or state practice. In Gideon v. Wainwright the United States Supreme Court was bringing the few laggards into line.18 In other areas of individual rights the states' records are sorry ones in\u00ad deed. And many have said that the states' failure to protect individual rights in this period created a void, and voids, as you know, are generally filled.\" After Gitlow in 1925 the United States Supreme Court started filling the void. The year 1925 marks the end of the first stage of federalism and the beginning of the second stage. After 1925 the United States Supreme Court adopted the rationale that certain aspects of the Bill of Rights were so necessary to an ordered scheme of liberty that it was reasonable to con\u00ad clude that they were encompassed within the fourteenth amendment and therefore were applicable to the states. The process of absorption began. As late as 1961, only twenty years ago, less than a handful of the twenty- four or twenty-five specific rights of the first eight amendments to the fed\u00ad eral Constitution were held to be absorbed into the fourteenth amendment and applicable to the states. From 1961 to about 1970, however, the United States Supreme Court made many, but not all, of the provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states. In a decade, the 1960s, the four\u00ad teenth amendment was used to impose national standards of fair proce\u00ad dure and equal treatment on states and localities. As the federal constitutional guarantees grew during the Warren Court years, the protection of individual rights under the state constitutions al\u00ad most came to a halt. In the 1960s the United States Supreme Court went faster and probably farther than many of the state courts were willing to go. Not inclined to take the lead, state courts followed, some reluctantly, the lead of the United States Supreme Court. During the 1960s most law- 16. 9 Wis. 274, 278 (1859). 17. Gideon v.

They did not examine the state constitution to determine whether it afforded the same or greater rights.20 The 1960s was the zenith of the second period of federalism and individual rights. The emphasis was on the central government. You remember that when I spoke in University Park in 1969 we viewed my rights as protected by the first amendment. In the 1970s we find new faces on the United States Supreme Court bench. In 1976 the New York Times would write: There was a time not so far distant when the United States Supreme Court was the staunch and ultimate defender of civil rights and liber\u00ad ties .... [T]he Court [now] seems clearly to be beating a retreat from its once proud forward position in this delicate and difficult area of the relationship between citizen and state.21 I am not sure that there has been such a retreat. Certainly some decisions since 1970 have been highly protective of citizens' rights against both state and federal action. Nevertheless, Justice Brennan, writing in the Harvard Law Review in the spring of 1977, pointed out what he and others saw as two significant changes in the United States Supreme Court and its atti\u00ad tude toward individual rights.22 First, Justice Brennan and others saw a retrenchment of the Supreme Court from its aggressive position in protect\u00ad ing the rights of citizens against both state and federal encroachments;23 second, they saw the conscious barring of the door to federal courthouses by procedural devices to limit adjudication of claims against state action.24 In the 1960s Justice Brennan spoke of the Bill of Rights as the primary source of constitutional liberty.25 In the 1970s Justice Brennan repeatedly urged slate courts to look to their own constitutions and to become a new \"font of individual liberties.\"26 20.

Justice Brennan continued: The essential point 1 am making, of course, is not that the United States Supreme Court is necessarily wrong in its interpretation of the federal Consti\u00ad tution, or that ultimate constitutional truths invariably come prepackaged in the dissents, including my own, from decisions of the Court. It is simply that the decisions of the Court are not, and should not be, dispositive of questions regarding rights guaranteed by counterpart provisions of state law. Accord\u00ad ingly, such decisions are not mechanically applicable to state law issues, and state court judges and the members of the bar seriously err if they so treat them. Rather, state court judges, and also practitioners, do well to scrutinize constitutional decisions by federal courts, for only if they are found to be logi\u00ad cally persuasive and well-reasoned, paying due regard to precedent and the 301 1982] STATE COURTS 959 Personally. I do not view the United States Supreme Court develop\u00ad ments in the 1970s as the result of ill motives or a conscious desire to limit individual rights. The present may be a time for the Court to digest the changes and fill in the details of earlier doctrine, rather than break new ground. There are good reasons for limiting access to the federal courts when their procedures duplicate fair and constitutionally sufficient state court procedures. Redundant procedures exhaust judge power, a precious and limited commodity, and may have the effect of limiting or diluting the quality of justice for all litigants. In any event, the purpose of this speech is neither to praise nor to condemn either the Warren or the Burger Court. It is clear, in view of the recent decisional trends of the United States Supreme Court, that litigants will become more and more dependent upon their state courts in matters of civil liberties than they have in the recent past. Thus, in the 1980s we reach the third stage of the interrelation of federalism and individual rights. Once again we look to state courts and state constitutions. But there is a difference. In the 1980s, unlike pre-1925, the federal Constitution is a federal safety net for the protection of individ\u00ad ual rights. Thus, in 1982 when I speak in University Park and worry about the ordinance, 1 have double security for my rights\u2014both the federal and state constitutions. Let us move from my hypothetical free speech case to an actual case in the 1970s involving the individual's protection against unreasonable search and seizure. I speak of Texas v. White?1 Mr. White was arrested by Amarillo police officers while he was attempting to pass fraudulent checks. He was taken to the police station and questioned. Although he refused to consent to have his auto searched, the police conducted a search and seized four wrinkled checks that corresponded to those he had attempted to pass. The fourth amendment to the United States Constitution protects individ- policies underlying specific constitutional guarantees, may they properly claim persuasive weight as guideposts when interpreting counterpart state guaran\u00ad tees. I suggest to the bar that, although in the past it might have been safe for counsel to raise only federal constitutional issues in state courts, plainly it would be most unwise these days not also to raise the state constitutional questions.

The 1969 report of the Virginia Commission on Constitutional Revision noted the impor\u00ad tance of the Virginia Bill of Rights as follows: That most of the provisions of the Virginia Bill of Rights have their parallel in the Federal Bill of Rights is, in the judgment of the Commission, no good reason not to look first to Virginia's Constitution for the safeguards of the fundamental rights of Virginians. The Commission believes that the Vir\u00ad ginia Bill of Rights should be a living and operating instrument of government and should, by stating the basic safeguards of the people's liberties, minimize the occasion for Virginians to resort to the Federal Constitution and to the federal courts. 1969 REPORT OF THE COMM'N ON CONSTITUTIONAL REVISION, part III, at 86; see also Countryman, Why a State Bill of Rights?, 45 WASH.

Article I, section 9 of the Texas Constitution, in language almost identical to that of the fourth amendment of the United States Constitution, prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. The Texas trial court found the search reasonable under the fourth amendment. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that the warrant\u00ad less search of the automobile violated the fourth amendment, but made no reference to the Texas Constitution or statutes.28 The United States Supreme Court reversed the Texas court, saying the Texas court was wrong in its interpretation of the fourth amendment and the prior United States Supreme Court cases.29 The Court sent the case back to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.30 What does this tell us? It tells us that if the state court incorrectly predicts what the United States Supreme Court will do, the state court gets reversed. Justice Thurgood Marshall dissented on the merits and further com\u00ad mented that \"it should be clear to the court below that nothing this Court does today precludes it from reaching the result it did under applicable state law.\"31 On remand following Justice Marshall's suggestion, the Texas court considered whether state law could sustain the original opin\u00ad ion. The Texas court concluded that it would not look to the available state constitution.32 It took a procedural way out, saying that \"[a]t no time during the trial of this case did the appellant urge that Art. I, Sec. 9, of the Texas Constitution supported his motion to suppress,\" and \"[i]t is funda\u00ad mental that the grounds for reversal urged on appeal must comport with the objections made at trial.\"33 Accordingly, the Court of Criminal Ap\u00ad peals affirmed White's conviction. Consider Justice Marshall's message. If Texas wants to decide rules of evidence for Texas courts it can do so. If Justice Marshall were a lone dissenting voice crying out in the wilderness telling lawyers and state judges to turn to state law, to state constitutions, to determine how state courts should process state criminal cases, we might not pay him too much heed. But Justice Marshall is not alone. We know Justice Brennan agrees with him. And a majority, if not all, of the other Justices of the United States Supreme Court recognize that a state may, as a matter of its own law, impose greater restrictions on state action than the United States Supreme Court does under federal constitutional standards.

Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, then judge of the Ari\u00ad zona Court of Appeals, acknowledged in the 1981 William and Mary Law Review that state courts are using their own state constitutions as a means of denning rights of criminal defendants and urged less federal court inter\u00ad vention in state court proceedings.38 The Burger Court has urged state courts to step forward and apply their own constitutional doctrine. The Burger Court has taken a states' rights stance. And the states' rights issue is as controversial in legal circles today as it was in the nineteenth century. Many resist the Burger Court's sugges\u00ad tion to base state court decisions on the state constitution. The critics of new federalism are strange bedfellows. The critics are the nationalists, those who think power should rest with the central govern\u00ad ment. The critics are states' rightists who view the new federalism as a plot to enlarge protection of individual rights. The critics are the civil libertari\u00ad ans who see new federalism as a technique for the federal government to get out of the business of ensuring civil liberties and civil rights and who think it will be harder to persuade fifty state courts instead of one United States Supreme Court of the correctness of their position. The critics also include those who fear that the state judges cannot handle the task and that the job of protecting individual rights will not be done by either the federal or state courts if new federalism prevails. There is, as you may know, a bias in the legal system against state judges. There is a myth that state judges play in the minor leagues of the American judicial system. The myth is that the best that can be said of many state judges is that they are buddies of the Governor whom the judge helped get elected. In contrast, so the myth goes, federal judges are competent students of the law and are sensitive to individual rights, even if they are buddies of the Senator or President whom the judge helped get elected. I do not take this criticism of state judges personally. I obviously believe individual judges should be judged on their individual merit, not on profiles or stereotypes.39 The fact is that the vast bulk of criminal litigation in this country is handled by state courts. The everyday burglar, robber, rapist, or murderer has violated state law and is tried in state court. Indeed, the bulk of all litigation in this country, civil or criminal, is handled by state courts. In Wisconsin, the federal judicial system is composed of six federal district judges, nine circuit judges of the Seventh Circuit, and the nine Supreme Court Justices. The Wisconsin court system has approximately 200 judges. The state judges are the workhorses. The state courts carry the heavy bur\u00ad den of dispensing justice. It is the state courts that interpret the rules peo\u00ad ple live by. It is the state judges, not the federal judges, who day in and 37. City of Mesquite v.

It is the state judges rather than the federal judges who are proba\u00ad bly best qualified to establish -the guidelines for search and seizure of automobiles under the state constitution, subject, of course, to the federal safety net. And finally among the critics of new federalism are many state judges. They fear that the state courts cannot take the heat that comes from decid\u00ad ing the tough individual rights cases. They worry that moving the arena of individual rights from Washington to the state capitals puts the constitu\u00ad tional issues closer to the public, who will become hostile to state court judges. A state judge in California says, \"I am frightened about the reac\u00ad tions of the lay person.\"40 He is concerned that the public accepts the United States Supreme Court as setting ultimate rules and will not accept the state court's exercising this power. He implies that state judges should be content to pass the buck to the United States Supreme Court on the difficult issues. Popularly elected state judges, he says, may have trouble resisting the popular and political pressures that may be adverse to indi\u00ad vidual rights. Federal judges with lifetime tenure are. immunized from popular pressure and sentiment. There is concern that if the people are unhappy about a state court decision, they will amend the state constitu\u00ad tion, which in many states may be relatively easy to do. If my memory is right, the death penalty was put into the California Constitution by the ballot in response to a decision of the California Supreme Court. Regardless of the critics, and they make good points and raise difficult issues, the issue presented by Justice Marshall in Texas v. White and by the Burger Court is this: Do good lawyering and good judging in the 1980s require an analysis of the state constitution in addition to or in lieu of an malysis of the federal Constitution? My answer is an unequivocal \"yes.\" Hut to aid you in evaluating my answer, I report, in keeping with the Wis\u00ad consin rules of open government and full disclosure, that a student note in i recent Marquette Law Review had the following comment about me and icw federalism: The most vociferous advocate of the new federalism on the Wisconsin court is Justice Abrahamson. In the most recent term of the court [1978], Justice Abrahamson has twice written concurring opinions in which she suggests that the Wisconsin constitutional provision against unreasonable searches and seizures should serve as the basis for deter\u00ad mining the validity of warrantless searches.41 I should again make clear just what it is that the Marquette Law Review liinks I am advocating. I am suggesting a process, a process for lawyers to ise in presenting cases involving individual rights and a process for state ourts to use in deciding such cases. I join those who propose that the state 40. Welsh & Collins, Taking Slate Constitutions Seriously, CENTER MAC, Sept.-Oct. 181. at 6, 33. 41. Comment.

REV. 596, 604 n.49 (1979). 305 1982] STATE COURTS 963 supreme courts should first examine state law, almost as a matter of rou\u00ad tine, in cases in which individual rights are involved. If the court con\u00ad cludes that state law, whether statute, the exercise of the court's supervisory power, or the state constitution, protects the rights, the court should say so.42 The case should be decided on the independent .state grounds. If analysis of federal law would reach the same result, the hold\u00ad ing can be further basecVbn federal constitutional law. The court must make clear, however, that the federal rationale does not dictate the result of the case. Only by carefully and responsibly explicating the different bases for the state and federal rationales can the state court justify a deci\u00ad sion as being on independent and adequate state grounds. I want to make clear that I am not, I am not, advocating a result. I am advocating a process. Although both proponents and critics of new feder\u00ad alism see the doctrine as a technique to expand protection for individual rights and to avoid following decisions of the United States Supreme Court, new federalism does not necessarily work this way. The state court might decide that the state law provides the same protection as the federal Constitution, using the same rationale as the United States Supreme Court, or using different reasons, or that state law provides more protec\u00ad tion than the federal Constitution. I suppose that the state courts might construe their constitution as providing a lesser degree of protection than the federal Constitution and that the state must apply the more rigorous command of the federal Constitution. My discussion should imply no preference for the decision to be made under the state constitutions. I sug\u00ad gest a process, not a result. Many trace new federalism to the reaction against the Burger Court and charge that new federalism is just a euphemism for a result-oriented doc\u00ad trine. But I remind you that looking to the state's law, usually the state's constitution, for protection of individual rights predates the Burger Court. State protection of individual rights is as old as the nation. In 1968, while the Warren Court was intact, Professor Countryman urged the importance of a state bill of rights when talking to a constitu\u00ad tional convention redrafting a state constitution. He reasoned that not all the federal rights are applied to states through the fourteenth amendment; modern society needs additional guarantees not found in the United States Constitution, and the fourteenth amendment governs only state action, not private action. The fourteenth amendment governs state infringement on free speech or unreasonable search and seizure. State constitutions can govern private action; thus California's free speech constitution, unlike the first amendment, can be interpreted to protect high school students distrib\u00ad uting hand bills at private shopping centers.43 42. The state court, in lieu of, or in addition to, relying on the state constitution, may rely on a state statute, or use its supervisory authority over the administration of justice to Tormulate a state rule. Decisions based on the state statutes or on the court's supervisory power avoid the rigidities of a decision based on the state constitution. 43. Prune Yard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74, 88 (1980). 306 964 SOUTHWESTERN LAW JOURNAL [Vol.36 In Texas v. White and other cases the United States Supreme Court is saying: State courts, look at your own state constitution. Whatever your view of the merits of new judicial federalism, I conclude that as lawyers and judges we must be alert to the concept, and we must deal with it. Professor Dawson writes in a recent Texas Law Review** that Texas v. White is not likely to be soon forgotten by the Texas bench or bar. His reading of the Texas cases decided after Texas v. White demonstrates that when the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals decides a fourth amendment issue in favor of the defendant, the court routinely attaches a citation to the Texas Constitution. He assumes that the lawyers cite the Texas Constitu\u00ad tion. Professor Dawson does not detect any movement by the Texas courts to determine independently of United States Supreme Court determina\u00ad tions as to what Texas constitutional provisions mean for the criminal process in Texas. The Texas Constitution is cited, but not analyzed.45 The Wisconsin Supreme Court similarly all too often treats it's constitution in the same manner as the Texas courts. Why don't the state courts turn to their own state constitution? It's a puzzle. The state courts do analyze and rely on their own constitution if there is no federal constitutional counterpart. They tend not to analyze their constitutional provision if there is a federal counterpart. I see several explanations. First, there is an understandable human tendency on the part of state judges to view a United States Supreme Court decision on a particular topic as the absolute, final truth. The Supreme Court said it; it must be right. Second, habit explains a great deal. In the 1960s and 1970s the lawyers and the courts got out of the habit of examining the state con\u00ad stitutional claim. They examined the federal claim and no more. Third, simplicity and ease. The fourteenth amendment establishes the minimum, the door below which the state cannot move. If the state action passes the minimum requirement, the lawyer and court are loathe to go on. It is easier for state judges and for lawyers to go along with the United States Supreme Court than to strike out on their own to analyze the state constitution. It is not an easy task to decide the nature of the rights protected by the state constitution. State constitutional law is rarely taught in law school.46 State constitutional law was not even taught at my law school in the 1950s, an era prior to the expansion of the fourteenth amendment. There are few contemporary works devoted to state constitutional law or to the subject of civil liberties under state constitutions.47 There are, as far as I know, no 44.

Professor Levinson of Vanderbilt University School of Law advises me that the law schools' interest in state constitutional law has increased in recent years.

Judicial education courses are beginning to include some mention of this topic, but much time in judicial education courses is spent on a review of recent United States Supreme Court decisions. In the past fifteen years or so numerous pieces have appeared in the law reviews on the concept of new federalism. And there are now appearing single state analyses of state constitutional law developments. There are excellent resource materials on the state constitutions, but they are not very well known to the bench or bar. There is an Index Digest of State Consti\u00ad tutions and a current compilation of state constitutions. In 1962 I worked on the prior editions of the most recent Index Digest and the compila\u00ad tion.48 I am not a Shirley-come-lately to the scene of state constitutional law. How am I as a state judge to decide what the state constitution means? I use the same techniques as I use to decide what any law means. I try to find the intent of the framers. First, I look at the language of the constitu\u00ad tion. Then I go to the legislative history\u2014the proceedings of the conven\u00ad tion, the state constitutions upon which our constitution is based. I examine the earlier decisions of our court, the decisions of sister courts, and the decisions of the United States Supreme Court construing the same or similar provisions. The reasoning of other courts may be persuasive. I look at the peculiarities of my state\u2014its land, its industry, its people, its history. Alas, it would be easier for me just to read the writings of the United States Supreme Court in the United Slates Law Week and follow the teachings.

One advantage of such analysis is diversity. We are at the same time a homogenous and an heterogenous culture, and we should have both a homogenous (national) and heteroge\u00ad nous (state) legal culture. We have uniform state laws like the commercial code. Yet, our states have different laws governing property, marriage, di\u00ad vorce, and torts. Your rights to recover in an auto accident depend sub\u00ad stantially upon which state's law applies. All the differences in our state constitutions are not accidents of draftsmanship. Some of these differences reflect differences in our tradition. Texas's Constitution has an equal rights amendment; Wisconsin's Constitution does not. When the federal Supreme Court decides a case limiting the powers of the states, the decision is one of national applicability and, hence, the Court is properly loath to establish a rule unless it can be implemented effectively nationwide. A state supreme court has more limited geographi\u00ad cal responsibility. Moreover, the Supreme Court of the United States is the court most remote from the problems of everyday concern for the ad\u00ad ministration of justice within a state and is less able to make a determina\u00ad tion of the practical appropriateness of a new rule. New federalism serves as a reminder to state courts that they should experiment with new ap\u00ad proaches that, if successful, may later be applied nationwide by the United States Supreme Court. State experimentation serves to guide the Supreme Court in its determinations. Some lawyers are bothered by this diversity, bothered that unreasonable search and seizure might mean one thing in Texas and another in Wiscon\u00ad sin. I am not disturbed; the minimal guarantee is the same in both states, the federal safety net. And uniformity in law, like some nationalized franchise restaurants, brings security of product, but offers no exciting surprises. In addition to diversity, a second advantage I see to the new federalism is stability. When state courts indiscriminately blanket United States Supreme Court decisions into the state's jurisprudence by basing their holdings on federal law, the law of the state changes each time the United States Supreme Court changes its decisions. Constitutional holdings of the United States Supreme Court can be vol\u00ad atile. They change more frequently than we generally assume. A recent article in the Wisconsin Law Review**1 points out that forty-seven constitu\u00ad tional holdings were reversed by the United States Supreme Court in the period from 1960 to 1979. Search and seizure of automobiles, the issue in Texas v. White, is an example of a field of federal constitutional law that is in a state of change. The rights of states' citizens in relation to their own state government can be protected from the vagaries and shifts of the United States Supreme Court. In this connection I note that the exclusionary rule, the rule -that evi- 49. Mallz. Some Thoughts on the Death of Stare Decisis in Constitutional Law, 1980 Wis. L. RHV. 467. 309 1982] STATE COURTS 967 dence seized illegally cannot be used at a state trial, was adopted by statute in Texas in 1925.50 The statute is still on the books. The exclusionary rule was imposed on the states as part of the fourteenth amendment in Mapp v. O/iio5' in 1961, thirty-six years after Texas adopted the exclusionary rule. The exclusionary rule, as articulated in Mapp v. Ohio, is in substantial danger of being overruled. Even if the United States Supreme Court over\u00ad turns the exclusionary rule, the rights of Texas and Wisconsin citizens would not be affected. The protections afforded by state statute in Texas and by the Wisconsin Constitution52 independently protect the right of the people to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures, regardless of the holdings of the United States Supreme Court. Hence, whatever may be the virtues and flaws of the exclusionary rule, it can be preserved in the states of Wisconsin and Texas by the people of these states regardless of the shifting sands of federal doctrine. Judge Rob\u00ad erts of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals made this very point in his dissent in Gillett v. State53 in which he laid the foundation for an in\u00ad dependent interpretation of the Texas Constitution. The Wisconsin and Texas exclusionary rules can be preserved, because the federal courts do not have jurisdiction over cases that arise under state law or state constitutions. Thus the states may interpret their own consti\u00ad tutions and their own laws as they see fit, provided always that the states do not lessen the rights guaranteed by the federal Constitution. When a state decision interpreting its own statutes or constitution is more protec\u00ad tive of a citizen's rights than the United States Supreme Court's interpreta\u00ad tion of the federal Constitution, the federal court will not review the state court decision if it rests on \"adequate and independent state grounds.\" The reason for the federal court's not reviewing state decisions resting on adequate and independent state grounds is founded on the Constitution itself. In 1945 Justice Jackson in Herb v. Pitcairn54 explained: This court from the time of its foundation has adhered to the princi\u00ad ple that it will not review judgements of state courts that rest on ade\u00ad quate and independent state grounds. . . . The reason is so obvious that it has rarely been thought to warrant statement. It is found in the partitioning of power between the state and federal judicial systems and in the limitations of our own jurisdiction. Our only power over state judgments is to correct them to the extent that they incorrectly adjudge federal rights. And our power is to correct wrong judgments, not to revise opinions. We are not permitted to render an advisory opinion, and if the same judgment would be rendered by the state court after we corrected its views of federal laws, our review could amount to nothing more than an advisory opinion.55 50.

What are adequate and in\u00ad dependent state grounds could be the subject of discussion for a substantial part of a course on federal jurisdiction.56 Suffice it to say that new federal\u00ad ism can result in less federal judicial review of state court decisions. Thus some oppose the new federalism, saying the state courts are thwarting and evading judicial review. Sounds wicked, unlawful. But it is not. It is entirely appropriate in our federal system for state courts to base their decisions on state law, free of federal intervention. And the United States Supreme Court is in a way encouraging the courts to cut ofTits review. My case in point is one very close to University Park. On February 23, 1982, the United States Supreme Court decided City of Mesquite v. Aladdin's Castle, Inc.51 This case was originally tried by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas at Dallas.58 It went to the Fifth Circuit59 and then to the United States Supreme Court. This case involves Pac-Man and Space Invaders. The City of Mesquite adopted an ordinance prohibiting children under the age of seventeen from playing coin-operated games unless accompanied by a parent or guardian. Aladdin's Castle sued in federal court for declaratory and injunctive relief on the ground that the age restriction impermissibly trammels the children's constitutional interest in associational freedoms. To put it into non-legalese, the children are saying they want to be with their friends. The jurisdiction of the federal district court was based on diversity and federal questions. The federal court of appeals held the ordinance uncon\u00ad stitutional, apparently resting its decision on-its interpretation of the Texas Constitution as well as the federal Constitution.-The Fifth Circuit said: 56. See Oregon v. Kennedy, 50 U.S.L.W. 4544, 4545, 4547 n:i (U.S. May 24, 1982) concurring); Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 652-54 (1979). In his remarks to the American Judicature Society on Aug. 6, 1982, Justice Stevens was critical or the Court's unwillingness to allow state courts to make the final decision in cases in which the state court remains free to reinstate its prior judgment by unambiguously rely\u00ad ing on state rather than federal law. Justice Stevens said: The decision to review (and to reverse summarily without argument) a novel holding by a California intermediate appellate court concerning the burden of proof in an obscenity trial, or an equally novel holding by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court concerning a police officer's order commanding the driver of a vehicle to get out of his car after a traffic violation, are additional examples of the many cases in which the Court has been unwilling to allow a state court to provide one of its residents more protection than the Federal Constitution re\u00ad quires even though the state decision affected only a limited territory and did not create a conflict with any other decision on a question of federal law, and even though the state court had the power to reinstate its original judgment by relying on state law. A willingness to allow the decision of other courts to stand until it is necessary to review them is not a characteristic of this Court when it believes that error may have been committed.

In other words, the United States Supreme Court couldn't tell whether the Texas Constitution provided an adequate and independent ground for the court of appeals'judgment. The United States Supreme Court held that it would not decide the novel federal constitutional question presented by Mesquite if Texas law provided independent support for the court of ap\u00ad peals'judgment.61 So the United States Supreme Court remanded the case to the court of appeals to decide whether its opinion rested on Texas or federal law.62 Justice Stevens, writing for the majority, said some interesting things about state constitutional law. He said: It is first noteworthy that the language of the Texas constitutional provision is different from, and arguably significantly broader than, the language of the corresponding federal provisions. As a number of recent state supreme court decisions demonstrate, a state court is en\u00ad tirely free to read its own constitution more broadly than this Court ' reads the Federal Constitution, or to reject the mode of analysis used by this Court in favor of a different analysis of its corresponding con\u00ad stitutional guarantee. See generally Brennan, State Constitutions and the Protection of Individual Rights, 90 Harv. L. Rev. 489 (1977), and cases cited therein. Because learned members of the Texas bar sit on the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and because that court confronts questions of Texas law in the regular course of its judicial business, that court is in a better position than are we to recognize any special nuances of state law. The fact that the Court of Appeals cited only four Texas cases is an insufficient basis for concluding that it did not make an independent analysis of Texas law.63 Justice White and Justice Powell dissented from the remand. Their opinions question why the United States Supreme Court did not reach the merits of the issue.64 The Mesquite case tells us that federal courts can base their decisions on state constitutions, and the United States Supreme Court will not review interpretations of state constitutional law, whether the interpretation is made by the federal or state courts. Thus, federal courts can protect their 60. Id. al 1038-39 (footnotes omitted). 61. 50 U.S.L.W. 4210, 4212 (U.S. Feb. 23, 1982). 62. Id. at 4213. 63. Id at 4212. 64.

As you can see, it is entirely appropriate for state courts to evade Supreme Court review by basing a decision on state law. On the other hand, it is not appropriate for state courts to object to the United States Supreme Court's establishing minimal national rights, the federal safety net. For new federalism to work, the United States Supreme Court and the state courts must maintain a healthy respect for the role each plays. State court judges are not asking the United States Supreme Court to cease interpreting the fourteenth amendment. Let me give you an example of the state court judges being protective of the jurisdiction of the federal courts. As you know from the newspapers there are some twenty bills in Congress seeking to take away substantive jurisdiction of the federal courts in certain areas, including prayer in public schools, abortion, school bus\u00ad ing, and sex discrimination in the armed services. These bills would also prohibit review by the United States Supreme Court of state court deci\u00ad sions in some of these areas. A subcommittee of the State-Federal Relations Committee of the Con\u00ad ference of Chief Justices of the States studied these bills, not in terms of their constitutionality, but in terms of their policy. The subcommittee noted that these bills would have two results. First, the bills would make the existing Supreme Court interpretations in these taboo areas the law of the land forever. The bills would cast the existing federal constitutional law in concrete. Second, fifty state supreme courts would apply the federal Constitution in new fact situations without any single continuing unifying interpretation by the United States Supreme Court. A single interpreta\u00ad tion of the Constitution is one thing, but fifty interpretations of one federal Constitution is another.66 The state chief justices are not happy about the bills. They suspect that Congress was going to give the state courts power, because Congress 65. The Mesquile majority commented on avoidance of Supreme Court appellate re\u00ad view by the federal courts as follows: Our dissenting brethren suggest that our \"view allows federal courts overrul\u00ad ing state statutes to avoid appellate review here simply by adding citations to state cases when applying federal law,\"post, at 3 (Powell, J., dissenting). We are unwilling to assume that any federal judge would discharge his judicial responsibilities in that fashion. In any event, in this case we merely hold that the Court of Appeals must explain the basis for its conclusion, if there be one, that the state ground is adequate and independent of the federal ground.

The chief justices were somewhat offended, indeed miffed, in being so viewed by Congress. The state chief justices went on record questioning the wisdom of these bills.67 The chief justices view the bills as a hazardous experiment on the vulnerable fabric of the nation's judicial system. The terms federalism and states' rights are value laden. They conjure up images of secession from the national government, separatist move\u00ad ments, and retention of the status quo in face of change. Ironically, the modern version of new federalism calls upon the states, state courts, not merely to negate the federal influence, but to develop a body of state law for the protection of their citizens. The new federalism proposed by the Burger Court makes life difficult for state judges, because it challenges them to make federalism work. To quote Chief Justice Burger: \"The 50 states cannot exercise leadership in a national sense, but this does not mean they should not be allowed the inde\u00ad pendence and freedom that was plainly contemplated by the concept of federalism.\"68 I concur. I recognize that the practice of making every case a federal claim will die hard. I recognize that the practice of looking to the United States Supreme Court for all law will die hard. I recognize that it will take a long time before courts, as a matter of routine, look to their own state law, espe\u00ad cially their own constitutions. Nevertheless, I think we must begin to change our ways. State constitutions are coming out of the archives into the legal literature and into the classroom. They are coming out of the literature and the classroom into the courtroom. State constitutions will go from the court\u00ad room back into the legal literature and into the classroom, and may\u00ad be back to the courtroom, through the lawyers trained in the 1980s. And finally, state constitutions are beginning to come into popular conscious\u00ad ness through the media.69 I think this is a good trend. Today I carry with me from Wisconsin to Texas the admonition of Jus\u00ad tice Smith of the Wisconsin Supreme Court in the 1855 case of The Attor\u00ad ney General ex rel. Bashford v. Barstow.10 The justice's words in 1855 may serve state supreme courts well in 1982. Speaking of Wisconsin, he said: \"The people then made this constitution, and adopted it as their primary law.

INTRODUCTION Under the federal supremacy clause,1 not only must state courts apply federal law where appropriate, but they are subject to review by the federal courts when federal law is applied im\u00ad properly. Although state judges may disagree with particular de\u00ad cisions of the federal courts, state judges should have no quarrel with federal review of state court decisions involving federal questions. If there is to be any semblance of uniformity in the application of federal constitutional provisions by the state courts, it is inevitable, if not desirable, that federal courts, and particularly the United States Supreme Court, have the last word. Unfortunately, because of the manner in which federal re\u00ad view of state court decisions is exercised, state cases involving federal constitutional questions are no longer final, and excessive delay is commonplace, particularly in criminal cases. The result\u00ad ing confusion and delay in the application of federal law by the state courts have detracted from the prestige of the state courts and eroded the force and effect of state court decisions. Assum\u00ad ing that the achievement of consistency, predictability, and rea\u00ad sonably prompt finality in state court decisions can be compati- * Justice, Arizona Supreme Court.

II. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS When we became a nation, routine review by the federal courts of state court decisions was not contemplated, and there is some question whether the framers of the Constitution envi\u00ad sioned the establishment of federal trial courts at all, leaving to the state trial courts the responsibility of deciding federal ques\u00ad tions in a trial setting. The Judiciary Act of 1789,2 however, cre\u00ad ated thirteen federal district courts, divided into three circuits.' The resulting system was simple enough: state cases were tried in state courts, and federal cases, what few there were, were tried in federal courts. Our population was agrarian and small, commerce among the new states was limited, and the right to travel was a little-used privilege under our federal Constitution. That the law in one state was different from the law of a sister state was of little concern to the citizens or the courts. Professor Daniel Meador has commented: In the first decade of its existence, the Supreme Court re\u00ad viewed only seven state court decisions, and for the next sev\u00ad eral decades it reviewed about an average of one state judg\u00ad ment a year. The state judges, by virtue of the Federal Supremacy Clause, were compelled to apply federal law when\u00ad ever it came into play, but federal law was so skimpy in the early decades that this posed little or no added burden on the state judges.' This pattern began to change during the Reconstruction pe\u00ad riod that followed the War Between the States. In 1867 Congress gave federal courts jurisdiction over petitions for writs of habeas corpus filed by state prisoners,6 and in 1868 ratification of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution imposed due process and equal protection upon the states as a matter of federal law. 2.

This gave the federal courts substantial power and jurisdiction, requiring them to su\u00ad pervise the constitutionality of state officials' activities. Thus, federal district court judges have the power to hear evidence, make factual determinations, and issue injunctions. As a practi\u00ad cal matter, these powers are in some respects greater than those enjoyed by the United States Supreme Court. The result has been the expansion of the business of the federal courts. This interest of federal courts in state matters\u2014the result of a cooperative venture among the United States Congress, the executive branch of the federal government, and the federal ju\u00ad diciary\u2014came about during a period in which federal power was increasing and becoming more centralized. This expansion of federal jurisdiction reflected a concern for minimum, if not uni\u00ad form, standards of justice for all citizens throughout the country, a concern that has continued to this day. As Justice Brennan has stated: In recent years, however, another variety of federal law\u2014that fundamental law protecting all of us from the use of governmental powers in ways inconsistent with American con\u00ad ceptions of human liberty\u2014has dramatically altered the grist of the state courts. Over the past two decades, decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States have returned to the fun\u00ad damental promises wrought by the blood of those who fought our War between the States, promises which were thereafter embodied in our fourteenth amendment\u2014that the citizens of all our states are also and no less citizens of our United States, that this birthright guarantees our federal constitutional liber\u00ad ties against encroachment by governmental action at any level of our federal system, and that each of us is entitled to due process of law and the equal protection of the laws from our state governments no less than from our national one. . . . [S]tate courts no less than federal are and ought to be the guardians of our liberties.7 The Task Force of the Conference of Chief Justices and the Conference of State Court Administrators, in its report on a State Justice Institute, noted that there is just as much national 6. 209 U.S. 123 (1908). 7.

PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS: A SURVEY Stating that problems can be remedied only in the federal courts is but another way of saying that state judges are unable to adequately address federal questions in the state courts. Pro\u00ad fessor Meador has noted that one of the \"speculated\" theories for the habeas corpus decisions was the Supreme Court's lack of confidence in state judges.10 Indeed, in the debate on the Civil Rights Act of 1871, Congressman Coburn stated: \"The United States courts are further above mere local influence than the county courts; their judges can act with more independence, cannot be put under terror, as local judges can; their sympathies are not so nearly identified with those of the vicinage . . . . \"u And Professor Neuborne has claimed that \"parity\" between the state and federal courts in the enforcement of federal rights is a \"dangerous myth.\"12 Judge Aldisert has suggested that the low public image of the state courts is a result of academia and the media rather than an actual difference in the quality of the two court systems: There are significant reasons for the present infatuation with federal courts as the preferred forum for litigation. First, there is the influence of academia, exercised by the law profes\u00ad sors and their captive audiences, the law students. A basic no\u00ad tion of modern legal academia is that the federal judiciary is a unique institution: That somehow the law is different there, or the proceedings more conducive to reasoned disposition; that 8.

Preference for federal courts is also reinforced by the poor public image of state courts. Although there is some profes\u00ad sional literature, very few public accounts today praise the state judiciary. The media continually emphasizes the state ju\u00ad diciary's shortcomings; and the resulting public impression is that state courts do not amount to much, and the most con\u00ad structive, judge-made, substantive law emanates from the United States Supreme Court or from the lower federal courts. Unfortunately, federal judges have not only fallen into the trap of believing their press notices, but are starting to say it themselves.18 Of course, not everyone believes state judges are inferior. Judge Donald P. Lay, of the Eighth Circuit, has noted, \"It would be presumptuous to claim that federal judges are more compe\u00ad tent, conscientious, or learned than their state brethren in the area of federal rights.\"14 And Professor A. E. Dick Howard, while admitting that the preference for federal courts is fre\u00ad quently based upon a distrust of state courts, notes that there is still support for the state courts: \"To this day, the argument goes on between those who look to the federal courts as the pri\u00ad mary vindicator of federal rights and those who, noting that state judges also are sworn to uphold the Constitution, would repose more trust in the state tribunals.\"\" The idea that the state judiciaries are inferior has played a greater role in congressional legislation and federal court deci\u00ad sions than is willingly admitted. At this point we might ask if the assumed inferiority of the state judiciaries has any substance in fact. Of course, when we compare the smaller (fewer than 800 judges), better paid, and carefully selected federal judiciary with 13.

But when comparing the state trial judges of courts of general jurisdiction with their counterparts on the federal dis\u00ad trict court bench, there is no reason to believe that the quality of state judges does not equal the quality of the federal judges, dif\u00ad ferences in tenure and compensation notwithstanding. The persons who should be in the best position to evaluate the performance of state judges, as compared to the performance of federal judges, are the lawyers who practice before the trial courts. These lawyers, who submit their clients' cases for deci\u00ad sion and who must rely upon the courts for their professional standing, as well as their professional income, should be in a po\u00ad sition to compare the two court systems. In order to ascertain their attitudes, a survey was made of ten jurisdictions in the United States: San Diego County (San Diego), California Gadsen County (Tallahassee), Florida Palm Beach County (Palm Beach), Florida Cook County (Chicago), Illinois Sangamon County (Springfield), Illinois Essex County (Newark), New Jersey Monmouth County (Freehold), New Jersey Bernalillo County (Albuquerque), New Mexico Spokane County (Spokane), Washington Milwaukee County (Milwaukee), Wisconsin. The jurisdictions were selected on the basis of geographical loca\u00ad tion and on the basis of differences in judicial selection processes. New Mexico, for example, is a state in which the judges stand for election in a political campaign.\" New Jersey was selected because it is not considered to have a \"political ju\u00ad diciary\"; it has a selection process more akin to the federal sys\u00ad tem.\" Also, there was an attempt to compare urban and rural counties in two states: New Jersey and Illinois. The clerks of the superior, district, or circuit courts in the selected state jurisdictions were asked to distribute a total of fifty questionnaires, one to each lawyer who had just filed a civil 16.

CONST, art. 6, \u00a7 6, H 1. 322 545] NATIONAL COURT OF APPEALS 551 action in the state court.18 The attorneys were asked to state the nature of the case, for example, tort, contract, divorce, etc. They were then asked, \"If there were no time or jurisdiction problems and you had a choice, would you have preferred to file this case in a federal court or in the state court?\"\" They were also asked to make such comments as they felt necessary. The actions were about equally divided among divorce (79), tort (71), and contract (74), with \"other\" accounting for 32 re\u00ad sponses. Of those responding, the preference was: Federal court 34 State court 193 No preference 18 When asked the reasons for their preferences, 11 of the 34 favor\u00ad ing the federal court and 48 of the 193 favoring state courts cited quicker disposition as the reason. Superior procedure and the quality of the judges were the second and third reasons for preferring the federal courts, while familiarity and convenience were the second and third reasons for preferring the state courts. When asked if the interest of their clients would be better served in the federal court or state court, the results were: Federal court 30 State court 124 No difference 94 But when asked if the quality of the judges was better in the federal court or the state court, the results were: Federal court 95 State court 30 No difference 125 Of interest is the fact that, out of the 95 who said the federal judges were of better quality, 58 still preferred to file in the state courts, and 28 thought the interests of their clients were better served in the state courts. The results of the survey are given in the Appendix to this Article. 18. The matters were limited to civil cases because defense attorneys in criminal cases do not have a choice as to which court to appear in, and I assume they would be unhappy wherever they are forced to be at a particular time. 19. The one page questionnaire was contained in a stamped envelope addressed to me at my home address. There was no indication on the envelope or on the questionnaire that I was a state judge. The questionnaire did not have to be signed by the attorney, and although the county was indicated, the identity of the attorney was not known if he did not indicate it on the questionnaire. 323 552 BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [1981 A comparison of the results in four of the jurisdictions may be of interest. They include Essex (urban) and Monmouth (ru\u00ad ral) counties in New Jersey, a state in which judges are selected in a manner similar to that of the federal system; Bernalillo County, New Mexico, which has a political system of election; and Cook County, Illinois, where politics in the selection of judges is reputed to be intrusive: Cook County, Bernalillo Monmouth County, Essex County, Illinois County, N,M.

In fact, probably the most notable result of the survey in general is the lack of startling or conclusive differences that can be ascertained between state and federal judges or state and fed\u00ad eral courts. Answers to one of the questions, for example, indi\u00ad cate that more lawyers (95 to 30) thought that the quality of federal judges was better than the quality of state judges, but one-half of those who answered the question (125) thought there was no difference. The preference for state courts as a forum for their clients may be the result of the nature of the case and more familiarity on the part of the lawyer with the procedures 324 545] NATIONAL COURT OF APPEALS 553 followed and the personnel of the court. The differences between the two systems, rather than differences between the quality of the judges, may well be the more important factor. In any event, the answers to the questionnaire do not indicate that either fed\u00ad eral or state judges are clearly superior in the perception of the lawyers. On the contrary, if the answers indicate anything at all, it is that there is not a great deal of difference between the qual\u00ad ity of judges or justice in the two court systems. IV. UNWARRANTED FEDERAL SUPERVISION OF STATE COURT DECISIONS There being no great difference in the quality of judges or justice in the state and federal judiciaries, it may be questioned whether it is necessary for federal judges to review state r< t decisions to ensure that federal law will be enforced in the state courts. After all, state judges take an oath to uphold the Consti\u00ad tution of the United States as do federal judges, and state judges are just as capable of interpreting the Constitution and the deci\u00ad sions of the United States Supreme Court as are their brethren on the federal bench. Federal review, therefore, is not needed to ensure the quality of state court decisions; federal review is needed only to ensure consistency and uniformity in the applica\u00ad tion of federal constitutional standards in the state courts. The problem then is not that federal review of state court decisions involving federal questions is unnecesary; some form of federal review will always be necessary. The problem is that in discharg\u00ad ing this review function the federal courts are guilty of delay and inconsistency and often review beyond the degree needed to en\u00ad sure minimum federal standards of justice in the state courts, all to the detriment of state judicial systems. Hart & Wechsler cites the Hawk case as an example of en\u00ad tangled and protracted procedures between the state and federal courts.20 Henry Hawk was sentenced in 1936 by a Nebraska trial court to life imprisonment for murder. Sixteen years later, after numerous actions in both state and federal courts, including six trips to the United States Supreme Court, Hawk was finally or\u00ad dered discharged by a federal district court.21 20.

(1) he may seek review by the state's appellate court (if there is an intermediate appellate court, there may be a two-stage appellate process), and (2) he may follow postconviction procedures in the state court that provide a basis for entry into the federal courts. Next, (3) the defendant can petition for a writ of certiorari or a direct appeal to the United States Supreme Court. If access to the United States Supreme Court is denied, as is most often the case, (4) the defendant then, by filing a petition for writ of habeas corpus, may go to the federal district court. If denied relief there, (5) he may appeal to the United States circuit court of appeals, and if he loses there, (6) he may go back again to the United States Supreme Court, this time from the decision of the court of appeals. The recent case of Greene v. Massey\" is an example of these processes. In 1965, Greene and a codefendant, Sosa, were indicted for murder and were convicted. The conviction was set aside by the Florida Supreme Court,\" and a new trial ordered. The new trial was held, and Green was again convicted. This conviction was upheld by the Florida Court of Appeals against the defendant's double jeopardy claim.24 Greene then sought re\u00ad lief in the United States Supreme Court, which denied his peti\u00ad tion for a writ of certiorari.28 Greene next petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal district court, which was denied. From the federal district court, Greene went to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which affirmed the federal district court.29 Again Greene petitioned to the United States Supreme Court, but this time certiorari was granted, and on June 14, 1978, the United States Suppeme Court reversed the decision of the Fifth Circuit.27 But even this did not conclude parte Hawk, 318 U.S. 746 (1943); Ex parte Hawk, 321 U.S. 114 (1944); Hawk v.

The United States Supreme Court did not finally dispose of this case, but instead remanded it to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for a reinterpretation of the Florida Supreme Court decision of 1968 (some 10 years ear\u00ad lier) in light of later opinions of the United States Supreme Court. The United States Supreme Court stated: \"The Court of Appeals will be free to direct further proceedings in the District Court or to certify unresolved questions of state law to the Flor\u00ad ida Supreme Court.\"28 The delay and confusion caused by this method of federal review of state court decisions has resulted in what must be the most costly and inefficient system ever devised by man. Admit\u00ad tedly, we have grown callous to this delay, but I would suggest that it cannot be justified when viewed in the light of any rea\u00ad sonable concept of efficient administration. Some reform is nec\u00ad essary if the state courts, which decide 98.8% of the cases in this country,29 are to be able to apply federal law evenly and fairly, as the United States Constitution requires. The public and the parties are entitled to a reasonable, prompt determination of federal questions by a court that speaks uniformly and finally. As it is, there is neither promptness, finality, nor uniformity in federal review of state decisions. State judges can take little satisfaction from the fact that only a relatively few state cases are actually overturned by the federal courts. The state judiciaries, like their federal counter\u00ad parts, must depend upon public acceptance of their decisions to be effective. The damage done to the prestige of state courts and to the acceptability of their decisions is great. It is somewhat ironic that federal courts, in their stated desire to assure due process and equal protection to all citizens, are, by their efforts, robbing those citizens of some of the essential ingredients of due process and equal protection, to wit, speedy, final and predict- 28. Id. at 27. 29. A memorandum from Nora Blair of the National Center for State Courts to Francis J. Taillefer, Project Director, and National Courts Statistics Project (dated April 16, 1979 on file at National Center for State Courts) indicates that 98.8rf of current cases are handled in state courts. See also Sheran and Isaac- man, State Cases Belong in State Courts, 12 CREIGHTON L. REV. 1 (1978). Task Force Report, supra note 8, at 5 n.5. Our system is still structured on the basic premise that the state courts are the primary forums for deciding the controversies which arise in the great mass of day-to-day dealings among citizens. Meador Speech, supra note 4, at 10. 327 556 BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [1981 able justice, uniformly and consistently applied. Chief Justice Burger stated, \"The criminal process should not extend over a span of three, five or seven years, with repeated appeals and re\u00ad peated collateral attacks on convictions. At some point, there must be finality. Without finality, justice is a myth.\"30 If the delay is intolerable, so is the inconsistent application of federal law to the states by the federal courts. The state judi\u00ad cial system is generally consistent in its application of both state and federal law. The state's highest court is the last word on what the law is for that state, and it will be alert to the need for a unified and consistent body of state law. The result is a pre\u00ad dictable, uniform, and final system of law within the state. Such is not the case within the federal system. The law from circuit to circuit can be different, and basic United States constitutional questions can depend upon the fed\u00ad eral circuit in which the state happens to be located. The law within the circuit can also depend upon which panel of the cir\u00ad cuit hears the case. The confusion is even worse on the federal district level. In each state there may be just as many interpre\u00ad tations as there are federal district judges. Also, there can be different results where the petitions to the federal courts contain variant recitations of the facts of the case and the law to be ap\u00ad plied. This is not a criticism of the federal trial judiciary; most federal district judges attempt to harmonize the law of their dis\u00ad trict. However, except for the United States court of appeals, there is no unifying court over the district to enforce consistency in the same manner that a state supreme court does for the state courts. What has happened in the federal judiciary is that the sheer number of cases makes it impossible for the United States Su\u00ad preme Court to supervise effectively the state and federal judi\u00ad cial systems. Professors Carrington, Meador and Rosenberg have stated: The problem of national uniformity derives from a weak\u00ad ness in the federal appellate hierarchy. The weakness i9 a re\u00ad sult of overgrowth: the hegemony of the Supreme Court of the United States is too attenuated to be effective as the unifying arch of the structure.

The Court is forced to scant many of the matters for which it bears the ultimate responsibility.\" V. THE NEED FOR REFORM As a possible solution to these problems, some observers suggest abolition of our dual system of justice. Professor Meador has compared recent trends with the consolidation of the courts in England: The accretion of federal jurisdiction, the growing dominance of the federal judiciary and the drawing together of the two sys\u00ad tems are reminiscent of developments in England centuries ago. After the Normans arrived and established the seeds of a central national government, there arose in England for the first time some central, national courts \u2014 Common Pleas, King's Bench, and the Exchequer. But at the beginning and for many, many years, these courts had very limited jurisdiction. The great bulk of everyday dispute settlement rested in the local courts of various sorts\u2014county seats, feudal courts, and others. Gradually, however, as the centuries passed, the juris\u00ad diction of the central courts increased. By various procedural inventions and fictions they drew unto themselves an ever in\u00ad creasing amount of judicial business which previously had been in the hands of the local courts. Ultimately, the local courts were eclipsed, and the central courts became all embracing in their authority.\" It is Professor Meador's belief that the courts in the United States are presently in a period of transition and that the emer\u00ad gence of a federal structure quite different from the original state-federal design is not only possible but logical, as a strong federal judiciary, aided by Congress, asserts more federal au\u00ad thority over the state judiciaries/8 Chief Justice Burger, while perceiving a dim outline of \"state court dockets and federal dockets becoming more and more alike,\"34 cautions that \"[t]hese observers may be in the position of a small boy looking down a stretch of straight railroad track when, by optical illusion, the rails seem to converge, but this presumption is not frivolous. 31.

As Professor Meador has pointed out, in Australia and Canada, state court decisions are reviewed by a federal tribunal that decides all legal questions, both state and federal. The Fed\u00ad eral Republic of Germany has no federal trial courts, the courts of first instance being provided by the states and reviewed in federal appellate courts.\" Adoption of this mode in the United States would require a radical restructuring of our historical state-federal relationship. It is highly unlikely that this model would ever be adopted in this country, even if desirable. Since a merger of the two court systems is unlikely, unless radical measures are taken, the present dual system is likely to continue, with the state courts deciding the overwhelming ma\u00ad jority of cases and the federal courts exercising some kind of re\u00ad view of state court decisions involving federal questions. How\u00ad ever, the present inefficient and time-consuming system must be modified. What is needed is a method that will rely more heavily on the proven abilities of state judges and the admitted capacity of the state judicial systems, while at the same time preserving the minimum amount of review necessary to ensure that federal questions are properly and uniformly addressed by the state ju\u00ad dicial systems. State courts must continue to follow and apply federal law where necessary, but this can be accomplished with\u00ad out excessive and disruptive interference by the federal courts. VI. THE PROPOSAL: A NATIONAL COURT OF STATE APPEALS It is therefore proposed that Congress create a National Court of State Appeals consisting of nine judges, appointed by the President pursuant to Article III of the United States Con\u00ad stitution, with original appellate jurisdiction to review state court decisions, both civil and criminal, in which federal ques\u00ad tions have been raised and state remedies exhausted. This court would consider not only direct appeals from the state's highest court, but would have exclusive original jurisdiction over all col\u00ad lateral attacks on state court decisions (presently filed in the federal district courts). This would completely divest the federal district courts of jurisdiction to review decisions of state courts on federal constitutional questions. It would be a discretionary 35. Id. at 4. 36. Meador Speech, supra note 4, at 22. 330 545] NATIONAL COURT OF APPEALS 559 court. It would also be a court of entry to the United States Su\u00ad preme Court from decisions of the state's highest court. The concept of a National Court of State Appeals is not new. In 1968 the American Bar Foundation first proposed a Na\u00ad tional Court of Appeals, but the concept provoked little inter\u00ad est.37 Judge Clement F. Haynsworth, Jr., proposed a court that would have \"jurisdiction to review on writs of certiorari federal questions in convictions in the state and federal systems in which a conviction is called into question.\"38 The Study Group on the Caseload of the United States Supreme Court (The Freund Committee) proposed a National Court of Appeals which would be a screening court for the United States Supreme Court and would be empowered to decide cases of conflicts among the circuit courts.39 In 1975 the Commission on Revision of the Federal Court Appellate System (The Hruska Commis\u00ad sion) proposed the establishment of a National Court of Appeals that would have reference jurisdiction from the United States Supreme Court and transfer jurisdiction from the Court of Claims or Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.40 Dean Erwin N. Griswold proposed a National Court of the United States which would be assigned cases by the United States Supreme Court after that court had granted the petition for certiorari.41 All of the proposals for a National Court of Appeals had one thing in common. They viewed the problem from the standpoint of the federal judiciary and were concerned with relieving the pressure on the United States Supreme Court. There is no doubt that relief is needed, but if the individual litigant is to be re\u00ad lieved of the time-consuming process of federal review and if the states are to be given the proper guidance by the federal courts, then the needs of the state courts should be seriously considered in any proposal for reform of federal judicial procedure.

The United States Supreme Court must remain supreme. 2. The position and prestige of the state courts must not be demeaned. 3. The federal judiciary should not be unduly expanded. 4. The new court must be able to attract competent and able judges. 5. The docket of the court must be manageable. 6. It must be constitutional. 7. Justice must be done. Others, in stating the conditions for the establishment of a National Court of Appeals, have stressed the avoidance of a fourth tier of federal courts and the avoidance of specializa\u00ad tion.42 These stated conditions are examined below in the hopes of overcoming some of the objections voiced by opponents of the concept of a National Court of State Appeals.43 42.

The proposal for a National Court of State Appeals was presented to the Con\u00ad ference of Chief Justices in Flagstaff, Arizona, in August of 1979, and the Conference deferred action. In Chicago, in February of 1980, action was again deferred. At that time, Chief Judge Lawrence H. Cooke, Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals, spoke in opposition based upon inadequate specification of the jurisdiction to be exercised and the inability of the court to handle the caseload. Chief Judge Cooke further opposed the resolution because: 3. Such a court would be an additional burden for the taxpayer. 4. With but one court in the entire country to handle these matters, great expense and inconveniences would be visited upon litigants and members of the bar, most of whom would be required to travel long distances to the seat of the court, wherever that might be. 5. It would be denigrating to the Supreme Courts of the states and convert their status from that of a final arbiter to that of an intermediate appellate court. 6. If the purpose of this new court is to end disparity between decisions of existing United States Courts of Appeals, the effort starts at the wrong end. Rather, there should be created for such a purpose a federal court to review the decisions of the federal Courts of Appeals. 7. Lastly and most importantly, the concept of such a court, as so briefly sketched in the resolution, is that, and I quote, \"[it] would have jurisdiction to review on a discretionary basis criminal and quasi-criminal cases, including ap\u00ad plications for writs of habeas corpus, presently reviewed by the Federl District Courts and the Circuit Courts of Appeal. . . . This jurisdiction would be in place of and not in addition to the jurisdiction presently exercised by the Fed\u00ad eral District Courts and the Circuit Courts of Appeals.\" Such a concept, with\u00ad out doubt, would be violative of the United States Constitution. Under Article 1, section 9, clause 1 thereof, the right of habeas corpus shall not be abridged 332 545] NATIONAL COURT OF APPEALS 561 A. The Supremacy of the United States Supreme Court Of prime importance is that the United States Supreme Court remain supreme. Final state court decisions involving fed\u00ad eral questions in criminal cases would bypass review by the fed\u00ad eral district courts and the United States circuit courts of ap\u00ad peals but would not avoid review by the United States Supreme Court, which would have the ultimate review of these decisions and would be the final word on federal law. Two steps and two opportunities for federal courts to review state court criminal decisions would be replaced by one possible review by the Na\u00ad tional Court of State Appeals. Review of state court criminal de\u00ad cisions by the United States Supreme Court would be expedited, as there would be only one level of review between the highest state court and the United States Supreme Court. Since civil cases would also be routed through the National Court of State Appeals, there would be uniformity of processing for both civil and criminal matters. For the United States Supreme Court to remain supreme, however, it is not necessary that the Court remain open for every matter that is thrust upon it. This is the very reason the United States Supreme Court is presently overloaded. This over\u00ad loading increases the danger that worthy litigants will be over\u00ad looked in the crush of frivolous and meritless petitions. Two procedures will allow the National Court of State Appeals to dis\u00ad pose of, with finality, the vast majority of cases presented to it while providing an avenue for review by the United States Su\u00ad preme Court of those cases that need the Court's attention. First, as suggested by Judge Haynsworth in his proposal for a National Court of Appeals and as followed in some states that have intermediate courts of appeal, certiorari or appeal from the National Court of State Appeals to the United States Supreme Court should be allowed only when one or more of the judges of the National Court of State Appeals dissent. Since the court will have nine judges, presumably of varying shades of philosophy by Congress. And that is exactly what such a court as proposed by the resolu\u00ad tion would do! No longer would the United States District Courts or the United States Courts of Appeals have jurisdiction over habeas corpus. This National Court of State Review would have such jurisdiction, but only on a \"discretionary\" basis \u2014 thus a clear and definite abridgement if there ever was one. Remarks by Lawrence H. Cooke, Conference of Chief Judges, Chicago, Illinois (Feb. 1980). 333 562 BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [1981 and background, it is unlikely that appeal of a worthy case will be foreclosed by a unanimous opinion of the National Court of State Appeals.44 Second, a procedure can be provided that would allow the parties or the Chief Justice of the National Court of State Ap\u00ad peals, after briefs have been filed and the matter is ready for submission, to petition the United States Supreme Court for transfer to that court. The parties would have to show extraordi\u00ad nary reasons why the matter should be transferred. For example, a case like Bakke,** in which it was apparent to all that it should be decided by the United States Supreme Court, could, upon request, bypass the National Court of State Appeals and go di\u00ad rectly to the United States Supreme Court. This method has been used effectively in Arizona to bypass the Court of Appeals.48 These two procedures will allow ample opportunity for re\u00ad view by the United States Supreme Court without placing too great a burden on the Court to hear petitions for review of each and every case decided by the National Court of State Appeals. The National Court of State Appeals would not be independent of the United States Supreme court, but subservient and always subject to review by the Supreme Court, except when the na\u00ad tional court's opinion is unanimous. The United States Supreme Court would remain supreme but would have to consider a con\u00ad stitutional question only once, on review or transfer from the 44. Haynsworth, note 38 supra. I would cut off the right to apply to the Supreme Court for certiorari to any petitioner who did not get a single affirmative vote in the new court. Rejected cases of that category are the chaff with which the Supreme Court should not be burdened by formal petitions. I cannot believe that any petitioner who fails to get at least one affirmative vote in the new court could reasonably expect to get four affirmative votes in the Supreme Court. This should not foreclose the use of screening panels provided the panels are instructed to pass on to the full court a petition if its merit or lack of merit is reasonably debatable. Id. at 843. 45.

Upholding the Position of State Courts A National Court of State Appeals would give speedy and consistent finality to state court decisions. It would avoid the present, demeaning practice of allowing federal trial judges to overturn the state supreme courts in criminal cases. This concern with the propriety of a trial court overruling an appellate court is not new. The National Advisory Commis\u00ad sion on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, in recommending that challenges to state court convictions be heard only by the United States courts of appeals, stated, \"That [recommenda\u00ad tion] is based upon the Commission's view that overturning a conviction that has already been upheld by the State's appellate court system is a step of such seriousness that it should not be performed by a single judge of a court with general trial jurisdic\u00ad tion.\"47 With the creation of a National Court of State Appeals, only a federal appellate court would be able to review and re\u00ad verse a state appellate court. In civil matters the National Court of State Appeals would be able to give greater consideration to the diversity of state court procedures and would not be concerned with both federal and state procedures. Although the United States Supreme Court tries to recognize state court - procedures, an appellate court with no federal court jurisdiction would be in a better po\u00ad sition to recognize the rich diversity of state laws and procedures which, though different, do not violate federal constitutional standards. C. Expansion of the Federal Judiciary As can be seen, this proposal would expand the federal judi\u00ad ciary by only nine judges, a de minimus increase in the number of federal judges. While there would be an appellate tier be\u00ad tween the state's highest court and the United States Supreme Court, the number of appellate courts between the federal dis\u00ad trict courts and the United States Supreme Court would remain the same. 47. NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMISSION ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE STANDARDS AND GOALS, REPORT ON COURTS 131 (1973) [hereinafter cited as REPORT ON COURTS]. 335 564 BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [1981 D. The New Court's Ability to Attract Competent Judges Since the National Court of State Appeals would be author\u00ad ized to take civil as well as criminal cases, it would not be a specialized court, a factor which should make service on the court more attractive. Service on the National Court of State Appeals would be more desirable than service on a court limited to criminal jurisdiction, as suggested by Judge Haynsworth.48 The judges should be appointed by the President pursuant to Article III of the United States Constitution. Since the National Court of State Appeals would be a truly national court and not a regional one, the salary should be greater than that of a judge on the United States Court of Appeals to ensure that the highest caliber of judge is attracted to the new court.49 E. The Manageability of the New Court's Docket A most critical question concerns the ability of the new court to handle the volume of cases that will be presented to it.50 The number of habeas corpus petitions in the federal district courts by state prisoners has remained fairly constant over the last ten years, as shown by the following chart:61 48. Haynsworth, supra note 38. 49. The method of selecting the judges of the new court has troubled previous sup\u00ad porters of a National Court of Appeals and seems to have had a chilling effect on past proposals for a national court. This problem could be overcome by providing initially for a form of merit selection as recommended by the American Judicature Society, and as provided in many states and as was followed in the selection of some federal circuit court judges during the Carter administration. There could also be an agreement that there be a balanced selection by the President between the political parties when the court is first appointed. 50. It should be kept in mind that the National Court of State Appeals would not have jurisdiction over civil rights petitions even if filed by state prisoners. These suits are independent actions in the federal district courts and would be reviewed by federal courts of appeal, as are all federal cases. 51. These and other statistics have been obtained from the 1980 Annual Report of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. It is noted that while the number of habeas corpus petitions in the federal district courts by state pris\u00ad oners has remained static, the number of civil rights petitions by state prisoners in fed-' eral district courts has increased: 1975 1976 6,128 6,958 7,752 11,195 12,397 Mandamus and other petitions decreased from 289 in 1975 to 146 in 1980. See ADMINIS\u00ad TRATIVE OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS, 1980 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR 62, table 21 [hereinafter cited as 1980 ANNUAL REPORT]. 336 545] NATIONAL COURT OF APPEALS 565 1971 8,372 7,833 7,949 1979 7,123 1975 7,843 1980 7,031 It should be remembered that very few of these habeas corpus petitions filed by state prisoners are of substance and require more than the briefest attention. These cases have been tried in the state trial court and have gone through a state appellate pro\u00ad cess and quite often through state postconviction procedures. The issues have been sufficiently refined so that they may be easily identified and quickly decided.82 Statistics of the United States Supreme Court are not very helpful in determining the source of that Court's work. They do indicate, however, that the total number of cases docketed be\u00ad tween 1976 and 1979 has remained under 5,000:M 1976 1977 1978 1979 4,730 4,704 4,731 4,781 52. A survey of 50 habeas corpus petitions by state prisoners filed in the United States District Court in Phoenix, Arizona, showed the following: Grounds for Petition (two petitions asserted more than one ground for relief): 1. Attack of underlying conviction 36 2. Probation revocation 4 3. Prison transfer 3 4. Loss of good time credits in prison 3 5. Parole eligibility 2 6. Held in jail after indictment quashed 2 7. Extradition 1 8. Medical mistreatment 1 Thirty of the 50 petitions were dismissed without the court's requiring either a response from the defendants or a hearing. The reasons were: 1. Availability of state remedies 14 2. No habeas corpus claim (i.e., wrong type of action, lack of jurisdiction, or alleged errors not of constitutional dimension) 8 3. Issue correctly decided on direct appeal 2 4. No specific facts alleged 2 5. Claim not related to present confinement 2 6. Moot 1 7. Claim disposed of previously by district court _1 30 Hearings were required in only three cases out of the remaining 20, and in only one case was relief granted. That case concerned a prisoner who had been sentenced for contempt of court, and that matter was remanded to the state for a new hearing on the contempt. 53. 1980 ANNUAL REPORT, supra note 51, at A-l, table A-l. 337 566 BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [1981 The Freund Commission provided more detailed information for the 1971-1972 Term.\" The report showed that out of a total of 4,371 cases docketed, 1,341, or 30.7%, originated in the state courts. Of this number, 445 were civil appeals and 896 were criminal appeals.\"8 If we assume that both the total caseload of the United States Supreme Court (under 5,000 cases a year) and the pro\u00ad portion of state cases to federal cases in the Court have re\u00ad mained substantially constant, approximately 1,500 cases pres\u00ad ently heard by United States Supreme Court would be heard instead by the National Court of State Appeals. When this figure is combined with the 7,000 or more habeas corpus peti\u00ad tions presently filed in the federal district courts, the maximum potential caseload for the National Court of State Appeals is 8,500 cases. Such a caseload would, even with excessive resort to staff, be prohibitive. It is submitted, however, that the actual caseload would be much less. It can be assumed that the present number of civil appeals from state court decisions will remain the same, about 500 a year. The number of criminal cases filed in the National Court of State Appeals will not, however, be as high as the number now filed in the federal district courts. Significantly fewer state prisoners will seek relief in a National Court of State Appeals than now seek relief in the federal district court; it is more diffi\u00ad cult and possibly more intimidating to file in a national court than it is to \"walk across the street\" to the local federal district court. Also, a time limit beyond which a state prisoner could not appeal from the fmal decision of the state court would signifi\u00ad cantly reduce the number of prisoners who could file in the na\u00ad tional court. This willingness or unwillingness of a state prisoner to seek relief in a National Court of Appeals cannot be proven conclu\u00ad sively, but an indication of it can be seen in the statistics com\u00ad piled by the Freund Commission. For the 1971 Term there were 1,721 criminal appeals to the United States Supreme Court from the United States courts of appeals.86 What proportion of these were state prisoner cases is not known, but the figure indicates the number of prisoners, state and federal, who were willing to 54. Freund Report, supra note 39, at J620, table V. 55. The term \"appeals\" includes both regular appeals and petitions for certiorari or habeas corpus. 56. Freund Report, supra note 39, at 620, table V. 338 545] NATIONAL COURT OF APPEALS 567 pursue an appeal to the United States Supreme Court from the United States courts of appeals. Another indication of the willingness of the state prisoners to appeal can be obtained from the number of present appeals to the United States courts of appeals from the federal district courts by state prisoners. In 1980, there were 1,090 criminal ap\u00ad peals filed in the United States courts of appeals by state prison\u00ad ers. In other words, the number of state prisoners who desired to proceed further from the ruling of the federal district courts to the United States courts of appeals was only slightly more than the number of state prisoners (896) who appealed from state courts directly to the United States Supreme Court in 1971. This may reflect the results of Stone v. Powell\" and Wainwright v. SykesM as well as the relief now believed to be afforded by the civil rights petition. The figures do indicate the degree of will\u00ad ingness of state prisoners to follow the appellate process from a state court decision. However, the federal district court is some\u00ad what different. The district court is nearer, and, being a trial court, there is more often the hope that the trial court will con\u00ad strue contested facts in the petitioner's favor. This is seldom done, but the hope blooms eternal. Such expectations do not usually extend to appellate courts. There is, however, another reason a National Court of State Appeals would not have to consider all of the 7,000 cases now filed in the federal district courts. That is the certainty of the law and its even application. Today, a state prisoner lives in the belief that he will find the \"right\" federal district judge. That this rarely happens is immaterial, as long as the belief remains. No longer will the prisoner be able to shop for the sympathetic judge. The law will be certain, and the prisoner will not file his petition in the National Court of State Appeals in hopes of get\u00ad ting some new or different law. Professor Schuman has stated: One reason why such a large percentage of criminal prosecu\u00ad tions are closed on a guilty plea without trial is that in most of these cases there is an extremely visible, rigid, appropriate (valid) statutory rule furnishing a standard to support the claim of the state and an absence of any standards to support the claim of the defendant.\" 57. 428 U.S. 465 (1976). 58. 420 U.S. 372 (1977). 59.

The state prisoners would be denied the hope of the \"luck of the draw\" now available in the federal district courts. Civil cases may well provide more of a problem for the court because of the substance of the cases. It should be remembered, however, that this would be a discretionary court, and even if it is assumed that 500 civil appeals a year are filed, not all will be heard and decided by written opinion. The number of civil cases that the National Court of State Appeals would have to con\u00ad sider, while sufficient to provide a well-rounded and interesting docket, would not be so large as to overwhelm the new court.60 The sum of the three figures discussed above yields an accu\u00ad rate estimate of the number of criminal appeals that would reach the National Court of State Appeals: (1) the number of direct criminal appeals by state prisoners to the United States Supreme Court in 1971 (896); (2) the number of criminal ap\u00ad peals by both state and federal prisoners from the United States courts of appeals to the United States Supreme Court in 1971 (1,721); and (3) the number of criminal appeals by state prison\u00ad ers to the United States courts of appeals from the roughly 7,000 decisions of the federal district courts in 1980 (1,090). The total number of criminal appeals by state prisoners from the decisions of the states' highest courts would be considerably less than the 7,000 cases now filed in the federal district courts. Giving the benefit of the doubt to the filing of an appeal, the total number of criminal cases appealed to the National Court of State Ap\u00ad peals by state prisoners should be fewer than 3,000, or three times the number of state prisoners who now take the trouble to appeal to the United States courts of appeals from the decisions of the federal district courts. Adding this figure to the estimated 60.

For a pessimistic projec\u00ad tion, if we allowed for an appeal to the National Court of State Appeals by half of the 7,000 state prisoners who now file in the federal district courts, the figure of 4,000 (3,500 criminal appeals plus 500 civil appeals) is still less than the United States Su\u00ad preme Court's present, more substantive caseload. F. The Constitutionality of the New Court One of the questions raised in opposition to the National Court of State Appeals is the constitutionality of depriving the federal district courts of the power to issue writs of habeas corpus involving state prisoners.81 This should not be a stum\u00ad bling block as long as there is an alternative forum that is rea\u00ad sonably accessible in which petitions for the writs can be heard. The Judiciary Act of 1789,92 gave the federal courts the power to issue writs of habeas corpus. The issuance of the writ, however, was limited only to prisoners held in custody by the United States. It would appear that the federal courts at that time limited the inquiry in habeas corpus cases to jurisdiction of the sentencing court.63 It wasn't until 1867, after the Civil War, that the scope of the writ was expanded to state prisoners, but even then the power was given only to the federal circuit courts and not to the federal district courts.*4 Federal circuit courts were authorized to give relief \"in all cases where any person [might] be restrained of his or her liberty in violation of the con\u00ad stitution, or any treaty or law of the United States. \"9B The scope of the writ was further expanded in the case of Frank v. Man- gum** to include proceedings in which a state defendant had been convicted in a trial which had been mob dominated. The scope of the writ was again judicially extended in Brown v. Al\u00ad len91 and in Fay v. Noia.M The United States Supreme Court 61. See note 43 supra. 62. See note 2 supra. 63. See Ex parte Watkins, 28 U.S. (3 Pet.) 193 (1830). 64.

Powell,\" stat\u00ad ing, \"[W]here the State has provided an opportunity for full and fair litigation of a fourth amendment claim, the Constitution does not require that a state prisoner be granted federal habeas corpus relief on the ground that evidence obtained in an uncon\u00ad stitutional search and seizure was introduced at his trial.\"70 Not only has the scope of the writ as to state prisoners been restricted by United States Supreme Court decisions, the juris\u00ad diction to issue the writ has been restricted by Congress. Section 2255 of the Federal Habeas Corpus Act provides that \"an appli\u00ad cation for writ of habeas corpus . . . , shall not be maintained,\" if the person has not availed himself of federal postconviction relief or has been denied such relief.71 The United States Su\u00ad preme Court case of Swain v. Pressley11 should be persuasive on this question. In that case the Court construed a statute that prohibited federal district courts from considering applications for writs of habeas corpus brought by a person in custody pursu\u00ad ant to sentence imposed by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. The United States Supreme Court stated: Respondent argues (footnote omitted) that \u00a7 110(g), if read lit\u00ad erally, violates Art. 1, \u00a7 9, cl. 2, of the United States Constitu\u00ad tion, which provides: The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or In\u00ad vasion the public Safety may require it. His argument is made in two steps: (1) that the substitution of a remedy that is not \"exactly commensurate\" with habeas corpus relief available in a district court is a suspension of the writ within the meaning of the Clause; and (2) that because the judges of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia do not enjoy the life tenure and salary protection which are guaran\u00ad teed to district judges by Art. Ill, \u00a7 1, of the Constitution, the collateral-review procedure authorized by \u00a7 23-110(g) of the District of Columbia Code is not exactly commensurate with habeas corpus relief in the district courts.\" The Supreme Court then held that the federal district court 69. 428 U.S. 465 (1976). 70.

This would eliminate further review in the U.S. district courts as is presently available.7* The National Court of State Appeals would provide the habeas corpus petitioner the same relief he presently receives. The only practical problem, as the Advisory Commission recog\u00ad nized, would be that the National Court of State Appeals, being an appellate court, could not conveniently hold hearings on is\u00ad sues of fact. Although the federal district courts, in fact, rarely do this now, usually relying upon the state record in the matter, some cases would need a factual determination to ensure that full relief is afforded. The National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals recommended that the circuit courts could refer matters to the trial court for factual determination where \"[t]he defendant asserts a claim of consti\u00ad tutional violation which, if well-founded, undermines the basis for or the integrity of the entire trial or review proceeding, or impairs the reliability of the factfinding process at the trial.\"77 Since this would be a National Court of State Appeals, any referral for an additional factual determination should be made to the state court rather than the federal district court. One of the problems with collateral attacks upon state court decisions in the federal district courts has been the difference in pleadings 74. Id. at 383-84. 75.

By referring any factual deter\u00ad mination back to the state court, the National Court of State Appeals would be assured that the state court files already in existence would be available and thus allow for a more consis\u00ad tent factual determination. In summary, there should be no constitutional impediment to taking jurisdiction of habeas corpus petitions by state prison\u00ad ers away from the federal district courts and giving it to the Na\u00ad tional Court of State Appeals. G. The New Court's Ability to Achieve Justice The thrust of this proposal is to satisfy the primary interest of the states in a system of federal review that will function with reasonable promptness, uniformity, and absolute finality. The cause of justice is served by these same goals. There must be an end to litigation. The sooner a matter is settled, the sooner the litigants can go on with their business, or the sooner a prisoner can concentrate on rehabilitation instead of dreaming, as he does now, that somewhere, someday he will find a federal district judge who will turn him loose and even recompense him for the violation of his civil rights by the state court. It should be remembered that, in criminal cases, by the time a prisoner reaches the federal courts, he has been given about all of the due process he is entitled to receive. The defen\u00ad dant has been found guilty by a jury or has pleaded guilty, often as a result of a plea agreement approved by the state court. The case has been reviewed by the state's appellate court, and the conviction has been affirmed. Frequently he has also been de\u00ad nied postconviction relief. Chief Justice Burger has noted, in discussing the cost and time involved in extended review of criminal convictions, \"The tragic aspect was the waste and futil\u00ad ity, since every lawyer, every judge and every juror was fully convinced of defendant's guilt from the beginning to the end.\"78 And Chief Justice Schaefer of Illinois has stated, \"What bothers me is that almost never do we have a genuine issue of guilt or innocence.\"19 If the chance that a defendant has a valid claim of 78.

Schaefer, Conference of the Center for the Study of Dem-344 545) NATIONAL COURT OF APPEALS 573 reversible error is extremely small, the chance that a defendant will have been convicted of a crime that he did not commit will be even smaller.80 And the fact that access to the United States Supreme Court would be reduced does not mean that justice will be denied. Justice Jackson stated: [Rjeversal by a higher court is not proof that justice is thereby better done. There is no doubt that if there were a super-Su\u00ad preme Court, a substantial proportion of our reversals of state courts would also be reversed. We are not final because we are infallible, but we are infallible only because we are final.81 In civil cases, although there are not the same number of frivolous appeals, the facts and issues will likewise have been distilled to the point that the constitutional questions are read\u00ad ily apparent, and the National Court of State Appeals could quickly decide whether to take the case. Here again the litigant has been before the state courts and through the state appellate process. The chance that he has been unjustly treated is small. Federal appellate review of state civil decisions serves more to clarify the law than to prevent injustice in a particular case. The proposal of a National Court of State Appeals would not be acceptable if, in operation, the court would damage the federal system or detract from the supremacy or prestige of the United States Supreme Court. This proposal would neither harm the federal system nor detract from the position of the United States Supreme Court. It would, however, provide an ex\u00ad tra number of authoritative federal law decisions upon which the states and others could rely with a reasonable expectation that they are final and binding. A National Court of State Appeals could review federal ocratic Institutions (June 1968), cited in Friendly, Is Innocence Irrelevant? Collateral Attack on Criminal Judgments, 38. U. CHI. L. REV. 142, 145 n.12 (1970). 80. It has been suggested that no petition for a writ of habeas corpus by a state prisoner in the federal court should be considered unless there is a colorable claim of innocence. There would be, of course, some exceptions to this rule: 1. Lack of jurisdiction in the traditional sense, for example, double jeopardy. 2. Where the error is one that could conceal from the trial court and the court on appeal the extent of the error: for example, inadequate or no representation by counsel, which could not only concern the degree of the crime, but also affect the severity of the sentence. 3. Where there has been a change in basic constitutional law. See Friendly, Is Innocence Irrelevant? Collateral Attack On Criminal Judgments, 38 U. CHI. L. REV. 142, 151-53 (1970). 81. Brown v.

Such a court would provide swifter and more consistent justice for the people that both the federal and state courts must serve. VII. SOME QUESTIONS A. Time Limits There is a question as to what, if any, time limits should be placed upon a person seeking national court review of state court decisions. One of the purposes of a National Court of State Appeals would be to bring litigation to a conclusion within a rea\u00ad sonable time. It is proposed that a person seeking relief from a decision of the state's highest court be required to do so within ninety days of final action by the state court. This should work no hardship on the litigant and would ensure that the court would not be burdened with reviewing stale decisions. In crimi\u00ad nal cases, if there is a change in the law or there is newly discov\u00ad ered evidence, these matters can be first litigated in the state courts through state postconviction procedures, and the petition to the National Court of State Appeals would be based upon the denial of relief by the state's highest court. B. Distance and Increased Costs Another objection that has been made is the increased costs involved in having to travel to the National Court of State Ap\u00ad peals to argue cases that previously were argued in the local dis\u00ad trict court or the United States courts of appeals. For some, this would admittedly be a burden. But cost alone should not be the basis for allowing federal trial judges to sit in judgment of state appellate courts. Moreover, there are some solutions to the cost factor. First, the enacting legislation could allow the National Court of State Appeals to travel and hear cases at selected places around the country. This is done by appellate courts in many states and has been beneficial to both the court and the litigants. Second, with the increased use of technology, provi\u00ad sions could be made for oral argument by video phone. In\u00ad creased use of technology and a willingness on the part of the National Court of State Appeals to travel should eliminate some of the additional costs that may be incurred by the litigants in seeking appeal to a national court rather than a federal district court. Actually, there will be a saving of both time and cost in 346 545) NATIONAL COURT OF APPEALS 575 most cases in that the litigation route from the state's highest court to the National Court of State Appeals and then to the United States Supreme Court involves one less step than the present procedure from the state's highest court to the Federal District Court, to the United States Court of Appeals, and then to the United States Supreme Court. All of this usually occurs after a prior petition to the United States Supreme Court from the state's highest court has been denied by the United States Supreme Court. VIII. CONCLUSION There will always be some tension between the federal courts and the state courts in the exercise of the supremacy clause by the federal judiciary. Accepting this tension as the log\u00ad ical result of our dual system of courts does not mean that this power and obligation on the part of federal courts to review state court decisions on federal questions should be used to the unnecessary detriment of the state court systems or the litigants. State courts are entitled to prompt and consistent review of their decisions. They are not now receiving such review and in\u00ad deed cannot receive it under the present procedure. It may be that the burden of multiple review by the federal courts is an even greater burden on the federal judiciary than it is on the state judiciaries. But it is a burden to both, and there exists in both systems a need for reasonably prompt and consistent re\u00ad view of state court decisions involving federal questions. A Na\u00ad tional Court of State Appeals would satisfy that need. Whatever the mistakes of the past, state courts are aware that the federal judiciary will step in when federal constitutional law is ignored by the states. Restricting the power of the federal district courts to interfere in state appellate court decisions and transferring that power to a National Court of State Appeals will be a step in ensuring consistency and prompt finality in state court decisions. The system and the litigants deserve noth\u00ad ing less. 347 576 BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW (1981 APPENDIX Total Compilation of Questionnaire Results Number of Questionnaires \u2014 500 Number of Replies \u2014 252 1.

Fed\u00ad eral funding of state judiciaries has. (hen, come about more by accident than by design. When the Conference of Chief Jus\u00ad tices first confronted the issue of fed\u00ad eral funding in 1974. it already had been structured as a problem of the (1978) under-funding of state judicial branch programs by the Law Knliirecmem As\u00ad sistance Adminisiraiion.

BURGER CKEEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES AMERICAN LAW INSTITUTE HYATT REGENCY HOTEL WASHINGTON, D. C. JUNE JO, 19S0 353 This is the eleventh year you have allowed me access to this unique forum of our profession, and on this occasion I will not detain you unduly long. What I hope to do is what Judge Charles Clark suggested in his Cardozo Lecture, that is, I will try, in his words, \"... to suggest problems and raise doubts rather than resolve confusion; to disturb thought, rather than dispense legal or moral truth.\" I come not as an advocate, as I have done in some prior years, but rather \u2014 with Charlie Clark \u2014 simply \"to raise doubts.\" In a sense, it may be symbolic that for the first time in many, many years you meet in June and at the modern Hyatt Regency Hotel rather than in mid-day at the grand old Mayflower. This should remind us that things do change. We know that changes in our society often go virtually unnoticed until they have become a fixed part of the structure and changes in the law exhibit this same characteristic. But changes in the law and litigation patterns do not burst forth like that volcano which recently caused billions of dollars in damage and the loss of many lives. Changes in the law come silently, and, like a glacier, the movement is almost imperceptible, often first emerging in an obscure case that goes unnoticed. We need only recall how long it took for i lawyers and scholars to see the meaning of Erie v. Tompkins to remind us that changes are not always perceived immediately. Fortunately for all of us, scholars, with more time to scan the whole panorama, and more time for reflection than is allowed to lawyers and judges, may discern a new trend or a new concept \u2014 and it is sometimes a new trend that was not intended. In recent years we have read news reports of what some see as \"bizarre cases\": a son suing his parents for damages for their negligence in his upbringing; another son suing his parents for a \"divorce\" \u2014 which I suspect a court might construe as an application for a declaratory judgment of emancipation; students suing teachers demanding judicial review of grades received. Another headline novel case was brought by a lady seeking a division of community property from a gentleman for whom she had been what we lawyers might call a de facto wife, although she made.no claim to a common-law marriage. We read of women employees suing their employers for unwelcome attentions, but that is probably an improvement over the self-help of earlier times when ladies used hat pins to deal with such problems. 354 1 am not suggesting by any means that all novel or even bizarre cases are necessarily \"bad\". Some may be aberrations but others may contain the seeds of future change. The first time someone sued a king, for example, it no doubt provoked gales of mirth in the alehouses or wherever lawyers congregated in those days. And we recall that Lord Coke literally put his head on the block when he told his king that the law was superior to the monarch. Of course, Coke shrewdly softened the blow by adding \"just as I am beneath your majesty.\" Yet Coke's daring statement was probably one of the first breaches in the doctrine of sovereign immunity, even if it was not so perceived at the time. So new is not bad, and we must be prepared to deal with change \u2014 and, if possible, anticipate it. At the St. Paul Conference in 1976, which has come to be known as \"The Pound Revisited Conference\", more than 300 representative leaders of the legal profession \u2014 and other disciplines as well -- tried to inquire into the problems that will confront courts in the final quarter of this century. At best, I suspect, we did no more than scratch the surface, but after all that is what Roscoe Pound did in 1906. One of the speakers was Simon Rifkind, who has been an active participant in the law for a half century, on the bench, at the counsel table and as a counselor. His theme was that the federal courts are victims of their own success. I took him to mean that federal courts were thought more likely to provide remedies which could not be achieved by the political processes or in the state courts. This morning I will try to present a very tentative perception about federal and state jurisdiction, a subject which the Institute has addressed on prior occasions. I can cite no empirical data acceptable to the scientific mind, but numerous conversations with colleagues of the state and federal bench, along with published articles and lectures, suggest that significant changes are taking place in patterns of litigation in both the federal and state courts. I think I perceive, in dim outline \u2014 but I am not certain \u2014 signs that state court dockets and federal dockets are becoming more and more alike. It is surely plain by now that both federal and state courts share the burdens of what has been called \"the litigation explosion.\" Some thoughtful observers tell us that this enormous expansion of litigation is a result of the failure of the political processes to meet the peoples' 355 expectations. This is not the time or place to explore the source or scope of those expectations. But it is reasonably clear that in the past two decades peoples' expectations have indeed been fanned to new heights \u2014 heights which some social scientists, and others, see as beyond what our society can provide. I leave that to the political scientists and economists. My point this morning is far narrower than these cosmic political and philosophical questions. What I ask is whether the signs some discern mean that the federal system may be on its way to a de_ facto merger with the state court systems, with litigants free in most, If not all, cases to choose a federal court or a state court, depending on the condition of the dockets and depending upon what they perceive as to the quality of relief they may obtain? I put that as a question. In the past decade Congress has enacted not less than 70 new statutes enlarging the jurisdiction of federal courts. Many of these statutes expand federal jurisdiction to cover relief already available in state courts. It is fair to say that the federal courts, and ultimately the Supreme Court, have tended to give expansive, rather than restricted, interpretation to these statutes, along with a narrowing of the scope of immunity of government officials. A number of thoughtful observers, including our colleague Carl McGowan, have noted, for example, that the federal courts have given new and expanded meaning to the requirements of standing. Writing in The American Bar Journal four years ago, Judge McGowan pointed to another, but related, development: \"Progressive relaxation of judicially created requirements of standing have enabled almost any person to get into [federal] courts to complain about almost any act, or omission to act, in the whole spectrum of federal activities. But the capacity of the courts to reverse that relaxation is now being impaired by a spectacularly increasing tendency on the part of Congress to provide explicitly for federal court remedies and judicial review ...\" This is confirmed by my own discovery only a few days ago that New York City is second only to the United States as a litigant in the southern district of New York. And you may be sure New York City is not the plaintiff in very many of those cases. 356 Judge McGowan concluded with these words: The current congressional love affair with federal jurisdiction is heating up rather that cooling.\" We have made an effort, but not with extraordinary success, to have the Congress require its committees, in reporting out legislation, to provide the full Congress with an impact statement predicting, or at least making an estimate \u2014 an informed guess \u2014 as to the possible or likely impact of new legislation on the federal courts. Another colleague, former Attorney General Griffin Bell, stated in a recent interview that he had insisted that the Department of Justice, in sponsoring legislation, provide the Congress with an impact statement. There has been no stampede to emulate Griffin Bell. I hasten to acknowledge, of course, that it is the Congress under the constitution that defines the jurisdiction of the federal courts. We know that 50, or 100, or 150 years ago, there was a very marked difference between the litigation in state and federal courts. What I am pointing to is the perception of some that there are signs of a merging of the two judicial systems. We might say these are early warning signals. This perception may be wrong. These observers may be in the position of a small boy looking down a stretch of straight railroad tracks when, by optical illusion, the rails seem to converge. But this perception is not frivolous. Like symptoms of illness, we ignore them at our peril. For more than a half century The American Law Institute has taken the long view of problems and has contributed immeasurably to the improvement of the law with its model codes, restatements of law and other studies, along with programs of legal education. Certainly one of the most monumental contributions was the 1969 study of allocation of jurisdiction. That report focused on allocation of jurisdiction between the state and federal courts as to specific and relatively narrow jurisdictional, venue and procedural problems. The introductory statement of that report, you recall, tells the reader that: 357 \"The Institute accepted the thesis that there are basic principles of federalism and that it is essential to allocate judicial business between state and federal courts in.the light of those principles.\" It goes on: \"A reappraisal from time to time of the structure of our judicial system is appropriate, but the present inquiry has a special urgency because of the continually expanding workload of the federal courts and the delay of justice resulting therefrom.\" The draftsman of that introductory statement must be appalled at what has happened since the day when this statement was drafted. Progress in implementing the Institute's 1969 recommendation has not been spectacular, but neither has it been static. The Congress substantially eliminated the three-judge district courts, but it has not eliminated diversity jurisdiction, as it has not eliminated the Sipreme Court's mandatory appellate jurisdiction, which the Judicial Conference has urged. The latter has met with no objections or opposition, and although unopposed, the corrective legislation is \"hostage\" to the prayer amendment, whose subject matter relevance eludes even those \"professors in New England\" Alex Bickel spoke of. Yet even this minimum progress is not to be disparaged for we remember that Chief Justice Jay advocated the creation of separate federal courts of appeals in 1791 and John Marshall pressed that subject for the entire 34 years of his tenure. Congress finally responded \u2014 in 18911 -- A century of progress no less! If these perceptions as to a possible merger are accurate, there are at least two consequences, both of which may be upon us before we even discern them fully so as to be able to grapple with them. First, we may see an irreversible erosion of what the Institute in 1969 called \"basic principles of federalism\". Federal courts were created to provide a forum for certain, narrow, identifiable disputes involving rights and obligations. Under the genius of our system of federalism, such special and limited cases were thought more likely to receive full protection and review from a national court 358 system. To assert this is in no sense to disparage state courts, where the overwhelming bulk of cases are litigated. A second consequence of this almost imperceptible trend toward merger of state and federal jurisdiction \u2014 if indeed such a trend is a reality \u2014 is that the bar may lose interest in its obligation to work for the improvement of state courts and those courts may well atrophy. There are now ten times as many state trial judges of general jurisdiction as there are federal trial judges. Those who wish to open the federal courts for every cause of action, merely out of the self-interest of their clients, may be unwittingly laying foundations for a vast increase in the number of federal judges \u2014 numbers never before contemplated. If we are disposed to enlarge the federal court system to provide a total, or almost total, concurrence of jurisdiction, the trend, unchecked, is the way to achieve that result. For my part, I would greatly prefer to maintain the federal courts as tribunals of special and limited jurisdiction as the founding fathers contemplated in 1787 and as the Institute confirmed in its seminal 1969 report. I remind you again of the introductory statement of the 1969 report that: \"A reappraisal from time to time of the structure of our [whole] judicial system is appropriate ...\" What I now raise for your consideration is whether the time has come for a broader reappraisal of the allocation of jurisdiction, with special focus on the developments that have emerged since the study was begun two decades ago. It will do us no good in 1999 to look back and conclude that a trend indeed began in the 1950's or 1960's to assimilate the two judicial systems, and that nearly two centuries of tested concepts of allocation of jurisdiction were abandoned without conscious intent. I have been discussing \u2014 in a serious vein \u2014 differences in jurisdiction which may be disappearing. And now, less seriously, if these random observations have not reminded you of one of Paul Freund's stories they have done so for me. Paul tells of the lady who asked an Anglican bishop about the differences between Cherubim and Seraphim. The Anglican Bishop replied, \"Madam, at one time there were indeed differences but the differences have been composed and all is well.\" 359 i/28/80- STATEMENT BEFORE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE SEMINAR Williamsburg, Virginia January 20, 1980 Frank J. Remington When I was first contacted over a year ago and asked to assist in the preparation of a proposal for federal financial assistance to state judicial systems, I was hesitant to become involved because I felt not sufficiently well informed with respect to the merits of the issue and I was skeptical whether a persuasive case could ever be made in favor of direct federal financial assistance for the improvement of state judicial systems. I was skeptical for at least four reasons: (1) First, it has become increasingly apparent that most difficult social and governmental problems cannot be solved merely by spending more money. (2) Second, federal grant programs have too often been characterized by so great a proliferation of rules and regulations that the time and effort required to obtain a grant could better be spent in other ways. (3) Third, with federal grant money has come federal control that can create a problem for state government and particularly for state judicial systems 360 that need to be a separate and largely independent branch of government. (4) Finally, I was skeptical because I could think of no persuasive reason why the federal Congress should contribute directly to the improvement of state judicial systems. However, it is difficult to say no to a chief justice\u2014impossible to say no to several chief justices as persuasive as Justices Utter, Sheran of Minnesota, and I'Anson of Virginia. In the past year I have become better informed with respect to the merits; I have been completely persuaded that there is a principled basis for direct federal financial support of some aspects of the work of state courts; and I have become at least cautiously optimistic that federal funds can be spent by state judicial systems in ways that will make significant contribution to the improvement in the quality of state court justice without sacrificing the independence of the state courts. I want to direct my remarks to the question of whether there is a principled basis for asking the Congress to make direct financial contribution to the 361 improvement of state judicial systems. Chief Justice Utter will speak to the question of whether the availa\u00ad bility of federal funds will in fact make significant improvement in the quality of justice rendered by state courts. I hope that it will become clear that the question of whether there is a persuasive basis for federal support of state courts has significance not only for the Congress, but also for the executive and judicial branches of the federal government. 1 became convinced that to say that there is an important federal interest in the quality of justice furnished by state courts is to assert the obvious. Nothing is more important to a democratic society than confidence by its citizens that they will receive a high quality of justice in court, state as well as federal. This is particularly true and particularly difficult to achieve in a highly diverse society such as ours. Important as are health and education and a good environment\u2014all recipients of substantial federal financial support\u2014they are no more essential to the nation than to have all citizens confident that they can find fairness and justice and proper concern for 362 constitutional principles in the state courts where 98 percent of the cases are handled. This reason alone, it seems to me, would justify federal financial assistance to state courts where such assistance can contribute significantly to the quality of justice. But there are other reasons also. State courts have historically had a responsibility to enforce the requirements of the United States Constitution and the laws of the United States made in pursuance thereof. This is required by the supremacy clause of the Constitution. State courts have concurrent jurisdiction to enforce congressional legislation except where there is a congressional purpose to make federal court jurisdiction exclusive, and this has not often been done. In a real sense, therefore, the effective implementation of federal law requires that state courts have the capacity to know what the federal law is and to understand how it should be applied in a wide variety of cases. This is obviously no easy task for the state court judge, and it seems evident that there is a direct federal interest in assisting the state judge in acquiring the knowledge and other resources necessary to ensure the effective implementation of federal law. ot>3 5 Although the federal interest in state courts has long existed, there have been recent changes that make the federal interest in state courts today more important than ever before. Actions at the federal level, in recent times, have significantly increased the burden of state courts and significantly increased the direct federal interest in the effectiveness of state judicial systems. These actions have been of three general sorts: First, the Congress has increasingly relied upon state courts to implement congressional legislation. The nationwide 55-mile-per-hour speed limit is perhaps the most obvious illustration. A large number of addi- 2 tional illustrations can be cited. Second, federal executive agencies and federal courts have diverted an increasing number of matters to state courts in order to maintain the small, high 3 quality character of the federal justice system. The federal government formerly prosecuted interstate auto theft; it no longer does so, and the trend toward increased reliance upon the states continues and is increasing. The federal government now gives low or no 364 6 priority to bank robbery in the view that\u2014as the attorney general said\u2014it is a \"state crime dressed in federal clothing.\" As with the proposal to eliminate diversity jurisdiction, one could say that business that should have been the responsibility of the state courts all along is being returned to the states. But it is not evident that bank robbery is a state responsi\u00ad bility alone\u2014any more than it is that the federal Civil Rights Act is a federal responsibility only, though one state court said, in the past, that this was the case. Cooperation is a two-way street. The reduction of federal prison population from 32,000 to 25,000 (re\u00ad ported to us by Norm Carlson, director of the United States Bureau of Prisons) is encouraging, but at what cost to state courts? Federal courts have decided to no longer review state fourth amendment decisions where 4 the state has given a \"full and fair hearing. Justice Brennan recently said, \"[T]hese decisions . . . have significantly altered the work of state court judges .... With federal scrutiny diminished, state courts must respond by increasing their own.\" 365 7 As many as forty-one state courts have recently held that the state court has jurisdiction to hear cases brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983 (the federal Civil Rights Act). Yesterday Judge Rubin said federal courts should concentrate on those cases for which there are no other courts available and those where other courts are less capable of doing an adequate job. Control of the volume of federal court business thus requires an increase in the capacity of state courts to handle cases now left to federal courts. If this happens, perhaps exhaustion of state judicial remedies in 1983 cases will be feasible. I anticipate increased reliance upon state courts in 1983 cases where the decision of the state court is res judicata and cannot be relitigated in a federal court, and thus the enforcement of federal civil rights is left entirely to the state court. The increased reliance upon state courts results in part from the substantial backlog in many federal courts, a problem of delay in the civil docket that is likely to increase (as Maury Rosenblum predicted during this conference) as the sanctions of the Speedy Trial Act 25-622 0-84-24 366 8 go into effect on July 1, 1980\u2014sanctions that will require that federal criminal cases be given even greater priority than they are given today. Third, federal courts have imposed increasing procedural due process requirements on state courts in both criminal and civil cases. There was a time when a plea of guilty could be taken in state court in a couple of minutes. Today compliance with federally imposed requirements results in a much more lengthy and more difficult guilty plea procedure, and it is obviously more important that the requirements of the procedure be understood and complied with by the state 8 court judge. Recent cases, such as Sandstrom v. Montana, require that state jury instructions on the mental state required be rewritten, and it is very likely that all first degree murder cases where the offender is still in prison will have to be retried. There was a time, not many years ago, when federal court review of state court convictions was resented and resisted by state judges. This is much less true today when there is a much greater willingness to implement federal requirements. The chief justice pointed to the fact that the federal-state councils 367 have materially reduced the tension between federal and state judges. But the task of applying federal law is difficult, and the burden on the individual state trial judge is an impossible one unless that judge has more help through continuing education, the availability of model jury instructions, and the development of more effective trial and pretrial procedures. Chairman Rodino said in his opening remarks that it is increas\u00ad ingly difficult for the federal judge to keep abreast of the \"law explosion.\" The same difficulty faces the state judge, a difficulty aggravated by the tendency to leave to state courts much of what has\u2014in the past- been handled by federal courts. I have had the opportunity of meeting for two days a month for about twenty years with a group of Wisconsin trial judges responsible for the preparation of materials that will help the trial judge handle his increasingly complex responsibility. This complexity results in large part from changes required by the federal govern\u00ad ment. 368 11 footnotes FOOTNOTES 1.

As a result, there is increased need for carefully worked out state commitment procedures and improved judicial education to ensure adequate implementation of the new, more complex procedures. 8. 99 S.

Meador*) THE ROBERT HOUGHWOUT JACKSON LECTURE BEFORE THE NATIONAL COLLEGE OF THE STATE JUDICIARY1 To be asked to participate In the Robert II. Jackson Lecture scries Is a distinct . privilege for any luwyer. Justice Jackson was one of the eminent lawyers and judges of our day. He provides an enduring model of professional competence and integrity. Among his many qualities I think most often of his analytical mind and his mastery of the English language. I saw Justice Jackson only twice. In Septem\u00ad ber 1954, shortly after I had arrived to clerk for Justice Hugo Black, he dropped by to chat. A couple of weeks later, I passed him In tlio corridors of the Supreme Court when he was on the way to a Court conference. Five days later he was dead. The law clerks for all the justices sat together at his funeral in the National Cathedral in Washington. Seventeen years later, almost to the week, I was again at a funeral In National Cathedral, this time for Justice Black. In my memory's eye, these two strong-minded men are linked In this curious way. They had a genuine respect for each other, despite all of the controversy that swirled about them at one time. It is also a privilege to participate in this Lecture series because it gives me an opportunity to visit the National College of the State Judiciary. Nothing more clearly symbolizes the new era in the American judiciary than does the flourishing activity in judicial education especially as embodied in this institution. Twenty years ago this was unknown. It is now clearly an Idea whose time has come. There is a substantial rising interest in formal educational programs for judges at all levels of the judiciary, state and federal. This Is one of the most promising signs that the American courts, while beset with troubles of many sorts, are alive and thriving, with the promise of continued vitality. All of you are to be congratulated on participating in this essential aspect of a career on the bench today. Out of a wide range of subjects which we could usefully discuss, I have chosen to talk about the federal government and the state courts. This Is a subject in which you and I presently have a mutual interest, and it is a subject which raises provocative questions about the future shape of American government. Trends are afoot which could lead us to quite a different governmental arrangement from that which we have known in our own time and indeed from the beginning of our constitutional government. This subject can be put into perspective by starting with a brief review of history. Then we can survey the contemporary scene, underscoring the changes which have come alwut in the mid-20th century and noting the significant trends. Finally, I shall attempt to peer through the mist of the fuure and suggest some possibilities which may He ahead. . In many respects the evolution of the state courts' relationship, to the federal government is part of the general evolution of government in this country. Most discussions of that subject, however, focus on executive and legislative powers. Little attention lias been given specifically to the peculiar relationships of the state judicial systems and the federal government as n whole. It Is hardly a secret that the slate courts today occupy a radically altered position in relation\u00ad ship to the federal government than that which they occupied originally and for well over a century after the formation of the federal union. But the full dimen\u00ad sions and the ramifications of the changes may not be widely understood. It Is my belief that we are in a transition period which could lead to a judicial struc\u00ad ture quite different from the original state-federal design. We begin with some elementary observations. Wben the members of the Con\u00ad stitutional Convention convened in Philadelphia In 1787, courts already existed in the thirteen newly independent states. Each of the states was an autonomous entity. Each had its own courts, with a structure and a jurisprudence largely inherited from England, though heavily infused with North American frontier customs and conditions. At that time, each state was like England itself, in that each had a unitary government and unitary set of courts. There was no federal overlay or dual governmental structure such as that brought Into being by the work of those men in Philadelphia. Assistant Attorney General of the United States. The views expressed here nre those of the lecturer nnd do not necessarily represent the position of the Department of Justice or of the Attorney General. 374 The adoption of the Constitution and the passage of the Judiciary Act of 1789 set the stage for all that has followed. The Constitution created a dual sovereignty throughout the United States. Alongside of, or on top of, the state courts, a federal judicial system was erected. But for many decades the position of the state judiciaries was not altered very much. In the beginning, the trial courts of the new federal system were given very little jurisdiction that impinged in nny way upon the state courts. Perhaps the most important element of change at the trial lovcl was the nhlft of admiralty jurisdiction from the state courts over to the new federal district courts. The Supreme Court was given jurisdiction to review state court judg\u00ad ments, but this power wus exercised only scantily for many yenrs. In the first decade of its existence, the Supreme Court reviewed only seven state court decisions, and for the next several decades It reviewed about an average of one state Judgment a year. The state Judges, by virtue of the Federal Supremacy clause, were compelled to apply federal law whenever It came into play, but federal law was so skimpy in the early decades that this posed little or no added burden on the state judges. There was, of course, no remote hint from the begin\u00ad ning and throughout the 19th century of any federal funding for the state judi\u00ad ciaries. Any suggestion along that line would likely have been thought of as subversive or revolutionary or the product of a deranged mind. Thus, in an oversimplified way, it might be said that for nearly a century after the creation of the federal union the only impingement of the federal government on the state courts was the occasional review by the U.S. Supreme Court of a State Supreme Court decision. Otherwise, the state courts went their way largely unaffected by the coexistence of the federal government The situation began to change\u2014and the seeds for radical alteration were planted\u2014in the wake of that water shed disaster in American history, the War Between the States and Reconstruction. The state judiciaries were directly affected by the great upsurge of national sentiment and increasing assertions of federal authority which occurred during that era. A major development was the opening of the federal trial courts to some business which had always been handled exclusively by the state courts. For example, in the late 1860's Con\u00ad gress broadened removal to the federal courts of diversity of citizenship cases. And, in that same period, Congress for the first time provided writs of habeas corpus for persons detained under state authority. Most significant of all was the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, imposing directly upon the states, as a matter of federal law, the constraints of due process and equal protection. The immediate effect of these measures was not great, but in the long run they have served to channel to the federal district courts a lurge volume of litigation which would otherwise have been confined to the state courts, subject only to the possibility of U.S. Supreme Court review of the final state judgment. More was yet to come. In 1875, Congress enacted, for the first time; a general provision authorizing federal trial courts to entertain suits arising under federal law. It is anomalous that up until that time there had been no general federal question jurisdiction in the federal trial courts. The 1875 provision has had enormous consequences on the business of both the state and federal courts. Since that time, plaintiffs with claims based on federal law have lieen able to initiate actions in the federal courts, rather than In the state courts, and they have done so in vastly increasing numbers in recent decades. This 1875 jurisdictional grant combined with the Fourteenth Amendment to produce the 1908 Supreme Court's decision in ex parte Young. That decision held that federal courts could enjoin state officials from conduct in violation of the Constitution. It worked an enormous shift of authority. In effect, It put the federal district courts in the business of supervising the constitutionality of state official activity. A federal trial court with authority to hear evidence, de\u00ad cide facts, and issue Injunctions is armed with a powerful device, one fur more potent than U.S. Supreme Court review of a final state supreme court judgment. Constitutional questions which would previously have been decided Initially by the state courts are thus channeled instead through the federal system. Not only has this given the federal courts a vastly enhanced amount of business, but it has also shifted ultimate authority over many important economic and social questions into the hands of the federal judiciary. It was not until the middle of this century that the full fruits of the 1807 habeas corpus statute materialized. That statute, combined with the Fourteenth Amendment, has now been interpreted by the Supreme Court to permit federal 375 district courts to review state criminal cases in a pervasive way. Any federal Constitutional issue concerning the state criminal process can now be asserted In the federal trial courts following an otherwise final state court conviction. The range of those issues has also been broadened considerably through the Supreme Court's expanded construction of the Fourteenth Amendment, as applied to the state criminal process. Here again is a major reallocation of state-federal authority, about as large as that worked by ex parte Young. The federal judiciary has acquired vastly enhanced powers to supervise the state courts in criminal cases. The last major development I wish to cite is the blossoming of Section 1983. Between 1875 ond 1939, there were only 19 reported cases brought in the federal courts under this statute. Last year alone, however, 7,752 were filed In the fed\u00ad eral courts. In effect, this statute, as presently construed, converts many stnto tort and proiwrty cases into Constitutional cases thereby opening the way for their litigation in the federal district courts. These sketchy highlights from our history are enough to underscore a huge growth in federal judicial business, much of which has been diverted from the state courts. These highlights also show a greatly enhanced federal judicial power over all aspects of state activity. The growth and relative power of the federal judiciary is consistent with the general pattern of growth of federal power in other areas over the last hundred years, and particularly in the middle decades of the 20th century. There have been only two developments inconsistent with this pattern. One was the Supreme Court's decision in 1938 in Erie R.R. v. Tompkins, holding that state decisional law was to be as binding on federal judges as state statutory law. This meant that in diversity of citizenship cases federal courts were no longer to exercise an independent, creative common law function in formulating decisional rules. The Erie decision reallocated power to the state courts; it made the state courts the authoritative expositors of state common law. Federal judges were to follow them in diversity cases, which after all involve essentially state law questions. This holding deprived the federal judges of a large power of creative development of common law doctrine, and shifted responsibility for that back into the state courts. Diversity jurisdiction itself is the subject of the other development which promises to shift back to the state courts a large amount of business. Bills are now pending in Congress to restrict that jurisdiction in one degree or another and it is likely that this Congress will enact a bill which will limit federal diversity jurisdiction nt least to some extent. If so, a significant number of cases will be reallocated to the state courts. However, in no single state will the volume be huge. The Conference of Chief Justices, at their annual meeting last August, adopted a resolution stating that the state courts are prepared and willing to assume whatever Increased volume of business results from the restriction of federal diversity jurisdiction. But even assuming a restriction of federal diversity jurisdiction and consider\u00ad ing the Eric decision, we are still left with a substantial net gain in federal judicial business and power, compared to the situation which existed a century ago. The Rtate courts, nevertheless, remain with large and ever growing volumes of business. Our system is still structured on the basic premise that the state courts are the primary forums for deciding the controversies which arise in the great mass of day-to-day dealings among citizens. Contract, tort, property, domestic relations, and criminal law matters are all still dealt with largely by the state courts. In sheer volume, the totality of federal court business ie enormously greater than the totality of federal court business. Moreover, !n numbers of judges, the state court systems far exceed the federal system. Thus far we have been speaking largely of a net growth of federal jurisdiction. But this does not revpal the full dimensions of the present relationship between the federal niul the state courts. At the same time that federal judicial power has Increased, the state and federal court systems are drawing closer together. There are now more points of contact between the state and federal court systems. There is also growing uniformity in the law being applied by both and in the rules of procedures being used. Some forty Rtates have adopted rules of civil procedure which are virtually identical to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Greater uniformity in the law of evidence may likewise follow the adoption of the Federal Rules of Evidence. 376 Some of the growing uniformity In the law being applied by both systems is the result of decisions under the Fourteenth Amendment. In criminal cases, for exam\u00ad ple, there has developed a closer relationship between federal and state law en\u00ad forcement procedures and both state and federal courts decide a large number of identical due process and equal protection questions. Another example Is diversity cases, in which federal courts are deciding issues of law identical to those being decided in the state courts. FELA cases may be brought in both state and federal courts so that both systems decide those matters. Litigation Involving the legality of state official action takes place In both systems. In addition, there is growing uniformity of the law among the states. Largely as a result of the work of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, much state law has been revised resulting in a higher degree of na\u00ad tionwide uniformity. And the American Law Institute continues its work on the restatements thereby encouraging uniformity in development of the common lnw. It is fair to say that the courts of the nation, state and federal, are today decid\u00ad ing more legal questions in common than ever before. Also, there is greater pos\u00ad sibility now for federnl Judicial involvement In matters which formerly would have been the exclusive province of the state courts. There are other developments pulling the systems closer together. The Confer\u00ad ence of Chief Justices more and more concerns itself with federal matters and federal-state relationships. This body also serves to pull together the judiciaries of all the states. The state and federal judges in 40 states have formed judicial councils which facilitate continuing contact and dialogue between the two systems at the state level. Also, recognizing an identity of many of their concerns, the appellate judges of the federal courts have joined state appellate judges in n single, voluntary association within the American Bar Association. It lias been suggested that state and federal trial judges do the same. The National College of the State Judiciary is a growing and effective force for homogenizing the state judges nationwide. Another significant development in this unfolding saga of our dual court sys\u00ad tems is the creation of a national center for each. In December 1967, the Federal Judicial Center was established followed in 1972 by the National Center for State Courts. These two central, national Centers have many interests In common and they have collaborated on a variety of projects and activities. The existence of these Centers makes it possible for the federal and state judiciaries to Inter\u00ad relate in ways that would not have been possible without them and increasing collaboration is predictable. Moreover, like the Conference of Chief Justices and the National College of the State Judiciary, the National Center for State Courts serves In a new way to unify the 50 state court systems. The accretion of federal jurisdiction, the growing dominance of the federal judiciary and the drawing together of the two systems are reminiscent of develop\u00ad ments in England centuries ago. After the Normans arrived and established the seeds of a central national government, there arose in England for the llrst time some central, national courts\u2014Common Pleas, King's Bench, and the Exchequer. But at the beginning and for many, many years, these courts had very limited jurisdiction. The great bulk of everyday dispute settlement rested in the local courts of various sorts\u2014county courts, federal courts, and others. Gradually, however, as the centuries passed, the Jurisdiction of the central courts increased. By various procedural inventions and Actions they drew unto themselves an ever increasing amount of judicial business which previously had been in the hands of the local courts. Ultimately, the local courts were eclipsed, and the central courts became all embracing in their authority. Whether the trends which we observe in this country will lead to such a result Is one of the fascinating questions to ponder. There nre some parallels. For ex\u00ad ample, one of the Instruments used In England by the central royal courts to gather jurisdiction was the writ of habeas corpus. Through that writ, cases could be taken from the local tribunals over Into the central conrts. As noted above, It is largely through the habeas corpus writ that we have developed what has been characterized as the federalization of the state criminal process. The superimposing of Constitutional doctrine on state tort and property law, through Section 1983 actions, also has some parallels In the English historical develop\u00ad ment. Of Course, in this country, the state courts represents a much more firmly established and deeply entrenched system than did the local courts in England. Moreover, the federal-state division of authority is much more sharply etched in our system than was the national-local authority in England. 377 Returning now to the contemporary scene in the United States, I have not yet mentioned the most radical and novel development of all. This is the rise of federal funding for the state judiciaries. There was, of course, no federal funding whatsoever for state courts at the beginning of the American Union or for the next century and three quarters. The first significant step in this direction came with the creation of the Law Enforcement Assistance Admin\u00ad istration in 1968. This federal agency was created to assist the states in what was intended to be a massive war on crime. Funds were to,be provided to bolster the criminnl justice capabilities of the states. While no one previously had specifically considered the courts to be part of the criminal justice sys\u00ad tem, they quickly came to be so perceived. LEAA money began to be chan\u00ad neled to the state courts, directly and indirectly. At first a trickle, it has grown to sizable sums. Grants to state courts in 19C0 from LEAA amounted to $2.5 million; in 1970 the annual figure was $140 million. To date a total of $715 million lias been channeled through LEAA to the state judiciaries. Such fi\u00ad nancing is openly advocated. Stote judges are appearing before Congressional committees urging federal funding for the state courts. Indeed, the prospect of any diminution in the present level of funding is viewed with dismay by judges and court administrators in many states. Strenuous lobbying and public relation efforts are mounted to ensure that federal funding continues to flow and to increase. Along with this, of course, goes the demand for safeguards around the independence of the state judiciaries. On this federal funding question, there has seldom been ia more dramatic turnabout. It was only a few years ago that many voices could be heard resisting any federal money for the state judiciaries. Faced with stringent state budgets, however, the lure of the federal dollar has become irrestible. The National Center for State Courts has also provided a focal point for federal funding and attention. Since its creation the Center has been largely funded by federal grants from LEAA. And today many people are urging that the Center and its activities be funded by a direct appropriation from Con\u00ad gress. The Attorney General has endorsed this idela, and it is not far-fetched to believe that such arrangements may come about. With direct federal fund\u00ad ing going to the State Court Center, it is not a great additional step to con\u00ad template federal funding going directly and expressly to the state courts themselves, rather than indirectly through LEAA. Indeed, this is being urged now. Unquestionably, federal appropriations are serving to bring the state and federal court systems together in new ways. The federal government is in\u00ad vesting over $30 million a year through LEAA in justice research directed primarily at matters of state concern. There is wide agreement that federal funding for justice research should continue, but that it should be broadened to Include civil as well as criminal justice matters, state and federal. The newly created Federal Justice Research Fund Is a move in that direction. That Fund, administered by the Department of Justice, is to be used to support research in all aspects of the justice system, wtihout the LEAA-type of restrictions. Con\u00ad sideration is being giving to creating a new federal structure to administer justice research funds. Whether such a structure would be modeled on the National Institute of Justice, as recommended by the American Bar Association or be contained within the Department of Justice or elsewhere, is as yet undecided. Federal funds to improve and support state courts are increasingly viewed as a necessity because state courts are chronically underfinanced by their own legislatures. In a recent letter to the Attorney General, commenting on the pro\u00ad posed restructuring of LEAA, the National Center for State Courts endorsed the position of the Conference of Chief Justices, that federal funding should con\u00ad tinue for The National College of the State Judiciary, for the National Center for State Courts and for the state judiciaries themselves. In encouraging such funding the Center and the Conference offer warnings and admonitions that federal money must, be supplied to the state courts with few or no strings be\u00ad cause of the nature of Ihc recipient Institutions. The Conference says, for ex\u00ad ample, \"there is a proper federal role in improving the Justice system but it must l>e performed In a manner that respects the identity and independence of state courts.\" While those are laudihle sentiments, similar admonitions have preceded federal funding in other areas of American life. But. Inevitably, federal regulation tends to follow federal money at least where the money flows in sul>-378 stantlal amounts over a period of time. The bureaucratic grip of the federal government, through HEW, on the colleges and the universities of this country rests entirely upon the flow of federal money to those institutions, sometimes in relatively small amounts to each. It is not clear that the state courts will be in any stronger position to resist the federal power that follows federal money than the institutions of higher education which, like the state courts, make legitimate and historically well-grounded claims to independence. Only a modest imagination is needed to foresee the development of federal standards for state courts In order for them to be eligible for federal appropria\u00ad tions. And, of course, once such standards are promulgated, some arrangements must be provided to determine whether they have been met. While this need not in theory Impair the independence of state judicial decisions, the appearance of such impairment will be unavoidable. Any similar kind of overseeing of the federal courts by Congress or the Executive would almost certainly be thought unconstitutional. It would be strange indeed for the state judiciaries to be sub\u00ad ject to greater federal authority than are the federal courts. Yet that prospect is not far-fetched and may indeed already be happening under present funding arrangements. The federal Executive Branch has in fact entered the picture in a new and potentially significant way. AVe have a new Attorney General who has espoused the view that the Department of Justice should increasingly exercise a national leadership role in justice at all levels. He has advocated that the Department take the initiative in creating a \"national policy on justice\" by bringing to\u00ad gether local, state and federal groups to collaborate and develop policies to im\u00ad prove the quality of justice and the courts at all levels. To promote this view, since taking office in January 1977, he has met with groups of state Chief Justices, Governors, state attorneys general, representatives of the National Center for State Courts, and others concerned with justice at the state and local levels. He has established a new office within the Justice Department called the Office for Improvements in the Administration of Justice to develop proposals which will affect state as well as federal courts. For example, this Office, with LEAA funding, is establishing experimental Neighborhood Justice Centers in three cities with the announced objective of establishing more if these are successful. The disputes which will come to tliese Centers would otherwise go to state tribunals if they went to court at all. Thus, the Department of Justice seems to be assuming something of the role of a ministry of justice with nationwide, rather than strictly federal, concerns. There Is no doubt at all that we have reached a point now where a jurisdic\u00ad tional and financial interrelationship exists between the state and federal coiirts and between the state courts and the federal government that was unknown and uncontemplated a century ago. This situation and its, implications for the future require that we rethink the structure of the entire American judiciary. It is possible that the combined effect of all the developments noted here will lead us along the route of the English experience. A plausible argument can be made that the trends point toward the emergence of a unitary, national system of courts. The growth of federal judicial power, the increasing uniformity In legal rules, the blending of functions, and the necessity of federal funding for state courts all could be read to suggest that eventuality. Yet there are substantial practical and Con\u00ad stitutional reasons for believing that that will not happen and that, instead, some other arrangement will emerge. One possibility would be a quasi-merger of the federal judiciary with the state court systems. Machinery could be developed within the federal judicial branch to administer federal monetary support for the state courts and to integrate those courts more closely with the federal system. This might be done in ways which would not threaten the independence of the state courts, as would federal executive or legislative supervision, but yet would bring about a smoother mesh\u00ad ing of the judiciary nationwide. For example, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, which already administers Congressional appropriations for the federal judiciary, could also serve to administer Congressional appropriations for the state judiciaries. Another possibility, apart from funding considerations, lies in the reallocation of judicial business between the systems. Duplicating and overlapping jurisdic\u00ad tions could be substantially reduced, and the federal appellate structure could be rearranged so as to integrate state and federal business in a more efficient 379 way. The pending reduction or abolition of diversity jurisdiction Is a move in that direction. Another idea along this line is the routing of all state criminal cases, which contain federal Issues, to the U.S. Courts of Appeals, thereby bypassing federal trial court review. Still other ideas may be gleaned from the Judicial \"organizations of other federallsms. In Australia and Canada, for example, all state court decisions are reviewable by a federal tribunal which is empowered to decide, with binding force, nil legnl questions, state mid federal. In the Federal Republic of Germany, there are no federal trial courts at all; the same, with rare exceptions, is true in Australia. The courts of first instance in both countries are provided by the states, and cases flow into a federal forum only at the appellate level. While these arrangements In other countries may be suggestive, it is unlikely that any one of them furnishes an exact model which would be feasible in the United States. We have our own long-standing Constitutional arrangements and legal habits and customs which are likely to lead us to a uniquely American scheme. The one thing that does seem clear from the conditions described here is that we are in n time of transition. I think it is important for all of us to recognize thnt. Actions taken or not taken over the next few years will definitely have an impact on the eventual design of the judicial processes in our country. We can, by steps we take or positions we advocate, either have a hand in shaping the direc\u00ad tion of events, or events will control us. It seems preferable to me to try to address our situation rationally, and make an effort to design structures best suited to our society and to the conditions of the late 20th century. Otherwise, we will simply drift Into new arrangements which may or may not be desirable. There are serious values and interests which must be accommodated in any American solution. There are, for example, values in decentralization; but there are also values to be served by a more efficient integration nationwide of our judi\u00ad cial systems. Above all, there is the enormous value to our society of the unique role of the judges, state and federal. Whatever we do, through all the restructur\u00ad ing, reorganizing, financing and streamlining, we must not impair that essential role: the deciding of controversies under law. The courts must be the place where citizens can go to have their disputes with each other or with the ever more intru\u00ad sive other branches of the government decided by detached, disinterested judges, applying evenhandedly the laws and principles that govern us all. All other func\u00ad tions of government can be performed by other agencies. As trial judges in the state courts, yon arc In the front line of the legal system. You are In an excellent position to contribute ideas to the development of new structural nnd procedural arrangements. The National College of the State Judi\u00ad ciary can also play an important part in this development. If the best minds of the legal order can be put on this problem, we may emerge from this time of transition Into a far better judicial system than we have yet had. 380 APPENDIX IV FURTHER LEGISLATIVE MATERIALS I )8TH CONGRESS f T D A -f A P? 1ST SESSION J\"J fC fcX I ^L^ To aid State and local governments in strengthening and improving their judicial systems through the creation of a State Justice Institute.

H4465 l INTRODUCTION OP THE STATE JUSTICE INSTITUTE ACT OP 1883 The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen\u00ad tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. KASTHI- HZTER) Is recognized [or 10 minutes. \u00ab Mr. KASTENMEIER. Mr. Speaker, today in a continuing effort to Im\u00ad prove the administration of Justice to this country, in State as well as Feder\u00ad al courts. I rise to reintroduce the State Justice Institute Act of 1983. It is with a certain amount of regret that I observe that a State Justice In\u00ad stitute has not already been enacted Into lav. Passed without dissent by the Senate during the 96th and 97th Congresses and also reported favor\u00ad ably by my subcommittee\u2014the House judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, CivO Liberties, and the Administration of Justice\u2014during these two Congress\u00ad es, final enactment has eluded this de\u00ad serving legislative project. I optimisti\u00ad cally look forward to legislative suc\u00ad cess in the 98th Congress. The Sta\u00a3e Justice Institute Act would create a nonprofit national body to improve the administration and functioning of State courts In the . United States. The act would provide to State and local courts a resource comparable to that provided In the correctional area by the National In\u00ad stitute of Corrections. It would be funded at a similar level and would provide a comparable spectrum.of na\u00ad tional clearinghouse research, techni\u00ad cal assistance, demonstration, and training programs. Pederal moneys could not be used to interfere with the independent nature of any State judi\u00ad cial system nor allow sums to be used for the funding of regular Judicial and administrative activities. The institute would complement. rather than conflict with, existing Pederal programs for State and local justice systems. It also would fill a gap in the President's program to fortify federalism by strengthening the Judi\u00ad cial power of the States. Last, the tn- stltute would provide meaningful access to Justice\u2014by improving the quality of Justice\u2014for many ordinary citizens who litigate their disputes in State and local courts. At summarized in recent ccngres- donal tfirtr\"\u00ab\">y by two able repre\u00ad sentatives of the State court systems: The State Justice Institute legislation b premised on the belief that improvement In the quality of Justice administered by the Rata boot only a goal of fundamental bn- porunce tn ttaell. but to objectivea tn- rtiri^t a reduced rat* of growta to the case\u00ad load of the federal couna and preservation at the historic role of state Judiciaries in oar federali The proposed legislation was drafted by an able task force of the Confer\u00ad ence of Chief Justices and the Confer\u00ad ence of State Court Administrators. It has been endorsed by, among others. | the Chief Justice of the United States, the Judicial Conference of the United States, and the American Bar Associ\u00ad ation. The chief sponsor of companion legislation (a 384) in the Senate, Sen\u00ad ator HOWELL HXTLUT, has been 'joined by a solid core of respected cosponsors from both aides of the aisle. The list of cosponsors an my bQl is equally ta\u00ad in my opinion, the State Justice In\u00ad stitute will succeed as an assistance program because it will: Place responsibility for improvement of State court systems directly on the Judicial officials charged with this re\u00ad sponsibility under their own State con\u00ad stitutions and laws; Be under control, at both the State and National levels, of State officials with first-hand knowledge of the prob\u00ad lems facing their courts; Permit large economies of scale by concentrating on national programs that would serve the needs of all 50 States;. Eliminate the need for a large bu\u00ad reaucracy by operating with a small staff in conjunction with resting judi\u00ad cial agencies of the States and the State courts themselves. (The Insti\u00ad tute could support but not duplicate services of existing agencies such as the National Center for State Courts and the National Judicial College): Permit Improvement of courts on a systemwlde basis: that is. In a manner recognizing their Interrelated civil and criminal functions; Provide a vehicle by which State courts coDeeUvely could communicate and cooperate at the national level with other components of State and local criminal Justice systems and such agencies as the Federal Judicial Center, the National Institute of Jus\u00ad tice, and the Bureau of Justice Statis\u00ad tics; and Provide a vehicle for Implementation of special criminal Justice projects au- H 446.6 thorized by Congress or Federal execu- . tive agencies as these.might Involve State courts. . The structure of the State Justice Institute would be as follows. The ln- - stitute would be operated by an execu\u00ad tive director under the supervision of an 11-member board 'of directors ap\u00ad pointed by the President and con\u00ad firmed by the Senate. Six board mem\u00ad bers would be State Judges and one a court administrator chosen from a panel or panels of candidates recom\u00ad mended by the Conference of Chief Justices following consultation with appropriate legal and .-Judicial organ!-' rations. There would be four public . members appointed directly by the President. The Institute would operate through grants and contracts with .funding priority going to projects of State and local courts and their na\u00ad tional nonprofit support and training organizations. State supreme, courts would be the accountable administra\u00ad tive agencies for projects of State and local courts within their Jurisdictions. Such projects would require a 25-per- \" cent match, The emphasis would be on programs of national scope Including national clearinghouse, research, tech\u00ad nical assistance, demonstration, educa\u00ad tion and training programs. The 'legislation specifically forbids use of Pederal funds to supplant State or local funds or to support basic court services. The Institute further Is restricted from Interfering with \"the Independ\u00ad ent nature of any State Judicial system.\" The proposed legislation authorizes modest funding at up to $20 million tn fiscal 1984 and $25 million In fiscal 1985 and 1986. Mr. Speaker. I would like to quote from the Chief Justice of the United States\u2014a man who has spent a life\u00ad time trying to improve the administra\u00ad tion of Justice In State and Federal courts; There Is ... clearly an overriding Mtf\"1*1 Interest in Improving access to and confi\u00ad dence In our state court. Important as it bt, our concept of federalism is not the only ob\u00ad jective requiring their preservation. Oar state courts are close to the people and they are the primary safeguard of the rights and privileges of Individuals under both state and federal law. Together with our federal courts, they preserve and vindicate those rights guaranteed under the Constitution and federal lava. In recent years, national legislative policies and programs have in\u00ad creased the number of such federal rights' adjudicated fn state courts. The role oar I state courts play In evaluating and arbitral-1 big the enforcement .of state policies, and' the state enforcement of national legislative policies and programs, is most sjgruf leant Chief Justice Burger's words are echoed by law professors. Judicial ad\u00ad ministrators, civn libertarians, Federal and State Judges, and ordinary citizens themselves. Indisputably, the Federal Judicial system was created to comple\u00ad ment our State Judicial systems. That complementary relationship creates the reslliant fabric of our constitution\u00ad al concepts of federalism and separa\u00ad tion of powers. The bQl I am Introduc\u00ad ing today\" strengthens,- rather than soils, that fabric. It will lead to im\u00ad provements in the delivery of Justice for Individuals who litigate In our State courts\u2014where 9$ percent of the cases In this country are filed. Once again. I would like to acknowl\u00ad edge the strong leadership of the prin\u00ad cipal sponsor of this legislation in the Senate. Senator HOWELL HOIDI, for\u00ad merly Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, has been firm and steadfast in his support for the cre\u00ad ation of a State Justice Institute. ; I \u00abi\u00abft would 1ft\u00bb to thank several State court Judges who have devoted much time and effort to this legisla\u00ad tive endeavor Justice Robert P. Utter, Supreme Court of Washington: Chief Judge Lawrence Cooke of the State of New York; and Chief Justice Bruce Bellfuss. Supreme Court of Wisconsin. The latter, my own chief Justice, Is re\u00ad tiring next month and I Just wanted my colleagues to know of his lifetime of commitment to Improving the deliv\u00ad ery of Justice In not only my home State but nationwide. In closing, the creation of a State justice Institute will assist all 50 State court systems and the territories to better serve all the people tn this country- I urge support and more co- sponsorship\u2014in addition to the 41 col\u00ad leagues already on the bill\u2014for this deserving legtslaUonT As a final postscript, I would like to announce that my subcommittee will hold'one day of hearings on the pro\u00ad posed legislation. On Thursday, July 13. 1983. at 10 am, the subcommittee wni receive \"testimony from repre\u00ad sentatives of the American Bar Associ\u00ad ation, the Conference of (State) Chief Justices, and the Judicial Conference of the United States.* O "}
