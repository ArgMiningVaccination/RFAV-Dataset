It is about learning, understanding and taking care of your body to improve your quality of life.' We Strive to educate our patients about Chiropractic and other natural solutions to common health problems in order to motivate you to take a more active and responsible role in restoring and maintaining your own health, as well as the health of your family and friends. \"True health is not a destination, rather it is a manner of traveling\" We understand that although our patients may be diagnosed with the same condition, they often respond very differently to treatments, some need very little care, while others need a more intensive and longer plan of care. For this reason, we tailor a specific plan of action to meet your needs, goals & unique medical and physical condition. Finding a chiropractor who understands changing health care needs and the most current techniques and approaches to addressing health problems can be a daunting task. Dr. VanBuskirk has been serving the community for 29 years. We hope that you will find this site helpful in learning more about chiropractic care as well as the ways that it can improve the quality of your life. "}
