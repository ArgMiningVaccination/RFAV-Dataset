The idea of holistic health is not a new one and homeopathy has been successfully practised for over two hundred years. People are really starting to consider alternatives to the main stream approach to treating sickness and they are also recognising the importance of taking steps towards being healthier. One big advantage of homeopathy is that you don't have to wait to get sick to have treatment, usually you can start improving your health with homeopathic treatment immediately. Each case is considered individually which entails a thorough consultation. The result of the treatment can mean that one becomes resistant to certain sicknesses or if one succumbs the outcome is not so bad. Everyone is different and the homeopath will take good note of what makes you different from everyone else. Home: Quote Natural Homeopathy We are a group of homeopaths working together to promote the understanding and potential of this system of treatment. We hope that as a patient, a member of the public who's enquiring about a homeopathic approach to health, a practitioner or a student that you find something of interest here. Questions like, can I combine homeopathy and orthodox medicine? Or, why might it not be in my best interest to take a substance repeatedly whether it is prescribed by a homeopath or a doctor or bought over the counter? If the functioning of the human being is understood, then many questions are put into perspective and understood as a result. Home: Welcome bottom of page "}
