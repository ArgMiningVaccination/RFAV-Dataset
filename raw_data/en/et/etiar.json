On Ayurveda being the next big thing globally There are several reasons why we believe that just like [yoga](https://www.vogue.in/wellness/content/pilates-vs-yoga-which-of-the-two-workouts-is-best-for-you) was discovered by the globe, the science of Ayurveda will be the next trend on its way to global acceptance. Ayurvedic products are entirely in sync with the needs of today's customers and global beauty trends. They are effective, natural, clean, cruelty free and contain no toxic chemicals or metals. In fact, our way of looking at [Ayurveda](https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/all-for-ayurveda-the-best-beauty-and-wellness-products-for-your-routine) is the concept of beauty along with [wellness](https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/good-earths-anita-and-simran-lal-talk-to-vogue-about-wellness-ayurveda-and-their-legacy-of-self-care), one where we create a balance in external and internal health along with mental well-being. This is now being accepted worldwide in the new trend where we see the convergence of beauty and all-around health. On ingredient forward formulas Transparency and potency of ingredients are at the centre of our ethos. The product range is 95% to 100% natural and each product clearly mentions the percentage of natural ingredients sans any harmful chemicals or toxic metals. The pure Ayurvedic herbs in our formulas are actually very beneficial for [skin](https://www.vogue.in/beauty/gallery/14-very-surprising-reasons-for-your-dry-skin-and-what-to-do-about-it), [hair](https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/haircare-tips-ive-learned-from-hairstylists-you-probably-didnt-know) and body. On ethical sourcing and sustainability In the manufacturing process, ethical sourcing is an inherent part of the process. We make a conscious decision not to use any endangered herbs but use the appropriate substitutes as suggested in Ayurveda, which gives similar efficacy. Ayurveda's basic principles are that the individual's rhythm and lifestyle must focus on harmonious and inclusive living with nature and the environment. The goal of Ayurveda and [sustainability](https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/is-your-perfume-sustainable) have similar overlaps.
