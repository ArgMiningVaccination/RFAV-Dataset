Try these tips from BabyCenter parents. Keep in mind that some medicines should not be taken with certain foods, or with any food at all. Be sure to ask your child's doctor or your pharmacist before combining - or following up - your toddler's medication with a favorite treat. Make it more palatable \"I tried the flavors that pharmacists can add to liquid medicine, and they worked great with my youngest daughter. I get everything in her favorite flavor, watermelon, and it all goes down just the way it's supposed to.\" \u2014 Anonymous \"I've finally found the only way for my 2-year-old to take a liquid antibiotic, but it only works for the refrigerated chalky kinds. I tried hiding it in every product known to man, and he could always tell and refused to eat or drink for a week for fear I was poisoning him. Finally, I discovered vegetable juice smoothies in the juice aisle. They're very strong (yet delicious) and naturally thick like the medicine, so he has no idea it's in there.\" \u2014 Wendy \"My son wouldn't take his medicine because it was very chalky and yucky tasting (even to me), so I mixed it with a teaspoon of yogurt. I called the pharmacist first, and he said it was okay to do with that specific prescription. Goes down easy now!\" \u2014 Anonymous Make it more fun \"My husband and I pass the medicine spoon around and pretend to take a sip ourselves. It makes our 2-year-old want what we're having!\" \u2014 L. B. \"When my son was little, we had a game. He would hold his nose and take his medicine, and then I would try to figure out where the medicine went. He never failed to take his medicine this way.\" \u2014 Brenda \"We tell our daughter to 'think pink' (or red or whatever color the medicine is), and then she takes it with no problems. Whenever possible, we give it to her with a meal or snack, and she's been known to refuse the food until she gets the medicine!\" \u2014 Happy Mom \"I give my daughter an ice cube to suck on for a minute. This seems to numb her taste buds a bit. If it's really bad-tasting medicine, she can suck on the [ice cube](/baby/solids-finger-foods/when-can-my-baby-have-ice-cubes_1368480) between sips. It works like a charm. If you're worried about your little one choking, try a juice pop or an ice cube in a facecloth instead.\" \u2014 Sherry \"Whenever possible we give our son his medicine when he's in the tub. That way, if he does happen to spit it out or throw it up, he's a lot easier to clean up.\" \u2014 Kimberly \"I do this crazy medicine dance - similar to the 'Yay! You went potty!' dance. My 18-month-old loves it and takes her medicine just to see me dance around like a lunatic.\" \u2014 melimartin Try another form \"If your child won't take a particular medicine, ask the doctor for an alternative preparation, such as a suppository or a more or less concentrated dose.\" \u2014 Mollie \"We discovered the beauty of 'thin strips' (medication in the form of paper-thin strips that dissolve on the tongue). No more battles or puddles of liquid medicine on the floor.\" \u2014 Anonymous \"We've had to give our son (now almost 18 months) medicine twice daily since he was around 3 months. My best recommendation if it's liquid: Get a syringe and squirt it directly into the back of the mouth. It's quick, usually mess-free, and doesn't waste any medicine.\" \u2014 Anonymous \"When my daughter was 7 months old, she had to take antibiotics three times a day. She was all right until the last two doses: Those she threw up the second they touched her lips, and she's made herself vomit every liquid medicine since. (She was just done, and I can't blame her.) So, when she needed antibiotics recently, at 15 months, I asked for the chewable tablets, because the medicine came that way. My ped seemed surprised that my daughter could manage them, but she's been handling the chewable acetaminophen like a pro for months, so I knew it was fine. The tablets smelled like ripe strawberries, and were apparently flavored pretty well. My daughter loved them, and we never had a speck of trouble getting them down.\" \u2014flippet \"My 6-month-old daughter just hated taking medicine, so when she ran a terrible fever the ER nurse recommended acetaminophen suppositories. They're a lot more expensive - about a dollar per dose - but they work in about 15 minutes, and I'm so glad to be done with the awful routine of wrestling with her, squirting the syrup down her throat, watching it all come back out seconds later, estimating how much more to safely give her, and then dealing with the pink dye all over her clothes and bedding!\" \u2014dizzyLizzy Be creative \"My 21-month-old had pink-eye, and I could never get the drops near his eyes. Then my great-grandmother suggested giving them to him while he's sleeping, and it worked! When he was in a deep sleep, I'd gently lift his eyelid and put in the drops. He'd rub his eyes for a few seconds and then go right back to sleep. Genius!\" \u2014 big b's mom Do what works \"As a pediatrician, I've found that different meds require different techniques. Having the pharmacist add flavors works well for some meds (ask your pharmacist). Alternative forms (like dissolving tabs) are available for some meds. Chocolate syrup (the kind meant to mix with milk, but used without the milk) covers up the taste of almost anything. Pharmacies and baby stores also sell a lot of products to help. Most important, make sure your child takes the medicine and at the right time! It's terrible to have to stick a kid with a needle or even hospitalize him because he didn't get the meds he could have taken by mouth at home.\" \u2014 Anonymous Was this article helpful? Yes No "}
