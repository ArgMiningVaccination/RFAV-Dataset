With the advent of data-intensive science, a full integration of big data science and health care will bring a cross-field revolution to the medical community in China. The concept We aimed to develop and implement a big data platform for a large hospital, to overcome difficulties in integrating, calculating, storing, and governing multisource heterogeneous data in a standardized way, as well as to ensure health care data security. The project to build a big data platform at West China Hospital of Sichuan University was launched in 2017. The West China Hospital of Sichuan University big data platform has extracted, integrated, and governed data from different departments and sections of the hospital since January 2008. A master-slave mode was implemented to realize the real-time integration of multisource heterogeneous massive data, and an environment that separates heterogeneous characteristic data storage and calculation processes was built. A business-based metadata model was improved for data quality control, and a standardized health care data governance system and scientific closed-loop data security ecology were established. After 3 years of design, development, and testing, the West China Hospital of Sichuan University big data platform was formally brought online in November 2020. It has formed a massive multidimensional data resource database, with more than 12.49 million patients, 75.67 million visits, and 8475 data variables. Along with hospital operations data, newly generated data are entered into the platform in real time. Since its launch, the platform has supported more than 20 major projects and provided data service, storage, and computing power support to many scientific teams, facilitating a shift in the data support model\u2014from conventional manual extraction to self-service retrieval (which has reached 8561 retrievals per month). The platform can combine operation systems data from all departments and sections in a hospital to form a massive high-dimensional high-quality health care database that allows electronic medical records to be used effectively and taps into the value of data to fully support clinical services, scientific research, and operations management. The West China Hospital of Sichuan University big data platform can successfully generate multisource heterogeneous data storage and computing power. By effectively governing massive multidimensional data gathered from multiple sources, the West China Hospital of Sichuan University big data platform provides highly available data assets and thus has a high application value in the health care field. The West China Hospital of Sichuan University big data platform facilitates simpler and more efficient utilization of electronic medical record data for real-world research. Emerging technologies, such as big data, the Internet of Things, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence, are profoundly changing medical and health care service models. Health and medical data sets, which are typically large with rapid growth, diverse data structure, multidimensional value density, high requirements of data credibility, and high concerns over data security, are often called health care big data. The term Driven by national policies, high-income countries in Europe, such as the United Kingdom [ In addition to national-level big data platforms in health care that are driven by policies, large health care institutions have also built big data platforms to suit their own management needs. At present, a medium-sized health care institution in China generates 1 to 20 TB of health care data, and a large health care institution generates 300 TB to 1 PB of health care data every year. Some hospitals have used big data technology to build hospital-level scientific research platforms\u2014for example, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School in the United Kingdom developed a research data management platform [ Meta-analyses [ Health care data generated in large hospitals include (1) electronic medical records of clinical diagnosis and treatment, which contain diagnoses, prescriptions, surgical treatments, and examination findings; (2) data derived from health management or clinical research activities, including follow-up information, gene sequencing data, and physical examination data; (3) data related to hospital management, including patient wait times, bed turnover rate, medical equipment utilization efficiency, and revenue; and (4) data derived from web-based diagnosis and treatment services [ In addition to the technical considerations for platform construction, data management in large hospitals must take into account by data service management. Special attention should be paid to patient privacy protection and ethical concerns on data use. A hospital data platform is generally built for a specific purpose, such as scientific research, operations, data integration, or analysis, but large hospitals often require a comprehensive data platform\u2014one that meets needs for medical treatment, education, scientific research, and management. The overall objective of this study was to develop and implement a health care big data platform for a large hospital in China, with data governance as the core concept, to solve difficulties related to integration, calculation, storage, standardization, and security for multisource heterogeneous medical data. This platform will integrate the data from all operation systems in a hospital to generate high-quality data assets and form a massive high-dimensional medical database that can comprehensively support the clinical activities, scientific research, and management of the hospital. From a technical aspect, construction of a big data platform needs to solve the following problems that are unique to the health care industry: (1) integration of multisource heterogeneous data from multiple independent information systems within the hospital; (2) computing power requirements brought by the development of machine learning and deep learning during data application; (3) difficulties in analyzing and utilizing information data (due to nonuniform data standards, inconsistent use of a master patient index, and the fact that most electronic medical records in China are written in natural language, it is impossible to directly analyze and use existing information data, and as a result, semantic interoperability must be improved with the use of medical terminology) and (4) data security and patient privacy protection. The West China Hospital of Sichuan University (WCH) built a health care big data platform, which is referred to as the WCH-BDP or Traditional information technology can no longer handle massive amounts of data that are continuously growing, causing difficulties in effectively integrating multisource heterogeneous data, the serious problem of isolated data islands, bottlenecks in data storage and calculation, difficulties in structurally utilizing medical records written in Chinese semantics, and high technical barriers in mining data from images, videos, and files. In 2017, WCH launched a hospital-wide health care big data platform project to address these difficulties. The project focuses on the design and development of the platform architecture and does not involve any study of clinical data, so ethical declarations are not applicable. The first step of platform construction was organizing a project management team. To ensure the performance of the platform, WCH set up 2 working groups\u2014one for platform construction, and the other for platform management. The construction working group included the chief platform architect, information technology experts, system engineers, and data engineers. The hospital information center was responsible for building the platform. The construction working group focused on the following: (1) the application objectives of the platform, (2) data integration method and scope, (3) master patient index strategy, (4) reference standards for medical terms, (5) scope of the master data, (6) data model structure, and (7) system implementation and training. Project meetings were held weekly and status meetings were held monthly to summarize the progress of the phases until the platform was launched. The discussions in these meetings provided a solid foundation for platform design and development. After the launch of the platform, the construction working group also conducted regular training on system functions, maintenance, and the help manual. The management working group included all stakeholders, such as the chief information officer, hospital management users, clinical users, and scientific research users. The management group was the data governance committee responsible for organizing and overseeing all data-related work, including data definitions, data benchmarking, data quality control, and data security, after the launch of the platform. The committee was in charge of formulating related management systems, work collaboration mechanisms, and procedure standardization. The convergence of multisource heterogeneous data from all operation systems in the hospital was necessary to ultimately provide data to different medical services ( Big data platform architecture. Massive data were collectively stored in the storage devices of the WCH-BDP. To better support data analysis, storage and calculation environments were designed and provided according to the characteristics of each data modality. Generally, the amount of data structuration is negatively correlated with storage space and computing power (ie, the greater the data structuration, the lower the requirements for storage space and computing power) ( Highly structured data do not require much storage space. They can be stored on a distributed storage device, and computations can be effectively run by conventional central processing units. Semistructured data, such as the records of a patient's major complaint, disease history, examination findings, and examination conclusions in Chinese electronic medical records do not occupy much storage space and can be stored in distributed storage devices. However, these data require natural language processing for analysis; therefore, both general graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units are needed to provide sufficient computing power. Unstructured data that are large in total volume but small in individual volume (eg, the original image data in DICOM format generated by thin-layer scanning examinations such as radiology and ultrasound) require a relatively high storage space and must be stored in centralized storage devices (mostly network-attached storage) to save resources. To analyze and mine these data, characteristic modeling is performed mainly with machine learning or deep learning technologies, which requires the support of a large amount of GPU power and private GPU resources. Unstructured data with a large individual volume, such as genomic data, are generally stored directly in object-based storage. Genomic sequencing generates not only a large amount of original sequencing data, but also, a large amount of data related to multiple processes in research on biological information. As a result, genomic data sets often have a tremendous size, and the storage space that is required is mostly measured in petabytes. Analysis and mining of the types of data stored in object-based storage require a lot of clustered computing power supplied by multiple high-performance GPUs, which necessitates the deployment of accelerated supercomputing power supported by GPU clusters. Traditional big data platforms are planned and implemented in a unified way with storage and computing integration. The design of the WCH-BDP is the realization of storage and computation separation. The WCH-BDP first solves the problem of effective storage and management of massive genomic data files. Second, when researchers use genetic data for analysis, the scheduling software provided by the WCH-BDP loads the analysis data into the supercomputer environment for analysis. After the analysis is completed, the analysis results are retained, and the temporary storage space occupied by the analysis process is released. The relationship between the degree of data structuration and storage and computing capability. In China, medical institution operations information database systems mainly include Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle database, MySQL database, Cach\u00e9 database, and MongoDB; other unstructured data are mostly stored in the form of files. The WCH-BDP achieves data integration through both real-time and non-real-time data entries. For real-time data integration, a master-slave database is generated, and the log data of the slave database are parsed and captured in real time. Real-time data integration is suitable for an operations information system with mostly structured data. Parsing the information in the slave database does not consume much physical resources and therefore does not affect the performance of the master database, which ensures the security and stability of data integration. Image data integration and entry can be completed by directly reading image files using the DICOM protocol. Genomic data and other data in the form of files are not integrated in real time and are entered via file transfer protocol. The enterprise master patient index is the unique tag of a patient in a health care institution. One patient might have different enterprise master patient indexes in the different operating systems of a hospital because these systems were constructed independently. This necessitated a master patient index governance to standardize the enterprise master patient indexes. The governance of the master index data is achieved through the master index governance system. The governance system included 4 stages: data preparation, standardization strategy, data processing, and tracking or feedback ( The data governance strategy of the WCH-BDP mainly focused on 3 key values: ID number, name, and telephone number. The configurations and data processing of these 3 key values are shown in the following table ( Master index data processing cannot rely only on the system for automatic completion. For example, in the fifth row of Flowchart of master index governance. Governance strategy of enterprise master patient include all related data items listed in the data dictionary, such as health care institution code, drug code, diagnosis code, and anesthesia method [ Example of the WCH-BDP master data reference standard. |Classification of master data||Number of | |Basic industry information||6||GB 11714-1997 coding representation informatics||20||GB/ | |Personal information||12||GB/ | |Information technology||3||GB/ | Metadata are the bridge between the data and the data users. They describe the content (what), coverage (where, when), quality, management method, owner (who), and provision method (how) of data. The metadata governance approach used by the WCH-BDP is shown in In the WCH-BDP, a unified metadata model for identifying the registered original data was designed and constructed based on the standards of the Common Warehouse Metamodel of the Object Management Group. Based on the metadata directory, the relationship for data mapping is configured to initiate data extraction. The mapping results are saved in terms of the configured relationship and compared with the standard terminology and tags in the metadata management system. All extracted data are stored in the platform's data repository, which provides data services to the application layer using standardized metadata, terminology, and tags. Metadata governance architecture. Terminology standardization is an important step in metadata governance. The WCH-BDP uses medical terminology from the Chinese Open Medical and Healthcare Alliance to standardize the terminology in the metadata system. Tagging is also one of the more effective methods used for data governance. Unlike terminology synonyms, the Many medical records and reports with descriptions written in Chinese are difficult to process due to the unique characteristics of the Chinese language. Currently, in China, one mainstream post-structured data processing method is the use of machine learning technology combined with health care terminology to segment words and refine concepts from Chinese text [ Data utilization and security are contradictory. To ensure proper and secure data use, all countries have issued laws and regulations on the security of health and medical data. Referring to relevant international and domestic laws and regulations on security protection, the WCH-BDP uses a Data security refers to data classification and hierarchical management security. Scholars from Harvard University have proposed that a data classification system should be established to ensure data security according to the laws and regulations of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and related ethical regulations on scientific research [ Data security strategy of the big data platform. |Security classification||Security level||Descriptions||Examples||Precautions| |Level 1||Most confidential||Hypersensitive information||Financial data, personal authentication for a specified single individual to use| |Level 2||Confidential||Highly sensitive information||Credit data, personal health privacy data||A specified environment for a specified single role to use| |Level 3||Secret||General sensitive information||Personal information during diagnosis and treatment, contract information, employee management data of employees||Use after the role group is authorized| |Level 4||Internal use only||Information that is not publicly disclosed||Organizational structure, basic information of employees, general data after desensitization||Use after internal authorization| |Level 5||Open to the public||Data that can be publicly disclosed||Summarized results obtained by statistical analysis||Public access or use| App security refers to the data app security management of a system during its processes. In the WCH-BDP, a unified master data authentication service is provided for user authentication so that each app system manages only role and app permissions required by the system itself. When an actual role user uses an app, data desensitization and encryption are completed through the unified platform service interface to ensure the security of the data app. Use security refers to the security management during the processes of data processing, use, and analysis. The National Institutes of Health has emphasized that special attention should be paid to privacy protection in data apps [ Multiparty computation is a controllable and measurable method proposed by a Turing Award winner, Qizhi Yao, to solve the problem of data abuse [ Data desensitization and encryption policies of big data platform. |Name of involved||Design |Digital rounding or percentage method| |Structured data of fixed length||Identification card number, telephone number, name...||Replace or encrypt from the starting bit to the end of the specified length range| |Text data of varying length||Address, electronic medical record, descriptive diagnosis (infectious disease)||Locating sensitive content, then replace or encrypt sensitive characters| |Image ultrasonic and pathological is configured| |File data||Genomics, molecular protein data||Locating sensitive content and rename sensitive characters| Management security of platform data requires that all platform services, including data services, be completed under secure closed-loop management. In the WCH-BDP, all tasks\u2014data access, management, and governance; data analysis, utilization, and mining; and the transformation and realization of scientific research findings\u2014are completed through platform services for data resources, storage, computing power, and network access. Establishment of the management security system can effectively guarantee the security of the data utilization process. Currently, most research findings are obtained in a laboratory or scientific research setting but are difficult to apply in an actual production setting, which directly leads to a low transformation rate of research achievements and insufficient recognition of intellectual property rights. In the WCH-BDP, through the integrated service gateway that connects to the real service operation scenario, published research findings can be directly introduced into clinical practice, realizing the translation of scientific research to the clinic. In this process, the design of the integrated service gateway management system can effectively ensure researcher's ownership security. Data quality management is a continuous process and an important link in data governance. Health care data quality management in the WCH-BDP involves the following steps: (1) building a data quality standard system; (2) evaluating current data quality; (3) analyzing data quality problems; (4) developing and optimizing the solutions in detail to solve problems; and (5) establishing a data quality control knowledge database for future reference. The steps above are continuously iterated to form a closed-loop system for health care data quality management. Common data quality problems include data outliers, duplications, data without any clear relationships, orphaned data records, and data that make no logical sense medically. Fully referring to the evaluation and grading standards of electronic medical records issued by the National Health Commission of China and research findings by experts in the field of health care [ Data quality standard system. |Dimension||Content of the dimension||Quality indicator||Rule| |Consistency||Check whether the data value is in the dictionary domain||Consistency rate||Higher than 90%| |Integrality||Check the completeness of the required data||Percentage of integrality||Higher than 80%| |Relevance||Check the relationship between key data||Degree of fluctuation of data volume is abnormal||Fluctuation ratio||Lower than 20%| In addition to data quality control for original data, quality control management of procedures in operations are included [ The WCH-BDP is an environment that can effectively support data services with voluminous data repositories and strong physical resources for data computation and storage. Under an overall ecology of data security management, the platform can provide support to data services such as computing, storage, and virtualization. Search engine services, terminology services, and artificial intelligence services can be effectively integrated to meet the needs of all health care operations. The WCH-BDP was formally launched in November 2020, after 3 years of construction, for demand surveys, platform design, module development, and pilot operation. To date, the platform has formed a massive high-dimensional database with more than 12.49 million patients, 75.67 million visits, and 8475 data variables. The platform has brought hospital informatization to a new level and greatly improves the hospital's overall big data capabilities. The WCH-BDP has more than 20 PB data storage capacity and runs on a server cluster consisting of 252 physical servers: 117 servers are dedicated to computing and analyzing, and 38 are equipped with more than one GPU card. In the server cluster dedicated to computing, there are 320 CPU cores and 149 GPU cards. In total, the platform has computing powers that exceed 300 TFLOPS for clinic data, 600 TFLOPS for image data, and 1000 TFLOPS for genomic data. The WCH-BDP integrates diagnosis and treatment data from clinical information systems, clinical research data from science and research information systems, and management activity data from management information systems. Of 134 hospital systems, the platform has integrated the data of 27 systems, including hospital information systems, laboratory information systems, radiology, ultrasound, web-based medical appointments, human resources, equipment and supply management, Internet medical service since January 2008. In addition, all image data in the picture and communication systems and more than 20,000 patients' genomic data have been entered into the platform. Using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources Reference Information Model 3.0 standards, data integrated into the WCH-BDP were reorganized and arranged based on the type of operational activities while considering the characteristics of China's medical system. Finally, a database that includes 134 data charts for 18 subject fields was developed. The top 5 subject fields that were responsible for the most data in the database are listed in Top-5 subject fields in terms of number of technology||6||502||115073.35||Electrocardiogram system, radiology information system, echocardiography system, endoscopic system, dynamic electrocardiogram system, pathology information system, ultrasonic system, laboratory information system, interventional surgical workstation, medical technology reservation information system, outpatient information system, physical examination information system| |3||Fee||8||440||60855.24||Hospital information system, physical examination information system, online diagnosis and treatment system| |4||Medical advice||3||395||21366.64||Hospital information system, online diagnosis and treatment system| |5||Staff||13||802||18138.94||Hospital information system, physical examination information system, electronic data capture, human resource system| The platform has constructed a data asset directory for users by further standardizing the data through the governance of master data, metadata, terminology, and natural language processing. To ease the process of inquiry, the directory has a hierarchical tree structure that allows users to select the data items that they need using fuzzy searches. To minimize comprehension difficulties, the directory uses a data variable-naming scheme consistent with the names in the interface of the corresponding operations systems as much as possible; in addition, users can see the information of the data source, content, and range of values. The data asset directory covers 13 fields and 1488 data variables ( List of data assets. |Number||Directory field||Data variable (unit)||Types of variables||Example| |1||Demographic||91||Structured||Gender, age, occupation, present address, nationality, height, weight, blood type| |2||Basic medical information||410||Structured||Appointment date, visit date, clinic department, clinic type, supervising doctor, the department transferred to, admission date, discharge date, discharge state| |3||Medical record information||123||Unstructured||Admit note, progress note, discharge record| |4||Clinical diagnostic information||47||Structured||Clinic diagnosis, emergency diagnosis, admitting diagnosis, discharge diagnosis, medical insurance diagnosis, pathological diagnosis| |5||Surgical and operational information||138||Structured||Name of operation, name of procedure, surgeon, surgical grade, anesthesia grading, incision type, level of healing| |6||Diagnosis and treatment information||166||Structured||Type of medical order, drug name, usage, dosage, frequency, execution time of medical order| |7||Laboratory test data||147||Structured||White blood cell count, red blood cell count, sodium level, uric acid level, blood glucose level, creatinine level| |8||Imaging signs| |11||Scale evaluation data||50||Structured||Mood index, pressure assessment, risk assessment of falling out of bed| |12||Medical cost information||65||Structured||Name of charge items, amount of charge items, settlement time| |13||Patient label information||24||Unstructured||Patients with lower test results after surgery, patients with higher blood pressure after medication| Supported by the data services of the platform, the research teams of WCH have constructed more than 120 disease databases for different research aims, including a number of national-level multicenter disease databases. Since it was launched, the platform has supported more than 20 clinical and hospital management research projects, of which, 3 have won second prize in the State Science and Technology Progress Award of China and first and second prizes in the Sichuan Provincial Science and Technology Progress Award. The platform's support of basic research is exemplified by a project on the mechanisms of allosteric regulation and signal transduction of G protein-coupled receptors conducted by the State Key Laboratory of Sichuan University; using the storage and computing power provided by the WCH-BDP, the research team revealed the microconversions of key amino acids during allosteric regulation, which laid the foundation for the design and screening of G protein-coupled receptor-targeting small molecule allosteric regulators (unpublished, X. Yang, PhD, 2022). Another example of the platform's support of clinical research is a lung cancer research project at WCH. Using the data resources, storage resources, computing power, and exploration environment provided by the platform, the lung cancer research team identified and validated high-sensitivity high-specificity markers for early diagnosis of lung cancer [ Artificial intelligence-assisted products for lung nodule diagnosis can detect 3 mm to 5 mm pulmonary nodules with 98.8% accuracy through artificial intelligence technology, which was significantly better than the performance of domestic and foreign specialists (79.9% of doctors with senior experience in Peking Union Medical College, only 40.9% of those with junior experience), and the average reading of each chest computed tomography (CT) can save 3 to 5 minutes [ Using this platform, research on segmentation of adrenal glands from CT images [ The launch of the WCH-BDP has led to tremendous changes in the data service model of the hospital ( Changes between the traditional and the present data service. | ||Traditional data services||Data services base on the platform| |Data visualization||Data not visible||Users can visually view the available data catalog| |Data retrieval||Data engineers develop code through experience||Users can customize the search format and output format through the search engine and preview the results| |Data approval||Data are available after ethical review and clinical study program approval||Data are available after ethical review and clinical study program approval| |Data mining||Use your own computer to analyze data||Development environment and tools, such as R, SPSS, and Python, can be used on the platform, and computing power provided by the platform can be called by data mining algorithm| |Data download and access||Download the data which data engineers develop and perform encryption||The platform creates accounts with different permissions for registered users. In a network environment after security authentication, authorized users can log in to the big data platform unified portal through virtual desktop infrastructure. The platform provides each authorized user with private storage space of different capacities. Users can directly store their research results in this space, or install the software developed by our college on their personal computers to transfer the research results to personal computers| The launch of the WCH-BDP has substantially improved the capacity of data services ( The engineers completed 996 instances of manual data service in the 6 months before the launch of the platform (monthly mean 166). In contrast, 8561 self-service data retrievals were completed each month after the launch of the platform\u2014a 51-fold increase in service efficiency. Each person could complete 2 instances of data services each day before but could complete 65 instances per day after the launch of the platform due to the help offered by the automated search engine\u2014a 37-fold increase. In addition, the platform shortened the average duration of each data service 30-fold, from 4.5 hours to 0.15 hours. The platform substantially improved the volume and efficiency of data services. Comparison of data service capabilities. |Before the launch||After the launch| per request (hour)||4.5||0.15| Data security is a key focus of the platform. In the past, data security relied mostly on the professional ethics of data engineers. In contrast, in this platform, which automatically manages data and provides data services, data security management is mostly system-based and manually assisted because all operation activities leave footprints in the system. This can prevent the abuse of individual permissions and effectively ensure data security. The performance of the WCH-BDP has demonstrated that data resources can be effectively converged and governed to form highly usable data assets that have extremely high application value in the field. The success of the construction of a big data platform in health care is based on the following: (1) The project is managed with a strong organizational structure that has a top-down data governance committee involving multiple parties. The committee leads and oversees data governance duties. (2) The project is led by an information technology department that can provide technical support. The information technology team should have excellent skills and be familiar with the operations and data connotations of all systems in the hospital. (3) All departments and sections of the hospital should participate in the project, and detailed demand surveys and analyses should be performed. (4) The project requires sufficient scientific knowledge in medical informatics, management, and engineering to ensure smooth integration of medicine, management, and informatics for overall framework design. (5) The ethics office and clinical research management sections of the hospital should participate in the project to ensure patient privacy protection and data security. (6) The construction project needs suppliers who have rich experience and can provide sufficient technical support. (7) A sufficient amount of servers are needed for data storage and computation. (8) The project needs sufficient financial support. Similarities between the WCH-BDP and other data platforms [ The WCH-BDP can be further improved and optimized by (1) connecting more operations systems of the hospital to the platform and continuously optimizing the data governance strategies; (2) further utilizing and mining the data (eg, exploring multimodal artificial intelligence apps in health care); (3) making the platform a multicenter public platform by launching transdisciplinary, cross-hospital, cross-regional collaborations and including more medical information data; and (4) providing the hospital with further full-cycle computed tomography graphics processing unit West China Hospital of Sichuan University West China Hospital of Sichuan University big data platform This study was sponsored by the National Health Commission (Big data integration and application platform construction of West China Hospital of Sichuan University).
