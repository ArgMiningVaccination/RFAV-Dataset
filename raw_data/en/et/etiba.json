You want to keep your kiddos safe at daycare, school, on the playground, and when visiting friends and family. But what's the best way of doing that? In most cases, a [COVID-19 vaccine](/covid-19/vaccine-faqs/) is a big part of the answer. So, what do you need to know about the COVID-19 vaccine and who can get one? We share answers to some of the most common questions about COVID-19 vaccination for infants, kids and teens. What's the youngest age for a COVID-19 vaccination? The COVID-19 bivalent vaccine is available for children 6 months old and older. Is the COVID vaccine safe for kids? Yes. The vaccine is shown to be safe in children ages 6 months old and older. The COVID-19 vaccine works the same way in infants, kids and teenagers as it does in adults - there are no additional risks, extra hazards or unusual side effects. The vaccine was extensively tested before public health officials authorized its use. Children and teenagers responded to the vaccine in the same way adults did - with only temporary and mild side effects, or none at all. Is the COVID-19 vaccine for children different? No. Children receive the same vaccine as adults. But in some cases, the doses are different. Is the COVID-19 vaccine effective in kids and teens? Yes. The COVID-19 vaccine gives your child excellent protection against the coronavirus. Once vaccinated, an infant, kid or teenager has a much lower risk of developing COVID-19, with the greatest protection coming against severe illness, hospitalization and death. Is the COVID-19 vaccine effective against new variants? Yes. The bivalent vaccines, which were released in the fall of 2022, are especially effective at protecting people against new variants of COVID-19. The first vaccine released in December 2020 was a monovalent vaccine formulated with only the Wuhan strain of the coronavirus. The bivalent vaccines contain components of the Wuhan and Omicron strains. Because Omicron is now the most common strain, scientists believe the bivalent vaccine will reduce the number of people who get sick or have severe symptoms. It's recommended that all children get one or more doses of a bivalent vaccine, either as part of their initial vaccine or as an additional dose. Does it take any longer for infants, kids or teens to develop protection after getting a COVID-19 vaccine? No. Just like in adults, it takes about two weeks for a child's body to build up protection following a vaccine. But younger children may need multiple doses to get all the protection they need. So if a COVID-19 vaccine requires more than one dose, it's important for your child to get all recommended doses in order to be considered fully immunized. I've heard that children don't get as sick with COVID-19. Should children and teens still get the COVID-19 vaccine? It's true that most children don't get severe COVID-19 symptoms - but unfortunately, that's not always the case. Children have still been hospitalized and died because of their symptoms. It's also important to remember that your child's symptoms may not end when their COVID-19 infection goes away. After COVID-19, children can experience long-term symptoms that could last for weeks or months. We know that being vaccinated reduces the chance your child gets sick. And if they get [breakthrough COVID-19](https://www.healthpartners.com/blog/covid-19-breakrough-case-after-vaccination) after being vaccinated, they may be less likely to have lingering symptoms - [studies show](https://www.bmj.com/content/376/bmj.o407) that, in adults, the chance of getting long COVID is 50% lower if you're fully vaccinated. Also, keep in mind that your unvaccinated child can pose a risk to others, including people with weakened immune systems and the elderly. Even [a mild case of COVID-19](/blog/how-to-treat-mild-covid-19-at-home/) can spread, and if someone else gets it - like an immunocompromised grandparent - they may need [treatments to protect against severe COVID-19](https://www.healthpartners.com/blog/covid-19-treatments-to-prevent-severe-illness). COVID-19 vaccination schedule for children The number of vaccine doses your child needs depends on their age, health and the type of COVID-19 vaccine they get. Talk to your child's doctor about which of the following vaccines makes most sense for them. And if they've already received one or more vaccine doses, ask if they should get a dose of a bivalent vaccine. Pfizer bivalent vaccine for children 6 months and older The Pfizer vaccine is available for all children 6 months and older. Here's the dosing by age: - 6 months through 4 years old: Three doses of the bivalent vaccine. The first two doses are given 3-8 weeks apart, with the third given eight weeks later. - 5 years and up: One dose of the bivalent vaccine. Moderna bivalent vaccine for children 6 months old and older The Moderna vaccine is available for children 6 months and older. Children's dosing is as follows: - 6 months through 5 years old: Two doses, given one month apart. - 6 years and up: One dose of the bivalent vaccine. Novavax monovalent vaccine for children 12 and older Generally speaking, getting either the Pfizer or Moderna bivalent vaccine is recommended for both kids and adults. But the Novavax vaccine is an option for families who prefer a spike protein [type of COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.healthpartners.com/covid-19/vaccine-faqs/) instead of an mRNA vaccine. Dosing is as follows: - 12 through 17 years old: Two doses given 3-8 weeks apart. Additional doses for children who are immunocompromised The CDC recommends that some moderately to severely immunocompromised children receive [additional doses of the bivalent vaccine](https://www.healthpartners.com/blog/covid-19-vaccine-booster-shots-what-to-know/). Talk to your doctor to learn more. Why did COVID-19 vaccine authorization take longer for children? A child's body is not just a small version of an adult's body. There are lots of differences that go beyond height and weight. One of these differences is how the immune systems works. While an adult's immune system has been built up by exposure to pathogens over the years, a child's immune system is still maturing. So, while scientists knew how the COVID-19 vaccine worked with an adult's immune system, they couldn't be sure that a child's would respond to the vaccine in the same way. That's why we needed clinical studies to make sure the COVID-19 vaccines are safe for different age groups, provide a good level of protection and that the doses are the right size. Should I wait to vaccinate my child? No. The safety and effectiveness of the vaccine is well proven. The COVID-19 vaccine has been available for quite some time, providing incredible protection against COVID-19 in adults and children of all ages. That's why we strongly recommend that you get your child vaccinated as soon as they are eligible. While vaccine doses for younger children may be smaller, it's still the same proven vaccine that's been used in hundreds of millions of people. And, getting the vaccine provides the same level of protection for children as it does for adults. What are the COVID-19 vaccine side effects for infants, kids and teens? The side effects in children are the same as in adults: temporary, mild to moderate, and manageable with over-the-counter remedies. In a few cases, we've seen kids and teens feel side effects a bit more strongly than adults. But that's actually a good thing: Younger people tend to have more robust immune systems, so it's a sign the vaccine is creating a healthy response as it trains the body. What should I know about the COVID-19 vaccine and heart problems? You may have heard that some people had inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or inflammation of the sac around the heart (pericarditis) after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. The chance of this happening is extremely rare. In the U.S., people have received over 550 million COVID-19 vaccine doses and there are only a few thousand reported cases of myocarditis or pericarditis. While the chance of heart inflammation is low for everyone, it's more likely to occur in males between the ages of 12-39 years. In the rare event that inflammation happens after getting a COVID-19 vaccination, it's usually very mild and people make a full recovery. Health officials continue to recommend the COVID-19 vaccine for all children over the age of five because if your child gets infected with COVID-19, they are more likely to get heart inflammation than they would from the COVID-19 vaccine. To reduce the risk of heart inflammation from the COVID-19 vaccine, the guidelines from the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#safety-mRNA) now say that \"an 8-week interval may be optimal for people who are not immunocompromised and ages 12-64 years, especially for males ages 12-39 years.\" Does the COVID-19 vaccine cause infertility later in life? No. There's no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccine affects development or fertility. The vaccine doesn't change the body's DNA or functioning in any way. Instead, it teaches the body's immune system to recognize and fight the coronavirus in case it's ever encountered. How can kids and teens get a COVID-19 vaccine? It's easy to set up an appointment for your child or teenager: Patients under 18 years old, or their parent or guardian, can [schedule online](/care/appointments/whose-appointment) or [call a primary care clinic](/care/find/locations/primary-care/) Keep in mind that for patients younger than 18 years old, additional information about the patient's parent or guardian must be provided in order to schedule the appointment. Do I need to be with my child when they get a COVID-19 vaccine? Yes, a parent or guardian must attend vaccine appointments with their child. This is an important thing to remember (especially for teenagers who can drive themselves): Parental consent is required for anyone under 18 years old to be vaccinated. Can a COVID-19 vaccine be given at the same time as other shots? Yes. There's no waiting period between receiving a COVID-19 vaccine and receiving other vaccines. That means kids can get vaccinated on any schedule, or get multiple vaccinations at the same appointment. It's especially important that children keep up with their [doctor-recommended vaccination schedule](/blog/childhood-immunization-schedule-by-age/) while also getting protected against COVID-19. Keep your kids and our community safe Thanks to the COVID-19 vaccines and the safety precautions you and others have taken since 2020, life is feeling more normal again. But COVID-19 isn't over - it's still causing new infections and deaths each day. The good news is that most severe illnesses and deaths can be prevented by getting vaccinated. We all want our kids to do the things that make childhood fun and give them the opportunity to visit with friends and learn in a social setting. The COVID-19 vaccines can keep them safe and help prevent the spread of COVID-19 so our kids can keep doing the things they love. "}
