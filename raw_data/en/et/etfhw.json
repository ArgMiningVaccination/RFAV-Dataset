I learned much of what I know the hard way, I took a lot of antibiotics as a kid. I had ear infections and had to take big orange pills to get rid of them. For the rashes on my lips, I learned to carry around Neosporin. By the time I got to college, I started experiencing back pain. In graduate school, I noticed that taking pills made my infections go away but when stopped, soon the problems returned. While becoming a Chiropractor, I signed up for the a three year program in homeopathic medicine Homeopathy required learning to listen and wait, rather than look for quick fixes. I learned to be humble around the pain of illness and the success of healing. I grew comfortable with any form of illness and suffering. My own healing journey lead me from chiropractic, to homeopathy, to nutritional medicine then eventually to coaching in which I mastered my own laziness around care of myself. With 28 years of working with healing, I'm confident I can reduce pain and relieve suffering.", "sitename": "Yelp", "date": "2012-07-06", "cleaned_text": "Consider Other [read more](/adredir?ad_business_id=jucQWMFe5OLjuxQL7sQi4Q&campaign_id=T8hieRoWUHUTCcUZFpRJTA&click_origin=read_more&placement=above_biz_review&placement_slot=0&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yelp.com%2Fbiz%2Fkenneth-akizuki-md-san-francisco%3Fhrid%3DNDwlv6eOMxPqMPjf0IqcFA&request_id=2543b2dbd2d49b8b&signature=f3ec1d8d8fdebdd8243913ecc5979aff1b1e951c32c7030bfefdfeaa569acad7&slot=0) in Physical Therapy, Sports Medicine [read more](/adredir?ad_business_id=twUgzr0MWqBCSYt2rqz6OQ&campaign_id=y_w_rBLvmefgwkR5FFB1_g&click_origin=read_more&placement=above_biz_review&placement_slot=0&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yelp.com%2Fbiz%2Fnewport-institute-sunol-2%23atb_alias%3AAboutThisBizSpecialties&request_id=2543b2dbd2d49b8b&signature=b76f48d58de258610e4d9ef096e14bc67bbb07a941566ffea5cb8ee9774963be&slot=1) in Counseling & Mental Health, Addiction Medicine, Rehabilitation Center [read more](/adredir?ad_business_id=dQ-xCW1iNfriB14Uvs3a6g&campaign_id=3MbC9UfSTEorznVPKzEq5A&click_origin=read_more&placement=above_biz_review&placement_slot=0&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yelp.com%2Fbiz%2Fcandise-yang-acupuncture-oakland%3Fhrid%3DWPlsiiELlhGB40XJlEMiDw&request_id=2543b2dbd2d49b8b&signature=4eb36d82e1cd613468ab59b5ecfb6db6fe72d621317ccf28fc02a50a3bff9330&slot=2) in Traditional Chinese Medicine, Acupuncture, Naturopathic/holistic About the Business Business owner information Joel K.

I was struggling physically to keep up with the demands of a newborn. I was also emotionally drained from the whole experience and didn't have the support available to deal with the transition. I knew that if I wanted to be a good Mom that I needed to be in the best of health for my son. I reached out to Joel because he offered services that no one else did. I needed some one with a holistic perspective to listen to me, offer coaching and supply nutritional/homeopathic support. I looked forward to our chats each month and always felt complete and empowered afterward. It was great getting a different perspective on my situation and guidance in areas that I was lacking. He encouraged me to start journaling which was also really helpful to look inside myself and understand my anxiety a bit better. After the first couple months, I noticed a definite change in my health and began sleeping better and having much more energy. Thank You Joel! - 7/6/2012First to Review I've been treated by Dr. Kreisberg since 2005 with homeopathy, chiropractic and as a Integral coach. Dr. Kreisberg cares about my well being and I have always recovered from my chronic allergies, body injuries and stress related maladies, in a speedy time after receiving his health care services. His approach is very wholesome and not invasive and always goes to the root of the health issue, without masking it with medication. He provides effective treatments that also benefit the planet because he is not using standard medication and saves me trips to the pharmacy to refill my meds.
