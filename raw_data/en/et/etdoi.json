In Greece, music from a flute or harp was used in an attempt to treat physical ailments like gout and cure mental disorders. To relieve chronic pain and restore harmony in a patient's body, Egyptians used sound energy by composing vowel chants and built chambers to amplify sound and evoke catharsis. Music therapy was offered to wounded soldiers in the Second World War.

It's because the vibration of sound is not only heard through our ears but also through every cell in our bodies. Scientist Itzhak Bentov explains in his book Stalking the Wild Pendulum that when a cell is stressed or diseased, its frequency changes and it starts vibrating discordantly. He hypothesises that when a strong harmonising rhythm is applied, the malfunctioning cell might start beating in tune again. In her book Earth: Pleiadian Keys to the Living Library, Barbara Marciniak concur: \"Sounds that are harmonious activate the body and create healing.\" Previously seen as an alternative therapy, sound healing is increasingly becoming mainstream. Hospitals are even integrating it into their treatment programmes to treat hyperactive children or help older people with neurological problems retrieve their memory. In fact, for Dr Kulreet Chaudhary, a leading neurologist and neuroscientist who is also a practitioner of Ayurvedic medicine, she implements the use of sound therapy into the treatment of chronic neurological conditions like multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's and migraine headaches. As someone who is a big advocate of conscious mindfulness, [Datin Dian Lee](https://www.tatlerasia.com/style/wellness/dian-lee-yoga-wellness-retreat-travel-malaysia-one-and-only-desaru-coast-johor), who's a certified sound healing practitioner and heads the Luna Soul Care Club, sees this modality as a form of meditation to guide one into stillness. \"People might not be comfortable by just sitting quietly with their breath. With sound, the mind has something to cling on to,\" she explains. Our fast-paced lifestyle and our need to be stimulated all the time makes our mind go at hyperspeed and the only way to decompress and slow down our thoughts is via meditation. "}
