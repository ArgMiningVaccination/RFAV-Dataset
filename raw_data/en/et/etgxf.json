What Our Clients Say Working with Whitney has been incredibly empowering as a woman and new mother. She is deeply knowledgeable about women's health and hormone balance, and has helped me recover postpartum with lifestyle, herbs, and a compassionate presence. When my toddler had a few consecutive illnesses, Whitney recommended nutrition and herbal supports that have helped her heal and thrive. -Briana P. I went to Four Seasons Harmony initially for a postpartum Ayurvedic consultation. I was blown away by all the tools I received to better care for myself during this delicate time. Whitney is incredibly knowledgeable and her presence is remarkable. My postpartum journey was graceful and full of joy, I truly felt supported and nurtured the entire time and that led to a super happy, calm, trusting baby! Yay! I felt so good that I came to four seasons harmony for another consult on some other matters and I have found more tools to increase and optimize my health and vibrancy! I highly recommend! -Brenda P. I began Ayurveda consultations nearly two years ago, and it has changed my life. Whitney is warm, wise, and well-informed. Her healing practice begins with her smile and extends through her ability to ask and answer any question in a helpful and hopeful way. I have also seen her for Acupressure and walked away feeling like new. Her practice is trauma-informed, anciently rooted, and intensely relevant for the present day. I've recommended Four Seasons Harmony and Healing Arts to just about anyone I know who is listening deeply to their own journey of awakening and invested in self-care. -Chris H. S. I started seeing Whitney because I was experiencing problems with my menstrual cycles, insomnia, stress and intense pain in my back. As a graduate student, my time is very limited but I gave it a try because I was desperate to get better. Whitney's hands and treatment have been phenomenal. After 3 sessions, I have been extremely happy with the results. My menstrual cycle is back to normal, I no longer have trouble falling asleep, and the pain in my back has been greatly reduced. I think the best part is getting out of her office feeling as if I was walking in the clouds. I can't wait to go back! -Angeliky S. Whitney is a blessing! She is naturally gifted in the Ayurveda approach with education, food, lifestyle, and herbs for healthy living for the unique person. She is both profoundly educated and intuitive, a rare combination to find. Her acupressure and energy work is amazing as well. I highly recommend Whitney for anyone who needs body care or healing. -Mary P. The combination of knowledge, skill, and personalized care Whitney offers is unique. Making the commitment to see her regularly has been instrumental in my improved well being, and one of the best investments I've made in self-care. -Jill R. Whitney Erwin is a very gifted healer, this was evident from the moment I stepped into Four Seasons Harmony for my initial intake. Whitney is an attentive, compassionate listener and takes a very holistic approach to health and well-being. Whitney performed a very thorough intake in order to understand both my physical and emotional needs and challenges. She is a very gifted therapist and her approach is both gentle and intuitive. I highly recommend Whitney's services. -Heather C.
