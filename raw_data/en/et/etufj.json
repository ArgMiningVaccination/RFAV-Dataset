Faubion, MD, FACP, NCMP, IF (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN ) Lisa C. Larkin, MD, FACP, NCMP, IF (University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH) Although disease -preven tion benefits of immunizations are well established, barriers to adult immunization result in a low prevalence of immunization.1 The US National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) updated vaccine recommendations in 2013 and cited barriers to adult immunizat ion: lack of patient and provider knowledge about the need for vaccination; lack of priority for preventive services (as opposed to acute and chronic disease management); concerns regarding out -of-pocket costs, insurance coverage, and reimbursement; and ca re by multiple providers, thus complicating coordination of care. Provider recommendation and offer of immunization during the same visit predicts adult vaccination. To address barriers, NVAC advises that providers not only educate themselves and their pa tients about current vaccine recommendations but also that they include an immunization needs assessment in every clinical encounter , strongly recommend ing and administer ing needed vaccines or refer ring to a provider or pharmacy who can. National standard s for immunizations are set by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in the United States and the National Advisory Committee on Immunizations (NACI) in Canada. Hepatitis A and B vaccines. Hepatitis A and hepatitis B cause acute and chr onic infection of the liver with associated morbidity and mortality. Two approved single -antigen hepatitis A vaccines, two single -antigen hepatitis B vaccines, and one combination hepatitis A -hepatitis B vaccine are available. ACIP recommends routine hepat itis A vaccination of all children aged 1 year and older, and vaccination is recommended for unvaccinated adults with risk factors, including men who have sex with men, illicit -drug users, persons with chronic liver disease, and travelers to countries with intermediate or high rates of hepatitis A. Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for adults with more t han one sex partner in the previous 6 months, healthcare personnel, patients with end -stage renal disease, and adults seen in Immunizations protect individual persons and contrib ute to public health by reducing morbidity and mortality associated with common infectious diseases. In this Practice Pearl , we review guidelines for adult immunizations and recent and potential changes in vaccines. 2 sexually transmitted inf ection and HIV testing and treatment facilities. ACIP recently expanded its recommendation to include all patients with diabetes aged 19 through 59 years and for older patients at the discretion of the clinician. Human papillomavirus vaccine . Human papill omavirus (HPV) is with cervical, vulvar, and vaginal cancer in women; penile cancer in men; and anal and oropharyngeal cancer in men and women. Three HPV vaccines are currently approved for routine vaccination: bivalent, quadrivalent, and 9 -valent. Each of these vaccines protects against HPV types 16 and 18, which account for 66% of cervical cancers. The 9 -valent targets five additional strains that account for an additional 15% of cervical cancers. The quadrivalent and 9 -valent vaccines also protect against HPV 6 and 11, types associated with anogenital warts.2 In the United States, HPV vaccination is recommended in a three -dose series (0, 1-2, 6 mo schedule) for all boys and girls , starting at age 11 or 12 years. In Canada, a two -dose series (0 and 6 mo schedule) also is approved for girls aged 9 to 14 years. In patients not previously vaccinated, vaccination is recommended for women aged up to 26 years, age 21 years for men, and age 26 years for men who have sex with men and immunocompromised patients. In Canada, NACI recommends HPV vacc ination for at -risk women aged older than 26 years, with no upper age limit, although Health Canada has appr oved the vaccine only up to age 45 years.3 This recommendation is in contrast with US guidance \u2014FDA rejected a request to expa nd the use of HPV vacci nation to women aged 27 to 45 years. ACIP has not provided guidance on vaccination in women with documented current or prior HPV infection or in those with HPV -related cervical disease. Clinicians practicing in the United States occasionally encounter unva ccinated women aged older than 26 years who request immunization and are willing to pay out of pocket. In these cases, it is reasonable to offer the vaccine. Influenza vaccine . Annual influenza vaccine is recommended for all persons aged older than 6 mont hs but is especially important for healthcare workers and adults who are elderly or immunocompromised or who have chronic medical conditions. The vaccine components change regularly to reflect circulating strains of the influenza virus. Several vaccines ar e available, including inactivated quadrivalent and trivalent, inactivated trivalent high dose, and live attenuated quadrivalent. Ideally, adults should be vaccinated by October of each year , but unvaccinated adults should continue to be vaccinated through out the flu season, most typically through March. Recombinant influenza vaccine does not contain any egg protein and should be administered to persons with an egg allergy. One study confirmed that in persons aged older than 65 years, the high -dose vaccine is more effective at preventing influenza than the standard -dose vaccine.4 Pneumococcal vaccine . Streptococcus pneumonia remains a leading infectious cause of serious illness in adults and is responsible for at least 500,000 cases of pneumococcal pneumoni a annually, 10% to 25% of which are with bacteremia. The 23 -valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) is recommended by ACIP for all adults aged older than 65 years and younger immunocompromised adults. In 2011, a new 13 -valent pneumoco ccal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was approved by FDA for adults aged 50 years and older to include serotypes responsible for an estimated 10% of community -acquired pneumonia cases in adults aged older than 65 years .5 In 2014, ACIP updated its recommendation to include routine vaccination of all adults aged older than 65 years and adults aged younger than 65 years who are immunocompromised or at risk for invasive pneumococcal disease. Pneumococcal vaccine -naive 3 adults aged older than 65 years should receive PC V13 first, followed by PPV23 at least 1 year subsequently. Adults aged older than 65 years who have previously received PPV23 should receive PCV13 at least 1 year subsequently. Immunocompromised vaccine -naive adults should receive PCV13 , followed by PPV23 8 weeks later , and additional PPV23 vaccination at 5 -year intervals, with a maximum of three doses in a lifetime (one given after age 65 years and at least 5 years after the previous dose) , per ACIP recommendations; Canadian guidelines suggest a single re immunization for those at highest risk. There is no reco mmendation for repeat dosing of PPV13 .6 Tetanus (Td) and Tdap vaccines . A one -time dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) booster (rather than the d ecennial dose of Td) is recommended for adults who have not previously received Tdap. In 2001, FDA expanded the age indication for Tdap to include those aged older than 65 years.7 Tdap may be given regardless of the interval since the last tetanus or dipht heria -toxoid vaccine. A single dose of Tdap is recommended for providers with direct patient care contact who have not received the vaccine as an adult and for persons aged older than 65 years who have or anticipate close contact with an infant aged younge r than 1 year and who have not previously received Tdap to prevent and reduce transmission of pertussis (eg, adults who have recently become grandparents). Adults aged older than 65 years who have not previously received Tdap can receive a single dose in place of Td.7 Zoster vaccine . Not only does the risk of herpes zoster (shingles) increase with age , but the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia, interference with daily activities, and hospitalizat ions in those affected increases as well. To prevent herpes zoster, FDA has approved a live vaccine for adults aged older than 50 years, although ACIP recommen ds immunization for adults aged 60 years and older. Adults aged older than 60 years should be immunized regardless of shingles history. Adults with chronic medical conditions should be vaccinated; however, pregnancy, immunodeficiency , and use of chronic steroids are contraindications.8 Although protection from the vaccine declines after 5 years, there are no current guidelines for repeat vaccination. A study of a herpes zoster subunit vaccine conducted in older adults revealed efficacy of more than 97% in all age groups, including those aged older than 70 years.9 References 1.
