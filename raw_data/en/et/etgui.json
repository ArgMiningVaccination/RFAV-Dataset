Currently, his professional focus as a scientist and professor (Brigham Young University) is to better understand the role of elevated insulin in regulating obesity and diabetes, including the relevance of ketones in mitochondrial function. In today's episode, Dr. Bikman teaches about insulin resistance, including its role in weight gain, diabetes, stress, hormone imbalances, PCOS, and inflammation. He goes into detail about how insulin resistance affects the body, how it is diagnosed, and how one can begin to heal from it. Over 88% of people suffer from insulin resistance, and so it is a topic we need to be educated on. As mentioned in the podcast, 110 cm is 43.3 inches (when talking about a man's waist in determining whether they have insulin resistance).
