Currently, military members and their families have little to no access to CAM through their military treatment facilities or through their insurance (Tricare), but they are still using CAM as an out of pocket expense. They would like greater access to CAM within the military healthcare system, and research is currently being conducted to establish whether it is justified. However, I feel that it is necessary for this group of people to have access to the CAM modalities that I can offer to them now. This paper will provide the reasoning for providing CAM services and a business plan for starting a holistic health business within this military community. STARTING A HOLISTIC HEALTH PRACTICE IN A MILITARY 3 Starting a Holistic Health Practice in a Military Community Introduction As complementary and alternative (CAM) modalities become more widely known, accepted, and used amongst the general population (\"What's in a Name?,\" 2014), military members and their families are also using CAM modalities to support their health issues and for prevention. CAM is defined in several distinct definitions by the National Institutes of Health (NIH): \"Complementary generally refers to using a non-mainstream approach together with conventional medicine\" (\"What's in a Name?,\" 2014, para. 2); \"Alternative refers to using a non-mainstream approach in place of conventional medicine\" (\"What's in a Name?,\" 2014, para. 2); and integrative medicine generally refers to medical facilities incorporating non-mainstream approaches with contemporary treatment. For example, a cancer treatment center may offer acupuncture, meditation, or healing touch along with chemotherapy (\"What's in a Name?,\" 2014, p. 4). NIH categorizes CAM modalities into two subgroups - natural products and mind body practices. Included in the natural products are herbs, vitamins, minerals, and essential oils. The mind body practices include acupuncture, massage therapy, meditation, movement therapies, relaxation techniques, spinal manipulation, tai chi, yoga, healing touch, and hypnotherapy (\"What's in a Name?,\" 2014, para. 6 and 7). Currently, military members have access to the CAM modality of chiropractic in certain locations (\"Military Bases Offering Chiropractic,\" n.d.), but only 54% of them live close enough to have access to a military chiropractic clinic (Goertz et al., 2013). The Veterans' Administration is only just beginning to provide chiropractic care in certain locations to veterans (\"VA to Provide Chiropractic Care,\" n.d.). STARTING A HOLISTIC HEALTH PRACTICE IN A MILITARY 4 Certain military installations also provide relaxation rooms in Health and Wellness Centers (HAWC) that provide soothing music, a massage chair, and aromatherapy for military members (\"Relaxation Room,\" 2012). However, family members do not have access to chiropractic services or the relaxation rooms on the military installations. The health insurance (Tricare) utilized by the military for their members and family members does not cover CAM modalities such as acupuncture, chiropractic, homeopathic remedies and herbal drugs, multivitamins, massage, or naturopathic care at this time (\"Is it covered?,\" n.d.). The purpose of this paper is to develop the reasons and justification for starting a holistic healthcare practice that specializes in aromatherapy, light therapy, and energy healing modalities in a military community. A holistic healthcare practice will offer an opportunity for military members, their families, and veterans to use these CAM modalities as they strive to find balance and support for their health issues. A business plan (Appendix) is included with this paper as a formal way to structure the business that will be started in a military community. A business plan is important in identifying goals and objectives, financial outlook, marketing strategies, competitors, and the unique abilities of the business owner when starting a new business to determine whether the business will be successful. An important question that I asked when starting the business plan was - do military members want access to CAM modalities? In a cross sectional study published in 2013, researchers found that 45% of military member respondents had used at least one type of CAM in the last year, which is a greater percentage than the civilian population (Goertz et al., 2013). One recent master's level thesis polled a group of military members and their families about CAM use and found that many family members and military members want more access to CAM than is provided by the military healthcare system (Lawrence, 2014). In another recent study, the researchers found that 70% of active duty respondents and 76% of veteran respondents STARTING A HOLISTIC HEALTH PRACTICE IN A MILITARY 5 would like to see more CAM services offered at medical treatment facilities (MTFs) or at VA hospitals (Reinhard et al., 2014). Military members and veterans use CAM for health issues such as PTSD, depression, chronic pain, stress, health promotion, and disease prevention. The types of CAM that were reported most often use were massage, chiropractic, relaxation, spiritual healing, and herbal therapy (Reinhard et al., 2014). My qualifications for starting a holistic health practice in a military community are as follows: 1. I am a veteran. I served in the US Air Force for 12 years and used CAM when allopathic medicine did not help me with pain that I developed during pilot training. I understand the frustration that comes with not receiving the relief that one expects after being advised by a conventional medical professional. I found relief in complementary modalities that weren't offered in the MTF. 2. I hold diplomas in holistic health practice, aromatherapy, and holistic nutrition from the American College of Healthcare Sciences (ACHS). I have been studying for over four years to learn and hone my skills as a holistic practitioner. 3. I am a certified Simply Healed Method practitioner and am almost complete with the qualifications to be a certified Quantum Light Energy Coach through the Board of Advanced Natural Health Sciences (BANHS). 4. I have completed over 200 hours of mentoring training through classes with the 3 Key Elements company. This unique set of modalities is concurrent with some of the modalities that military members are reporting as having used and enables me to empower military members, their families, and veterans with tools that they could use to support themselves in their healing journeys. Methods The methods used for researching this paper included Internet searches, book research, watching webinars, and personal experience. Many search terms were used to find the information needed for this paper and the business plan and included: 'aromatherapy and STARTING A HOLISTIC HEALTH PRACTICE IN A MILITARY 6 military', 'essential oils and military', 'light therapy and Okinawa', coping and military', 'CAM and Webinars from the American College of Healthcare Sciences' (ACHS) graduates also helped to serve as rational for this project. The method used for writing the business plan came from LivePlan online software (LivePlan, 2014). A sample business plan from Sohnen-Moe Associates, Inc. was consulted as well (\"Business Plan Toolkit,\" 2014). The search engines, libraries, and websites used to research were Google, Google Scholar, PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, AromaticScience.com, and the ACHS library. Results The search engines and libraries were a good starting place in finding research studies to substantiate the need for this type of business. A lot of sorting was required. For example, the search terms of 'aromatherapy and military' led to 3,420 results in Google Scholar but only a few of the studies were applicable to the scope of this project. The same proved true for the other search engines and libraries. Often the research studies that were used referenced additional studies that were helpful as additional information. In order to find the documentation needed for the business plan, I used the Internet to find competitors and numbers. Two competitors appeared in Google searches - one is on the military base and one is off the base. They are listed in the business plan. Since I am currently not located on the military base, I am not able to search for other competitors that aren't found on the Internet until I arrive on the base. I did have to use Wikipedia in order to find the numbers of military members, family members, and American civilians that live on the island of Okinawa (\"Okinawa Prefecture,\" STARTING A HOLISTIC HEALTH PRACTICE IN A MILITARY 7 2014). I was not able to find specific numbers for how much money military members spend on CAM, so I used the numbers that the NIH reported in 2009 from a study done in 2007 (\"Out-of-Pocket on CAM,\" 2009). This translates to $150/American/year (\"Americans spend $33.9 billion,\" 2009). The financial numbers in the business plan come from the numbers of sessions that I am willing to do each day multiplied by the number of days per month multiplied by the rates that I charge for those sessions. The income numbers from doTERRA commissions are not hypothetical but are already established. Discussion Brandie Lawrence (2014), an ACHS graduate, was able to interview and poll several military members and their family members in a 21-item questionnaire about their CAM use. Her research found that of the people polled, 83% responded that they used CAM - after learning the definition of CAM. The top three modalities used amongst this group of adults were prayer, massage, and a tie between chiropractic/herbs/nutrition. The top three modalities used by adults with their children were essential oils, essential oils, and a tie between chiropractic/herbs/nutrition. The percentage of adults that used these modalities daily was 75%, and the percentage of children using them daily was 63% with 93% of these participants rating these modalities 'extremely helpful' or 'helpful'. 80% of participants also expressed a greater desire to have access to CAM on military bases (Lawrence, 2014). This was a small group study done mainly in one locale, but I believe that it represents attitudes at large in the military community. My personal experience with CAM began early in my military career. I had unexplained headaches after beginning pilot training. After seeing a number of different doctors with no diagnosis, I was very frustrated. Luckily for me, an osteopathic doctor decided to ask my primary care physician if he could help. He was given permission and started adjusting and STARTING A HOLISTIC HEALTH PRACTICE IN A MILITARY 8 massaging my neck and having me do daily neck strengthening exercises. After three weeks the pain was gone. I continued to do the exercises, receive massages, and stretch my neck. I realized that I didn't have to use pharmaceutical medication in order to heal my body's imbalances. This led me to other modalities such as essential oils, herbs, and energy healing (T. S. Olsen, personal recollection, 22 December, 2014). After my military career, I decided that I wanted to pursue work with CAM and the military. In the four years that I have studied with ACHS, I have learned much about using CAM for my family and myself and want to help those in the military who also want to learn how to use these modalities for themselves and their families. I was not part of Lawrence's study (2014) but I would have been another positive data point in her research. As chronic health problems increase for veterans and military members, they are turning to CAM when conventional care doesn't address all of their health issues. According to another recent study, 27% of veterans seen by VA facilities had used CAM within the last year (Reinhard et al., 2014). The figure was higher amongst active duty military personnel - (37-41%), and they used CAM for 'chronic pain conditions, stress, depression, health promotion, and disease prevention' (Reinhard et al., 2014). A study by McPherson and Schwenka (2004) found that CAM use among active duty military members was increasing and due to the increased out of pocket expense, 70% of them desired CAM to be offered at their MTF. Interestingly enough, ten years after this study, MTFs are still not offering CAM to their clients with the exception of chiropractic at certain installations. According to a survey done by the American Legion, 59% of veterans are dealing with traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and 30% are dealing with PTSD. Of the 3,100 respondents, \"59% reported either feeling no improvement or worse after undergoing conventional TBI and PTSD treatment. And 30% said they had terminated their treatment plan before completion.\" (Brooks, 2014, para. 2). Almost half of the participants had discussed CAM options with their providers, STARTING A HOLISTIC HEALTH PRACTICE IN A MILITARY 9 and reported that they had used CAM treatments on their own including meditation, relaxation techniques, and stress reduction techniques (Brooks, 2014). VA officials discussed using CAM in treatment plans after the survey results were published since 60% of veterans who have used traditional treatments still meet the criteria for PTSD. Lt. Col. Dennis McGurk, deputy director of the Army Medical Research and Material Command, said that if those suffering from TBI or PTSD can get more sleep then \"the patient is more likely to return for additional treatments\" (Brooks, 2014, para. 12). CAM often helps people sleep better and could be used as an integrative option. This survey also brought to light the support that the caregivers of these military members and veterans need. They often suffer from a great deal of stress and sleeplessness as they care for their veterans and need tools to help themselves cope as well. Currently there are thirteen studies being conducted by NIH and the Department of Veteran's Affairs with a budget of $21.7 million that are addressing pain management, PTSD, drug abuse, and sleep issues amongst veterans and military members (\"NIH and VA address pain and related conditions in US military personnel, veterans, and their families,\" 2014). The director of NCCAM, Josephine P. Briggs has said that, \"Pain is the most common reason Americans turn to complementary and integrative health practices. The need for nondrug treatment options is a significant and urgent public health imperative. We believe this research will provide much needed information that will help our military and their family members, and ultimately anyone suffering from chronic pain and related conditions\" (\"NIH and VA address pain and related conditions in US military personnel, veterans, and their families,\" 2014, para. 3). While this research is being completed though, military members and their families will still be looking for these modalities and paying out of pocket for them which is the reason for starting my holistic health practice in this military community. STARTING A HOLISTIC HEALTH PRACTICE IN A MILITARY 10 Aromatherapy The modality of aromatherapy can help military members, their family members, and veterans due to the direct link to the limbic system of the brain. Aromatherapy is the therapeutic use of aromatic plant extracts either topically, aromatically, or internally to affect a desired outcome in the body. Essential oils are made up of many chemical constituents that have a wide range of therapeutic value. Essential oil molecules travel from the nasal passages through the olfactory nerve and bulb where they have access to the limbic system. The limbic system is \"a group of related structures in the brain that are responsible for processing emotion, memory, and smell\" (Modern Essentials, 2013, p. 8). The amygdala, a part of the limbic system, has been found to play a part in storing and releasing emotional trauma. This gland can be stimulated by fragrance which is why using essential oils can be helpful when working with emotional trauma (Modern Essentials, 2013). It is important to ensure that when using essential oils, the aromatherapist is aware of any other drugs being used because of drug interactions. However, essential oils could be very effective in helping to manage anxiety, insomnia, and depression associated with PTSD (Houk, n.d.). According to a literature review by Perry & Perry (2006), the benefits of aromatherapy have been studied and documented for \"agitation, insomnia, wandering, difficult behavior, and social withdrawal.\" Even though they were discussing the behaviors related to dementia, they still seem to apply to other brain disorders such as PTSD and TBI. The most common essential oils used according this review were lavender Lavandula angustifolia and Melissa Melissa officinalis (Perry & Perry, 2006). Essential oils can also be used to mitigate pain. Military members often suffer from chronic pain, and many of the studies used to research this paper mentioned the high pain levels of veterans. Along with pain often comes prescription drug use. Many veterans polled don't like STARTING A HOLISTIC HEALTH PRACTICE IN A MILITARY 11 the side effects associated with painkillers or opiods. Essential oils are not addictive and therefore, could be a safer alternative to painkillers. Light Therapy Low level light therapy (LLLT) using light emitting diodes (LEDs) that function at certain wavelengths, frequencies, and colors also help to reduce pain and stress in the body. Kim & Calderhead (2011) reported that \"LED phototherapy has now been well-proven to work, and is reported to be effective in a large variety of clinical indications such as pain attenuation, wound healing, skin rejuvenation, some viral diseases, allergic rhinitis, other related allergy-related conditions and so on\" (Kim & Calderhead, 2011, p. 209). They go on to explain that visible light can induce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, and infrared light can start cell membrane transport mechanisms like the sodium and potassium pumps. ATP is important for energy at a cellular level. The LED lights also increase nitric oxide (NO) production within the cells which is helpful for wound healing at a cellular level (Adamskaya et al., 2011). Different than lasers that can irradiate and are concentrated only in a small area, LED light systems can disperse the light over a larger area of the body in a safe, noninvasive manner. The system that I use can be programmed to different frequencies, but the wavelengths of red (640nm), blue (440nm), and infrared (880nm) are constant. Two case studies were reported in 2011 dealing with LED therapy and TBIs. It was discovered that LED lights applied to the head \"may improve cognition, reduce costs of TBI treatment, and be applied at home\" (Naeser, Saltmarche, Krengel, Hamblin, & Knight, 2011, p. 351). The first participant reported better concentration and sleep after using the LED system even though her TBI happened seven years previously to using the system. The second participant was a retired military member who after several brain injuries in the military experienced another TBI after retiring. She wasn't able to work at her consulting job until she STARTING A HOLISTIC HEALTH PRACTICE IN A MILITARY 12 used an LED system for four months. She was then able to return to work full-time and discontinue her medical disability (Naeser et al., 2011). The authors feel that the reasons for these results have been documented in other studies and include an increase in cellular respiration, an increase in ATP production, and an increase in nerve cell growth. Energy Healing The definition of energy healing is \"a form of complementary and alternative medicine based on the belief that a vital energy flows through the human body. The goal of energy healing is to balance the energy flow in the patient. It is used to reduce stress and anxiety and promote well-being. Energy healing is being studied in patients receiving cancer therapy, to find out if it can improve quality of life, boost the immune system, or reduce side effects. Also called energy therapy\" (\"Energy Healing,\" 2013, screen). In the study by Goertz et al. (2013), they found that \"significantly more military personnel reported use of energy healing, guided imagery therapy, massage therapy, hypnosis and relaxation techniques than civilians in both NHIS surveys...\" (Goertz et al., 2013, p. 511). Currently there are no studies being done with the military using the form of energy healing that I use (the Simply Healed Method), but there are studies that have mentioned military members using energy healing modalities such as Reiki. Conclusions After studying the surveys and polls about CAM use within the military that have been conducted over the last ten years, I feel that there is more than enough evidence to move forward with starting a holistic health practice in a specific military community. There is a large military presence in this community (27,000 military members and 22,000 family members) that will provide clients for my small practice. I feel that I will be able to empower individuals and promote holistic tools that will provide options for this community as they look for support for their health concerns such as discomfort, stress, and imbalance. Using this experience of STARTING A HOLISTIC HEALTH PRACTICE IN A MILITARY 13 studying the current data and writing a business plan along with my years of study at ACHS and my military experience has prepared me to begin my work as a holistic health practitioner in a military community.STARTING A HOLISTIC HEALTH PRACTICE IN A MILITARY 14 References Adamskaya, N., Dungel, P., Mittermayr, R., Hartinger, J., Feichtinger, G., Wassermann, K., ...

The goal of Light Essentials Wellness is to provide hope and healing to veterans, active duty military members, and their families as they look for holistic support to balance the difficult things they've experienced during their careers. As a 12 year Air Force veteran, I want to help people find peace and be able to move forward in their lives by empowering them with holistic tools such as light therapy, aromatherapy, and mentoring just as I used when I was frustrated with allopathic medicine while in pilot training. I am grateful for the people who shared their knowledge with me, and I want to do the same for other military members.

This business plan contains confidential, trade-secret information and is shared only with the understanding that you will not share its contents or ideas with third parties without the express written consent of the plan author. Who We Sell To My target market is made up of active duty military members, their family members, and veterans within a military community. I will also reach out to others who support the military in the community and who are ready to begin the healing process physically or emotionally. Financial Summary Because of my position in doTERRA, I currently earn approximately $7000/month in commissions. Simply Healed, Light therapy, and mentoring sessions will bring in about $3000/month. I have calculated this by the number of sessions that I will conduct per week (12-16) multiplied by the session price ($50) multiplied by 4 weeks. Due to starting the business out of my home on the Air Force base with appropriate licenses, I will not pay rent for the business initially. Expenses will come in the form of legal fees to ensure compliance, licenses, supplies, inventory, liability insurance, and salary. Goals and Priorities I bring knowledge, joy, and wellness to myself and my clients in a safe and comfortable environment. Goals: I provide a professional and competent holistic health practice by being fully present while working with clients, educating clients about holistic modalities, reviewing clients' files before a session, keeping excellent records, and keeping my equipment clean and in good condition. I meet with 4 clients per day from 10:00am until 2:00pm on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. This allows for me to prepare each day before I meet with clients and allows for me to spend time with my children when they return home from school after 2:00pm. I continue to increase my knowledge and skills by taking online classes, reading at least 3 books in my profession every 6 months, attending at least 2 workshops each year, and maintaining my certifications before they come due. I earn at least $50,000/ year after expenses. I make and keep a budget. I utilize an accountant to ensure that taxes and accounts are paid and on time. I invest 10% towards my retirement.

Products and Services Products and Services Products: I offer doTERRA essential oils and wellness products. These essential oils are sourced from the places around the world where they originated and are Certified Pure Therapeutic Grade essential oils that can be used topically, aromatically, and in many cases internally. These oils are tested by two independent laboratories to ensure the high quality that doTERRA expects from the oils they sell. Services: I offer Carolyn Cooper's Simply Healed Method energy sessions in 50 minute sessions Simply Healed is an easy way to clear negative energy or blocks from our bodies in a non-invasive way. It helps with many issues and can clear generational issues as well. I offer LED light therapy sessions using an Elan LED light system that relaxes the body, reduces stress and discomfort, and increases ATP and nitric oxide at the cellular level. I offer Mentoring sessions and packages for people who want to move past their limiting beliefs and mental blocks. Competitors There are many places in Okinawa that offer essential oils. They can be purchased anywhere from the natural food stores to the dollar store. The quality of those oils is very suspect due to the lack of regulation of essential oils. There are a few doTERRA consultants in Okinawa at this time, but I will be the only one on the Air Force base that is a master aromatherapist using this brand of oils. There is another certified aromatherapist who uses a different brand of essential oils. Her name is Amber Duncan and has a website called www.holistichealthhelper.com. She teaches classes on the science and uses of essential oils. She also practices Reiki. I did find a spa/aromatherapy store called Petaluna that maintains their website in English and Japanese - www.petaluna.com/english. It is located near Kadena AB. They offer essential oils and products made with essential oils such as soap and bodycare products as well as offering massages using essential oils.

I am the only Simply Healed practitioner on Okinawa. The closest Simply Healed practitioners live in Australia. There are many other Reiki and other energy practitioners in Okinawa though. Many of them are Japanese, so I haven't been able to find their information. I know that they are there from living in Okinawa 8 years ago.

Target Market Market Overview Although I can work with anyone, I am choosing to work with veterans, active duty military members, and their families as my target market. There is a lot of tragedy associated with PTSD, readjusting to life back at home, and being a member of a family. My goal is to help veterans feel comfortable back in society by helping them clear the issues that are keeping them from feeling like they felt before their hard experiences. This will be a complementary approach since many of them will be working with mental health professionals as well. Energy healing is a growing trend. People are looking for alternative ways to help their bodies heal. Essential oils also play a role in physical and emotional healing and are becoming more popular. Market Needs I help those associated with the military to learn tools such as using essential oils, light therapy, and mentoring to overcome the challenges they face as well as empowering them with education and hope. I provide a suggested individualized program for each client. However, I will not diagnose any medical condition nor prescribe any treatment. I will work to support their needs around their current medical care and advise them to consult with their primary care physician. I know how to talk in military vernacular, so my clients can feel comfortable in knowing that I understand what they want and need.

Strategy and Implementation Marketing Plan Overview I will have a grand opening by 27 February 2015. I will be focusing on doTERRA essential oils, Simply Healed energy sessions, light therapy sessions, and mentoring . I will distribute flyers and will send Facebook announcements. I will make food that is made with essential oils as well as have door prizes, free essential oil samples, and free bio-feedback scans. After the grand opening we will schedule classes to help the public know about our products and services. Word of mouth works very well in this area. I will also look into other advertising as we go. I am also listed on the Carolyn Cooper Simply Healed Practitioner website as a certified Simply Healed practitioner. Positioning I am Light Essentials Wellness. I help people who are ready to be empowered and take control of their health - especially veterans, active duty military members, and their families. I am happy when my clients feel better physically and emotionally. Pricing I don't need to create my products or services. I buy my doTERRA products wholesale prices and sell them at retail prices. The Simply Healed sessions don't have any products associated with them, so time is the most precious commodity in that service. I plan on offering free classes to teach people about essential oils and nutrition. I will also offer 20 minute free Simply Healed sessions for first time clients. I offer 50 minute Simply Healed session for $50/session to people associated with the military. I will offer military packages of 5 sessions for $195. The Simply Healed sessions that are scheduled from the website will be $90/50 minute session. This price is slightly less than other Simply Healed practitioners charge currently (around $100/session). Light Essentials Wellness Page 11 of 27 CONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT DISSEMINATE.

A military package of 5 sessions for $195 will be available. My mentoring packages are priced at $50/hour or 5 sessions for $195. Promotion I will also advertise in the base magazine and newspaper. That gets widest distribution among the military members on Okinawa. I am listed as a certified Simply Healed practitioner on the Carolyn Cooper Simply Healed webpage. I will carry my business cards and wear promotional clothing while I am out in the community. I will use my website to promote my products and services. The website will be updated by the grand opening after I know the location of the office. Distribution I will sell doTERRA products directly to my customers from my inventory as well as having them available online for purchase. The online purchases are sent from the doTERRA company. I will have an online calendar on my website that clients can schedule appointments for a Simply Healed session, a light therapy session, or a mentoring session.

I need to find an insurance company that will work with me for liability insurance. I have some options.

Testimonials Testimonials Simply Healed Testimonials for Tammy Olsen 1. Tammy introduced me to the Simply Healed method a couple of years ago. It has been a wonderfully positive experience for me and has helped me in a number of ways. She has helped my husband and me in several aspects of our business, clearing out false beliefs about money and raising the vibration of energy at work and between our employees. She has helped me to strengthen my relationships with my family. In my personal life, I have benefitted in my self- esteem and confidence as well as experiencing better physical health.

This business plan contains confidential, trade-secret information and is shared only with the understanding that you will not share its contents or ideas with third parties without the express written consent of the plan author. Recently, I was worried about my college- aged child moving home. Through a session with Tammy I was able to look forward to his coming and have peace. We even raised the energy vibration in my home in preparation for his return. The thing I like the most is that Tammy can find what needs to be changed for me and my loved ones, even if I am not aware of that specific need. Life feels great after every session! C.G. Colorado Springs, CO 2. Tammy has helped me do some emotional clearing several times- for business and personal issues. It is amazing to me how she can ask the right questions, and help me pull those emotions to the surface, and then just clear them away. She has helped me overcome some mental blocks that were preventing me from accomplishing my goals and moving forward. Working with Tammy is always an enlightening and thought-provoking experience that leaves me feeling more at peace. Tammy has a loving, empathetic heart and a real gift for healing. M.F. Springfield, VA 3. I can not say enough about Simply Healed. Our 2 yr old has been struggling with her speech and has been displaying some behaviors that are typical of autism. After just one Simply Healed session she has added several words to her vocabulary and has also stopped banging her head. I feel like I'm actually communicating with her now. Thank you for giving parents a way to help their children with out using harmful drugs. M.L. Payson, UT Light Essentials Wellness Page 26 of 27 CONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT DISSEMINATE.

I am so grateful for Simply Healed! I love the feeling I get when something has been cleared for me. It is so wonderful to know that there are reasons for the way I feel and once I know what they are, I can get rid of them forever! I'm excited for the day when I can become certified to do Simply Healed! It has changed my life and I want to help others change their lives! Thank you Tammy and Carolyn for your gifts and sharing them with the rest of us! H.B. Indianapolis, IN 5. I want to say how much I appreciate the clearing of energies I have received from Tammy Olsen, it has been life changing for me. The first thing is I want to say is that Tammy provides me with such a safe environment. I feel comfortable with her going to those areas she needs to access. I don't fully understand what she does but it works. Second I would like to talk about a very recent session I had with Tammy a few days ago. It was one of the biggest energy moving sessions I have ever had. I actually slept for 36 hours off and on so my body could process and take care of the energy change. When I was I done, some exciting things started to occur. I started attracting the people I needed for my business and the money flow is getting stronger. I know I have more work to do, but I feel blessed I have Tammy Olsen and her skills as a powerful tool to facilitate the changes when needed. S.S Denver, CO Insurance Options Insurance Options I have several options for obtaining liability insurance.
