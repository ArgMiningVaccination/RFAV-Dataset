Background: Many cancer patients use cancer diets. Materials and Methods: We listed 13 cancer dietssimulating an internet search for which we systematicallyreviewed clinical data. In the next step we derivedrecommendations on counseling patients using a Delphiprocess. Results: We evaluated the following diets: rawvegetables and fruits, macrobiotics, Gerson'sregime, Budwig's and low carbohydrate or ketogenic diet.We did not find clinical evidence supporting any of thediets. Furthermore, case reports and pre-clinical data pointto the potential harm of some of these diets. Frompublished recommendations on counseling oncomplementary and alternative medicine, we were able toderive 14 recommendations for counseling on cancer diets.Conclusion: Considering the lack of evidence of benefitsfrom cancer diets and potential harm by malnutrition,oncologists should engage more in counseling cancerpatients on such diets. Our recommendations could behelpful in this process.Many patients with cancer use certain complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). International data shows thatthe user rate is approximately 50% (1). The types of CAM methods preferred by patients are very similar in different surveys. Biological-based methods are mostoften used in Western countries. In this context, diets andnutritional supplements are most often listed (1, 2). This isunderstandable as patients often believe pollutants from theenvironment and an impaired immune system are causes ofcancer (3). Accordingly, patients search for means to strengthentheir immune system and detoxify the body. Intuitively,changes in diet and consumption of supplements are the easiestway to add apparently lacking substances. However, the effectsof pollutants may be counteracted by adding e.g.antioxidants or alkaline substances which adjust acidity. In a review ofinternational CAM use data in patients with gynecologicalcancer, Eschiti and colleagues noted that 75% of patientsfollowed a special diet, used supplements, or both (4). Even for scientists and clinicians, the question of whether and how nutrition may influence cancer risk and prognosisis controversial as the available data are highly complex [seee.g.the report of the World Cancer Research Fund (5)]. Patients searching for information on what they can additionally do to fight their disease mostly rely on family,friends and the media. Non-disclosure of the use od CAM,especially of diets, supplements and herbs, to the oncologist isfrequent (6). One reason for this is, that patients are convinced,the oncologist does not have sufficient knowledge on CAM.Furthermore, others are certain that the oncologist does notneed the information, and in many cases, the simply Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

Only a minority of therapists in oncology feel proficiently-qualified to communicate with patients on CAM(7), since nutrition, diets, and in particular cancer diets, are notpart of curricula for medical students or young physiciansspecializing in oncology in Germany and other countries.Moreover, a lack of evidence from epidemiological and clinicaldata makes this field even more doubtful for clinicians who aretrained in evidence-based medicine. Patients looking for dietinformation may be disappointed by answers that do not give aprecise prescription on what to eat and what to avoid. Diets have had special meaning with respect to culture and religion. Diets define rules and promise health, not only forthe body but also in the mental and social context. Many arenot based on scientific findings [ e.g.food faddism (8)]. The goal of our article is to provide information about cancer dietsto physicians and other caregivers and to providerecommendations on how to discuss cancer diets with patientsin order to support evidence-based shared decision-making. Materials and Methods In order to provide information on cancer diets and how to discuss these diets with patients we did the following: established a list ofthe most often used and quoted cancer diets in the Western world;systematically collected the available clinical data on these diets,analyzed and evaluated the information; researched the evidence oncounseling cancer patients on CAM. Resulting from this work, we propose a list of recommendations on how to counsel and inform patients on cancer diets. List of cancer diets. To derive a list of the most important cancer diets we combined several approaches: Simulation of a patientsearching the internet with the term \"cancer diet\" in four searchengines (Google from different countries: Germany, France; USA,Canada in the respective native language). As we have focused ondealing with patients from Western cultures, we elected to use thesearch engine Google from two European countries and two NorthAmerican countries for this article. We reviewed the first 100website hits for types of cancer diet mentioned. This search wascarried out on July 10, 2012. Collection and evaluation of clinical data on these diets. The description of every diet is derived from original publications of thecreator and descriptions on the internet as observed during ourGoogle search. For every diet, we performed a systematic Medlinesearch (on August 20, 2012) focusing on clinical data. In order to assess all publications we used a systematic approach. Starting with the MeSH-term \"diet\", we used MeSH terminology inorder to search were combined in one search by \"OR\". This first list of hits wasspecified by restriction to cancer (\"AND\" \"neoplasm\"), andadditionally using filters focus Trial; Meta-Analysis; Randomized Controlled Trial; Review). For those diets which could not be assessed using MeSH terms (alkaline diet, Bircher-Benner diet, Breuss cure, Budwig diet,Gerson diet, Kelley/Gonzalez Regimen, Livingston-WheelerRegimen, Moermann diet, raw food diet, vegan diet), we used the most common names in order to build the search. We assessed each article by title and abstract, if it referred to the respective diet. The full text of all articles describing a diet wereanalyzed in full text for clinical data and endpoints. We reviewedarticles from the literature lists and expanded our search until nofurther articles were found. In order to derive recommendations, we distinguished positive recommendations for something from negative ones againstsomething. Following scientific practice e.g.with herbs, controlled, if possible randomized clinical studies are mandatory as scientificevidence for the efficacy of a diet and the basis of a positiverecommendation. Risks may be derived from case reports and evenpreclinical data. Therefore we additionally screened all publicationsselected focusing on safety aspects. Evidence on counseling patients on CAM. Cancer diets are part of the overall concept of CAM. Patients use cancer diets for the samereasons as other CAM strategies. Thus, effectively discussing thesediets with patients should follow the same strategy as for discussingCAM in general. In 2010, Schofield and colleagues (9) published asystematic review on discussing CAM with cancer patients. Theyderived a list of 10 recommendations for clinicians. An expert teamof the working group Prevention and Integrative Oncology of theGerman Cancer Society has adapted these recommendations to thesetting of institutional CAM counseling (10). These rules describethe whole process from preparation to final report and follow-up. Schofield et al. 's recommendations are highly effective. Thus, we decided to use them for our counseling recommendations on cancerdiets. We performed an update of Shofield at al.'s findings by aMedline search following the same search strategy [(cancer ORneoplasm) AND (physician-patient relations OR doctor-patientcommunication) AND (CAM OR complementary and alternativemedicine OR complementary therapies OR alternative therapies ORunproven therapies)]. List of recommendations. We formed a new team of experts from the field of nutrition in cancer and from the field of CAM. Membersof this team, leading experts on CAM in the German Cancer Societyand the German Society for Radiooncology, were the core groupthat had formerly worked on the adaptations from Schofield et al. This new group agreed on a set of recommendations for counselingon cancer diets. The final agreement was made up by a DelphiProcess (see Figure 1). Results Cancer diets. The results of the simulated search with the term \"cancer diet\" by country are provided in Table I. Further results included multiple hits from the same sites from different addresses. We excluded sites discussingnutrition in cancer or supplements and plant extracts andother methods such as vitamin B17 (bitter almonds or seedsfrom apricots) and Essiac (a tea composition). Some dietslike Anem\u00fcller-Ries or Kuhl were only mentioned in reviewarticles without recommendation, and therefore were notconsidered in this review. In the scientific search, we decided to include diets that are relevant in more than one country (Table I). ANTICANCER RESEARCH 34: 39-48 (2014) 40Clinical data on cancer diets. The results of the Medline search for clinical studies are presented in Table II, whichgives an overview on all 13 diets identified. For thefollowing diets clinical data have been published: Gerson's regimen. The diet has been combined with various other approaches to stimulate metabolism as raw liverextract, pancreatic and thyroid extracts or Lugol's solutioncontaining iodine. Infusions of potassium, glucose andinsulin are also described in recent reports (11, 12).According to the advocates, treatment should be continuedfor months or years until cure is achieved (12). Neither Gerson (13, 14) nor Cope (15) present scientific data on the alleged cure of cancer. Hildenbrandt et al. (16) from the Gerson Research Organization published aretrospective comparison of survival of patients with melanoma. Yet, this comparison was made with differentcontrol groups and the authors did not adhere to a singleclassification of tumor staging. Thus, no conclusionregarding the efficacy of the regimen is possible. Lechner and Kronberger (17) describe 18 matched pairs of one patient with different types of cancer and a control person.Patients with Gerson's therapy had a better survival. However,from the publication, we cannot derive whether the matcheswere truly comparable regarding disease and treatment. Molassiotis and Peat (18) analyzed six case reports. In one, long-term survival is described in a patient withmelanoma, which could be one of the seldom butscientifically acknowledged spontaneous resolutions for thistype of cancer. In all other cases, conventional therapy wasadministered and one patient died. In 1990, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in the USA initiated an expert panel to scrutinize case reports eitherselected by the proponents of the therapy or published inGerson's book (13). None of these examinations found aproof of the efficacy of the diet (19). Gonzalez regimen. The diet is similar to that of the Gerson regimen. Gonzalez and Isaacs reported on 11 patients in 1999,nine (81%) survived one year, five (45%) survived two years,and four survived three years (21). In a controlled trial, patientswith advanced pancreatic cancer were allowed to choosetreatment with either gemcitabine or pancreatic enzymes. Theenzyme treatment included orally-ingested proteolyticenzymes, nutritional supplements, de-toxification, and anorganic diet. The median survival in the experimental groupwas 4.3 months, in the control group 14 months. The qualityof life ratings were significantly better in the chemotherapygroup compared to the enzyme-treated group (22).Huebner et al: Counseling on Cancer Diets (Review) 41 Figure 1.

Different forms of this diet exist, some with a moderate reduction ofcarbohydrates some with a reduction to about 10% of totalenergy intake with the aim of inducing ketosis. Schmidt et al.(23) published a pilot study on 16 patients with advanced cancer, on a diet with a maximum of 70 g carbohydrates perday, for an intended eight weeks. Two patients died, three didnot accept the diet and three had progressive disease. Qualityof life was assessed in five patients who finished the study.Emotional function and sleep quality was better while otherparameters remained stable or deteriorated. The authorsargue that this was due to the advanced stage of their cancer.Side-effects of the diet were fatigue and constipation. ANTICANCER RESEARCH 34: 39-48 (2014) 44Table III.

A casereport of two children with brain tumors on a ketogenic dietdescribes a reduction of glucose uptake in PET-CT. One girlsurvived for several months without progression (25). In an older study, a ketogenic diet with high amounts of omega-3-fatty acids was fed enterally to patients withcachexia from cancer. The authors did not describe a positiveeffect on cachexia or on the course of disease (26). Pre-clinical data are ambiguous. Some show a reduction of tumor. Yet some in vitro as in vivo experiments, gave warnings as to the safety of this diet. In vitro data showed that cancer cells not only adapt to the situation but developmutations and characteristics of stem cells. One hypothesis is that the diet puts the tumor under stress and thus selects forresistance and malignancy. In an experiment on mice, thetumors in the diet-treated group initially grew less but latertumor growth accelerated and exceeded that of the controlgroup (28, 29, 30, 31). Other experiments show that a reduction of tumor growth is seen if the animals lose weight - independent from thekind of diet (32). Macrobiotic diet. The macrobiotic was created by two Japanese scientists, Oshawa and Kushi, who endeavored tocreate a whole system of living which should promote health,peace and happiness in the world. The original diet wascombined with other changes in lifestyle and intended as aHuebner et al: Counseling on Cancer Diets (Review) 45Table IV . Recommendations for counseling patients on cancer diets. 1 All cancer patients should be offered advice on healthy nutrition and cancer diets. If needed, specialists should help the pat ient to ensure sufficient intake of macro- and micronutrients. (Adaptation from the ethical discussion of Gilmour et al. (42)). 2 Counseling on cancer diets should be available at a low threshold. That means, it should be part of the communication between oncologist and patient or the oncologist should transfer the patient to a specialist who is working in close contact with the tumor center. 3 Qualification: Caregivers giving advice on cancer diets should have knowledge on and experience in nutrition and oncology. Fur thermore, they should know details of cancer diets and the strategies with which they are propagated. They must be trained in communicati on skills. These qualifications should be acquired and regularly updated. 4 Before starting a consultation, the consultant should know about the patient's disease and former and planned therapy. A histo ry of nutrition before disease became apparent should be taken. The patient's (and family's) attitude towards eating is also important. 5 Eating is a social process. Family members often feel responsible for preparing meals and ensuring nutrition. Therefore, membe rs of the family and close friends should be welcomed to the consultation. 6 The individual's history of weight and nutrition since cancer diagnosis should be considered. Furthermore, it is crucial to un derstand patient's actual attitude, his needs and his objections concering the process of eating. Eating has highly emotional aspects and the cons ultant should try to understand the point of view of the patient. Attitudes of family members and friends are also of interest. It is important t o know patient's beliefs concerning diets and their influence on cancer. If they are interested in or adhere to a cancer diet, their expectation s and his experiences should be asked for. 7 Lack of knowledge or misconceptions should be pointed out and the scientific evidence explained. If the patient has a misunder standing of the situation of their disease, it may be helpful to explain this first and then advance to talking about nutrition and diets. If i t is not the oncologist, who is doing the consultation, it may be useful to refer the patient to them, if misconceptions on the disease persist. Communication with respect means that individual beliefs of the patient should be acknowledged but divergent concepts between t he patient's point of view and the medical point of view should be named. 8 A list of items and questions to discuss should be agreed. All cancer diets the patient wants to discuss should be described f rom a scientific point of view but using lay vocabulary. Besides pointing out lack of evidence, fallacies in the underlying cancer theories must be addressed and adverse effects such as malnutrition must be discussed. In order not to leave the patient discouraged, an individual concep t of healthy nutrition should be provided. 9 Counseling should be adapted to the patient's needs and resources. It may be helpful to refer to cultural specifics.10 Counseling on cancer diets should always has to be done in the context of the cancer treatment and should consider treatment aims and aspects of psycho-oncology and palliative care if appropriate. 11 If a more complex problem with eating ( e.g.loss of weight, malnutrition) exists, the patient must be offered further support. 12 In any consultation it should be regarded whether the patient and/or his family need psychological support. In this case the patient/family should be referred to a psycho-oncologist. 13 The most important points discussed should be put down in a letter to the patient. If appropriate a list of recommendations o n nutrition should be included. This letter must be written in a language which lay persons can understand. 14 Follow-up of the patient should be offered.15 If the patient adheres to a cancer diet despite counseling against it, follow-up is of great importance in order to detect ad verse events early and to be able to discuss the diet again. Besides measuring weight, malnutrition can be detected by taking blood levels of micronut rients, or measuring muscle mass or albumin in order to assess protein deficiency. If deficits become obvious, the patient should be infor med of the consequences and strongly advised against continuing the diet. In the case of their further adhering to the diet prescription o f supplements must be discussed even if they are no adequate substitute.cancer cure, which might not be achieved by surgery or chemo- or radiotherapy. In the scientific literature there isone retrospective report of 23 patients with pancreatic cancer.The overall survival was 13 months - a comparison with theSurveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program(SEER) data discloses an overall survival of only threemonths. Only patients who adhered to the diet for at leastthree months were included (34). The procedure suggests amajor bias, as patients on the diet who died early may havebeen excluded. Six case reports were published within a Health technology Assessment report on unconventional therapiesof the US congress. Experts did not find a proof of a positiveimpact of the diet in any case (35). Vegan diet. In a randomized study of 93 patients with prostate cancer, Ornish and colleagues (40) tested a complex lifestyleintervention including a vegan diet with approximately 10% ofcalories from fat. supplemented with soy, fish oil (3 mg daily),vitamin C, E, and selenium. Additionally, moderate aerobicexercise (30 min daily), and stress management techniques (60min daily) were advised. Participants in the experimental grouphad a significant decline in prostate specific antigen whereasthose in the control group had an increase. Due to thecomplexity of the intervention, it is impossible to separate theeffect of the vegan diet from the other components.Evidence on Counseling Cancer Patients on CAM Schofield and colleagues (9) have summed-up the existingevidence on counseling cancer patients on CAM in 10recommendations (Table III). Updating their review, we found 59 articles using the same search strategy in Medline. These articles were publishedbetween January 2008 and July 2012. We assessed allarticles with regard to new clinical data on the process ofgiving to cancer patients advice on CAM. No publicationprovided new data on the communication of doctors andpatients concerning CAM. Salamonsen (41) reported that \"negative communication experiences resulted in the decision to use CAM, and insome cases to decline conventional therapy; positivecommunication experiences led to the decision to use CAMas a supplement, not as an alternative to conventionaltherapy. Gilmour and colleagues (42) examined the topic from an ethical point of view. In their opinion, providing informationon CAM is a physician's duty. \"The legal and ethicalobligation to obtain informed consent to treatment requiresdisclosure and discussion of therapies when there is reliableevidence of potential therapeutic benefit.\" The questionregarding CAM is whether there is enough evidence tosupport this obligation.

(9) we discussed if these recommendations are appropriate in thesetting of cancer diets. As cancer diets have the characteristicstypical of CAM - namely little or lack of evidence fromclinical studies, concepts of cancer origin not in line withscientific results but conforming with lay etiology, offeringmeans to patients to be active by themselves and promisingcure even in case of advanced cancer - all 10 steps can beapplied to the process of discussing cancer diets. We used these evidence-based recommendations to develop more detailed rules for the whole process of discussing cancerdiets with patients. We also took into account therecommendations of a group of us (Huebner, Micke, Muecke,Muenstedt) already published. A list of 14 recommendations wasmade and agreed upon in a Delphi process (Figure 1; Table IV). Discussion In summary, we did not identify clinical evidence on level 1or 2 for any of the described diets. One randomized study,including a vegan diet, has been published (40). Due to thecomplexity of the intervention (including supplements andmajor lifestyle changes) no conclusion on the effects of thementioned diets is possible to date. Some diets are based on hypotheses of carcinogenesis which are not compatible with modern scientific concepts suchas the Breuss cure or the Moermann or Livingston regimen.In order to give advice to patients a benefit risk assessment ismandatory. From this, different categories of diet arise: thosewith possible benefits and no risks; possible benefits withpotential harm; no benefit and no harm, no benefit andpotential harm. In Table V we summarize the diets discussed.Diets for which no clinical benefit has been shown, but whichmay entail risks should not be recommended. For those dietswith no proven benefit which are based on hypotheses in linewith scientific concepts of carcinogenesis, clinical studies needto be initiated. Risks reported from case reports or derivedfrom considering the consequences of the diet ( e.g.risk of weight loss or deficits in micronutrients) must be taken intoaccount while planning these studies. In order to provide asmuch patient safety as possible, we propose only consideringclinical data from controlled studies for benefit, but also totake into account case reports and pre-clinical studies for riskassessment ( e.g. data on interactions with enzymatic metabolism). One major concern with any cancer diet is that patients may rely only on these diets and delay or omit cancertreatments. This may entail relapse or progress of diseaseand suffering from cancer-related symptoms. Therefore,guidance of patients is of high importance.For most of the diets discussed, the situation is similar to that for CAM treatments. Patients who are searching forhope and cure turn to these methods. The main goals are totreat the cancer directly, reduce side-effects, boost theimmune system and to be active themselves (1, 43, 44).These needs are met by methods which are based onconcepts of carcinogenesis, are easy to understand forpatients and enable them to use CAM treatments. Thisphenomenon is true for all the cancer diets analyzed here. Asthese diets are in line with lay etiological concepts, they arehighly attractive to patients. Counseling patients on these diets should take psychological facts and their consequences into account.Merely providing evidence will not be sufficient. Followingour recommendations, the physician may take the patientspoint of view into account and show his respect for the desireto contribute to their treatment. Thus, the likelihood ofachieving consent by shared decision-making increases. Ourrecommendations contain elements of appreciation andmutual acceptance that will allow for further contact betweenthe physician and the patient even in cases of disagreement.In this case, efforts must be undertaken to discover adverseevents, while the patient adheres to a cancer diet early infollow-up, in order to prevent serious harm.
