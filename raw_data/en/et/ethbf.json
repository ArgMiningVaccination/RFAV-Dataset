In this week's eSkeptic, we present on article from the archives of [Skeptic magazine issue 5.1](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/5.1/), from 1997 wherein professional magician Jamy Ian Swiss discusses critical thinking as a way of protecting ourselves from the threat of deception. Jamy Ian Swiss professional magician, a co-founder of the [National Capital Area Skeptics](http://ncas.org/); a co-founder of the [New York City Skeptics](http://nycs.org/); has spoken and performed across the U.S. on behalf of the Center For Inquiry; has been a contributor to Skeptic magazine; is a co-producer and on-stage host of the [Northeast Conference on Science & Skepticism](http://necss.org/); has presented or performed annually at James Randi's \"The Amazing Meeting\" since its inception in 2003; and is a past Senior Fellow of the [James Randi Educational Foundation](http://randi.org/) for which he has served as a blogger, creator of the Honest Liar video commentaries, and continues to help administer the foundation's Million Dollar Challenge. The Limits of Critical Thinking by Jamy Ian Swiss The recent self-inflicted deaths of 39 members of the Heaven's Gate cult raises challenging questions for skeptics. We are tempted to point in horror and issue our own doomsday admonitions: \"Warning! Danger! These are the hazards of belief in UFOs and other goofy stuff! Beware! Lack of critical thinking skills equals madness equals death!\" If only these particular victims had read Randi's [Flim-Flam!](http://amzn.com/0879751983?tag=skepticcom20-20), they might be living, productive members of society today. Or maybe not. My experience with deception has proven to me that the human brain is evolutionarily programmed to be readily manipulated, whether by the likes of itinerant conjurors like myself and James Randi or by virulent megalomaniacs like Marshall Herff Applewhite. The human tendency to organize information even where no useful information exists appears to be hardwired into our brains. It was there for the first aboriginal rain dance, and it's here today for the most contemporary forms of magical thinking. That tendency to organize, to look ahead and be creative and surmise from thin evidence is a distinctly human trait, as responsible for the greatness of the human condition as it is for its follies and failings. Our human \"big brain\" is an accident of evolution that may well be our salvation or undoing as a species, with its abilities to invent, create, explore and imagine, or to become addicted, depressed, or believe incredibly dangerous ideas in the face of all evidence to the contrary. When we see the apparently placid willingness of the Higher Source cult members to fulfill their grisly task of self-destruction, it is difficult to view them as victims. Considering the patently ludicrous ideas the cult based its belief system on, it's tempting to write the followers off as cranks who were victims only of their own willful stupidity. But the phenomenon of cultism is characterized by distinctly manipulative practices of recruitment and maintenance that must be considered independently of the particular belief system they happen to be promoting. Toxicly effective cult leaders like Herff Applewhite will always produce followers who swear to their willing allegiance and free choice just as the observer of a magic trick will swear he never looked away the whole time the magician's spoon was magically bending. Both victims are certain they had all the information necessary to make a capable judgment. The issue of psychological manipulation is a graduated continuum, from the person fooled by the spoon-bender to the cult victim controlled to the point of suicide. But if the cult member is a victim of a psychological predator, what about those in the free marketplace of ideas who elect to repudiate conventional medicine and sign on with a homeopathic practitioner? The wiring flaws of the human brain notwithstanding, isn't the homeopathy user a victim of willful ignorance? Such individuals have to be given full responsibility for their lives to muck about with as they wish. We are overwhelmed by such examples of \"epistemological hedonism,\" i.e., if it feels good, believe it. Education doesn't protect those who believe irrespective of facts and information. Those who become hostile and defensive the moment we question, for example, the concept of astrology do so because such questions challenge their entire view of world and self, not simply\u2014as skeptics are inclined to consider it\u2014the specific facts concerning a narrow subject matter, easily disproved. As skeptical educators we must do more than simply provide cautionary signposts detailing a shopping list of road hazards labeled astrology, ufology, and a host of other pseudologies. We recognize that we must encourage broad-based thinking skills to help inoculate people against malicious crackpottery. That training must begin early in life, because it is the rare adult who comes to recognize the logical flaws in their own longstanding belief system. Our task is to teach the young\u2014along with anyone else who will listen\u2014to think for themselves, so that they can use these skills throughout their lives. Rational inquiry isn't merely an academic exercise or a chore that protects us from danger. Critical thinking enhances individual responsibility by liberating us to assess risk and embrace informed choice and thereby more fully savor the human experience. Unfortunately, thinking will never be foolproof protection against the threats of deception; fools can be very determined, as can the inclination to be fooled. Thinking is merely our best chance.

Where in the world did this strange idea come from? In this week's eSkeptic, Pat Linse examines the surprising origins of cow tipping. This article was originally published in [Skeptic magazine 20.1](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/20.1/) (2015). Pat Linse is an award winning illustrator who specialized in film industry art before becoming one of the founders of the Skeptics Society, Skeptic magazine, and the creator of Junior Skeptic magazine. As Skeptic magazine's Art Director, she has created many illustrations for both Skeptic and Junior Skeptic. She is co-editor of the [The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b082HB). The Legend of the Falling Beast Cow Tipping's Surprising Origins by Pat Linse Istarted to hear the story as soon as I moved to Los Angeles in the 1970s: \"Have you ever gone cow tipping?\" the twenty-something guy would brag. \"It's hilarious! You drive out into the country late at night and find a bunch of sleeping cows\u2014they sleep standing up with their legs locked, you know\u2014and wham!\u2014you shove them over before they know what's happened. Boy, are they surprised!\" Of course cow tipping is an urban legend as explained in the article above, from from Junior Skeptic # 5, bound within [Skeptic magazine issue 7.2](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/7.2/) (pages 100-101). Cows don't sleep standing up, their legs do not lock, and they are generally too big for a puny human to topple. They don't even sleep at night, resting instead in five minute naps thoughout the 24-hour day. One of the oddest parts of the cow tipping story is the claim that a cow sleeps standing up \"on locked legs\" that are so ridged and unbending that it can be easily pushed over. Where in the world did this strange idea come from? It turns out that the story comes from Europe and it's been around for at least 2000 years. The famous Roman general Julius Caesar recorded this fantastic account of how to hunt easy-to-tip animals that lived in the dense forests that covered what is now southern Germany: There are also (animals) which are called elks [The animal known as a moose in America is called an elk in Europe]. The shape of these, and the varied color of their skins, is much like roes [deer], but in size they surpass them a little and are destitute of horns, and have legs without joints and ligatures; nor do they lie down for the purpose of rest, nor, if they have been thrown down by any accident, can they raise or lift themselves up. Trees serve as beds to them; they lean themselves against them, and thus reclining only slightly, they take their rest; when the huntsmen have discovered from the footsteps of these animals whither they are accustomed to betake themselves, they either undermine all the trees at the roots, or cut into them so far that the upper part of the trees may appear to be left standing. When they have leant upon them, according to their habit, they knock down by their weight the unsupported trees, and fall down themselves along with them. Ceasar's Gallic Wars\u2014Book 6, Chapter 27 [6.27] about 58-51 BCE This same hunting tall tale was also told in ancient times about the elephant and the asian tapir. About 100 years after Caesar another Roman, Pliny the Elder, wrote about an animal with a long nose he called an \"achlis,\" that seemed to have both moose and elephant traits: The North, too, produces herds of wild horses, as Africa and Asia do of wild asses. There is also the achlis, which is produced in the island of Scandinavia; it is not unlike the elk, but has no joints in the hind leg. Hence, it never lies down, but reclines against a tree while it sleeps; it can only be taken by previously cutting into the tree, and thus laying a trap for it, as otherwise, it would escape through its swiftness. Its upper lip is so extremely large, for which reason it is obliged to go backwards when grazing; otherwise, by moving onwards, the lip would get doubled up. Pliny the Elder's Natural History, 77 CE. The story that an elk could be easily captured because it couldn't get back up after it fell to the ground was passed down through the centuries as part of medical folklore. Books listing medical herbs and magical cures declared that elk suffered from \"the falling disease\" which we know today as epilepsy. Legend had it that an elk could cure its own epilepsy by striking itself with its hoof, so it was thought that taking powered elk's hoof as a medicine, or wearing a ring carved from elk's hoof on your finger, or even wearing a gold pendant set with a scrap of hoof would ward off the disease. The story that European elk were susceptible to fits of falling made it across the Atlantic to the Americas. As late as the mid-1800s the famous author and medical doctor Oliver Wendal Holmes complained that some superstitious American physicians still prescribed elk's hoof (or even horse's hooves) for epilepsy. Did the old falling elk legend inspire the modern cow tipping story? Both are a bragging tale where a large animal is captured at night because of its unusual sleeping habits, but that in itself might not be enough to say the stories are related. But both stories depend on the same ridiculous idea\u2014that the animals suffer from a weakness that makes them easy prey\u2014that they are easily toppled because of their stiff, unbending legs. Simple observation should have quickly killed this belief off. Just by spending a few minutes watching elk, moose, or cattle, anyone can see that they bend their legs, lay down to rest or sleep, and that they can easily get up again. Did the same mistaken belief\u2014easily corrected by observation\u2014 arise twice, and was it twice perserved by being applied to two identical hunting tall tales? More likely the older story influenced the newer one in which urban tale tellers replaced the elk or moose with a more familiar animal.

We call this the most urban (city-like) of all Urban Legends because it's a story believed by city folk, although farm people have been known to tell it as a tall tale. Anyone who has ever worked closely with cows knows that almost every statement in the cow tipping story is false (as we will explain below). But you will probably find that you don't have to ask very many people to find someone who absolutely swears they tipped cows over exactly the way it's described in the cartoon above. Why People Who Know About Cows Think That the Cow Tipping Story is Largely an Urban Legend Cartoon panel 1 (top of this article): There is no such thing as a cow \"locking its legs.\" They don't have to because cows sleep lying down (people may be confusing them with horses which do sleep standing up).

About this week's eSkeptic Have you ever questioned your faith, or worried about what life would be like without it, or do you know someone who has? Have you ever wrestled with issues of how to replace religious practices and ideas with secular ones? In this week's eSkeptic, Donald Prothero reviews [Living the Secular Life: New Answers to Old Questions](http://amzn.com/1594205086?tag=skepticcom20-20): a book by Phil Zuckerman that addresses these topics. Dr. Donald R. Prothero earned MA, M.Phil, and PhD degrees in geological sciences from Columbia University, and a BA in geology and biology from the University of California, Riverside. He is currently the author, co-author, editor, or co-editor of 32 books and over 250 scientific papers, including five leading geology textbooks and five trade books as well as edited symposium volumes and other technical works. He is on the editorial board of Skeptic magazine, and in the past has served as an associate or technical editor for Geology, Paleobiology and Journal of Paleontology. He was Professor of Geology at Occidental College in Los Angeles, and Lecturer in Geobiology at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. He has also been featured on several television documentaries, including episodes of Paleoworld (BBC), Prehistoric Monsters Revealed (History Channel), Entelodon and Hyaenodon (National Geographic Channel) and Walking with Prehistoric Beasts (BBC). The Times, They are a Changin' by Donald R. Prothero Last month, a [new Pew survey](https://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/) was released that showed that the \"nones\" or \"religiously unaffiliated\" in America have become the second largest religious group in America (22.8% of the surveyed population, jumping up from only 16% in 2007). They were outnumbered only slightly by Evangelical Protestants at 25.8%. \"Nones\" even are more numerous than Catholics, and the numbers of mainstream Protestants is plummeting. \"Nones\" are ten time more numerous than Jews, Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus, and other faiths (most are only 2-3% or less). Not only are the numbers of \"nones\" increasing rapidly, but nearly every religious group in America is declining just as fast, including a 0.9% drop even in the dominant Evangelicals. More importantly, the largest percentage increase in unaffiliated people is among the younger generations, especially the Millennials (those born between 1981-2000), who are becoming increasingly non-religious (36-44% or higher). Even more striking, the usual trends of people getting more conservative and religious as they age is not holding true with the Millennials, since the older Millennials show just as high a rate of lack of religiosity as do younger ones. If this is true, then religion may be on a permanent downward trend in this country, just as has already occurred in largely secular countries of the developed world in Europe and Asia. Naturally, the blowhards in the right-wing political/religious community bemoaned this news, although it has been [developing for a long time](http://www.myarklamiss.com/story/d/story/decline-in-us-christianity-mirrors-larger-trends/18270/iMJ-TJhNkkOO0m1bstpTHg) and is really not news to those of us who have been paying attention. Bill O'Reilly of Fox News [blamed it on rap music](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/bill-o-reilly-christianity-rap-music). Former Pennsylvania Senator and two-time presidential candidate Rick Santorum [blamed it on the lack of anti-abortion zealots running for president](http://www.rawstory.com/2015/05/rick-santorum-blames-christianitys-decline-on-lack-of-anti-abortion-zealots-running-for-president/). Rush Limbaugh (who is losing channels and sponsorships right and left) [blamed it on gay marriage](http://www.politicususa.com/2015/05/13/limbaugh-wrong-gay-activists-kill-christianity-christianity.html). Pat Buchanan [blamed it on the Supreme Court](http://townhall.com/columnists/patbuchanan/2015/05/26/the-decline-of-christian-america-n2003650/page/full), the liberal elites in the media, and the counterculture of the 1960s (even though the Boomers are mostly religious). Ken Ham of the Creation Museum and Answers in Genesis Ministry, [blamed it on the public schools as \"churches of atheism\"](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2015/05/15/ken-ham-is-worried-about-losing-young-people-to-churches-of-atheism-a-k-a-public-schools/) and the lack of early indoctrination of children. Similar responses could be heard from Pat Robertson and other evangelical ministers. As a number of people have pointed out, however, these simplistic cartoon villains of religion need to be replaced with more realistic causes, backed up the poll numbers and demographic trends. The Pew Foundation is set to release another report soon on their analysis of the reasons, but already scholars have pointed to several plausible causes. Professor of Secular Studies Phil Zuckerman of Pitzer College in Claremont, California, has written several books on the religious changes in the United States ( [Faith No More](http://amzn.com/019024884X?tag=skepticcom20-20), [Society without God](http://amzn.com/0814797237?tag=skepticcom20-20)). He just released his newest book on the topic, called [Living the Secular Life: New Answers to Old Questions](http://amzn.com/1594205086?tag=skepticcom20-20). Zuckerman and most of the analysts point to several trends that have probably contributed (although it's hard to decide which ones are most important): - The ascendancy of the extreme fundamentalists/evangelicals, and their grip on the GOP, has meant that the ugliest, meanest, most anti-science, most intolerant side of Christianity\u2014anti-abortion, homophobic, racist, sexually repressed and woman-hating, and hating anyone different from them\u2014has become the public face of Christianity. In states where they have enacted their hard-right agenda, the polls show a huge backlash from Millennials and young people who are much more tolerant of gays, other races, and much more pro-science and feminist in orientation. These young people have not switched to more liberal Christian denominations, but left religion altogether. It appears unlikely that they will come back to religion any time soon after they have formed their opinions of Christianity from their younger years. Harvard Professor [Robert Putnam wrote](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/our-humanity-naturally/201505/why-are-christian-numbers-dropping): \"These were the kids who were coming of age in the America of the culture wars, in the America in which religion publicly became associated with a particular brand of politics, and so I think the single most important reason for the rise of the unknowns is that combination of the younger people moving to the left on social issues and the most visible religious leaders moving to the right on that same issue.\" - A second factor may be another thing creating a black eye for religion, especially among the young: the acts of religious leaders and fanatics. These range from radical Islam and its terrorist tactics and barbaric treatment of people (especially women), to pedophile priests (probably the single biggest reason Catholicism is declining), to the hypocritical ministers with feet of clay who scold others about their morality, then turn out to be closeted gays, or child molesters, or adulterers, or criminals. - Zuckerman pointed to a third important factor: the rise of the internet. Just a generation ago, if you had religious doubts but lived in small-town America, you had no one to talk to. Everyone's first question after they meet you is \"What church do you go to?\" You had to keep your ideas to yourself and stay in the closet. Now, thanks to the Internet, you can connect with virtual communities of secularists all over the globe. There are many different secularist meetings where you are among like-minded individuals who also reject religion. In this day of instant information, any bizarre claim by religion can be instantly Googled. In many cases, the sites debunking religious claims will be in the top few hits (e.g, Scientology). In my day, it took me a long time to find a few books on atheism (such as Bertrand Russell's [Why I Am Not A Christian](http://amzn.com/0671203231?tag=skepticcom20-20)) in the library (if the library dared order such a title). Now, the entire debunking of religious claims is just a few clicks away, and books by Dawkins, Dennett, Harris, and Hitchens are best sellers. Anyone with just a bit of curiosity or doubt, especially among the younger generations, can find things in just a few seconds that I never encountered in years of reading and searching when I was young and questioning my family's Presbyterian faith. - Another surprising factor that Zuckerman discovered: the rise of women in the work force, and the profound changes it has meant in all of American society. Women tend to be the religious backbone of most families (my mother sure was!). In conservative religious families, they are the enforcers and the teachers of the faith to their children. But changing economic and demographic factors has led women out of their traditional roles, exposed them to new ideas, and made them less likely to rely on religion when being homemaker isn't their only job. The main focus of [Living the Secular Life](http://amzn.com/1594205086?tag=skepticcom20-20), however, is a follow-up to Zuckerman's earlier books about secularism\u2014how do American secularists live? In each chapter, he deals with an important personal or cultural issue that is usually defined in religious terms, and shows how American secularists do just fine without religion. These include the common questions, \"How can you be moral without God\"? (actually, secularists tend to be more moral than religious people). How do you raise kids without church? Where do you go for community without your church group? How do you deal with life's difficulties and with death without the hope of religious faith? In each chapter, Zuckerman approaches the problem by giving examples of real people and how they address these issues, then shows that religion is not required to deal with any of these issues\u2014just as the vast majority of secular people in most of the northern European countries have long ago concluded. Zuckerman's book is an excellent read for anyone who is questioning their faith and worried about what life would be like without it, or for secularists who are wrestling with issues of how to replace religious practices and ideas with secular ones. When Zuckerman [gave a talk about his book](https://www.skeptic.com/lectures/living-the-secular-life/) for the Skeptics Society at Caltech on April 19, 2015, he told a story about how much life has changed in northern Europe. In most cities, huge cathedrals and other religious buildings no longer have any congregations, but have been sold and are now used as meeting houses, public places, and even local pubs and taverns. They have become cathedrals of secularism. I'm not expecting this to happen in the U.S. next week, but it can happen very fast. The change occurred in Europe over only two generations, mostly before the internet gave it any help\u2014thanks to cradle-to-grave social safety nets provided by their governments, which remove the fear that drives religious belief. In Quebec in the 1960s, the Catholic hierarchy once ruled the entire province, but a series of elections of secular governments led it to become the most progressive and least religious province in all of Canada in a single generation. John Lennon imagined no religion. Now the rest of the country is catching up.

Click an image to enlarge it. On Saturday during the breaks and meals skeptics had lots of time and opportunity to interact with the speakers, get their books signed, and photographs taken. Some people might have even noticed the mega movie star Johnny Depp and his wife the actress Amber Heard in attendance, as both are official card-carrying (and [Skeptic pin](http://bit.ly/1NfA4I4) bearing) Skeptics who thoroughly enjoyed the talks and meeting the speakers back stage in the Green Room. The highlight of the day was the evening rock concert in Caltech's Beckman Auditorium featuring the Las Vegas headliner Frankie Moreno and his band, featuring his brother Tony Moreno on bass, Mathew Belote on drums, and Alex Zeilon on guitar (about whom Frankie joked they hired for his Justin Bieber haircut). It was a rockin' good time (Frankie even talked Michael Shermer into coming on stage to sing Mac the Knife with him\u2014also included in the show below\u2014American Idol ready he is not, but a good sport he is). The band played a number of Frankie's original hit songs, along with the surprise hit cover of Eleanor Rigby, as you've never heard it. By the end of the evening Frankie had much of the audience on stage dancing and rockin' out and having a grand ol' time. On Sunday the Skeptics Society hosted two science field trips, a Geo Tour to the San Andreas Fault and other unique geological features of the Southern California landscape that makes the San Gabriel mountains the fastest growing mountain range in the continental United States. Skeptics also trekked up the San Gabriel mountains to Mt. Wilson to visit the observatory telescopes, which were in their day the largest on the planet, including the 60-inch telescope that was involved in important work in locating our solar system within the Milky Way Galaxy, the 100-inch telescope that Hubble used to discover the expanding universe, and the solar observatory from which hand-drawn illustrations of the sun and its spots have been made daily for a century. Finally, a fund-raising dinner featuring Richard Dawkins, held at the Shermer home in Altadena, includes an impromptu close-up magic show by Jamy Ian Swiss. At the end Dawkins declared \"Jamy is the best conjurer I've this week's eSkeptic, William M. London reviews the [Skeptics Society Conference on the Future of Science and Humanity](https://www.skeptic.com/lectures/conferences/in-the-year-2525/) that took place at Caltech May 29-31, 2015. William M. London is a professor of public health at California State University, Los Angeles who specializes in the study of consumer health issues. He is tied for the record of most degrees (five) from the University at Buffalo (SUNY): BA in biological science; BA in geography; EdM in educational psychology; EdM in health education; and EdD. in health education. His Master of Public Health degree is from Loma Linda University. He completed all coursework toward a Master of Science in Clinical Research from Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science. The Year 2525 Ain't What It Used to Be by William M. London When I saw the lineup of world-class speakers for the Skeptics Society's conference \" [In the Year 2525: Big Science, Big History, and the Far Future of Humanity](https://www.skeptic.com/lectures/conferences/in-the-year-2525/) (May 29-31, 2015) \" at Caltech's Beckman Auditorium, I realized I had to be there, starting with the speakers' reception and buffet dinner at The Westin Hotel in Pasadena featuring close-up magic performed by [Jack Velour](http://www.jackvelour.com/) and after-dinner stage magic performed by [Jamy Ian Swiss](http://honestliar.com/). The opening talk of the conference by prominent paleontologist, geoscience researcher, and science educator [Donald Prothero](http://www.donaldprothero.com/) suggested horrible living conditions ahead if we continue on our present course. Prothero was like the ghost of Jacob Marley coming to haunt Ebeneezer Scrooge with three more ghosts: (1) mass extinctions, (2) global warming, and (3) depletion of limited mineral resources. These ghosts are no phantoms. There have been five major mass extinctions of species on our planet, and now we're in the era of a sixth extinction that is a thousand times greater. He cited the book [The Sixth Extinction](http://amzn.com/1250062187?tag=skepticcom20-20) by Elizabeth Kolber, which won the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction. (As if, I didn't already have enough books on my reading to-do list!) Prothero used the analogy of rivets popping out of an airplane wing to species dying off. The problem isn't catastrophic right away, but when enough rivets pop out, the wing falls off. In other words, when enough species die off, ecosystems collapse. As well, he said we're headed for a global increase in temperature of four degrees Celsius by the end of the century and that holding down the increase to just two degrees would be an enormous challenge. He described the problem of increasing tropical disease with the spread of insects accompanying warming climate. He said sea level has risen eight inches since 1900 and showed maps projecting how much of coastal areas around the world will be underwater if the melting of glaciers and ice caps continue unabated. Prothero then moved on to the problem of finite mineral resources. For example, he noted that rare earth elements are available mainly from China. He presented Hubbert's famous bell-shaped curve illustrating production rates of natural resources over time and said that we are already at the end of the oil age since it has become more and more difficult to maintain oil supplies to meet energy demands. He concluded his talk by emphasizing the need for green energy supplies and by pointing out how overpopulation contributes to the catastrophic problems he described. The last question Scrooge asked the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come was: \"Are these the shadows of the things that Will be, or are they shadows of things that May be, only?\" I thought of this as Prothero considered how much human progress has come and may continue to come at the expense of other species and the future habitability of our planet. I'm an optimist, but Prothero convinced me that we need to carefully study the sustainability of human progress. And that entails consideration of the likelihood of various calamitous scenarios along with the feasibility and potential positive and negative impacts of various solutions to the problems Prothero described. [Ian Morris](http://www.ianmorris.org/), the Jean and Rebecca Willard Professor of Classics and Professor of History at Stanford University and a Fellow of the Stanford Archaeology Center, was next on the program. He spoke about his new book [Foragers, Farmers, and Fossil Fuels: How Human Values Evolve](http://amzn.com/0691160392?tag=skepticcom20-20), which focuses on how the source of energy a society relies on influences its cultural evolution that, in turn, impacts upon human values such as what is viewed as just and fair. For example, Morris noted that hunter-gatherer tribes value political, economic, and gender equality. Hierarchies don't work in such small societies. Violence is a common response to disruptive upstarts. By contrast, farming societies are larger and more complicated, requiring a division of labor. Thus, they are hierarchical with significant gender inequality. He characterized the violence in these hierarchical as state-sanctioned. Finally, Morris described fossil-fuel societies as having enormous populations, technology, and an extensive division of labor. Ordinary people are empowered through democracy and open society arrangements thrive. Keeping with the futuristic theme of the conference, Morris raised questions about networked post-fossil-fuel societies: - What will fairness look like when brain-to-brain interfacing is common? - What will political, economic, and gender hierarchies look like? He mentioned two possible scenarios: - A souped-up fossil fuel society that would be hierarchically flatter with increased egalitarianism. - A society of some superhuman people with significant hierarchy. Care to speculate about which scenario would be more successful in averting the catastrophes that Donald Prothero described? The next speaker, [Jared Diamond](http://www.jareddiamond.org/), Professor of Geography at UCLA, shared insights related to his field experiences in New Guinea. He began by discussing how people judge and misjudge dangers (an issue I emphasize as a consumer health specialist and healthy skepticism advocate). He noted that while hazards of the natural environment, violence, and infectious disease are greater problems in New Guinea than in the U.S., chronic disease hazards are greater here. Also, Americans have more remedies for hazards (such as orthopedic care to set broken bones). However, Americans tend to obsess about or overrate the wrong risks, such as terrorism, plane crashes, and nuclear accidents. Hazards tend to be perceived as more risky when they're unfamiliar and seen as beyond our control. In contrast, Diamond said we need to recognize bigger threats that are more familiar and within our control, like slipping and falling in showers, falling off stepladders, and tumbling down stairs. At age 77, Diamond said he has a life expectancy of 15 years. He quipped that with a 1 in 1000 risk of a fatal fall in a shower, he can expect to kill himself five times in his expected life. Thus, he advocated for what he called \"constructive paranoia.\" He summarized what we can learn from New Guineans regarding: Bringing up children. In New Guinea, there are no helicopter parents and they don't spank. Children have choices and responsibilities, and they develop social skills to bargain. Diamond said he modeled this parenting style in raising his own twin boys. Staying healthy. Diamond claimed that there is no diabetes and heart disease among New Guineans, not because they die too young to develop these diseases but due to their vigorous physical activity and high-fiber diets that are low in salt and sugar. While a [report from 1966](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5918354?dopt=abstract) backs Diamond's claim, I note that [diabetes](http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/26/3/955.2.full) and [heart disease](http://www.who.int/chp/chronic_disease_report/papua.pdf) have become increasingly prevalent in New Guinea as they adopt Western diets. Alzheimer's disease attenuation. Diamond said that bilingualism and multilingualism provides some protection against Alzheimer's disease by working out the brain. I note that the Mayo Clinic says the [evidence isn't clear](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/expert-answers/benefits-of-being-bilingual/faq-20058048) that speaking more than one language prevents Alzheimer's disease. And working out the brain, at least through games developed by the brain training industry, has [not been established as protection against Alzheimer's disease development](http://www.ncahf.org/digest15/15-10.html). Next up was the inimitable social psychologist [Carol Tavris](http://tavris.socialpsychology.org/), who began her talk with a clever joke and what I would call constructive silliness. She suggested that in 500 years, there would be a female Pope, but no God, and a white guy would be invited to speak on gender. Tavris noted that 25 years ago efforts to predict the future of how gender would be talked about didn't predict gay marriage, the transgender movement, the concept of metrosexuals, a black president, and Sarah Palin, along with female leaders in Ireland and Turkey (not to mention Germany, whose Chancellor is not only female but holds a Ph.D. in quantum chemistry!). Nevertheless, Tavris offered a few extrapolations of current trends: - Technology transformation of human nature (e.g., artificial intelligence, [optogenetics](http://web.stanford.edu/group/dlab/optogenetics/), DNA alteration). - Gender could be chosen at different times in one's life as on a planet described in Ursula K. Le Guin's novel [The Left Hand of Darkness](http://amzn.com/0441007317?tag=skepticcom20-20). - We may be able to change racial characteristics including skin color. - Ethnocentrism will shift to more trivial group differences. - Technology won't transform human capacities. Tavris noted that despite the recent shift in thinking about homosexuality from preference to orientation, no clear biological component of homosexuality has been established. She talked about people having a variety of sexual thoughts and behaviors with indistinct categories of gender. She noted that identity is learned and one's sense of identity is strongest when most under attack. She speculated about a future of many sexual possibilities with a shift back to thinking about sexual preferences rather than orientations. Manhattan Institute linguistics scholar [John McWhorter](http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/mcwhorter.htm), an [associate professor](http://english.columbia.edu/people/profile/442) of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, was the last speaker of the morning program. McWhorter predicted that there will be fewer languages in 2525 since globalization kills them. Languages survive only if people learn them in the cradle. He said that after age 13, it is all but impossible to learn a language perfectly. He showed that small, obscure languages are especially complicated and difficult to learn with their many irregular verb forms. He predicted that one in three humans will speak English, not because there is anything special about English, but because \"it got there first,\" as most Web sites are now in English. He described the influence of English as a path dependent phenomenon similar to the QWERTY keyboard standard. While more people speak Mandarin than English, McWhorter said Mandarin will not be the universal language because the subtle tone differences in Mandarin make big differences in meaning and Chinese script is so difficult to decipher. He said it consists not merely of pictures, and described it as a \"bleeding, inefficient, tragic mess.\" He predicted that languages will get easier, and since speech\u2014not writing\u2014is what language is about, language will be more oral. The title of his talk sums up his message: \"World's Languages in 2525: Fewer, Easier, Oraller.\" The morning program concluded with a panel discussion with the morning speakers, which focused on exporting and importing features of different cultures. As much as Diamond likes visiting New Guinea, he said he wouldn't want to live there considering the violence and mistreatment of women. Tavris noted that you can't export cultural features like you can export cheese and that outsiders can mess up cultural and economic rules of societies. Diamond noted that sometimes outside intervention is welcomed. He gave the example of New Guinea welcoming imposition of outside force to save them. The afternoon program began with [Richard Dawkins](https://richarddawkins.net/richarddawkins/), one of the most influential scientists in the world, in conversation with the Skeptics Society's [Michael Shermer](https://michaelshermer.com/). Shermer brought up the [Pew Research Center poll results](https://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/) from May, which showed that the 56 million people in the U.S. who are religiously unaffiliated (often called the \"nones\") outnumber both mainline Protestants and Catholics. Dawkins generated laughs from the audience and media coverage with this comment: \"One of the problems is that the so-called 'nones' often give up religion for something even worse. I mean, they take up [Deepak Chopra](https://www.skeptic.com/insight/quantum-leaps/) or something like that.\" (In his book [The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success](http://amzn.com/1878424718?tag=skepticcom20-20), Chopra's \"Law of Detachment\" calls for relinquishing attachment to the physical universe and his \"Law of Least Effort\" calls for harmony, love, and accepting people, situations, circumstances, and events as they occur. Chopra ignored those laws and the day after the conference he sniped back at Dawkins on Twitter, which got him media attention.) I enjoyed the intellectual stimulation Dawkins provided in his wide-ranging conversation with Shermer, who pushed him on political issues, such as to what extent the U.S. and UK should intervene in Middle Eastern matters involving the violation of human rights. Dawkins admitted that: \"We on the left are so afraid of being thought of as racist that we bend over backwards...\" while misogyny in Islam gets a free pass. While describing himself as an \"old-fashioned imperialist\" in objecting to severe female genital mutilation, he noted difficulties in intervening with cultures and the need to be very cautious before launching military actions with \"boots on the ground.\" In the context of the evolutionary origins of morality, Shermer asked Dawkins his opinion on a popular theory of group selection, to which Dawkins replied \"group selection is bollocks;\" and that kin selection and reciprocal altruism explain altruism. He said that we are \"programmed\" with rules of thumb that work under normal environmental conditions that can result in altruism. He gave as an example a bird's rule of thumb to feed squawking things in a nest, but by following the rule a bird can wind up feeding another species. That's a mistake in a Darwiniain sense, but it's a wonderful mistake because it produces niceness. After all, he said, no one wants to live in a Darwinian world of morality; real morality is not Darwinian. Shermer pressed him to use a different word than \"mistake\" because it implies that morality is not real, in some transcendent sense. Dawkins replied that they were quibbling about semantics. He endorsed Shermer's latest book [The Moral Arc: How Science and Reason Lead Humanity toward Truth, Justice, and Freedom](https://moralarc.org/) but his phrasing [may not have come out as intended](https://moralarc.org/endorsements-and-reviews/). Dawkins gave the audience a good laugh when he said: \"The last chapter of The Moral Arc is very inspiring. It's worth plodding through to the end.\" As a professor of public health, I was delighted that the next speaker, [Esther Dyson](http://www.biography.com/people/esther-dyson-9542200), a distinguished expert in business and technology, discussed her work in the area of community-based disease prevention (to make a difference in the here and now, if not for the far future of humanity). She noted that little is spent on prevention and most health interventions are too weak to have an impact\u2014like peeing in reservoir. So in order to create a healthier world, she decided to begin with one community at a time through [HICCup](http://www.hiccup.co/), the not-for-profit Health Initiative Coordinating Council she founded. She described her team's approach as pouring rose water into five bathtubs. The five \"bathtubs\" are geographically remote communities selected from 42 communities from 26 states that submitted applications last year for \"The Way to Wellville Challenge.\" Motto: \"five places. five metrics. years.\" The chosen places are: Clatsop County, Oregon; Greater Muskegon, Michigan; Lake County, California; Niagara Falls, New York and Spartanburg, South Carolina. It wasn't clear to me what five metrics were chosen for assessing the outcome of the project and she described the initiative as \"a pseudo-clinical trial.\" Epidemiologists refer to such projects as community trials or field trials. I'm not sure what [community-oriented public health intervention plans](http://www.nap.edu/catalog/18946/the-role-and-potential-of-communities-in-population-health-improvement) for the Wellville communities look like, but Dyson mentioned some of the issues to be addressed include jail-acquired insolvency, reduction of incarceration, and making it easy for companies to make money selling good food. I couldn't tell from Dyson's presentation or from the HICCup Web site how well the five-year study of the Wellville communities is aligned with principles of [community-based participatory research](http://obssr.od.nih.gov/scientific_areas/methodology/community_based_participatory_research/) that are emphasized in projects supported by the National Institutes of Health. Nevertheless, it was good to learn about an initiative aligned with the [socio-ecological framework for prevention](http://90by30.uoregon.edu/socio-ecological-model). Next up was the scientist, best-selling author, and tech-futurist [David Brin](http://www.davidbrin.com/biography.html), who posed the question: \"How do we deal with the tentative Renaissance Enlightenment that we're in?\" He said that future scenarios explored in science fiction are sometimes apocalyptic and dystopian. But his overall message was hopeful. He talked about cameras now coming at us from anywhere, but he hailed a 2013 court decision giving citizens the [right to record the police](http://davidbrin.blogspot.ca/2013/09/transparency-news-nsa-has-yawn-foiled.html). He talked about the history of technology and described the development of printing and glass lenses as the first prosthetics. He suggested that new technologies present crises of progress. \"Grouches\" may be right about new technologies in the short-term, he said, but \"transcendentalists\" have been right after painful adjustments. Brin discussed the dance of competition and cooperation that creates a positive sum game rather than a zero sum game in our country. He described regulated markets as serving to ensure justice. Liberals, he said, should view [Adam Smith](http://davidbrin.blogspot.ca/2013/11/liberals-youmust-reclaim-adam-smith.html), as their hero. Reading Smith's [The Wealth of Nations](http://amzn.com/1505577128?tag=skepticcom20-20) is now on my reading to-do list\u2014right ahead of the novel [Timescape](http://amzn.com/0553297090?tag=skepticcom20-20) by [Gregory Benford](http://www.gregorybenford.com/biography/), a professor of physics at the University of California, Irvine, who has worked with other scientists and science fiction writers in addressing the challenges and opportunities of a 100-year project to create a starship. That's quite a visionary goal. By contrast, he noted that Thomas Jefferson thought it would take a thousand years for the American frontier to reach the Pacific Ocean. After mentioning our lack of attention to the present-day problem of some six million tons of debris that humans have left in orbit around the earth, Benford focused on the challenges of space exploration. \"Space will kill you,\" he said. Threats from space travel include fire, radiation, air leaks, low oxygen, low gravity, carbon dioxide accumulation, and bad food. But he also mentioned potential benefits. For example, asteroids are a source of water and Mars has same surface area as land areas of earth. Benford suggested that we should expect the unexpected when we open new horizons, but it will pay off, even in 2525. The final speaker on the program was [Arthur Benjamin](https://www.math.hmc.edu/~benjamin/), Smallwood Family Professor of Mathematics at Harvey Mudd College, who has been described as the world's greatest living lightning calculator. Benjamin gave one of his many remarkable performances of solving arithmetic problems in his head faster than audience members can with calculators. I was especially amazed when he rapidly constructed a 4\u00d74 [magic square](http://mathforum.org/alejandre/magic.square/adler/adler.whatsquare.html) based on entering an audience member's birth date in the top row. Benjamin noted that 47% of U.S. teachers have standardized math test scores in the bottom, while in elite-performing countries in mathematics such as Singapore, 100% of teachers are in the top third. I left the conference utterly confused about the prospects for humanity in 2525, but cautiously optimistic for the future my son will face. One of my immediate concerns is deciding which book authored by one of the conference speakers I should read next. The Way of the Mister: If I'm wrong...

About this week's eSkeptic Are the greatest artists, musicians, and writers melancholic, bipolar, alcoholic, drug addicted, schizophrenic, autistic, or disordered in other ways? How can we know, with any degree of certainty, whether creativity and mental illness are related? In this week's eSkeptic, Dr. Carol Tavris takes a look at the persistent myth of the mad genius. This article appeared in [Skeptic magazine 20.1](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/20.1/) (2015). Carol Tavris is a social psychologist and coauthor, with Elliot Aronson, of [Mistakes were made (but not by ME)](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b157PB). The Persistent Myth of the Mad Genius by Carol Tavris Do you have to be crazy to be creative? Must artists choose between genius and sanity, artistry and love? In the 2014 film [Whiplash](https://itunes.apple.com/movie/whiplash/id935216672?at=10l6ex), the answers are the familiar yes and yes. Brilliant teenage drummer, inspired but brutally provoked by his sadistic teacher, learns that the worst lesson in the world for an aspiring musical genius is that it's all right to be \"good enough.\" Any antidote to mediocrity is worthy, but the film's alternative vision to being \"good enough\" is that an artist must suffer, and I mean suffer, to become great: demeaning insults! public humiliation, enough to make a lesser person\u2014a merely talented mortal\u2014hang himself! practice until your fingers bleed! give up any possibility of love! Tell that to Itzhak Perlman or Yo-Yo Ma. Many people who enjoyed this film saw it as a duel between a gifted boy and his nasty, much-less-gifted teacher, in which (spoiler alert, not that I'm spoiling much of a surprise) the gifted boy ultimately triumphs, though at the price of losing his girlfriend. In the New York Times, Quentin Hardy reviewed the similar portrayals of math geniuses, from Alan Turing's cold heartlessness in [The Imitation Game](https://itunes.apple.com/movie/the-imitation-game/id908562871?at=10l6ex) to John Nash's paranoid schizophrenia in [A Beautiful Mind](https://itunes.apple.com/movie/a-beautiful-mind/id324270794?at=10l6ex). In these and so many other films, we learn (as does the hero) that the price of brilliance is an inability to feel deep emotion and to love. Except that wasn't so; the filmmakers edited out pesky details that didn't fit the narrative they wanted to tell. Nash was arrogant \"but he also had a number of relationships with people of both sexes,\" and Turing, who had numerous lasting friendships, suffered more from being gay in a time of savage repression of homosexuality than from being mathematically brilliant. Depicting these geniuses as having impoverished social lives, writes Hardy, \"signals our ambivalence\"\u2014 toward computers, toward science, and toward genius. [1](#note01) Certainly the dominant view among scholars is that creativity, genius, and madness are linked in some deeply rooted biological and psychological way, as psychologists Dean Keith Simonton ( [The Origins Brain](http://amzn.com/0452287812?tag=skepticcom20-20)) have argued for years. But whenever there is a consensus view, there is usually a skeptic raising provocative questions from the sidelines, and the creativity field has Judith Schlesinger. Indeed, for a new edited volume from Cambridge University Press, [Creativity and Mental Illness](http://amzn.com/1107021693?tag=skepticcom20-20), Schlesinger was invited to write \"the cautionary chapter.\" [2](#note02) The book itself is described as re-examining \"the common view that a high level of individual creativity often correlates with a heightened risk of mental illness. It reverses conventional wisdom that links creativity with mental illness, arguing that the two traits are not associated.\" That is precisely the reversal that Schlesinger argues more fully in her book [The Insanity Hoax: Exposing the Myth of the Mad Genius](http://amzn.com/0983698244?tag=skepticcom20-20), [3](#note03) a short, clear, witty, and empirically grounded takedown of the mad-genius assumption. Schlesinger, a psychologist and musician herself, acknowledges at the outset the familiar, tragic stories of many beloved musicians\u2014as diverse as Beethoven, Berlioz, Jimi Hendrix, Judy Garland, Charlie Parker, and Billie Holiday\u2014and the observations of philosophers and scientists from Plato and Aristotle to the present day that the greatest artists are melancholic, bipolar, alcoholic, drug addicted, schizophrenic, autistic, or disordered in other ways. We think with sorrow of the deaths of Robin Williams and Philip Seymour Hoffman, which confirm our view of the great but suffering actor, and forget the long and satisfying lives of other great actors, such as Paul Newman, Robert Redford, and Maggie Smith, which disconfirm it. We ignore the fact that Robert Downey Jr. triumphed over drug and alcohol addiction with no diminution of his acting talent or career. Schlesinger begins with examples of how the media reflect and perpetuate the mad-genius myth, with headlines such as \"How Inner Torment Feeds the Creative Spirit\" and articles claiming that creativity and mental illness are linked, \"particularly in artists, musicians, and writers.\" Many artists suffer from the belief that they have to suffer to be great. Saxophonist Bud Shank told an interviewer that two writers had given up the project of writing his biography \"because they couldn't find anything wrong with me. I haven't been in jail, I haven't been an alcoholic, I haven't done anything nasty\u2014so in their eyes, as far as what sells books about jazz musicians, there was nothing to write about. Ever since Van Gogh cut his ear off, everybody thinks an artist has to be a hurt artist. It's like you're no good otherwise.\" To know with some degree of certainty, rather than anecdote, whether creativity and mental illness are related, you have to define and measure them clearly, and, as Schlesinger shows, that has not been done. Not for want of trying; it's just that the subject is hydra-headed and complex. Many studies are based on hearsay; many rely on self-selected or experimenter-chosen subjects, which bias the investigation from the start. Schlesinger admits her own bias at the outset: she detests \"the patronizing caricature of the mad creative and how it devalues the artistic product.\" The effort to link creativity and madness, she believes, \"is as futile as grabbing at clouds.\" No one disputes the evidence that many creative people and geniuses have serious psychological problems, ranging from depression to schizophrenia, and these are the people who capture our attention and sorrow, who have biographies written about them, who are the subjects of films. But many creative people have no ruinous mental-health problems and many bakers, librarians, and lawyers do. It's telling that there is no \"mad baker\" theory of the culinary arts. The first step in critical thinking is \"define your terms,\" and that is one reason for the muddle about this issue. What is creativity, exactly? There are hundreds of definitions and measures. What is genius? Your IQ test score or your achievements? Is artistic genius different from mathematical genius? Are we left with \"we know them when we see them\"? But what do we know, and how does what we know affect what we see? Schlesinger's critique of the methodological problems in the most famous studies that have claimed to find links between creativity and madness is eye-opening. Many used too few participants for meaningful results (Andreasen took 15 years to study 30 people); they enlisted people who were personally known to the sole interviewer and judge; they relied on idiosyncratic rather than standardized measurements of mood disorders (Jamison's diagnosis of an artist's mood disorder was simply his claim that he had been treated for it); and they generalize the results from highly specialized samples to the population at large. Andreasen admitted her results were not statistically significant; Jamison didn't have a control group, so she didn't bother with statistics at all. \"...however much we want to romanticize [genius], it is typified by qualities that are disappointingly opposite of psychotic: self-discipline, tenacity, organization, calmness, and strong self-image.\" The myth dictates that supremely creative people \"are either inflamed by mania, frozen in despair, or endlessly whiplashed between the two,\" says Schlesinger. \"But it's just as easy\u2014and much better documented\u2014to view the creative process as healthy and life-affirming.\" She cites personality psychologist Daniel Nettle's review, which found that \"psychological studies have shown again and again that, however much we want to romanticize [genius], it is typified by qualities that are disappointingly opposite of psychotic: self-discipline, tenacity, organization, calmness, and strong self-image.\" Having a high IQ, the technical definition of \"genius,\" doesn't explain much either, even if there is a strong genetic component to it. Genius, unlike cream, does not inevitably rise to the top; success depends more on drive and determination. In 1921, Louis Terman and his associates began following more than 1,500 children with IQ scores in the top one percent of the distribution. These children, nicknamed Termites after Terman, started out bright, physically healthy, and well adjusted. But some failed to live up to their early promise, dropping out of school or drifting into low-level work. The 100 most successful men had been ambitious, were socially active, had many interests, and had been encouraged by their parents. The 100 least successful drifted casually through life. There was no average difference in IQ, or in mental illness, between the two groups. Schlesinger describes the subsequent studies by Albert Rothenberg and his associates, who concluded, after 25 years of studying creative thinking in living artists and scientists, that \"there is no specific personality type associated with outstanding creativity. Creative people are not necessarily childish and erratic in human relationships, as is often thought, nor are they necessarily extraordinarily egotistic or rebellious or eccentric.\" Only one characteristic was present in all creative people: motivation. They want to be creative, and are willing to put consistent effort into that goal. This may be the craziest thing about them, because their talents and determination can be threatening to the non-geniuses around them. By definition, they want to do things differently. They often don't get along with their conformist colleagues. They are perfectionists, which annoys their \"it's good enough\" colleagues. They are rebels, and as social psychologists have amply demonstrated, Americans may praise rebels but are uncomfortable with them. At the heart of genius lies motivation, hard work, and persistence. How obvious, how annoying, how unromantic! \"Unfortunately,\" Schlesinger notes wryly, \"hard work will never be as thrilling as drowning, whether in the white waters of ecstasy or the sludge of despair.\" That is not a popular message, especially, she says, in a culture that promotes the notion that everyone is the same and all must have prizes, a culture that values self-esteem over ability, effort, and competence. No wonder that many people welcome the myth of the mad genius. It gets them off the hook of the sheer hard work that artistry and genius require: practice, learning, coming back from failures along the way. We may not share that spark of genius, we might feel twinges or envy or resentment toward geniuses and the \"unfair\" advantage their talent confers on them, but look at their miserable lives. At least we're not crazy.

Ian Morris is Professor of History at Stanford University and a Fellow of the Stanford Archaeology Center. His book Why the West Rules \u2014 For Now traces the patterns of history and what they reveal about the future. His latest book is Foragers, Farmers, and Fossil Fuels: How Human Values Evolve, a compelling new argument about the evolution of human values, one that has far-reaching implications for how we understand the past \u2014 and for what might happen next. Fundamental long-term changes in values, Morris argues, are driven by the most basic force of all: energy. Humans have found three main ways to get the energy they need \u2014 from foraging, farming, and fossil fuels. Each energy source sets strict limits on what kinds of societies can succeed, and each kind of society rewards specific values. But if our fossil-fuel world favors democratic, open societies, the ongoing revolution in energy capture means that our most cherished values are very likely to turn out not to be useful any more.

DISTINGUISHED SCIENCE LECTURE Andrew Hodges \u2014 Alan Turing: The Enigma It is only a slight exaggeration to say that the British mathematician Alan Turing (1912-1954) saved the Allies from the Nazis, invented the computer and artificial intelligence, and anticipated gay liberation by decades\u2014all before his suicide at age 41. In November a major motion picture starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing will be released, based on the classic biography by Dr. Andrew Hodges, who teaches mathematics at Wadham College, University of Oxford (he is also an active contributor to the mathematics of fundamental physics). Hodges tells how Turing's revolutionary idea of 1936\u2014the concept of a universal machine\u2014laid the foundation for the modern computer and how Turing brought the idea to practical realization in 1945 with his electronic design. Hodges also tells how this work was directly related to Turing's leading role in breaking the German Enigma ciphers during World War II, a scientific triumph that was critical to Allied victory in the Atlantic. At the same time, this is the tragic story of a man who, despite his wartime service, was eventually arrested, stripped of his security clearance, and forced to undergo a humiliating treatment program\u2014all for trying to live honestly in a society that defined homosexuality as a crime.

DIALOGUE ON THE NATURE OF SCIENCE Rupert Sheldrake & Michael Shermer Beginning earlier this month, and continuing through July, TheBestSchools.org is hosting [an intensive dialogue on the nature of science](http://www.thebestschools.org/special/sheldrake-shermer-dialogue-nature-of-science/) between [Rupert Sheldrake](http://www.thebestschools.org/features/rupert-sheldrake-interview/) and [Michael Shermer](http://www.thebestschools.org/features/michael-shermer-interview/). Dr. Sheldrake will defend that science needs to free itself from materialist dogma; indeed, science misunderstands nature by being wedded to purely materialist explanations. By contrast, Dr. Shermer will defend that science, properly conceived, is a materialistic enterprise; for science to look beyond materialist explanations is to betray science and engage in superstition. Since May 1st, Sheldrake and Shermer have posted their opening statements, as well as a response and a reply on the topic of Materialism in Science. [conference](https://www.skeptic.com/tag/conference/), [science](https://www.skeptic.com/tag/science/), [vimeo this week's Hall, M.D., the SkepDoc, reviews [The Gluten Lie: and other myths about what you eat](http://amzn.com/1941393063?tag=skepticcom20-20), by Alan Levinovitz. Harriet Hall is a retired family physician and Air Force Colonel living in Puyallup, WA. She writes about alternative medicine, pseudoscience, quackery, and critical thinking. She is a contributing editor to both Skeptic and Skeptical Inquirer, an advisor to the Quackwatch website, and an editor of Sciencebasedmedicine.org, where she writes an article every Tuesday. She is author of [Women Aren't Supposed to Fly: The Memoirs of a Female Flight Surgeon](http://amzn.com/0595499589?tag=skepticcom20-20). Her website is [www.skepdoc.info](http://www.skepdoc.info/). Food Faiths & Diet Religions a review by Harriet Hall, M.D., the SkepDoc The parade of diet fads is unending; they will continue to proliferate as long as humans have to eat. They have created a hellish world in which every food component is a potential demon: fat, gluten, carbs, sugar, wheat, salt, etc. Diet gurus, both professional and amateur, are always ready to tell us what to eat or not to eat. Their advice is supported by great enthusiasm and plentiful testimonials but little scientific evidence. In his new book [The Gluten Lie: and other myths about what you eat](http://amzn.com/1941393063?tag=skepticcom20-20) Alan Levinovitz examines the diet myth phenomenon from a refreshingly different viewpoint. He might seem like a strange candidate to author a book on diet. He's not a nutrition expert, a doctor, or even a scientist; he is a scholar of religion. But that gives him a unique perspective. His expertise is in studying religious stories that function as metaphors. He says the key to understanding fad diets is not science, but history. \"Once you see enough of the same archetypal myths and the same superstitions, new dietary claims start to look a lot like flood myths.\" They do indeed. The same memes keep repeating. Good vs. evil. Natural vs. manmade. Magical thinking: you are what you eat. The scary technology of the modern world vs. the idealistic Eden our ancestors supposedly enjoyed (they didn't!). Evolutionary \"Just So Stories\" that convert what we think our ancestors ate into what we should eat or argue that since evolution didn't equip us with sharp fangs, we shouldn't eat meat. People presume to know Nature's intentions. Clean, pure, virtuous foods vs. \"unclean\" forbidden foods, toxins, and sinful indulgence. We are being manipulated for profit by evil big corporations to the detriment of our health. Subconscious Puritan values kick in: if it's pleasurable, it must be bad. Religious-like mantras divide the world into simplistic binary categories. Following the strict guidelines of the in-group proves you are a good person. Moral and religious vocabulary is inappropriately applied to scientific questions. Levinovitz suggests that it would be helpful for scholars of folk and fairy tales to examine nutrition myths. Folklore studies would be able to classify diet stories into repeated story types like \"miracle food from Tibet,\" \"dietary cures for chronic disease,\" and \"everyday food is poisonous.\" To many people science is suspect because of the steady stream of scientific reversals on butter, wine, or whatever food appears in the headlines. But he points out that these are not reversals at all, because nothing was ever established in the first place. The headlines report single preliminary studies that are questionable, not scientific consensus based on an accumulated body of reliable data. True science is humble, cautious, and embraces complexity and uncertainty. \"The unpleasant reality is that we don't know what constitutes an 'ideal' diet, and there may be no such thing.\" Eating in moderation has always been the common sense mainstay of diet advice, and science has added nothing that stands up to rigorous scrutiny. Levinovitz advocates removing the fear and restoring the pleasure in eating. \"Fiction, not food, is the real demon.\" With healthy helpings of history and skepticism, we can learn to laugh at fads and eat our dinner in peace. As Levinovitz relates the history of MSG, gluten, fat, sugar, and salt, the repeated memes produce a strong sensation of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: someone makes a chance observation, gets an Idea that might explain the observation, extrapolates to apply the Idea to everyone, does a poor-quality uncontrolled study that seems to support the Idea, and persuades people to try his diet. They respond because the Idea strikes a chord, fits in with their worldview, is emotionally satisfying, and seems scientifically plausible. When they change their diet, they tend to eat healthier because they cook at home and eat less junk food. They feel better for psychological reasons and placebo effects, confirmation bias kicks in, and they spread the word with testimonials. Eventually more rigorous scientific studies debunk the Idea, but it is too late. MSG is exonerated, but people continue to believe MSG is the reason for their symptoms. Emerging evidence suggests that non-celiac gluten sensitivity may not be sensitivity ( [Fermentable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_flora#carbohydrate_fermentation_and_absorption) [Oligo-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligosaccharide), [Di-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaccharide), [Mono-saccharides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monosaccharide) And [Polyols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyol)); if that is confirmed, we can predict that people will continue to believe gluten is the culprit. Once people's minds are made up, they resist new evidence. Anecdotes and big Ideas reinforce powerful myths and promise simple solutions to a variety of health problems. Asking someone to question their food beliefs is tantamount to asking them to change their religion. Levinovitz has done his research, and he understands science better than many scientists. He says, If we are serious about the quest for good health, physical and mental, we cannot be slaves to fear and to our desire for easy answers. We must honestly admit our ignorance. We must recognize our capacity for self-deception. And when others\u2014including medical and scientific professionals\u2014refuse to do the same, we must learn to recognize their lies. Most fad diets have been definitively debunked by scientific evidence. He doesn't mince words: he says [Grain Brain](http://amzn.com/031623480X?tag=skepticcom20-20) is a lie. Unfortunately, professional organizations don't always follow the evidence. They promote their own lies, recommending low salt and low fat diets long after they should have been discarded for lack of evidence. They see themselves as experts and saviors and their egos won't let them admit they have been giving their patients bad advice and making false dogmatic pronouncements about things that are far from settled. There is no good evidence that low fat diets are healthier. The low salt recommendations are practically impossible to follow; they may be advisable for a small sub-section of the population that is salt-sensitive, but for the rest of us, low salt diets are unnecessary and may create problems like potassium deficiency. The book ends with two appendixes: (1) The Unpacked Diet and (2) UNPACKED: The Unpacked Diet. The first is a persuasive argument that the problem is not what you eat but what it is packaged in. It cites numerous scientific studies showing that plastics (like BPA), Styrofoam, and even aluminum have deadly health effects. By switching to Unpacked-approved packaging materials, you will experience health benefits: weight loss, sound sleep, lower blood pressure, no risk of cancer or Alzheimer's, no more acne, dry skin or brain fog. It recommends a 9-day \"detox\" trial to see for yourself how much better you will feel when you avoid those toxic packaging materials. The second appendix is an annotated version of the first revealing that it is a satire and showing how it copies the methods of diet faddists, reproduces their testimonials word for word, cherry-picks scientific studies that appear to support the thesis, uses faulty logic, plays on emotions, and is designed to thoroughly mislead readers. I would encourage you to read the first version and try critiquing it yourself before you read the second. It's a good exercise to see how much you have learned from the book. [The Gluten Lie](http://amzn.com/1941393063?tag=skepticcom20-20) is well written, entertaining, solidly referenced, and perhaps the best debunking of popular diet myths ever. Reading it will equip you to quickly spot the flaws and the recurrent myths in the next fad that you will inevitably encounter.

About this week's eSkeptic In this week's eSkeptic, we present a skeptical classic: an interview with a co-founder of modern skepticism: Ray Hyman. This interview first appeared in [Skeptic magazine 6.2](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/6.2/), back in 1998. The Truth is Out There and Ray Hyman Wants to Find it by Michael Shermer Three names dominate the early history of the modern skeptical movement: James Randi, Martin Gardner, and Ray Hyman. Perhaps less wellknown by the general public than the first two, Ray Hyman is the only one of the group with formal training in the experimental sciences (although the other two have more than made up for it with hands-on real world experience). That training has come in handy in Hyman's dealings with pseudoscience and the paranormal, as he has continuously (from the 1950s on) conducted formal and informal investigations of all manner of extraordinary claims, from Uri Geller's ability to bend spoons to the CIA's remote viewing experiments. When the Department of Defense needed someone to investigate the Israeli spoon-bending psychic, they called Ray Hyman. When James Randi needs advice on statistical analysis, he often calls Ray Hyman. When Scientific American needed advice on experimental protocol to test a water dowser for their TV series Frontiers they called Ray Hyman. When the government needed an objective outsider to examine the data from the CIA's remote viewing experiments, they called Ray Hyman. Hyman is meticulous in his research, careful in his analysis, and always thoughtful in dealing with claimants, many of whom it would be generous to call cranks and charlatans. But Hyman is more interested in how we all deceive ourselves than in how scam artists deceive the few us. Ray Hyman turns 70 this year [86 as of the publication date of this eSkeptic], and with that he plans to retire from a long and productive academic career as an experimental psychologist. But this won't slow his quest to find the truth about psi, the paranormal, and the psychology of belief, a quest which began when he was a young boy growing up as second of three children in Everett, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. Hyman's older brother was killed during World War II at Iwo Jima, and his younger sister is a recently retired college art instructor. His father was a native-born accountant and his mother was a dressmaker who immigrated from Russia. The only Jews in their neighborhood, Hyman's parents fretted over \"what the neighbors thought,\" and for good reason in those less enlightened and tolerant days before WWII. For the intellectually precocious Hyman, however, the religious impulse never clicked. \"When I went to synagogue as a kid I'd come home and say, 'This is a smelly place and the people there are crooks who come here and pretend they're religious'. I never had a religious feeling.\" The astute youngster began his data collection early by noting that \"When I lived in Italy, the Catholic ceremonies were beautiful. I always felt I was missing something. I guess this could make people feel good, but I've never had any of that. I empathize with people who have, however.\" He was bar mitzvahed at 13, but \"that was the end of it. I didn't understand what was going on and I could see the whole thing was a phony ritual.\" The product of a politically left-leaning home, Hyman was raised to worship Franklin Roosevelt. He observed \"Uncle Joe\" (Stalin) change from an ally and hero during the war against Hitler, to an arch enemy after the war. \"This struck me as weird,\" as did his father's sudden loss of faith, which taught Hyman the power of belief systems: \"I remember that when my brother got killed my father suddenly announced that he was an atheist. It was over, just like that. He had nothing more to do with religion of any kind.\" The death of his brother also taught Hyman something about the psychology of anomalous experiences, and about probabilities. His brother landed on the beach at Normandy on D-day and survived. Later he was shipped to the Pacific, after which \"I remember my mother had this dream that my brother was going to be killed and sure enough, next day or two we got the telegram. I told her, and I was only 16, 'Look, you've been having that dream every night that he has been in the service!' And practically everyone during the initial invasion of Iwo Jima was killed.\" Coupled to these youthful experiences was Hyman's early interest in magic, and the lessons he learned from his first hero\u2014Harry Houdini: When I was in high school I went to every spiritualist seance I could find in the Boston area because I wanted to be like Houdini. I was going to expose all this stuff. The first thing I noticed was that I was the oddball there; it was mostly elderly women and a few elderly men...and me, this young kid! They accepted me, more or less, and I took some spiritualist development classes where they tried to teach us how to reach the spirit world. We were assigned a guiding spirit. I don't know why, but all the spirits had American Indian names\u2014one was Chief Looking Glass. After three or four sessions they were all doing it and pretty soon I was the only one not apparently seeing the spirits, so I finally dropped out. It was his first official skeptical investigation that would lead to a lifelong quest to find the truth that he knew was out there...somewhere. I sat down with Ray at the January, 1998 \"Gathering for Gardner Three\" (G4G3), an eclectic collection of mathematicians, magicians, mentalists, game designers, scholars, scientists, and anyone interested in the varied intellectual products of clever minds, who gathered to pay tribute to their collective colleague and hero, Martin Gardner. Skeptic: What sort of things did you discover about the world of spiritualism in those early experiences? Hyman: I'll tell you a story. I was sitting in a general spiritmessage seance, performed as a come-on to get you into their private readings the next day. People put their \"spirit messages\" in a basket, and this old guy, blindfolded, pulled out the messages one by one, held them to his forehead, and pretended to read them. He was peeking down his nose under his blindfold and reading the message he had opened on the lectern while holding a substitute message to his forehead. Because he was older and his eyesight not so good, he was blatantly pushing the blindfold up and away from his eyes as he leaned forward to get a better view of the message. So I nudged the lady sitting beside me, but she was looking at the ceiling. She looked at me, looked around the room, then looked back up at the ceiling. I looked around the room and it dawned on me that none of these people were looking at this guy because they didn't want to know it was a fake. Related to this, every Wednesday night my father used to take me to professional wrestling matches at the Boston Garden, which he loved. Here I noticed that there was always a good guy and a bad guy, and I also wondered how these guys could still see when they gouged each other's eyes out every week, and that there were all these different \"world\" champions (how many can you have?!). So it occurred to me that professional wrestling was also a fake. One time, just for fun, I began cheering for the villain, and this lady got up and came over and started swinging her purse and hitting me with it. After a while I tried to talk my father out of it but he didn't want to hear it. Skeptic: They willingly suspended their disbelief? Hyman: Right. People don't want to know the truth behind the fa\u00e7ade. Decades ago this professor at Oregon State University put on this conference on confidence games and cons of all kinds (he called it \"The Big CONference\"). Jerry Andrus and I were there, and the Oregon State newspaper ran my picture with the headline HE TAKES AWAY SANTA CLAUS. I'll always remember that because it is a good lesson on how people react to skeptics. Skepticism is always seen as negative, where people think we are are taking something away without putting anything back. It reminds me of an experience I had as a professor teaching a course on pseudopsychology in 1970, just before Uri Geller came on the scene. At the end of the course a student came to me and said \"You know, Professor Hyman, as a result of taking your course I now realize how I've been fooling myself. And I see how others fool themselves as well. But, you know, I wish I had never taken your class. I hate your guts.\" Skeptic: He was serious? Hyman: Oh, yes, this was no joke. I realized again that people just don't want to know. Many years later, for example, a wellknown magician came up to me and said he needed to talk to me. Paul was a very active skeptic, and at that time he was dating this woman who gave \"readings\" to people in Hollywood, but presented them as real. And he said to me, \"You know, Ray, there is an ethical issue here. Do I have the right to try to convince them that they are being fooled? Is this fulfilling some purpose for them and I'm just taking it away?\" That is a real issue for skeptics. Skeptic: What is your answer to this ethical question? Hyman: My answer explains why I'm always called the softy of the skeptical movement. Randi's approach is to get out there and confront them. I'm the nonconfrontational skeptic. I'm the good cop, he's the bad cop. I'm in the ivory tower, Randi's out there in the trenches. I can afford to be flexible. He can't. Out there you can't give them any wiggle room. My approach is that I don't want to shove anything down anyone's throat. But if they want to know, I'm willing to tell them about it. Skeptic: You're not the proselytizing type? Hyman: No. In fact, one of the main things I have against almost every religion is the proselytizing aspect of it. I tell them, \"Look, if it is so good why do you need to sell me God?\" Skeptic: You've been interested in magic all your life. What is the connection between magic and skepticism for you? Hyman: It is through magic that I got into skepticism. Most magicians are skeptics (unlike most mentalists, who tend to believe in the paranormal). So I always took it for granted as a magician that I was also a skeptic. I did my first magic show when I was seven years old. My father gave me a magic kit that I took to school for \"show and tell,\" and the teacher thought it was good enough that she asked me to do it for a PTA meeting. So I did that and they gave me $5, which in those days was a lot of money. So I had a business card made and the printer called me \"The Merry Mystic,\" because we lived on the Mystic River at the time, and he put a rabbit and a hat on the card, so I was now a real magician. And I bought a top hat and the next week the library hired me for a story hour show, and it took off from there. I started getting shows regularly and hanging out at magic shops, and really learned the craft. And I did shows for money all the way through my last year of college at Boston University. Skeptic: Is this how you got into palm reading? Hyman: Well, early on in my magic career I realized I could make more money doing mentalism than magic. People would pay me at least three times more for a mentalism show than for a magic show. The reason is that they assumed the magic tricks were tricks, but that mentalism was real. I would always come out and tell them at the beginning, \"Look, I am going to do something here but I'm not claiming any special powers, although I have practiced this a lot, so you decide what is going on here.\" And with this I never got challenged. I was always considered a mind reader. After every show, and I was just a little kid, these women would take me aside and tell me about their personal lives and I was blushing, and they wanted a private reading with me. I realized that I only needed to get one little fact about them and they would attribute all kinds of powers to me. Skeptic: How have you used this to better your understanding of the psychology of deception? Hyman: When I was studying psychology, the \"psychology of deception\" was really the \"psychology of conjuring.\" The assumption was that if you understand how conjuring works you understand deception. But as I worked on an article about this, I realized that this cannot be the case because there is a big difference between conjuring and deception in everyday life. In conjuring, the last thing you want is for people not to realize they are being deceived. When I'm up there on stage, if people do not realize they have been deceived then I have failed as a magician. But in real life scam artists try desperately not to let the person know they are being deceived. Good con games take people over and over. On the flip side, if people know they are being deceived and you can still deceive them through magic, that is a powerful lesson. Skeptic: What did you learn about yourself in doing magic and mentalism? Hyman: Going back in time, I did palm readings for years, and for awhile I had become a gung ho believer. I started as a skeptic but as I added things to my repertoire I became a believer. I couldn't travel as a young magician so I was forced to play at the same places and had to come up with new things for them. This is when I took up palm reading. I watched people in the carnies and got to know them and picked up a lot of things from them. I didn't want to do sword swallowing or anything like that, but with palm reading you could tell people all sorts of detailed things about themselves, like when they had a heart attack, at what age they were when they had a problem with their head, and so on. By high school, even though I was a skeptic about most things, I believed in palm reading because it seemed plausible to me since the palm is physically connected with the body. Skeptic: How did this tie in with your studies at Boston University? Were you a psychology major? Hyman: Actually I was a journalism major. This was 1946 and out of a high school class of about a thousand, less than 20 of us went to college. I didn't know what to major in, but my guidance counselor gave me a vocational test and he told me I should be a journalist. In my second year in college they gave me an assignment to interview a reporter, which I did, but this guy told me that the last thing you want to do to become a reporter is to take journalism classes! So I switched to psychology. I distinctly remember an incident at Boston University\u2014one of those you always remember\u2014when the psychology department chair called me into his office one day, closed the door, sat me down, and proceeded to dress me down for doing palm reading, for taking people's money under false pretenses, that there was nothing to this paranormal stuff and so on. I sat there listening to him and after he calmed down I said, \"would you like me to read your palm?\" So he stuck his hand out and I did a reading on him. Then I left. Two weeks later he called me back into his office, shut the door, sat me down, stuck his hand out, and said \"tell me more!\" This really showed me how powerful this stuff can be. And in another one of those unforgettable incidents, the late Stanley Jaks convinced me to do a palm reading on someone and tell them the exact opposite of what I would normally say. So I did this. If I thought I saw in this woman's palm that she had heart trouble at age 5, for example, I said, \"well, you have a very strong heart,\" that sort of thing. In this particular case, though, it was really spooky, because she just sat there poker faced. Usually I get a lot of feedback from the subject. In fact, I depend on the feedback, and this woman was giving me nothing. It was weird. I thought I bombed. But it turns out the reason she was so quiet was because she was stunned. She told me it was the most impressive reading she had ever had. So I did this with a couple more clients, and I suddenly realized that whatever was going on had nothing to do with what I said but with the presentation itself. This was one of the reasons I went into psychology\u2014I wanted to find out how it was that people, including myself, could be so easily deceived. In fact, this is one of the reasons why I am not as confrontational as Randi, because I actually see that \"but there for the grace of God go I.\" Skeptic: You were a newly minted Ph.D. in 1953 from Johns Hopkins University. Throughout the next decade, what were some of the things you investigated that led to the founding of the modern skeptical movement? Hyman: I was at Harvard for five years and there taught a class on con games, psychics, and so forth. Then I worked for three years in private industry, and after that I moved to the University of Oregon in 1961. I remember there was this lady in Russia who claimed she could read with her fingertips while blindfolded. An American woman who apparently could do the same thing was featured in Life magazine, and there was this American psychologist who was applying for grant money to study this woman in more detail. He wanted to figure out how she did it so he could train blind people to read this way. As a result, the National Institute of Health formed a committee to investigate her before they granted the funds, and they asked me to be on this committee. So we went to Flint, Michigan, where this lady lived, and we watched the psychologist test her. The procedure was that he had her put her hands into these sleeves, and these went into a box where the reading material was, so there was no way she could be doing the nose peek technique. He would put inside the box three plastic chips, two of one color, one of a different color, and she could supposedly tell which one was the odd colored chip. He had previously tested her over thousands of trials and she was highly significantly\u2014way above chance. Well, when we met the psychologist he was eager to convince us he was using very strict controls, and he wanted us to help him make sure he was doing everything right. But we told him to do exactly what he had always done so we could see if there were any flaws in the procedure. But he added additional controls to convince us how careful he was. Well, it turned out that when he added these controls to his procedure the lady was only at chance level. He started making excuses, and so forth, so I told him to let me try it. I did and I got 100% right! Skeptic: How did you do that? Hyman: I learned in my research that it is very important when investigating these sorts of claims that you see everything that is done before the actual test. I had been there all day observing the psychologist, and I noticed that when he put in a new set of chips, he put the odd chip down first! Skeptic: Obviously he didn't realize he was doing this. Hyman: No, and he was quite surprised that I was getting it right every time. So I explained what I was doing. We couldn't be sure that she was consciously doing this\u2014she might have unconsciously picked up the cue\u2014but obviously something like this was going on. Skeptic: Was this the start of the modern skeptical movement? Hyman: Actually Uri Geller gets credit for that. In December, 1972, I was sitting in my office grading final exams when I got a phone call from Austin Kibler, a Colonel at the defense department, who worked in what was then called the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense, set up by President Kennedy. It was sort of the Buck Rogers part of the defense department dealing with futuristic technologies. Kibler had a Ph.D. in psychology so we knew each other a little, so he called and said \"Ray, could you drop whatever you are doing and go on a mission for us to the Stanford Research Institute?\" I said, \"No, I'm grading exams.\" But he insisted. \"This is very important. There is this psychic down there. I know what you're thinking, but this guy is not like any other psychic you have ever seen. He can do anything most psychics can do, but he can also bend metal with his mind.\" I sounded incredulous, so Kibler responded, \"I don't necessarily believe, but I've watched him myself and let me tell you what he did. In a room of scientists, not just psychologists (he meant so-called \"real\" scientists like physicists!), he asked to borrow a ring. He said 'Don't let me touch it.' He didn't touch the ring, which was placed in the middle of a table. He concentrated on it and the ring stood on end, split, and shaped itself into the letter S.\" When I inquired more about it, it became clear that Kibler had not actually witnessed this himself, but had heard about it, and this was another lesson to me about what actually happens and what gets reported. So Kibler said he wanted to send a parapsychologist and me down there, along with someone from the Defense Department, to test this guy named Geller. His reasoning was that if he was a fake I would detect it, but if he was real it would take a parapsychologist to see it! And he wanted me to go right away because he said Geller was very volatile, very temperamental, and that at any moment he might just get up and leave. So he begged me to go and the next day I found myself in the presence of Uri Geller. And, frankly, I wasn't very impressed. But before I went down I called Martin Gardner because I had never heard of Geller, as had no one else in this country. He had never heard of him either. So I called Amos Tversky in Israel, because Geller was from Israel. He knew of Geller and said as far as he knew Geller was a charlatan and a trickster. He gave me some background about how Geller had worked the night clubs and stuff like that. Now, at that time Geller wasn't very good. He couldn't bend keys as well as Randi could, for example, but he got much better with practice. Skeptic: Did you figure out the ring effect? Hyman: Yes! When I got there they introduced me to Geller, who had already met with the parapsychologists Russell Targ and Harold Putoff, and they showed me records of some experiments they had done with Geller over the past week. I kept asking them about this ring effect. Turns out it was not a finger ring, like I thought, but these brass rings, and they showed me one that was twisted into a figure 8, and they said they measured the amount of pressure it would take to bend it by hand. So I asked them why they were talking about him bending it by hand, when he supposedly bent it with his mind. And they said, \"Oh, he can do it either way\"! So I said, \"did anyone actually see him bending this brass ring without touching it?\" It turns out that none of them had actually witnessed this great feat of mental metal bending. This whole story about how the brass ring got bent was from Geller himself! Geller told them he did this, and they just believed them. It was amazing. In fact, half the things I had heard about Geller, came from Geller himself, not from someone witnessing them. He would do something simple like bend a key using a standard magic effect, then say, \"Oh, don't count that, usually I can do this\" and he would hold up a key twisted in a cork-screw fashion. Then the parapsychologists would tell everyone they saw him bend the key like a corkscrew, instead of what they actually saw. It was unbelievable! Skeptic: So there was both deception and self-deception going on here. Hyman: It was part of their own folklore. When they would tell a story you were never sure if they had seen it or only heard about it. And when you pressed them it usually turned out that no one had ever witnessed Geller doing these amazing feats. One of my favorite places to find stories that turn into facts is in autobiographies. In the autobiography of the late psychologist Jean Piaget he tells the story that his earliest memory in life was being on a tram with his au pair who was taking him in a stroller to a park, as she usually did, when these men tried to kidnap him and she fought them off. Piaget said he always remembered that event. In his 60s or 70s, when he was writing his autobiography, he got a letter from this woman, saying how she felt guilty about something she wanted to get off her chest before she died. In this letter she told Piaget that this event never happened. It was a story she made up. Skeptic: It was a false memory! Hyman: Piaget explained that it had become part of the family lore and he had incorporated it as one of his memories. Skeptic: It's like when people see a magic trick they report seeing something very different from what actually happened. Hyman: The parapsychologists had no doubt that Geller was for real, but it was obvious to me what was going on. I then wrote a 13-page letter to Martin Gardner describing everything that happened with Geller (I always share these things with Martin because he is great at keeping confidences), but for some reason this 13-page letter became public. A mutual friend was visiting Martin and he saw the letter and, without telling Martin, photocopied it. Within a few weeks the letter had been distributed all over the place and it got back to SRI and they were threatening to sue me, and Time magazine wanted to quote it, and so forth. And in the midst of all this James Randi got hold of the letter, and that's how he got involved with Geller. The next month SRI took Geller to New York to visit Time magazine and other places to try to get some publicity for him, in order to generate research money from other sources because they knew my report for the Defense Department was not going to be positive. So Time contacted Randi who by now had my letter and brought him to New York as well. They disguised Randi as a reporter who was in the room when Geller was doing his routine. The Time article came out in February or March, 1973. This was the first big American story on Geller, called \"The Magician and the Think Tank.\" So Geller's first exposure in this country was a complete debunking. And he took off from there! Skeptic: It didn't faze him at all. Hyman: No, in fact, it launched him! About a year later Randi called me. We knew each other through Martin Gardner, but I didn't know him personally (we were both disciples of Martin, of sorts), and at the time he was traveling with the rock group Alice Cooper playing the role of a mad doctor. They came to Portland and I got a call from Randi to come up to see the show, and that Alice Cooper wanted to meet me. So we got to talking and Randi said he really wanted to do something about Geller. As a result of this conversation, Randi, Martin Gardner and I formed an informal group called SIR\u2014Scientists In Rationality\u2014an obvious play on the Stanford Research Institute. We started holding informal meetings, like at Martin's house, but none of us are administrators so there was a lot of talking but not much action. Then a sociologist at the University of Michigan named Marcello Truzzi heard about our group, and he contacted us and said he wanted to be a part of it. At that time Truzzi had a newsletter he called The Zetetic. It was simply a way of keeping academics informed about all this oddball stuff we were interested in, and he offered to do a newsletter for our group. So we took a look at a few issues and the three of us (Randi, Martin, and I) said \"Yeah, why not?\" At about this time, Paul Kurtz was working at the American Humanist Association. He had managed to triple the circulation of The Humanist, and he put together the anti-astrology statement that got a lot of attention. One day he and Truzzi were talking on an elevator and decided to form a group. They gave it that horrible name I can never remember, and no one else can remember\u2014The Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal\u2014 which our enemies call the \"PsiCops.\" Then,Truzzi brought Randi, Martin and me into the group. They decided to have the first organizational meeting in 1976, in conjunction with a Humanist meeting that was already taking place at the State University at Buffalo. For some reason, however, Truzzi neglected to put my name on the list, so I wasn't invited. Then, when they realized I was one of the original founders (along with Martin and Randi), they decided to invite me. I think Martin and Randi insisted on it. Everyone else had their way paid to the conference except me. And they refused to pay my expenses because they said I wasn't in the original plans. So even though I was one of the three original founders, I had to pay my own way to this meeting! Also there were Phil Klass and Dennis Rawlins, who would become founding members. Skeptic: This, then, was the founding of CSICOP and the Skeptical Inquirer? Hyman: Yes. Truzzi's The Zetetic newsletter was published two times the first year as a small-sized journal. The first issue dealt with the astrology controversy surrounding the so-called \"Mars Effect.\" Well, Rawlins and Truzzi didn't really get along all that well, and Rawlins thought Truzzi was a closet Satanist or something, so Rawlins left the group a few years later after the problems surrounding the handling of the Mars Effect controversy. Complicating matters, Truzzi wanted to make the publication an academic journal, giving all sides an equal chance to speak their mind on any given issue, but others in the group were afraid that this could lead to the journal being taken over by the other side. The controversy over the purpose and goals of the magazine, plus personal differences with Paul Kurtz, resulted in Truzzi's resigning as editor and leaving CSICOP. He was replaced by Ken Frazier, who was at that time an editor of Science News. Making matters worse, The Zetetic featured an article on Scientology. Shortly thereafter a Scientologist got hold of a CSICOP letterhead, wrote a bogus letter on it and sent it out to various people, making CSICOP really look like we were witch hunters and loose cannons. (We found all this out a few years later through the Freedom of Information Act.) Skeptic: What would it take to convince skeptics that there was such a thing as, say, psychic power? And here I am thinking of Alfred Wegener, who theorized about the possibility of continental drift in the 1920s, but it wasn't until the 1960s that the theory gained acceptance because it was not until then that the mechanism of plate tectonics was shown to be the driving force. In other words, evidence of continental drift alone was not enough. Scientists needed a mechanism to explain how it could happen before they accepted it. Is this the case with psychic power? Even if there were evidence, would we still demand a brain mechanism before accepting it? Hyman: That's right. I think of our research as a three-legged stool: - Theoretical underpinning; - Empirical evidence; and - Research program. Parapsychologists have a research program, but they have neither solid repeatable empirical evidence nor a theoretical underpinning. Another thing that bothers me is the idea of a financial challenge to psychics. Scientists don't settle issues with a single test, so even if someone does win a big cash prize in a demonstration, this isn't going to convince anyone. Proof in science happens through replication, not through single experiments. Randi understands this, and he is careful to say this, but it gets lost in the PR effort. But many in the scientific community worship Randi because they wish they could be him. They wish they didn't have the constraints of academia. He's out there in the trenches, on the front line, and they envy him for that. When I was involved in investigating the remote viewing experiments by the CIA, I had a similar discussion with Jessica Utts and Ed May, who wanted to know what it would take to convince me. I told them a story about a guy in St. Louis who said he could do remote viewing, but when we set up the experimental protocol he demanded that if the test came out positive I would say \"I now believe.\" I explained to him that \"belief\" is subjective, and I talked about how at magic conferences I have fooled even the best magicians in the world, and they have fooled me, so someday a psychic is going to come along and do something that I cannot explain, but this does not mean there is a real psychic effect here. It may just mean that I've been fooled. When I investigated the Ganzfeld experiments, for example, it took me three years to figure out what was going on. Skeptic: Are there some things you can partially explain but in which there is still an element of mystery? Hyman: Oh sure. In the CIA remote viewing experiments, for example, I can find some flaws, but their statistics look fine. This is not enough, however, to say that there is a real effect here. We have to wait and see if these experiments can be replicated. Dean Radin, in his book [The Conscious Universe](http://amzn.com/0061778990?tag=skepticcom20-20), took me to task for saying that I would never believe. Well, I didn't say that. I just explained that these very rare cases where there is some statistical anomaly do not prove a real psi effect. In Ed May's remote viewing experiments, for example, he discovered that when he was the judge he got much better results than his other judges did because, he said, he knows the peculiarities of the answers of the remote viewers whose answers were never very specific. So he could interpret them one way or the other. Skeptic: Did you make a conscious choice to become an academic scientist mainly interested in testing claims, rather than an activist out there debunking claims? Hyman: I discovered early on that by playing the scientific game I lost the PR game. As a scientist I have to qualify my answers, and this does not make for good PR or good sound bites. For example, when the CIA remote viewing experiments story broke and Nightline had a show on it, I was supposed to be on. When Ed May objected to my participation they got the head of the CIA instead. But he didn't really know the statistics or the research protocol. And even when I did do some shows on it, like Larry King Live, they mostly wanted to talk about the waste of taxpayer's money. They definitely did not want to talk about the data, the research methods, or the statistics. Skeptic: What does the future hold for skepticism? Hyman: Good scientific research is very costly and time consuming. Given limited resources, I think we get more bang for our buck if we focus on the media and education\u2014the opinion makers\u2014 instead of serious research. I think we need to be a credible source of reliable information. Frankly I think it is useless to offer cash prizes and debunk psychics on television. You can do that until doomsday. The public doesn't gain anything from this. I think we need to educate the public on the reason why these things appear real, on why we believe, on how we are deceived. These are epistemological questions. Most of us most of the time make decisions not on the basis of logic or science or rationality, but on emotion. Debunking without lessons is a waste of time. I like to tell the story of the 19th-century scientist Michael Faraday who took time out from his scientific research to investigate table turning and spiritualism. Members of Parliament were actually consulting these tables for advice, so Faraday proposed a test, not to debunk these spiritualists, who he believed to be sincere, but to see what was really going on. On a table he structured layers on layers on layers of table tops tied together with elastic bands, and down the side of them he put pencil marks. If they were pushing the table from the top, the pencil marks would leave broken hash marks down the side. He also put a reed on the side to see if it moved. When the spiritualists' eyes were opened, the reed did not move. When their eyes were closed, the reed and table moved! Faraday was actually conducting the very first biofeedback experiment. He showed not that these spiritualists were fakes, but that they were unconsciously moving the table themselves. They were self-deceiving. The purpose of this story is to show that, in my opinion, it is more interesting, and in the long run more important, to show unconscious bias than outright trickery. Obviously the latter is important in the short term\u2014we need to do both\u2014 but in the long term I want to learn something about the psychology of belief.

In this fascinating and illuminating work, Leonard Mlodinow guides us through the critical eras and events in the development of science, all of which were propelled forward by humankind's collective struggle to know. From the birth of reasoning and culture to the formation of the studies of physics, chemistry, biology, and modern-day quantum physics, we come to see that much of our progress can be attributed to simple questions\u2014why? how?\u2014bravely asked. Mlodinow shows that just as science has played a key role in shaping the patterns of human thought, human subjectivity has played a key role in the evolution of science. At once authoritative and accessible, and infused with the author's trademark wit, this deeply insightful book is a stunning tribute to humanity's intellectual curiosity.

DIALOGUE ON THE NATURE OF SCIENCE Rupert Sheldrake & Michael Shermer Through the months of May, June, and July of 2015, TheBestSchools.org is hosting [an intensive dialogue on the nature of science](http://www.thebestschools.org/special/sheldrake-shermer-dialogue-nature-of-science/) between [Rupert Sheldrake](http://www.thebestschools.org/features/rupert-sheldrake-interview/) and [Michael Shermer](http://www.thebestschools.org/features/michael-shermer-interview/). This first month, the focus is on \" [Materialism in Science](http://www.thebestschools.org/sheldrake-shermer-materialism-in-science-opening-statements/).\" Dr. Sheldrake will defend that science needs to free itself from materialist dogma; indeed, science misunderstands nature by being wedded to purely materialist explanations. By contrast, Dr. Shermer will defend that science, properly conceived, is a materialistic enterprise; for science to look beyond materialist explanations is to betray science and engage in superstition. Interviews To give readers context for this dialogue, Drs. Sheldrake and Shermer graciously provided the following interviews: Attend the Live Recording of Skepticality's 10th Anniversary Episode in Atlanta!

About this week's eSkeptic In this week's eSkeptic, Russell Friedman\u2014skeptic, colleague, and friend of Michael Shermer\u2014writes in response to [Shermer's article](https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/15-04-29/#feature) on the gay rights revolution. Friedman recounts his experience opening the first gay bar in Los Angeles with windows that faced the street, a big deal at the time as gays were still in the closet and all such public venues were hidden to the public and you had to know where to go to get in. Russell Friedman is executive director of [The Grief Recovery Institute Educational Foundation](http://www.griefrecoverymethod.com/) and co-author of [The Grief Recovery Handbook](http://amzn.com/0061686077?tag=skepticcom20-20), [When Children Grieve](http://amzn.com/0060084294?tag=skepticcom20-20), and [The Grief Recovery Handbook for Pet Loss](http://amzn.com/1630760145?tag=skepticcom20-20). From Stonewall to Indiana with a stop-over in West Hollywood by Russell Friedman In the April 29 issue of eSkeptic Michael Shermer wrote an [article](https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/15-04-29/#feature) (which [also appeared](https://moralarc.org/collision-between-religious-freedom-and-gay-rights/) in his Moral Arc Blog) entitled \"From Stonewall to Indiana: The Collision Between Religious Freedom and Gay Rights.\" Reading this was a trip down memory lane for me. Like so many people, after a difficult childhood I struggled to find my own identity, and then had to fight to maintain it in a cookie-cutter world that wants to fit people into convenient, easy-to-label boxes. Although I had managed to graduate college, I had no profession and even less idea of what I might want to do with my life. I moved to New York because that's what you did back in 1964 to seek your fame and fortune. Not having a trade to ply, I wound up working in a restaurant called The Proof of the Pudding. Although I really enjoyed working in that restaurant, I never adapted to life in New York. A year later, on impulse, I picked up and moved to London. I managed to get a legal work permit from the Home Office there and started at the ground floor as a busboy in a hotel restaurant. Over time I worked my way up to headwaiter and became even more convinced that I'd found what would be my life's work. After my stint in the hotel restaurant, which earned me the UK equivalent of a Green Card, I was hired to run a wild and crazy Russian Bistro called the Borshtch N Tears, which is still there at 46 Beauchamp Place, a few blocks from Harrods. One of my co-workers at the restaurant, an older woman named Tan, told me her daughter was coming back from the Sorbonne in Paris because of the student riots. She asked me if I'd like to meet her. I said yes. I met Vivienne on Sunday. We got married on Tuesday, two days later, at the Chelsea Town Hall on King's Road in London. It was very romantic, and illustrates that I march to my own drum. As much as I enjoyed the restaurant part of my life in London, I didn't feel entirely at home in London. So a few months after Viv and I got married, we packed up our meager possessions and moved to Los Angeles, West Hollywood to be exact. It was 1968 and West Hollywood had not yet taken on the sobriquet as a Gay City. Gay was not entirely out of the closet yet; gay men were constantly being arrested at the park on San Vicente; and the idea of formal gay marriage wasn't even on the horizon. But the population, especially in the area between La Cienega on the East, and Doheny on the West was predominantly gay. The other major population groups were recent Russian immigrants and senior citizens. While there were occasional flare-ups between those groups, in the main there was a benign co-existence. West Hollywood was a true \"live and let live\" community, and for me, having struggled to find who I was and how to fit in, it was the perfect place. And it was here that I opened the first gay bar in Los Angeles with open windows to the street. Here is how it happened. At that time, when gay was still mainly in the closet, most gay bars were like pill boxes, hidden on side streets with no windows on the world. You had to know where they were to find them. San Francisco was already wide open, but LA lagged behind. In 1970 Vivienne and I opened our restaurant, The Taming of the Stew. Two years later we changed the name to Lost on Larrabee. Larrabee was, and still is, a very short street, starting at Santa Monica Blvd. and only going a few blocks north to just above Sunset Blvd\u2014thus the name. After Viv and I divorced, my heart just wasn't in the restaurant business any more. Essentially it was a mom and pop place, and mom was gone. In 1977, I closed the restaurant and made one of my former employees\u2014who was gay\u2014a business partner, and turned the restaurant into a gay bar called Rascals. The place was an instant success. On opening night, Wayland Flowers entertained the throng with his famous puppet character, Madame. (If you've never seen Wayland and Madame, [treat yourself](http://bit.ly/1K8PLyD). Not long after we opened the bar I became the first president of the Tavern Guild of LA, which was an association of gay bar owners. I was the only straight member of the Guild. Here's a description written by a man who worked for us: Rascals was the first gay bar in West Hollywood to have huge windows looking out onto the street. We were also the first to have an obvious entrance facing the street. Most the bars at the time had entrances at the back or very unassuming doors at the front that were always kept shut. We were open to the street and proud of it. The bar was a huge success and started the move for bars to come out of the dark. We can thank Stonewall for the strength to do that. The naming of the bar was also a quirky story. For the life of us, my partner, Larry, and I couldn't come up with a name. We were buying the Racing Form every day and scanning all the horse's names, looking for one to hit us. In the meantime, the graphic designer who was going to create our logo and signage was getting nervous since it was less than two weeks until our opening night and we still didn't have a name. One late afternoon I got home and my daughter, who was then about 8 years old, yelled to her mother, \"Mom, Ruscal the Rascal is home.\" I tore out of the house, jumped into my car and raced to Larry's house. I ran in and said \"Rascals!\" And there it was, the perfect name. So the first gay bar in LA with open windows to the street was named by an 8-year old girl. Another story that really ties into The Moral Arc elements: The parents of my new wife, Jeanne, came to visit us. They were very Catholic, and my mother-in-law was the ultimate church-lady. I was concerned that she would want to see her daughter's business, and that she would take offense at what she saw. On the dreaded night that we took them to Rascals, we entered through the kitchen and came up to the end of the 60-foot long bar. The room was filled to the rafters with 200 plus young men, in tank tops and tight shirts, all model good-looking and awash in testosterone. The music was blasting out of massive 8-foot tall speakers. Although technically there was no dancing, the room was swaying as if one body to the disco beat. My mother-in-law took in the scene, with me watching like a hawk to see her reaction. All of a sudden I realized that she was no longer looking at the sea of young men, with almost no women in sight. She was focused on the bar and the four bartenders who were slinging out drinks and raking in the cash. In a flash, her eyes turned into dollar signs and I could read her mind. It was saying, \"my daughter's getting rich.\" That visit turned out great, with never a negative word spoken about our customers. I have many fond memories from back in the day, but some sad ones too\u2014my business partner, and everyone else who worked for us, died from AIDS. But as I watch the gay rights revolution unfold at warp speed today, I realize how brave they were back then to come out into a world that didn't understand their brand of normal. I am proud to have been a small part of the live and let live world that we must keep encouraging.

According to evolutionary biologist Beth Shapiro, the science says yes. From deciding which species should be restored, to sequencing their genomes, to anticipating how revived populations might be overseen in the wild, Shapiro vividly explores the extraordinary cutting-edge science that is being used to resurrect the past. Journeying to far-flung Siberian locales in search of ice age bones and delving into her own research and that of others, Shapiro considers de-extinction's practical benefits and ethical challenges. Would de-extinction change the way we live? Is this really cloning? What are the costs and risks? And what "}
