An Open -Door Enrollment Admissions policy means that any student with a high school diploma or GED certificate can attend. With guaranteed acceptance, open admissions policies are all about access and opportunity: any student who has completed high schoo l has the option of pursuing a college degree. Although the University follows an open- door admissions policy, there will be no compromise with academic standards. Open Enrollment Admission colleges do not require SAT or ACT test scores, but students are expected to take a diagnostic test upon admission to test their competency. The test will be used to determine whether students will be required to take remedial or developmental coursework before being allowed to take college level courses. The open admission s policy does not mean that specific programs cannot have selective admissions processes . It does mean that these restrictions are flexible enough to allow students opportunities to improve their educational status by eliminating deficiencies through remedial work. New students seeking admission to a specific program must provide appropriate transcripts and participate in placement asse ssment to meet prerequisi te/corequisite requirements . When new students are able to meet the specific admission requirements for a given program , they may enroll and remain in the program as long as they make satisfactory progress and remain enrolled on a continuous basis as required by the program . Admission Procedures Applications for admission are processed under a policy of continuous admissions. They are initiated at the Admissions Office. An admissions representative, the registrar, and the financial aid officer interview the applicant to discuss student career goals, program schedules, costs, required documents, placement or diagnostic tests as applicable, and eligibility for financial assistance. These interviews conclude with the signing of the Enrollment Application, a contract that covers all obligations between FNU and the student. Types o f Institutional Exams 1.

Graduate Certificates: Graduate Certification courses are drawn from the MBA program and are transferable (within five years) to graduates with a grade average of B or higher and meet the MBA admission requirements outlined in the FNU Catalog. FNU reserves the right to choose the credentialing institutions it recognizes. The procedure for transferability of credits to FNU is as follows: 45 Revised April 2021 1. The applicant submits an original transcript of his/her courses from the previous institution(s) at the ti me of registration or within the student's first semester of enrollment. 2. The Campus Registrar will render an interim evaluation of the transcript. A copy will be uploaded to CampusNexus system. 3. The University Registrar or the Vice -President of Acade mics will give the final approval to the transfer credits. 4. This final evaluation will be uploaded in the system and a notification will be sent to the Office of Financial Aid for computation. Grade point averages are not transferred; but courses transferred will appear on the student's transcripts with their respective/earned grades. Transfer credits are granted only for those courses in which a grade of \"C\" or better was earned. Criteria for transferring credits from an A.A. or A.S. degree program awarded at FNU to a baccalaureate program are discussed in the section Transferred Credits . For internal transferability from one program to another program, the student must satisfactorily pass at least 25% of the credits corresponding with the new career to graduate. FNU accept s credits from regionally accredited institutions that are applicable to the applicant's program of study. FNU will accept credits from non- regionally accredited institutions for courses that are substantially equivalent in c ontent to FNU's courses and applicable to the applicant's program and evaluated on a course -by-course basis. The acceptance of classes from non- regionally accredited institutions is contingent upon appropriate faculty credentials and applicable course content to the degree program . Additionally, FNU accepts transfer credits from nationally accredited institutions that participate in the Florida Statewide Course Numbering System. Credits from international institutions will be evaluated and granted on course equivalency basis. The transcript must be translated into English and evaluated by an authorized educational evaluations and translations agency. Credit is not awarded for developmental, preparatory, or vocational coursework. Credit will be awarded for CLEP and AP test scores in compliance with FNU's policy on these tests. Credit will be awarded for DANTES test programs in accordance with the recommendations of the American Council on Education. A maximum of 15 credits will be accepted from test scores. The credits must be earned before the student is enrolled or within the first two semesters. Credit will be accepted from U.S. military service schools in accordance with the recommendations of the American Council on Education (ACE). 46 Revised April 2021 Credit for Experient ial Learning (prior college -level learning attained outside a formal institution setting) will be evaluated and assessed according to the FNU procedures for acceptance and equivalency of Experiential Learning credits. 47 Revised April 2021 Financial Information Tuition a nd Fe es Tuition is subject to change without prior notification. Tuition charges do not include other fees such as textbooks and supplies, registration fee, Laboratory fee, etc. Registration fee is charged at the beginning of the program. Note: IAW DoDI 1322.25, any changes in the \"tuition\" charges will be provided to and explained to all Military Service Components, as soon as possible, but not fewer than 90 days prior to implementation. Registration Fee All registration charges must be paid prior to the sig ning of the Enrollment Application. The registration fee is non-refundable. Payment o f Institutional Charges Satisfactory arrangements for tuition and fee payment must be made upon admission to Florida National University. A student who qualifies for financial aid assistance might meet his/her obligations through an electronic disbursement of federal (Title IV) financial aid. Any remaining balance not paid by financial aid assistance will be equally distributed throughout the normal length of the student's program, with each payment being due by the fifth (5th) day of each month (extended to ten (10) days without penalty). A late fee of 5% will be added to each monthly tuition payment from the eleventh (11) day of the month. The first monthly payment is due upon enrollment. Failing to meet any one -month payment may result in an administrative termination from the University. It is the student's responsibility to provide all required documentation on time and verify that his/ her financial account is being correctly processed. An advance payment for the first semester will be required from international students who enroll with an F -1 (student) visa. Release of Diploma a nd Official Transcripts A student who is delinquent in meeting her or his financial obligations will not be issued an academic transcript, degree, diploma, or other evidence of course completion. In addition, any amount owed to FNU upon completion of a student's program or withd rawal from the University must be paid in full before a student's diploma or official transcript can be released. Any non -financial outstanding holds on a student's account also must be resolved before a diploma or official transcript can be released. 48 Revised April 2021 If a student's balance is not paid in full at the time the student would otherwise be scheduled to graduate, the student will not receive his/her final transcripts or diploma until final payment is made. However, if the graduate or withdrawn student has a remaining balance that is being paid consistently and on time, the institution will provide directly to employers or other institutions copies of the tra nscript or diploma as needed. If a student pays his/her account balance with a check, it may take up to 21 days for the hold on their account to clear. (Students should speak with the Bursar's Office to see if their check can be cleared instantly.) Return o f Title IV Funds This Return of Title IV Funds policy (\"Policy\") applies to students who complete 60 percent or less of the payment period (i.e., Fall, Spring or Summer session) for which they received Federal Title IV aid. A student who does not complete all of the days in the payment period that the student was scheduled to complete is considered a withdrawal. To comply with the Policy, Florida National University (FNU) must first determine the student's withdrawal date. The withdrawal date is determined in accordance with FNU's Drop Procedure, and is based on the following: 1. For a student who leave s without notifying the institution (an unofficial withdrawal), the later of the midpoint of the payment period, the last date of an academically -related activity (if documented) or the census date*; or 2. For a student who notifies the institution of the student's withdrawal, the earlier of the date the student began the withdrawal process or officially notified FNU by contacting the Registrar's Office either orally or in writing of his/her intent to withdraw (an official withdrawal). * Exceptions: (1) I f a student does not receive an earned grade (A - F) in at least one of the courses the student was scheduled to attend during a semester, FNU will assume an unofficial withdrawal has occurred (see Drop Procedure for additional detail). (2) If a student withdraws or is terminated when enrolled only in courses in which attendance - taking is required, special treatment is required (see below). The Return of Title IV funds calculation determines a student's earned and unearned Title IV aid based on the percentage of the payment period completed by the student. The amount of as sistance earned is determined on a pro -rata basis. For example, if a student completes 30 percent of the payment period, the student earns 30 percent of the assistance the student was originally scheduled to receive. Once a student completes more than 60 percent of the payment period, the student earns all of the assistance he/she was scheduled to receive for the payment period. The percentage of the payment period that the student completes is derived by dividing the number of calendar days the student attended up to the withdrawal date by the number of calendar days in the payment period. Calendar days (including weekends) are counted, but breaks of at least 5 days are excluded from both the numerator and denominator. 49 Revised April 2021 If a student has not received all o f the Title IV earned, the student may be eligible for a post-withdrawal disbursement. If the post- withdrawal disbursement includes Direct Loan funds, FNU must seek the student's permission before it can disburse the loan funds. The student may decline all or a portion of the Direct Loan funds. FNU may automatically use all or a portion of a post- withdrawal disbursement of grant funds for tuition and fees and other institutional charges, if the student has provided an authorization for this purpose. There are some types of Title IV funds that a student may have been scheduled to receive that cannot be disbursed to the student upon his/her withdrawal. For example, a first- time, first -year undergraduate student who has not completed the first 30 days of the program before withdrawing cannot receive any Direct Loan funds. If the student earned less Title IV aid than the amount of funds disbursed on the student's account, FNU must return a portion of the excess Title IV funds equal to the lesser of: 1. The applicable institutional charges multiplied by the unearned percentage of the Title IV funds; or 2. The entire amount of excess Title IV funds. FNU will return the Title IV funds in the following order: Unsubsidized Direct Loan, Subsidized Direct Loans, PLUS (P arent) loans, Federal Pell Grants, and Federal SEOG (Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant), within 45 days of the date of determination. The student may also be required to return Title IV funds based on the Return of Title IV Funds calculat ion. A student returns funds to the Federal Direct Loan programs based on the terms and conditions of the Master Promissory Note. Any amount of unearned grant funds that a student must return is considered an \"overpayment.\" A student who receives a Federal Pell Grant or FSEOG funds may be required to repay any overpayment to the extent it exceeds 50% of the amount of grant funds the student received or could have received. A student does not have to repay a grant overpayment of $50 or less. Earned Title I V aid is not related in any way to institutional charges. Therefore, the College's refund policy and Return of Title IV Funds procedures are independent of one another. A student who withdraws from FNU, may be required to return unearned aid and still owe the University for their institutional charges. For more information on the FNU withdrawal and institutional charges policies, please consult the University catalog. Students Enrolled in Only Attendance- Taking Courses In certain courses, attendance taking is required and, therefore, must be tracked on an ongoing basis (referred to as \"attendance -taking courses\"). This applies primarily to student clinical rotations, externships, and similar courses in which the number of completed hours is required to be tracked. During periods when a student is enrolled in only attendance taking courses, the student's withdrawal date for purposes of this Policy is the student's last date of academic attendance as determined by the institution from its attendance r ecords. In this case, FNU will determine that a student has withdrawn within 14 calendar days of the student's last 50 Revised April 2021 date of attendance as determined by the attendance records of the institution, and will complete the return of Title IV funds calculation and return any unearned funds within 45 calendar days of the date of such determination. If a student is enrolled in both attendance -taking courses and non- attendance -taking courses at the same time, this section does not apply. How to Handle an Overpayment? Students who owe funds to a grant program are required to make payment of those funds within 45 days of being notified by FNU that they owe this overpayment. During the 45 - day period students will remain eligible for Title IV funds. If no positive action is taken by the student within 45 days of being notified, FNU will notify the U.S. Department of Education of the student's overpayment situation. The student will no longer be eligible for Title IV funds until they enter into a satisfactory repayment agreement with the U.S. Department of Education or pay the overpayment in full. During the 45 -day period, the student can make full payment to FNU of the overpayment. The University will forward the payment to the U.S. Department of Education and the student will remain eligible for Title IV funds. Please make check payable to Florida National University. If a student is unable to pay their overpayment in full, they can set up a repayment plan with the U.S. Department of Education. Before doing this please c ontact the FNU's Financial Aid Office. You will need to make sure we have referred your situation to the U.S. Department of Education before any repayment plan can be set up. If you want to contact the U.S. Department of Education, their address is listed below. U.S. Department of Education Student Financial Assistance Programs P.O. Box 4222 Iowa City, IA 52245 Phone: 1 -800-621-3115 E -Mail: DCS_HELP@ed.gov For examples of the Return of Title IV Funds calculations or questions regarding the overpayment po licy, please contact the Financial Aid Office. Refund Policy Should a student be terminated, withdraw, or cancel for any reason, all refunds will be made according to the following refund schedule: 1. If the university does not accept the enrollment, all monies paid by the student to the university shall be refunded and the student and university shall be released from further obligation. 2. Cancellation by the third (3rd) business day after the student signs his or her enrollment agreement will result in a cancellation of any obligation to the university, except any assessment for supplies, materials and kits that are not returned or are not returnable because of use. 51 Revised April 2021 3.

There is no refund due if the student is terminated or withdraws after the Add - Drop period. 7. If a student is withdrawn from a class due to a class cancellation, the student is entitled to a full refund. Refund Policy f or Military Student s This policy only applies to students receiving Military Tuition Assistance (TA). As a DoD MOU signatory, the University is required to return some or all of the TA awarded to you if you did not complete at least 60 percent of each individual course, possibly creating a debt balance on your account. TA is awarded under the premise that you will attend class for the entire period for which the assistance is awarded. If you withdraw or are dismissed, you may no longer be eligible for the full amount of TA f unds originally awarded. The University will return any unearned TA funds on a proportional basis through at least the 60 percent point of the period for which the funds were provided; unearned funds returned are based upon your last date of attendance (LD A) week. Military Leave of Absence (MLOA) clause: If you must stop attending due to a military service obligation, notify the University, and the University will work with you to identify solutions that will not result in a debt balance for the returned portion. Calculation: Determining eligibility for TA is individual course specific. When you officially withdraw or are dismissed from a course, the University will determine the LDA by identifying the last date of activity within a course. **LDA formula: days compl eted (LDA) divided by the length (days) of the term. Note: **Days within the Spring & winter recess are not counted toward the term period. With the LDA determined, the University will recalculate your TA eligibility based on the LDA formula and refund the percentage identified for the week in which your LDA occurred. 52 Revised April 2021 Return of Funds/Tuition Refund Chart: Prior to the first day of the term 100% tuition refund. With attendance posted after the first day of the term, TA will be prorated/refunded in accordance with below charts: 8-week Term Return of TA% TA% Earned During week 1 90% 10% During week 2 75% 25% During week 3 60% 40% During week 4 50% 50% During week 5 40% 60% During week 6 -8 0% 100% **Attendance greater than 60% is considered fully earned tuition for that term, and no refund will be given. 16-week Term Return of TA% TA% Earned During week 1 90% 10% During week -3 80% 20% During 70% 30% 40% 60% During week 10 -16 0% 100% Refund Policy for VA Students The university does not calculate unused tuition and fee portions, the university will report the withdrawal date (LDA - last date of attendance) and action to the VA (within VAONCE) and the VA then calculates the percentage of refund owed, either by the school and/or the student. Notifications are issued in the form of a debt letter. 53 Revised April 2021 Student Tuition Recovery Fund (STRF) (California Distance Students) The following provisions are set forth as an addendum to the current Florida National University Catalog and apply to any student who resides in the State of California and enrolls in a distance education program at the University. The State of California established the Student Tuition Recovery Fund (STRF) to relieve or mitigate economic loss suffered by a student in an educational program at a qualifying institution, who is or was a Cal ifornia resident while enrolled, or was enrolled in a residency program, if the student enrolled in the institution, prepaid tuition, and suffered an economic loss. Unless relieved of the obligation to do so, you must pay the state - imposed assessment for the STRF, or it must be paid on your behalf, if you are a student in an educational program, who is a California resident, or are enrolled in a residency program, and prepay all or part of your tuition. You are not eligible for protection from the STRF and you are not required to pay the STRF assessment, if you are not a California resident, or are not enrolled in a residency program. It is important that you keep copies of your enrollment agreement, financial aid documents, receipts, or any other informatio n that documents the amount paid to the school. Questions regarding the STRF may be directed to the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education, 2535 Capitol Oaks Drive, Suite 400, Sacramento, CA 95833, (916) 431 -6959 or (888) 370 -7589. To be eligible for S TRF, you must be a California resident or enrolled in a residency program, prepaid tuition, paid or deemed to have paid the STRF assessment, and suffered an economic loss as a result of any of the following: 1.

The institution has been ordered to pay a refund by the Bureau but has failed to do so. 5. The institution has failed to pay or reimburse loan proceeds under a federal student loan program as required by law, or has failed to pay or reimburse proceeds received by the institution in excess of tuition and other costs. 6. You have been awarded restitution, a refund, or other monetary award by an arbitrator or court, based on a violation of this chapter by an institution or representative of an institution, but have been unable to collect the award from the institution. 7. You sought legal counsel that resulted in the cancellation of one or more of your student loans and have an invoice for services rendered and evidence of the cancellation of the student loan or loans. To qualify for STRF reimbursement, the application must be received within four (4) years from the date of the action or event that made the student el igible for recovery from STRF. A student whose loan is revived by a loan holder or debt collector after a period of noncollection may, at any time, file a written application for recovery from STRF for the debt that would have otherwise been eligible for recovery. If it has been more than four (4) years since the action or event that made the student eligible, the student must have filed a written application for recovery within the original four (4) year period, unless the period has been extended by another act of law. However, no claim can be paid to any student without a social security number or a taxpayer identification number. 55 Revised April 2021 Financial Assistance Florida National University is committed to assisting its students in meeting university expenses throug h federal aid, if the student qualifies, and/or other methods such as loans or deferred payment plans.

Under this program, the U.S. Department of Education is your lender . There are four types of Direct Loans available: Direct Subsidized Loans are loans made to eligible undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need to help cover the costs of higher education at a college or career school. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are loans made to eligible undergraduate, graduate, and professional students, but eligibility is not based on financial need. Direct PLUS Loans are loans made to graduate or professional students and parents of dependent undergraduate students to help pay for education expenses not covered by other financial aid. Eligibility is not based on financial need, but a credit check is required. Borrowers who have an adverse credit history must meet additional requirements to qualify. Direct Consolidation Loans allow you to combine all of your eligible federal student loans into a single loan with a single loan servicer . Interest Rate for Direct Loan (https://studentaid.gov/understand- aid/types/loans/interest- rates#what- interest ) Interest is paid to a lender as a cost of borrowing money. Interest is calculated as a percentage of the unpaid principal amount. Unlike other forms of debt, such as credit cards and mortgages, Direct Loans are daily interest loans, which means that interest accrues (accumulates) daily. Depending on whether your loans are subsidized or unsubsidized, you may or may not be responsible for paying the interest that accrues during all periods. The interest rate varies depending on the loan type and (for most types of federal student loans) the first disbursement date of the loan. Table 2 below provides interest rates for Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Direct PLUS Loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2019, and before July 1, 2020. 58 Revised April 2021 Table 2 - Interest Rates for Direct Loans First Disbursed on or After July 1, 2019, and Before July 1, 2020 Loan Type Borrower Type Fixed Interest Rate Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans Undergraduate 4.53% Direct Unsubsidized Loans Graduate or Professional 6.08% Direct PLUS Loans Parents and Graduate or Professional Students 7.08% All interest rates shown in the chart above are fixed rates that will not change for the life of the loan.

The purpose of this counseling is to emphasize the student's rights and responsibilities as a first-time borrower Exit Counseling Exit counseling provides important information to prepare you to repay your federal student loan(s). If you have received a subsidized, unsubsidized, or PLUS loan under the Direct Loan Program or the FFEL Program, you must complete exit counseling each time you: Drop below half-time enrollment Graduate Leave school Student Loan Repayment To make your payments more affordable, repayment plans can give you more time to repay your loans or can be based on your income.

The formula used to determine the Estimated Family Contribution (EFC ) is too long to be included in this catalog. However, a pamphlet that describes the formula in detail can be obtained by writing to Federal Student Aid, P.O. Box 84, Washington, DC, 20044. 3. Demonstrate financial need. The Department of Education mails an Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) directly to the student, which the student submits to FNU, even if there is no award. 4. Be a high school graduate or hold a GED diploma. The amount of the award is determined by the Estimated Family Co ntribution (EFC), which is reported in the ISIR. 5.

The Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504) prohibit discrimination against individuals with disabilities. FNU does not discriminate on the basis of disability in admissions or employment, in providing access to its programs and activities, or in the treatment of its students and employees, in accordance with the ADA and Section 504. No qualified student with a disability will, on the basis of their disability, be subject to discrimination or excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of FNU's programs and activities. FNU operates its programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate. In accordance with the ADA and S ection 504, FNU provides appropriate academic and other adjustments and aids (referred to in this policy as reasonable accommodations) for qualified students with disabilities. The following sections outline the process for requesting and receiving approp riate reasonable accommodations. Relevant definitions appear at the end of this policy. Accessibility Coordinators Contact Information The University has designated the following persons to coordinate its efforts under this policy. Accessibility Coordin ator Name Dr. Anthony Berrios Title VP of Academic Affairs Contact Info (305) 821 -3333 Ext. 1163 Location JR Building Office 502E Email aberrios@fnu.edu Accommodation requests and supporting documentation may be submitted in person at the Student Services Office of any campus. Documents submitted in person should be placed in a sealed envelope and marked confidential. Students are strongly encouraged to submit their documentation in person. If you are unable to submit your documentation in person, you may submit your documents by utilizing your FNU student email . Students should follow up via phone call or an additional email to ensure that documents se nt 94 Revised April 2021 electronically were received by an accessibility coordinator. See below for additional information. Process for Seeking Accommodation Step 1: Self -Identification; Documentation In accordance with federal guidelines, FNU requires that a student seeking an academic accommodation(s) self -identify, and provide a formal written request for accommodation, supported by diagnostic and medical evidence. Disclosure of a disability is voluntary. Students do not need to self -identify as having a disability if they are not seeking academic accommodations or assignment to accessible facilities. Students who are seeking accommodations, however, should start the process as early in their academic journey as possible. Students who believe they are in need of an accommodation should review the Disability Accommodation Documentation Guidelines and present a completed Disability Accommodation Request Form (including the required supporting documentation) to an Accessibility Coordinator. The Disability Accommodation Documentation Guidelines and Request Form can be found at: https://www.fnu.edu/wp -content/uploads/2019/07/FNU -Disability -Request -form- D0843675 -3.pdf. Part 1 of the Disability Accommodation Request Form should be completed by the student, and Part 2 should be completed by the student's treating or diagnosing professional. Accommodation requests and supporting documentation may be submitted in person at the Student Services Office of any campus, or directly to an accessibility coordinator. Documents submitted in person should be placed in a sealed envelope and marked confidential. Students are strongly encouraged to submit their documentation in person. If you are unable to submit your documentation in person, you may submit your documents by utilizing your FNU student email directly to an accessibility coordinator. Students should follow up via phone call or an additional email to ensure that documents sent electronically were received by the accessibility coordinator. Please refer to the Disability Accommodation Documentation Guidelines for more information about appropriate documentation. Students are welcome to contact an Accessibility Coordinator either before or after submitting the required information. The Accessibility Coordinator can guide the student through filling out the required forms and can advise on what supporting documentation may be required. Once th e student completes the required forms and collects the supporting documentation, the file is verified for completeness by an Accessibility Coordinator. Students should not self-identify to any faculty or staff other than the designated Accessibility Coo rdinators. Faculty are required to include in every syllabus specific information that directs students who may require accommodations to the appropriate 95 Revised April 2021 university officials. At no time are faculty, program directors, staff, or division heads permitted to provide accommodations to any student outside of this policy. All faculty are required to provide officially granted academic accommodations, without modification. Step 2: Determination An Accessibility Coordinator will review the requested accommodation(s) to determine if the accommodation(s) are properly documented and supported by a qualified professional who is treating or diagnosing the student. Additional or updated documentation may be required if the provided documentation does not demonstrate the existence of a qualifying disability and its potential impact on the student in our academic environment, or does not identify recommended accommodation(s). If additional documentation is needed, the student will be informed in a timely manner. Pleas e refer to the Disability Accommodation Documentation Guidelines for more information. Where additional or updated supporting documentation is needed, the Accessibility Coordinator may work with students to provide accommodations on a temporary, time - limited basis while such additional or updated documentation is being obtained. Any such temporary accommodations should not be construed to be necessary, required, or ongoing. There is no obligation for FNU to provide such temporary accommodations, and they do not obligate the University to provide permanent academic accommodations. Step 3: Nature of Accommodations; Notification Appropriate accommodations will be determined based on the student's disability and individual needs. Accommodations may include auxiliary aids and services, as well as modifications to academic requirements as necessary to ensure equal educational opportunity. Each request for accommodations is reviewed on a case -by-case basis. Students with the same diagnosis may receive different accommodations depending on the specific circumstances applicable to them. A reasonable accommodation does not include an accommodation that would impose an undue financial or administrative burden, or that would require the University to fundamentally alter its academic programs or lower or substantially modify essential requirements . Additional details can be found in the definition of Reasonable Accommodation, below. The Accessibility Coordinator(s) will provide an official letter detailing the accommodations that are approved for the student. The official letter will not include any medical information and will only deta il the approved accommodations. For each course in which the student wants the approved accommodations to be utilized, the student must provide the faculty the letter that details the approved accommodations. Students are advised that they are not required to disclose any details regarding their disability to any faculty member. Faculty members may verify the approved accommodations by contacting an Accessibility Coordinator. In the event the requested academic accommodation(s) are denied (in whole or i n part), the Accessibility Coordinator will provide a rationale for the denial. Students should 96 Revised April 2021 expect an interactive process to identify appropriate accommodations. Where a student's preferred accommodation is denied because it would result in a fundame ntal alteration or undue financial or administrative burden, the University will seek to provide an alternative accommodation, if available. Step 4: Ongoing Review; Changes to Program FNU maintains an ongoing dialogue with students requesting and receiving accommodations. Students should remain in contact with an Accessibility Coordinator. Should the student's needs change, and/or they wish to request additional or different accommodations, they are encouraged to contact an Accessibility Coordinator. Students contemplating changing their program should consult with the Accessibility Coordinator as early as possible. Because the availability of certain academic accommodations depends on a student's program of enrollment, students changing educational prog rams (including advancing to a new degree level) must submit a new request in order to reestablish their accommodation(s) for the new program and may be required to obtain new documentation. However, this process will be streamlined to the extent possible . Confidentiality FNU seeks to maintain the confidentiality of all requests for accommodations but reserves the right to consult FNU officials regarding the appropriateness of accommodations and how best to implement specific accommodations. Consulted of ficials may include a programmatic supervisor who can advise on how best to manage an accommodation within a specific course or program of study. At no time will faculty be provided medical information regarding the student. Faculty may not share medical or accommodation information with others, including fellow faculty members. In all consultations, the student's rights to privacy under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and other applicable laws and regulations will be maintained. The Accessibility Coordinators will be tasked with maintaining all the files regarding requests for accommodations. As these files will contain confidential medical information, the files will be stored in a secured location, that is not accessible by othe rs. Accommodations Grievance Procedures & Request Resubmission Enrolled and former students wishing to file a complaint or grievance relating to the University's compliance with the ADA or Section 504, or who feel that an appropriate accommodation has not been approved or is not being adequately provided, are encouraged to notify an Accessibility Coordinator, and seek an informal resolution. Enrolled and former students may also submit a formal complaint or grievance to the University, which wil l be processed i n accordance with the University's general complaint and grievance p rocedures. Students should refer to the Student Handbook and University Catalog for additional information. These grievance procedures do not apply to applicants for admission. 97 Revised April 2021 In addition, if accommodati ons are denied, the student may resubmit a request for accommodation based on updated or additional documentation and/or evaluation from their qualified licensed or credentialed professional. The updated or additional material will be reviewed by the Acce ssibility Coordinator as described above. It is the student's responsibility to seek additional documentation and/or evaluation. Definitions \"Disability\" refers to a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. \"Major life activities\" include, but are not limited to, functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, working, reading, concentrating, thinking, and communicating. \"Reasonable accommodation\" refers to a modification or adjustment of an academic requirement, or the provision of an auxiliary aid, that is necessary for a qualified student with a disability to have an equal opportunity to participate in the sch ool's programs and activities. Examples of adjustments, aids and services may include, but are not limited to: arranging for priority registration; reducing a course load; substituting one course for another; providing note takers, recording devices , or sign language interpreters; extended time for testing; and equipping school computers with screen- reading, voice recognition, or other adaptive software or hardware. Accommodations will be afforded to an individual with a disability in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of the individual. Not all listed accommodations may be available in each case. FNU is only obligated to provide accommodations that are reasonable. A reasonable accommodation does not include adjustments or provisio n of aids or services that would result in a fundamental alteration of the University's programs, impose an undue financial or administrative burden, or necessarily result in a direct threat to the health or safety of others. Also, a reasonable accommodation does not include one that would require the University to fundamentally alter its academic programs, or lower or substantially modify essential requirements . For example, the University's ability to grant accommodations related to certain clinical an d laboratory work may be limited. Similarly, while the University may provide extended testing time, it is not required to change the substantive content of a test or to provide testing time accommodations that are unreasonable. The University also is not required to provide devices or services of a personal nature (e.g., personal attendants, individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices or services of a personal nature, such as tutoring and typing). Students with the same diagnosis may receive different accommodations depending on the specific circumstances applicable to theme. Documentation of a specific diagnosis or disability does not automatically correlate to a specific accommodation. FNU is not required to pro vide the specific accommodation requested by a student and reserves the right to provide an effective alternate accommodation. Approved academic accommodations are not retroactive to prior coursework or courses. 98 Revised April 2021 \"Qualified student\" is a student with a disability who meets the academic and technical requirements for admission or participation in the institution's educational program or activity. 99 Revised April 2021 Students' Rights It is the right of the student to: 1.

Introduction Florida National University's (FNU) procedure for the student appeal of dismissal/disciplinary decisions ensures that both students and faculty are aware of the processes that are to be fo llowed when a decision is challenged. Procedure for Requesting a Session of t he Honor Court A session of the Student Honor Court may be requested by a student, an administrator, or a faculty member when all other means of appealing, such as following the c hain of command, have been exhausted. The request will be reviewed by the Office of Student Services.

Anti-Hazing Policy Florida National University strictly prohibits hazing of any kind. According to Florida Statute 240.36 hazing is defined as: 1. Any action or situation which reckless ly or intentionally endangers the mental or physical health or safety of a student, or which willfully destroys or removes public or private property for the purpose of initiation or admission into or in affiliation with, or as a condition for continued me mbership in any organization operating under the sanction of the University. 2. Such actions include but are not limited to: any physical brutality such as paddling, forced calisthenics, exposure to the elements; forced consumption of any food, liquor, drug, or any other substance; creation of excessive fatigue; psychological stress; engaging in public stunts; morally degrading or humiliating games or activities; and any other activity that is not consistent with the University's rules and regulations. 107 Revised April 2021 Hazing is illegal and dangerous. Students who engage in hazing activities are subject to penalties up to dismissal from the University. Organizations that authorize hazing activities are subject to penalties that may include recession of permission to operate at Florida National University. Dangerous Items Policy Weapons of any kind are expressly prohibited at FNU facilities, including vehicles parked on FNU property. Weapons include any item defined as a weapon under city, state, or federal law and include but are not limited to: guns of any kind, electroshock devices, slingshots, bows and arrows, spears, switchblades or knives, martial arts weapons, brass knuckles, any instrument that ejects projectiles. The University reserves the right to determine whether an item could be classified as dangerous and require immediate removal of the item from an FNU facility. This prohibition includes firearms carried by persons bearing a Florida Concealed Weapons Permit (CWP). As a private enterprise, we reserve the right to prohibit legally carried concealed firearms. An exception to this policy is a law enforcement officer, in official uniform, who is at an FNU facility to attend a course. A law enforcement officer, who is an active student or faculty member, ma y attend the course armed, only while in full uniform. Off duty, concealed carry of firearms is prohibited. Emergency Procedures a nd Equipment Policy Students will have readily available information regarding fire safety and prevention, emergency procedures, and evacuation procedures outlined in the Safety Manual. Designated fire equipment including fire doors, extinguishers, and fire alarms are to be used only in emergencies. Blocking, tampering, or any misuse of equipment is strictly prohibited and may result in criminal prosecution and/or disciplinary action by the University. **NOTE: The Campus Security Report is published annually and is available online under the Consumer Information Link and found under Campus Security. Lockdown Procedures In the event of a police action, such as an \"Active Shooter,\" it may be necessary to \"lockdown\" the campus to limit access, protect lives and minimize the overall exposure to danger. 108 Revised April 2021 A \"lockdown\" is a temporary sheltering technique, usually lasting from 30 minutes to several hours, used by law enforcement to limit civilian exposure to an \"Active Shooter\" or a similar incident. When alerted, occupants of any building within the subject area will lock all doors and windows. Do not allow entry or exit to anyone unti l the \"all clear\" has been sounded. This procedure converts any building into a large \"safe room.\" The Campus Dean or his/her designee evaluates the situation and takes immediate action to protect life and property. Other University administrators are noti fied as soon as the situation allows. Students, faculty, and staff are alerted via rave, bullhorns, telephones, in- person notification, and/or the University public -address system. Take Action If you encounter an intruder who is causing harm or threatening imminent harm to people, seek cover immediately and call 911 (police). Provide as many details as possible, such as location, number of assailants, weapons, and any other information you believe will be useful. Lockdown Instructions Never sound the fire a larm to evacuate the building, as everyone should remain inside. If a fire alarm goes off during a lockdown, do not evacuate unless you smell smoke. Be aware of alternate exits if it becomes necessary to flee. Lock yourself in a classroom, resident room, office, etc., as a means of protection. Stay low and away from windows. Barricade door(s) if possible and use furniture or desks as cover. Cover windows or other openings that allow a direct line of sight into the hallway. Shut the blinds or pull the shades down. Turn the lights off and remain silent. Try to give the impression that the room is empty. Silence cell phones. Turn off the vibrate function. Do not attempt to leave the building until told to do so by security or police personnel. If you are outside when a lockdown is announced, enter the nearest building and follow the lockdown instructions above. If you cannot safely enter a building, hide behind a large heavy object (i.e., vehicle or tree) or run away from the hostile activity. If you encou nter an active shooter - Get Out, Call 911 and Hide Move quickly - do not wait for others to validate your decision. Leave belongings behind. Survival chances increase the farther you are from the shooter. Call 911 and give the operator as much information as possible, including the location, a description of the shooter (and name if known) and the number and type of weapons being used. Do not hang up until told to do so. Hide Out If unable to get out because the shooter is between you and the only exit, hi de. Try to find a place that is well protected. 109 Revised April 2021 Avoid places that might trap you or restrict movement. Find a room that can be locked with objects to hide behind. Barricade door with heavy furniture. Turn out lights and remain silent. Silence any device that may create a noise (i.e., cell phones, iPads, etc.). If there are two or more of you, DO NOT huddle together. It gives you options and makes it harder for the shooter. Quietly develop a plan of action in the event the shooter enters. Remain calm t o keep others focused on survival. Assume shooter's intentions are lethal. Attempt to take out the shooter only if you believe the shooter will kill or continue killing unless you intervene. Develop a mindset that you have \"what it takes\" to survive when your life is on the line. Be prepared to do whatever it takes to neutralize the threat. Throw things, create a distraction or use improvised weapons. 110 Revised April 2021 Title IX and Sexual Harassment Sexual Harassment Policy Florida National University is committed to providing an environment that is free of sexual harassment. Such behavior is illegal under both state and federal law and will not be tolerated. Sexual harassment is unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature. Sexual harassment can include unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, other verbal, nonverbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature or with sexual overtones, and gender- based harassment based on sex or sex-stereotyping. Sexual harassment includes sexual violence, including sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. Sexual harassment of or by any faculty member, administrator, employee, or student is expressly prohibited. Any person found to violate this policy shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary action up to suspension or discharge from the University. Any person who has been sexually harassed should file a complaint using the Title IX Grievance Form which is available online at https://www.fnu.edu/Publications/Title -IX- Grievance -Form.pdf or from the Office of Student Services or Title IX Coordinator(s). Every complaint will be promptly investigated and resolved. Students should refer to the Title IX: Sex- Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policies and Procedures in the Student Handbook for further information found at the following link: https://www.fnu.edu/wp -content/uploads/2020/07/FNU -Title-IX-Procedures -Clean- Version -for-Posting -8-14-2020-D0904210.pdf Title IX Procedures Title IX: Sex -Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policies and Procedures Sex Discrimination Prohibited Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (\"Title IX\") is a federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally assisted education programs or activities. Title IX protects students, employees, applicants for admission and employment, and other persons from all forms of sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, sexual exploitation, gender -based harassment, stalking, dating violence, domestic violence, and gender identity or failure to conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity. Florida National University does not discriminate on the basis of sex in its education programs and activities. The University prohibits all forms of sex discrimination. Definitions Sexual Harassment: Sexual harassment is unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature. Conduct is unwelcome if the complainant did not request or invite it and regarded the conduct as undesirable or offensive; acquiescence in the conduct or failure to complain does not always mean that 111 Revised April 2021 the conduct was welcome. Sexual harassment can include unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, other verbal, nonverbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature or with sexual overtones, and gender- based harassment based on sex or sex - stereo typing. Sexual Violence: Sexual violence includes dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking. Dating Violence: Dating violence is violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim. Dating violence includes, but is not limited to, sexual or physical abuse or the threat of such abuse. Dating violence does not include acts covered under the definition of domestic violence. Domestic Violence: Domestic violence is a f elony or misdemeanor crime of violence committed 1) by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim; 2) by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common; 3) by a person who is cohabitating with, or has cohabitated with, the victim as a spouse or intimate partner; 4) by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction in which the crime of violence occurred, or 5) by any other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that person's acts under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction in which the crime of violence occurred. The State of Florida defines domestic violence as any assault, aggravated assault, battery, aggravated battery, sexual assault, sexual battery, stalking, aggravated stalking, kidnapping, false imprisonment, or any criminal offense resulting in physical injury or death of one family or household member by another family or household member. \"Family or household mem ber\" means spouses, former spouses, persons related by blood or marriage, persons who are presently residing together as if a family or who have resided together in the past as if a family, and persons who are parents of a child in common regardless of whe ther they have been married. With the exception of persons who have a child in common, the family or household members must be currently residing or have in the past resided together in the same single dwelling unit. See Fla. Stat. \u00a7 741.28. Sexual Assault : Sexual assault is any sexual act directed against another person, without consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent that meets the definition of rape, fondling, incest, or statutory rape. Rape is the penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus, with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim. This offense includes the rape of both males and females. Fondling is the touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the 112 Revised April 2021 victim is incapable of giving consent because of his/her age or because of his/her temporary or permanent mental incapacity. Incest is sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law. Statutory Rape is sexual intercourse with a person who is under the statutory age of consent. Florida s tatutory rape law is violated when a person has consensual sexual intercourse with an individual under age 18. However, there is an exemption for individuals close in age, which allows a person no older than age 23 to engage in consensual sexual intercours e with minors aged 16 or 17. Stalking: Stalking means engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to 1) fear for the person's safety or the safety of others or 2) suffer substantial emotional distress. Course of conduct means two or more acts, including, but not limited to, acts in which the stalker directly, indirectly, or through third parties, by any action, method, device, or means, follows, monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communicates to or about a person, or interferes with a person's property. Reasonable person means a reasonable person under similar circumstances and with similar identities to the victim. Substantial emotional distress means significant mental suffering or anguish t hat may, but does not necessarily, require medical or other professional treatment or counseling. Consent: Consent means a clear, unambiguous, and voluntary agreement between the parties engaging in specific sexual activity. A person is incapable of consent when he or she is: 1) mentally disabled; mentally incapacitated; 3) physically helpless or incapacitated; or 4) under threat, coercion or force. The State of Florida defines consent as intelligent, knowing, and voluntary consent, which does not include c oerced submission. \"Consent\" shall not be deemed or construed to mean the failure by the alleged victim to offer physical resistance to the offender. Among other things, the State of Florida does not consider a victim to be able to consent if the victim is mentally defective, physically incapacitated, or has been administered any narcotic, anesthetic or other intoxicating substance that mentally or physically incapacitates the victim. See Fla. Stat. \u00a7 794.011. Examples of Sexual Harassment The following are examples of behavior may create a hostile environment and could be considered sexual harassment prohibited by Title IX: Requests or demands for sexual favors Unwelcome sexual advances, including touching, kissing, hugging, or massaging Non-consensual sex ual activity (where the victim does not consent or is incapable of giving consent) Violence between intimate partners 113 Revised April 2021 Unnecessary and unwelcome references to various parts of the body Unwelcome statements or conduct related to a person's gender, actual or perceived sex, gender identity, or nonconformity with sex or gender stereotypes Reoccurring inappropriate or derogatory sexual innuendoes or humor Videotaping and photographing activity of a sexual or personal nature without consent of those being recorded Obscene gestures or nonverbal communication of a sexual or gender- based nature Sexually explicit profanity Use of email, the Internet, text messaging, or other forms of digital media to facilitate any of the above referenced behaviors Sexual Harassment Pr ohibited by Title IX Sexual harassment that creates a hostile environment by interfering with, denying or limiting a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the school's program on the basis of sex is prohibited by Title IX. FNU will consider the following factors in determining whether sexual harassment creates a hostile environment: The degree to which the conduct affects one or more students' education; The type, frequency, and duration of the conduct; The identity of and relationship between the respondent and the complainant: The number of individuals involved; The location of the incidents and the context in which they occurred; and Other incidents at the school. This includes quid pro quo sexual harassment, where such advances or re quests are made under circumstances implying that one's response or submission to unwanted sexual conduct might affect educational or personnel decisions that are subject to the influence of the person making the proposal. For example, quid pro quo sexual harassment occurs when submission to sexual harassment is made, either explicitly or implicitly, a term or condition of instruction, employment, or participation in other College activities. Florida National University believes that any form of sexual harassment can have a devastating effect upon the people involved and such behavior will not be tolerated. Prompt action will be taken to protect the complainant, investigate the charges, and if warranted, discipline the violator. Such action may include suspension or dismissal. Sexual Violence Prevention and Response The University educates the student community about sexual violence prevention through the Office of Student Services. The Office of Student Services provides educational materials and conducts prevention and awareness programs for students to promote awareness of, and to prevent sexual violence. Such materials and programs educate students regarding prohibited sexual violence (including relevant definitions), the definition of consent in the state of Florida, safe and positive options for bystander intervention, risk reduction to recognize warning signs of abusive behavior and how to 114 Revised April 2021 avoid potential attacks, and the University's response to sexual violence (including the complaint procedures and possible sanctions and protective measures). If you are a victim of sexual violence, first seek safety and then immediate medical attention. The University strongly encourages any victim of sexual violence to report the incident in a timely manner. Time is a critical factor for collecting and preserving of evidence. (Ideally, a victim of sexual violence should not wash, douche, use the restroom, or change clothes prior to a medical examination at a hospital.) The University encourages students to report incidents of sexual violence to the local police department by dialing 911 and to report the incident to the Campus Dean or Title IX Coordinators (who can also assist you with the reporting of an act of sexual violence to the police). The University also s trongly advises victims of sexual violence to seek counseling. Local organizations that specialize in crises counseling include: Resources Phone Number s RAINN -Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (800) 656 -4673 Victims of Crimes Services (305) 230 -6141 Opa Locka Domestic Police - Violence Intervention Unit (305) 953 -2838 Procedures for Filing a Sexual Harassment Complaint Any member of the University community who believes that he or she has been a victim of sexual harassment (the complainant) by a student, a University employee or a third party may bring the matter to the attention of the Title IX Coordinator or Deputy Coordinators (collectively, the \"Title IX Coordinators\"). The complainant may also report these matters to either of the following employees: Campus Dean. Associate Dean, Assistant Dean, Vice President of Academic Affairs, Student Services Director, Student Services Officer, Student Services Assistant, Athletic Director or Assistant Athletic Director. It is the responsibility of that individual to file the report with one of the Title IX Coordinators. The complainant should present the complaint as promptly as possible after the alleged harassment occurs using the Title IX Grievance Form which is available online at https://www.fnu.edu/Publications/Title -IX-Grievance -Form.pdf or from the Office of Student Services or the Title IX Coordinators. Grievance Forms should be submitted directly to one of the Title IX Coordinators or the Director of Student Services. Complainants are encouraged to file complaints promptly because the passage of time typically makes it more difficult to conduct an investigation. Further, it is easier to commence legal proceedings (both civil and criminal) against the accused if the reports are made promptly. If the complainant decides to proceed with a formal complaint, the complainant should submit a written statement to one of the Title IX Coordinators. 115 Revised April 2021 FNU's Title IX Coordinator will investigate all student complaints of sexual harassment. The Title IX Coordinator will inform the alleged offender (respondent) of the allegation, the identity of the complainant, the alleged violation of the University's policies, and the date and location of the alleged incident(s). A written statement of the complaint will be given to both parties. Exceptions can be made when confidentiality is requested by the complainant, as described below. Cases involving sexual harassment are particularly sensitive and demand special attention to issues of confidentiality. Dissemination of information relating to the case will be limited in order that the privacy of all individuals involved is safeguarded as fully as possible. Retaliation against the complainant is prohibited. Every effort will be made to protect the complainant from retaliatory action. Resolution of the Complaint The University will promptly take steps to ensure that the complainant and the respondent have equal access to the University's educational programs and activities and to protect the complainant and the respondent as necessary, including taking interim measures before the outcome of an investigation. Interim measures are determined on a case -by- case basis and may include counseling, schedule accommodations, academic accommodations, no -contact directives, stay -away letters/campus bans, escorts, limitations on extracurricular or athletic activities, and leaves of absence. When implementing interim measures, the University w ill make every effort to avoid depriving any student of his or her education. Reports of alleged Title IX incidents will be investigated in a thorough, impartial, and prompt fashion. The Title IX Coordinator will oversee the collecting of facts related to any reported Title IX incident and will assess whether a further review or investigation is necessary. The Title IX Coordinator will notify and interview complainants, respondents, and witnesses. At the conclusion of the investigation, the Title IX Coord inator will prepare a written report summarizing the relevant exculpatory and inculpatory evidence. Directly following the conclusion of the investigation, the Title IX Coordinator will determine whether reasonable cause exists to believe that a policy vio lation occurred. If such reasonable cause exists and the respondent is a student, the Title IX Coordinator will notify University administrators and determine whether to pursue an informal or formal resolution, as described below. Where the respondent is a faculty or staff member, the Title IX Coordinator will refer the results of the investigation to the Human Resources Department and the University administrators for appropriate action. The Title IX Coordinator will be kept informed of the outcome of the investigation regarding a faculty or staff member and will notify the complainant, as appropriate, of the outcome, including any accommodations the University will provide to the complainant. If reasonable cause exists to believe that a policy violation occurred, the Title IX Coordinator believes it is appropriate given the circumstances of the complaint to engage in an informal resolution process, and all parties voluntarily agree to participate in such a process, the Title IX Coordinator will initiate whatever steps he or she deems appropriate to affect an informal resolution of the complaint acceptable to both parties. The 116 Revised April 2021 complainant or respondent may request to end the informal process at any time to begin the formal stage of the complaint process. If unsatisfied with the informal resolution proposed by the Title IX Coordinator, the complainant or respondent should write a written request to the Title IX Coordinator with his or her opinions and suggestions, including any request to appear before the Honor Court. If reasonable cause exists to believe that a policy violation occurred and the Title IX Coordinator believes that an informal resolution process is not appropriate based on the nature of the violation, or one or more of the parties requests ac cess to the formal stage of the complaint process, the complaint and the results of the investigation will be forwarded to the Honor Court. Unless the Honor Court concludes that the complaint is without merit, the parties to the dispute should be invited to appear before the Honor Court, present any witnesses and evidence, and confront any adverse witnesses. The Honor Court may conduct its own informal inquiry, call witnesses, and gather whatever information it deems necessary to assist it in reaching a determination as to the merits of the allegations. The parties will be given adequate notice of any hearing before the Honor Court and will be offered equal and meaningful access to information used during the hearing, including the Title IX Coordinator's report. The parties will also have the opportunity to provide written responses to the Title IX Coordinator's report. The parties may be accompanied at the Honor Court hearing by the advisor of their choice. The advisor may not participate in the hearing, beyond providing guidance to the party being represented. The Honor Court will make findings of fact and conclusions as to whether the facts support a finding of responsibility for violation of the school's policies using a clear and convincing evidence sta ndard. Thus, the Honor Court must determine whether it is more probable than not that the conduct occurred. If the Honor Court determines that it is more probable than not that the conduct occurred, it should recommend sanctions against the respondent and any additional accommodations for the complainant. The Title IX Coordinator should forward the recommendation immediately to one of the campus deans. The campus dean shall proceed in the manner set forth by the university's rules and procedures, except that the need for a preliminary review will be precluded. The Honor Court can recommend the following sanctions if it finds that a student has violated this policy: Suspension, Expulsion, Loss of University Scholarship. The Honor Court can recommend the fo llowing accommodations for the complainant: classroom adjustments or changes, academic support (tutoring, mentoring, flexible assignment due dates, allowing the student to make up coursework), allowing the student to retake a course and/or withdraw without penalty, counseling services and protective/no contact orders. Florida National University seeks to resolve all Title IX reports within sixty (60) days but more complex investigations may require additional time, especially if the matter is brought before the Honor Court. The Title IX Coordinator will notify the complainant and 117 Revised April 2021 the respondent in writing of the results of the investigation including a summary of the basis for the determination and the actions that will be taken. Confidentiality The Title I X Coordinator is required to investigate any report of alleged sex and gender based misconduct and to ensure measures are taken to stop adverse behavior and prevent its recurrence, as appropriate. Each report is reviewed individually and it is important to note that not every report leads to a disciplinary process. A student can request confidentiality after making a Title IX report. For example, a complainant may request that his or her name not be disclosed or that an investigation not be conducted regarding the alleged harassment. If the complainant requests confidentiality, the Title IX Coordinator will take all reasonable steps to investigate and respond to the complaint consistent with the student's request. The University will evaluate any conf identiality requests in the context of its responsibility to provide a safe and nondiscriminatory environment for all students. For example, if there have been other similar accusations against the same respondent such that the University is concerned about the safety of its students, the University may not be able to respect a request for confidentiality. If the University can honor the complainant's request for confidentiality, the Title IX Coordinator's ability to investigate the incident could be limite d. For example, the University cannot take disciplinary action against the respondent if the complainant requests that his or her name not be revealed. Even when confidentiality is not requested, the University makes every effort to protect the privacy of all individuals involved in such reporting or investigation, yet it cannot always be guaranteed depending on the nature of the incident. Any alleged incidents of sexual violence must be reported to the Office of Student Services so they may be included in the University's crime log and the annual security report. Crimes of sexual violence can be reported without disclosing either party's name or any other information that would identify the parties. Complaints involving students are protected under the Fami ly Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) but may be disclosed for legitimate educational purposes within the University. To disclose the information outside of the University, any affected students would have to give explicit permission for the information to be shared through the Disclosure of Information Form available at the FNU Publications webpage and at the Office of the Registrar, except as described below. Under FERPA the University does not need student consent to: disclose to the complainant i nformation about the sanction imposed upon a student respondent who was found to have engaged in harassment when the sanction directly relates to the complainant; disclose to the complainant the final results of a disciplinary proceeding against the respondent, regardless of whether the University concluded that a violation was committed, when the conduct involves a crime of violence or a non -forcible sex offense; and disclose to anyone \u2014not just the complainant\u2014the final results of a disciplinary proceeding if it determines that the student respondent is an alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence or a non- forcible sex offense, and, with respect to the 118 Revised April 2021 allegation made, the student has committed a violation of the institution's rules or policies. Medical re cords are confidential and medical and health professionals are required to maintain confidentiality with regard to the patient's information. Retaliation Retaliation is prohibited under Title IX against any person who in good faith makes a complaint of se x discrimination, harassment, sexual violence, sexual misconduct, or participates as a witness in a Title IX investigation. The University, the respondent, and the respondent's associates may not retaliate against an individual for bringing a complaint or for participating in an investigation. The University will take steps to prevent retaliation against a complainant by the respondent or his or her associates.

Some courses are offered on Saturdays and clinical practices are offered 7 days a week, (scheduling based on program requirements and site availability). FNU also offers internet- based distance learning courses. FNU has a self -scheduling procedure established for some of the programs offered and it is accessed through the FNU Portal. Certificate programs that run sequentially do not have the ability to have classes self -scheduled. Degree Programs have the self -scheduling option except Nursing Programs (ADN, BSN and MSN) as well as Physical Therap ist Assistant, Sonography, Radiology and Respiratory Therapy core courses. Specific instructions are posted in https://www.fnu.edu/wp- content/uploads/2020/03/Students - self-scheduling -process -step-by-step.pdf Changes to the class sc hedule can be made only during the ADD/DROP period (first week of the semester ). Any changes to the schedule must be approved by the Department/Division Head and a Cancel/Add form must be filled out and turned in to the Registrar's Office. The Cancel/Add form is available at the Registrar's Office of each Campus and on the FNU websi te. Distance Learning students must submit the completed form to the Registrar's Office via either e -mail at registrars@fnu.edu or fax at (305) 362 - 0595, Attention to: Registrar's Office. Additional questions about the Distance Learning Department can be emailed to distancelearning@fnu.edu . Class schedule changes are subject to class load and availability. The student must check the FNU student portal to ensure that changes are accepted. To access or print your class schedule, you must set up an account on the FNU student portal. Instructions are available on the FNU website. A username and password are required. You will also be able to use the FNU Portal to access other pertinent information. It is the student' s responsibility to withdraw, cancel, or change any courses assigned to him/her during the ADD/DROP period . After the ADD/DROP period, no schedule changes will be accepted for the Term B, unless it is an emergenc y, and the student will be charged for the change $50.00 per change. Approved changes for Term B can only be done by substituting the class with another course carrying the same credit load and by paying the $50.00 fee. Please note that all changes carry a $50.00 fee even if it just a change of session. 124 Revised April 2021 Classification of Students or Status STUDENTS ARE CLASSIFI ED IN VARIOUS WAYS : A. By class load: 1. Full time ( 12 credit hours minimum per semester) * For Undergraduate Programs 2. Full time (9 credit hours minimum per semester) * For Graduate Programs 3. Three Quarter time ( 9 credit hours minimum per semester ) For Undergraduate Programs 4. Half time ( 6 credit hours minimum per semester ) *For both Graduate and Undergraduate Programs 5.

Vocational Rehab. 125 Revised April 2021 Class Load, Credit Hour , and Clock Hour Equivalency Class load refers to the number of credits a student carries in a semester . For degree and career programs a student may carry a load of 17 credit hours maximum per semester . One credit hour equals 15 clock hours of lecture, 30 clock hours of Lab., 45 clock hours of externship , or 100 clock hours of pre -clinical or clinical journal . One clock hour is equivalent to 50 minutes of lecture and a 10 - minute break. Utilizing the definition that an hour of work is the equivalent of 50 minutes of class time (often called a contact hour), the university policy requires at least 45 hours of work by each student for each unit of credit. Contact hours required for specific types of courses are as follows: At least 15 contact hours of lecture as well as a minimum of 30 hours of student homework are required for each unit of student credit. Laboratory courses must maintain a minimum of 30 contact hours per unit of credit. Each unit of internship or practicum must require a minimum of 45 hours of work. Clinical hours with instructor must require a minimum of 30 hours per unit of credit. Certificate Programs: Since courses within a certificate program are not acceptable for credit toward a degree program within the institution, the conversion formula for certifica te programs is as follows: one c redit hour equals 37.5 clock hours of lecture, 37.5 clock hours of Lab. , or 37.5 clock hours of externship (30 hours should be in the classroom and 7.5 hours are external) . Transient and Non degree- Seeking Student Admission A student who is in good standing at another college or university may be admitted to Florida National University as a transient student. Transient students should consult the Registrar or Vice President of Academic Affairs at the university to which they wish their credits transferred to determine the acceptability of outside credits at their home institution. For classification purposes, employees or family members seeking credits at FNU are also referred to as Transient students. Applicants who are ta king a course, but without enrolling in a program, are classified as nondegree -seeking students. At Florida National University these students are limited to thirty credits in this classification, and they are not eligible for financial aid. Minimum Credit s Policy Master 's of Science Students receiving Florida National University's Master of Science degrees must earn a minimum of 36 semester credit hours. Additional Requirements for Master 's of Science To be eligible for a Master of Science degree, students must: 126 Revised April 2021 Complete a designated program of study which includes at least 36 semester hours of credit. Complete degree requirements with a cumulative grade average of 3.0 or higher. Bachelor of Science or Arts Students receiving Florida National University's Bachelor of Science degrees must earn a minimum of 120 semester credit hours. The 120 credit hours include a minimum of 39 credit hours of prescribed general education courses. Additional Requireme nts for Bachelor of Arts or Science To be eligible for a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree, students must: Complete a designated program of study which includes at least 120 semester hours of credit. Both degrees require that all required co urses in a program be completed. Complete degree requirements with a cumulative grade average of 2.0 or higher. Complete the final 25% of a program through Florida National University. Associate of Arts Students receiving Florida National University's Ass ociate of Arts degree must successfully complete at least 60 semester credit hours of study. The 60 credit hours must include a minimum of 39 semester credit hours of prescribed general education courses Associate of Science Students receiving Florida National University's Associate of Science degree must successfully complete at least 60 semester credit hours of study. The 60 credit hours include a minimum of 19 semester credit hours of prescribed general education courses. NOTE: As Associate of Science degree is considered a terminal degree.

Additional Requirements for Associate of Arts or Science To be eligible for an Associate of Arts or Science degree, students must: Complete a designated program of study which includes at least 60 semester hours of credit. Both degrees require that all required courses in a program be completed. Complete degree requirements with a cumulative grade average of 2.0 or higher. Compl ete the last 25% of a program at Florida National University. 127 Revised April 2021 Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy All students must meet certain minimum standards for Satisfactory Academic Progress while enrolled at Florida National University (FNU). To achieve Satisfactory Academic Progress, a student must satisfy three criteria, each of which is evaluated, on a cumulative basis, at the end of each semester. The three criteria are: Cumulative Grade Point Average - must meet mi nimum thresholds in table below Pace of Progression - must successfully complete at l east 66.7% of credits attempted Maximum Time Frame - must complete the program in no more than 150 percent of the n ormal time frame for completion Grade Point Average : The grade point average or GPA for a semester is calculated by dividing (a) a number equal to the sum of credit hours for each course attempted during the semester times the quality point value for each grade earned in the course by (b) a number equal to the number of credit hours attempted during the semester (i.e., hours from courses with grades A through F). The cumulative grade point average , or CGPA, is obtained by calculating the GPA for all courses attempted at Florida National University with grades of A through F. Course grades of S, U, I, W, AU, and TC do not count in the overall C GPA since they carry no quality points, but they do count as credits attempted for purposes of determining the Pace of Progression. The minimum CGPA required to maintain SAP varies depending on the program the student is enrolled in and the number of credits the student has attempted, as set forth in the Table below. See the Grading System section for more information. Pace o f Progression: Pace of p rogression is measured by calculating, at the end of each semester, the cumulative number of credits successfully completed (i.e., courses with a grade of A through D) as a percentage of the cumulative number of credits attempted. Maximum Time Frame: The maximum time frame for completing a program is equal to 150 percent of the normal time frame for completing the program as measured in credit hours. For example, a full -time student in a baccalaureate program normally would complete the program in four academic years with 120 semester hours. The maxi mum time frame for such a student to complete the program would be 180 semester hours. The Pace of Progression requirement is intended to ensure that the students are on pace to graduate within the Maximum Time Frame. Maintenance of Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) is a requirement for graduation; it is also necessary to maintain eligibility for Title IV financial assistance. FNU evaluates Satisfactory Academic Progress at the end of every semester. Students must continue to meet the minimum SAP standards as measured at the end of each semester, to maintain eligibility for financial assistance. The CGPA and Pace of Progression are be based on all periods of enrollment even when the student did not receive Title IV funds. However, should a student change programs at FNU, SAP will be 128 Revised April 2021 based on all coursework that is applicable to the student's current degree, diploma, or certificate program of study. If the student does not meet the minimum SAP standards at the end of a semester, the student will be placed on Academic/Financial Aid Warning for the following semester. All students on Academic/Financial Aid Warning will be monitored for SAP again at the end of the semester on Academic Warning. Students who are eligible for Federal s tudent aid funds co ntinue to receive those funds while on Academic Warning. All students on Academic/Financial Aid Warning who meet the minimum SAP standards at the end of the semester will be removed from Academic/Financial Aid Warning. Any student who fails to meet the mi nimum SAP standards at the end of the semester on Academic/Financial Aid Warning will be considered for dismissal and suspended for the coming semester. The student may appeal the suspension by submitting a written request explaining and documenting why t he student failed to achieve SAP, such as the death of a relative, an injury or illness, or other special circumstances, and how circumstances have changed such that the student will be able to achieve SAP at the end of the next semester if permitted to re -enroll. A student requesting an appeal must submit a written request to the Vice President of Academic Affairs and Vice President/Director of Financial Aid. If the appeal is granted, the student may re -enroll and will be placed on Academic/Financial Aid Probation for the coming semester. If eligible for Federal student aid, those funds will continue during the semester on Academic/Financial Aid Probation. All students on Academic/Financial Aid Probation are monitored again for SAP at the end of the sem ester on Academic/Financial Aid Probation. All such students who satisfy the minimum SAP standards at the end of the semester will be removed from Academic/Financial Aid Probation and will continue to remain subject to the SAP requirements. All students on Academic/Financial Aid Probation who do not satisfy the SAP requirements at the end of the semester will be dismissed. All financial aid applicants in eligible degree/diploma/certificate programs are evaluated for SAP whether they received financial assistance in prior terms or not. If the student attended FNU in the past and seeks to re -enroll, the student will be reviewed for SAP for financial aid purposes on all previously attempted courses that are applicable to the student's current program of en rollment regardless of how long ago the student attended FNU or whether or not aid was received. When a student transfers course credits to FNU, transfer credits count as credits attempted and credits earned. The student may modify the initial course schedule up to the last day of the add/ drop period with a refund. Classes that are dropped during this time period are not counted as part of the SAP evaluation process. If the student withdraws after the add/ drop period, it will negatively affect the Pace of Progression and Maximum Time Frame requirements because the credits will count as credits attempted but not credits earned. If a student repeats a course, the higher grade is used in the CGPA but credits for bo th courses count as credit hours attempted. 129 Revised April 2021 If the student changes degree or certificate programs, the SAP calculation will reset to only count those credits that are applicable to the student's new program of study. Credits that do not count toward the new program of study will not be included in the pace calculation and the related grades will not be included in the CGPA. Remedial credit hours completed are used in Grade Point Average calculations, but not in Pace of Progression, and Maximum Time Frame calculations. Standards o f Academic Progress f or VA Students Students receiving VA educational benefits must maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of 2.0 for undergraduate and 3.0 for graduate programs each semester. A VA student whose CGPA falls below 2.0 (undergraduate) or 3.0 (graduate) at the end of any semester will be placed on academic warning for a maximum of two consecutive terms of enrollment and the VA will be notified. IAW VA guidelines, during the academi c warning period, the university is not able to certify the student for VA educational benefits. If the VA student's CGPA is still below 2.0 (undergraduate) or 3.0 (graduate) at the end of the second consecutive term on warning, the student's VA educatio nal benefits will be terminated. A VA student terminated from VA educational benefits due to unsatisfactory progress may petition the school to be recertified after attaining a CGPA of 2.0 (undergraduate) or 3.0 (graduate). 130 Revised April 2021 Master Degree Programs Credits Attempted Minimum CGPA at end of each semester Minimum % of cumulative credits attempted that have been successfully completed at end of each semester 1 - 36 3.0 66.7% Bachelors and Associate Degree Programs Credits Attempted Minimum CGPA at end of each semester Minimum % of cumulative credits attempted that have been successfully completed at end of each semester 1 - 12 1.3 66.7% 13 - 24 1.5 66.7% 25- 36 1.7 66.7% 37 - 48 1.8 66.7% 49 - 60 2 66.7% 60 - above 2 66.7% Diploma Programs Credits Attempted Minimum CGPA at end of each semester Minimum % of credits attempted that have been successfully completed at end of each semester 1 - 12 1.3 66.7% 13 - 24 1.5 66.7% 25- 30 2 66.7% 45 - above 2 66.7% Certificate Programs Credits Attempt Warning if CGPA is below Minimum Credits (%) to Complete 0 - 9 1.5 66.7% 10 - 18. 2 66.7% A student who has been dismissed for failure to satisfy SAP following a semester on Academic/Financial Aid Probation may reapply to Florida National University after being 131 Revised April 2021 out of school for one semester . If re admitted, the student will remain subject to all SAP requirements and, if otherwise eligible for Federal student aid, will not be eligible to receive such funds until and unless the students meets all SAP requirements. Attendance Policy The policy on attendance for university classes will be the respo nsibility of the professor, and the professor will fully inform students of such policy at the beginning of the semester via the course syllabus . The faculty and staff at Florida National University want students to succeed. Since research studies indicat e a positive relationship between good attendance and better grades, students are strongly encouraged to attend all classes and arrive on time. * Individual instructors establish their own class attendance policies. Each instructor's policy is included in the course syllabus and distributed at the beginning of each semester . * It is the student's responsibility to understand and follow these policies and, if possible, to notify instructors in advance when it is necessary to miss a class. * Any anticipated prolonged absences should be reported to instructors as soon as possible. * If a student stops attending class( es) for any reason, they must consult with the instructor(s) and registrar about possible withdrawal from the class( es). Veteran's Attendance Policy Replace with: Refer to university's attendance policy. Per Title 38, CFR 21.9725 Attendance is unsatisfactory if the individual does not attend according to the regularly prescribed standards of the institution of higher learning in which he or she is enrolled. Leave o f Absence Any student requesting a leave of absence (LOA) from the institution must submit a written request to the Registrar' s Office which includes the reason why the student wants to go on LOA. The LOA request form is located at the Registrar's Office of every campus or can be downloaded from the FNU website. Distance Learning students must submit the completed form to the Registrar's Office via either e -mail (registrars@fnu.edu) or fax at (305) 362 -0595, Attention to: Registrar's Office. Additional questions about the Distance Learning Department can be emailed to distancelearning@fnu.edu. The Leave of Absence must be requested ONLY during the ADD/DROP period. The request needs to be signed and dated by the student and must include the date student expects to return to school. The request must be approved by the campus registrar and a financial aid officer. Federal regulations allow an approved leave of absence of no more than 180 days. There are no exceptions. Multipl e leave of absences can be granted not exceeding 180 days. 132 Revised April 2021 An LOA extends the graduation date. Students on LOA will normally not be able to maintain their course sequencing. A student on leave of absence will not incur additional charges by the school during this period, though monthly payments must continue during the LOA. If the student does not report back to FNU by the add/drop period of the following semester, the student will be considered to have withdrawn from school as of the date the student be gan their LOA. The University has thirty days after the last day of an approved leave of absence to process financial assistance refunds to grantors. By official regulation, international students may use a leave of absence (LOA) only after completion of one academic year (8 months). Military Leave of Absence (MLOA) policy: If a student must stop attending due to a military service obligation (such Military Deployment, Training, PCS (permanent change of station), Mobilization, or Special Duty), notify the University, and the University will work with you to identify solutions that will not result in a debt balance for the returned portion. MLOA's are an extension of the university's Leave of Absence (LOA) policy. Note: the student must provide supporting documentation Standard Period o f Non -Enrollment Students enrolled in Certificate Programs, and planning to be out of FNU for one term (two months) , must submit a written request for a Standard Period of Non- Enrollment to the Registrar' s Office. The SPNE request form is located in the Registrar's Office or can be downloaded from the FNU website. SPNE's are usually approved for one term (two months) per semester. However, during the summer semester, a student can request it for four months (one semester). A Standard Period of Non- Enrollment must be requested prior to the start of the term or during the first week of classes of the term the student is planning to be away from FNU . After the ADD/DROP period, no SPNE requests are granted. Students will receive a \"W\" for that term once that SPNE is approved. If the SPNE is only for one term (two months), the student's remaining schedule of courses will remain the same. The request must be authorized by the Campus Registrar and the Financia l Aid officer. Students must report to the Registrar' s Office by the date indicated on the Standard Period of Non -Enrollment form. Students who fail to return to the University by the expected date will be considered to have withdrawn from the school, and the student will therefore be responsible for any balance due. An SPNE extends a student's graduation date. Students on SPNE may not be able to maintain their course sequencing. 133 Revised April 2021 Re-Enrollment / Readmission Typically, a Re -Enrollment is a student who withdrew and requests enrollment in another program and Readmission is for students who withdrew and desire to return to the same program within five years. In both cases students must satisfy the readmission procedures as follows: 1. The student who withdrew with a CGPA of 2.0 or better and a clear balance will resume his/her studies following regular admission procedures. 2. The student who was terminated because of academic probation or lack of attendance and has two consecutive sem esters with a GPA under 2.0 cannot be considered for Re -Enrollment or Readmission unless the student requests a waiver of the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy. The following process will apply: a) A student who has been dropped or suspended because of inability to maintain a CGPA of 2.0 may reapply to Florida National University after being out of school for a minimum of one term. At that time, the student's academic records will be evaluated to determine if it is possible for a 2. 0 cumulative grade point average to be achieved and if the program can be completed within the maximum time frame of 1.5 time of the normal time frame for completion. If it is not possible for the student to meet both standards, the student will no longer be eligible for Title IV funds. b) Additionally , Florida National University may use its discretion in waiving its Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy in cases where students have mitigating circumstances. Students requesting an appeal must submit a written request, with appropriate documentation, to the Vice President of Academic Affairs and the Vice President/Director of Financial Aid. If the appeal is approved, the student will be allowed one additional semester to meet the required standards and will be eligible for Title IV funds. 3. The student who was terminated because of inability to fulfill costs will have to pay the complete balance before classes start. 4. The student who was terminated because of serious violations of FNU rules may no t reapply at FNU for admission. Additionally, Florida National University reserves the right to reject the application request of any student who comes from any other institution where the student has lost \"Good Standing\" status. Students that decide to continue onto a different program once a program has been completed, are not considered re -entry nor re -enrollments. Tutorials Florida National University offers students tutorials in various subjects at all of its campuses. Tutorial information is posted on each campus, on the FNU website, and on the university's Facebook page. Students may also contact their individual instructor for additional help with the subject area(s) in which they have difficulty . 134 Revised April 2021 English f or Academic Purposes The Universit y offers English for Academic Purposes (EAP) courses to incoming students who have limited English Language Proficiency to succeed at the college level. The university will use the criteria listed below to identify those students who may be eligible for EAP courses as well as the score from the institution' s diagnostic test. a) Student has a foreign high school diploma b) Student was enrolled in ESL courses during his/her 11th and 12th grades c) Student graduated from an alternative high school d) Student completed high school requirements but did not pass the FCAT exam and received a high school certificate of completion e) Student earned a high school diploma or GED in Spanish Distance Learning In addition to ground courses, Florida National University of fers programs and courses through distance learning. Students can choose to take programs fully online or supplement their ground programs with some online classes. Our online courses use a learning management system (LMS) called Blackboard Ultra to delive r instruction and to support coursework. Our courses use the latest interactive technology and provide forums for group study, discussion and support. Distance Learning is more flexible than traditional ground courses, which provides an avenue for students who may be working or otherwise have a nontraditional schedule to attain their educational goals. Furthermore, distance learning students receive support from academic advisors and LMS support staff well - versed in the online -learning environment. Student Usage o f University Computers a t All Campuses The use of university computers is available outside class hours in the computer Lab(s) and the campus libraries. Hours of operation for the computer lab(s) are posted and a lab assistant will be on site to assist students with basic information.

Legal Alternatives for A cquiring Copyrighted Material: The internet contains a wealth of information. Many sites on the internet offer the opportunity to legally purchase (and in some cases download for free) music, movies, and games. An organization called EDUCAUSE has compiled a list of sources of legal alternatives for downloading media content, which can be found at: https://www.educause.edu/focus -areas-and- initiatives/policy -and-security/educause -policy/legal- sources- online . The University does not guarantee the accuracy of this list or the availability of the sources listed. 141 Revised April 2021 Copyright Infringe ment Compliance Pl an Introduction In accordance with the Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) of 2008, Florida National University has d eveloped and implemented a plan to effectively combat the unauthorized distribution of material, the copyright in and to which may be owned by a third party, by users of the institution's network without unduly interfering with the educational and research use of the network. The following plan contains or addresses: 1. The use of technology-based deterrents; 2. An educ ational component regarding appropriate and inappropri ate use of copyrighted materials; 3. A description of the institution's policy and procedures for handling co pyright infringement; and 4. A required periodic review of the plan. Use of Techn ology-Based Deterrents Florida National University uses a number of technical means to monitor peer-to-peer file sharing on i ts network. Information that is maintained includes records of peer-to- peer file sharing sessi ons of all Faculty, Staff and Students. This information includes source and destination information, usernames, files being transferred, and information on the peer-to-peer application being us ed. When peer-to-peer traffic is observed on the network the file being transferred is identified and comp ared against an extensive database of known content (Movies, TV shows, Music, Software, etc.) that is subject to a claim of copyright protection. If the content is identified as being protected, the web browser of the comp uter in question will be redirected to an Anti-Piracy Information page where the end user will be informed that they are uploading or downloading protected material. The Anti-Piracy notice will provide the end user w ith examples of the works infringed and inform them of legal means to download such content. In add ition, application firewalls are enabled for all zones, which trigger general monitoring at three campus firewalls. The firewall has a signature group of common peer-to-peer apps and as new signatures are introduced, they are added to this group. These firewalls generate alerts that show up in logs, which are monitored on the firewall log viewer and via the GMS portal. Educational Plan for Electronic Copyright Protection The Student Services De partment, in cooperation with the VP of Academic Affairs will provide yearly notification to students, staff and faculty of the college's intellectual prope rty proced ures. Additional information regarding appropri ate use of copyrighted materials will be di stributed to faculty, staff, and students as they are developed. The Student Services department will address FNU's Copyright Infringement Policies dur ing Orientation. 142 Revised April 2021 The VP of Academic Affairs will publish in t he FNU Catalog the University's policy on the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material, including resources for legally obtaining co ntent authored by a third party. Description of Institution's Procedures for Handling Copyright Infringement Introduction This plan and these procedures (the \"Plan\") are promulgated i n compliance with Title 17 of the United States Code, 18 USC \u00a7 2319, the No Elec tronic Theft Act, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and all other applicable copyright laws and regulations (collectively the \"Laws\") pertaining to educational institutions. Florida National University (the \"University\") complies with all applicable Laws, and nothing contained herein is intended to be a violation of those rights and responsibilities. The terms of this Plan shall yield to the Laws as and where required. The duties and obligations imposed by this Plan shall be in additio n to and not a limitation of any duties or obligations otherwise imposed by the Laws. For purposes of this Plan, \"Information Technology Resources\" shall refer to (but shall not be limited to) any and all University facilities, devices, peripherals, applic ations, services, networks, accounts, and resources used for or in connection with the University's processing, transfer, storage, access, and/or dissemination of information.

Removing or alteri ng any copyright or other intellectual property notices shall be strictly prohibited. Individuals using the Information Technology Resources (or any portion thereof) , the lib rary, and/or any other academic resources at the University are respons ible for complying with all applicable c opyright laws and the University 's polici es and procedures regarding the use of copyrighted mate rials. The University requires its students, faculty, and staff to educate themselv es on the principles of copyright, to respect the rights of copyright owne d by othe rs, and to comply with all applicable laws pertaining thereto. Note: All content produced by University employees on or with the Information Technology Resources are the property of the University. Notification, Investigation, and Removal Procedure s In the case of copyright infringement by a student, faculty or staff member, the University reserves the rights to deny, limit, or revoke access to the Information Technology Resources or to impose other sanctions at its discretion. (See the end of this Plan for procedures on copyright infringement concerning language, literature, or media other than Information Technology Resources .) Once a determination of copyright infringement has b een made under the Procedure for Investigation and Dispositi on of Copyright Infringement Allegations, the matter will be referred to the appropriate authori ty as defined below. The Office of Stude nt Services, using the student conduct policies in the University Catalog, S tudent Handbook, and applicable program -specific handbooks as guidelines, will 143 Revised April 2021 deal with student violations of this Plan and the University's Policy of Unauthorized Distribution of Copyrighted Materials. Faculty violations of this Plan will be dealt with by the appropriate Division Head and other relevant University officials. Staff violations of this Plan will be dealt with by the appropriate supervisor and other relevant University officials. The procedures outlined below will apply when the University receives written notification of an alleged copyright infringement. Notifi cation of Infringement by Copyright Holder Copyright holders who believe a student, faculty or staff member has infringed their copyrighted material must not ify the University's Vice President of Academic Affairs (the \"Designated Agent\") of the a llegedly infringing action or material in writing. For purposes of these procedures, an email message from the copyright holder shall be consid ered a written notice, provided that the copyright holder alleging such in fringement is identified, and is willing to provide additional signed document ation of his/her claim. The notification must: Identify the copyrighted material being infringed in sufficient detail to permit the University to loc ate the allegedly infringing material on the University's Information Technology Resources; State the basis for the claim of possib le infringem ent; and State the ba sis for the copyright holder's copyright in the w ork (e.g., author, owne r, assignee). Notifi cation of Student, Faculty or Staff Member of Allegation of Copyright Infringement The Designated Agent will notify the student, faculty or staff member who appears to have posted the allegedly infringing material that an invest igation procedure will be conduc ted according to this Plan. Procedure for Investigation and Dispos ition of Copyright Infringement Allegations In the event that the allegedly infringing material is being used by a faculty or staff member for a class or function at the University, the Designated Agent will attempt to secure an arrangement with the copyright holder for use of the allegedly infringing material until the end of the current academic term. For allegedly infringing uses by students related to University classes or functions, the Designated Agent may, at the University's option, attempt to secure such an arrangement with the copyright holder on a fee-free basis. Failing a satisfactory arrangement, the Designated Agent will notify the student, faculty or staff member and conduct an invest igation of the alleged infringement, and will take action as set forth below regarding any allegedly infringing material. If, after the invest igation, the Designated Agent determines that the allegedly infringing material appears not to infringe on the copyright of the copyright holder, the Designated Agent will notify the copyright holder and the student, faculty or staff member of this determination. If the copyright holder disa grees with the determination of the Designated Agent, the copyright holder may request in writing that the University ask its attorneys to render an opinion as to whether the allegedly infringing material const itutes copyright infringement. If the material is determined not to constitute copyright infringement, the material will remain on the Information Technology Resources . 144 Revised April 2021 If, after conducting an invest igation, the Designated Agent determines that the allegedly infringing mat erial appears to infringe the copyright of the holder, the Designated Agent, working with the appropriate authori ty, will follow the procedures for removal of infringing material set forth below. Removal of Infringing Material If, after the Designated Agent's investi gation, the d etermination is made that the allegedly infringing material appea rs to infringe the copyright of the holde r, the Designated Agent will not ify the copyright holder and the student, faculty or staff member whose account was used to post the allegedly infringing material. The Designated Agent will direct the appropriate University I T staff memb er to remove, or block access to, the allegedly infringing material, and will notify additional University authorities as appropriate. Upon receipt of notification from the Designated Agent that the allegedly infringing material appears to infringe the copyright of the copyright holder and is being blocked or removed from the University's Information Technology Resources, the student, faculty or staff member may request that the Designated Agent restore the removed or blocked material based on the student, faculty or staff member 's belief that the allegedly infringing material is not infringing. Such a request must be in writing and include a detailed statement of the ba sis for the student, faculty or staff member 's belief that the allegedly infringing material is not inf ringing, as well as a request to the Designated Agent that the removed or block ed material be restored. If the Designated Agent receives such a request from the student, faculty or staff member , the Designated Agent, in consultation with the appropriate University authori ty, may provide a copy of the request to the copyright holder and to the University's attorneys, if the attorneys have not already provided counsel on the matter. If, with in ten d ays after a copy of the student, faculty or staff member 's request is sent to the copyright holder by the Designated Agent, the Designated Agent has not received a written request from the copyright holder to continue the blocking or removal of the allegedly infringing material, the Designated Agent will notify the University's IT department to restore the material so long as the University's attorneys, if they have been consulted, agree that the material does not constitute an infringement of copyright. The University's IT department may restore the allegedly infringing material within four (4) days of the receipt of such notification and the material may be downloaded again by the student, faculty or staff member. If the Designated Agent receives, within ten (10) days, a request from the copyright holder to continue the blocking or removal of the allegedly infringing material, the Designated Agent may provide copies of all corresponde nce to the University's attorneys. Notification of this request from the copyright holder will also be sent to the student, faculty or staff member who had appealed the original decision regarding the alleged copyright infringement, and to the appropriate University authorit y. The University's attorneys may be asked to provide counsel as to whether the allegedly infringing material constitutes copyright infringement. If the allegedly infringing material is reviewed by the University's attorneys and determined not to constitute copyright infringement, the material may be restored by the University's IT department within four (4) d ays of such determination and the material may be downloaded again by the student, faculty or staff member. 145 Revised April 2021 Procedures Involving Alleged Copyright Infringement Conce rning Language, Literature, or Media other than Information Technology Resources Questions of alleged copyright infringement concerning language, literature, and media other than in connection with the University's Information Technology Resources wi ll also be invest igated by the established Designated Agent. The Designated Agent will follow procedures and adhere to policies that are similar to t hose outlined above (f or Information Technology Resources ) to ascertain if the fair use provisions of the Laws h ave been infringed upon. Blockin g or removal of material determined to constitute copyright infringem ent will be handled in a mann er determined to be appropriate for each such a rea, as will re storation of material that is determined, through the appeal process, not to const itute copyright inf ringem ent. Designation of Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement This is to notify copyright holders that the following person has been designated by Florida National University to serve as Designated Agent, and to receive requests concerning claimed copyright infringement, pursua nt to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act: Dr. Anthony Berrios , Vice President of A cademic Affairs (academicaffairs @fnu.edu) Any copyright holder wishing to send a notice to Florida National University regarding possible copyright infringement should file that notice in writing with the Designated Agent at the following address, or at the email address listed above: Florida Nat ional University 4425 W est Jose Regueiro (20th) Ave Hialeah, Florida 33012 Periodic Review This Plan will be reviewed annually. 146 Revised April 2021 Academic Grading System a nd Transcript Code Key Official grades and their quality points equivalency at FNU are as shown on the table below . The final grade of a course shall be based on various criteria; however, the individual instructor establishes the weight of each assignment for determining the final grade and this information is given in the course syllabus of which every student shall receive a copy. ACADEMIC GRADING SYSTEM and TRANSCRIPT CODE KEY Letter Grade Numerical Value Quality Points Superior Achievement A (90 - 100) 4.00 Very Good B+ (85 - 89) 3.50 Good B (80 - 84) 3.00 Above Average C+ (75 - 79) 2.50 Average C (70 - 74) 2.00 Passing D (60 -69) 1.00 Failure F (0 - 59) 0.00 Satisfactory S ------- Passing grade for remedial courses Unsatisfactory U ------- Failure grade for remedial courses Incomplete I Student did not complete the required work for reasons accepted by the instructor. Withdrawal Military WML Withdrawal for military students or their spouse Withdrawal with Penalty WP Withdraws after the add -drop period Withdrawal - no class Participation Module B WX Withdrawal with no class participation on Module B, will not be part of GPA. Audit AU No grades; no quality points. Transferred Credit TC Credit is granted for equivalent course; external or internal transferability. Withdrawal with Failure WF Student did not complete the required class work. Unsatisfactory Withdrawal WU Student did not complete the required class work for remedial courses. TRANSCRIPT CODES Credit by Examination CE Subject to Registrar's authorization. Guided Studies GS Subject to Registrar's authorization. Placement by Testing PT For the ESL programs. 147 Revised April 2021 Failure (F) An \"F\" is a grade; it counts for the GPA. It alters the completion date of the program; it also increases the student's financial burden. An \"F\" may not be erased, but the course can be repeated to improve the GPA. The latest grade for the course prevails. A student may continue to receive federal financial aid for any course failed as long as the student is otherwise eligible. In the Associate of Science in Nursing Program and the Associate of Science in P hysical Therapist Assistant, the lowest acceptable grade is an 80 % (B). Anything below an 80% is considered failure. Incomplete (I) Use of this grade is very restricted and only on the basis of extenuating circumstances in the judgment of the instructor. When a student is not able to complete the course requirements within the length of the course for reasons acceptable to the instruc tor, the instructor may assign an \"Incomplete\" on terms specified by the instructor. An \"I\" is valid for only one TERM ; after this it becomes an \"F.\" During the waiting period, an \"I\" is listed as credit hours attempted, but not completed. The instructor will prepare a modified final exam or an appropriate assignment and leave it in a sealed envelope with the department head or division head. The department head or division head or an instructor designated by them will proctor and score the exam in accordance with FNU policy. The same will apply to written papers waiting to be graded as part of a final grade. The instructor may calculate the course average by using \"0\" for each of the components of the final grade that has not been satisfied. (The course syllabus will list the components of the final grade for that course, or the instructor will otherwise stipulate these ). Withdrawals (WP, WF , WU , WML ) Students desiring to withdraw formally from a class may do so within the add- drop period without penalty. A reduction in course load may keep the student from meeting minimum standards for satisfact ory progress . Course withdrawals may also jeopardize the student's financial aid eligibility, VA benefits, and program completion date. The ADD/DROP period is the first week of the semester (TERM A) ending Thursday of that week. During this time, you can add, change, or cancel classes, by following the procedure established. Classes withdrawn within this period will receive be unregistered from the student load. Requests to change, add or cancel classes must be made in writing by means of the Cancel/Add form or the Class Change form found on the FNU website or at the Registrar's Office. Any changes to your schedule must be approved by your Department/Division Head and a Cancel/Add form or Class Change form must be completed, signed, and turned into the Registrar's Office. Distance Learning students must submit the completed form(s) to the Registrar's Office via either e -mail to registrars@fnu.edu or fax at 148 Revised April 2021 (305) 362-0595, Attention to: Registrar's Office. Additional questions about the Distance Learning Department can be emailed to distancelearning@fnu.edu . No schedule changes will be accepted for the semester during Term B unless it is an emergency, and you will be charged for the change. For changes approved after the ADD/DROP period, the student will be charged $50.00 per change. If a student wants to change a class during Term B, it can only be done by substituting the class with another course carrying the same credit load and by paying the $50.00 fee. Please note that all changes carry a $50.00 fee even if it just a change of session. Students starting in the University in Term B of the semester will be able to ADD/ CHANGE classes during the first week of this term (until Thursday of that week) . Late Withdrawal: Any withdrawal after the Add- drop period incurs full financial obligation. The student will receive a \"WP\" if the withdrawal is made between the second week of classes up to the mid -term. \"WP\" does not affect GPA. \"WF\" is assigned after the midterm when the student does not complete the course requirements. \"WF affects GPA. \"WU\" is assigned after the midterm, when the student does not complete the course requirements for remedial courses. \"WU\" does not affect GPA. Withdrawal From The Universi ty To officially withdraw from the University , the students must fill out a Withdrawal Form. This form is available at the Registrar's Office or can be downloaded from the FNU website. It must be completely filled out and submitted to the Registrar's Of fice. Distance Learning students must submit the completed form to the Registrar's Office via either e -mail to registrars@fnu.edu or fax at (305) 362 0595, Attention to: Registrar's Office. Additional questions ab out the Distance Learning Department can be emailed to distancelearning@fnu.edu . The student should meet with the Advising Office and his/her career advisor (Department or Division Head) before processing a withdrawal. No withdrawal is official until the student receives an acknowledgement from the Registrar's Office. Any withdrawal after the ADD/DROP period is subject to financial implications. Audit (AU) The student who audits a course attends without expecting credit or formal recognition. The campus dean and the instructor must grant permission for the student to audit the course. Transferred Credit (TC) Credit for external or internal transferab le coursework is granted for grades of \" C\" or better. College courses completed more than five years prior to the date of enrollment at FNU will not be accepted . A student who wishes to change from one program to another should consult with ( a) the Division Head or faculty advisor (b) the registrar, (c) the financial aid advisor in order to become fully aware of the best possible use of credits earned, of allocated monies, of necessary changes in the enrollment application, and of any other possible implication. All courses that can be transferred to the new program, as 149 Revised April 2021 either part of the required block or as electives, will be reflected in the student's ledger, in the student's transcripts , and in the Summary Sheet in the Academic File. All transfer of credit must be made effective at the time of registration or within the student's first semester of enrollment. Grade point averages are not transferred; but cours es transferred will appear on the student's transcripts with their respective/earned grades. Exper iential Learning Credits Experiential learning credits may be transferred to satisfy course requirements. Any experiential learning credit that a student receives will appear on their official transcript and will show that a degree requirement has been met. The maximum number of c redits earned by examination will be fifteen (15). The credit will be marked as TC and will specify the equivalent course code and name. Credit is awarded based on measurable course learning outcomes presented through a portfolio. Credit b y Examination (C E) Students may receive credit by examination. The Campus Dean will evaluate each case, and the appropriate academic department will proctor and score the exams. The student will be graded \"S\" if scoring 70% or better, otherwise \"U\". The result of this e xam cannot be challenged again. Application forms are available from the Registrar. Institutional credit by examination will become a part of the student's permanent record at the conclusion of the semester in which it is awarded; grades will count toward graduation requirements and they will be entered with a CE on the student's transcripts . A fee per credit hour will be charged for each exami nation administered. The maximum number of credits earned by exam ination will be nine (9). Please be advised that the Federal Pell Grant does not cover credit by examination, just credits earned on the basis of regular class attendance. This process will be documented in the Academic Summary Sheet inside the student's academic file. Credit by examination may not be used to eliminate an \"F \" or \"I\" grade. Special Individualized Studies (SI S) A special study is offered only in certain circumstances. They are conducted in a hybrid method or administered online by the Department or Division Head. Degree -seeking students can take a maximum of six credits in special individualized studies, supported by a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 GPA. The VP of Academic Affairs and the campus Dean will give approval for such stud ies. After this, SI S students are under the supervision and taught by the Department Head or Division Head. 150 Revised April 2021 ESL Placement b y Testing Upon enrollment, the ESL program uses a placement test for new students, and they are placed in the corresponding level according to their performance (score) on this test. There is no fee for the placement test. Repeating Courses Students may repeat courses taken at Florida National University to improve the cumulative grade point average. The credit is given for the last grade earned when repeating a course. Repeated courses will appear on the student's transcript. The first attempt will also be shown, but the cumulative grade point average will be computed based on the last attempt only. In the case of repeating a course to improve the GPA, tuition fees will be entirely the student's responsibility. In the evaluation of satisfactory progress, in addition to the minimum credits earned and grade point averag e each time they are taken, repeated courses will be counted as credits attempted. When successfully com pleted, they will count as credits earned. A student f ailing a course may still be eligible for financial aid upon repeating it. The student must seek advice at the Financial Aid office. Request f or Grade Review Policy & Procedure A student may challenge a final course grade if the student has a reasonable belief that the grade was assigned due to an error in the course grade book, grade calculations, o r grade submission. The Procedures for a Grade Review are as follows: 1. The student will request the final grade review from the course faculty, by utilizing the Request for Grade Review Form. 2. The Request for Grade Review form must be submitted within 30 calendar days from the end of the Term, for the course that the student wants the grade reviewed.

This numbering system is used by all public postsecondary institutions in Florida and by participating nonpublic institutions. The major purpose of this system is to facilitate the transfer of courses betwe en participating institutions. Students and administrators can use the online SCNS to obtain course descriptions and specific information about course transfer between participating Florida institutions. This information is at the SCNS website at https://flscns.fldoe.org/ . Each participating institution controls the title, credit, and content of its own courses and recommends the first digit of the course number to indicate the level at which students normally take the course. Course prefixes and the last three digits of the course numbers are assigned by members of faculty discipline committees appointed for that purpose by the Florida Department of Education in Tallahassee. Individuals nominated to serve on th ese committees are selected to maintain a representative balance as to type of institution and discipline field or specialization. The course prefix and each digit in the course number have a meaning in the SCNS. The listing of prefixes and associated co urses is referred to as the \"SCNS taxonomy.\" Descriptions of the content of courses are referred to as \"statewide course profiles.\" Example of Course Identifier Prefix Level Code Century Digit Decade Digit Unit Digit Lab Code (first digit) (second digit) (third digit) (fourth digit) ENC 1 1 0 1 English Lower (Freshman) Freshman Freshman Freshman No laboratory Composition Level at this Composition Composition Composition component in institution Skills Skills I this course General Rule for Course Equivalencies Equivalent courses at different institutions are identified by the same prefixes and same last three digits of the course number and are guaranteed to be transferable 156 Revised April 2021 between participating institutions that offer the course, with a few exceptions, as listed below in Exceptions to the General Rule for Equivalency . For example, a freshman composition skills course is offered by 84 different public and nonpublic postsecondary institutions. Each institution uses \"ENC_101\" to identify its freshman composition skills course. The level code is the first digit and represents the year in which students normally take the course at a specific institution. In the SCNS taxonomy, \"ENC\" means decade digit \"0\" represents Composition Skills,\" and the unit digit \"1\" represents \"Freshman Composition Skills I.\" In the sciences and certain other areas, a \"C\" or \"L\" after the course number is known as a lab i ndicator. The \"C\" represents a combined lecture and laboratory course that meets in the same place at the same time. The \"L\" represents a laboratory course or the laboratory part of a course that has the same prefix and course number but meets at a diffe rent time or place. Transfer of any successfully completed course from one participating institution to another is guaranteed in cases where the course to be transferred is equivalent to one offered by the receiving institution. Equivalencies are establ ished by the same prefix and last three digits and comparable faculty credentials at both institutions. For example, ENC 1101 is offered at a community college. The same course is offered at a state university as ENC 2101. A student who has successfull y completed ENC 1101 at a Florida College System institution is guaranteed to receive transfer credit for ENC 2101 at the state university if the student transfers. The student cannot be required to take ENC 2101 again since ENC 1101 is equivalent to ENC 2101. Transfer credit must be awarded for successfully completed equivalent courses and used by the receiving institution to determine satisfaction of requirements by transfer students on the same basis as credit awarded to the native students. It is the prerogative of the receiving institution, however, to offer transfer credit for courses successfully completed that have not been designated as equivalent. NOTE : Credit generated at institutions on the quarter- term system may not transfer the equivalent number of credits to institutions on the semester -term system. For example, 4.0 quarter hours often transfers as 2.67 semester hours. The Course Prefix The course prefix is a three -letter designator for a major division of an academic discipline, subject matter area, or subcategory of knowledge. The prefix is not intended to identify the department in which a course is offered. Rather, the content of a course determines the assigned prefix to identify the course. 157 Revised April 2021 Authority for Acceptance of Equivalent Co urses Section 1007.24(7), Florida Statutes, states: Any student who transfers among postsecondary institutions that are fully accredited by a regional or national accrediting agency recognized by the United States Department of Education and that participa te in the statewide course numbering system shall be awarded credit by the receiving institution for courses satisfactorily completed by the student at the previous institutions. Credit shall be awarded if the courses are judged by the appropriate statewide course numbering system faculty committees representing school districts, public postsecondary educational institutions, and participating nonpublic postsecondary educational institutions to be academically equivalent to courses offered at the receiving institution, including equivalency of faculty credentials, regardless of the public or nonpublic control of the previous institution. The Department of Education shall ensure that credits to be accepted by a receiving institution are generated in courses f or which the faculty possess credentials that are comparable to those required by the accrediting association of the receiving institution. The award of credit may be limited to courses that are entered in the statewide course numbering system. Credits awa rded pursuant to this subsection shall satisfy institutional requirements on the same basis as credits awarded to native students. 158 Revised April 2021 Exceptions to the General Rule for Equivalency Since the initial implementation of the SCNS, specific disciplines or types of courses have been excepted from the guarantee of transfer for equivalent courses. These include courses that must be evaluated individually or courses in which the student must be evaluated for mastery of skill and technique. The following cours es are exceptions to the general rule for course equivalencies and may not transfer. Transferability is at the discretion of the receiving institution. A. Courses not offered by the receiving institution. B. For courses at non- regionally accredited institutions , courses offered prior to the established transfer date of the course in question. C. Courses in the _900 -999 series are not automatically transferable, and must be evaluated individually. These include such courses as Special Topics, Internships, Apprentice ships, Practic ums, Study Abroad, Theses, and Dissertations. D. Applied academics for adult education courses. E. Graduate courses. F. Internships, apprenticeships, practicums , clinical experiences, and study abroad courses with numbers other than those ranging from 900-999. G. Applied courses in the performing arts (Art, Dance, Interior Design, Music, and Theatre) and skills courses in Criminal Justice (academy certificate courses) are not guaranteed as transferable. These courses need evidence of achievement (e.g., portfolio, audition, interview, etc.). Courses from Non-regionally Accredited Institutions The SCNS makes available on its home page (http://scns.fldoe.org) a report entitled \"Courses at Non- Regionally Accredited Institutions\" that contains a comprehensive listing of all nonpublic institution courses in the SCNS inventory, as well as each course's transfer level and transfer effective date. This report is updated monthly. Questions about the SCNS and appeals regarding course credit transfer decisions shoul d be directed to the University's Office of Publications or to the Florida Department of Education, Office of Articulation, 1401 Turlington Building, Tallahassee, Florida 32399 - 0400.
