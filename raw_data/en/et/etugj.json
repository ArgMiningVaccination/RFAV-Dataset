A quick google search of the word \"holistic\" will render many things. Images of lotus flowers, yoga poses and chakras will fill your screen. You'll be offered spa services, Ayurveda, and maybe even see a listing for a cannabis dispensary. While those images and services may not necessarily be indicative of new age practices, it can leave one wondering if \"holistic\" has a place in the life of the believer. I have had to wrestle with the implications of what holistic wellness means. By training, I am a Certified Natural Health Professional, having studied at a school with a Christian founder. And while this school is rooted in the faith and offers advanced biblical studies in health, it also teaches herbology, iridology, and Traditional Chinese Medicine, among many other wellness modalities. As a wellness practitioner, I've had to parse through many schools of thought to formulate my own conclusions. And I'm grateful that the Holy Spirit continues to lead me on my personal journey of wellness and in providing care to others. Defining the Terms So what is holistic wellness? And when you hear the term holistic wellness, what comes to your mind? Before beginning to determine if holistic wellness is biblical, we must first establish working definitions for both holistic wellness and new age. Holistic is a term often used in the wellness space. It is characterized by treating the whole person. Holistic wellness then looks at the person as a whole, factoring in one's physical, mental, social/emotional, and environmental aspects. Holistic wellness recognizes the interdependence of all the dimensions of our health. It acknowledges that in order for us to be in health and prosper even as our souls prosper, we need not only focus on the physical body but to look at the sum of the constitution of our personhood. Holistic wellness gives us the opportunity to take a macro as opposed to a micro look at what impacts the whole being. I have found that some Christians have a strong bias against things they perceive as new age. This lends itself to lumping anything not explicitly stated in Scripture to be labeled new age. For the sake of today's discussion, let us get a working definition of what the term new age means. New Age is a wide range of spiritual and or religious practices and philosophies which flourished rapidly in the early 1970's. Some of the practices are viewed as paranormal or metaphysical. Some new age practices are often drawn from Eastern philosophies. The Biblical Definition of Holistic Wellness The Bible admonishes the Believer to walk circumspectly ( [Ephesians 5:15](https://www.biblestudytools.com/ephesians/5-15.html)), and that is definitely applicable when it comes to our overall health and well-being. On our quest for optimal wellness, we must consider this caution from [Colossians 2:8](https://www.biblestudytools.com/colossians/2-8.html): \"See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ.\" And when one is searching for healing, this is especially important. The desperation to be delivered from a debilitating illness or wanting freedom from the weight of a spirit of heaviness can drive one to seek out whatever avenues promise a solution. Having personally dealt with an autoimmune condition for over 20 years, I know firsthand the desperation for wanting to be made whole. Let us return to that working definition of holistic in light of the Word. Recall that holistic wellness means looking at and treating the whole person. And is this not how God created us? I love the way the Masterlife curriculum by Avery T. Willis and Kay Moore describes our personhood. In Book 2 of Masterlife, The Disciple's Personality, it describes man's origin and personality. It highlights that God made us physical and spiritual. It goes on to beautifully illustrate how we are spirit, body, and soul. So when God seeks to work on us and in us, He does so wholly. The Apostle Paul reminds us of this in [1 Thessalonians 5:23](https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-thessalonians/5-23.html), saying, \"And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord [Jesus Christ](https://www.christianity.com/jesus/).\" The Bible presents a whole-person approach to healing. We can see this illustrated in Jesus' healings. Not only did Jesus heal physical ailments, but He addressed the issue of the mind and the soul. \"And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them\" ( [Matthew 4:24](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/4-24.html)). As a holistic health coach, I have observed how one's thinking can result in sickness within the physical body. I myself have seen its effects in working with clients and in my own body. Treating a person cannot be done effectively when siloed. It requires coordinated care, and that comes through a holistic approach. Holistic wellness is very much biblical. The Bible renders clear instructions on how we are to treat and care for our whole selves. There are over 100 verses that address thoughts and/or the mind. And we are given instructions on how to honor the body. We are taught in the Word how to manage our emotions. This is holistic wellness in action. When we examine many of the roots of healing modalities that some Christians may deem new age, we will find biblical truth at the center. Some may find herbology new age but the bible is clear that plants are for our nourishment ( [Genesis 1:29](https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/1-29.html)) and that leaves on the trees are for healing ( [Ezekiel 47:12](https://www.biblestudytools.com/ezekiel/47-12.html)). Some may find reflexology new age, yet we see the Apostle Paul lay hands on the father of Publius and he is healed. Some may find issues with iridology, but in the sermon on the Mount, Jesus addresses the eye and explains that the eye is the lamp of the body. Discerning True, Godly Holistic Wellness Perhaps some of the confusion about holistic wellness being biblical or new age lies in the enemy's age-old practice of deceit. This is central to how he operates. He often takes the truth and distorts it. He takes what God meant for good and warps it. Just like he took what God said and presented it back to Eve with distortion, still today he takes what God intended for our good, in this case, holistic wellness, he skews it every so slightly. As a caution, I would add, before discounting a treatment modality as new age, I urge you to pray and seek the Lord. The same can be said of the conventional approaches we take with doctors, prescriptions, therapy, etc. It should all be presented before God, relying on the Holy Spirit to be our guide in making decisions regarding our total well-being. I've heard whispers that certain wellness modalities are a no-no for Christians. Most often, I generally don't see the same level of scrutiny or examination given to conventional medicine even though we don't know our doctors' faith practices and we don't know what's in the pharmaceuticals we take, yet we just accept those offerings as truth. I would say to study the Scriptures and seek the Lord when deciding which healing course to pursue, keeping in mind that He is the Lord who heals you ( [Exodus 15:26](https://www.biblestudytools.com/exodus/15-26.html)). Let us walk boldly in the knowledge that holistic wellness is biblical, and it is God's will for our lives. Jesus tells us directly that He came so we might have life and have it more abundantly ( [John 10:10](https://www.biblestudytools.com/john/10-10.html)). Taking the holistic wellness approach has deepened my relationship with Christ. It has caused me to dig further into His Word to see what He says about healing the mind and the body. It has compelled me to present my body as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to Him ( [Romans 12:1](https://www.biblestudytools.com/romans/12-1.html)). It has thrust me headlong into implementing daily practices that align with God's promises for my total health and well-being. And I trust that it can do the same for you.
