With support from a U.S. Environmental Protection Age ncy (EPA) grant, the Washington State Department of Ecolo gy (Ecology) also studied metals in fertilizers, soil amendments, and soils. The results from these studies are included in this report.Objectives of the studies included:1. Quantify metal and dioxin concentrations in fertilizer products 2. Determine if certain metals have accumulated in agricultural soils of the Columbia Basin 3. Provide an initial assessment of typical concentrations of dioxins in Washington soils To satisfy these objectives, Ecology, in cooperation with the state Department of Agriculture and the state Department of Health:1. Sampled fertilizer products to determine metal and dioxin concentrations 2. Analyzed metal concentrations of agricultural and non-agricultural soils in the Columbia Basin 3. Sampled soils in open, forest, and urban areas for dioxins The Studies 1. Metals and Dioxins in Fertilizer Products Fifty fertilizer products - including bulk agricultural fertilizers, home-use fertilizers, agricultural micronutrient products, and a soil amendment - were sampled for eight h eavy metals and 17 types of dioxins. The most frequen tly analyzed products were home-use fertilizers, which include a wide variety of products.Fertilizer products were analyzed for total me tals. Leachable metals were evaluated using the Toxicity Characteris tic Leaching Proce dure (TCLP). TCLP is used to designate dangerous wastes under the Washington State Dangerous Waste Regulations. T CLP is being use d b Ecology as a screening criterion to evaluate whether waste-derived fertilizers meet applicable standards. Results of this ana lysis indicate that TCLP is an adequate screening criterion for predicting whether fertilizers are in compliance with dangerous waste regulations.Two bulk agricultural fertilizers, four home-use fertilizers, and one agricultural micronutrientproduct failed T CLP screening for cadmium. Concentrations of cadmium in these products ranged from 1.04 to 2.52 parts per million (ppm), compared to the federal and state criteria of1.0 ppm for designation of dangerous waste. Two products tested had been made from steel millflue dust (K061), which is classified as a dangerous waste under Washington State regulation s. However, steel mill flue dust is currently exempt from dangerous waste rules when used in fertilizer products. Ecolog y proposes to eliminate the K061 exemption, through the rule-making process.Page xviMost fertilizer products had non-detectable or extremely low levels of dioxin; 72% had less than one-tenth of one part per trillion (pptr) toxic equivalents (TEQs). Two products had re Trace Elements (54 pptr).These two products are believed to contain steel mill flue dust, and had higher TEQs than any ofthe soils sampled during this study. The manufacturing process for Frit F-503G has used a non-hazardous-waste source of zinc since 1988, although it is unknown when the sample product wasmanufactured. Most of the fertilizer products sampled had lower dioxin TEQs than the soils surveyed. The concentration of dioxin in soils after fertilizer products are applied depends on the applicationrate. When applied at recommended rates, these products add a minimal amount of dioxin tosoil. Dioxins accumulate in biosolids (sewage sludge) and have been measured in nearly all biosolids tested. The national data available on dioxin levels in biosolids are more than ten years old, andthere are few biosolids data for Washington State. Review of statewide biosolids data andadditional sampling are needed. Metals are also found in biosolids, but metals in biosolids werenot evaluated in this report. 2. Metals in Soils Thirty-three sites were sampled in the Columbia Basin, primarily in Grant County. To the extentpossible, agricultural sites were matched with non-agricultural sites of the same soil type.Twenty agricultural soils and 13 non-agricultural soils were tested. Fields with historicalapplications of biosolids or lead arsenate pesticides were excluded from this study. Zinc and cadmium concentrations in agricultural soils show small but statistically significant increases when compared to non-agricultural soils. The zinc-to-cadmium ratio suggests plantswill take up zinc before cadmium. Increased cadmium levels in agricultural fields may be due tofarming practices used over the last 50 years. The increased zinc and cadmium concentrationssuggest no soil quality impairment, because the values found are at the lower end of the range ofconcentrations found in non-agricultural soils. Levels of arsenic, copper, mercury, nickel, lead, total organic carbon, pH, total phosphorus, and cation exchange capacity in soils do not show statistically significant differences betweenagricultural and non-agricultural sites. The apparent increase in zinc and cadmiumconcentrations indicates a need to periodically monitor soils. Monitoring the rate of increase ofmetals in agricultural soils will provide information to allow Washington fertilizer standards tobe adjusted, so concentrations of metals in agricultural soils do not reach a level of concern. 3. Dioxins in Soils Thirty soil samples were collected from urban, open, and forested lands and tested for 17 formsof dioxins. All soil samples, including samples from remote wilderness areas, had detectablelevels of dioxins. In general, average dioxin levels appear to be higher in urban areas than inforested and open areas. Dioxin concentrations ranged from 0.033 to 19.5 pptr TEQ. SamplePage xviisites in the city of Tacoma had the two highest dioxin concentrations (9.5, 19.5 pptr TEQ). Forest soils appear to have concentrations greater than soils from open areas. Concentrations ofdioxins detected in Washington State soils are comparable to the results of studies in Spain,Germany, and Austria. The pattern of dioxin forms in biosolids and soils is similar. However, these soil \"signatures\" do not coincide exactly with any of the source signatures evaluated. The closest correlations appearto be with the dioxin congeners associated with and biosolids. Theapparent correlation between soils and biosolids signatures may be due to the similarity insources contributing to these receptors. Much additional work is needed (e.g., tests of additionalsource types, understanding changes in signatures caused by weathering of soils) before therelative dioxin contribution of various sources can be well understood. It is likely, however, that multiple sources are involved and that air-borne dispersion, transport, and deposition areimportant mechanisms in the contamination of soil. The original study design included sampling agricultural soils for dioxins. However, due to difficulties in randomly selecting agricultural sites and an inability to guarantee confidentiality tolandowners, this part of the study was postponed. Ecology will sample agricultural soils fordioxin in April-May 1999. Results of that study will be published as an addendum to this report. Recommendations and Actions Washington State departments of Ecology, Health, and Agriculture recommend: Continue to implement The Fertilizer Regulation Act by ongoing review, sampling, and analysis of fertilizer products for metals, as specified under the Memorandum ofUnderstanding among these agencies. In the biennial report to the Legislature (first report due December 1, 1999), report levels of non-nutrient substances in fertilizer products. Continue to monitor levels of metals and other contaminants, as appropriate, in fertilizer products, especially waste-derived materials and phosphate fertilizers. Monitor agricultural soils to determine a rate of increase for metals in soils. Review and supplement data on dioxins in biosolids from municipalities. Monitor EPA progress on their evaluation of dioxins in biosolids. A proposed EPA rule, due in December 1999, would provide additional direction in this matter. Continue to monitor the progress of EPA and other agencies and organizations in evaluating health and environmental risks associated with fertilizer use. Monitor and review other states or countries development of standards for metals or dioxins in fertilizers or soil amendments. Determine if more sampling of dioxins in fertilizers is needed. Ecology Policy Options Ecology policy options for managing metals and dioxins in fertilizer products, as well as a discussion of the Ecology PBT initiative, are included in this report.Page xviiiBack-of-Page Placeholder for Duplex PrintingPage 1Introduction Background Concerns have been raised about whether metals and dioxins associated with waste-derived fertilizers and soil amendments pose a threat to human health and the environment. In responseto these concerns, the Washington State Department of Agriculture and the Washington StateDepartment of Ecology (Ecology) tested 55 fertilizers for 24 metals during the spring of 1997.Both waste-derived and non-waste-derived fertilizer products contain non-nutritive metals. Thisscreening study (Bowha et al., 1997) concluded that the concentration of metals in mostfertilizers tested met the Canadian standards 1 for metals in fertilizers. Additionally, a few waste- derived fertilizers suspected to contain dioxins were tested for dioxins. All of the waste-derivedproducts tested contained dioxins. Naturally occurring dolomite lime was also tested and did notcontain dioxins (Golding, 1997). As of 1997, no federal or state standards existed to regulate the level of contaminants in most fertilizer products other than those derived from known waste materials. In this report, \"fertilizerproducts\" will refer to bulk agricultural fertilizers, home-use fertilizers, micronutrients, and soilamendments. During late 1997 and early 1998, information from the state screening study wasgiven to the Fertilizer Advisory Workgroup, the Legislature, and the Governor's Office. In earl 1998, the Legislature passed Executive Request legislation (SSB 6474), The Fertilizer Regulation Act. The Act (1) adopted state standards, based on the Canadian standards, for metals in all fertilizers, (2) increased Ecology regulatory oversight of waste-derived fertilizers and soilamendments, and (3) mandated labeling for all fertilizers. The Act also mandated a study ofdioxins in fertilizers, soil amendments, and soils as well as a crop-uptake of metals study,initiated this year. These studies will give the Legislature and others information to determine iffurther fertilizer regulation is needed. Fertilizer products from natural, manufactured, and industrial by-product sources can contain \"tag-along\" substances that have little or no nutrient value. Additionally, some materialsclassified as dangerous and solid wastes under existing Ecology regulations are recycled asingredients in fertilizer products. Certain elements (e.g., zinc), as constituents of fertilizers, are recognized as nutrients required for plant life. Some metals can be potentially hazardous tag-along contaminants in fertilizers.Heavy metals have been quantified in a number of fertilizers used in Washington State(Bowhay et al., 1997). These metals are naturall occurring elements, but fertilizer use overlong periods of time may increase the metal concentrations in agricultural soils. 1 \"The Canadian Maximum Acceptable Cumulative Metal Additions to the Soil,\" Established under Trade Memorandum T-4-93, dated August 1996.Page 2 Some polychlorinated dibenzo- p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans, together referred to as \"dioxins\" in this report, also pose a potential threat to human health and theenvironment as tag-along contaminants and have been quantified in some waste-derivedfertilizers used in Washington State (Bowhay et al., 1997). The legislation signed by Governor Locke in 1998 directed Ecology, in cooperation with the state Department of Agriculture and the state Department of Health, to \"undertake a study todetermine if dioxins occur in fertilizers, soils amendments and soils and, if so, at what levels.\"(Washington State Legislature, 1998). From May through October 1998, Ecology conductedstudies to investigate (1) metals and dioxins in fertilizers and soil amendments, (2) metals insoils, and (3) dioxins in non-agricultural soils. While some conclusions may be drawn fromthese studies, their limited scope qualifies them as screening studies. They will help directfurther research, if needed, to provide information for possible regulation of these substances. This legislation also directed the state Department of Agriculture, which contracted with Washington State University, to conduct a crop-uptake study. That study, initiated in the fall of1998, will evaluate the uptake of metals in certain crops in relationship to the new Washingtonfertilizer standards. This report does not contain results of the crop-uptake of metals study. Study Objectives and Methods 1. Metals and Dioxins in Fertilizers The objective of this study was to quantify metals and dioxins in bulk agricultural fertilizers,home-use fertilizers, micronutrients, and soil amendments. In addition, available information on dioxins in biosolids was reviewed as recommended in a preliminary report (Rogowski et al.,1998). This current report uses the term \"fertilizer products\" to refer to all products sampled,which includes one soil amendment. Ecology randomly sampled and analyzed fertilizer products to determine dioxin and select metal concentrations. Zinc micronutrient fertilizers were also analyzed to determine heavy metalconcentrations, as part of an U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) grant. Metalsanalyzed were arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, selenium, and silver. Theseeight metals are a subset of the metals analyzed in the 1997 study (Bowha et al., 1997) and arethe metals of greatest concern. The fertilizer products were also analyzed for total and leachablemetals. The Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) was used to determineleachable metals. Although the TCLP is typically used to designate hazardous and dangerouswastes, this study used TCLP as a screening tool and did not use TCLP to designate fertilizerproducts as hazardous or dangerous waste. Additional total metals data for cobalt, molybdenum,nickel, and zinc have been added to this report since November 1998 (Appendix G). Results from this study will help assess the effectiveness of Ecology's waste-derived and micronutrient fertilizer screening criteria (Washington State Register, 1998); see Appendix 1-J.As required by The Fertilizer Regulation Act , Ecology developed the screening criteria to reviewPage 3fertilizer registration applications. This review will help ensure fertilizers meet the applicable federal hazardous waste and state dangerous waste regulations. 2. Metals in Soils The objective of this study was to determine if certain metals have accumulated in agriculturalsoils of the Columbia Basin. Ecology randomly sampled and analyzed metal concentrations of agricultural and non-agricultural soils in the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project and comparedthese results with results from two other state soil studies. There was an attempt to matchagricultural and non-agricultural samples by soil type. Metals analyzed were arsenic, cadmium,copper, lead, mercury, nickel, and zinc. These seven metals were selected for comparison withother applicable soil studies. \"Agricultural\" land is defined as land in active agriculturalproduction. \"Non-agricultural\" land is land that has never been farmed, tilled, or grazed. Not only are metals a concern for human health but they are also of concern for the i mpacts the may have on ecological systems. For example, contaminant-containing runoff from fields canenter aquatic environments. Organisms foraging in both terrestrial and aquatic environments,particularly if they are higher on the food chain, may be exposed to greater concentrations ofcontaminants accumulated through the food chain. Longer-lived species may bioaccumulategreater levels of certain contaminants, particularly mercury (Burger and Gochfield, 1999). 3. Dioxins in Soils The objective of this study was to provide an initial assessment of typical concentrations ofdioxins in Washington State soils. The word \"typical\" is used to describe the samples collected for this study, since the use of the term \"background\" implies a natural occurrence of thesecompounds. Ecology sampled soils in open, forest, and urban areas to determine if dioxins occurin these areas and, if so, at what levels. The original intent of a portion of this study includedsampling and analyzing agricultural soils. However, due to difficulties in randomly selectingagricultural sampling sites and not being able to guarantee confidentiality to landowners,agricultural soil collection and analysis was not conducted in 1998. Ecology will conductagricultural soil sampling during April-May 1999; the results will be published as an addendumto this report. These data were analyzed to determine relationships, if any, between the dioxins found in state soils with available dioxin data from state sources using principal components analysis.Limitations of both the source and soil data sets include largely non-random sampling and smallsample size. This effort is an initial step toward determining contributions of state dioxinsources to Washington State soils.Page 4Background Information on Arsenic, Cadmium, Lead, Mercury, and Zinc2 Arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury and zinc occur naturally in soils. Human activity hasinfluenced the distribution and chemistry of these metals in the environment. Metals associatedwith soil contamination are not very mobile and can accumulate and persist in surface soils(Alloway, 1990a). The toxicity of metals ultimately depends on the metal concentrations at the target tissue site which, in turn, relates to the amount of exposure (i.e. dose), route of exposure, and form of themetal. Metal bioavailability is mediated by physiological processes, including absorption,distribution, biotransformation, and elimination. The following section presents background information on five metals. Of the five metals described, only zinc is a nutritionally essential element. Arsenic Arsenic is naturally elevated in ground water in some parts of Washington State (DOH, 1996a).Environmental arsenic contamination is associated with the past use of pesticides, especially leadarsenate, arsenic containing wood preservatives, and metal smelters. Exposure to arsenic can affect many different organs in the body. The health effects from short- term arsenic exposures include effects on the heart, nervous system, liver, mucous membranes,and the gastrointestinal tract (ATSDR, 1998a). Chronic ingestion of arsenic is associated withcancers of the bladder, liver, kidneys, and skin (ATSDR, 1998a). Chronic inhalation of arsenichas been associated with lung cancer in smelter workers (Goyer, 1996). Cadmium Cadmium is a relatively rare metal (Alloway, 1990b). Major emissions of cadmium into theenvironment have resulted from zinc and lead mining and smelting, refining ores, combustion ofcoal and other fossil fuels, and disposal of batteries (ATSDR, 1997a). Cadmium is n aturall associated with some phosphate ores, and is commonly found in phosphate fertilizers derivedfrom phosphate ores. In general, plants take up cadmium more readily than other metals(Goyer, 1996). Cadmium accumulates in the kidney where it can remain for many years and exposure to cadmium over a long time can cause irreversible damage to the kidneys (Goyer, 1996).Cadmium affects how calcium is used by the body and cadmium exposure has been associatedwith bone deformities. Occupational exposure to airborne cadmium has been associated with 2 This section provided by the Washington State Department of HealthPage 5chronic pulmonary disease and emphysema. Cigarette smoking is a major source of cadmium exposure for the general population (Goyer, 1996). Lead While lead occurs naturally, most lead found in the environment is a result of human activities.The past use of leaded gasoline has resulted in widespread environmental lead contamination(ATSDR, 1997b). Other sources of lead in the environment include lead-based paint and leadarsenate pesticides. Children are more sensitive to the toxic effects of lead than adults and absorb and retain a greater percentage of lead into their bodies than adults (Goyer, 1996). Children are most at risk fromexposures to lead in soil and paint due to hand-mouth activity. Exposure to lead is associatedwith neurological impairment in children, including decreases in IQ scores (ATSDR, 1997b).Excessive lead exposures in adults have been associated with high blood pressure andreproductive effects (Goyer, 1996). People can have their blood tested to determine if they havehad recent exposures to lead (ATSDR, 1997b). Mercury Natural sources of mercury are predominant, although there are some notable industrial sources.Waste incineration and disposal of industrial and domestic waste products (e.g. thermometersand batteries) are sources of mercury to the environment (ATSDR, 1994a). The burning of fossilfuels also releases mercury into the environment (Goyer, 1996) Mercury has three major chemical forms: elemental, inorganic and organic. Methyl mercury, an organic form of mercury, is the most important form of mercury in terms of environmentalexposures (Goyer, 1996). Methyl mercury is produced by bacteria in the environment from otherforms of mercury. Methyl mercury accumulates in fish, where it can be a significant source ofhuman exposures. Ingestion of methyl mercury contaminated fish has been associated withneurotoxic effects. The developing fetus is very sensitive to the toxic effects of methyl mercur (Goyer, 1996). Zinc Zinc is a common element in the earth's crust and is used in numerous alloys, protective coatings(e.g. oxidation protection), dry cell batteries, wood preserving, and pharmaceutical products.Because it is also a necessary plant nutrient, it is an ingredient in some fertilizers. Major releasesinto the environment occur during mining and smelting activities, electroplating, and metalmanufacturing (ATSDR, 1994b). Zinc is a nutritionally essential metal required for maintaining health. Excessive exposure to zinc is relatively uncommon and zinc is not biologically accumulated (Goyer, 1996). Zinc ispresent in most foods. The average daily dietary intake of zinc in the U.S. ranges from 12 to 15milligrams (mg) (Goyer, 1996). The Recommended Daily Allowances (RDA) for zinc are 15Page 6mg/day for men and 12 mg/day for women (ATSDR, 1994b). Ingestion of large doses (100-150 mg) of zinc by people over a short time can cause stomach cramps and vomiting. Zinc caninterfere with the ability of the body to absorb and use other minerals such as copper and iron(DOH, 1996b). Background Information on TCLP The Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) is used to determine if a solid waste isalso a dangerous waste (chapter 173-303 WAC), and TCLP has recently been incorporated intoEcology's Review of Waste-Derived and Micronutrient Fertilizers. If a certain limits for TCLP (Appendix 1-I) and TCLP requirements apply to this fertilizer,Ecology will not recommend the fertilizer for registration. See Appendix 1-J for further details. Background Information on Dioxins Dioxins have no known industrial or commercial use. Dioxins are unintended byproductsformed during combustion of chlorinated organic compounds and the production of certainchlorinated organic compounds. They come from many sources including wood waste boilers,municipal and medical waste incinerators, and bleached pulp and paper facilities (Czuczwa andHites, 1984,Yake et al., 1998). Dioxins are found in some fertilizer products made from the recycling of industrial wastes. These tend to be micronutrients (e.g., zinc) or liming products ( Bowha et a l., 1997). Currently, there are no state standards for dioxins in fertilizer products. Dioxins are persistent environmental pollutants that accumulate, primarily through food webs, in the tissues of animals including humans. Dioxins are extremely stable, both to environmentaland biological breakdown, leading to their persistence in the environment and bioaccumulationin the food chain (Birnbaum, 1994). Because they are lipophilic and water insoluble, dioxinsconcentrate both in sediments and the fatty tissues of fish, birds, reptiles, and mammals. Dioxins exist in environmental and biological samples as complex mixtures whose relative concentrations differ across trophic levels. These differences are caused by variousenvironmental fates, solubilities, volatilities, and rates of degradation/metabolism. As a result,these mixtures vary spatially in the environment and can change over time. Transport of dioxins involves volatilization and long-range dispersion, primarily from combustion sources via vapors or associated with particulates. Dioxins strongly partition to soilsand sediments and are generally immobile in soils and sediments due to low vapor pressure, lowaqueous solubility, and strong sorption to particles, particularly organic matter (ATSDR, 1998b).The estimated half-life (time required for half a given concentration to decompose or degrade) of2,3,7,8-tetrachloro dibenzo- p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD) on surface soils ranges from 15 years.Page 7Estimated half-lifes for 2,3,7,8-TCDD in subsurface soils may range from 25 to 100 years (ATSDR, 1998b). Much of their presence in plants is due to atmospheric transport on particles,resulting in settling on the leafy tissues of plants (Birnbaum, 1994; EPA, 1994). The primarroute of human exposure to dioxins is through consumption of fatty foods of animal origin suchas meat, fish, and dairy products (Albers et al., 1996, Wild et al., 1994). The effects of 2,3,7,8-TCDD on immune function have been demonstrated to be among the earliest and most sensitive indicators of TCDD-induced toxicity (Burns et al., 1996, p.374).Developmental toxicity has been shown in all laboratory species examined. Where both humanand animal in vivo and in vitro data exist for enzyme induction, chloracne, immunotoxicity, developmental toxicity, and cancers, the sensitivity of humans to 2,3,7,8-TCDD appears similarto experimental animals (Birnbaum, 1994). The International Agency for Research on Cancer has concluded that 2,3,7,8-TCDD is a \"known human carcinogen\" (IARC, 1997). Recent concern about the effects of dioxins on organisms hasincreasingly focused on endocrine disruption (hormonal disruption) and reproductive impairment(EPA, 1997). Scientific Uncertainty: Although dioxin toxicity has been studied intensively, a considerable amount of scientific uncertainty remains with respect to the human relevance of adverse effectsobserved in animal models. Because epidemiological studies are never definitive and thesensitivity of animals differs among species, dioxin risk to humans continues to be debated. Thisuncertainty, and associated controversy surrounding dioxin toxicity, are highlighted in a reviewof the EPA 1994 dioxin reassessment (EPA, 1994), performed by their Scientific Advisory Board(SAB, 1995). What Are Dioxin TEFs and TEQs? Dioxins usually occur in complex mixtures. Of the 210 forms or congeners of polychlorinateddibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans, 17 of these are considered toxic. Congeners are identified by the number and location of chlorine atoms on the molecule. Themost toxic of these congeners have chlorine atoms at four specific sites (the 2,3,7, and 8positions). In this report, the terms \"dioxin\" and \"dioxins\" refer to polychlorinated dibenzo- p- dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans with chlorine atoms in the 2,3,7,8, positions of themolecule. See Figure 1 for the generalized chemical structure and numbering of dioxin. The congener 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro dibenzo- p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD) is assigned a TEF of 1, and the others are assigned values less than 1 (EPA, 1989; Birnbaum, 1994). Toxic equivalents(TEQs) 3 are used to express the total toxicity of dioxin congeners when the concentration of each congener is multiplied by its TEF and all of these products are summed. An example of this calculation is shown in the footnote below. See Appendix 1 for further information. The 3 The calculation of TEQ for an environmental sample containing 5 pptr 2,3,7,8-TCDD and 23 pptr 2,3,7,8 -TCDF (considered 1/10 as TCDD, a TEF of is: [5+(0.1 8O O1 4 69 72 3Polychlorinated structure of dioxins/furans. Numbering system for chlorine atoms is indicated by the first figure. The second figure shows the structures of 2,3,7,8-TCDDand 2,3,7,8-TCDF. Toxicity Equivalency Factor (TEF) concept is based on evidence that dioxin-like compounds share a common mechanism of action (Van den Berg et al., 1998). The basic assumption in thisapproach is that the combined effects of the different congeners are dose or concentrationadditive; the results of many studies support this assumption (Van den Berg et al., 1998). This report uses the international convention TEFs adopted by EPA (1989). Recently, however, new internationally agreed TEFs were established by the World Health Organization (WHO)European Centre for Environment and Health and the International Programme on ChemicalSafety (IPCS). Three sets of TEFs were derived to address humans and mammals, fish, and birds(Van den Berg et al., 1998).Page 91. Metals and Dioxins in Fertilizer Products Purpose The objective of this study was to quantify metals and dioxins in bulk agricultural fertilizers, home-use fertilizers, micronutrients, and soil amendments. In this report, the term \"fertilizer products\" refers to all four of the above substances.Ecology randomly sampled fertilizer products to determine their dioxin concentrations. As part of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) grant, the samples were also analyzed todetermine heavy metal concentrations. Metals analyses of fertilizer products included total metalconcentrations and leaching metal concentrations (using the Toxicity Characteristic LeachingProcedure or TCLP). Results from this study will help assess the effectiveness of Ecology'sscreening criteria for waste-derived fertilizers and micronutrients. As recommended in the preliminary report (Rogowski et al., 1998), a review of information about dioxins in biosolids, and an assessment of annual increases in soil dioxin TEQ levels fromselected fertilizer products and biosolids data, have been added to this chapter of this final report. Study Design To determine which products to sample, random selections were drawn from among productsregistered for use in Washington State in three fertilizer groups: bulk/packaged agriculturalfertilizers, agricultural products with micronutrients, and home-use fertilizer products. Home-use fertilizer products were randomized using a random number generator, and the first 31products were selected. Bulk/packaged agricultural fertilizers were categorized by constituenttype, randomized, and the first few products per category were selected. Micronutrients wereselected at random. Available fertilizer products were substituted for those that could not beobtained randomly. In all, 10 of 60 manufacturers of bulk fertilizers were selected, 12 of 44manufacturers of micronutrients were selected, and 31 of 2296 home use products were selected. Fertilizers are substances containing nitrogen, phosphorus, potash, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, or any of the micronutrients (boron, chlorine, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum,sodium, and zinc). A non-nutritive soil amendment, Ponderay SC, was alsosampled. Because the number of home-use products is considerably greater than the number of agricultural products, the greatest number of samples were of home-use fertilizers. This study focused onzinc as an agricultural micronutrient, because zinc micronutrients were associated with relativel high levels of dioxin and metals in some products previously tested by Ecology in 1997(Golding, 1997; Bowhay et al., 1997). Agricultural products were sampled at distributors ofagricultural chemicals. Home-use fertilizer products were obtained in the form sold to consumersPage 10(i.e., \"off-the-shelf\"). Not all home-use fertilizers registered in Washington State are sold in the state, and some selected home-use fertilizer samples could not be obtained. In these cases, acommonly found product with similar constituents and usage was substituted. A list offertilizers, soil amendments, and micronutrients sampled appears in Appendix 1-A. Fifty-eight samples (50 different products) were analyzed for eight heavy metals and dioxins. This number included two samples each of Cozinco zinc micronutrient and Frit F-503G obtainedindependently from different suppliers, as well as six duplicate samples of other fertilizerproducts. Duplicates are samples taken from a single mixed sample in order to determinereplicability of results. Fort James NutriLime was sampled twice: once in 1997 and once in thisstudy. Sampling Procedures Samples were collected based on procedures described in the Washington State Department ofAgriculture Investigator's Manual , Pesticide Management Division (WSDA, 1991). The following is a description of the modified sampling procedure. Samples were taken using organic-free, laboratory-cleaned sample jars and pre-cleaned stainless steel ladles. Bulk solid samples were collected as grab-composite samples consisting of ten grabsubsamples from discrete parts of a product being sampled. Packaged solid samples wereobtained as grab samples by filling a mixing bowl approximately two-thirds full. Packagedsolids were not composite sampled because of practical constraints in sampling from a container.The subsamples and grab samples were combined in a cleaned, four-quart stainless steel mixingbowl, mixed with the sampling ladle, and split into Ecology and facility sample containers.Sample jars were ultra-clean with Teflon lids. Bulk liquid was sampled by flushing a sampleport and collecting the sample as a grab sample directly into a clean glass sample bottle. Bulkliquids were not composite sampled because of the limitations of sampling from a tap. Thecleaning regimen is listed in Appendix 1-B. Because of the special cleaning requirements for thesampling of dioxins, cleaned stainless steel ladles were used in lieu of the triers (metal tubes)specified in the Washington State Department of Agriculture Investigator's Manual. Sample jars were labeled with tags and placed in plastic bags. All samples were stored in a cooler and maintained at a temperature of 4 \u00b0C until analysis. Chain-of-custody procedures followed the Manchester Environmental Laborator Lab Users Manual (Ecology, 1994a). The samples for this project were delivered to the Manchester Laboratory by Ecology staff. Analytical Procedures Analysis of total metals was carried out by either graphite furnace atomic absorption (GFAA) orinductively coupled plasma (ICP) optical emission spectroscopy, depending on analyte level andmatrix interference. EPA SW-846 Method 6010 was used ICP. and7060 (arsenic) were used. Mercury analysis was carried out by cold vapor atomic absorbance,SW-846 Method 7471. Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) analyses werePage 11carried out in accordance with SW-846 Method 1311. Method references appear inAppendix 1-C. Detection limits for total metals are shown for non-detected total metals results in Appendix 1-G, and for non-detected T CLP results in Table 1-3. Analysis of the 2,3,7,8-substituted dioxin congeners was conducted at MAXIM Te chnologies Inc./Pace Ana lytical, using high resolution GC/MS EPA Method 8290, with enhancements derived from Method 1613B.Detection limits for dioxins varied dependin g upon the physical and chemical characteristics of the samples, with a target detection limit of 0.1 pptr (parts per trillion). EPA Method 8290,Section 7.9.5 specifies the sample specific Estimated De tection Limit (EDL) as the concentration of a given anal yte required to produce a signal with a peak height of at least 2.5 times the background signal level. Not all th e analyses for congeners were responsive enough to provide EDLs down to 0.1 pptr. Data Quality Established laborator y quality control procedures were adequate to estimate laborator y precision and accuracy for this proj ect. Laborator y quality control tests were done on each set of 20 or fewer samples and consisted of blanks, duplicate samples, and spiked sample s. Laborat or quality control and procedures are discussed in the Manchester Environme ntal Laborator Lab Users Manual (Ecology, 1994a). The variabilit y of metals and dioxins in fertilizer products was not addressed for most of the products tested in this study, because onl y one sample was a nalyzed for most produc ts. Limited data for multiple and duplicate samples indicate that v ariability is considerable in some cases. Metals Metals results can be used without qualific ation, except in those cases with low spike recoveries and poor duplicate precision. Qualifiers appear in the data tables included in this report. Adiscussion of Qua lity Assurance /Quality Control (QA/QC) for metals appears in Appendix 1-D. A comparison of multiple sample metals results, as well as duplicate sample results, appears inAppendix 1-E. Duplicate sample results were in close agreement. The target relative percentdifference (RPD) was 25% or lower. The average (RPD) for pairs of detected metals was 23%,within the target range; and the range of RPDs was not ex cessive, indicating moderate consistenc y in sampling and ana lysis. RPD, a measure of precision, is the ratio of the difference and the mean of the results expressed as a percentage. A low RPD indicates high precision. Dioxin Quality Assurance/Qu ality Control (QA/QC) measure s indicate that the dioxin results are accurate. One sample (328132) exceeded the allowable 30-day holding perio d by one day, butPage 12holding time is not considered critical for dioxin. Calibration standards, internal standard recoveries, ion abundance ratios, and matrix spike/matrix spike duplicates were acceptable. Amore complete discussion of QA/QC appears in Appendix 1-D. In the fall of 1997, when Ecology sampled several waste-derived fertilizer products, dolomite was sampled to serve as a blank sample. No 2,3,7,8-substituted dioxins congeners were detectedin the dolomite sample, yielding a dioxin TEQ of 0 for the case where undetected congeners areassumed to have a dioxin concentration of 0 (minimum value). The TEQ (toxic equivalent) was0.84 pptr for the \"worst case\" (maximum value) where the calculation of TEQ is made, assumingall undetected congeners were present at the detect limit (i.e., non-detects set to the detectionlimit [ND=DL] - Golding, 1997). See Appendix 1 for a discussion of dioxin TEQ calculations.Of the 50 fertilizer products sampled in this study, no dioxins were detected in 13 of the fertilizerproducts. These results indicate that the sampling and analysis techniques employed werecapable of measuring small concentrations of dioxin without significant field or la borator contamination. Field quality assurance for this project consisted of six duplicate split samples. The differences in duplicate sample results reflect combined sampling and laboratory variability. All duplicatesample RPD between theduplicate split sample results was not calculated, because RPDs are not meaningful when resultsapproach zero. Because the dioxin TEQs of duplicated samples were low, conclusions cannot bedrawn concerning the replicability of samples with larger TEQs. Results and Discussion Total Metals Metals analyses results are shown in Appendix 1-G. Each value represents the result of a singlecomposite or grab sample of a product. Table 1-1 shows the dry fertilizer products with the five highest total metal concentrations for each metal tested and the products' metal concentrations. None of the ten liquid fertilizers testedwas among the five highest metals, but liquid fertilizers were reported in terms of wet weight andare not comparable with dry weight results. From Table 1-1, the fertilizer products with the highest concentrations of metals were NuLife All-Purpose Trace Elements (75.2 (657,000 mg/kg-dw zinc).Page 13Table 1-1.

Zinc is intentionally added as a micronutrient in some fertilizer products. Thefertilizer products sampled were in the channels of trade prior to the 1998 registration. As aresult, some of these products may no longer be available or may have been reformulated . The source of the metals in Frit 503-G is industrial by-products (Schauble, 1998). NuLife All-Purpose Trace Elements contains Frit 503-G as its primary ingredient. The source of thecadmium in Agrium Ammonium Phosphate Sulfate is naturally occurring cadmium in westernrock phosphate. The source of chromium in McLendon Weed and Feed appears to be chromiumsulfate from leather tanning by-products. Table 1-2 compares the estimated annual loading of metals for five fertilizer products with the highest total metal concentrations for arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury to the Washingtonstandards (Washington State Legislature, 1998). From Table 1-2, Fort James NutriLime exceeds the standard for arsenic, Pace NuLife 10-20-20 and Webfoot Rhododendron exceed the standard for cadmium, and Sample 1 of Gaia's Owncotton seed meal exceeds the standard for lead. The Washington standards adopted in RCW15.54.820 are the maximum annual metal additions to soil allowed in Washington. Theapplication rates in this study are not necessarily those used by the Washington State Departmentof Agriculture to regulate heavy metals in fertilizers.Page 15Table 1-2.

A number of products registered priorto passage of the Fertilizer Regulation Act, which includes the Washington Standards for Metals,will not be re-registered for the 1999 registration cycle. The standards are shown in Appendix 1-H. To date, the state departments of Agriculture and Ecology are aware of 139 fertilizer productsfrom 45 manufacturers that have been voluntarily withdrawn from consideration for the 1999registration cycle. It is unclear what is causing companies not to re-register their products (i.e.,standards, labeling requirements, or regulatory requirements). Two of the five fertilizer products with the highest cadmium concentrations are phosphate fertilizers: Agrium ammonium phosphate sulfate and UAP 0-45-0. As noted in the 1997screening survey (Bowha et al., 1997), phosphate fertilizers had relatively high amounts ofproduct applied per acre (loading rates). More phosphate fertilizer is applied in the state thanmicronutrient fertilizer. Cadmium was found to be elevated in agricultural soils in the Metals inSoils study (Chapter 2). The study found a small but significant increase in cadmium in theagricultural soils sampled, as opposed to background non-agricultural soil samples. TCLP Metals Sources of metals in fertilizer products include natural elements found in raw materials, andimpurities in wastes or industrial by-products from manufacturing. Beginning July 1, 1999,waste-derived and micronutrient fertilizers must undergo an evaluation required by law(RCW 15.54.820) to determine if those products meet solid waste and dangerous wasteregulations. A primary dangerous waste regulation is that metal concentrations are limited in fertilizer products derived from dangerous waste. These limits, known as Land Disposal Restrictions (LDR), vary according to the type of dangerous waste used to make the fertilizer products butgenerally are equal to the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) limits listed inAppendix 1-I. The TCLP limits are also used to determine if a waste is subject to regulation as adangerous waste. Generally, the TCLP is the test method used to evaluate the metalconcentrations for both the LDR and dangerous waste designation. Ecology intends to use the TCLP limits as a screening criterion in the fertilizer evaluation process. An effective screening criterion would differentiate between dangerous-waste-derivedfertilizers (those in compliance with LDR standards) that pass fertilizer review criteria anddangerous-waste-derived fertilizers (those out of compliance with LDR standards) that fail theEcology fertilizer review criteria. (See Appendix 1-J for a description of criteria used inEcology's fertilizer review process.) If TCLP limits are exceeded, the manufacturer must submitinformation about whether dangerous wastes were used in manufacturing the fertilizer products.This information is then used to determine which LDR standards apply and whether the fertilizermeets the standards.Page 17A high total metals level for a fertilizer product indicates (1) an increased likelihood that the fertilizer will exceed TCLP limits and (2) that the fertilizer may be a waste-derived product. Inthis study Ecology conducted TCLP testing on 16 fertilizer products with relatively high totalmetal concentrations 4. The testing helped assess the effectiveness of this waste-derived and micronutrient fertilizer screening criterion, by determining if waste-derived fertilizers would failthe TCLP screening criterion and be subject to review for compliance with LDR standards.Furthermore, the testing helped determine whether waste-derived fertilizers that failed the TCLPalso failed appropriate LDR standards. In accordance with guidance provided by the EPA RCRA Hotline 5, all samples for which total metal concentrations equaled or exceeded 20 times the dangerous waste limit for a TCLP metal(WAC 173-303-090) were tested using the TCLP analysis Method 1311. The 20 times rule does not apply to liquid samples. The liquid sample serves as the leaching extract directly, and thetotal metals of the liquid sample are compared with the TCLP limits. The results of these testsare shown in Table 1-3. Fertilizers not exceeding the 20 times rule for a particular metal were not tested, and there is a corresponding blank place in Table 1-3. Appendix 1-I shows the TCLPlimits and 20 times these limits. Appendix I-J describes the Ecology fertilizer review process. Seven of the 16 products tested in 1998 exceeded TCLP limits for cadmium (Table 1-4). These products were (1) Agrium Ammonium Phosphate Sulfate, (2) United Agri Products 0-45-0,(3) Frit 10-15-10, and (7) Thrifty Payless Tomato and Vegetable Food. Two of theseven were bulk or packaged agricultural phosphate fertilizers, one was an agriculturalmicronutrient, and four were home-use packaged fertilizer products. Ecology contacted the companies that manufacture these products to determine if any of these products are waste-derived. Only two products are thought by the manufacturers to be waste-derived. Frit F-503G was made from a hazardous waste, steel mill flue dust, prior to 1988 andmanufactured from a non-hazardous waste after 1988 (Schauble 1998). It is not known when thesampled Frit product was manufactured. NuLife All-Purpose Trace Elements has Frit F-503G asa principal ingredient (Shaffer, 1998). Two containers of Frit F-503G were sampled and onl one sample exceeded the TCLP limits. The NuLife All-Purpose Trace Elements sample did notfail the TCLP test. From these results one might conclude that the TCLP test is not completely effective as a screening criterion since the NuLife All-Purpose Trace Elements product would not have beensubject to further review. However, NuLife All-Purpose Trace Elements is in compliance withLDR regulations; therefore, the TCLP screening criterion appears to accurately predict 4 The fertilizer products tested for TCLP metals were chosen based on their total metal concentrations and not because they were determined to be waste-derived fertilizers. Some or all of these products may have elevated metal concentrations due to naturally occurring metals in raw materials. 5 Elsevier Science Inc. 1996.

This suggests the 20 times rule can also be an effective screening criterion. Either the TCLP test or the total metals test may bean effective screening criterion for products that warrant further examination by Ecology due tohigh metal levels. Comparison of Metals Results with the Findings of Previous Ecology Sampling Events Three of the 50 fertilizer products sampled in July-August 1998 for this study were pr eviousl sampled in January 1998: Kelly Green Fresh Fish Fertilizer, Cozinco, and QC 30% Zinc.Although these products have elevated levels of cadmium, chromium, and lead, they do notexceed the TCLP limit by 20 times, so no TCLP testing was warranted. Results between both 6 In actuality, neither NuLife All-Purpose Trace Elements nor FRIT F-503G are subject to the LDR requirements because there is a federal exemption for steel mill flue dust that is used to manufacture fertilizer.Page 19Table 1-4.

This is an indication thatproducts differed in composition between the two sampling dates. Appendix 1-K shows acomparison between the metals results. Appendix 1-L shows the January 1998 results.Appendix 1-M lists the materials or product names and manufacturers of the products shown inAppendix 1-L. Metals results obtained in a 1997 sampling survey of several waste-derived fertilizer product sources are shown in Appendix 1-N. Four of the products sampled in the fall of 1997(Golding, 1997) were also sampled earlier in 1997 (Bowha et al., 1997). In the Bowhay study, aHolnam cement kiln dust soil amendment sample was found to have 150 mg/kg-dw of total lead.In the fall 1997 study, Holnam cement kiln dust had 230 mg/kg-dw of total lead. TCLP tests ofHolnam cement kiln dust have shown no exceedance of TCLP limits (Stone, 1998). Bay Zinc Company, Inc. has produced several zinc micronutrient products from several sources of zinc-containing material. A comparison of metals results shows that Bay Zinc 18% Blu-Minmicronutrient samples obtained for the 1997 metals screening study, as well as the 1997 dioxinand metals study, had close results, with an average RPD for paired detected metals of 9%.Bay Zinc 18% Blu-Min was derived from K061 steel mill flue dust. \"K061\" is a RCRA wastecode for dangerous waste designation. When K061 is recycled into zinc micronutrient fertilizerit is currently exempt from dangerous waste regulations (WAC 173-303-071).Page 20Dioxin A few fertilizer products were found to contain relatively high levels of dioxin. Two fertilizer products had dioxin TEQs of greater than 50 pptr. of 27 pptr. The Frit a micronutrient believed to be derived from steelmill flue dust (Bowhay, 1998). NuLife All-Purpose Trace Elements had a dioxin TEQ of 54pptr. All other fertilizer products had TEQs of less than 10 pptr. The Cozinco micronutrientproduct and other zinc micronutrient products had low TEQs compared with the Frit sampleresults. The Cozinco product is derived from galvanizing waste (Bowhay, 1998). The results of analyses for two independently collected samples of the Cozinco 35.50% zinc micronutrient from different suppliers were close, with TEQs within 0.1 pptr. (Appendix 1-F).This shows good agreement between the two samples and their analyses. The results for the twoindependently collected Frit F-503G samples differed by a factor of 5. Metals results for thesetwo samples also varied considerably, indicating that the product as sampled was not consistentwith respect to the metals tested (Appendix 1-E). Figures 1-1 and 1-2 show dioxin product samples, rank-ordered by TEQ. Figure 1-3 shows a frequency distribution of TEQs for dioxin results of the fertilizer productstested. Figure 1-3 and Appendix 1-O show that 36 of the 50 products sampled (72%) had TEQsof less than 0.1 pptr. (There are 37 total samples with TEQs of less than 0.1 pptr, but two ofthese are multiple samples of Cozinco micronutrient product). Fertilizer products with lowTEQs tend to have many non-detected congeners, and for this reason, their calculated T EQs ma range widely depending on the method of TEQ calculation, as seen in supplemental appendix 1-N. A summary of dioxin TEQs for fertilizers sampled in 1998 appears in Appendix 1-O, and TEQ calculations are found in Appendices 1-P and 1-Q. When a compound being analyzed is notdetected, the result is termed a \"non-detect\" and the true sample concentration of that compoundis not known, falling somewhere between zero and the detection limit (DL) of the analysis. Inthis study, unless otherwise noted, TEQs are calculated based on non-detects set to 0 (ND=0), sothat calculated TEQs are minimum TEQs. The three methods of calculating the TEQs that appear in Appendix 1-O are explained in Appendix 1. Each value represents the results of asingle grab or composite sample of a product. See Appendix 1-R for a summary of results forfertilizer products and micronutrients sampled in 1997 (Golding, 1997). In 1997, seven waste-derived fertilizer products were tested for dioxin. One of these products, 18% Blu-Min micronutrient, Appendix 1-R). Theproduct was marketed by Bay Zinc Company, Inc. and was derived from steel mill flue dust.Fort James NutriLime was tested in 1997 and again in 1998. NutriLime is fly ash from a Fort James hog fuel boiler. The dioxin TEQ for the Fort James NutriLime sampled in October 1997 (35 pptr) was greater than the TEQ for the August 1998 sample (7.4 pptr) by almost a factor of 5.This may be the result of differences in hog fuel boiler fuel or operating conditions (Young,1998).Figure1-1.

The products tested in 1997, with the exception of dolomite, were selected because they were waste-derived productsassociated with known or reported sources of dioxin, whereas most products tested in 1998 wererandomly selected from all registered fertilizers. In order to give perspective to the dioxin data, following is a comparison of dioxin results with guidelines and findings of other studies, and dioxins in biosolids. A comparison of estimatedincreases in soil concentrations of dioxins from the application of selected fertilizer product isalso included. Comparison of Dioxin Results with Guidelines and the Findings of Other Studies A literature review found no studies of dioxin levels in fertilizers. While no applicable standards for dioxins in fertilizers were found at this time, Germany has adopted guidelines for dioxins insoil (Schulz, 1993). The German guidelines state that fruits, legumes, and forage plants must notbe cultivated when the dioxin TEQ of soils is greater than 40 pptr. Fertilizer dioxin levels can be compared with the results of the Dioxins in Soils study (Chapter 3). Most fertilizer products tested in 1998 had low dioxin levels, with 72% of the productssampled having dioxin TEQs of less than 0.1 pptr. The Dioxin in Soils study found only 17% ofsoil samples in Washington State with a dioxin TEQ of less than 0.1pptr. The reason for thehigher soil levels of dioxin may be that soil is more subject to atmospheric deposition of dioxinthan are fertilizers. (Czuczwa et al., 1984; Czuczwa and Hites, 1986; Creaser et al., 1989;Rotard et al., 1994). Dioxins in Biosolids Fertilizer products are not the only nutritive materials applied to agricultural lands with the potential for containing dioxins. Compost, farmyard manures, and biosolids may contain dioxins(Duarte-Davidson et al., 1997). Municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) generate largequantities of sewage sludge, which when properly treated is known as biosolids. Biosolids are avaluable soil amendment due to their organic material and nutrient content, and their beneficialuse is seen as an environmentally sound alternative to disposal. However, some contaminantspresent in municipal wastewater can accumulate in biosolids (McLachlan et al., 1996). EPA hasadopted standards for several pollutants in biosolids in 40 CFR Part 503, and the state hasequivalent requirements in Chapter 173-308 WAC. There are currently no federal or WashingtonState standards for dioxins in biosolids. Dioxins are among the compounds that have been found to accumulate in biosolids after passing through municipal WWTPs. Volatilization and photodegradation have a negligible influence onthe fate of dioxins in biosolids applied to soil (McLachlan et al., 1996).Page 25Sources of Dioxins in Biosolids Dioxins have been measured in nearly all biosolids tested, although the concentra tions var widely (EPA, 1988). EPA (1998) cites the work of McLachlan, Horstmann, and Hinkel (1996),who have investigated potential sources of dioxins to WWTPs in Germany. While usually anegligible source, industrial wastewater contributions can sometimes be an important source ofdioxins to municipal WWTPs and the biosolids they produce. While pulp and paper mills ma be potential sources of dioxins, they generally treat their wastewater on site for discharge and donot typically contribute industrial wastewater to municipal WWTPs. Surface runoff enteringWWTPs through combined sewers, and by inflow and infiltration, also contribute dioxins inbiosolids. The washing of dioxin contaminated clothing has been found in one study to be a principal source of dioxins in biosolids (McLachlan et al., 1996). The pattern of dioxins in some newtextiles was found to have the signature of dioxins associated with pentachlophenol (PCP), withcertain dyestuffs making a lesser contribution (McLachlan et al., 1996). Using several data sets,including summary results of the EPA Sewage Sludge Survey, the multivariate principalcomponent analysis in Chapter 3 of this report demonstrated an association between biosolidsand PCP in terms of dioxin congener patterns (Figure 3-5, Figure 3-6). However, the magnitudeand variation of the contribution of dioxin in biosolids remains to be established in WashingtonState and nationwide. Typical Concentrations of Dioxins in Biosolids Jones and Sewart (1997) have reviewed concentrations of dioxins found in biosolids from data collected worldwide. The range of dioxin TEQ values for biosolids reported in the worldwideliterature is 0.5 to 4,100 pptr. Biosolids with particularly high TEQs are likely associated withindustrial wastewater contributors having high concentrations of dioxins. The mean dioxin TEQfor biosolids from nine studies conducted in Europe ranged from 23.3 pptr to 357 pptr. Themedian dioxin TEQ from these studies ranged from 21 to 90 pptr. For the 239 samples obtainedduring the EPA Sewage Sludge Survey (1988), the mean dioxin TEQ was found to be 83 pptr.The median dioxin TEQ, a better indicator of typical concentrations, was found to be 37 pptr.These TEQ calculations were made based on non-detected congeners being represented by valuesset at one-half of the detection limit. The calculations were based on data derived in part fromanalyses that had relatively higher limits of detection. If more current data for biosolids can becollected, detection limits may decline because of improved analytical capabilities, likellowering calculated dioxin TEQs. Dioxin levels in fertilizer products sampled in this study can be compared with biosolids dioxin levels by using the same dioxin TEQ calculation method as was used in the EPA Sewage SludgeSurvey (with non-detected congeners set at one-half of the detection limit). The mean dioxinTEQ for fertilizer products calculated on this basis is 5.4 pptr, and the median is 1.2 pptr.Comparisons between the different data sets are approximate.Page 26Washington State Biosolids Dioxins Data One of the 239 sample results reported by the EPA in the 1988 National Sewage Sludge Surve was from a sample collected at the METRO Renton WWTP (Renton). The Ren ton facilit serves a major portion of the King County metropolitan area. Approximately 60 industrial userscollectively discharge more than 2.5 MGD of wastewater to the facility, approximately fourpercent of the dry weather flow (Ecology, 1997). With non-detected congeners set at aconcentration of zero was 9.5 pptr. With non-detected congeners set ata concentration of one-half the detection limit (ND=1/2 DL), the dioxin TEQ was 42 pptr. Thedetection limits for the data were considerably higher than the detection limits of this fertilizerscreening study. As a result, the Renton reported TEQ tends to be inflated when compared to thefertilizer results on the basis of one-half detection limit. METRO has provided Ecology with theresults of a second sample of biosolids from the Renton facility, collected in 1997. Detectionlimits were lower in the more recent data. For ND=0, the dioxin TEQ was 14 pptr. ForND=1/2DL, the dioxin TEQ was 23 pptr. Other than the results from the METRO Renton WWTP, no dioxin data for biosolids in Washington State were available at the time this report was prepared. Ecology believes it is goodpolicy for operators to obtain information on dioxins in their biosolids, in view of potentialfederal regulations that may be proposed later this year. Currently there is no requirement foroperators to provide this information. Ecology has expressed an interest in obtaining additionaldata on dioxins in biosolids with the cooperation of the Northwest Biosolids ManagementAssociation. The Association has indicated a willingness to work with Ecology on this subjectand has assigned a committee to that task. Biosolids Data Needs The national data collected by EPA in 1988 may not represent conditions in Washington State today, and Ecology needs to obtain data on dioxins concentrations in biosolids representative ofWashington State. The EPA 1988 Sewage Sludge Survey can serve as a model of the approachto be taken. Comparison of Estimated Increases in Soil Concentrations of Dioxins The concentrations of dioxins in soils from the application of fertilizer products can be estimated.Expected increases in the concentrations of dioxins in soils with the application of fertilizerproducts containing dioxins depends upon the application rates of the products. Micronutrientshave lower application rates than other fertilizer products, as reflected in Table 1-5. Theestimated annual increase in soil dioxin TEQ level in the table below is calculated using a simplesoils mixing equation: Annual increase in soil TEQ level (pptr) = (annual application rate inkg/ha) X (TEQ) X (5 X 10 -7 ha/kg). The equation assumes uniform mixing of fertilizer products containing dioxins to a uniform depth and no degradation of dioxins over time.Page 27Table 1-5. Estimated increase in soil concentration of dioxins from selected agricultural fertilizer products.

The estimated annual increases in soil TEQ levels for the fertilizer products in Table 1-5 ranged from 0.0001 pptr to 0.99 pptr. While dioxin TEQ levels for the Bay Zinc and Frit micronutrientswere the highest tested, they contribute relatively low estimated increases in soils dioxin levels.Estimated soils dioxin TEQ increases associated with those products are less than one-twentiethof the estimated increases from the Fort James NutriLime samples and biosolids. Conclusions Cadmium was found in relatively high concentrations in two phosphate fertilizers tested.Cadmium was also elevated in agricultural soils as compared with background soils in theMetals in Soils Study (Chapter 2). The TCLP metals limits appear to be an adequate screening criterion for predicting whether fertilizers are in compliance with the current LDR standards. If the LDR standards are loweredas a result of ongoing state and federal rulemaking efforts, the TCLP screen will be less effective.It will then be important to consider using the 20 times rule as a screening criterion. The alternative screen will ensure that fertilizers with a lower range of total metals content will bereviewed against the lower LDR standards.Page 28Seventy-two percent of the 50 fertilizer products tested in this 1998 study had dioxin TEQs of less than 0.1 pptr. Most of the fertilizers sampled had lower dioxin TEQs than did the soilssurveyed (Chapter 3). Two of the fertilizer products sampled in 1998 and two of the fertilizerproducts sampled in 1997 had dioxin TEQs higher than any of the TEQs found in the soils dioxinstudy. However, the dioxin level in soils after fertilizer products are applied is dependent onapplication rate. The four products with high TEQs are micronutrients that are applied to soils atvery low rates, and calculations of soil concentrations after mixing found that they add a minimalamount of dioxins to soil. A literature review found no studies of dioxin levels in fertilizers.There are no applicable standards for dioxin in fertilizers at this time. While dioxin TEQ levels for the Bay Zinc and Frit micronutrients were the highest tes ted, the contribute relatively low estimated increases in soils TEQ levels. Estimated soils dioxin TEQincreases associated with those products are less than one-twentieth of the estimated increasesfrom the Fort James NutriLime samples and biosolids. Of the fertilizer products sampled in 1998, fertilizer products having dioxin TEQs greater than 50 pptr were Frit F-503G mean value) and NuLife All-Purpose Trace Elements (54pptr). By comparison, of all waste-derived fertilizer products and micronutrients sampled in1997, the of340 pptr. The Fort James NutriLime sample in 1997 was found to have a dioxin TEQ of 35 pptr. Available nationwide data on dioxin levels in biosolids are limited to data collected over ten years ago in the EPA Sewage Sludge Survey, and there is little data for Washington State.Review of statewide biosolids data and additional sampling are needed. A multivariate analysis using principal component analyses is consistent with the literature that indicates pentachlorophenol may be a source of dioxin in municipal biosolids.Page 292. Metals in Soils Purpose The objective of the metals in soils study was to determine if certain metals have accumulated in agricultural soils of the Columbia Basin of Washington State. Ecology randomly sampled and analyzed seven metal concentrations in agricultural and non- agricultural (background) soils from the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project and compared theresults with three other soil studies. Agricultural lands are defined as lands in active agriculturalproduction. Non-agricultural lands are lands that have never been farmed, tilled, or grazed. Sampling Procedures The Columbia Basin Irrigation Project was selected for soil sampling because of the agriculturaldiversity and potential availability of historical information. The study area included portions ofAdams, Franklin, and Grant counties within the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project. An importantaspect of this study area is that historical agricultural practices (e.g., cropping patterns andagricultural chemical use) can be documented. Fields with historical use of biosolids (sewage sludge) and/or lead arsenate pesticides were excluded from this study, and sampling was limited to irrigated agricultural fields. Backgroundsites were non-irrigated, non-agricultural areas. Twenty agricultural sites and 13 matchedbackground non-agricultural sites were sampled. Site History Within the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project in central Washington State, Grant County was theprimary sampling location (Figure 2-1). One sample was taken from Adams County, and nosamples were taken from Franklin County. Grant C ounty covers approximately 691,175 hectares (1,707,870 acres). The Columbia River flows in a deep valley along the southwestern boundar of the county. The southern portion of the county contains Saddle Mountains and FrenchmanHills. Babcock Ridge and Beezly Hills border the northern part of the plain (Gentry, 1984). Grant County has approximatel 62 types of soil with a wide range of texture and natural drainage (Gentry, 1984). Wind and water erosion are major soil-related problems in the southernpart of the county. Agriculture is the main economic enterprise in the county. About 19 percentof the total area is irrigated cropland, about 18 percent is non-irrigated cropland, and about62 percent is rangeland. Rangeland includes natural grasslands, savannas, wetlands, deserts, andareas that support certain forb and shrub communities (Gentry, 1984). Only 971 hectaresPage 30 Figure 2-1. Map showing location of Grant County in Washington State. (2,400 acres or 0.1% of the c ounty) are classif ied as urban. The county's main irrigated crops are winter wheat, alfalfa hay, potatoes, corn, and beans (Gentry, 1984). The main non-irrigated cropis winter wheat. Landowners of the 20 agricultural fields sampled were surveyed about the history of each field. Each owner was asked: 1. The year the field was originally cultivated, and 2. If row crops, hay, small grains, pasture, orchard, or other crop had ever been grown on the field and, if so, for how many years. Historical site information is summarized in Appendix 2-A1. When sampled, the crops present were alfalfa, apples, beans, corn, pasture, potato, primrose, sugar beet, and wheat (Table 2-1).Compared with the USDA Soil Survey (Gentry, 1984), the crop types encountered arerepresentative of the area. The majority of these fields had been cultivated with combinations of row crops, hay, and small grains. Two fields had previously been pasture, and two other fields had previously been fruitorchard. Three fields had been cultivated at one time with asparagus, seed, and peppermint.Initial cultivation of most fields began when the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project began in thePage 31Table 2-1. Crops present on fields sampled.

Two fields had been dry land farmed before the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project began. The historical diversity of the crops on the fields sampled indicate that a variety offarming practices have been used over the past 40 to 50 years. Because of this diversity, a widerange of fertilizer types has likely been applied to these soils. Site Selection The Columbia Basin Irrigation Project is divided into uniquely numbered farm units. Each farmunit represents one or more fields owned by an individual. Computer-generated numbers and arandom number table (Steel and Torrie, 1960) were used to create a list of potential farm unitnumbers representing the unique identification numbers associated with the farm units. Ecolog verified that these numbers corresponded to farm fields using farm unit maps (USDI, 1982). Landowners were contacted and asked to participate in the study. Before owners were contacted, fields were roughly compared to selection criteria and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)soil survey maps (Gentry, 1984). Selection criteria for agricultural field sampling followedHolmgren site selection criteria (Holmgren et al., 1993). See Appendix 2-A2 for selectioncriteria. If a farm unit did not meet the selection criteria, it was eliminated from the list of potential sampling locations before contact with the owner. When owners were contacted, selectioncriteria were confirmed. Sites not meeting the criteria were excluded from the study beforeparticipation was requested. If available, the historical agricultural use of acceptable sites wasrecorded. See Figure 2-2 for map of generalized sampling areas. From these seven generallocations, twenty agricultural samples and thirteen background samples were taken. Nineteensites were located in Grant County, and one was located in Adams County. No sites meeting thecriteria and landowner approval were found in Franklin County.Page 32 Figure 2-2. Map of general sampling locations (round shaded areas). Participation in the sampling program was voluntary. As owners were asked to participate, their responses were recorded (Appendix 2-B). The predetermined rejection rate to constitute anunacceptable, unquantifiable bias was twenty rejections, prior to obtaining 20 participants. Had20 rejections been obtained, this study would have been terminated. At the time the twentieth landowner agreed to participate, eight had rejected the opportunity. Landowners did not exhibit a bias related to knowledge about metal concentrations in theagricultural soil. Several participants acknowledged some reservation about the sampling,because the heavy metal content of their soil was unknown to them, although they rou tinel tested the soil for nutrient content. Matching Background Sites with Agricultural Fields The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Soil Survey for Grant C ounty (Gentry, 1984) was used to classify soil types for all sites. Table 2-2 summarizes the soil types by sample site. The tablealso lists the percent of that soil type found in Grant County. A brief description of each soil typecan be found in Appendix 2-E. All of the agricultural sites selected had potential background sites in close proximity. However, in several cases, additional background sites were located because access could not be obtainedfor sampling. Some background sites were farther from the agricultural sites than originall planned. As a result, agricultural and background sites were not uniquely paired one to one.Appendix 2-C lists soil types and the distances separating the agricultural sites from thebackground sites. In all cases soil types of the selected agricultural and background sites werePage 33Table 2-2. Soil types of fields sampled in the Columbia Basin. Percent (%) of Grant CountySoil Type and Number of Samples Percent (%) of Total Sample Sites 5% Ephrata-Malaga Ephrata fine sandy loam (3)9% 11% Kennewick-Warden-Sagemoor Kennewick sandy loam (2)Kennewick silt loam (4)Warden silt loam (3)Sagemoor silt loam (2)Novark silt loam Quincy 4% Timmerman-Quincy Timmerman coarse sandy loam (4)Royal very fine sandy loam (2)18% identified using USDA soil maps. Sample sites included 20 agricultural sites and 13 background sites. The background sites were selected based on landowners' site history, as well as visual evidence that the sites had not been cultivated. Ten background sites had sagebrush ( Artemesia sp. ) and cryptobiotic crusts present, suggesting undisturbed soils (Katona et al., 1996). Two sites had1.83 m (6 foot) tall sagebrush specimens and steep topography that suggested no historical cultivation. One site was within an historic railroad right-of-way and had been plowed for weedcontrol by the second-generation landowner but never planted. A more certain background sitecould not be found for this soil type due to its presence in prime farmland. Variability in soilparticle size distribution between and within soil types was noted. See Appendix 2-D for soilparticle size distribution per sample and soil type. Sampling Procedures For each site sampled, large-scale maps of the selected fields were obtained, and 0.4 hectare(one-acre) grid was used with a global positioning system (GPS) to identify the latitude andlongitude of the starting point in each one-acre sampling unit. Five samples were taken within the identified one-acre sampling unit and combined to create one composite sample per sampling unit or field. The starting point was one sample, with the otherfour samples collected in a radius originating from the starting point at a distance ofapproximately 27.4 meters (30 yards) at equal intervals of 90\u00b0.Page 34The surfac e layer of vegetative or organic material was removed and a 30.5-cm (12-inch) deep hole was dug. A depth of 30.5 cm was used to account for local tilling and farmers nutrient-sampling practices. Equal portions of soil were collected with a clean stainless steel trowel,between the surface and a depth of 30.5 cm, from an uncontaminated side of the hole. An equalamount of material was removed from each sample site and combined in a clean stainless steelmixing bowl. Samples were thoroughl y mixed and placed in pre-cleaned sample jars. Sample jars were labeled with an Ecolog y seal, a sample number, date, and the investigator's initials. All samples were stored in a cooler and maintained at a temperature of 4\u00b0C untilanalyses. Chain-of-custod y procedures followed Manchester Environmen tal Labora tor (Ecology, 1994a) guidelines. The samples for this project were delivered to the Manchester Laboratory by Ecology staff. Field qual ity assurance consisted of four \"blind\" replicate samples taken from the same agricultural field. Blind replicate samples are identical samples submitted to t he laborator y with different identification numbers. An estimate of the combined sampling and laborator y precision can be determin ed by calculating the relative percent difference (RPD) between the duplicate sample results. The RPD is the ratio of the difference and the mean of the results expressed as apercentage. Analyses Appendix 2-F summarizes the an alyses and methods used on each sample. Analyses conducted on all samples included pH, soil particle size (or grain a nalysis), total organic carbon (TOC), total phosphorus, and cation exchange c apacity (CEC). In addition to total meta ls analyses (As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Hg, Ni, Zn), an e xtraction procedure and analysis to help determine metal concentrations available to plants was performed (diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid [DTPA] extractable metals, As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn). The intent of the DTPA procedure was to determine the portion of metals present that ma y be available to plant life (Spielman and Shelton, 1989). Data Quality Precision and Acc urac Routine laborator y quality control procedures were adequate to estimate laborator y precision and accuracy for this proj ect. Laborator y quality control tests were done on each set of 20 or fewer samples and consisted of blanks, duplicate samples, and spiked samples.One sample in each set of evaluations was a nalyzed in duplicate in order to assess precision. Precision and acc uracy for all analyses was also assessed throug h the analysis of two matrix spikes and matrix spike duplicates. Method criteria were applied to results to ensure acceptable accuracy and precision.Page 35Representa tiveness Because a comprehensiv e analysis of area soils was not cost-effective at the time of this study, the results are considered a screening surve y of the area and not a characterization of the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project soils. The sample size determination was arbitrary. Comparab ility Samples were anal yzed using standard anal ytical methods (EPA, 1986) at the Manchester Environmental Laboratory and state-accredited laboratories. Samples were a nalyzed for metal concentrations at the 1.0 mg/kg detection level, or lower. Metal an alytes not detected (\"non-detects\") were identified as such in Appendix 2-I. General Chemi stry Quality Assurance The data generated b y the analysis of these samples can be used with the qualifications discussed in Appendix 2-G. Metals Ana lysis Quality Assurance The data generated b y the analysis of these samples can be used noting data qualifications discussed in Appendix 2-H. Data Limitations Field variabi lity (variability within a single field) was not addressed in this study . Only one composite sample per field was tak en. Limitations, part icularly for site matching, in these analyses are due to: differences in soil properties limited resources to look at c ursory soil properties differing irrigation practices small sample size Results and Discussion Results Data SummaryTable 2-3 summarizes the results of the metal an alyses in Columbia Bas in Irrigation Project Agricultural soils.

Statistical Summary The sample collection design for analyzing metals in agricultural soils attempted to provide \"paired\" or matched samples from agricultural fields and non-farmed background fields. Apaired sampling design is beneficial to the degree that it controls for extraneous variability thatPage 37tends to mask the effects of a targeted variable. The pairing of samples needs to control for the extraneous factors that could affect measurements, by making the members of each pair \"equal\"on most traits. To detect an effect without controlling extraneous variability, much larger samplesizes may be required. A paired sampling design allows for a smaller sample size whilemaintaining statistical power to detect effects, or (equivalently) greater power can be achievedfor a fixed number of samples. The ideal method for a paired soil sampling design would be to sample in the same fields before and after application of fertilizer products. That design could not be implemented for thisscreening study. Instead, the pairing of soil samples in this study was based on matching of soiltypes and spatial proximity between paired background and agricultural fields. While many ofthe background samples were adjacent to the agricultural field samples, several were located at aconsiderable distance relative to the overall study area dimensions (Appendix 2-C). It is alsouncertain in some cases whether or not the agricultural field samples and matched backgroundsamples are identical in soil type. These factors raise some concerns about the strength of thepairing in the study as carried out, even though the two data sets (agricultural fields andbackground fields) are far from independent. The study design as carried out probably representsan intermediate condition between independent and a paired sample design. Given the reasonable questions about the strength of pairing between samples, statistical analyses were first performed using an approach with minimal assumptions about the data sets. Allstatistical analyses were conducted using SYSTAT 7.01 (SPSS Inc., 1997). Non-parametric,unpaired statistical tests comparing agricultural field results and background field results werefirst performed using the Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon) rank sum test. This approach assumes thetwo data sets are independent and does not require that data be normally distributed. The non-parametric test is based on the ranks of the measurements in the combined data sets. The nullhypothesis that there is no difference between agricultural and background fields was testedagainst the alternative hypothesis that there is a difference (two-tailed test). The results areprovided in Table 2-4. Statistically significant differences ( p less than 0.05) are shown for total cadmium and zinc and also extractable (DTPA) cadmium and zinc. Cadmium and zinc total metals and DTPA werehigher in agricultural soils than in background soils. Although zinc concentration differedsignificantly between agricultural and background fields (with alpha set at 0.05), the statisticalsignificance is equivocal, since repeated tests were performed, raising the potential for falsepositives (Stevens, 1986). A second set of statistical analysis was performed assuming that the data are paired, using the two-tailed, non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank paired test. For these tests, whenever more than one agricultural field was paired with a background field, the data from the multiplematched agricultural fields were averaged. This produced 13 pairs of matched results. Astatistically significant difference was found between agricultural and background fields forcadmium and zinc, as well as DTPA zinc and DTPA cadmium (results not shown here).Page 38Table 2-4. Statistical summary of data. Analysis Metals Total Organic Carbon (TOC) weight Bolded numbers indicate a statistically significant difference Discussion Cadmium and zinc concentrations show a small but statistically significant increase in agricultural samples compared to concentrations in background samples (Tables 2-3 and 2-4).Increased concentrations of cadmium and zinc in agricultural fields suggest agricultural practicesmay have impacted soils over the past 50 years. No statistically significant differences werefound for arsenic, copper, lead, mercury, and nickel between agricultural and background sites.Soil concentrations of all metals in this study were typically less than or at the lower ranges ofthe comparison studies data. See figures in Appendix 2-J for a graphical comparison of thesedata to the studies discussed below.Page 39In order to put these results in context, the data were compared to three studies: Natural Background Soil Metal Concentrations in Washington State (Ecology, 1994b) Background Concentrations of Metals in Soils from Selected Regions in the State of Washington (Ames and Prych, 1995) Cadmium, Lead, Zinc, Copper, and Nickel in Agricultural Soils of the United States of America (Holmgren et al., 1993) It is important to understand the differences in these studies in order to evaluate the results. Numerical comparisons of these studies are found in Table 2-5. Ames and Prych (1995) andEcology (1994b) may not be entirely comparable to this study because of varying samplingdepths. The depth sampled in this study (surface to 30.5 cm) may capture effects of agriculturalpractices. The deeper depths used by Ames and Prych (61 to 96.5 cm) and Ecology (1994b)(surface to 91 cm) may represent agricultural practices differently. Although Ames and Prychsampling depths were different, arithmetic means for each metal were similar to all studies. Therange of values in the Ames and Prych study was greatest. Table 2-5. Comparison of arithmetic and geometric means of metal concentrations in soils. Arithmetic Mean (mg/kg) Soil Studies As Cd Cu Pb Hg Zn Agricultural Soils1,4 (n=20) 3Grant and Adams counties onl 4Non-detect (ND) = levelPage 40The Ecology (1994b) study determined \"natural background\" concentrations of metals in Washington State soils. To determine natural background concentrations of metals, the stud tried to avoid impacts from agricultural practices by using deeper sampling depths. Sampleswere collected statewide, by region. The two most comparable regions to this study were: Yakima Basin (Yakima, Kittitas, Chelan, and Grant counties) Group \"E\" (Benton, Spokane, Lincoln, Adams, Okanogan, and Whitman counties) Soil samples were collected from predominant soil series, and efforts were made to collect samples from undisturbed or undeveloped areas. Samples were collected from the groundsurface to a depth of about 91 cm (3 feet) (Ecology, 1994b). This is a distinct samplingdifference with this current study which sampled to a depth of about 30.5 cm (12 inches). Thesame analytical methods were used in both studies. For data analysis, Ecology (1994b) used one-half the detection limit value for non-detect values, per MTCA specifications (WAC 173-340-708(11)(e)). Ecology and the U.S. Geological Survey investigated the magnitude and variability of background metal concentrations in state soils (Ames and Prych, 1995). Samples in Ames andPrych were collected between 61 and 96.5 cm. Soil series sampled were Quincy, Shano, andTaunton. Region R (central Columbia Basin) in the Ames and Prych st udy was used for comparison to this study. The same methods and analyses were used in the Ames and Prychstudy as in this study. For data analysis, Ames and Prych used the laboratory's minimumreporting level for those values smaller than the minimum reporting level. The Holmgren et al. (1993) study analyzed 3,045 surface soil samples from 307 different soil types for several metals, including cadmium and zinc, throughout the United States. The primar purpose of their study was to assess the background levels of cadmium and lead in major foodcrops and in the soils of their major growing areas. Samples for Holmgren et al. were taken fromsurface soils (commonly 0-15 cm or 0-20 cm), compared to a depth of 30.5 cm used in this study.Ecology obtained county level data from Dr. Rufus Chaney, the corresponding author ofHolmgren et al. (Chaney, 1998). Although arithmetic mean concentrations for these metals arerelatively similar, their ranges vary considerably. The arithmetic and geometric means for Grantand Adams county data are presented in Table 2-5 and arithmetic means are gra phicall compared with the other studies in Appendix 2-J. For data analysis, Holmgren et al. used one-half the detection limit value for non-detect values. In this study, cadmium levels were less than 0.21 mg/kg in all agricultural sites and less than 0.098 mg/kg in all background sites. This corresponds with the Ecology (1994b) study in whichall Group \"E\" cadmium values were below detection limits (0.2 mg/kg); Yakima Basin meancadmium values were 0.55 mg/kg (Ecology, 1994b). Ames and Prych (1995) also found allcadmium concentrations below detection limits (0.2 mg/kg). Cadmium values in the Holmgrendata from Grant and Adams counties ranged from 0.1 to 0.26 mg/kg and were closer to theresults of this study. These studies imply that cadmium soil concentrations in the ColumbiaBasin are typically below 0.6 mg/kg.Page 41Zinc concentrations in this study ranged from 43.6 to 65.0 mg/kg in agricultural fields, with an arithmetic mean of 53.1 mg/kg. The Ecology (1994b) study reported similar values for Group Eand the Yakima Basin. Ames and Prych (1995) found zinc concentrations from 21.0 to116 mg/kg with an arithmetic mean of 50.0 mg/kg. Zinc concentrations in Grant and Adamscounties (Chaney, 1998) were also very similar to this study. See Table 2-5 for a comparison ofmeans between studies and Appendix 2-J for graphical representations of data ranges in thesestudies. Metal concentrations for arsenic, copper, lead, mercury, and nickel from this study werealso comparable with the above studies (see Table 2-5 and Appendix 2-J) with similar meanvalues, but ranges varied considerably. Zinc is a plant nutrient and necessary for normal plant growth (Amrani et al., 1997). Historically, eastern Washington calcareous soils were ex tremel zinc deficient, strongly limiting such crops as potatoes and beans. Because significant amounts of zinc have been added to agricultural soils- increasing concentrations to levels above background - crops such as potatoes and beans cansuccessfully be grown in eastern Washington (Stevens, 1999; Chaney, 1998). Certain pairs of metals, such as zinc and cadmium, compete with one another for plant absorption (Chaney et al., 1996). Although the presence of zinc is not a primary factor in cropcadmium uptake, under the right circumstances zinc soil concentrations could influence cropuptake of cadmium. Generally, when zinc soil concentrations are 100 times greater thancadmium soil concentrations (e.g., when the zinc to cadmium ratio is high), crops take up zincbefore cadmium. Also, the phytotoxicity of zinc can limit a crop's uptake of cadmium to levelsfar below that tolerated by the crop. (Chaney et al., 1996). Holmgren et al. (1993) noted that the crustal ratio of zinc to cadmium is often determined for comparison; that study used a value of 270 for the crustal ratio of zinc to cadmium. In thiscurrent study, the zinc-to-cadmium ratio was 516 for agricultural fields and 906 for backgroundsites using arithmetic means. Using geometric means, the agricultural field zinc to cadmiumratio is 550 and the background site ratio is 1062. The data from this study agrees with that ofHolmgren et al. (1993) that the zinc-to-cadmium ratio is high (>350) for those agricultural andnon-agricultural fields tested in central Washington. Data from this current study suggest that over the last 50 years agricultural practices may have increased cadmium concentrations over background levels in the Columbia Basin, althoughfurther investigation is necessary to confirm this. The metal concentrations of the fertilizers usedin the past are unknown, however, the highest cadmium levels in the fertilizer products sampledwere found in phosphate fertilizers (Chapter 1). Cadmium is a known contaminant of phosphatefertilizers (Mortvedt, 1987; Holmgren, et al., 1993; Chaney and Oliver, 1996). Although standards adopted in the past year by Washington State limit the amount of cadmium in fertilizers, the standards allow for the addition of metals in the soil. The current rate of increaseor how many years are required before these metals, particularly cadmium, could approach levelsof concern is not known, but will vary with farming practices, soil conditions, and other sitespecific considerations.Page 42Typical U.S. cadmium levels in agricultural soil pose little risk to human and ecosystem health, although cadmium is ubiquitous in the environment, (Gavi et al., 1997). Chaney et al. (1996)states \"excessive transfer of environmental cadmium to humans has no basis in actual cases ofhigh cadmium+zinc contamination except in rice paddies and in tobacco produc tion.\" That stud also noted that \"there is no evidence that bioavailable cadmium transfer in food and feed-chainsis higher today than in 1900 before cadmium became more widely dispersed by industrial andurban processes.\" To determine the portion of metals present in soil that may be available to growing plant life, single-extraction tests such as DTPA have been used (Speilman and Shelton, 1989;Quevauviller et al., 1998). Higher values indicate a metal is more available to growing plant life.A statistically significant difference was shown between agricultural DTPA-zinc and -cadmiumvalues and background DTPA-zinc and -cadmium values (Table 2-4). This indicates thatrelatively more zinc and cadmium is available to plants on the agricultural sites sampled than onthe background sites sampled. DTPA-arsenic, DTPA-copper, and DTPA-lead were notsignificantly different between agricultural and non-agricultural soils. In the original study design, the measurement of cation exchange capacity (CEC; the ability of a soil to adsorb and desorb micronutrient elements) was to be used to help identify soil series(Table 2-2). In this study, CECs (Table 2-3) averaged 158 meq/kg soil for agricultural soils and150 meq/kg soil for background soils. No statistical differences were found between agriculturalCEC and background site CEC. No statistical differences were found for pH and totalphosphorus between agricultural and background sites. Total phosphorus and pH are c ommonl recorded parameters for soil analyses. Total phosphorus results from this study will aid in furtherinvestigations of (1) the relationship between soil cadmium and phosphorus and (2) possiblecorrelations of cadmium to phosphate fertilizers. Conclusions Cadmium and zinc concentrations show small but statistically significant increases in agriculturalfields over background sites. DTPA-cadmium and DTPA-zinc values also show small butstatistically significant increases in agricultural soils compared to background soils. Nostatistically significant differences were found between agricultural and background sites forarsenic, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, DTPA-arsenic, DTPA-copper, DTPA-lead, total pH, total phosphorus, and cation exchange capacity (CEC). The data suggest that increased cadmium in agricultural fields may be due to farming practices used over the last 50 years. Further investigation is necessary to confirm this possibility. Theincreased zinc levels were purposefully established to correct nutrient deficiencies affecting cropproduction. The zinc-to-cadmium ratio suggests plants will preferentially uptake zinc overcadmium. The increased cadmium and zinc soil concentrations in agricultural fields sampledsuggest no potential soil quality impairment because the values detected are within the lowerrange of background comparison studies.Page 43All of the studies addressed above, including this study, yielded similar results for most metals with the exception of cadmium in the Yakima Basin. Overall, the similarities are more strikingthan the differences. Although the other studies typically reported greater soil concentrationranges than this study, arithmetic mean metal concentrations were similar. Washington fertilizer standards allow for the addition of metals in agricultural soils. It is important to determine (1) if metal concentrations increase in agricultural soils and (2) if they do, the rate of increase. State agricultural soils should be periodically monitored to determine a rateof increase and if this rate has been limited since the implementation of Washington Statefertilizer standards. In particular, increased agricultural cadmium levels over background levels indicate a need to periodically monitor cadmium concentrations in soils to determine any rate of increase andensure levels do not become a concern. Arsenic, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, and zincconcentrations should also be periodically monitored in soils to determine any rate of increaseand ensure levels do not become a concern. To this end, sources of cadmium in fertilizer products should be further investigated. Total phosphorus results from this study will aid in further investigations of (1) the relationshipbetween soil cadmium and phosphorus and (2) possible correlations of cadmium to phosphatefertilizers. As an example, fertilizers with high levels of cadmium - including UnitedAgricultural Products (UAP) 0-45-0, Frit F-503G, Agrium Ammonium Phosphate Sulfate, andNuLife Agro 10-15-10 - should be further reviewed. Knowing the rate of increase, if any, of metals in agricultural soils would assist in revising the Washington fertilizer standards, if needed, so concentrations of metals in agricultural soils do notreach a level of concern. A state Department of Agriculture/Washington State University crop-uptake study was initiated in the fall of 1998. It will evaluate the uptake of metals in certain crops in relationship to the new fertilizer standards. This report is due June 2001.Page 44Back-of-Page Placeholder for Duplex PrintingPage 453. Dioxins in Soils Purpose The objective of this study was to provide an initial assessment of typical dioxin concentrations in soils in Washington State, particularly agricultural soils . Low levels of dioxin are pervasive in the environment, probably due in large part to long-range transport and deposition of aerial particles from various combustion activities.7 Ecology sampled soils in open, forested, and urban areas to determine if dioxins occur in theseareas and at what levels. A data analysis technique called \"principal component analysis\" wasconducted to examine potential associations between the dioxin \"signatures\" in soil samples tothe signatures of potential dioxin sources. The original study design included sampling and analyzing agricultural soils for dioxins. However, due to difficulties in randomly selecting agricultural sites and an inability to guaranteeconfidentiality to landowners, this part of the study was postponed until the spring of 1999. Study Design Thirty soil samples were allocated to open, forested, and urban areas (Table 3-1). To evaluatepossible associations between soil sampling results and potential dioxin sources, a correlationanalysis called principle component analysis (PCA) was conducted. In addition to the soilsample results, 35 dioxin source sample results, along with data from nine fertilizer products thatcontained dioxin (reported in Chapter 1), were obtained for this evaluation. Dioxin sourceinformation was obtained from the literature (Appendix 3-A) and data obtained for theWashington State Dioxin Source Assessment (Yake et al., 1998). Open Areas Eight samples were collected from open areas. For this study \"open areas\" were defined as historically non-forested, non-agricultural, and located away from large urban areas. Sites werechosen based on spatial distribution (four samples each, from east and west sides of the state) andability to gain site access. Because only eight sites were located in open areas, no attempt wasmade to choose the samples randomly. Four of these eight samples were collected from grazedland, and the other four from conservation areas and reserves. 7 The word \"typical\" is used to describe the samples collected for this study, since the use of the term \"background\" implies a natural occurrence of these compounds.Page 46Table 3-1. Number of samples allocated by land use. Land Use East West Total Open 44 8 Grazed 2 2 Non-grazed 2 2 Forest 44 8 Managed (Commercial) 2 2 Parks (Non-commercial) 2 2 Urban 311 14 Seattle Area 9 Tacoma 2 Tri-Cities 2 Spokane 1 Total 1119 30 Two sites in eastern Washington were sampled to represent grazed land (rangeland). Both sites were on state lands managed by the state Department of Natural Resources. One site was locatednear Palouse Falls, and the other sample was collected from rangeland northeast of Ellensburg.In western Washington a sample was collected from a horse ranch in Clark County, and the othersample was collected from a dairy farm in Pierce County. Two sites on each side of the state were sampled to represent open, non-grazed land. Three of these sites were from national wildlife refuges, and the fourth sample was collected from anational park. Forest Land Eight soil samples were collected from forested areas. \"Forested sites\" were defined as areaswith an extensive canopy composed primarily of mature trees. Sites were chosen based onspatial distribution (e.g., east and west sides of the state) and ability to gain site access. Becausea total of only eight sites were located in forested areas, no attempt was made to choose thesamples randomly. Four samples were collected from areas actively managed for silviculture (e.g., sites that have been logged and are slated for future logging). Soil samples were obtained from both private andpublic forests. Two samples were collected from public forests: Wenatchee National Forest andOlympic National Forest. The other two samples were from private forests, one near the town ofNewport and one near the town of Rainier. Four soil samples were obtained from forested areas that had not been managed for timber harvest. Collection sites were (1) a state park in the southeast corner of the state, (2) OlympicNational Park, (3) Willapa National Wildlife Refuge, and (4) Pasayten Wilderness in theOkanogan National Forest.Page 47Urban Areas Fourteen of the 30 soil samples collected were allocated to urban areas. As defined by the U.S. Census Bureau (1997), an urbanized area comprises one or more places (central place) andthe adjacent densely settled surrounding territories (urban fringe) that together have a minimumof 50,000 persons. The urban fringe generally consists of contiguous territory having a density ofat least 1,000 persons per 256 hectares (one square mile). According to the U.S. Census Bureau(1998), Washington has 10 urbanized areas, comprising a total of 3,394 square kilometers. To allocate 14 sites within the urban areas, a random number generator was used on a database of 3,394 units, based on one-kilometer square grids representing the total urban area. Randomnumbers were used to allocate the sample count among the 14 urban areas. Sequential numberswere used to represent the one kilometer square grids, but not specific locations, within the 14listed urban areas of the state. The database was then sorted by these random numbers. The first14 units selected by this method determined the number of sites assigned to each urban areaselected for this study (Appendix 3-B). The greater Seattle area is the largest urban area in Washington State, both in terms of size and population. The majority (9) of the urban samples were assigned to this area. Using maps thatdefined urbanized areas, Ecology randomly selected public sites such as parks and other similargrass-covered landscapes for this study. Parks were used because they are generally not inindustrial areas or close to point sources of dioxins; they tend to be in residential areas and atleast one-acre (0.4-hectare). Approximately 300 sites listed as parks in the Seattle urban areawere entered into a database (Thomas Brothers Maps, 1989). To select these nine sites within the Seattle urban area, a random number generator function was used on the database. Each park was assigned a random number and the database was thensorted by these random numbers. The first nine parks (excluding parks within Seattle city limits)in the list that met the selection criteria were the sites selected for soil sampling. Seattle parkswere not sampled due to difficulty in getting timely information, as well as a lengthy permitprocess. Due to the small sample sizes allocated to the other urban areas (1-2 soil samples), no attempt was made to randomize site selection in these areas. Sites selected were in residential areaswithin the urban boundaries. Agricultural Soils Ecology encountered significant problems obtaining samples from agricultural lands and found itimpossible to gain permission to sample randomly selected agricultural sites within study timeconstraints. Ecology could not guarantee confidentiality of sampling results, so property ownerswere reluctant to have their soils tested. As a result, sampling of agricultural land waspostponed. Sampling of agricultural soils will take place during April and May 1999. Data from this phase of the study, sampling agricultural soils, will be published as an addendum to this report.Page 48Soil Sampling Procedures A global positioning system (GPS) was used to identify the starting point and sampling locations on the selected property. An attempt was made to avoid locating sampling sites near roads,railroad tracks, treated wood utility poles or fences, or areas of significant erosion. A sampling unit of one-acre (0.4-hectare) was selected; this was the largest practical unit that allowed for representative composite sampling. For example, finding an urban area of ten acres(4.05 hectares) suitable for sampling proved difficult. A one-acre (0.4-hectare) site allowed foruniform sized sampling units across all land uses. Samples were collected based, in part, upon guidelines developed for the EPA National Dioxin Study (EPA, 1984) and other published studies (Schuhmacher et al., 1997; Jim\u00e9nez et al., 1996;Creaser et al., 1990; Creaser et al., 1989). Each sample was a composite of ten samples collectedwithin the sampling unit. The initial sample was collected at a starting point (center), with nineadditional samples collected at the end of a radius originating from the starting point, extending adistance of 36 m (39 yards), and rotated at equal intervals of 40\u00b0. The surface layer of organicvegetative material was removed, and a sample was collected from a depth of 0-5 cm below thesurface to include an equal amount of material throughout the depth of the sample. Dioxins arerelatively immobile substances and do not appreciably leach through the soil. Each samplecontained approximately 120 cm 3 (6 ounces) of material, and was collected using dedicated utensils. Sampling apparatus was appropriately cleaned prior to sampling (Appendix 1-B). Samples were collected with a stainless steel scoop, placed in a stainless steel mixing bowl, and thoroughly mixed. Composite soil samples were mixed until the entire sample was uniforml consistent. Rocks, vegetation, and debris were removed from the samples in the field usingstainless steel tweezers. Samples were placed in ultra-clean sample jars with a Teflon lid fortransport and analyses. Each sample was analyzed for dioxin, total organic carbon (TOC), andgrain size. All samples were stored in a cooler and maintained at a temperature of 4\u00baC untilanalysis. A summary of sample handling procedures for dioxin is found in Table 3-2. Table 3-2. Dioxin analyses, container, and holding summary. Target Analyses Minimum Sample Size Holding Requirements 2,3,7,8-substituted PCDD/PCDF Method 8290(EPA 1994)10g sample in ultra clean glass jars with Teflon lidsCool to 4\u00b0C and keep dark; max. hold 30 days 8; analyze within 45 days of extraction Sample labeling, shipping, and chain-of-custody procedures as defined in the Manchester Environmental Laboratory Lab Users Manual (Ecology, 1994a) were followed. 8 The holding time of 30 days from collection to extraction is a recommendation. PCDDs and PCDFs are very stable in a variety of matrices, and holding times for samples stored at 4\u00baC in the dark may be as high as a year for certainmatrices.Page 49Analytical Procedures Analysis of 2,3,7,8-substituted PCDD/PCDF congeners (forms) was conducted a t MAXIM Technologies Inc./Pace An alytical, using high resolution GC/MS EPA Method 8290, with enhancements derived from Method 1613B.Detection limits varied dependin g on the physical state (e.g., moisture content and organic content) of the samples, but the target detection limit was 0.1 pptr. EPA Method 8290,Section 7.9.5, specifies the sample specific Estimated De tection Limit (EDL) as the concentration of a given an alyte required to produce a signal with a peak height of at least 2.5 times the background signal level. Not all the congeners were responsive enough to provideEDLs at 0.1 pptr. Data Quality This project is designed to provide data o n typical concentrations of dioxins in Washington State surface so ils. It is primarily for informative and descriptive purposes a nd does not test an specific hypothesis. The st udy was not designed to test whether specific land uses are associated with significant differences in dioxin levels, although general comparisons are made among land uses.For the comparison ana lysis, dioxin source data from th e Washington State Dioxin Source Assessment were not reviewed in e xtensive detail, \"however, eve ry attempt was made to use published data or data that were available for the public record .\" (Yake et al., 1998). The source data were used qualitatively, and not to determi ne dioxin loading in the environment. Representa tiveness This study was designed to provide an initial assessment of dioxin levels in surface soils. A combination of random and non-random sampling using spatial stratification (e.g., samples takenfrom locations across the state and across several land uses) provides adequate coverage and dataconsistent with pilot stud y objectives. However, conclusions based on data genera ted by this pilot study are limited, due p rimarily to small sample size and non-random sampling. Quality Control Procedures Established laborator y quality control procedures for this project met data qualit y objectives for laboratory precision and accur acy. Laborator y quality control tests were done on each set of 20 or fewer samples and consisted of blanks, duplicate samples, and spiked samples. ManchesterLaboratory quality control samples and procedures are discussed in Manchester Environmental Laboratory Lab Users Manual (Ecology, 1994a).Page 50Quality assurance and quality control measures indicate dioxin results are reliable. A number of the 17 congeners were detected in the associated method blank at concentrations below thelowest calibration standard. According to the method, re-analysis is not required when a targetcongener is detected below the lowest calibration standard. If the concentration of a congener ina sample was less than five times the method blank, a qualifier was added to the result specifyingthat the analyte was not detected at or above the (estimated) reported result. In cases where thesample concentration for a congener was greater than five times that of the method blank, theblank result is considered insignificant relative to the concentrations detected in the samples. Field quality assurance for this project consisted of two duplicate split samples. The differences in duplicate sample results reflect combined sampling and laboratory variability. The Richlandsplit samples were relatively close, with dioxin TEQs of 4.5 and 4.8 pptr. The split sample had TEQs of 0.33 and 0.98 pptr. Sample 98328339 was re-analyzed because only one of the 15 internal standards met the recovery criteria. For further details on quality control procedures, see Appendix 3-C. Data Analysis Principal component analysis (PCA) is a qualitative technique that was used to examine correlations between the dioxin signature (fingerprint) of the soil samples and potential dioxinsources. PCA is a data reduction tool used to reduce a number of variables (in this case, theten dioxin and furan congener groups in Table 3-3) to a few variables (linear components) thatdescribe the data with a minimum loss of information (Scheiner and Gurevitch, 1993). Thisprocess is called ordination. PCA is the oldest ordination technique and perhaps most widel known (Sparks et al., 1999), and is a common tool used to identify relationships among samplesand possible sources of dioxins. Dioxin samples are composed of a mixture of various dioxinsand furans. The ratio of the different congeners results in a particular signature that isidentifiable to the source. Similar processes result in a similar signature. The soil and sourcesamples can be plotted graphically using \"score plots.\" Similarities and differences can then beseen as distances between points. Clusters of points represent similarities in composition. Thecloser that samples are to one another, the greater the similarity. There are limitations to PCA. This analysis does not take into account environmental degradation of dioxins. Dioxins can be transported long distances once released into theatmosphere (Baker and Hites, 1999; Brzuzy and Hites, 1996; Tysklind et al., 1993). The dioxinsignature of a source may change over time and distance due to differences in volatilization,solubility, and rate of photodegradation of the different congeners, resulting in a dioxin signaturedifferent than from its source of origin (McPeters and Overcash, 1993; Podoll et al., 1986).Despite these limitations, PCA has been successfully used to interpret data and makecomparisons between signatures of dioxin sources and environmental samples (Bonn, 1998;Grundy et al., Abbreviation Degree of Chlorination (# of chlorine atoms per molecule) Tetrachlorinated dibenzofurans OCDD 8 A data matrix was created containing the analytical data of five groups of congeners (homologues) chlorination 3-D,-E). These ten congenergroup results listed in Table 3-3 were used for PCA. In order to maximize information content,the entire tetra- through octa-CDD/CDF congener data set was employed in the PCA. Thisfacilitated characterization of dioxin in soils and sources; PCA was not used to characterize TEQ. PCA was conducted using the statistical software package, SYSTAT 7.01 (SPSS, Inc., 1997). Percentages were used in PCA to remove biases due to concentration differences among samples.For congener groups that were not detected, a concentration equal to half the value of thedetection limit was assumed. The data set was transformed prior to analysis to approximate anear normal distribution. Percentages or proportions form a binomial rather than a normaldistribution (Zar, 1984). Results were transformed using an equation based on an arcsinetransformation developed by Freeman and Tukey (Zar, 1984). ++++=11arcsin1arcsin21'nX nXp Where: n = number of congener groups (10) X = original analytical value (percent)p' = transformed analytical valuePage 52Results and Discussion Dioxin TEQs TEQ refers to the toxic equivalents of dioxin congeners (different forms of dioxins and furans present) calculated as shown in Appendix 3-F. Unless otherwise specified, TEQ values reportedhere assume that if a specific congener is not detected in a sample its concentration is zero(ND = 0). See Appendix 1 for a discussion on dioxin TEQs and how they are calculated. A summary of the dioxin TEQ data is listed in Table 3-4. TEQs for each sample are listed in Appendix 3-G. Complete analytical results for the 17 congeners of concern for dioxins andfurans can be found in Appendix 3-F. The ten congener group results for the soil analyses can befound in Appendix 3-D; TOC and grain-size Appendix 3-H. Dioxinconcentrations are often correlated to organic content. In this study the correlation coefficientbetween dioxin (TEQ) and TOC of 0.34 (log-log correlation) approached, but did not meet,statistical significance at the 0.05 level ( p = 0.066). Table 3-4.

Every sample had detectablelevels of dioxins, even samples from remote wilderness areas. Dioxins are ubiquitous; they arefound throughout the state, most likely as a result of aerial deposition (Czuczwa et al., 1984;Czuczwa and Hites, 1986; Creaser et al., 1989; Rotard et al., 1994). The appropriate statistical measure of central tendency used to describe a distribution of data is based on what is known or suspected about the shape of the distribution. If data are distributedFigure3-1. DioxinTEQs of select soils - 19 Figure 3-2. soils samples and range of dioxin TEQs inWashington State. Page 55normally, the arithmetic mean is a good measure of the central tendency of data. If data are skewed to the right, the geometric mean is often used to describe the central tendency. For the soil dioxin data, most data are centered around the low end of the range (i.e., skewed to the right) with a few higher levels. Because this type of data distribution results in a mean that isnot truly representative of the central tendency of the data, the geometric mean or the medianmay be the most appropriate measure of central tendency of the data presented in Table 3-4. The range of results from urban areas is greater than the range of the other two land use areas. Urban areas also include the three sites with the highest soil dioxin TEQs. These results areconsistent with other studies comparing dioxin TEQs of urban lands to rural lands in Austria(Boos et al., 1992), Britain (Creaser et al., 1990), and Spain (Schuhmacher et al., 1997).Additional sources of dioxin data can be found in EPA (1994) and ATSDR (1998). No accepted (regulatory) background standard for dioxin levels exists for comparison to these data. In 1994, EPA released a draft report estimating a mean TEQ soil background level of 8pptr in the U.S. (EPA, 1994) assuming that non-detects were equal to half the detection limit.This was not based on any study or sampling that EPA conducted to determine typical orbackground levels, but was based on the mean of selected available data. Using half thedetection limit for calculating the average and median dioxin TEQs for this study, the results are4.2 and 2.9 pptr respectively. Some similar studies conducted in Europe can be used as a roughcomparison to this study. The dioxin TEQ soil levels found in this study are within the range ofsimilar studies conducted in Spain, Germany, and Austria (Figure 3-3). The data plotted for Spain come from two studies (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 1996; Schuhmacher et al., 1997). The dioxin TEQ values near an incinerator in Spain were calculated using half the valueof the detection limit for congeners not detected (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 1996). Median values fromGermany (Rotard et al., 1994) are based on international dioxin TEFs. The report does not statewhether congeners below the detection limit were given a value of zero for dioxin TEQcalculations. The sites sampled in Germany were outside of industrial and urban areas. Dioxins are unintended byproducts from processes such as combustion (Czuczwa and Hites, 1986; Creaser et al., 1990; Alcock and 1996); therefore, the sites closest to these sources(e.g., incinerators, industrial boilers, and cement kilns) have some of the highest dioxinconcentrations. A comparison between the east and west side of the state (Table 3-5), excludingurban samples, shows that the sites sampled in eastern Washington tend to have lower levels ofdioxin in the soils (Figure 3-4). This is not a conclusive statement, as the study was not designedto test differences between east and west sides of the state, nor were the sites randomly selected.However, this effect may be attributed to more people and greater development (i.e., urban areas)in western Washington.Figure3-3.

Although the Tacoma sites are located in residential areas, they mabe closer to industrial areas than the other urban sites sampled. Possible historical sources ofdioxin in Tacoma include hog fuel boilers, smelters, pulp and paper mills, as well as municipaland other incinerators. Tacoma has several cleanup sites with confirmed dioxin contamination(Yake et al., 1998). Forest sites appear to have dioxin levels greater than open areas. In Germany, forests have some of the highest levels of dioxins (Rotard et al., 1994) (Figure 3-3). Trees and vegetation may actas a large filter (Rotard et al., 1994; Horstmann et al., 1997) resulting in a greater surface area available for dioxin absorption and deposition than in open grassy areas. The leaves and needlesaccumulate volatile and particulate dioxins from the atmosphere, resulting in greater depositionof dioxins on the forest floor (Horstmann et al., 1997). In addition, organic matter in a forest is not harvested or removed as frequently as it is in areas managed for timber or agriculture. Thismay account for the apparent difference between commercial forests and the wilderness areas(geometric mean = 0.62 and 2.3 pptr respectively, Table 3-4), although a small sample size andnon-random sampling precludes making a definitive statement. Average dioxin TEQ values for grazed lands and non-grazed lands appear in Table 3-4. There are too few samples, and the median values are too similar, to speculate about potentialdifferences in dioxin levels of grazed and non-grazed lands. Guidelines and Standards Few guidelines or standards exist for dioxins in soil. Germany has guidelines (Schulz, 1993) fordioxin in soils based on dioxin TEQs 9. The guidelines recommend that no restrictions be placed on use of soil with dioxin levels below 5 pptr (ng/kg). At levels between 5-20 pptr (ng/kg)management systems should be implemented to reduce dust and pollution. At levels greater than40 pptr (ng/kg) it is recommended that fruits, legumes, and forage plants not be cultivated. Atlevels above 100 pptr (ng/kg) in playgrounds, soils should be removed (0 to 10-cm depth),decontaminated, or sealed. In residential areas \"measures should be taken to reduce soil contact,such as planting lawns, etc.\" (Schultz, 1993). In soils with dioxin levels above 10,000 pptr(ng/kg), the same measures should be taken to reduce soil contact as with residential areas; thisalso applies to levels above 10,000 (ng/kg), independent of location. 9 German guidelines for TEQs use half the value of the detection limit for congeners not detected at or above the detection limit.Page 59The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) has adopted an interim policy guideline to assess public health implications of dioxins in residential soils on or near hazardouswaste sites (DeRosa et al., 1997). Evaluation levels for dioxins are concentrations greater than50 pptr (0.05 ppb), and action levels are set at greater than 1 ppb. This policy provides aframework for evaluating the health implications of exposure to dioxins in residential soils on asite-specific basis. Within Washington State, three methods are used to determine cleanup levels under the Model Toxics Control Act: MTCA Methods A, B, and C (Ecology, 1996). These are basedupon contaminant concentrations designed to protect human health and the environment (cleanuplevels). Method A levels are appropriate for routine sites or sites that involve relatively fewcontaminants. Method B is the standard method for determining cleanup levels and may beapplicable to all sites. Method C is the conditional level where Method A or B may beimpossible to achieve, may cause greater environmental harm, or for industrial sites. No specific Method A level is listed for dioxins (PCDDs and or PCDFs); therefore, Method B or C would be used to determine cleanup levels at a site with dioxin. The Method B residential soilcleanup standard for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD) is 6.67 pptr (ng/kg) (Ecology, 1996). This standard is applied to cleanup or remediation sites known to becontaminated with dioxins. The calculated dioxin level for Method B cites a specific congener,2,3,7,8-TCDD (CAS 1746-01-6). It is the policy of the Ecology Toxics Cleanup Program toapply the dioxin TEQ when determining site cleanup levels. The cleanup level does not apply toan area unless it is classified as a cleanup site. None of the samples in this study had levels of 2,3,7,8-TCDD above the Method B cleanup level. Only four of the 30 soil samples had detectable levels of 2,3,7,8-TCDD, all in urban areas. Thesamples with TEQs above 6.67 pptr were the two urban sites from Tacoma. A proposed MTCA rule revision that addresses dioxins more specifically has been published for public comment (Ecology, 1998). The proposed change requires the use of TEFs (EPA, 1989)for assessing the potential carcinogenic risk of mixtures of chlorinated dibenzo- p-dioxins and chlorinated dibenzofurans, or assume the entire mixture is as toxic as 2,3,7,8-TCDD. Relationship between Dioxins in Soil and Dioxin Sources Data from 35 dioxin sources and nine fertilizer products containing dioxin were compared to theresults from the 30 soil samples of this study. A PCA analysis was conducted to eval uate an potential relationship between the dioxin signature of soil samples with that of dioxin sources. The dioxin source raw data are tabulated in Appendix 3-E. This is not an inclusive list of dioxin sources. Other sources of dioxin were not included in this report, because there were no reliabledata available. Potential dioxin sources not included in this analysis were emissions from motorvehicles, oil combustion, wood burning (fireplaces), and trash barrels. Pesticides such as 2,4-DPage 60(2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) and 2,4,5-T (2,4,5- trichlorophenoxyacetic acid) known to be contaminated with dioxins were not included either (Schecter et al., 1997). Many of theWashington dioxin source data were obtained from the Washington State Dioxin Source Assessment (Yake et al., 1998). The data used from the Source Assessment were primarily aerial emission data from combustion sources, including municipal and hospital waste incinerators, acement kiln, and a remelt furnace from an aluminum plant. A detailed data quality review wasnot conducted on the data obtained from the Source Assessment (Yake et al., 1998). However,only data reporting complete results for the ten dioxin congener groups were used. The fertilizerinformation was obtained from Chapter 1, Metals and Dioxins in Fertilizer Products , of this report. Only those materials containing dioxin at levels above 5 pptr TEQ were included. None of the pulp and paper mill samples was from aerial emissions. Of the three samples from pulp and paper mills included in this analysis, one was wood ash, one was fly ash, and one waseffluent from a Kraft mill. No useable dioxin source data from pentachlorophenol (PCP), sodium pentacholorphenate (PCP-Na), or biosolids were available within Washington, so this information was obtained fromthe literature. Commercial formulations of PCP chemicals were analyzed for dioxin content(Hagenmaier and Brunner, 1987). One of the two biosolids samples is a median value from theNational Sewage Sludge Survey (EPA 1989). The other biosolids sample was reported as atypical or representative sample from the United Kingdom (Duarte-Davidson et al., 1997). Due to the limited source data available from Washington, some of the data included were multiple measurements from the same source under different operating conditions at differenttimes. Only data believed to be representative of normal operating conditions were included inthe database, with the exception of an activated carbon regenerating facility (Cameron-Yakima).The Cameron-Yakima emissions data are thought to be a \"moderate worst case\" test usingprepared feed material (Yake et al., 1998); however, the facility ceased operation in 1997. TheCameron-Yakima facility was included because it was the only facility of its type in the state, andone of the few on the east side of the state. When it was operating it had the highest dioxinloading in the state of the facilities that had available dioxin information (Yake et al., 1998). PCA was used to examine the association between the dioxin signature of the soil samples and those of potential dioxin sources. PCA reduced the ten original variables derived from thesample results to three main principal components, based on a criteria of having the principalcomponents account for at least 70% of the original variance of the data set. The first threeprincipal components accounted for about 73% of the total variation of the original data set. Thecomponent \"loadings\" are correlations of the ten original variables with the principal components(Appendix 3-I). A comparison of the loadings within a principal component indicates whichvariables have the greatest influence on that particular component. Figure 3-5 is a plot of thefirst two principal component scores for each sample. Several dioxin signature patterns can berecognized by the grouping of various samples.s =soil sample s ss sss s ssss ss sss s s ss i iii i i iiii i ii ii i iiii i mip Two ofthe soils and source samples. Ellipses represent closelyrelated groups, and the small numbers referto theidentification of the sample (see Appendices 3-E, 3-H).Page 62The first principal component, and the one that accounted for the most variability (42%), was a combination of the tetra- through and CDFs (Appendix 3-I). Samples with a highscore for this principal component had high levels of the lower chlorinated congener groups andlow levels of the higher chlorinated congeners. The second principal component accounted forapproximately 19% of the variability. For samples scoring high on principal component 2, ateach level of chlorination, furans (PCDFs) contributed more to the dioxin percentage of thesample than the corresponding dioxin groups (PCDDs). The third principal component wascharacterized by samples with relatively high levels of penta- through hepta- CDDs and CDFs. A plot of the two main principal component scores for each sample is shown in Figure 3-5. Although the first two principal components account for only 61% of the total variance, it ismuch easier to represent graphically than using the three main principal components. A slightrandom \"jitter\" was introduced to the plotting program to counteract overlapping values. Thecloser a sample is to another, the more closely related their signatures are to one another. Basedon the analysis, approximately six clusters or groups emerged: soils, biosolids, PCP, pulp andpaper mills, incinerators, and metal associated materials. Figure 3-6 shows a dioxin profile(signature) for six groups. The incinerator and soil groups have relatively variable congenersignatures and, as a result, encompass a portion of the other groups. Soil samples showed a high degree of variability but tended to cluster in the upper left quadrant of Figure 3-5. Soil samples are represented by an S and are numbered 1 through 30. With theexception of the incinerators, there was a distinct grouping of the \"dioxin signatures\" from eachof the dioxin sources. The two biosolid samples are located within the grouping for soil samples (Figure 3-5). The dioxin signature for biosolids is somewhat intermediate between the signatures of soils and PCP(Figure 3-6). The four PCP samples (59-62) clustered together, overlapping somewhat with the soil grouping. PCP samples are also close to the biosolids; this may be due to PCPs being a primary source ofdioxins in biosolids, possibly contaminants in cotton clothing produced from raw materials thathave been treated with PCP (Broman et al., 1990; Horstmann and McLachlan, 1995; Jones andSewart, 1997). Chapter 1 of this report discusses in more detail the potential sources of dioxinsin biosolids. Both PCP and biosolid signatures were dominated by the higher level chlorinateddioxins, hepta- and octa-CDDs and CDFs (Figure 3-6). Dioxin signatures of wastes from pulp mills clustered together, even though samples were collected from different facilities and different media (effluent 54, fly ash 69, wood ash 58).Another sample was pulp mill fly ash; this is used as a fertilizer product marketed as NutriLime(65). The pulp mill samples had relatively high scores for all three principal compone nts. The were dominated by tetra- to penta- CDDs and CDFs (component 1), as well as overall low valuesof PCDFs compared to PCDDs (component 2), with the exception of TCDF (Figure 3-6).Figure3-6. Dioxinsignatures of various (hospitals, municipal, and the cement kiln) were highly variable in terms of dioxin signatures. There was some overlap between patterns for incinerators and materials associatedwith metals processing (Figure 3-6). Materials associated with metals processing included(1) fertilizer products (samples 63-72) composed of Frit products, Bay Zinc products, NuLifeAll Purpose Trace Elements, and McLendon Weed and Feed (2) emissions from the aluminumremelt furnace (sample 52), and (3) a sample from Cameron-Yakima (sample 37). Thesesamples grouped together because they have a common source signature. They all are derivedfrom similar processes, with an association to metal processing or combustion of metal materials.The fertilizer products are discussed in more detail in Chapter 1. It is believed these fertilizershave, as a component, material that is derived from steel mill flue dust. Conclusions This report is not a conclusive analysis of the source of dioxins in Washington State soils;however, it does provide some insights. Due to limitations in data quality (i.e., non-random sampling and small sample numbers), this screening survey did not statistically compare dioxin soil levels among different land uses;however, several observations were made. Dioxins are found in surface soils throughout Washington State. They were detected in all samples, including samples from remote wilderness areas. Dioxin TEQs in soils sampled rangedfrom 0.033 to 19 pptr, with a median value of 1.2 pptr. The three highest values of dioxins were from urban areas. Urban areas also had the greatest range of TEQ values (0.13- 19 pptr). Soils in forested areas appear to have a higher level ofdioxins than soils in open areas; however, more samples would be required to verify this. Theresults of this study indicate that the levels of dioxins detected in these selected Washington Statesoils are comparable to the results of studies in Spain, Germany, and Austria. An analysis of the soil samples and potential dioxin sources using principal component analysis clearly showed differences among the dioxin signatures of soil and source samples. Furthermore,dioxin signatures differed considerably within soil samples, as well as between soils and sourcesamples. None of the soil samples is clearly linked to any specific dioxin source. In summary, soil signatures do not coincide exactly with any of the source signatures evaluated. The closest correlations appear to be with the dioxin congeners associated with PCP andbiosolids. The apparent correlation between soils and biosolids signatures may be due to thesimilarity in sources contributing to these receptors. Much additional work is needed (e.g., testsof additional source types, understanding changes in signatures caused by weathering of soils)before the relative dioxin contribution of various sources can be well understood. It is likely, however, that multiple sources are involved and that air-borne deposition is an importantmechanism in the contamination of soil.Page 65Summary of Conclusions This final report includes a description and findings for three studies (1) metals and dioxins in fertilizer products, (2) metals in soils, and (3) dioxins in soils. These studies provide a betterunderstanding of contaminants in fertilizer products and how some fertilizer components may beaffecting Washington State soils. 1. Metals and Dioxins in Fertilizer Products The objective of this study was to quantify metals and dioxins in fertilizer products. Ecolog randomly sampled and analyzed fertilizer products including 50 bulk agricultural and home-usefertilizers, and micronutrients, to determine their dioxin concentrations. The samples were alsoanalyzed to determine heavy metal concentrations. Metals in Fertilizer Products Fertilizer products were analyzed for total metals and leachable metals using the Toxicit Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP). TCLP is used to designate dangerous wastes underthe Washington State Dangerous Waste Regulations. TCLP is being used by Ecology as ascreening criterion to evaluate whether waste-derived fertilizers meet applicable standards. Of the 50 products tested, seven failed the TCLP. Two bulk or packaged agricultural fertilizers, one agricultural micronutrient fertilizer, and four home-use packaged fertilizers failed the test forcadmium. Concentrations of cadmium ranged from 1.04 to 2.52 ppm, compared to a federal andstate criterion of 1.0 ppm for designation of dangerous waste. The TCLP metals limits appear to be an adequate screening criterion for predicting whether fertilizers are in compliance with the current land disposal restriction (LDR) standards.Dangerous-waste-derived fertilizers must meet the LDR standards before they are registered asfertilizers in Washington. Two of the seven fertilizers with high levels of cadmium (relative to the others tested) are potentially hazardous-waste-derived from steel mill flue dust (K061). One of these products(Frit F-503G) has used a non-hazardous waste source of zinc since 1988. K061 is cur rentl exempt from hazardous waste regulations if it is used to make zinc-containing fertilizer;however, through the rule-making process Ecology will propose the elimination of the K061exemption. Dioxins in Fertilizer Products Most of the fertilizer products tested contained non-detectable or extremely low levels of dioxin.Seventy-two percent (or 36) of the 50 fertilizer products tested had dioxin TEQs of less than 0.1 pptr. A few bulk agricultural fertilizers contained relatively high levels of dioxin. Twofertilizer products had dioxin TEQs NuLifeAll-Purpose Trace Elements (54 pptr).Page 66Most of the fertilizers that were sampled had lower dioxin TEQs than the soils surve yed. Onl two of the fertilizer products sampled in 1998 and two of the fertilizer products sampled in 1997had dioxin TEQs higher than any of the TEQs found in the soils dioxin study. However, thedioxin level in soils after fertilizer products are applied is dependent on application rate. Thefour products with high TEQs are micronutrients that are applied to soils at very low rates.Calculations of soil concentrations after mixing found that the micronutrients add a minimalamount of dioxins to soil. A literature review found no studies of dioxin levels in fertilizers. There are no applicable standards for dioxin in fertilizers at this time. Dioxins in Biosolids Dioxins have been found to accumulate in biosolids and have been measured in nearly allbiosolids tested. The national data available on dioxin levels in biosolids are more than ten years old, and there are few biosolids data for Washington State. Review of statewide biosolids data and additionalsampling are needed. Initial data interpretation using principal component analyses (PCA) is consistent with the published data suggesting that pentachlorophenol (used to treat cotton for clothing) may be asource of dioxin in municipal biosolids. 2. Metals in Soils The objective of this study was to determine if certain metals have accumulated in agriculturalsoils of the Columbia Basin in Washington State. Ecology analyzed agricultural and non-agricultural (background) soils from the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project for seven metalconcentrations and compared the results with two other state soil studies. The 33 sites werelocated primarily in Grant County. Twenty samples came from agricultural soils and 13 fromnon-agricultural soils. To the extent possible, agricultural and non-agricultural soils werematched. Zinc and cadmium concentrations show small but statistically significant increases in agricultural fields when compared to background sites. Increased cadmium levels on agricultural f ields ma be due to the farming practices used over the last 50 years. Further investigation is necessary toconfirm this possibility. The increased zinc levels were purposefully established to correctnutrient deficiencies affecting crop production. The zinc-to-cadmium ratio in this study suggestsplants will take up zinc before cadmium. The increased cadmium and zinc soil concentrations inagricultural fields sampled suggest no potential soil quality impairment because the valuesdetected are within the lower range of background comparison studies.Page 67The levels of arsenic, copper, mercury, nickel, lead, total organic carbon, pH, total phosphorus, and cation exchange capacity in soils do not show statistically significant differences betweenagricultural fields and background sites. The increased agricultural cadmium levels warrant monitoring over a period of time to determine their rate of increase and to ensure that the levels do not become a concern. To this end, sourcesof cadmium in fertilizers should be investigated (e.g., phosphate or zinc fertilizer products).Arsenic, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, and zinc concentrations in soils should also beperiodically monitored to determine any rate of increase and ensure that levels do not become aconcern. Data on the rate of increase of metals in agricultural soils will provide information sothat Washington fertilizer standards could be adjusted, if needed, so concentrations of thesemetals in agricultural soils do not reach a level of concern. 3. Dioxins in Soils The objective of this study was to provide an initial assessment of typical dioxin concentrationsin soils in Washington State. Ecology obtained 30 soil samples in open, forested, and urbanareas to determine if dioxins occur in these areas and at what levels. Testing showed that dioxins are found in surface soils throughout Washington State with values ranging from 0.033 to 19 pptr. All samples had detectable levels of dioxin, including samplesfrom remote wilderness areas. In general, average dioxin levels appear to be higher in urbanareas than forested and open areas. Three of the highest detected values of dioxins were fromurban areas. This was expected since the primary source of dioxins is from combustionprocesses. The results of this study indicate that the levels of dioxins detected in these selectedWashington State soils are comparable to the results of studies in Spain, Germany, and Austria. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the soil samples and several potential dioxin sources. This PCA is not a conclusive analysis of the source of dioxins in WashingtonState soils; however, it does provide some insights. The analysis clearly showed differencesbetween the dioxin signatures of soil and source samples. None of the soil samples is clearllinked to any specific dioxin source. Soil signatures do not coincide exactly with any of thesource signatures evaluated. The closest correlations appear to be with the dioxin congenersassociated with PCP and biosolids. The apparent correlation between soils and biosolidssignatures may be due to the similarity in sources contributing to these receptors. Much additional work is needed (e.g., tests of additional source types, understanding changes in signatures caused by weathering of soils) before the relative dioxin contribution of varioussources can be well understood. It is likely, however, that multiple sources are involved and thatair-borne deposition of particulates from combustion sources is an important mechanism in thecontamination of soil. Ecology is sampling agricultural soils for dioxin during April-May 1999. The results of that study will be published as an addendum to this report.Page 68Back-of-Page Placeholder for Duplex PrintingPage 69Recommendations and Actions Washington State departments of Ecology, Health, and Agriculture recommend Continue to implement the Fertilizer Regulation Act by ongoing review, sampling, and analysis of fertilizer products for metals as specified under the Memorandum ofUnderstanding among these agencies. In the biennial report to the Legislature (first report due December 1, 1999), report levels of non-nutrient substances in fertilizer products. Continue to monitor the levels of metals and other contaminants, as appropriate, in fertilizer products, especially waste-derived materials and phosphate fertilizers. Monitor agricultural soils to determine a rate of increase for metals in soils. Continue to monitor the progress of EPA and other agencies and organizations in evaluating health and environmental risks associated with fertilizer use. Continue to encourage EPA to: Complete and release the dioxin risk assessment report and the cement kiln dust report that is expected to have standards for dioxin in cement kiln dust. Adopt metals and dioxin standards for hazardous-waste-derived fertilizers and cement kiln dust used as fertilizers or soil amendments. Conduct an assessment of all fertilizer products, as well as related research, and develop risk-based metals and dioxin standards. Monitor EPA progress on their evaluation of dioxins in biosolids. A proposed EPA rule, due in December 1999, would provide additional direction in this matter. Monitor and review other states or countries development of standards for metals or dioxins in fertilizers or soil amendments. Ecology complete the study of dioxins in agricultural soils during the spring of 1999. Determine if more sampling of dioxins in fertilizers is needed. Review and supplement data on dioxins in biosolids from municipalities.Page 70Back-of-Page Placeholder for Duplex PrintingPage 71Ecology Policy Options for Managing Persistent, Bioaccumulative, and Toxic Chemicals in Fertilizers In August 1998, Ecology announced an agency-wide initiative to address certain contaminants in our environment that are persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT). Ecology is developing astrategy to address the following challenges: 1. Prevent the generation of PBT chemicals 2. Virtually eliminate the release of PBTs in the environment 3. Effectively manage or clean up PBT contamination where possible Ecology's proposed PBT initiative is included in this discussion because of the overlap between PBTs and waste-derived fertilizer products. At least three PBTs were found in some fertilizerproducts: dioxins, cadmium, and mercury. While Washington recently adopted standards forcadmium and mercury in fertilizer products, it does not have standards for dioxins. In addition,no standards exist for dioxins in fertilizer products in other states or countries (Schultz, 1993). The options listed below for addressing PBTs are included in this report to provide a more complete picture of the regulatory and non-regulatory alternatives under consider ation b Ecology to address the issue of contaminants in fertilizer products. These options are potentialactions and interim steps for addressing PBTs in fertilizer products. Ecology will consult withthe Departments of Agriculture and Health as issues related to addressing PBTs in fertilizerproducts unfold. Ecology options for PBTs in fertilizer Eliminate the steel mill flue dust (K061) exclusion in the Washington State Dangerous Waste Regulations (chapter 173-303 WAC) to reduce a source of metals and dioxins in waste-derived fertilizers. Re-evaluate the wood ash exclusion in the state Dangerous Waste Regulations (chapter 173-303 WAC) to determine the impact of the exclusion as a possible contributor to dioxin insoils. Amend the state Dangerous Waste Regulations and set a dioxin standard for waste-derived fertilizers. Possible standards are: Non-detectable level of dioxins \"Background\" or \"typical\" levels based on existing levels of dioxin in soil Levels based on reasonable available tec hnology to remove dioxins from fertilizers and their component sources Levels that would eliminate the top 10% of highest dioxin concentrations found Use of the EPA standard from the cement kiln dust report (when final)Page 72 Set a standard for dioxins in all hazardous waste. Encourage EPA to address the issue of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic chemicals in fertilizers nationally. Address and eliminate sources of the highest releases of PBTs to the environment. Examine sources other than fertilizer products to determine if they have higher releases of PBTs to the environment. Ask the Legislature to (1) set strict standards for PBTs in all fertilizer products or (2) ban all dangerous waste from being made into fertilizer products. Require fertilizer companies with waste-derived fertilizers to test and report levels of dioxins to Ecology without mandating a standard, to obtain more information about current levelsbefore considering establishing a standard. Reward companies with publicity/awards for manufacturing and selling fertilizer products with negligible concentrations of dioxins or PBTs. Ecology recommendations for PBTs in fertilizers and biosolids Work with stakeholders to develop a strategy to minimize PBTs and other metals of concern in fertilizer products. Continue to determine the levels of PBTs in fertilizer products, as well as levels of PBTs in agricultural soils, and share that information with the public in a timely manner. Commit to a regulatory process to eliminate the steel mill flue dust (K061) exemption in the state Dangerous Waste Regulations in order to reduce a source of metals and dioxins inwaste-derived fertilizers. Actively engage the biosolids regulated community in investigating the significance of PBTs in biosolids, and in developing appropriate policy and direction. Conduct a complete sampling program of dioxins in biosolids in Washington State, or review data from municipalities in the state and supplement these data, as needed.Page 73References Zoonen, 1996.

Conventions used in calculating TEQs Dioxins occur in many forms or congeners. Of the 210 congeners of polychlorinated dibenzo- p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDDs/PCDFs), only 17 with chlorine atoms in the 2,3,7,8 positions are considered highly toxic ( Birnbaum, 1994). Seven PCDDs and ten PCDFs have this configuration. 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- p- dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD) is the most toxic. While PCDDs and PCDFs with chlorine atoms in the 2,3,7,8 positions are considered the most toxic, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran (2,3,7,8-TCDF) is considered 1/10 as toxic as 2,3,7,8-TCDD. The ratios adopted by international convention (EPA, 1989) are the basis for the calculation of TEQs as shown in the table below and in Appendices 1-P, 1-Q, and 3-C. TEQ is the sum of the toxicity of the forms present. Table 1. Toxicity equivalent factors (TEF) for the 17 PCDDs and PCDFs.

Three approaches to this dilemma are often used: A. One approach assumes that if a congener is not detected, its concentration is zero. The TEQ is calculated assuming no contribution from the undetected congeners (ND = 0). This approach yields the minimum value for the calculated TEQ.Appendices - Page 4B. A second approach assumes the congener(s) may have been present at concentrations as high as the detection limit. The TEQ is calculated assuming undetected congeners are present at the detection limit (ND = DL). This approach yields the maximum value for the calculated TEQ. C. A third approach takes the intermediate path and assumes undetected congeners are present at half the detection limit (ND = \u00bd DL). This approach yields a value for the calculated TEQ intermediate between the first and second method. The tables in the report text are based on TEQ values calculated using method A described above (e.g., concentrations of undetected congeners are assumed to equal zero). Full analytical results and TEQ calculations for soil and fertilizer samples using these three methods are listed in Appendices 1-P, 1-Q, and 3-C The difference between minimum and maximum results for a single sample (methods A and B) ranged from 0 to 11 pptr for fertilizer samples, and 0 to 8 pptr for soils. The largest differences are generally found where the detection (or quantification) limits are relatively high. High detection limits are often associated with samples high in complex organic matter, from which it is difficult to extract dioxins. The fertilizer samples with the highest differential between minimum and maximum calculated TEQ were Ponderay Newsprint Fiberay SC (consisting of paper fibers and wood chips) and Kelly Green Recycled Fresh Fish. Both of these materials would be expected to have high concentrations of complex organic matter.Appendices - Page 5Appendices for 1.

Metals data for multiple and duplicate samples - 1998 sampling results Variations in product, as well as analyses, can be determined by comparing the results of two samples of several products collected independently. The analyses for Samples #1 and #2 of the Cozinco zinc micronutrient product gave similar results. Note that these samples were obtained from different sources and are not duplicate samples. Although the average RPD for detected pairs of like metals was 57%, the results for each metal agreed within 5.4 mg/kg- dw. Analyses for total metals were expressed in terms of dry weight ( dw), so that the concentration of metals reported represents the concentration in a dried sample. The two Fort James NutriLime sample results were also similar, with an average relative percent difference of 24% for detected pairs of like metals. The two samples of Frit F- 503G gave divergent results, with an average RPD of 78%. Cadmium, lead, and silver concentrations for those samples differed considerably.

Standards for the maximum addition of metals to soils by the application of commercial fertilizers The Washington Standards for Metals were adapted from an existing set of Canadian standards for metals in fertilizers as directed by law RCW 15.54.820.

The Ecology fertilizer review process Beginning July 1, 1999, the fertilizer review process required by law (RCW 15.54.820) states that the Washington State Department of Ecology will: Review waste-derived and micronutrient fertilizers to determine if products pass dangerous waste criteria. Advise if these products should be registered by the Washington State Department of Agriculture for use as a fertilizer in Washington State (Washington State Register, 1998). Ecology review criteria for waste-derived and micronutrient fertilizers require fertilizer manufacturers to provide information in addition to that required by the Department of Agriculture for the annual registration of fertilizer products to be distributed and sold in Washington. That additional information will enable Ecology to determine if these products meet the state Dangerous Waste (DW) Regulations for dangerous wastes to be applied to the land. If these products are unable to meet Ecology's review criteria, or the manufacturers are unable to otherwise prove that the DW Regulations do not apply, Ecology will not recommend the product for registration by the Department of Agriculture. The Ecology review criteria are: Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) analyses for arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, selenium, and silver. Total Halogenated Organic Compounds ( HOCs). Total Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs). If a fertilizer product exceeds the regulatory limit for any of these criteria, the manufacturer must provide documentation to Ecology showing the product is not subject to the state DW Regulations or showing that the product is in compliance with the DW Regulations.Lab Log# Abbreviated Product Description As Ba Cd Cr Ag mg/kg-dw mg/kg-dw mg/kg-dw 4.3 13.0 0.2U0.0768 Sample 2UJ058172 bold detected value U -The analyte was not detected at or above the reported result.

Site selection criteria for metals in soils study Selection criteria for agricultural field sampling included ( Holmgren et al., 1993): No obvious aerial deposition from industrial or automotive sources. Sites selected should be at least: 8 km downwind from any stack emitter such as coal-fired generators, smelters, and foundries, 200 m from US or state highways such as I-90, 100 m from rural roadways, 100 m from current, abandoned, or known obliterated building sites, and 50 m from field boundaries. No known use of orchard pesticides such as lead arsenate; sites should be at least 8 km downwind of active orchard pesticides to minimize drifting. No known applications of biosolids or sewage sludge. If an appropriate matched non-agriculture site cannot be located, an agriculture site will be excluded.Appendices - Page 41Appendix 2-B. Landowners' reasons for rejecting study participation None of the landowners contacted had heard of this study before our initial contact. Each contacted landowner was given the same information about the study and given the opportunity to ask questions or consult with others before deciding. Only two of the eight landowners who rejected the opportunity to participate opted to consult with other people prior to rejecting the opportunity. The other six rejections occurred during the initial contact. Those contacts were short, lasting only several minutes, with few questions from the landowners. Listed below are the reasons given for not choosing to participate in this study . \"I don't trust the Government.\" \"I don't like Ecology and this is against Cenex and the Farmers.\" \"I don't like the idea of it.\" \"This hits me cold, I don't have enough information about it, I might say yes if I had heard about it before.\" \"I don't trust the government and I don't like some of the things they are doing like the nitrogen in the groundwater issue and talking about removing the dams for the salmon.\" \"I have leased the farm and I don't think the operator would want you to trample the corn ( unharvested corn field).\" Neither of the two landowners who took several days to decide gave a reason for not participating.Appendices - Page 42Appendix 2-C.

General chemistry quality assurance Sample Information Samples from the Metals in Soils study were received by the Manchester Laboratory on 8/l 8 and 8/26/98 in good condition. Analysis for percent solids was performed immediately after sample arrival. The samples were not stored in the freezer until TOC analysis could be performed due to the shorter turnaround time for this project. Holding Times Soil TOC analysis, as well as pH analysis, was not performed within laboratory accepted holding times. The TOC method in the Conventional Sediment Variables of the Puget Sound Protocols of March 1986 recommends that the samples should be stored frozen and can be held for up to 6 months. There is no known established regulatory holding time for TOC sediment for samples that are stored at 4\u00b0C. Due to pH probe drifting problems, the pH samples also were analyzed outside the laboratory established holding times. There is also no known established regulatory holding time for this parameter. Instrument Calibration Where applicable, instrument calibration was performed before each analysis, and verified by initial and verification standards and blanks. All initial and continuing calibration verification standards were within the relevant EPA control limits. All balances are calibrated yearly with calibration verification occurring monthly. Procedural Blanks All procedural blanks were within acceptable limits. Precision Data The results of the duplicate and triplicate analysis of samples were used to evaluate the precision on this sample set. Relative percent differences (RPD) were within their acceptance windows of +/- 20%. The relative standard deviations (RSD) were within their acceptance windows of +/- 20%. Laboratory Control Sample (LCS) Analyses LCS and standard reference materials (SRM) analyses were within their acceptance windows of +/- 20%. Other Quality Assurance Issues The results for the three pH duplicates have been qualified as estimates. These samples were analyzed from leftover supernatant that was left on the counter overnight.Appendices - Page 48Appendix 2-H. Metals analysis quality assurance summary Data quality for this project met all quality assurance and quality control criteria with the exceptions that (1) recoveries of ICP and furnace elements were high for one of the three LCS samples, (2) recovery of lead from one of the spiked samples was low, and (3) replication of DTPA extractable copper and zinc from one sample was outside limits. Because of several miscommunications at Manchester Laboratory, the mercury soil samples were not analyzed within the recommended holding time (28 days) for mercury in solid matrices. The lab does not feel that any mercury was lost from these samples before analysis, as the great majority of the samples are very dry and do not appear to have much biological or chemical activity associated with them. Additionally, the storage that these samples received (4\u00baC, sealed, dark), indicate that loss of mercury would probably be minimal. However, we are qualifying the sample with J, denoting estimated values, recognizing that there is a possibility that some mercury may have been lost in storage. To verify the stability of the samples and their mercury content, the lab will re-analyze the samples toward the end of October. This re-analysis will be free of charge. If the concentration has not substantially changed at this re-analysis, the lab will recommend that the J qualifiers be removed from the data set. No other significant quality assurance issues were noted with the data. No certified reference materials were available for either DTPA extractable metals or for the cation exchange capacity (CEC). Spiked samples were not analyzed with these two methods. Sample Information The samples from the Metals in Soils study were received by the Manchester Laboratory on 08/l 8/98 and 8/26/98 in good condition. Holding Times All analyses, except those for mercury, were performed within the specified method holding times for metals analysis, 180 days for all metals except mercury. Mercury was analyzed at a time in excess of the 28-day holding time due to laboratory error. Mercury data were qualified J, as estimated, or UJ, as undetected at estimated detection level. Instrument Calibration Instrument calibration was performed before each analytical run and checked by initial calibration verification standards and blanks. Continuing calibration standards and blanks were analyzed at a frequency of 10% during the run and again at the end of the analytical run. All initial and continuing calibration verification standards were within the relevant method control limits. PLA calibration gave a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.995 or greater, also meeting method calibration requirements.Appendices - Page 49Procedural Blanks The procedural blanks associated with these samples showed no analytically significant levels of analyte except zinc. Zinc was present in two of the three ICP procedure blanks. Sample zinc results were greater than ten times the blank results, so the data were not qualified. Spiked Samples Analysis Spiked and duplicate spiked sample analyses were performed on this data set. All spike recoveries, with the exception of that for the lead spike on sample 98338710, were within the acceptance limits of +/- 25%. Recovery of the noted spike was 63%. Recovery from the duplicate spiked sample was acceptable and the average recovery, 74%, from this sample was marginal. Data were not qualified based on this result on one out of three spiked samples; spiked samples were not analyzed for DTPA extractable metals or with the CEC analysis. Precision Data The results of the spiked and duplicate spiked samples and duplicate sample results were used to evaluate precision on this sample set. The relative percent difference (RPD) for all analytes was within the 20% acceptance window for duplicate analysis. Mercury results for sample 98338710 had acceptable precision based on spiked sample results but not on duplicate sample results. The duplicate may have been contaminated or the sample matrix non-homogenous. Data for this sample was qualified J as estimated based on poor result precision. Serial Dilution Serial dilutions were not analyzed with these samples. Laboratory Control Sample (LCS) Analysis LCS analyses were within the windows established for each certified parameter, with the exception of results for elements other than arsenic and zinc, on one of the three LCS samples (M8245SL2) analyzed by ICP and GFAA. The recoveries of cadmium, copper, nickel, and lead were - 134%, 126%, 127%, and 127% respectively, on the noted LCS sample. Recovery of phosphorous was also higher from this sample, and phosphorous precision from this sample was poor. Phosphorous level was not certified for the LCS sample. Recoveries on these elements for this sample, were within 20% of the manufacturer's made to value level. Data were not qualified based on the result on one out of three of the LCS samples for ICP and GFAA analysis.Appendix 2-I.
