The individual likely acquired the infection on a recent overseas trip, which is also a reminder to those travelling overseas over the holiday period to make sure they are vaccinated. ACT Health is currently investigating the case and can confirm no further cases linked to this one has been notified to date. As part of our investigations, we are following-up identified contacts in line with national guidelines. The case attended the following public venues while infectious: Monday 10 December 2018 - The UNITE 2018 - Syro Malabar National Youth Conference at Philip Island Adventure Resort, Cowes, VICTORIA Tuesday 11 December 2018 - Tiger Air Flight TT665 from Melbourne (departed 11.30am) to Canberra (landed 12.30pm) - Melbourne Domestic (9am to 12pm) and Canberra Airports (12.30pm to 2pm) Wednesday 12 December 2018 - Spice World, Colbee Court, Phillip ACT (afternoon/evening) Thursday 13 December 2018 - Woolworths, Westfield Woden Shopping Centre, Phillip ACT (morning) People who attended these sites at these times should be aware of symptoms of measles from now until Friday 4 January 2019. These may include fever, tiredness, runny nose, sore eyes and a cough, followed by a rash which appears 2-7 days later. Anyone with symptoms of measles should seek medical advice, advising their health care provider before they arrive so that appropriate infection control precautions can be put in place to stop the spread of the infection. People generally develop symptoms 7-18 days after being exposed to a person with infectious measles, with 10 days being more common. People are infectious from 4 days before they develop a rash until 4 days after. Measles is a serious disease and is highly contagious among people who are not fully immunised. The virus is spread from an infectious person during coughing and sneezing or through direct contact with secretions from the nose or mouth. Whenever a case of measles is identified in our community, it is a strong reminder that the best way to protect yourself and your family against measles is vaccination. Two doses of Measles Mumps Rubella vaccine (MMR) are required for immunity against measles and are given to children in Australia at 12 and 18 months of age. However, the vaccine can be given at any age after 9 months. With many travelling over the holiday period in the next few weeks, we are encouraging people to check their immunisation status and get up to date if needed before travelling.
