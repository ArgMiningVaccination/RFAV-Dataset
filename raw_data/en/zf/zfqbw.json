Our goal is to support people with sensory and/or other accommodation needs in Massachusetts to have the most positive and comfortable vaccination experience possible. We will be hosting a series of disability-friendly vaccination events across Massachusetts. These events will have extra staff on hand to provide skilled support to people with disabilities and/or sensory support needs. Most of these events will be offering COVID vaccinations for children ages 5 and up, as well as adult initial vaccines and boosters. Both people with and without disabilities can get vaccinated - including the whole family ages 5+ or staff that may come supporting people with a disability. [Sites and Dates](https://vaxabilities.wordpress.com/disability-friend-vaccine-events/) Each event has its own sign-up link to reserve an appointment that includes disability supports. These appointments provide extra time and reserve your spot at a designated disability-friendly vaccine station. We encourage you to book an appointment to reserve your preferred time. Walk-ins will be welcome at the sites where noted, as long as capacity allows. To be fully vaccinated, children will need two doses of the vaccine, 3 weeks apart. Tell us what you need: After you book your appointment, please tell us more about any specific support needs you may have [here](https://umassmed.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_dciD029v2AYk8qa) or at the QR Code below. You may also use this link to ask questions. [See what people are saying about our events!](https://vaxabilities.com/?page_id=134) Find us on site! When you come to get vaccinated, look for Levon the Lion and our staff in orange vests. Questions about the vaccine? Most events will have pediatricians present so parents can ask any questions they may have about the COVID vaccine.
