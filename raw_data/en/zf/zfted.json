Our detoxification program includes dietary, oral, and intravenous methods of removing the body burden of inorganic toxins (eg heavy metals) and organic toxins (eg pesticides, solvents, environmental senstivities, etc). Last edited: May 2021 by Eric Chan, ND Combination of Therapies for Detoxification and Treatment of Chronic Fatigue / Myalgic Encephalitis, Fibromyalgia, and Other Chronic Diseases [Chronic fatigue syndrome](/chronic-fatigue-syndrome), or Myalgic Encephalitis, along with [fibromyalgia](/fibromyalgia-treatment) have become an increasingly common condition that is seen in the office. It is often difficult to manage, and most of the conventional approach has been focused on pacing, sleep hygiene, and in some cases symptom management with medications. These are very important components of the treatment but there are some subsets of patients who may do well with [assessment for toxins](/detoxification) and then subsequent reduction. Reducing the toxic burden is another way to \"take a load off the body\" so that homeostatic mechanisms may become more efficient. Toxins can be classified as inorganic (toxic heavy metals and transition metals), organic (pesticides, solvents, cigarette-related toxins), or biological (allergies, low-grade hidden infections). Various toxins may be cleared by the liver detoxification pathways. It is general opinion by Environmental Medicine groups such as the American Academy of Environmental Medicine, that unfortunately these toxins may potentially overload detoxification pathways, potentially aggravating symptoms. Infections may be a toxic foci, which until naturally resolved by the system or treated, may potentially contribute to chronic diseases. The increased burden on the system can be fatiguing in a very general sense and affect the energy envelope available to the patient. Our combination of detoxification therapies is comprehensive in that [toxic metals](/heavy-metals) may be pulled out of the tissues and excreted (intravenous chelation therapy), low-grade [infections](/lyme-disease-test) may be treated, organic toxins can be identified in case there is an increased body burden and addressed, and the liver, kidneys, and lymphatic system may be supported. A temporary low-allergen diet may recommended in patients. Support of liver detoxification comes from recognizing the biochemistry of natural detoxification in this organ. Medical foods and supplements may be used to support Phase I reactions and Phase II liver detoxification pathways. There are also herbal drainage remedies that are commonly used which seem to give additional help. Detoxification can often be broken down into a three-step process when dealing with either heavy metal toxins organic toxins. The 1st is to focus on intracellular mobilization of the toxins: the analogy here is to go through a deep spring cleaning of the house. The 2nd is to focus on excretion of those toxins by mobilization of the lymphatics, kidney and liver support. The analogy can be thought of as making sure that the garbage and recycling pickup is operating so that what is removed in the deep spring cleaning does not simply accumulate elsewhere. The 3rd important component is to ensure that there is no reabsorption of the toxins, which typically happens in the enterohepatic recirculation system between the gut and the liver. This is where fibers, binders can be useful to ensure that toxins stay in the gut and get excreted. Again, and analogy is that we want to make sure that the garbage and recycling does not make its way back to the house after the spring cleaning. In conclusion, detoxification is one of the fundamental ways in which we can support body. We are not speaking of acute toxicity but rather are trying to lower the burden on the body. Stimulation of the body's natural healing ability may involves removing these toxic obstacles to cure; thus detoxification may be indicated. Signs that detoxification may be indicated: feeling worse with exposure to stronger scents aggravation of symptoms with even the slightest departure from a very clean diet onset of symptoms after a more acute chemical or toxin exposure aggravation of symptoms in certain environments such as the workplace or home Evidence for role of infections in Auto-immune diseases, heart disease (only a few of many more): \u00b7Assessment of systemic inflammation and infective pathogen burden in patients with cardiac syndrome X.
