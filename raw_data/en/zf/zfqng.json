Yoga and massage therapy are two popular forms of relaxation and recovery, but a meditation session can hold its ground next to them. Meditation had previously been associated with scholars and religious practice, but during the mid-20th century, it became popular by common people in the United States. Although it's most commonly associated with Hinduism, meditation has been practiced in various religions throughout history. As it became more normalized, more people in the fitness world started using it to help clear their minds, aid in recovery, and improve their well-being. Whether you meditate before or after a workout, it can be beneficial in its own way, but it does call the question if one is better than the other.

Post-workout meditation can help calm your nervous system down, but meditating before your workout can help bring more oxygen to the brain and decrease stress. It can also allow you to clear your mind, bringing you to the present moment, and focus solely on your workout without having external stressors running through your head.

Our nervous system is made up of two systems: the sympathetic and the parasympathetic, and together, they help control our blood pressure, heart rate, and digestion. The sympathetic helps our body react to stress and is also known as fight or flight, but the parasympathetic helps our body recover from stress. If we experience chronic stress and our cortisol levels remain high, it can result in high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease.

You may associate meditation with sitting cross-legged on the ground in silence with your eyes closed and palms together. But meditation is more personalized than that stereotype. There's no right or wrong way to meditate, but if you're a beginner it can be difficult to understand what to do. A few minutes a day is enough to reap the benefits of meditation. Here's a simple guide to get your started: Before hitting the gym, you may get your playlist ready, take some pre-workout, and hop right into your routine. Often people neglect stretching or mobility before their workout, and even more may neglect the benefits of meditation. Taking the time to practice breathing exercises, stretch your muscles, and find the present moment could make all the difference in your workout. Meditating before your workout can help bring more oxygen to your muscles, which is important for performance. Your muscles have to work harder during physical activity, so they demand more oxygen. If you take some time to meditate pre-workout, you may help reduce lactic acid build up, allowing you to have a longer, more intense workout. Meditating prior to working out can also help enhance your focus since your mind is more clear from racing thoughts of work, finances, and other outside stressors that could otherwise inhibit your fitness goals. Be honest. How often do you stretch after your workout? A proper stretch and cool down after a bout of cardio or strength training can help reduce your risk of injury, improve your blood flow, and be beneficial for your overall health. Meditating after your workout can provide similar benefits for your mind and body. Taking a few moments to breathe and clear your mind after an intense workout can help you better solidify your goals and intentions, whether it be weight loss, muscle growth, or well-being. Practicing breathing exercises after hitting the weights can also help reduce your cortisol levels by calming your nervous system and aid in the recovery process. After you exercise, the oxygen in your blood can be deficient, so it needs to be replenished in order to help your muscles recover. Meditating can help bring more oxygen to your muscles, just like it can before a workout, which can help better repair them and reduce your risk of injury. Meditation at any point can be beneficial for your mind and your body, and by incorporating it even just a few minutes a day can help improve your overall physical and mental health. Depending on what your goals are can help determine whether you should take a few minutes before or after the gym to meditate. If the workout is longer, more strenuous, and will require intense focus, such as Olympic lifts, you may consider meditating pre-workout to help clear your mind of distractions. If you're more focused on recovery after a tough leg day and keeping your stress levels low, meditating post-workout may be the better option. There's no one-size fits all when it comes to meditation, and that includes when, where, or how you do it. As long as you take the time to improve your overall well-being, you're on the right track.
