(1)(2) We use the term growth faltering herein. Worldwide, child- hood malnutrition is still a major cause of morbidity andmortality, with 45% of mortality in children younger than5 years linked to undernutrition. (3) In the United States, the epidemiology of growth faltering is dif cult to mea- sure due to lack of uniformity in the populations studiedand the de nitions used. (4)(5) Estimates of prevalence have ranged from less than 2% to greater than 10%, withhigher rates in populations of children in low-incomehouseholds, children with special health-care needs, refu- gee children, and children born at lower birthweight. (6)(7)(8) The traditional organic/nonorganic dichotomyformerly used to classify etiologies is obsolete becausechildhood growth faltering often derives from the interplayof medical, developmental/behavioral, nutritional, and psy- chosocial factors resulting in nutritional de ciency. Growth faltering increases risk in the short term for medical complications of acute infections and chronic conditions, and in the long term for persistent short stature, developmental and psychosocial de cits, and adult conditions such as cardiovascular disease and met-abolic syndrome. (9)(10)(11)(12) Successful treatmentoften requires assessment and intervention in multiface-t e dd o m a i n s .T h i sr e v i e wa i m st oh e l pc l i n i c i a n sn a v i - gate multidisciplinary assessment and treatment of the overlapping medical, developmental/behavioral, nutri-tional, and psychosocial components of growth falteringand undernutrition in children. DEFINITIONS Growth faltering is a descriptive term used to diagnose children whose attained weight for length or BMI is below expected on age- and sex-speci c growth charts, or whose weight on these charts has crossed downward more than2 major percentile lines after having previously achieved astable growth pattern. (5)(13) We have replaced the termfailure to thrive with growth faltering because the latter is more descriptive, less pejorative, and has begun to replace the former term in many US and worldwide publications.(1)(2)(14)(15)(16)(17) Growth faltering results from malnutrition. The de - nition of malnutrition by the World Health Organization(WHO) holistically refers to \"deciencies or excesses in nutrient intake, imbalance of essential nutrients orimpaired nutrient utilization. \"(18) To facilitate the understanding of pediatric nutrition, the American Soci- ety for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) de nes malnutrition as \"imbalance between nutrient require- ments and intake that results in cumulative de cits of energy, protein, or micronutrients that may negatively affect growth, development, and other relevant out- comes. \"To expand this de nition, ASPEN suggests a process-focused scheme that includes \"chronicity, etiol- ogy, and pathogenesis of malnutrition; its relationship with in flammation; and its impact on functional out- comes. \"(11) To classify malnutrition, the Centers for Disease Con- trol and Prevention (CDC) recommends using the WHO standards from birth to age 2 years and the CDC referencecharts from ages 2 to 20 years. (19) Indicators are summa-rized in Table 1. Wasting refers to BMI or weight-for- length zscores (standard deviation units) less than -2 and is a measure of acute malnutrition. Stunting isdened by length or height zscore less than -2 and is the result of chronic malnutrition, in which case weight maybe proportional to height. Low length/height needs to be taken into clinical context because short stature could also be due to familial, genetic, or endocrinologic causes.Using single data points, moderate malnutrition or wast-ing is de ned by attained weight-for-height, BMI, or mid- upper arm circumference zscores between -2 and -3 for moderate malnutrition and less than -3 for severe malnu- trition. When at least 2 data points are available, nutri-tional status may be assessed in dynamic terms by percentage of age-expected weight gain velocity of less than 50% for moderate and less than 25% for severe mal-nutrition compared with WHO standards, or in childrenolder than 2 years percentage weight loss of 7.5% of previ- ous body weight for moderate and 10% for severe, or deceleration in weight-for-length/height zscore of 2 z scores for moderate and 3 zscores for severe. (7) For chil- dren with atypical anatomy or for whom height cannot bemeasured, additional assessment of nutritional status can be performed with measurement of mid-upper arm cir- cumference, arm span, and/or triceps skinfold values (thelatter if the provider has the training and the properequipment). PATHOGENESIS Mechanisms of growth faltering can be understood interms of inadequate energy (caloric) intake, inadequateabsorption, excessive energy expenditure due to 591 Vol. 42 No. 11 NOVEMBER 2021 Downloaded from http://publications.aap.org/pediatricsinreview/article-pdf/42/11/590/1270256/pedsinreview_2020001883.pdf by Stony Brook University, Ashley Saint-Fleur on 04 May 2022underlying health conditions, or defective utilization of energy (occurring in some genetic and metabolic condi-tions). (5) The most common cause of growth faltering, inadequate intake, can be due to insuf cient supply or consumption of food. Inadequate intake in the neonatal period sometimesreflects improper mixing of formula or dif culties with breastfeeding. At all ages, inadequate food supplies in thehousehold precipitate inadequate intake (see the extendeddiscussion of food insecurity later herein). Inadequate con-sumption may occur even when food supplies are suf cient, often secondary to feeding dif culties. Pediatric feeding disorders have been de ned by Goday et al (20) as \"impaired oral intake that is not age- appropriate, and is associated with medical, nutritional,feeding skill, and/or psychosocial dysfunction. \"It is important to recognize that this de nition overlaps sig- nic a n t l yw i t ht h em o r eb e h a v i o r a l l yf o c u s e dd i a g n o s i s of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, especiallywhen working together with psychologists and psychia-trists. This disorder is de ned in the Diagnostic and Sta- tistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, as an eating or feeding disturbance manifested by persistentfailure to meet appropriate nutritional and/or energyneeds associated with undernutrition and/or interfer- ence with Medical, devel- opmental/behavioral, and psychosocial factors oftenoverlap in these cases. (22) Medical evaluation for feeding dif culties and poor intake as causes of growth faltering includes assessmentof aerodigestive causes (such as aspiration), gastrointes-tinal (GI) anatomical or mucosal abnormalities,developmental problems, and excess consumption of unbalanced sources of nutrition (especially milk orjuice). Red flags for aspiration include overt coughing or choking with feeding, congestion with feeding, symp-toms consistent with re flux, or more subtle signs of stress in infants, such as blinking, red/watery eyes,feeding aversion, or chronic or recurrent respiratorysymptoms or infections. However, Duncan et al (23) showed that clinical evaluation has lower sensitivity for detecting aspiration than does modi ed barium swallow (video fluoroscopic swallow study) and concluded that this study should be performed for persistent symp-toms. Evaluation for feeding dif culties should consider GI causes such as eosinophilic esophagitis, re flux, and rare anatomical problems such as esophageal web orstricture. (24) Underlying developmental problems may contribute to feeding dif culty and consequent malnu- trition, which, in turn, may compound the developmentaland medical conditions. (25) Excess cow milk consumptionhas been associated with lower intake of food, although notpoor weight gain, and with iron de ciency anemia that can be severe. (26)(27) Iron and micronutrient de ciencies often (although not always) accompany poor growth andfeeding disorders, and iron and zinc de ciencies suppress appetite. (8)(11)(27)(28)(29) (30) Malabsorption may be secondary to GI pathology, such as celiac disease, in flammatory can present with depressed appetite and malabsorption and should be considered among children who may have had environ-mental exposures.

Obstructive sleep apnea,usually manifested by chronic snoring, can also be associ- ated with growth failure, although the mechanism is not clear. (32) (33)(34) Defective energy utilization encompasses some genetic (such as trisomies 21 and 18) or metabolic (such as abnor- mal glucose metabolism in glycogen storage disease) con- ditions. Genetic or metabolic conditions can also causegrowth problems secondary to medical complications,delayed feeding skills, or elevated risk of celiac disease in the case of trisomy 21 or Turner syndrome. CLINICAL ASPECTS: HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION In evaluating infants and young children with growth falter- ing, it is essential to obtain a meticulous history of thepregnancy and the perinatal period, not only by interviewing caregivers but also by reviewing, if available, the child 's( a n d ideally the mother 's) perinatal records. The medical and social histories of pregnancy and birth status, as well as mid- parental height if available, inform the interpretation of cur- rent anthropometry and risk factors for poor growth. Thereview of systems should be thorough because growth canfalter due to involvement of any of the body systems. It is important to gather detailed feeding and nutritional histories (see Table 2). Family history should speci c a l l yi n c l u d eh i s t o r yo f GI disease, atopy, developmental disorders, and nutri-tional status, along with mental health. Maternal depres- sion may be associated with growth faltering in children; however, evidence in this area is mixed and generallydoes not support an association between maternaldepression and growth faltering in high-resource coun- tries.

GROWTH MEASUREMENT AND USE/ INTERPRETATION OF GROWTH CHARTS Given the importance of growth measurements in evaluat- ing children for growth faltering, obtaining accurate anthropometric measurements is critical. Before 2 years of age, children should be weighed naked or in a clean anddry diaper; older than 2 years, clothing should be light andshoes should be off. A length board (rather than paper and pencil) should be used for children younger than 2 years for length, and a calibrated stadiometer should beused for older children. (38) When using growth curves to assess nutritional status, serial anthropometric measurements should be inter-preted in the context of any previously known growth pat-tern. Evaluation of growth trajectory should consider early on the possibility of \"regression to the mean \"or\"catch- down growth \"especially in large-for -gestational age infants, along with expectations for catch-up growth for infants who were premature and/or small for gestational age (SGA) in the context of parental stature if known.(5)(39)(40) Growth curves should also be interpreted longi-tudinally using both weight and length or height whenever possible to help delineate the processes of wasting and stunting, in which there is usually a decrease in weighttrajectory followed by decreased linear growth, from other nonnutritional causes, such as constitutional delay or genetic or familial short stature. (5)(41) Deceleration inhead circumference is a late sign of severe malnutrition inchildren younger than 2 years or is an indication of a pos- sible syndromic condition. Speci c growth charts also exist for some genetic condi- tions, including trisomy 21, Turner syndrome, or cri-du- chat syndrome; growth should be plotted on these curves for children with these syndromes with the caveat thatthese growth charts may be based on data that includedchildren who were malnourished secondary to medical complications or suboptimal nutritional management of their syndromes. (42)(43) Other markers of nutritional sta-tus should also be used in children with genetic condi- tions, especially weight for length or BMI, and in the future we may have better data on use of other markers ofbody composition. (44)DIAGNOSTIC TESTING In the outpatient setting, diagnostic evaluations in theabsence of ndings on history or physical examination have tended to have a low yield; older studies have been corroborated by newer studies, including those from sub- specialty clinics to which more severe cases may present.(29)(45) The initial presentation, evaluation, and followinggrowth and clinical trajectory should determine the diag-nostic evaluation. If a child presents with minimally poorweight gain and improves after nutritional counseling, detailed laboratory assessment may not be necessary. More severe malnutrition or lack of response to initialcounseling merit more evaluation, depending on the his-tory and physical examination ndings. Evaluation may include the following: complete blood cell count with dif- ferential count for anemia and other rarer abnormalities such as signs of immunode ciency and malignancy; iron studies because iron de ciency is common in children with poor growth; (46) lead; a chemistry panel to assessfor problems such as renal tubular acidosis or to monitorrefeeding syndrome if necessary once nutritional rehabili- tation has started; celiac disease evaluation, including total immunoglobulinA (IgA) and tissue transglutaminase IgAantibodies in children old enough to have been introducedto grains because celiac disease is increasing in prevalenceand can present with growth faltering without other symp- toms; (47) urine tests if there is concern for infection, gly- cosuria, or renal pathology; stool studies for infection ormalabsorption depending on symptoms and travel history;human immunode ciency virus (HIV) testing or other infectious evaluation; and measurement of micronutrients other than iron should be considered only if indicated by the history or physical examination. As recommended by the American Academy of Pediat- rics (AAP) and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology in their \"Choosing Wisely \"campaign, we do not routinely send IgE tests for food allergens unlessspecically indicated by history and/or physical examina- tion ndings. Not only are false-positives common, but negative testing does not rule out food allergy, especiallyin GI disease, which is less likely to be IgE-mediated. (48) Furthermore, in atopic children, food elimination poses potential increased risk for later systemic response andunnecessarily restricted diets, which can further exacer-bate growth faltering. (49)(50) Further highly targeted diagnostic testing dictated by history and physical examination ndings may include a sweat test for cystic brosis, modi ed barium swallow to assess for aspiration, endoscopic evaluation if there is 594 Pediatrics in Review Downloaded from http://publications.aap.org/pediatricsinreview/article-pdf/42/11/590/1270256/pedsinreview_2020001883.pdf by Stony Brook University, Ashley Saint-Fleur on 04 May 2022suspected GI pathology, thyroid function tests if the child has short stature, and head imaging in the rare case of suspicion for intracranial mass/diencephalic syndrome.(51) CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN INFANTS WITH A HISTORY OF PREMATURITY, INTRAUTERINE GROWTH RETARDATION, AND SGA Clinical evaluation should begin by assessing as accurately as possible the child 's gestational age at birth and whether intrauterine growth retardation was identi ed by serial prenatal measurements. Besides intrauterine growth and gestational age, birthweight should be categorized asappropriate for gestational age, SGA ( <10th percentile for gestational or large for gestational age ( >90th per- centile for gestational age). Premature infants, commonly also having intrauterine growth retardation, can alreadyface nutritional de cits at the time of NICU discharge, including having slower gain of weight, length, and head circumference than their gestational-age equivalents. After discharge, complications of prematurity, including chroniclung disease, can cause increased metabolic needs, and feeding dif culties secondary to aspiration, re flux, and/or developmental delays can cause feeding dif culties and insufcient intake. (52) Regardless of gestational age, weight and length at birth reflect both the duration of gestation and the rate of growth during gestation. Infants whose rate of intrauterine growthfor gestational age is depressed are at risk for postnatal growth failure, regardless of gestational age. The degree of risk of postnatal growth failure after SGA can vary dependingon the cause of the SGA; degree of prematurity; contributing socioenvironmental, teratogenic, and genetic factors; and rela- tive degree of de cit in weight, length, and head circumfer- ence at birth. (53) Controversy persists as to the relativeimportance of the symmetrical/asymmetrical differences in SGA growth expectations. (54) SGA infants whose weight, length, and head circumference are proportionatelydepressed at birth (ie, \"symmetrical \") in general carry a rela- tively poorer prognosis for later growth and development and should be evaluated for genetic diagnoses or exposures to intrauterine infections or teratogens. (53)(55) In evaluating growth, several transitions will be made among growth curves. The WHO growth standards were constructed from a cohort that omitted preterm infants,but recent researchers have suggested that after 42 to 50 weeks 'postmenstrual age, former low birthweight infants should be assessed using these sex-speci c WHO stand- ards. Before that age there are several preterm speci cgrowth references, and the Fenton growth chart for pre- term infants can facilitate smooth transition to the WHO standards 4 to 10 weeks after term. (56) Plotting of growthon the WHO standards should be corrected for gestationalage for preterm infants until age 2 to 3 years. (11)(57)(58)(59) For children referred for growth faltering who were SGA at birth, if substantial catch-up growth hasnot occurred by 2 years of age in response to optimalnutrition and care, referral for endocrine consultation for potential growth hormone therapy should be considered (not for de ciency). (53)(55) We lack suf cient evidence for optimal rate of postnatal catch-up growth for infants with low birthweight, whether preterm or SGA, to enhance cognitive outcome while notincreasing long-term cardiovascular risk; however, sus- tained deterioration in growth velocity is always a matter of concern and in the rst year after birth has been linked to suboptimal cognitive performance in the short- andlong-term. (60) Brief postnatal weight loss because of nor- mal extracellular volume loss should be resolved by 21 days after birth, after which time deceleration in weightvelocity zscore should be investigated for remediable social, medical, and nutritional stressors described else- where in this article. CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may have behavioral and sensory dif culties, as well as concurrent GI disorders, which can lead to poor growth. Conversely, growth and feeding dif culties can be a red flag for devel- opmental concerns, including ASD. Children with ASD often struggle with rigid obsessional behaviors, sensory sensitivity, and anxiety around food. (61)(62) Dependingon which foods are accepted, this selectivity can contributeto aberrant weight gain and growth. Children with ASD are at risk for both GI symptoms and feeding dif culties, which can result in growth falter- ing as well as risk for overweight (often still at risk for micronutrient and sometimes macronutrient de ciencies). Children with ASD have approximately 4 times higherodds of GI symptoms than comparison populations, butcommunication barriers often make clinical diagnosis challenging. (63) Children with both ASD and GI symp- toms tend to manifest more severe ASD core symptomsthan others. A review by Marshall et al (64) found that common characteristics of feeding dif culties include restricted dietary variety or limited diet based on texture,food neophobia, and food refusal; both dietary quality and 595 Vol. 42 No. 11 NOVEMBER 2021 Downloaded from http://publications.aap.org/pediatricsinreview/article-pdf/42/11/590/1270256/pedsinreview_2020001883.pdf by Stony Brook University, Ashley Saint-Fleur on 04 May 2022mealtime behaviors were common problems. Some stud- ies did nd children with ASD to be underweight com- pared with controls, but more studies actually found ahigher rate of being overweight. (63) Because these dif - culties can start quite early, clinicians should be alert to the possibility of ASD in young children with severe, per- sistent feeding problems, often associated with growth fal-tering. (61)(64) FETAL ALCOHOL SPECTRUM DISORDER AND OTHER RECREATIONAL PSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCE EXPOSURES The approach to the diagnosis and treatment of a child with prenatal exposures to alcohol and/or recreationalpsychoactive substances whose growth is faltering should be very similar to that used for all children presenting with growth faltering, taking into consideration medical,nutritional, developmental, and social risks. Althoughmany recreational psychoactive substances are associated with reduced infant size at birth, (65) only heavy prenatal alcohol exposure is clearly associated with postnatalgrowth restriction, and only heavy alcohol use is consis- tently associated with cardiac and renal malformations that may contribute to growth failure. (66) History ofprenatal substance exposure does not obviate the needfor appropriate assessment and intervention of growth faltering. Children with prenatal substance exposure in settings in which perinatal HIV screening is not universal should be screened at presentation for growth faltering because growth failure is a hallmark of HIV infection in untreatedchildren. (67) Other vertically transmitted infections asso- ciated with intravenous substance use (eg, syphilis, hepati- tis C) should be considered if a mother or child has hadinadequate medical care before presentation. Nutritional and developmental behavioral factors should also be assessed. Iron de ciency anemia has been described in infants exposed prenatally to a mother 's binge alcohol use and has been found to be independently associated with reduced postnatal growth particularly among infants with dysmorphic features classic for fetalalcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). (68) Delayed feedingskills and aberrant feeding behaviors have also been noted in children with FASD. (69) As in all cases of growth fal- tering, assessment should be performed for parental dis-tress, family violence, and inadequacy of basic care provided to the child. These factors are of particular con- cern in families with untreated alcohol and other sub-stance use disorders. (70)Although attained growth in children with FASD can be less than the 10th percentile, even with dietary and other interventions, the trajectory of growth should be atleast appropriate for age, with weight and length/heightproportionate. (71) Elevated BMI may be seen in adoles- cents with FASD, so nutritional interventions should be carefully titrated. (72) CHILD PROTECTION CONSIDERATIONS IN GROWTH FALTERING AND INDICATIONS FORHOSPITALIZATION Given clinician subjectivity and varying state legal criteria for diagnosing \"neglect\" above and beyond a family's inability to meet children's needs due to economic depri-vation, neglect is not a valid diagnosis of exclusion incases of growth faltering. It is also important to note that an inability of parents to provide children with adequate nutrition as a result of poverty should not be con flated with child neglect or abuse. (73) Child abuse, including medical child abuse or food withholding, is a rare proximate cause of growth faltering. (74)(75)(76) Other clinical concerns that may necessitatethe involvement of child protective services in the treat-ment of growth faltering, as in other pediatric diseases, include situations in which caregivers cannot provide or sustain needed outpatient interventions for their childrenbecause of profound cognitive disability, untreated severepsychiatric illness, or substance use disorders. (73)(77) Evi- dence is insuf cient regarding whether infant or child exposure to intimate partner violence among caregivers isassociated with poor growth. (78) Although hospitalization is indicated if the severity of medical conditions or malnutrition warrants it, hospitali-zation for the purposes of comparing pre-admissionweight gain with in-hospital weight gain should not be used as a diagnostic method to determine whether growth faltering is of an \"organic \"or\"inorganic \"etiology. Al- though one prospective study of children hospitalized forgrowth faltering found that most children displayed improved weight gain after receiving behavioral interven- tions alone, in-hospital weight gain has not been found tobe speci c for differentiating neglect from other etiologies. (79)(80) T H ER O L EO FS O C I A LD E T E R M I N A N T SO F HEALTH IN GROWTH FALTERING Social determinants of health, de ned as the conditions in which people are born, live, grow, and age, are often signi - cant factors in undernutrition and growth faltering. (81)(82) 596 Pediatrics in Review Downloaded from http://publications.aap.org/pediatricsinreview/article-pdf/42/11/590/1270256/pedsinreview_2020001883.pdf by Stony Brook University, Ashley Saint-Fleur on 04 May 2022Social determinants of health include food insecurity, housing instability, and energy insecurity, all of which can be viewed as downstream effects of poverty, structural rac-ism, and general nancial strain. Poverty itself, mediated through these factors and others, including pervasive family stress, may be a risk factor for poor growth in children. Data from the 2009 Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance Studydemonstrate that children who qualify for federal nutrition assistance because of low family income are more likely to be of short stature than those who do not qualify. (6) Food insecurity can be de ned as the limited or uncer- tain ability to obtain nutritionally adequate and safe foods in a socially acceptable manner. (83) In 2018, 11.1% of UShouseholds, in which 11.2 million children resided, experi-enced food insecurity for some part of the year; the rate of food insecurity was higher in households with young chil- dren than in those that did not include children, particu-larly in nonwhite households. (84) Historically, the prevalence of food insecurity increases during times of economic recession. Other social determinants predisposing to growth fal- tering include energy insecurity, which can be de ned as an inability to afford energy to ful ll basic needs, and housing instability. Parents often decrease food expendi-tures by the same amount that they have to increase energy expenditures during colder months; for families who already experience food insecurity, further divertingmoney away from food purchases could potentially lead toundernutrition in children. (85) Housing instability has been associated with lower weight-for-age zscores, and maternal homelessness during pregnancy is a risk factorfor low birthweight, which is associated with growth falter- ing during childhood. (55)(86)(87)(88)(89)(90)(91) The effective treatment of growth faltering often requires that these underlying social determinants and unmet material needs be uncovered and addressed. Detecting underlying unmet needs may be accomplishedusing validated screening tools, as recommended by theAAP. (92) These tools can be designed to screen for a wide range of needs at once, as in the WE CARE model, or can be geared toward a speci c social need, such as food insecurity, as is the case with the Hunger Vital Sign. (81)(93) The speci c method of screening used should be tailored to the demographics and developmental stage ofthe target population, and screening should ideally beginonly once appropriate resources are identi ed and referral mechanisms are in place. (94) Compiling a list of local resources for families can be accomplished using onlinedirectories, such as Aunt Bertha \u00a9or One Degree \u00a9,o determinants of health is asso- ciated with improved growth outcomes. State- and national-level nutrition assistance programs for low-income families include the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly Food Stamps), the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,Infants, and Children (WIC), and school meals programs (National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program). Participation in SNAP and/or WIC has been found to be associated with lower risk of growth faltering and micronutrient de ciencies. (97) The nutritional ben- ets of WIC participation can begin as early as the pre- natal period with decreased risk of low birthweight and other adverse perinatal outcomes, potentially reducing risk of growth faltering in the future. (98)(99)(100)(101) Participation in SNAP decreases food insecurity and hasbeen positively associated with birthweight and weight status in children. (102)(103)(104)(105) Fuel assistance and housing subsidies are associated on a population level with improved growth in infants and young children. Participation in the Low IncomeHome Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), a national program that can be used by eligible families to assist with paying for energy bills, has been found to be asso- ciated with decreased risk of growth problems in chil- dren, likely by reducing overall n a n c i a ls t r a i ni nl o w - income families. (106) Housing subsidies have also been associated with decreased risk of childhood under- weight status. (107) Although policy varies by state, eligibility criteria for programs are sometimes linked. (108) Therefore, any pol-icy changes that restrict access to one program can have a ripple effect that also causes children to lose access to other sources of nutritional assistance. Recently, children in families with immigrant members are in increased jeopardy of nutritional deprivation because perceivedthreats to parents ' immigration status if they participate in public programs have a \"chilling effect \"on program par- ticipation even for children and other family memberswho may be eligible. (109) Another \"critical and often overlooked social determi- nant \"is climate change, which leads to food, water, and nutrient insecurity. (110)(111) Climate change is associated with increased infectious disease, natural disasters, andmigration, all of which affect child growth and access to food. Climate change also in fluences both the quality and quantity of food being produced. (112)(113)(114) In clinical 597 Vol. 42 No. 11 NOVEMBER 2021 Downloaded from http://publications.aap.org/pediatricsinreview/article-pdf/42/11/590/1270256/pedsinreview_2020001883.pdf by Stony Brook University, Ashley Saint-Fleur on 04 May 2022practice, the AAP recommends discussion of climate change during clinical visits, explaining the linkbetween climate change and poor growth is anotherway that providers can empower parents/families with information to be able to advocate for themselves. Fur- thermore, pediatricians can help with education ondisaster preparedness and can provide referrals as dis-cussed previously herein (and in speci c settings for disaster relief) for affected families for whom othersocial determinants are exacerbated by the effects of cli-mate change. (110)(115) CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS IN TREATMENT OF GROWTH FALTERING In our increasingly diverse societies, cultural food practi- ces should always be considered in constructing effectivenutritional evaluation and recommendations for any childwith feeding dif culties and growth faltering. This is espe- cially true for recent immigrants who are adapting fromone food culture to another, sometimes in the context ofconstrained nancial resources. Cultural beliefs and practices in fluence how parents and caregivers perceive their children 's weight, and this perception may in fluence the family 's response to dietary recommendations given by health providers who may notshare these perceptions. In some cultures a \"chubby baby \" demonstrates a family 's ability to afford suf cient food for their child. (116) Other families who have experienced per-vasive deprivation and seen children die of malnutrition intheir home country or refugee camp may feel that a childwho is able to be physically active is doing well enoughoverall and that the health professional 's concern that the child is underweight is excessive. Cultural variations in feeding practices in fluence which foods are offered and when they are introduced in an infant/toddler's diet. Food practices that may have been bene cial in their original environment can now contribute to causingnutritional de ciencies in the Western world. For example, a family coming from a sunny warm climate can be at higherrisk for rickets without any diet adjustment for vitamin D inthe northern hemisphere. (117) There is also wide cultural variation in the expected emergence of feeding skills, including weaning from bot-tle or breast, nger feeding, and self-feeding. Some cul- tures are reluctant to permit self-feeding until a child canuse utensils, which may impair the independent feedingexpected of young children in child care and other settingsin the United States.In working with diverse families, cultural dietary practices and beliefs are important to ascertain during an evaluation, especially for groups transitioning to a new culture. In our recommendations to encourage healthy eating and weight, health professionals must be mindful to provide culturally sensitive options to prevent the parent from feeling criti- cized, which can further exacerbate tension around mealtime and tension between the family and the provider. It is impor- tant to acknowledge that most traditional non-Western diets (assuming that a variety of foods is available) promote health better than the typical Western diet, which is high in satu- rated fat, sugars, and meat and de cient in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. The goal is not to convert parents from other cultures to a Western diet but to help them adapt their traditional practices and available and preferred foods tomeet the child 's current nutritional needs. WIC has devel- oped different culturally appropriate food packages and cre- ated resources for culturally diverse families to meet children's nutritional needs and can counsel families in their adjustment to this new setting from the perspective of diet and food availability. (118) TREATMENT AND PROGNOSIS Globally and in the United States, as emphasized by the AAP Committee on Nutrition, optimizing nutrition and growth from the prenatal period through approximately age 2 years is considered the most critical time not only in minimizing nutrition-related mortality risks but also in optimizing long-term outcomes in stature, cognition, and noncommunicable disease. (9)(119)(120) Nutritional inter- ventions have consequences for health outcomes and socioeconomic implications throughout the life cycle and for the next generation. (121)(122) From a nutritional perspective, sparse data exist regarding optimal pace of recovery; generally, we aim for sustained expected velocity of weight gain for age without prescribed supplements after a child has attained weight/length or BMI in the -2t o -1zscore range. The goal is to help children reach their potential for linear growth, immune function, bone health, and cognitive and academic outcomes. At the same time, the clinician should remain mindful of avoiding excess weight gain while promoting healthful dietary choices to potentially ameliorate the risk of conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes associated withearly malnutrition. (10)(13)(123) In infants, nutritional management starts with a lacta- tion consult for breastfeeding infants and formula supple- mentation when indicated with the aim of increasing 598 Pediatrics in Review Downloaded from http://publications.aap.org/pediatricsinreview/article-pdf/42/11/590/1270256/pedsinreview_2020001883.pdf by Stony Brook University, Ashley Saint-Fleur on 04 May 2022feeding volume if possible and then caloric density of for- mula or expressed human milk if needed, while keeping in mind free water requirements. In older infants, solids can also be forti ed with the addition of powdered for- mula or oil. For toddlers and children, we focus onincreasing calories using calorically dense foods such asoils, avocado, heavy cream, and peanut butter while avoid-ing foods with low nutritional value such as sweets and fried foods. We often recommend decreasing intake of juice and eliminating other sugar-sweetened beverages,which have minimal nutrient value and may suppressappetite. (124) When needed, supplements, includinghigh-calorie supplemental beverages and multivitamins, can be considered to help children meet micronutrient and macronutrient needs. These supplemental beveragesshould be prescribed with counseling on ideal use andscheduling so that these beverages are not used in place offood and do not exacerbate feeding dif culties. From a behavioral perspective, the treatment of feeding disorders in children is focused on parental educationaround structured mealtimes, which includes setting limitsand boundaries, in a consistent and positive environment.This structure includes avoidance of grazing (includingliquids other than water), which can suppress appetite at mealtime, and limiting mealtime to usually 20 to 30 minutes to avoid child and family stress. Feeding is morelikely to progress in a consistently positive environmentwithout force feeding (including distracting with toys orscreens), which can worsen aversion in the long-term, and without caregivers becoming a \"short order cook \"or reward- ing refusal by providing preferred foods after the food servedis rejected. Common behavioral tips include letting childrenget messy with food for the sensory experience, encouragingself-feeding, and providing positive feedback for desiredbehaviors. Caregiver modeling by eating the desired foods, showing chewing if needed, and generally trying to make meals social and enjoyable is often emphasized. Ellyn Satter 's\"division of responsibility \"is a common (but not well-studied) approach in which parents aretasked with providing the food (or breast or bottle in the case of infants) and the child is responsible for whether to eat and how much. (125) Marshall et al (126) found thatboth systematic desensitization (bottom-up, play-based,modeling style) and operant conditioning (top-down,prompt-and-reward style), when combined with parent education, signi cantly improved dietary variety and qual- ity and in feeding behaviors in children with ASD as wellas those without medical complexity.Without evaluation and treatment of medical factors for undernutrition, nutritional rehabilitation and feedingtherapy in isolation are likely to have suboptimal out- comes. A common underlying medical problem espe- cially in infancy is aspiration, which can usually bemanaged with thickening of milk or adjusting nippleflow rate and positioning. GI pathology causing discom- fort, such as eosinophilic esophagitis or celiac disease,must be diagnosed and treated, and constipation man-agement is often an important component of medicaltreatment. Referral to otolaryngology is appropriate ifsleep apnea is a concern or if tonsillar hypertrophy ismaking swallowing dif cult. In children with medical complexity, collaboration with other specialists is key toaddressing underlying causes of increased metabolicdemand and/or feeding dif culties. Except for vitamin and mineral supplementation in case of de cits, the role of pharmacologic intervention is limited. There is no evidence for treating growth falteringwith acid suppression. Cyproheptadine is relatively safeand effective in the short-term (not studied long-term)even in young children for increasing oral intake, acceler-ating weight gain, and improving mealtime behavior. (127)(128)(129) Its mechanism is antiserotoninergic and antihistaminergic, with the most common adverse effectof somnolence but less common adverse effects of excita-tion or other behavioral changes. (130) In clinical prac-tice, we usually start with nonpharmacologic treatment,b u td e p e n d i n go nac h i l d 'sp r o g r e s sa sw e l la sd e g r e eo f impairment and family stress, cyproheptadine can behelpful in expediting weight gain as well as feedingimprovements. Once improvements are underway, chil-dren and their families can more easily undertake theincremental work of continued nutritional and feedingmanagement. Early referral for multidisciplinary support can help reduce the severity of malnutrition and feeding dif cul- ties and of caregiver stress and long-term impairments. (131)(132) Developmentaland psychosocial interventions should be institutedpromptly, while medical evaluation and nutritionalinterventions are being implemented. For severe, com-plicated, or persistent cases of growth faltering, multi-disciplinary care has been shown to decrease caregiver stress, to improve child mealtime behaviors, and to advance caloric intake and weight gain. (133)(134)Depending on the nature of the feeding dif culty, speech and language pathologists are critical to co-man-age children who aspirate, and speech and language 599 Vol. 42 No. 11 NOVEMBER 2021 Downloaded from http://publications.aap.org/pediatricsinreview/article-pdf/42/11/590/1270256/pedsinreview_2020001883.pdf by Stony Brook University, Ashley Saint-Fleur on 04 May 2022pathologists, occupational therapists, and/or psycholo- gists can be greatly helpful in working around sensory-based and behavioral dif culties and other developmen- tal delays. Collaboration with developmental, communi- c a t i o n ,a n d ,i nc h i l d r e nw i t hA S D ,a p p l i e db e h a v i o r analysis specialists is often also key. Black et al showedthat a home visiting program combined with clinicalintervention for early growth faltering resulted in fewerteacher-reported internalizing problems and better work habits at age 8 years compared with children who received only medical/nutritional intervention. (135)Referral to early intervention, Head Start, and special-ized services in public schools may be helpful. Socialwork support is extremely helpful in connecting patients and families to these supports along with addressing family stressors and resource needs. Successful treatment of growth faltering requires more frequent extended contact than is recommended in the traditional primary care schedule, with degree ofmalnutrition, disordered feeding, and/or other comor-bidities determining the frequency of visits. If multidis-ciplinary care is geographically accessible and primary care of ce-based interventions have not improved the child 's status over several months, referral might be indicated. In more isolated settings, clinicians may con-sider mobilizing local early intervention, social service, and nutritional providers into an ad hoc team ideally with frequent telephone coordination. A collaborativeand culturally competent approach supports opportuni-ties for children and their families to thrive. Summary \u0081By consensus, growth faltering is a descriptive term for below-expected weight for age, weightfor length, or BMI for age or depressed rate ofgrowth for age. (5)(13) \u0081Malnutrition is de ned as per the World Health Organization and the American Society forParenteral and Enteral Nutrition, with moderatemalnutrition de ned as a weight-for-length or BMI zscore less than -2 and severe malnutrition with these parameters as less than -3, or by degree of weight loss or growth deceleration asdescribed previously herein. (11)(18) \u0081The pathogenesis of growth faltering can be due to inadequate energy intake, inadequateabsorption, excessive energy expenditure, ordefective utilization of energy. (5)\u0081Based on expert opinion (evidence quality D), clinical evaluation starts with thorough prenataland perinatal history and includes completemedical history, family history, nutritional andfeeding history, developmental history, and socialhistory. \u0081Although the optimal rate of growth for children with a history of low birthweight is not known, expert opinion and some research evidence(evidence quality C) is that they should showweight and height within normal limits on growthcharts by 2 to 3 years of age without correctionfor gestational age. (11) \u0081Based primarily on consensus due to scant data (evidence quality D), targeted laboratory testingto consider depending on clinical history and severity of nutritional status includes complete blood cell count with or without iron studies,chemistry studies, celiac disease serologies, andother tests as indicated based on history andphysical examination ndings. \u0081Based on some research evidence and expert opinion (evidence quality D), food insecurity alongwith energy and housing insecurity, andaccompanying stressors, may contribute to poor growth and poor diet. Climate change is another social determinant of which emerging awareness isbecoming important. As such, clinicians shouldscreen for underlying social determinants of healthusing validated tools as per American Academy ofPediatrics guidelines and know resources andprograms to which to refer families, along with beinginformed about advocacy efforts for children. (92) \u0081Based on expert opinion (evidence quality D), cultural competency is essential in counseling families regarding growth, feeding and nutrition. \u0081Based primarily on expert opinion (evidence quality D), the goal of treatment is sustainedexpected velocity of weight gain for age withoutprescribed supplements after a child has attainedweight/length or BMI in the -2t o -1zscore range. \u0081Some research evidence, including the results of a systematic review of randomized trials and retrospective studies (evidence quality B),supports cyproheptadine as a pharmacologic toolfor weight gain in children.
