Jackson Women's Health Organization case, [which overturned Roe v. Wade.](https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/supreme-court-overturns-roe-v-wade-in-landmark-opinion) \"This is the most consequential Supreme Court decision in decades. It changes the status of American women as citizens of the United States and as citizens of their states. That's the big picture, but let's not mince words. Women will die because of this ruling,\" Moran said. Moran also said doctors would now consider the local authorities in making decisions with regard to a \"medically necessary\" abortion. \"In 11 states including Texas and Florida, state governments can seize control of the bodies of women who have been raped or who are victims of incest and compel them to carry the baby, child of their rapist to term. This is a different world for women in America,\" he said. [REPUBLICANS REJOICE, DEMOCRATS RAGE AFTER SUPREME COURT OVERTURNS ROE V. WADE](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-rejoice-democrats-rage-supreme-court-overturns-roe-v-wade) Host Martha Raddatz also asked ABC's Dan Abrams about Justice Clarence Thomas's concurring opinion. \"The court went to great lengths to suggest it doesn't apply to any of those other areas, but when you read Justice Thomas' concurrence, it's difficult not to ask the question, what could be next? He puts it all there on the table, Justice Thomas, and while as a practical manner it seems the court doesn't have the votes to overturn in any of those other areas. Analytically, if you read the reasoning of the court, it's hard not to say that Justice Thomas' assessment is more intellectually consistent,\" Abrams said. ABC News White House correspondent Cecilia Vega said that the ruling was somewhat overshadowing [President Biden's meeting with G7 leaders](https://www.foxnews.com/world/biden-g-7-ban-russian-gold-imports-war-ukraine) in Germany. She said that the president had his reaction speech written already prior to the court's decision to overturn Roe v.
