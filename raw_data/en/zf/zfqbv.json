However, there are many concerns on the future of a career in medicine if mental health conditions are reported. See [this article](https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/doctors-forgo-mental-health-care-during-pandemic-over-concerns-about-licensing-stigma) that answers many of your questions related to mental health reporting.
