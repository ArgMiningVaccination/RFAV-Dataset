Some of us are successful using conventional methods, some need a practitioner to facilitate the process, and some may need tools or practices to connect who they think they are with who they are designed to be. Most if not all of us need some outside guidance to help us observe and understand our 'stuck places'. Health requires the unimpeded flow of energy, of Life within and through us in body, mind and spirit. The keynote of health is the freedom to express our uniqueness. Nancy has the capacity to clearly discern both the \"problem\" and the \"potential\" in her clients. She deeply understands the nature of suffering and the power of homeopathy, attunement and loving kindness to restore well-being. Nancy L. Frederick Classical Homeopathy, Attunement Location: Online via Video + Phone Nancy offers homeopathic care, Attunement, and Human Design consultations both online and by phone. These three pillars of healing provide a foundation for body, mind and spirit to integrate and strengthen over time. This work is individualized, dynamic and evolves naturally as circumstances change. There may be periods when more frequent visits are necessary, as well as relative infrequency as deeper changes emerge and become established. Nancy's three decades of practice give her a capacity for serving those with chronic and deep-seated conditions. Through her guidance, she empowers others to utilize the innate healing capacity of the human body to help themselves.
