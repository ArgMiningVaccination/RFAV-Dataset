Kidder : Under section 1115 of the Social Security Act ( \"the Act \"), the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) may approve any experimental, pilot, or demonstration project that, in the judgment of the Secretary, is likely to assist in promoting the objectives of certain Act programs, including Medicaid. Congress enacted section 1115 of the Act to ensure that federal requirements did not \"stand in the way of experimental projects designed to test out new ideas and ways of dealing with the problems of public welfare recipients.\" S. Rep. No. 87- 1589, at 19 (1962), as reprinted in 1962 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1943, 1961. As relevant here, section 1115(a)(1) of the Act a llows the Secretary to waive com pliance with the Medicaid pr ogram requirements of section 1902 of the Act, to the extent and for the period he fi nds necessary to carry out the demonstration project. In addition , section 1115(a)(2) of the Act allows the Secretary to provide federal financial participation (FFP) for demonstration costs that would not otherwise be considered as federally matchable expenditures under section 1903 of the Act, to the extent and for the period prescribed by the Secretary. For the reasons discussed below, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is approving Florida's request to extend its section 1115( a) demonstration titled \" Managed Medical Assistance\" (MMA) (Project Number 11- W-00331/3) effective as of the date of this letter . All current waivers and expenditure authorities in the demonstration will be extended until June 30, 2030, with the exception of the behavioral health and s upportive housing a ssistance pilot, which will be extended until June 30, 2025. CMS's approval of this section 1115(a) demonstration extension is subject to the limitations specified in the attached waivers, expenditure authorit ies, Special Terms and Conditions ( STCs), and any suppl emental attachments defining the nature, character, and extent of federal involvement in this demonstration project. As detailed in the demonstration's STCs, all state plan requirements apply, regardless of whether the services themselves are authorized under the state plan, unless a requirement is specifically identified as waived or not applicable. The state may deviate from Medicaid state plan requirements only to the extent those requirements have been specifically listed as waived or not applicable under the demonstration. Page 2 - Ms. Beth Kidder Objectives of the Medicaid Program As noted above, the Secretary may approve a demonstration project under section 1115 of the Act if, in his judgment, the demonstration is likely to assist in promoting the objectives of title XIX. Under section 1901 of the Act, the Medicaid program provides federal funding to participating states, \"[f]or the purpose of enabling each State, as far as practicable under the conditions in such State, to furnish (1) medical assistance on behalf of fam ilies with dependent children and of aged, blind, or disabled individuals, whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services, and (2) rehabilitation and other services to help such families and individuals attain o r retain capability for independence or self -care.\" Act \u00a7 1901. As this statutory text makes clear, two Medicaid objectives are to enable states to \"furnish ... medical assistance\" - i.e., healthcare services - to certain vulnerable populations and to furni sh those populations with rehabilitation and other services to help them \"attain or retain capability for independence or self -care.\" Section 1901 of the Act. Section 1115 demonstration projects also provide an opportunity for states to test policies that ensure the fiscal sustainability of the Medicaid program, better \"enabling each [s]tate, as far as practicable under the conditions in such [s]tate\", to furnish medical assistance, Act \u00a7 1901, while making it more practicable for states to furnish medical assistance to a broader range of persons in need. We are committed to supporting states that seek to test measures that are likely to increase coverage, improve the health of beneficiaries, and support the fiscal sustainability of states' Medicaid programs. We expect that such demonstration policies will improve beneficiaries' physical and mental health, resulting in these beneficiaries consuming fewer health care services and resources while they are enrolled in Medicaid, which will preserve Medicaid pr ogram resources, make the Medicaid program more efficient, and potentially reduce the program's national average total annual cost per beneficiary of $7871.1 Such measures can promote the objectives of the Medicaid statute by enabling states to make improvements and investments \"as far as practicable under the conditions in such state[s],\" the Act Section 1901, in the broader Medicaid program. These measures m ay enable states to stretch their resources further and enhance their ability to provide medical assistance to a broader range of persons in need, including by expanding the services and populations they cover.2 By the same token, such measures may also p reserve states' ability to continue to provide the optional services and coverage they already have in place. To the extent that either or both of these trends results in lower costs for the state over the long -term, it may allow the state to maintain the long -term fiscal sustainability of its Medicaid program and provide medical services to more Medicaid beneficiaries. 1 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2018 Actuarial Report on the Financial Outlook for Medicaid. 2 States have considerable flexibility in the design of their Medicaid programs, within federal guidelines. Certain benefits are mandatory under federal law, but many benefits may be provided at state option, such as prescription drug benefits, vision benefits, and dental benefits. Similarly, states have considerable latitude to determine whom their Medicaid programs will cover. Certain eligibility groups must be covered under a state's program, but many states opt to cover additional eligibility groups that are optio nal under the Medicaid statute. In addition to expanding Medicaid coverage by covering optional eligibility groups and benefits beyond what the Medicaid statute requires, many states also choose to cover benefits beyond what is authorized by statute by us ing expenditure authority under section 1115(a)(2) of the Act. For example, recently, many states have been relying on this authority to expand the scope of services they offer to address substance use disorders (SUDs) beyond what the statute explicitly a uthorizes. Page 3 - Ms. Beth Kidder Background of Demonstration Parameters The initial Florida Medicaid Reform Demonstration was approved in June 2006, and its name was later changed to MMA. In its current form, the MMA demonstration was approved in June 2014 and was fully implemented throughout the state by August 2014. Florida's current 1115 demonstration allows the state to operate a comprehensive Med icaid managed care program and a Prepaid Ambulatory Health Plan (PAHP). Under the demonstration, most Medicaid- eligible indivi duals are required to enroll in one of the MMA managed care plans contracted with the state under the MMA p rogram. The demonstrat ion also establishes a Low Income Pool (LIP) to ensure continuing support for the safety net providers that furnish uncompensated care to uninsured populations. LIP payments may be used by eligible providers to offset the uncompensated costs of treating t he uninsured, but this expenditure authority does not make uninsured patients eligible for any benefits under the demonstration. The renewal approved in August 2017 allowed the state to continue operating the MMA program while increasing the LIP to $1.5 billion annually through June 30, 2022. On November 30, 2018, CMS approved an amendment to the demonstration that allow ed the state to operate a statewide Prepaid Dental Health Program, modified the LIP to add Regional Perinatal Intensive Care Centers as an eligible hospital ownership subgroup and community behavioral health providers as a participating provider group, and waive d retroactive eligibility for all beneficiaries under the demonstration, except for pregnant women (or during the 60- day period be ginning on the last day of the pregnancy), infants under one year of age, or individuals under age 21. On March 26, 2019, CMS approved an amendment to the demonstration to implement a pilot program that provides additional behavioral health services and supportive housing assistance services for persons aged 21 and older with serious mental illness (SMI), substance use disorder (SUD) or SMI with co -occurring SUD, who are homeless or at risk of homelessness due to their disability. The pilot program is operated in two regions of the s tate: Regions 5 (Pasco and Pinellas counties) and Region 7 (Brevard, Orange, Osceola and Seminole counties ). On February 18, 2020, an amendment to the demonstration was approved that enables Florida to increase the behavioral health and supportive housing assistance pilot's annual enrollment limit, modif ied the LIP 's permissible expenditures related to Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) and Rural Health Clinics (RHC) and memorialize d some budget neutrality -related edits to the behavioral health and supportive housing assistance p ilot table in the STCs . Demonst ration Results Among initial promising findings, the state has reported improved quality -of-care outcomes (e.g., an increase in the trend of the percentage of beneficiaries with controlled high blood pressure, and a decrease in the mental health re -admission rate) from July 2016 through June 2018, as well as strong plan satisfaction rates in 2018 and 2019. Further, plan s elf-selection rates decreased from July 2015 through June 2019, which may be partially attributable to an improvement in the state's algorithm to appropriately place enrollees in plans that meet their Page 4 - Ms. Beth Kidder needs .3 In addition, the overall Healthy Behaviors program completion rates increased by approximately 40 percent from July 2018 through June 2020.4 The se findings should, however, be interpreted with caution, as the se are based on quantitative descriptive analyses without statistical significance testing. Not all of the demonstration's policy components have been implemented long enough to produce meaningful results. The state is expected to provide CMS with more robust findings in its upcoming Summative Evaluation Report which is due to CMS on June 30, 2022.5 In alignment with the CMS -approved E valuation D esign , which is applicable for the demonstration period covering July 1, 2017 through December 31, 2020, t he summative evaluation is expected to include a review of payments under the LIP program, an examination of the waiver of retroactive eligibility and an assessment of the b ehavioral health and supportive housing assistance pilot program, as well as rigorous evaluations of the other demonstration polic y components .6 Extent and Scope of the Demonstration Extension With this extension approval, the STCs have been updated to comport with the 10- year approval timeframe, align with requirements in current state legislation, and improve oversight of the demonstration, among other changes . These updates include: Clarifying budget neutrality rebasing will occur in demonstration year DY17 and DY 22; Clarifying the following LIP requirements : o Resizing the LIP in DY17 and DY22 to align with the budget neutrality rebasing years ; o Aligning the date of LIP reconciliation7\u2014a process by which the state performs a review of all expenditures claimed by providers to determine whether reported costs comport with the LIP's guardrails f or reimbursement \u2014with the timing of an independent certified Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) audit that is required under 42 CFR \u00a7 455.304. The purpose of this alignment is to ensure that DSH payment s are correctly allocated i n the LIP reconciliation ; o Requiring more frequent periodic monitoring calls to strengthen oversight around the LIP ;8 o Adding the state legislative requirement that essential providers \u2014defined as being a part of faculty plans for Florida medical schools and hospitals licensed as 3 See the demonstration 's extension application, available at https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/section -1115- demo/demonstration- and-waiver -list/81311 . 4 Annual Monitoring Report for the Florida Section 1115 Demonstration. CMS is in the process of reviewing this Monitoring Report and once approved, it will be made available on Medicaid.gov. 5 The state also expects to share its preliminary data on the waiver of retroactive eligibility by May 2021. 6 The CMS -approved Evaluation Design is available at : https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/section -1115- demo/demonstration- and-waiver -list/81311 . 7 The CMS Report, August 2019: https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region4/41704058.pdf Page 5 - Ms. Beth Kidder specialty children's hospital s - must contract with each managed care plan in the state, or make a good faith effort to do so, in order to be eligible for LIP funding; Adding needs -based criteria for populations for which services under the behavioral health and supportive housing assistance pilot may be appropriate ; Extending the behavioral health and supportive housing assistance pilot through June 30, 2025; and Updating evaluation requirements for the waiver of retroactive eligibility , including a revised Evaluation Design and a Monitoring Protocol , which describes the metrics the state will report quarterly and annually throughout the demonstration extension period. With this approval, CMS will be providing a longer approval period for the state to test the existing features of the demonstration, including its approach for continuing operations of a comprehensive Medicaid managed care program and a PAHP . This longer approval timeframe will also allow the state to test its approach in providing support for the safety net providers that furnish uncompensated care to uninsured populations . It also provid es a more stable source of funding for these safety -net providers while support ing them in their continued efforts to provide care for uninsured F loridians . Further, the longer timeframe will continue supporting the state 's ability to increase access to services through RHC s and FQHC s. LIP payments may be used by eligible providers to offset the uncompensated costs of treating the uninsured but this expenditure authority does not make uninsured patients eligible for any benefits under the demonstration. The extension will also enable the state to conduct a robust evaluation of the demonstration, including the waiver of retroactive eligibility , as further described below. Monitoring and Evaluation The monitoring and evaluation activities under Florida's MMA demonstration extension will focus on assessing the performance of the demonstration and whether the demonstration is effective in achi eving the objectives of the program. Throughout the life -cycle of the demonstration extension period, monitoring will support tracking the state's progress towards its demonstration goals. The evaluation will focus on studying whether the demonstration policies, such as the managed care p rovisions , customized benefit plans , healthy behaviors program, waiver of retroactive eligibility , the LIP funding , and the behavioral health and supportive housing assistance pilot are effective in producing the desired outcomes for beneficiaries , providers and the Medicaid program overall. The extension of MMA will require Florida to conduct robust monitoring of the demonstration policies, including reporting on enrollment and enrol lment changes over time, access to care, quality of care and health outcomes. As detailed in the STCs , the state will be reporting on CMS's standard metrics for the waiver of retroactive eligibility and incentives for health y behavior s. This requirement of structured monitoring using CMS -specified metrics for these policy areas is an enhancement to the MMA demonstration 's STCs. The performance metrics will also reflect all other components of the state's demonstration. Consistent with CMS requirements fo r all section 1115 demonstrations, the state will undertake rigorous evaluation of the demonstration policies during this extension period. The state is required to prepare a rigorous Evaluation D esign for the entirety of the demonstration approval Page 6 - Ms. Beth Kidder period that is subject to CMS approval, and conduct \u2014in alignment with the E valuation D esign - three Interim E valuation Report s and one S ummative E valuation Report pertaining to the demonstration extension period. The key provisions under the demonstration will be tested via hypotheses and research questions in the state 's approved E valuation D esign. In assessing the extent to which the demonstration achiev es the key policy outcomes and objectives, the state must identify, through robust statistical methods , viable in- state or out -of-state comparison populations, or use other rigorous methodological approaches, such that the impact of the demonstration can be estimated. Overall, t he state will be expected to make a significant and sustained effort to conduc t a robust evaluation covering all demonstration policy components. The state must also investigate cost outcomes for the demonstration as a whole, including but not limited to: administrative costs of demonstration implementation and operation, Medicaid health service expenditures and provider uncompensated care costs. In addition, the state must use hypothesis tests aligned with other demonstration goals and cost analyses together to assess the demonstration's effects on Medicaid program sustainability. The demonstration extension includes robust monitoring and evaluation requirements and the demonstration may be suspended or withdrawn, if monitoring and evaluation data raise concerning evidence. Specifically, these STCs outline that CMS reserves the ri ght to require the state to take corrective action, which could include suspending implementation of specific provisions of the demonstration, if monitoring or evaluation data indicate substantial and sustained directional change inconsistent with state ta rgets (such as substantial and sustained trends indicating increased difficulty accessing services). CMS further ha s the ability to suspend implementation of part or the whole of the demonstration should corrective actions not effectively resolve these concerns in a timely manner. The STCs will aid the state and CMS in measuring and tracking the demonstration's impact, and give CMS additional tools to protect beneficiaries if necessary. Further, CMS reserves the right to withdraw waivers or expenditure authorities at any time , subject to the conditions described in the STCs, if it determines that continuing the waivers or expenditure authorities would no longer be in the beneficiaries ' interest or promote the objectives of Medicaid. Determination that the Demonstration Project is Likely to A ssist in P romoting Medicaid's Objectives For the reasons discussed below, the Secretary has determined that the Florida MMA demonstration is likely to assist in promoting the objectives of the Medicaid program. The demonstration will expand coverage and improve health outcomes . This demonstration implement s a pilot program that provides additional behavioral health services and supportive housing assistance services for demonstration enrollees aged 21 and older with SMI, SUD or SMI with co- occurring SUD, who are homeless or at risk of homelessness due to the ir disability in two regions in the state. The behavioral health and supportive housing assistance pilot will provide enrollees with the tools necessary to improve health outcomes and achieve stable tenancy , while reducing state costs related to unnecessary beneficiary service utilization . This will allow beneficiaries to regain capability for independence at a more cost effective manner to the state. Page 7 - Ms. Beth Kidder This approval will improve access to services, care coordination, and health outcomes for beneficiaries by continuing to provide services statewide to recipients required to enroll in a dental plan through prepaid dental health programs or a managed care plan in the MM A program . The demonstration will provide for LIP payments to eligible providers that improve the sustainability of the safety net. The continuation of the existing LIP promotes stability in safety net providers that provide care to the uninsured, as well as to Medicaid beneficiaries. Without providing funding to offset the costs incurred by eligible providers to provide charity care to the indigent, they might not have the capacity or funding to continue operating at a level consist ent with adequate access for Medicaid beneficiaries. This demonstration aims to promote the Medicaid objectives by increasing access to safety net providers that serve the state's uninsured individuals and Medicaid beneficiaries . LIP payments may be used by eligible providers to offset the uncompensated costs of treating the uninsured, but this expenditure authority does not make uninsured patients eligible for any benefits under the demonstration. Consideration of Public Comments To incr ease the transparency of demonstration projects, sections 1115(d)(1) and (2) of the Act direct the Secretary to issue regulations providing for two periods of public comment on a state's application for a section 1115 demonstration that would result in an impact on eligibility, enrollment, benefits, cost -sharing, or financing. The first comment period occurs at the state level before submission of the s ection 1115 application, and the second comment period occurs at the federal level after the application is received by the Secretary. As enacted by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and incorporated under section 1115(d)(2)(A) and (C) of the Act, comment periods should be \"sufficient to ensure a meaningful level of public input\" but the statute imposed no additional requirement on the states or the Secretary to provide individualized response s to address those comments, as might otherwise be required under a general rulemaking. Accordingly, the implementing regulations issued in 2012 provide that CMS will review and consider all comments received by the deadline, but will not provide individualized written responses to public comments. The state public comment period began June 1, 2020 and ended on June 30, 2020. The state received several comments expressing concerns about the extension of the waiver of retroactive eligibility. These comments raised questions regarding the evaluation of the retroactive eligibility waiver an d concerns about the impacts it has on Medicaid beneficiaries ' access to care and medical debt. Several comments expressed the importance of the LIP program and inquired about the LIP allotment and whether it will be increased. The state received questions regarding why the s tate was only requesting a 2 -year extension. This comment prompted the state to negotiate a longer extension period with CMS. While the state is not recommending changes to the demonstration for all of these comment s, the state will consider all comments and may undertake efforts related to these comments in the future. Page 8 - Ms. Beth Kidder The federal public comment period was open from August 12, 2020 through September 11, 2020. CMS received over 50 public comments during the federal comment period on Medicaid.gov. Although CMS is not legally required to provide written responses to comments, CMS is addressing some of the central issues raised by the commenters and summarizing CMS' analysis of those issues for the benefit of stakeholders. After carefully reviewing the public comments submitted during the federal comment period, CMS has concluded that the demonstration project is likely to promote the objectives of Medicaid . General Comments The majority of comments expressed opposition to the extension. Most commenters also identified themselves as therapist s and expressed frustration working with one of the managed care entities contracted by the state to cover certain region s in Florida . They pointed to issues with enrolling into the managed care group, the difficult claim submission system and low payment rates . However, c ontracting with a managed care organization (MCO) is at the state's discretion and thus, comment ers are encouraged to contact the state directly to discuss issues regarding MCOs . Another commentator oppose d the extension because they do not believe Florida should be allowed to continue to only have one vendor for hemophilia medications. However, CMS has already granted authority to allow Florida flexibility to contract with one to three vendors under the Comprehensive H emophilia Disease Management Program . Some commenters supported continuing the LIP program while others supported LIP but wanted it to expand to providers in more areas such as SUD. The current LIP program includes comm unity behavioral health centers, which provide SUD services. Comments on Waiver of Retroactive Eligibility A few commenters expressed concerns that the waiver of retroactive eligibility will create economic hardships , reduce coverage, and not allow timely provisions of Medicaid eligibility for those who find themselves in the hospital unexpectedly. Florida is testing whether waiving retroactive eligibility for certain groups of Medicaid beneficiaries will encourage them to obtain and maintain health coverage, even when healthy, or to obtain health coverage as soon as possible after becoming eligible , rather than waiting until they fall sick. To increase awareness of the waiver of retroactive eligibility and promote the objectives of the Medicaid program in the way of encouraging continuity of coverage and care, the state has established a robust outreach and communication system to disseminate information about the waiver policy . The outreach efforts are designed to ensure that beneficiaries understand the importance of applying for Florida Medicaid timely, and to encourage providers and stakeholders who help individuals enroll in Florida Medicaid and assist individuals to apply at the earliest opportunity. T hrough electronic health records, the state has implemented, a work force to track patients and monitor changes in their circumstances. This tracking system will notify the state of changes in an individual's eligibility for Medicaid. The state has also implemented the use of mobile devi ces at the bedside to facilitate timely application submission . In addition, t he state continues to maintain and circulate information through other platforms such as the state Medicaid website and the website of the Department of Children and Families, which proce sses eligibility applications , and co mmunicates with associations representing hospitals and nursing facilities, Page 9 - Ms. Beth Kidder sends electronic provider alerts , engag es with other community partners and ensures appropriate staff training. During the demonstration extension period, t he state will comprehensively evaluate the waiver of retroactive eligibility policy to understand how it affects outcomes, such as enrollment , enrollment continuity, enrollment when people are healthy and health status as a result of greater enrollment continuity. The state will also evaluate the impact of this policy in the context of the overall demonstration. T he state's approved E valuation D esign , which covers the period from the waiver's implementation in Florida through December 31, 2020, proposes rigorous approaches to evaluat e this policy . Specifically, t he design proposes to study beneficiary understanding of the policy, barriers to timely r enewal, enrollment and enrollment continuity, health outcomes and beneficiary financial burden . Findings from this analysis will be included in the state's S ummative E valuation R eport, which is due to CMS on June 30, 2022. Going forward, the state will be required to submit for CMS review and approval an Evaluation Design pertinent to the demonstration extension period which will assist the state in continuing its careful evaluation of the waiver of retroactive eligibility policy . The state also will be required to report monitoring metrics related to this policy , for example, on the number of beneficiaries with gaps in coverage and unpaid medical bills at the time of application . Florida has state legislative authority for the waiv er of retroactive eligibility through June 30, 2021.9 The state must submit a letter to CMS within 60 days of state legislative approval to extend the waiver of retroactive eligibility beyond June 30, 2021. Absent state legislative authority, the waiver of retroactive eligibility will expire on Ju ly 1, 2021. In addition, a s described in the STCs, if monitoring or evaluation data indicate that demonstration features are not likely to assist in promoting the objectives of Medicaid, CMS reserves the right to require the state to submit a corrective action plan to CMS for approval. Finally , CMS also reserves the right to withdraw waivers or expenditure authorities at any time it determines that continuing the m would no longer be in the public interest or promote the objectives of Medicaid. After carefully rev iewing the public comment s submitted during the federal comment period, CMS has concluded that the extension of this demonstration is likely to advance the objectives of Medicaid. This approval does not include any new waiver or expenditure authorities, and the extension period is appropriate to provide additional time for the state to collect valuable information about the effects of the demonstration initiatives to enable their robust and meaningful evaluation. Other Information CMS's approval of this demonstration project is conditioned upon compliance with the enclosed list of waiver s and expenditure authorities and the STCs defining the nature, character, and extent of antic ipated federal involvement in the demonstration. The award is subject to our receiving your written acknowledgement of the award and acceptance of these STCs within 30 days of the date of this letter. 9 Available at https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2020/5003/BillText/er/PDF .

Schedule of State Deliverables Attachment A: Comprehensive Program Description Attachment B: Developing the Evaluation Design Attachment C: Preparing the Evaluation Report Attachment D: Monitoring Protocol (reserved) II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES Florida's current 1115 demonstration allows the state to opera te a comprehensive Medicaid mana ged care program and a Prepaid Ambulatory Health Plan (PAHP). Under the demonstration, most Medicaid- eligibles are required to enroll in one of the MMA managed care plans (MMA plans) contracted with the state under the MMA Program. MMA plans are MCOs as defined under 42 CFR 438.2. Several populations may also voluntarily enroll in the MMA program. Applicants for Medicaid are given the opportunity to select a MMA plan prior to receiving a Florida Medicaid eligibility determin ation. If they do not choose a plan, they are auto-assigned into a MMA plan upon an affirmative eligibility determination and subsequently provided with information about their choice of plans with the auto- assignment. MMA plans are able to provide custom ized benefits to their members that differ from, but are not less than, the state plan benefits \u2014and participating Medicaid -eligibles have access to Healthy Behaviors Programs that provide incentives for healthy behaviors. Additionally, upon implementation of the prepaid dental health program (PDHP), dental managed care plans (dental plans) will provide State Plan dental services and provide services statewide to recipients required to enroll in a dental plan. The dental plans are PAHPs as defined under 42 CFR 438.2. The demonstration also establishes a Low Income Pool (LIP) to ensure continuing support for the safety net providers that furnish uncompensated care (UC) to uninsured populations.1 The renewal approved in August 2017 allowed the state to conti nue operating the MMA program while increasing the LIP to $1.5 billion annually. This prior renewal also removed historical information about implementation of the MMA program from the STCs and modified the frequency of state -reported demonstration activit ies\u2014based on the long -standing nature of the demonstration, the consistency in its operations, and the lack of significant issues or corrective actions needed. All reporting modifications , at that time, provide d CMS and the public with the information nece ssary to effectively monitor and evaluate the MMA demonstration. On November 30, 2018, an amendment was approved to the demonstration that, allows the state to operate a statewide Prepaid Dental Health Program, modifies the LIP to add Regional 1 1 For the \"Comprehensive Program Description and Objectives,\" see Attachment B. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 7 of 80 Perinatal I ntensive Care Centers (RPICCs) as an eligible hospital ownership subgroup and community behavioral health providers as a participating provider group, and waives retroactive eligibility for all beneficiaries under the demonstration, except for pregnant women, women 60 days or less post -partum, and beneficiaries under age 21 (non- pregnant adults). The approval of the waiver of retroactive eligibility will encourage Medicaid beneficiaries to obtain and maintain health coverage, even when healthy, or to obtain health coverage as soon as possible after becoming eligible (if eligibility depends on a finding of disability or a certain diagnosis). On March 26, 2019, an amendment was approved to the demonstration to i mplement a pilot program that provides additiona l behavioral health services and supportive housing assistance services for persons aged 21 and older with serious mental illness (SMI), substance use disorder (SUD) or SMI with co -occurring SUD, who are homeless or at risk of homelessness due to their disability. The pilot program will be operated in two regions of the State , Regions 5 (Pasco and Pinellas counties) and Region 7 (Brevard, Orange, Osceola and Seminole counties). On February 18, 2020, an amendment was approved to the demonstration that enable s Florida to increase the behavioral health and supportive housing assistance services annual enrollment limit, modify the LIP permissible expenditures related to Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) and Rural Health Clinics (RHC), and memorialize s some budget neutrality -related edits to the Supportive Housing Pilot table. Under the demonstration, Florida seeks to continue building on the following objectives: Improving outcomes through care coordination, patient engagement in their own health care, and maintaining fiscal responsibility. The demonstration seeks to improve care for Medicaid beneficiaries by providing care through nationally accredited managed care plans with broad networks, expansive benefits packages, top quality scores, and high rate of customer satisfaction. The state will provide oversight focused on improving access and increasing quality of care. Improving program performance, particularly improved scores on nationally recognized quality measures (such as Healthcare Effectiveness D ata and Information Set [HEDIS] scores), through expanding key components of the Medicaid managed care program statewide and competitively procuring plans on a regional basis to stabilize plan participation and enhance continuity of care. A key objective of improved program performance is to increase patient satisfaction. Improving access to coordinated care, continuity of care, and continuity of coverage by enrolling all Medicaid enrollees in managed care in a timely manner, except those specifically exemp ted. Increasing access to, stabilizing, and strengthening providers that serve uninsured, low- income populations in the state by targeting LIP funding to reimburse UC costs for services provided to low -income uninsured patients at hospitals , federally qualified health care centers (FQHC) and rural health clinics (RHC) that are furnished through charity care programs that adhere to the Healthcare Financial Management Association (HFMA) principles.2 2 Available at http://www .hfma.org/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=14589 Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 8 of 80 Improving continuity of coverage and care and encouraging uptake of preventive services, or en couraging individuals to obtain health coverage as soon as possible after becoming eligible, as applicable, as well as promoting the fiscal sustainability of the Medicaid program, through the waiver of retroactive eligibility. Improving integration of all services, increased care coordination effectiveness, increased individual involvement in their care, improved health outcomes, and reductions in unnecessary or inefficient use of health care .

Voluntary enrollees - The following individuals are excluded from mandatory enrollment into the MMA program under subparagraph (a) but may choose to volunt arily enroll under the demonstration, in which case the individual would be a voluntary participant in an MMA plan and would receive its benefits: i. Individuals who have other creditable health care coverage, excluding Medicare; ii. Individuals age 65 and over residing in a mental health treatment facility meeting the Medicare conditions of participation for a hospital or nursing facility; iii. Individuals in an intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities (ICF -IID); iv. Individuals with developmental disabilities enrolled in the home and community - based waiv er pursuant to state law, and Medicaid recipients waiting for waiver services; v. Children receiving services in a Prescribed Pediatric Extended Care (PPEC) facility; and vi. Medicaid -eligible recipients residing in group home facilities licensed under section(s) 393.067 F.S. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 19 of 80 d. Excluded from MMA Program Participation - The following groups of Medicaid eligibles are excluded from enrollment in managed care plans. i. Individuals eligible for emer gency services only due to immigration status; ii. Family planning waiver eligibles; iii. Individuals eligible due to breast or cervical cancer; and, iv. Services for individuals who are residing in residential commitment facilities operated through the Department o f Juvenile Justice, as defined in state law. (These individuals are inmates not eligible for covered services under the state plan, except as inpatients in a medical institution). 22. Indian Health Care Providers and Managed Care Protections. a. The state will assure compliance by the state with the requirements of section 1911 of the Social Security Act and 25 USC \u00a71647a(a)(1), to accept an entity that is operated by the Indian Health Service (IHS) an Indian tribe, tribal organization, or urban Indian health pr ogram as a provider eligible to receive payment under the program for health care services furnished to an Indian on the same basis as any other provider qualified to participate as a provider of health care services under the program, if the entity meets generally applicable State or other requirements for participation as a provider of health care services under the program. b. The state will assure compliance by the state with 42 CFR 431.110(b), which specifies that an IHS facility meeting state requiremen ts for Medicaid participation must be accepted as a Medicaid provider on the same basis as any other qualified provider, and also specifies that when state licensure is normally required, the facility need not obtain a license but must meet all applicable standards for licensure. In determining whether a facility meets these standards, the state may not take into account an absence of licensure of any staff member of the facility. VI. ENROLLMENT This section describes enrollment provisions that are applicable to Medicaid -eligible individuals in Medicaid managed care plans. All Medicaid recipients, except those specified in STC 55, must enroll in the Prepaid Dental Health Program (PDHP) in order to receive dental services covered under the Florida Medicaid prog ram. The state will implement the PDHP in three phases by region, beginning December 1, 2018, with completion by March 1, 2019. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 20 of 80 23. New Enrollees. 42 CFR \u00a7 438.71 requires choice counseling as part of the beneficiary support system. At the time of their application for Medicaid, individuals who are mandated to enroll in an MMA or dental plan must receive information about MMA and dental plan choices in their area. They must be informed of their options in selecting an authorized MMA/dental plan. Individuals must be provided the opportunity to meet or speak with a choice counselor to obtain additional information in making a choice, and to indicate a plan choice selection if they are prepared to do so. Eligible individuals will be enrol led in a MMA and dental pl an upon eligibility determination. If the individual has not selected a plan at the time of the approval of eligibility, the state may auto -assign the individual into a MMA/dental plan. Upon enrollment, individuals will receive information on their MMA and dental plan assignments or selection and information about all plans in their area. Individuals may actively select a plan or change their plan selection during a 120- day change/disenrollment - period without cause post -enrollment. All individuals will be provided with information regarding their rights to change plans. Once the plan selection is registered and takes effect, the plan must communicate to the enrollee, in accordance with 42 CFR 438.10, the benefits covered under the plan, and how to access th ose benefits. 24. Auto -Enrollment Criteria. Each enrollee must have an opportunity to select a MMA and dental plan before or upon being determined eligible. Individuals must be provided information to encourage an active selection electronically or in print. Enrollees who fail to choose a plan by the time their eligibility is determined will be auto -assigned to a MMA and/or dental plan. At a minimum, the state must use the criteria listed below when assigning an enrollee to a MMA or dental plan, in addition to criteria identified in 42 CFR 438.54. When more than one plan meets the assignment criteria, the state will make enrollee assignments consecutively by family unit. MMA criteria include but are not limited to: a. Whether the plan has sufficient provider net work capacity to meet the needs of the enrollee; b. Whether the recipient has previously received services from one of the plan's primary care providers; and c. Whether primary care providers in one plan are more geographically accessible to the recipient's re sidence than those in other plans. PDHP criteria include but are not limited to: a. Whether the plan has sufficient network capacity to meet the needs of the recipients such as geographic accessibility based on beneficiary's residence; b. Whether the recipien t has a family member enrolled in one of the PDHP plans. c. A newborn of a mother enrolled in a plan at the time of the child's birth shall be Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 21 of 80 enrolled in the mother's plan. Upon birth, such a newborn is deemed enrolled in the dental plan, regardless of the administrative enrollment procedures, and the dental plan i s responsible for providing Medicaid services to the newborn. The mother may choose another dental plan for the newborn within 120 days after the child's birth. 25. Auto Enrollment for Special Populat ions. For an enrollee who is also a recipient of Supplement al Security Income (SSI), prior to auto -assigning the SSI beneficiary to an MMA plan, the state must determine whether the SSI beneficiary has an ongoing relationship with a provider or managed car e plan; and if so in addition to complying with \u00a7 438.54(d) , the state must assign the SSI recipient to that managed care plan whenever feasible. Assignment based on an ongoing relationship with a provider or managed care plan is the first priority in ass igning enrollees pursuant to this STC. Those SSI recipients who do not have such a provider relationship must be assigned to a managed care plan using the assignment criteria previously outlined. In addition to complying with \u00a7 438.54(d), the state must us e the following parameters when auto -assigning recipients who are members of the indicated special populations to a plan. The analogous requirements for auto enrollment into both MMA and PDHP plans are mentioned above in STC 24. a. To promote alignment betwe en Medicaid and Medicare, each beneficiary who is enrolled with a Medicare Advantage Organization, must first be assigned to any MMA plan in the beneficiary's region that is operated by the same parent organization as the beneficiary's Medicare Advantage O rganization. If there is no match of parent organization or plan within the organization, then the beneficiary should be assigned as in sub-STC 2 4 above. b. If an applicable specialty plan is available, as described in STC 37, the recipient should be assigned to the specialty plan. c. Newborns of eligible mothers enrolled in a plan at the time of the child's birth will be automatically enrolled in that plan, unless it is a specialty plan; however, the mother may choose another plan for the newborn within 120 days after the child's birth. d. Foster care children will be assigned/re -assigned to the same plan to which the child was most recently assigned in the last 12 months, if applicable. e. Lock -In/Disenrollment. Once a mandatory enrol lee has selected or been assigned an MMA or dental plan, the enrollee shall be enrolled for a total of 12 months, until the next open enrollment period, unless the individual is determined ineligible for Medicaid. The 12- month period includes a 120 -day per iod to change or voluntarily disenroll from a plan without cause and select another plan. If an individual chooses to remain in a plan past 120 days, the individual will be permitted no further changes in enrollment until the next open enrollment period, except for cause. Good cause r easons for disenrollment from a plan are defined in Rule 59- G-8.600, Florida Administrative Code. Voluntary enrollees may disenroll Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 22 of 80 from the MMA plan at any time and enroll in another managed care plan or receive their services through Florida FFS Medicaid. This Florida rule is compliant with \u00a7 438.56(c) and (d)(2). f. The choice counselor or state will record the plan change/disenrollment reason for all recipients who request such a change. The state or the state's designee will be responsible for processing all enrollments and disenrollments . 26. Re-enrollment. In instances of a temporary loss of Medicaid eligibility, which the state is defining as 6 months or less, the state will re -enroll demonstration enrollees in the same MMA o r dental plan they were enrolled in prior to the temporary loss of eligibility unless enrollment into the entity has been suspended due to plan requested or Agency - imposed enrollment freeze. The individual will have the same change/disenrollment period wit hout cause as upon initial enrollment. VII. BENEFIT PACKAGES AND PLANS IN THE MMA PROGRAM 27. Customized Benefit Packages . MMA plans have the flexibility to provide customized benefit packages for demonstration enrollees as long as the benefit package meets certain minimum standards describe d in this STC, and actuarial benefit equivalency requirements and benefit sufficiency requirements described in STCs 2 8 through 31, in accordance with section 409.973 F.S. For other plans, customized benefit packages must include all state plan services ot herwise available under the state plan for pregnant women and children including all EPSDT services for children under age 21. The customized benefit packages must include all mandatory services specified in the state plan for all populations. The amount, duration and scope of optional services, may vary to reflect the needs of the plan's target population as defined by the plan and approved by the Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA). These plans can also offer additi onal services and benefits not available under the state plan. The plans contracted with the state shall not have service limits more restrictive than authorized in the state plan for children under the age of 21, pregnant women, and emergency services. Policies for determining medical necessity for children covered under the EPSDT benefit must be consistent with Fede ral statute at \u00a71905(r) of the Act in authorizing vision, dental, hearing services, and other necessary health care, diagnostic services, tre atment and other measures described in \u00a71905(a) of the Act to correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by screening services, whether or not such services are covered in the state plan. EPSDT provisions apply as well to the PDHPs. 28. Overall Standards for Customized Benefit Packages for MMA Plans. All benefit packages must be prior -approved by the state and CMS and must be at least actuarially equivalent to the services provided to the target population under the current state plan benef it package. In addition, the plan's customized benefit package must meet a sufficiency test to ensure that it is sufficient to meet the medical needs of the target Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 23 of 80 population. Consistent with 42 CFR 438.3, customized benefit pac kages, as analyzed through the Plan Evaluation Tool (PET) discussed below, must be submitted to CMS for approval as part of the standard CMS contract review process. 29. Plan Evaluation Tool. The state will utilize a Plan Evaluation Tool (PET) to determine if a plan that is applying for, or has been awarded, an MMA plan contract meets state requirements. The PET measures actuarial equivalency and sufficiency. Specifically, the PET: (1) compares the value of the level of benefits (actuarial equivalency) in the proposed package to the value of the current state plan package for the average member of the population; and (2) ensures the sufficiency of benefits consistent with 42 CFR 438.210(a)(3) and STC 3 0. The state will evaluate service utilization on an annual basis and use this informati on to update the PET to ensure that actuarial equivalence calculations and sufficiency thresholds reflect current utilization levels. 30. Plan Evaluation Tool: Sufficiency. In addition to meeting the actuarial equivalence test, each health plan's proposed cus tomized benefit package must meet or exceed, and maintain, a minimum threshold of 98.5 percent. The sufficiency test provides a safeguard when plans elect to vary the amount, duration and scope of certain services. This standard is based on the target -population's historic use of the applicable Medicaid state plan services (e.g. outpatient hospital services, outpatient pharmacy prescriptions) identified by the state as sufficiency -tested benefits. Each proposed benefit plan must be evaluated against the sufficiency standard to ensure that the proposed benefits are adequate to meet the needs of 98.5 percent of enrollees. 31. Evaluation of Plan Benefits. The state will review and update the PET for assessing a plan's benefit structure to ensure actuarial equivalence and that services are sufficient to meet the needs of enrollees in the given service area. At a minimum, the state must conduct the review and update on an annual basis. The state will provide CMS with 60- days advance notic e and a copy of any proposed changes to the PET. VIII. COST -SHARING 32. Premiums and Co -Payments. The state must pre -approve all cost sharing allowed by MMA or dental plans. Cost -sharing must be consistent with the state plan except that managed care plans may elect to assess cost -sharing that is less than what is allowed under the state plan. 33. American Indians. Indians who receive services directly by an Indian Health Care Provider (IHCP) or through referral under Purchased/Referred Care services shall not be impo sed any enrollment fee, premium, or similar charge. No deduction, copayment, cost sharing or similar charges shall be imposed against any such Indian. Payments due to an IHCP or to a health care provider through referral under Purchased/Referred Care servi ces for services provided to an eligible Indian shall not be reduced by the amount of any enrollment fee, premium, or similar charge, or any deduction, copayment, cost sharing or similar charges, that would be due from the Indian but for the prohibition on charging the Indian. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 24 of 80 IX. DELIV ERY SYSTEMS 34. Health Plans. The final contracts and, as applicable, capitation rates developed to implement selective contracting by the state with any MCO, provider group, Prepaid Inpatient Health Plan (PIHP) or Prepaid Ambulatory Health Plan (PAHP) shall be subject to CMS approval prior to implementation. The state may enter into contracts for Medicaid managed care plans with the following entities : a. Managed Care Organization (MCO) - An entity (such as Health Maintenance Organi zation, Accountable Care Organization, capitated Provider Service Network, or Exclusive Provider Organization) that meets the definition of MCO as described in 42 CFR 438.2, and which must conform to all of the requirements in 42 CFR 438 that apply to MCOs . b. Provider Service Network (PSN) - An entity established or organized by a health care provider or group of affiliated health care providers that meet the requirements of FS 409.912. A PSN may be reimbursed on a FFS or capitated basis as specified in stat e statute. Capitated PSNs are categorized as MCOs, and must meet the requirements as described in 42 CFR 438. c. Prepaid Inpatient Health Plan (PIHP), Prepaid Ambulatory Health Plan (PAHP) - Entities that meet the definition or PIHP or PAHP as described in 42 CFR 438.2 and which must conform to all requirements in 42 CFR 438 that apply to PIHPs and PAHPs. 35. Eligible Plan Selection. The state will procure a specified number of MMA plans per region in accordance with section 409.974, Florida Statutes. A minimum a nd maximum number of plans are specified by region, with a minimum of two plans choices in each region. Issuance and award of the procurements will provide for a choice of plans, as well as market stability. Should the state not be able to contract with a t least two MMA plans in a region that is not rural, the state will issue another procurement to obtain a second plan and meet the federal requirements in 42 CFR \u00a7438.52(a). Until two MMA plans are available in the impacted region, beneficiaries may volunt arily choose to enroll in the available MMA plan or to access services through a FFS delivery system. In addition to regional plans, the state will also seek to contract with specialty plans, as discussed in STC 37. Participa tion of specialty plans will be subject to competitive procurement requirements but will not be considered in assessing regional plan availability. Specialty plans are subject to 42 CFR 438.52 choice require ment. However, the state may not enter into contr acts with additional specialty plans in a region if total enrollment in all specialty plans in the region is g reater than ten percent of demonstration enrollees in the region. The state will procure at least two statewide dental plans for the PDHP in acco rdance with Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 25 of 80 section 409.973(5), Florida Statutes. To qualify for a contract under the PDHP, an entity must be licensed as a prepaid limited health service organization under Part I of Chapter 636, Florida Statutes, or as a health maintenance organization under Part I of Chapter 641, Florida Statutes. Should the state undergo another Medicaid managed care procurement for MMA or dental plans during the demonstration period, the state must submit a report to CMS no later than 30 days after the selection of new managed care plans that will include the following, as applicable in addition to 42 CFR 438.66(d): a. The name of the managed care plans selected for each region; b. For the selected plans, please identify those plans that also provide LTSS under the 1915(b )/(c) waivers; c. The names of any managed care plans that will not be continuing by region; and, d. The number of enrolled beneficiaries in each plan that will not be continuing. 36. MMA Plan Selection when beneficiary also has Medicare Advantage. a. While beneficiaries are encouraged to select the same MMA plan as their Medicare Advantage or Long -term Care (LTC) Plan, if applicable, it is not a requirement. b. Should a beneficiary choose an MMA plan that is different from their Medicare Advantage or LTC plan, if applicable, the two entities must coordinate the beneficiary's care to ensure that all needs are met. The state must monitor such care coordination through its contract with the MCO and with the MAO under 42 CFR 422.107. 37. Specialty Plans. A specialty plan is defined as a plan that exclusively enrolls, or enrolls a disproportionate percentage of, special needs individuals and that has been approved by the state as a specialty plan to provide medical services. Specialty plans are designed for a target population, for example, children with chronic conditions, or recipients who have been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. Participation of specialty plans will be subject to competitive procurement and the aggregate enrollment of all specialty plans in a region may not exceed 10 percent of the demonstration enrollees of that region. The state will freeze enrollment for specialty plans if the aforementioned enrollment limit is reached in a region. The Children's Medical Services Plan, a specialty plan operated by the Florida Department of Health, is not subject to competitive procurement . 38. The state may approve specialty plans on a case- by-case basis using criteria that include appropriateness of the target population and the presence of clinical programs and/or providers with s pecial expertise to serve that target population in the specialty plan's provider network. The state may not approve plans that discriminate against members of Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 26 of 80 the target population with greater health care needs. The state may also contract with Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAO) to serve Medicare- Medicaid enrollees as a dual eligible special needs plan (D -SNP) under 42 CF R 422.107. In addition to meeting the solvency (42 CFR 438.116) and network adequacy and sufficiency (42 CFR 438.68, 438.206 and 438.207) requirements, specialty plans must also meet enhanced standards developed by the state that may include but are not limited to: a. Appropriate integrated provider network of primary care physicians and specialists who are trained to provide services for a particular condition or population. The network should include an integrated network of PCPs and specialists appropriate for the target population (e.g., nephrologists for kidney disease; cardiologists for cardiac disease; infectious disease speciali sts and immunologists for HIV/AIDS). b. In recognition that many individuals will have multiple diagnoses, plans should have sufficient capacity of additional specialists to manage the co -occurring diagnoses that may occur within the target population. c. Defined network of facilities that are used for inpatient care, including the use of accredited tertiary hospitals and hospitals that have been designated for specific conditions (e.g., end stage renal disease centers, comprehensive hemophilia centers). d. Avail ability of specialty pharmacies, where appropriate. e. Availability of a range of community -based care options as alternatives to hospitalization and institutionalization. f. Clearly defined coordination of care component that links and shares information betw een and among the primary care provider, the specialists, and the patient to appropriately manage co-morbidities. g. Use of evidence- based clinical guidelines in the management of the disorder. h. Development of a care plan and involvement of the patient in the development and management of the care plan, as appropriate. i. Development and implementation of a disease management program specific to the specialty population(s) or disease state(s), including a specialized process for transition of enrollees from dis ease management services outside of the plan to the plan's disease management program. 39. Requirements for Special Populations. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 27 of 80 a. HIV Specialty Plans i. The state will auto -enroll Medicaid beneficiaries identified with a diagnosis of HIV or AIDS to a specialty plan, where available, if the beneficiary does not select an MMA plan. These beneficiaries may be identified with a combination of diagnosis codes on claims; HIV or AIDS prescription medications; and laboratory tests and results. ii. The state will notify ben eficiaries identified with a diagnosis of HIV or AIDS in writing that the beneficiary must select an MMA plan or the beneficiary will be auto- assigned to a specialty plan, if available, in his or her region. The notification will provide the beneficiary w ith information regarding the benefits of enrolling in a specialty plan. The enrollee will have 120 -day period following enrollment to change plans or disenroll without cause. iii. When making assignments to an HIV/AIDS specialty plan, the state will consider the beneficiary's PCP and/or current prescriber of HIV or AIDS medications. iv. When making assignments to HIV/AIDS specialty plans and the beneficiary's PCP or current prescriber of HIV or AIDS medications is not known or is not an enrolled provider with a s pecialty plan, the state will assign the beneficiary to a specialty plan available on a rotating basis. v. When making assignments to HIV/AIDS specialty plans of beneficiaries who are determined to have co -morbid conditions, the state may assign the benefici ary to the most appropriate specialty plan available in the beneficiary's region. b. Children's Specialty Plans i. The state may elect to contract with Children's Specialty Plans to serve Foster Care Children. These plans will have special requirements for imm ediate assessment, care coordination, and treatment of Foster Care Children. The Children's Specialty Plans are required to furnish EPSDT for Foster Care Children and follow the state's medication formulary. ii. The Foster Care child's legal guardian may enro ll the child in an MMA plan, or any specialty plan for which the child is eligible, that are available in the child's region. iii. Should a Foster Care child's legal guardian fail to make an affirmative selection of an MMA plan, the state may enroll the foster care child into a Children's Specialty Plan available in the region. 40. Compliance with Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care Regulations . The state must comply with all Medicaid and CHIP managed care requirements set forth in 42 CFR Parts Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 28 of 80 431, 433, 438, 440, 457 and 495, including the Indian specific provisions at 42 CFR \u00a7438.14 unless waived or identified as not applicable in the waiver and expenditure authority documents, of which these STCs are a part. This includes: a. Definitions of Indians and Indian Health C are Provider ( IHCP). Indians and IHCPs are defined in 42 CFR \u00a7438.14(a). b. Access to IHCP. Indians will be able to access covered benefits through the IHCP of their choice, regardless of whether the IHCP is a participating or non- participating provider. c. Referrals and Prior Authorization. Managed care entities must permit nonparticipating IHCP to refer an Indian to a network provider without having to obtain an additional referral or a prior authorization from a participating provider. d. Access to Out of Stat e IHCPs. A managed care entity must allow Indian enrollees to access out -of-state IHCPs where timely access to covered services cannot be ensured because there are few or no IHCPs in the state. e. Disenrollment from Managed Care Entity. Lack of access to in -network IHCP constitutes good cause for disenrollment from the managed care entity. f. Prompt Payment. A managed care entity must make payment to all IHCPs in its network in a timely manner as required for payments to practitioners in individual or group pra ctices under 42 CFR 438.14, 447.45 and 447.46. g.

FQHC. An IHCP that is enrolled in Medicaid as an FQHC, but that is not a participating provider of the MCO, PIHP, PAHP or PCCM entity, must be paid an amount equal to the amount the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity would pay an FQHC that is a network provider but is not an IHCP, including any supplemental payment from the state to make up the difference between the amount the MCO, PIHP, PAHP or PCCM entity pays and what the IHCP FQHC would have received under FFS. iii. Supplemental Payment. The st ate must make a supplemental payment to the IHCP to make up the difference between the amount the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity pays and the amount the IHCP would have Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 29 of 80 received under FFS or the applicable encounter rate. X. CONSUMER PROTECTIONS 41. Outreach a nd Education. The state must provide outreach and education regarding potential Medicaid eligibility and the application/enrollment process, to mitigate the potentially harmful effects of the waiver of retroactive eligibility. 42. Medical Care Advisory Commit tee. In accordance with 42 CFR \u00a7431.12, the state must maintain its Medical Care Advisory Committee (MCAC) to advise the Medicaid agency about health and medical care services. The state must ensure that the MCAC is comprised of the representatives set fo rth in 42 CFR \u00a7431.12(d). The state must ensure that the MCAC includes representation of at least four beneficiaries at all times, and report to CMS any vacant beneficiary slots that are not filled within 90 days of becoming vacant. Beneficiary representat ion may include former Florida Medicaid recipients, current Florida Medicaid recipients or family members of former or current Florida Medicaid recipients who had direct experience with helping beneficiaries access Florida Medicaid eligibility, benefits, o r services. The state may submit justification to CMS for an unfilled beneficiary slot after 90 days and CMS may grant an exception to this requirement at CMS' discretion. a. Subpopulation Advisory Committees. In addition to the MCAC and 42 CFR 438.110, the state must convene smaller advisory committees that meet on a regular basis (at least quarterly) to focus on subpopulations, including, but not limited to: beneficiaries receiving managed LTSS; beneficiaries with HIV/AIDS; children, including safeguards and performance measures related to foster children and the provision of dental care to all children; and beneficiaries receiving behavioral health/substance use disorder (SUD) services. Each advisory committee must include representation from relevant advocacy organizations, as well as beneficiaries. 43. Appointment Assistance. The state must provide, or ensure the provision of, necessary assistance with transportation and with scheduling appointments for medical, dental, vision, hearing, and mental health services. 44.

Verification of Beneficiary's Health Plan Enrollment. The state shall utilize and publicize for health plan network and non- network providers the following eligibility verification processes for beneficiaries' eligibility to be verified so that beneficiaries will not be turned away for services if the beneficiary does not have a card or presents Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 30 of 80 the incorrect card. Providers w ith a valid Medicaid provider number may use any of the following options to determine enrollee eligibility: a. Utilize the Medicaid Eligibility Verification System (MEVS): eligibility transactions may be submitted using computer software supplied by the vendor, via a point of sale device similar to those used for credit card transactions, over the telephone using a voice response system, or other possibilities depending on what the MEVS vendor offers; b. Perform single transactions (individual verifications) o r batch transactions via a secure area on the Medicaid fiscal agent's web portal; c. Utilize the Automated Voice Response System (AVRS): providers enter information via a touchtone telephone and it generates a report with all of the eligibility information f or a particular recipient, which can be faxed to the provider's fax machine; d. Submit eligibility transactions via the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI); 46. Operated Call Center Operations. The state must operate a call center(s) independent of the managed care plans for the duration of the demonstration. This can be achieved either by providing the call center directly or through the enrollment broker or other state contracted entities. Call center operations should be able to help enrollees in making independent dec isions about plan choice, and enable enrollees to voice complaints about each of the health plans independent of the health plans. 47. State Review of Beneficiary Complaints, Grievances and Appeals. The state must review complaint, grievance, and appe al logs for each health plan and data from the state or health plan operated incident management system, to understand what issues beneficiaries and providers are having with each of the health plans. The state will use this information to implement any immediate corrective actions necessary. The state will continue to monitor these statistics throughout the demonstration period and report on them in the annual monitoring reports as specified in STC 75. Data and information regarding the beneficiary complai nts, grievances, and appeals process must be made available to CMS upon request. XI. CHOICE COUNSELING The state must comply with 42 CFR 438.71(b) to provide choice counseling as an additional benefit to beneficiaries. This is additional instruction about how the state must comply with this regulation. 48. Choice Counseling Defined. The state shall contract for choice counselor services in the MMA program regions to provide full and complete information about managed care plans choices. The state will ensur e a choice counseling system that promotes and improves health literacy and provides information to reduce minority health disparities Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 31 of 80 through outreach activities. 49. Choice Counseling Materials . Through the choice counselor the state offers an extensive enr ollee education and plan rating system so individuals will fully understand their choices and be able to make an informed selection. Outcomes important to enrollees will be measured consistently for each plan using the plan report card, and information about the plan report card will be provided to the recipients. 50.

The state or the choice counselor will operate a toll -free number that individuals may call to ask questions and obtain assistance on managed care options. The call center will be operational during business days, with extended hours, and will be staffed with professionals qualified to address the needs of the enrollees and potential enrollees. The state must ensure mechanisms are in place to monitor and evaluate choice counseling call center met rics and the in dividual performance of choice counseling personnel. XII. HEALTHY BEHAVIORS PROGRAM UNDER THE MMA PROGRAM 53. Healthy Behaviors Programs. The state must require the MMA plans operating in the MMA program to establish Healthy Behaviors programs to encourage and reward healthy behaviors. For Medicare and Medicaid recipients who are enrolled in both an MMA plan and a Medicare Advantage plan, the MMA plan must coordinate their Healthy Behaviors programs with the Medicare Advantage plan. Dental plans may opt to provide Agency - approved healthy behavior programs related to dental services. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 32 of 80 a. The state must monitor to ensure that each MMA plan has, at a minimum, a medically approved smoking cessation program, a medically directed weight loss program, and an alcohol or substance abuse treatment program that meet all state requirements. b. Programs administered by plans (including MMA plans and dental plans) must comply with all applicable laws, including fraud and abuse laws that fall within the purview of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (OIG).

The LIP provides government support for safety net providers for the costs of uncompensated charity care for low -income individuals who are uninsured. Uncompensated care (UC) includes charity care for the uninsured but does not include UC for insured individuals, \"bad debt,\" or Medicaid and CHIP shortfall. LIP payments are not associated with particular individuals and are not a form of health coverage or any other benefit inuring to individuals. The resulting total computable (TC) dollar limit is enumerated in STC 62(a). 62. Availability of Low Income Pool (LIP) Funds . The following STC presents the TC dollar limit for LIP spending for the current approval period, DY 12 through 16, subject to the assurances that follow. a. Total LIP Amount. The TC dollar limit for LIP expenditures in each DY will be $1,508,385,773 through DY 1 6. b. Assurance. As reflected in the LIP participation requirements in STC 69, the state and providers that are participating in LIP will provide assurance that LIP claims include only costs associated with UC that is furnished through a charity care program and that adheres to the principles of the HFMA operated by the provider. c. Reassessment of Hospitals' Uncompensated Charity Care in DY17 . Low Incom e Pool limits for DY 17 -21 will be revised based on a reassessment of Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 42 of 80 the amount of uncompensated charity care cost provided by Florida hospitals, to take place by March 31, 2022. The state and CMS will collaborate on the reassessment, which will be based on information reported by hospitals for federal fiscal year 20 19 on schedule S -10 of the CMS 2552- 10 hospital cost report, with adjustment to ensure that LIP payments under this demonstration do not offset hospital costs in the calculation, following a me thodology approved by CMS. The results of the reassessment will be used to revise the Total LIP Amount for DY 17 -21. i. If the reassessment discussed in in this STC is not completed to produce an updated LIP limit by July 1, 2022, all payments from the LIP will be unavailable until the reassessment is complete. ii. When the 2019 S -10 data specified above becomes available, the state and CMS will collaborate to recalculate the Total LIP Amount for DY 17-21 based on this updated information. The recalculated Total L IP Amount will become the final Total LIP Amount for DY 17- 21. iii. The revised Total LIP Amount may not exceed $ 2,167,718,341 per DY, for the period covered by DY 17- 21.4 d. Reassessment of Hospitals' Uncompensated Charity Care in DY22 . Low Income Pool limits f or DY 22 - DY 24 will be revised based on a reassessment of the amount of uncompensated charity care cost provided by Florida hospitals, to take place by March 31, 2027. The state and CMS will collaborate on the reassessment, which will be based on informat ion reported by hospitals for periods beginning in federal fiscal year 2025 on schedule S -10 of the CMS 2552- 10 hospital cost report, with adjustment to ensure that LIP payments under this demonstration do not offset hospital costs in the calculation, following a methodology approved by CMS. The results of the reassessment will be used to revise the Total LIP Amount for DY 22 -DY 24 . i. If the reassessment discussed in this STC is not completed to produce an updated LIP limit by July 1, 2027, all payments from the LIP will be unavailable until the reassessment is complete. ii. When 2025 S -10 data specified above becomes available, the state and CMS will collaborate to recalculate the Total LIP Amount for DY 22 - DY 24 based on this updated information. The recalcul ated Total LIP Amount will become the final Total LIP Amount for DY 22 - DY24. iii. The revised Total LIP Amount may not exceed $ 2,167,718,341 per DY for the period covered by DY 22- 24.5 63. Capped Annual Allotments. All annual LIP funds must be expended by Septe mber 30 following each authorized DY. Any amount not expended cannot be rolled over to the next DY. Capped annual allotment amounts that are not distributed because of penalties, 4 See Com prehensive Program Description a nd Objectives listed below in attachment A 5 See Comprehensive Program Description and Objectives listed below in attachment A Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 43 of 80 recoupment due to payments exceeding UC cost, or are otherwise due to violati ng the terms of the approved STCs cannot be rolled over to another DY and are not recoverable. 64. LIP Reimbursement and Funding Methodology. The Reimbursement and Funding Methodology Document (RFMD) is prepared by the state for approval by CMS and documents LIP permissible expenditures, including the non -federal share and TC expenditures. The RFMD provides that TC LIP payments to providers for UC costs must be supported by UC costs incurred and reported by providers as charity care on the provider's financial records. Through the RFMD, the state must demonstrate that it has reconciled LIP payments to auditable costs. LIP provider payments for UC as charity care are limited to the uncompensated portion of providers' allowable costs and, in the aggregate, the a uthorized LIP pool amount for the DY. a. Prior to August 31 of each DY, the state must submit a draft of the RFMD for that DY to CMS for approval. The state may not claim FFP for LIP payments in that DY until after the RFMD for th at DY has been approved by CMS. b. For each DY, the state must reconcile LIP payments made to providers to ensure that they do not exceed allowed UC costs, using the CMS approved RFMD cost review protocol. The state must submit a LIP Cost Reconciliation report that has been examined an d attested by an independent accountancy firm to CMS within four years after the end of each DY showing cost reconciliation results by provider as required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 455.304. CMS will review the state's reconciliation and share any findings with the state. To the extent that payments are found to exceed allowed UC costs, the federal portion of any excess payment must be returned to CMS by submitting a decreasing expenditure adjustment (on Form CMS -64, Line 10B). If the state has not submitted its L IP Cost Reconciliation Report for a DY within the timeframe described above, CMS may issue a deferral or disallowance for an amount not to exceed the total of the state's submitted LIP expenditures for the DY for which the LIP Cost Reconciliation Report is overdue. c. A provider may at any time during a DY , disclose to the state that LIP payments to that provider exceeded allowed UC costs. If a provider refunds an overpayment to the state, the state must report that refund by including a decreasing expenditure adjustment on Line 10B of the CMS -64 for the quarter that it was received. If the provider reports an overpayment and does not refund that overpayment, the state has one year from the date of discovery, to have the provider refund the overpayment on the C MS-64. If the provider does not refund that overpayment within one year from the date of discovery, the state must refund the overpayment on the CMS -64. Any overpayments that have not been refunded to CMS may be subject to interest as defined under 42 CFR 433.320(a)(4). d. A provider is not eligible for an LIP payment or continued LIP payments if (i) the provider is identified in a disallowance notice from CMS to the State as having received an LIP overpayment in a specified amount in a prior year; and (ii) the provider has not entered into a repayment agreement satisfactory to the Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 44 of 80 State within 30 days after the date by which the State must credit CMS with the federal share of the specified overpayment, or (iii) the provider is in breach of a repayment agreem ent. e. A provider that is ineligible for LIP payments on the basis of the above may re-establish eligibility by making repayment arrangements satisfactory to the state. Payments from LIP to hospitals are to be considered Medicaid hospital revenue for the purpose of determining the hospital -specific disproportionate share hospital (DSH) limits defined in section 1923(g) of the Act. f. For the purposes of this STC, allowed UC cost follows the definitions described in STC 65 below. 65. Low Income Pool Permissible Expenditures . Funds from the LIP may be used to defray the actual uncompensated cost of furnishing medical services described in section 1905(a)(1) et seq. of the Act to uninsured individuals incurred by qualifying providers . a. These health care costs may be incurred by the state or by providers to furnish uncompensated medical care as charity care for low -income individuals who are uninsured. The costs must be incurred pursuant t o a charity care program that adheres to the prin ciples of the HFMA. i. Providers may be categorized in up to four groups: hospitals, Medical School Physician Practices, FQHCs/RHCs, and Community Behavioral Health Providers. Each group may be divided into up to five tiered subgroups, any of which may be ba sed on ownership, UC Ratio, or ownership and UC Ratio, or (for purposes of FQHCs/RHCs only) Section 330 Public Health Service Act grant type, or FQHC Look- Alike status . UC Ratio is defined as the amount of a provider's uncompensated uninsured charity care costs (defined in (a) above), expressed as a percentage of its privately insured patient care costs. UC Ratio for FQHCs/RHCs is defined as the amount of a provider's uncompensated uninsured charity care costs (defined in (a) above), expressed as a percenta ge of its total costs. To define subgroups by UC Ratio, providers must be ranked based on their relative UC Ratios, and may be formed into subgroups based on contiguous ranges of UC Ratios. Hospital ownership subgroups may consist of one or more of the following categories: local government, state government, or private and may be grouped by the hospital's publically owned, statutory teaching, freestanding children's, and Regional Perinatal Intensive Care Center hospital status. For each DY, up to $75,000,000 of the capped annual allotment of the LIP may be apportioned to FQHCs/RHCs. FQHCs/RHCs may be tiered in subgroups by the type of Section 330 Public Health Service Act grant type and FQHC Look -Alike status. ii. All providers that must receive some amount of payment (following (1) above) must be paid the same percentage of their charity care cost within each subgroup. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 45 of 80 iii. Within each group and ownership subgroup, providers in tiers with a lower range of UC Ratios cannot be paid a greater share of their charity care cost than providers in tiers with higher UC Ratios. iv. Determination of (1) through (3) may be effectuated using hospital -specific cost data for the DY for which payments are being allocated, or for a prior year not more than three years prior to that DY. 66. Low Income Pool Permissible Hospital Expenditures. Hospital cost expenditures from the LIP will be paid up to cost and are further defined in the RFMD utilizing methodologies from the CMS -2552 cost report plus mutually agreed upon additional costs tha t will be defined in the RFMD. The state shall not receive FFP for Medicaid and LIP payments to hospitals in excess of cost. 67. Low Income Pool Permissible Non -Hospital -Based Expenditures. To ensure services are paid up to or at cost, the RFMD defines the cost reporting strategies required to support non- hospital based LIP expenditures. 68. Permissible Sources of Funding Criteria. Sources of non- federal funding must be compliant with section 1903(w) of the Act and applicable regulations. Federal funds received from other federal programs (unless expressly authorized by federal statute to be used for matching purposes) shall be impermissible as sources of non- federal funding. XV. LOW INCOME POOL PROVIDER PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS AND DELIVERABLES 69. LIP Provider Participation Requirements . In addition to an y other applicable requirements, to be eligible for LIP funding , essential providers , must offer to contract with each managed care plan in the state and must make a good faith effort to enter into a network contract with each statewide Medicaid managed care (SMMC) plan and each SMMC specialty plan . \"Essential providers\" are defined as faculty plans of Florida medical schools and hospitals licensed as specialty children's hospitals .6 If the state determines tha t an essential provider has not offered and negotiated in good faith to enter into a network contract with each managed care plan, then the state will notify the essential provider at least 90 days in advance of the start of the third quarter of the state fiscal year that LIP payments will not be made to the essential provider beginning with the third quarter of the state fiscal year and informing the essential provider how it may avail itself of hearing 6 As detailed on AHCA's website, \"Statewide essential providers include: (1) Faculty plans of Florida medical schools, which include University of Florida College of Medicine, University of Miami School of Medicine, University of South Florida College of Medicine, University of Central Florida College of Medicine, Nova Southeastern University College of Osteopathic Medicine, Florida State University College of Medicine, and Florida International University College of Medicine.\" Available at https://ahc a.myflorida.com/ITNR/REGION%2002/MAGELLAN/Exhibit%20A -4- b,%20MMA%20Submission%20Requirements/Attachments/MMA%20SRC%2009- Attachment%202_Network%20Adequacy%20Standards%20Policy.pdf.

GENERAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 48 of 80 71. Deferral for Failure to Submit Timely Demonstration Deliverables. CMS may issue deferral s in accordance with 42 CFR part 430 subpart C, in the amount of $5,000,000 per deliverable (federal share) when items required by these STCs (e.g., required data elements, analyses, reports, design documents, presentations, and other items specified in these STCs ) (hereafter singly or collectively referred to as \"deliverable(s)\") are not submitted timely to CMS or are found to not be consistent with the requirements approved by CMS. A deferral shall not exceed the value of the federal amount for the current demonstration period. The state does not relinquish its rights provided under 42 CFR part 430 subpart C to challenge any CMS finding that the state materially failed to comply with the terms of this agreement. The follow process will be used: 1) Thir ty (30) days after the deliverable was due if the state has not submitted a written request to CMS for approval of an extension as described in subsection (b) below; or 2) Thirty days after CMS has notified the state in writing that the deliverable was not accepted for being inconsistent with the requirements of this agreement and the information needed to bring the deliverable into alignment with CMS requirements: a. CMS will issue a written notification to the state providing advance notification of a pendi ng deferral for late or non -compliant submissions of required deliverable (s). b. For each deliverable, the state may submit to CMS a written request for an extension to submit the required deliverable that includes a supporting rationale for the cause(s) of the delay and the state's anticipated date of submission . Should CMS agree to the state's request, a corresponding extension of the deferral process can be provided. CMS may agree to a corrective action as an interim step before applying the deferral, if corrective action is proposed in the state's written extension request. c. If CMS agrees to an interim corrective process in accordance with subsection (b), and the state fails to comply with the corrective action steps or still fails to submit the overdue deliverable(s) that meets the terms of this agreement, CMS may proceed with the issuance of a deferral against the next Quarterly Statement of Expenditures reported in Medicaid Budget and Expenditure System/State Children's Health Insurance Program Bu dget and Expenditure System (MBES/CBES) following a written deferral notification to the state. d. If the CMS deferral process has been initiated for state non -compliance with the terms of this agreement for submitting deliverable(s), and the state submits the overdue deliverable(s), and such deliverable(s) are accepted by CMS as meeting the standards outlined in these STCs, the deferral(s) will be released. As the purpose of a section 1115 demonstration is to test new methods of operation or service deliver y, a state's failure to submit all required monitoring reports, evaluations and other deliverables will be considered by CMS in reviewing any application for an extension, amendment, or for a new demonstration. 72. Submission of Post -Approval Deliverables. Th e state must submit all deliverables as Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 49 of 80 stipulated by CMS and within the timeframes outlined within these STCs . 73. Compliance with Federal Systems Updates . As federal systems continue to evolve and incorporate additional 1115 waiver reporting and analytics f unctions, the state will work with CMS to: 1. Revise the reporting templates and submission processes to accommodate timely compliance with the requirements of the new systems; 2. Ensure all 1115, Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T -MSIS), and other data elements that have been agreed to for reporting and analytics are provided by the state; and 3. Submit deliverables to the appropriate system as directed by CMS. 74. Monitoring Protocol. The state must submit to CMS a draft Monitoring Protocol no later than one hundred and fifty (150) calendar days after the start date of the demonstration approval period. The state must submit a revised Monitoring Protocol within sixty (60) calendar days after receipt of CMS' s comments. Once approved, the Monitoring Protocol will be incorporated into the STCs as Attachment D . At a minimum, the Monitoring Protocol will affirm the state's commitment to conduct quarterly and annual monitoring in accordance with CMS's templates. Any proposed deviations from CMS's t emplates should be documented in the Monitoring Protocol. The Monitoring Protocol will describe the quantitative and qualitative elements on which the state will report through quarterly and annual monitoring reports. For quantitative metrics , CMS will provide the state with a set of required metrics and technical specifications for data collection and analysis covering reporting topics such as enrollment, access to care, quality of care and health outcomes ( see Module #1 of the hyper linked document above for specific examples ). In addition, CMS will provide the state with metrics related to the key policies being tested under this demonstration, including but not limite d to, incentives for healthy behaviors , e.g., utilization of programs outlined in STC 53 and 53a (see examples in Module #4) and waiver of retroactive eligibility (see examples in M odule #6) . The Monitoring Protocol will specify the methods of data collec tion and timeframes for reporting on the state's progress as part of the quarterly and annual monitoring reports. For the qualitative elements (e.g., operational updates), CMS will provide the state with guidance on narrative and descriptive information w hich will supplement the quantitative metrics on key aspects of the demonstration policies. The quantitative and qualitative elements will comprise the state's quarterly and annual monitoring reports. 75. Monitoring Reports. The state must submit three (3) Q uarterly Monitoring Reports and one (1) Annual Monitoring Report each DY. The fourth quarter information that would ordinarily be provided in a separate monitoring report should be reported as distinct information within the Annual Monitoring Report. The Quarterly Monitoring Reports are due no later than sixty (60) calendar days following the end of each demonstration quarter. The Annual Monitoring Report (including the fourth- quarter information) is due no later Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 50 of 80 than ninety (90) calendar days following the end of the DY. The monitoring reports will include all required elements as per 42 CFR 431.428, and should not direct readers to links outside the monitoring report. Additional links not referenced in the document may be listed in a Reference/Bibliog raphy section. The monitoring r eports must follow the framework provided by CMS, which is subject to change as monitoring systems are developed/evolve d, and be provided in a structured manner that supports federal tracking and analysis. a. Operational Updat es - The operational updates will focus on progress toward meeting the demonstration's milestones. Additionally, p er 42 CFR 431.428, the Monitoring Reports must document any policy or administrative difficulties in operating the demonstration. The Monitoring Reports shall provide sufficient information to document key operational and other challenges, underlying causes of challenges, how challenges are being addressed, as well as key achievements and to what conditions and efforts successes can be attribu ted. The discussion should also include any issues or complaints identified by beneficiaries; lawsuits or legal actions; unusual or unanticipated trends; legislative updates; and descriptions of any public forums held. The Monitoring Report s should also include a summary of all public comments received through post -award public forums regarding the progress of the demonstration. b. Performance Metrics - The performance metrics will provide data to demonstrate how the state is progressing towards meeting t he demonstration's annual goals and overall targets , where applicable. A s will be identified in the approved Monitoring Protocol, Monitoring Reports will cover key policies under this demonstration, including but not limited to incentives for healthy beha viors (e.g., utilization of programs outlined in STC 53 and 53a) and waivers of retroactive eligibility. The performance metrics will also reflect all other components of the state's demonstration. For example, these metrics will cover enrollment, completion of incentivized health y behaviors and rewards granted, unpaid medical bills at application (if available), access to care, and quality of care and health outcomes. Per 42 CFR 431.428, the Monitoring Reports must document the impact of the demonstrat ion in providing insurance coverage to beneficiaries and the uninsured population, as well as outcomes of care, quality and cost of care, and access to care. This may also include the results of beneficiary satisfaction surveys, if conducted, and grievanc es and appeals. The required monitoring and performance metrics must be included in writing in the Monitoring Reports, and will follow the framework provided by CMS to support federal tracking and analysis. c. Budget Neutrality and Financial Reporting Requi rements - Per 42 CFR 431.428, the Monitoring Reports must document the financial performance of the demonstration. The state must provide an updated budget neutrality workbook Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 51 of 80 with every Monitoring Report that meets all the reporting requirements for moni toring budget neutrality set forth in the General Financial Requirements section of these STCs, including the submission of corrected budget neutrality data upon request. In addition, the state must report quarterly and annual expenditures associated with the populations affected by this demonstration on the Form CMS -64. Administrative costs for this demonstration should be reported separately on the CMS -64. d. Evaluation Activities and Interim Findings -Per 42 CFR 431.428, the Monitoring Reports must docum ent any results of the demonstration to date per the evaluation hypotheses. The state shall include a summary of the progress of evaluation activities, including key milestones accomplished, as well as challenges encountered and how they were addressed. 76. Corrective Action Plan Related to Monitoring. If monitoring indicates that demonstration features are not likely to assist in promoting the objectives of Medicaid, CMS reserves the right to require the state to submit a corrective action plan to CMS for a pproval. A state corrective action plan could include a temporary suspension of implementation of demonstration programs, in circumstances where monitoring indicates indicate substantial and sustained directional change inconsistent with state targets (su ch as substantial and sustained trends indicating increased difficulty accessing services). A corrective action plan may be an interim step to withdrawing waivers or expenditure authorities, as outlined in STC 9. CMS will withdraw an authority, as descri bed in STC 9, when metrics indicate substantial, sustained directional change, inconsistent with state targets, and the state has not implemented corrective action. CMS would further have the ability to suspend implementation of the demonstration should c orrective actions not effectively resolve these concerns in a timely manner. 77. Close out Report . Within 120 calendar days after the expiration of the demonstration, the state must submit a draft Close Out Report to CMS for comments. a. The draft report must comply with the most current guidance from CMS. b. The state will present to and participate in a discussion with CMS on the Close - Out report. c. The state must take into consideration CMS' comments for incorporation into the final Close Out Report. d. The fina l Close Out Report is due to CMS no later than thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of CMS' comments. e. A delay in submitting the draft or final version of the Close Out Report may subject the state to penalties described in STC 71. 78. Monitoring Calls. CMS will convene periodic conference calls with the state. a. The purpose of these calls is to discuss ongoing demonstration operation, to include (but not limited to), any significant actual or anticipated developments affecting the demonstration. Examples include implementation activities, trends in reported data on Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 52 of 80 metrics and associated mid -course adjustments, budget neutrality, and progress on evaluation activities. b. CMS will provide updates on any pending actions, as well as federal policies and issues that may affect any aspect of the demonstration. c. The state and CMS will jointly develop the agenda for the calls. 79. Post Award Forum. Pursuant to 42 CFR 431.420(c), within six (6) months of the demonstration's implementation, and annually thereafter, the state shall afford the public with an opportunity to provide meaningful comment on the progress of the demonstration. At least thirty (30) days prior to the date of the planned public forum, the state must publish the date, time and location of the forum in a prominent location on its website. The state must also post the most recent Annual M onitoring R eport on its website with the public forum announcement. Pursuant to 42 CFR 431.420(c), the state must include a summary of the comments in in the Monitor ing Report associated with the quarter in which the forum was held, as well as in its compiled Annual Monitoring Report . XVII . GENERAL FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS 80. Allowable Expenditures. This demonstration project is approved for expenditures applicable to s ervices rendered during the demonstration approval period designated by CMS. CMS will provide FFP for allowable demonstration expenditures only so long as they do not exceed the pre -defined limits as specified in these STCs.8 81. Medicaid Expenditure Groups (MEG). MEGs are defined for the purpose of identifying categories of Medicaid or demonstration expenditures subject to budget neutrality, components of budget neutrality expenditure limit calculations, and other purposes related to monitoring and tracking expenditures under the demonstration. The Master MEG Chart table (Table 2) provides a master list of MEGs defined for this demonstration. Table 2: Master MEG Chart MEG To Which BN Test Does This Apply?

Reporting Expenditures and Member Months. The state must report all demonstration expenditures claimed under the authority of title XIX of the Act and subject to budget neutrality each quarter on separate f orms CMS -64.9 Waiver and/or 64.9P Waiver, identified by the demonstration project number assigned by CMS, ( 11-W-00206/4). Separate reports must be submitted by MEG (identified by Waiver Name) and Demonstration Year (identified by the two digit project number extension). Unless specified otherwise, expenditures must be reported by DY accor ding to the dates of service associated with the expenditure. All MEGs identified in the Master MEG Chart as WW must be reported for expenditures, as further detailed in the MEG Detail for Expenditure and Member Month Reporting table below. To enable calcu lation of the budget neutrality expenditure limits, the state also must report member months of eligibility for specified MEGs. The state will work with CMS to develop a method of reporting spending on dental care through the health plans. a. Cost Settlements. The state will report any cost settlements attributable to the demonstration on the appropriate prior period adjustment schedules (form CMS - 64.9P WAIVER) for the summary sheet line 10b, in lieu of lines 9 or 10c. For any cost settlement not attributable to this demonstration, the adjustments should be reported as otherwise instructed in the State Medicaid Manual. Cost settlements must be reported by DY consistent with how the original expenditures were reported. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 54 of 80 b. Premiums and Cost Sharing Collected by t he State. The state will report any premium contributions collected by the state from demonstration enrollees quarterly on the form CMS -64 Summary Sheet line 9D, columns A and B. In order to assure that these collections are properly credited to the demons tration, quarterly premium collections (both total computable and federal share) should also be reported separately by DY on form CMS -64 Narrative, and on the Total Adjustments tab in the Budget Neutrality Monitoring Tool. In the annual calculation of expenditures subject to the budget neutrality expenditure limit, premiums collected in the demonstration year will be offset against expenditures incurred in the demonstration year for determination of the state's compliance with the budget neutrality limits. c. Pharmacy Rebates. Because pharmacy rebates are included in the base expenditures used to determine the budget neutrality expenditure limit, the state must report the portion of pharmacy rebates applicable to the demonstration on the appropriate forms CMS -64.9 WAIVER and 64.9P waiver for the demonstration, and not on any other CMS -64.9 form (to avoid double counting). The state must have a methodology for assigning a portion of pharmacy rebates to the demonstration in a way that reasonably reflects the actual rebate -eligible pharmacy utilization of the demonstration population, and which identifies pharmacy rebate amounts with DYs. Use of the methodology is subject to the approval in advance by CMS, and changes to the methodology must also be approved in adv ance by CMS. Each rebate amount must be distributed as state and federal revenue consistent with the federal matching rates under which the claim was paid. d. Administrative Costs. The state will separately track and report additional administrative costs that are directly attributable to the demonstration. All administrative costs must be identified on the forms CMS -64.10 WAIVER and/or 64.10P WAIVER, using with the waiver name \"ADM\". Unless indicated otherwise on the Master MEG Chart table, administrative c osts are not counted in the budget neutrality tests; however, these costs are subject to monitoring by CMS. e. Member Months. As part of the Quarterly and Annual Monitoring Reports described in section XX, the state must report the actual number of \"eligibl e member months\" for all demonstration enrollees for all MEGs identified as WOW Per Capita in the Master MEG Chart table above, and as also indicated in the MEG Detail for Expenditure and Member Month Reporting table below. The term \"eligible member months \" refers to the number of months in which persons enrolled in the demonstration are eligible to receive services. For example, a person who is eligible for three months contributes three eligible member months to the total. Two individuals who are eligible for two months, each contribute two eligible member months, for a total of four eligible member months. The state must submit a statement accompanying the annual report Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 55 of 80 certifying the accuracy of this information. f. Budget Neutrality Specifications Manual. The state will create and maintain a Budget Neutrality Specifications Manual that describes in detail how the state will compile data on actual expenditures related to budget neutrality, including methods used to extract and compile data from the state's Medicaid Management Information System, eligibility system, and accounting systems for reporting on the CMS -64, consistent with the terms of the demonstration. The Budget Neutrality Specifications Manual will also describe how the state compiles counts of Medicaid member months. The Budget Neutrality Specifications Manual must be made available to CMS on request. g. Excluded Services. The following services are excluded from the demonstration, in that they are excluded from the list of benefits for which MMA managed care plans will provide coverage. Expenditures for these services are not expenditures subject to the BN limit, so should not be reported on any Forms CMS -64.9 Waiver and/or 64.9P Waiver for this demonstration. i. Home and Community Based Service Wai ver Services (Model Waiver (formerly Katie Beckett Model Waiver Services), Familial Dysautonomia, Development Disabilities Individual Budgeting); ii. Long Term Care Waiver; iii. ICF/IID Institutional Services; iv. School Based Administrative Claiming; v. Prescribed pediat ric extended care (PPEC) services; vi. County matching programs (Substance Abuse and Medicaid Certified School Match Services); vii. State Mental Health Hospital services for recipients age 65 and older; viii. Certain physician -injectable procedures; and ix. Vaccines for Chi ldren program for MediKids . h. Sanctions and Liquidated Damages. If the state imposes monetary sanctions or liquidated damages against an MCO, the state must report the monetary amounts on the CMS -64 Summary Line 9D in the quarter in which the plan has exhausted all administrative appeals or the time to seek an administrative appeal has expired. i. Expenditures Subject to the Budget Neutrality Limits. The following types of expenditures are subject to the BN limits for this demonstration. i. All medical assistanc e expenditures for Medicaid beneficiaries in the categories listed in S TC 2 1(a), (b), or (c) (regardless of their managed care enrollment status), other than expenditures for services listed in STC Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 56 of 80 82(e), ii. All expenditures mad e under section 1115(a)(2) expenditure authority, including all payments made under LIP, through June 30, 2030. j. Achieved Saving Rebates and Managed Care Plans. If the state requires the managed care plans to return any monies back to the state for any pro grams that are setup by the state including the Achieved Saving Rebates program, the state must report the monetary amounts on the CMS -64 Summary Line 9D in the quarter that the state receives these monies.9 Table 3: MEG Detail for Expenditure and Member Month Reporting MEG (Waiver Name) Detailed Description Exclusions CMS -64.9 Line(s) To Use How Expend.

Demonstration Years . Demonstration Years (DY) for this demonstration are defined in the Demonstration Years table below. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 59 of 80 Table 4: Demonstration Years Demonstration Year 15 July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021 12 months Demonstration Year 16 July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022 12 month s Demonstration Year 17 July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023 12 months Demonstration Year 18 July 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024 12 months Demonstration Year 19 July 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025 12 months Demonstration Year 20 July 1, 2025 to June 30, 2026 12 months Demonstration Year 21 July 1, 2026 to June 30, 2027 12 months Demonstration Year 22 July 1, 2027 to June 30, 2028 12 months Demonstration Year 23 July 1, 2028 to June 30, 2029 12 months Demonstration Year 24 July 1, 2029 to June 30, 2030 12 months 84. Standard Medicaid Funding Process. The standard Medicaid funding process will be used for this demonstration. The state will provide quarterly expenditure reports through the Medicaid and CHIP Budget and Expenditure System (MBES/CBES) to report total expend itures for services provided under this demonstration following routine CMS -37 and CMS -64 reporting instructions as outlined in section 2500 of the State Medicaid Manual. The state will estimate matchable demonstration expenditures (total computable and f ederal share) subject to the budget neutrality expenditure limit and separately report these expenditures by quarter for each federal fiscal year on the form CMS -37 for both the medical assistance payments (MAP) and state and local administration costs (AD M). CMS shall make federal funds available based upon the state's estimate, as approved by CMS. Within thirty (30) days after the end of each quarter, the state shall submit form CMS -64 Quarterly Medicaid Expenditure Report, showing Medicaid expenditures made in the quarter just ended. If applicable, subject to the payment deferral process, CMS shall reconcile expenditures reported on form CMS -64 with federal funding previously made available to the state, and include the reconciling adjustment in the finalization of the grant award to the state. 85. Extent of Federal Financial Participation for the Demonstration . Subject to CMS approval of the source(s) of the non- federal share of funding, CMS shall provide FFP at the applicable federal matching rates for the following, subject to the limits described in Section XVIII: a. Administrative costs , including those associated with the administration of the Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 60 of 80 demonstration; b. Net expenditures and prior period adjustments of the Medicaid program that are paid in accordance with the approved Medicaid state plan; c. Net expenditures and prior period adjustments, made under 1115 demonstration authority , with dates of service during the operation of the demonstration including those made in conjunction with the demonstration, net of enrollment fees, cost sharing, pharmacy rebates, and all other types of third party liability ; d. Net expenditures and prior period adjustments for MMA Plan premiums paid to managed care entities and fee for service coverage carve- out services and for voluntary MMA populations that choose to stay in FFS; e. Net Expenditures associated with the LIP, as described in Section XIV; and, f. Pursuant to standard Medicaid financing rules, FFP is excluded for payments with respect to care or services for any indiv idual who is an inmate of a public institution (except as a patient in a medical institution) pursuant to the payment exclusion in paragraph (A) following section 1905(a)(29) of the Act. g. In addition, pursuant to standard Medicaid financing rules, FFP is e xcluded for payments with respect to care or services for any individual who has not attained 65 year of age and who is a patient in an institution for mental diseases pursuant to the payment exclusion in paragraph (B) following section 1905(a)(29) of the Act, except as provided in section 1905(a)(16) for inpatient psychiatric services for individuals under age 21. 86. Sources of Non -Federal Share. As a condition of demonstration approval, the state certifies that he non -federal share is obtained from permissi ble state and/or local funds that, unless permitted by law, are not other federal funds . The state further certifies that such funds must not be used as the match for any other Federal grant or contract, except as permitted by law. CMS approval of this de monstration does not constitute direct or indirect approval of any underlying source of non -federal share or associated funding mechanisms and all sources of non- Federal funding must be compliant with Section 1903(w) of the Act and applicable regulations. In addition, CMS reserves the right to prohibit the use of any sources of non -federal share funding that it determines impermissible. a. If requested, the state must submit for CMS review and approval documentation of any sources of non- federal share that w ould be used to fund the demonstration. b. If requested, the state must submit for CMS review and approval documentation of any sources of non- federal share that would be used to fund the demonstration. c. Without limitation, CMS may request information about the non- federal share Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 61 of 80 sources for any amendments that CMS determines may financially impact the demonstration. 87. Claiming Period. The state will report all claims for expenditures subject to the budget neutrality agreement (including any cost settlements) within two years after the calendar quarter in which the state made the expenditures. All claims for services during the demonstration period (including any cost settlements) must be made within two years after the conclusion or termination of the demonst ration. During the latter two -year period, the state will continue to identify separately net expenditures related to dates of service during the operation of the demonstration on the CMS -64 waiver forms in order to properly account for these expenditures in determining budget neutrality. 88. Future Adjustments to Budget Neutrality . CMS reserves the right to adjust the budget neutrality expenditure limit: a. To be consistent with enforcement of laws and policy statements, including regulations and letters, re garding impermissible provider payments, health care related taxes, or other payments, CMS reserves the right to make adjustments to the budget neutrality limit if any health care related tax that was in effect during the base year, or provider -related don ation that occurred during the base year, is determined by CMS to be in violation of the provider donation and health care related tax provisions of section 1903(w) of the Act. Adjustments to annual budget targets will reflect the phase out of impermissible provider payments by law or regulation, where applicable. b. To the extent that a change in federal law, regulation, or policy requires either a reduction or an increase in FFP for expenditures made under this demonstration. In this circumstance, the sta te must adopt, subject to CMS approval, a modified budget neutrality agreement as necessary to comply with such change. The modified agreement will be effective upon the implementation of the change. The trend rates for the budget neutrality agreement are not subject to change under this STC. The state agrees that if mandated changes in the federal law require state legislation, the changes shall take effect on the day such state legislation becomes effective, or on the last day such legislation was require d to be in effect under the federal law. c. The state certifies that the data it provided to establish the budget neutrality expenditure limit are accurate based on the state's accounting of recorded historical expenditures or the next best available data, that the data are allowable in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes, regulations, and policies, and that the data are correct to the best of the state's knowledge and belief. The data supplied by the state to set the budget neutral ity expenditure limit are subject to review and audit, and if found to be inaccurate, will result in a modified budget neutrality expenditure limit. 89. Budget Neutrality Monitoring Tool . The state must provide CMS with quarterly budget neutrality status upda tes, including established baseline and member months data, using the Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 62 of 80 Budget Neutrality Monitoring Tool provided through the Performance Metrics Database and Analytics (PMDA) system. The tool incorporates the \"Schedule C Report\" for comparing demonstration 's actual expenditures to the budget neutrality expenditure limits described in section XI. CMS will provide technical assistance, upon request.10 90. Claiming Period. The state will report all claims for expenditures subject to the budget neutrality agreement (including any cost settlements) within two years after the calendar quarter in which the state made the expenditures. All claims for services during the demonstration period (including any cost settlements) must be made within two years after the conclus ion or termination of the demonstration. During the latter two -year period, the state will continue to identify separately net expenditures related to dates of service during the operation of the demonstration on the CMS -64 waiver forms in order to properl y account for these expenditures in determining budget neutrality. 91. Financial Integrity for Managed Care and Other Delivery Systems. As a condition of demonstration approval, the state attests to the following, as applicable: a. All risk -based managed car e organization, prepaid inpatient health plan (PIHP), and prepaid ambulatory health plan (PAHP) payments, comply with the requirements on payments in 42 CFR \u00a7438.6(b)(2), PAHPs, arrange ments comply with the upper payment limits specified in 42 CFR \u00a7447.362, and if payments exceed the cost of services, the state will recoup the excess and return the federal share of the excess to CMS. 92. Program Integrity. The state must have processes in place to ensure that there is no duplication of federal funding for any aspect of the demonstration. The state must also ensure that the state and any of its contractors follow standard program integrity principles and practices including retention of data . All data, financial reporting, and sources of non- federal share are subject to audit . XVIII. MONITORING BUDGET NEUTRALITY The following describes the method by which BN will be assured under the demonstration. The demonstration will be subject to a limit on the amount of federal Title XIX funding that the state may receive on selected Medicaid expenditures during the demonstration period. STCs 86- 87 specify the two independent financial caps on the amount of federal Title XIX funding that the state may recei ve on expenditures subject to the BN limit as defined in STC 10 42 CFR \u00a7431.420(a)(2) provides that states must comply with the terms and conditions of the agreement between the Secretary (or designee) and the state to implement a demonstration project, and \u00a7431.420(b)(1) states that the terms and conditions will provide that the state will perform periodic reviews of the implementation of the demonstration. CMS's current approach is to include language in STCs requiring, as a condition of demonstration approval, that states provide, as part of their periodic reviews, regular reports of the actual costs which are subject to the budget neutrality limit. CMS has obtained Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval of the monitoring tool under the Paperwork Reduction Act (OMB Control No. 0938 - 1148) and in states agree to use the tool as a condition of demonstration approval. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 63 of 80 94. Federal financial payments for the MMA aspects of the demonstration are limited by a Per Member Per Month (PMPM) method cap and the payments for the LIP aspects are limited by an aggregate c ap. 93. Budget Neutrality Limit for the LIP (Hypo 1) . The maximum allowable LIP amount is capped annually at $1,508,385,773 (TC). LIP funds not distributed in a DY cannot be rolled over to the next. The federal share of the TC LIP amount is the maximum amount of FFP that the state may receive for the LIP permissible expenditures detailed in STC 65. For each DY, the federal share will be calculated using the FMAP rate(s) applicable to that year. 94. Limit on PMPM Title XIX Funding . The state shall be subject to a limit on the amount of federal Title XIX funding that the state may receive on the Medicaid and demonstration expenditures identified in STC 85 during the approval period of the demonstration. The limit is determined using a PMPM method. The BN targets ar e set on a yearly basis with a cumulative BN limit for the length of the entire demonstration (see STC 97) . All data supplied by the state to CMS is subject to review and audit, and if found to be inaccurate, will result in a modified BN limit. CMS' assess ment of the state's compliance with these limits will be done using the CMS -64 Report from the MBES/CBES System. 95. Risk . The budget neutrality expenditure limits are determined on either a per capita or aggregate basis. If a per capita method is used, the state is at risk for the per capita cost of state plan and hypothetical populations, but not for the number of participants in the demonstration population. By providing FFP without regard to enrollment in the demonstration for all demonstration populations, CMS will not place the state at risk for changing economic conditions; however, by placing the state at risk for the per capita costs of the demonstration populations, CMS assures that the demonstration expenditures do not exceed the levels that would have been realized had there been no demonstration. If an aggregate method is used, the state accepts risk for both enrollment and per capita costs. 96. Composite Federal Share. The Composite Federal Share is the ratio that will be used to convert the total computable budget neutrality limit to federal share. The Composite Federal Share is the ratio calculated by dividing the sum total of FFP received by the state on actual demonstration expenditures during the approval period by total computable demonstrati on expenditures for the same period, as reported through MBES/CBES and summarized on Schedule C. Since the actual final Composite Federal Share will not be known until the end of the demonstration's approval period, for the purpose of interim monitoring of budget neutrality, a reasonable estimate of Composite Federal Share may be developed and used through the same process or through an alternative mutually agreed to method. Each Hypothetical Budget Neutrality Test has its own Composite Federal Share, as defined in the paragraph pertaining to each particular test. 97. Main Budget Neutrality Expenditure Limit Test . The following describes the method for calculating the BN expenditure limit for the demonstration. Demonstration expenditures shall be reported under the Medicaid Eligibility Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 64 of 80 Groups (MEG) listed in STC 81. For the purpose of calculating the overall PMPM expenditure limit for the demonstration, separate budget estimates will be calculated for each year on a DY basis. The annual estimates will then be summed to obtain an expenditure estimate through DY 16. The federal share of this estimate will represent the maximum amount of FFP that the state may receive for the types of Medicaid expenditures described in this section. Budget neutrality calculations for both \"With Waiver\" (WW) and \"Without Waiver\" (WOW) expenditures are applied on a statewide basis. The federal share of the BN limit will be the total computable BN limit times Composite Federal Share #1 (described below). For the purpose of monitoring BN, the annual LIP expenditures enumerated in STC 64(a) shall be considered as both WW and WOW expenditures (i.e. pass through costs). In response to the Public Health Emergency, CMS will allow for a one -time adjustment to budget neutrality to account for impacts of COVID -19 on enrollment and expenditures a. Projecting Service Expenditures - Each yearly estimate of MMA service expenditures will be the cost projections for the MEGs in sub- STC (b) below. The annual budget estimate for each MEG will be the product of the projected PMPM cost for the MEG, times the actual number of eligible member months as reported to CMS by the state under the guidelines set forth in STC 82. Specifically, 1. \"Aged/Disabled\" MEG PMPM is multiplied by MEG 1 member months 2. \"TAN F & Rel Grp\" MEG PMPM is multiplied by MEG 2 member months b. Projected PMPM Cost - The PMPM costs for each MEG used to calculate the annual BN expenditure limit for this demonstration is specified below in Table 2. Table 2. PMPM Costs by MEG and Demonstra tion Year Trend the Limit will be Applied. The limits as defined in STCs 97- 99 will apply to the Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 65 of 80 actual expenditures for the demonstration, as reported by the state under Sec tion 95, and specifically, to expenditures reported for the following MEGs: Aged/Disabled, TANF & related grp, CNOM, and PACC CNOM . If at the end of the demonstration period the BN provision has been exceeded, the excess federal f unds will be returned to CMS. There will be no new limit placed on the FFP that the state can claim for expenditures for recipients and program categories not listed. 99. Hypotheticals & Supplemental Budget Neutrality Test 2: MEDS -AD. Optional demonstration e xpenditures that could have been covered via the Medicaid state plan, but instead are provided through section 1115(a) expenditure authority, may be designated as \"hypotheticals\" for the purposes of BN. In these cases, CMS may allow adjustment(s) to the WO W baseline to hold states harmless for the spending which it could have hypothetically provided through the Medicaid state plan. Separate WOW limits are provided below for the costs associated with this demonstration's hypothetical expenditures and, if the limits are exceeded, that excess spending must be \"paid for\" with overall BN savings. a. The MEDS AD MEG listed in Table 3 below is included in the MEDS - AD Supplemental Budget Neutrality Test. Table 3 .1. PMPMs for Supplemental BN Test expenditures cap for the supplemental BN test is calculated by multiplying the projected PMPM for the MEDS AD MEG, each DY, by the number of actual eligible M EDS AD member months for the same/corresponding MEG/DY \u2014and summing the products together across all DYs. The federal share of the MEDS AD expenditure cap is obtained by multiplying this cap by the Composite Federal Share #2 described in STC 104 below. c. If the actual FFP claimed by the state for the MEDS AD MEG for all DYs is greater than the federal share of the MEDS AD expenditure cap defined in sub- STC (b) above, then that overage will be subtracted from the demonstration's overall BN variance. 100. Hypotheti cals & Supplemental Budget Neutrality Test: Behavioral Health and Supportive Housing Assistance Pilot. Optional demonstration expenditures that could have been covered via the Medicaid state plan, but instead are provided through section 1115(a) expenditur e authority, may be designated as \"hypotheticals\" for the purposes of BN. In these cases, CMS may allow adjustment(s) to the WOW baseline to hold states harmless for the spending which it could have hypothetically provided through the Medicaid state plan. Separate WOW limits are provided below for the costs associated Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 66 of 80 with this demonstration's hypothetical expenditures and, if the limits are exceeded, that excess spending must be \"paid for\" with overall BN savings. a. The BH SH Pilot MEG listed in Table 3 .2 below is included in the Behavioral Health and Supportive Housing Assistance Pilot Supplemental Budget Neutrality Test. Table 3. 2. Total Spending for Supplemental BN Test -BH SH Pilot The projected BH SH Pilot for each DY is the amount shown in Table 3.2. The BH SH Pilot expenditures cap is the sum of the annual DY -specific amounts for all DY. The federal share of the BH SH Pilot expenditure cap is obtained by multiplying this cap by the Composite Federal Share #3 described in STC 104 below. c. If the actual FFP claimed by the state for the BH SH Pilot MEG for all DYs is greater than the federal share of the BH SH Pilot expenditure cap defined in sub-STC (b) above, then that overage will be subtracted from the demonstration's overall BN variance. 101. Savings Phase -Out. Each DY, the net variance between the WOW cost and actual WW cost will be reduced for selected population- based MEGs. The reduced variance, to be calculated as a percentage of the total variance, will supersede the total variance in determining overall BN for the demonstration. (Equivalently, the difference between the total variance and reduced variance could be subtracted from the WOW cost estimate.) The f ormula for calculating the reduced variance is: reduced variance equals total variance multiplied by the applicable percentage. The applicable percentages for each MEG and DY are determined based upon length of time the associated population has been enrol led in managed care; lower percentages are associated with longer established managed care populations. The MEGs affected by this provision and the applicable percentages are shown in Table 4 below, except that if the total variance for a MEG in a DY is ne gative, the applicable percentage is 100 percent. Table 4. Savings Phase -Out Percentages DY 15 DY 16 MEG 1 and MEG 2 49% 44% 102. Rebasing. On July 1, 2022, the budget neutrality limits for this demonstration will be rebased consistent with the requiremen ts that are outlined in State Medicaid Director Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 67 of 80 Letter (SMDL ) #18-009 and other CMS guidance. To establish the new PMPMs, the state agrees to utilize its most recent 5 years of complete and contiguous historical expenditure data which was reported in MBES through June 30, 2021. In addition, CMS will recalculate the LIP's UC limits as part of the rebasing process. The rebasing process es described in this STC must be re calculated every 5 years and at each renewal of the demonstration. a. The state must submit a draft budget neutrality workbook with revised PMPMs \u2014 and no more than the most recent 5 years of savings rollover \u2014by March 31, 2022 for the DY 17 rebase and March 31, 2027 for the DY 22 rebase . b. The new PMPMs and UC from the July 1, 2022 rebase will be effe ctive from DY 17 to DY 21. c. The state must repeat the process outlined in this STC in preparation for another rebase to be implemented on July 1, 2027. d. The new PMPMs and UC from the July 1, 2027 rebase will be effective from DY 22 to DY 24. e. Once CMS has ap proved the state's rebasing workbooks, CMS will reissue STCs with updated PMPMs and publish on Medicaid.gov. f. CMS will also update budget neutrality monitoring workbooks in PMDA. 103. Impermissible DSH, Taxes or Donations. CMS reserves the right to adjust the B N ceiling to be consistent with enforcement of impermissible provider payments, health care related taxes, new federal statutes, or policy interpretations implemented throug h state Medicaid Director Letters, other memoranda or regulations. CMS reserves the right to make adjustments to the BN cap if any health care related tax that was in effect during the base year, or provider related donation that occurred during the base year, is determined by CMS to be in violation of the provider donation and health ca re related tax provisions of 1903(w) of the Social Security Act. Adjustments to annual budget targets will reflect the phase out of impermissible provider payments by law or regulation, where applicable. 104. Composite Federal Share Ratio. The federal share of the BN expenditure limit is calculated by multiplying the limit times the Composite Federal Share. The Composite Federal Share is the ratio calculated by dividing the sum total of FFP received by the state on actual demonstration expenditures during the a pproval period, as reported through MBES/CBES and summarized on Schedul e C, with consideration of allowable demonstration offsets such as premium collections, by TC demonstration expenditures for the same period as reported on the same forms. Composite Federal Share #1 is determined by applying the above calculation to expenditures reported under MEG 1 and MEG 2 combined. Composite Federal Share #2 is determined by applying the above calculation to expenditures reported under MEG 4. Composite Federal Share #3 is determined by applying the above calculation to expenditures reported under MEG 8. For the purpose of interim monitoring of BN, a reasonable estimate of Composite Federal Share may be developed and used through the same process or through an alternat ive mutually agreed to method. 105. Enforcement of Budget Neutrality. CMS shall enforce BN over the life of the Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 68 of 80 demonstration. The budget neutrality test for the demonstration extension may incorporate net savings from the immediately pr ior demonstration periods comprising DY 11 through 16 (but not from any earlier approval period). However, no later than 6 months after the end of each DY, the state will calculate an annual expendi ture target for the completed year and report it to CMS as part of the reporting guidelines in Section XVI. This amount will be compared with the actual FFP claimed by the state under BN. Using the schedule in Table 5 below as a guide for the PCCM budget limit, if the state exceeds the cumulative BN expenditure limit, they shall submit a corrective action plan to CMS for approval. The state will subsequently implement the ap proved program. Table 5. Maximum Budget Neutrality Caps Demonstration Year Cumulative Target Definition Percentage DY12 Cumulative B N Limit Plus: 2.0 percent DY13 Cumulative BN Limit Plus: 1.5 percent Cumulative Plus: percent Cumulative Plus: percent Cumulative Plus: percent Cumulative Plus: percent Cumulative Plus: percent Cumulative Plus: percent Cumulative Plus: percent Cumulative Plus: percent Cumulative Plus: percent Cumulative BN Plus: 0.1 percent DY24 Cumulative BN Limit Plu s: 0.0 percent 106. Annual Budget Neutrality Report. On or before June 30, 2021, and on or before June 30 of each year thereafter, the state shall submit to CMS an Annual BN Monitoring Report, which will include an assessment of the demonstration's BN status based on actual expenditures to -date (including complete or nearly complete actual expenditures for the immediately preceding DY), the cumulative BN limit to -date, and updated projections for both the BN limit and WW expenditures through the end of the cur rent approval period. If the state's actual expenditures are found to have exceeded the cumulative BN limit by more than the percentages described in Table 5 above, or if the state's projections indicate that that actual cumulative spending are likely to exceed the BN limit for the approval period, the state must include corrective actions to ensure BN for the demonstration 107. Budget Neutrality Monitoring Tool . The state will provide CMS with quarterly BN status updates via the reporting of demonstration expenditures in the BN Monitoring Tool provided through the Performance Metrics Database and Analytics (PMDA) system. The tool will be jointly developed with the state and incorporate the \"Schedule C Report\" for comparing demonstration's actual expenditures t o the caps which are subject to BN expenditure limits described in STC 93- 94. CMS will provide technical assistance, upon request. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 69 of 80 108. Exceeding Budget Neutrality . If the BN expenditure limit has been exceeded at the end of the demonstration period, the exces s federal funds must be returned to CMS. If the demonstration is terminated prior to the end of the BN agreement, the BN test shall be based on the time elapsed through the termination date. XIX. EVALUATION OF THE DEMONSTRATION 109. Cooperation with Federal E valuators. As required under 42 CFR 431.420(f), the state shall cooperate fully and timely with CMS an d its contractors' in any federal evaluation of the demonstration or any component of the demonstration. This includes, but is not limited to, commenting on design and other federal evaluation docum ents and providing data and analytic files to CMS, including entering into a data use agreement that explains how the data and data files will be exchanged, and providing a technical point of contact to support specification of the data and files to be disclosed, as well as relevant data dictionaries and record layouts. The state shall include in its contracts with entities that collect, produce or maintain data and files for the demonstration, that they shall m ake such data available for the federal evaluation as is required under 42 CFR 431.420(f) to support federal evaluation. The state may claim administrative match for these activities. Failure to comply with this STC may result in a deferral being issued as outlined in STC 70. 110. Independent Evaluator. Upon approval of the demonstration, the state must begin to arrange with an independent party to conduct an evaluation of the demonstration to ensure that the necessary data is collected at the level of detail needed to research the approved hypotheses. The state must require the independent party to sign an agreement that the independent party will conduct the demonstration evaluation in an independent manner in accord with the CMS -approved Evaluation Design. When conducting analyses and developing the evaluation reports, every effort should be made to follow the approved methodology. However, the state may request, and CMS may agree to, changes in the methodology in appropriate circumstances. 111. Draft Evaluat ion Design . The state must submit, for CMS comment and approval, a draft Evaluation Design pertinent to this demonstration extension period, no later than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after the approval of this extension . The draft Evaluation D esign must be developed in accordance with Attachment B (Developing the Evaluation Design) of these STCs , and must include timeline for key evaluation activities including evaluation deliverables , as outlined in STCs 115 and 116. The state may choose to use the expertise of the independent party in the development of the draft Evaluation Design. The draft Evaluation Design must be developed in accordance with the following CMS guidance (including but not limited to): (a) Attachment B (Developing the Evaluation Design) of these STCs, and all applicable technical assistance on applying robust evaluation approaches, including how to establish causal inference and comparison groups in developing Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 70 of 80 a strong Evaluation Design. (b) All applicable E valuation D esign guidance, including guidance about waiver of retroactive eligibility and overall demonstration sustainability. At a minimum, the draft Evaluation Design must include a discussion of the goals, objectives, and specific hypotheses that are being test ed, including those outlined in subparagraphs STC 1 11. The draft design will discuss: i. The outcome measures to be used in evaluating the impact of the demonstration during the period of approval, particularly among the target population; ii. The data sources and sampling methodology for assessing these outcomes; and iii. A detailed analysis plan that describes how the effects of the demonstration are isolated from other initiatives occurring in the state. 112. Evaluation Design Approval and Updates . The state must submi t a revised draft Evaluation Design within sixty (60) calendar days after receipt of CMS' comments. Upon CMS approval of the draft Evaluation Design, the document will be included as an attachment to these STCs. Per 42 CFR 431.424(c), the state will publ ish the approved Evaluation Design within thirty (30) days of CMS approval. The state must implement the Evaluation D esign and submit a description of its evaluation implementation progress in each of the Monitoring Reports . Once CMS approves the E valuat ion D esign, if the state wishes to make changes, the state must submit a revised E valuation D esign to CMS for approval if the changes are substantial in scope; otherwise, in consultation with CMS, the state may include updates to the Evaluation Design in M onitoring Reports . 113. Evaluation Questions and Hypotheses. Consistent with Attachments B and C (Developing the Evaluation Design and Preparing the Evaluation Report s) of these STCs, the evaluation documents must include a discussion of the evaluation questions and hypotheses that the state intends to test. Each demonstration component should have at least one evaluation question and hypothesis. The hypothesis testing should include, where possible, assessment of both process and outcome measures. Proposed measures should be selected from nationally -recognized sources and national measures sets, where possible. Measures sets could include CMS's Core Set of Health Care Quality Measures for Children in Medicaid and CHIP, Consumer Assessment of Health Care Providers and Systems (CAHPS) , the Initial Core Set of Health Care Quality Measures for Medicaid - Eligible Adults and/or measures endorsed by National Quality Forum (NQF). The evaluation must outline and address well -crafted hypotheses and research questions for all of the following demonstration components: a. The effect of managed care on access to care, quality and efficiency of care, and the cost of care; b. The effect of customized benefit plans on beneficiaries' choice of plans, access to care, or quality of care; Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 71 of 80 c. Participation in the Healthy Behaviors programs and its effect on participant behavior or health status; d. The impact of LIP funding on hospital charity care programs; e. The impact of efforts to align with Medicare and improving beneficiary experiences an d outcomes for dual -eligible individuals; f. The effectiveness of enrolling individuals into a managed care plan upon eligibility determination in connecting beneficiaries with care in a timely manner; g. The effect the Statewide Medicaid Prepaid Dental Health Program has on accessibility, quality, utilization, and cost of dental health care services ; h. The impact of the waiver of retroactive eligibility on beneficiaries and providers. Hypotheses for the waiver of retroactive eligibility must relate to (but are not limited to) the following outcomes: likelihood of enrollment and enrollment continuity, enrollment when people are healthy, and health status (as a result of greater enrollment continuity). i. The impact of the behavioral health and supportive housing a ssistance pilot on beneficiaries who are 21 and older with serious mental illness (SMI), substance use disorder (SUD) or SMI with co- occurring SUD, and are homeless or at risk of homelessness due to their disability. j. In addition, the state must investigate cost outcomes for the demonstration as a whole, including but not limited to: administrative costs of demonstration implementation and operation, Medicaid health service expenditures, and provider uncompensated costs. Finally, the state must use results of hypothesis tests and cost analyses to assess demonstration effects on Medicaid program sustainability. The findings from each evaluation component must be integrated to help inform whether the state met the overall demonstration goals, with recommendations for future efforts regarding all components. 114. Evaluation Budget. A budget for the evaluation shall be provided with the draft Evaluation Design. It will include the total estimated cost, as well as a breakdown of estimated staff, administrative and other costs for all aspects of the evaluation such as any survey and measurement development, quantitative and qualitative data collection and cleaning, analyses and report gener ation. A justification of the costs may be required by CMS if the estimates pro vided do not appear to sufficiently cover the costs of the design or if CMS finds that the design is not sufficiently developed , or if the estimates appear to be excessive. 115. Interim Evaluation Report s. The state must submit three Interim Evaluation Report s for the completed years of the demonstration specified in subparagraph c , and for each subsequent renewal or extension of the demonstration, as outlined in 42 CFR 431.412(c)(2)(vi). When submitting an application for renewal, the Evaluation Report should be posted to the state's website with the application for public comment. a. The Interim E valuation R eport s will discuss evaluation progress and Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 72 of 80 present findings to date as per the approved E valuation Design , and address the evaluat ion questions described i n STC 1 13. b. For demonstration authority that expires prior to the overall demonstration's expiration date, the Interim Evaluation Report (s) must include an evaluation of the authority as approved by CMS. c. The state must provide draft Interim Evaluation Repor ts for the corresponding years described below. The state must submit a revised Interim Evaluation Report for each Interim Evaluation Report sixty (60) calendar days after receiving CMS comments on the corresponding draft report . The final version of eac h of the Interim Evaluation Reports must be posted to the state's Medicaid website within thirty ( 30) calendar days of approval by CMS . i. A Draft Interim Evaluation Report for demonstration years 15- 17 (July 1, 2020 - June 30, 2023) will be due no later tha n December 31, 2024. ii. A Draft Interim Evaluation Report for demonstration years 15- 19 (July 1, 2020 - June 30, 2025) will be due no later than December 31, 2026. iii. A Draft Interim Evaluation Report for demonstration years 15- 22 (July 1, 2020 - June 30, 2028) will be due no later than December 31, 2029. d. If the state is seeking to renew or extend the demonstration, the draft Interim Evaluation Report , representing demonstration years 15- 22 (July 1, 2020 - June 30, 2028) is due when the application for renewal is submitted. If the state is not requesting a demonstration extension , the last draft Interim Evaluation R eport , as noted in c(iii) above, is due one (1) year prior to the end of the demonstration. For demonstration phase -outs prior to the expiration of the approval period, the draft Interim Evaluation Report is due to CMS on the date that will be specified in the notice of termination or suspension. e. The Interim Evaluation Report s must comply with Attachment C (Preparing the Evaluation Report s) of these STCs. 116. Summative Evaluation Report. The draft Summative Evaluation Report must be developed in accordance with Attachment C (Preparing the Evaluation Report s) of these STCs. The state must submit a draft Summative Evaluation Report for the demonstration's current approval period by December 31, 2031 (i.e., within 18 months of the end of the approval period represented by these STCs . The Summative Evaluation Report must include the information in the approved Evaluation Design. a. Unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by CMS, the state shall submit the final Summative Evaluation Report within sixty ( 60) calendar days of receiving comments from CMS on the draft . Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 73 of 80 b. The final Summative Evaluation Report must be posted to the state's Medicaid website within thirty (30) calendar days of approval by CMS. 117. Corrective Action Plan Related to Evaluation . If evaluation findings indicate that demonstration features are not likely to assist in promoting the objectives of Medicaid, CMS reserves the right to require the state to submit a corrective action plan to CMS for approval. These discussions may also occur as part of a renewal process when associated with the state's Interim Evaluation Report(s). A state corrective action plan could include a temporary suspension of implementation of demonstration programs, in circumstances where evaluation findings indicate substantial and sustained directional change inconsistent with state targets (such as substantial and sustained trends indicating increased difficulty accessing services, increases in provider uncompensated care costs) . A corrective action plan may be an interim step to withdrawing waivers or expenditure authorities, as outlined in STC 10. CMS would further have the ability to suspend implementation of the demon stration should corrective actions not effectively resolve these concerns in a timely manner. 118. State Presentations for CMS. CMS reserves the right to request that the state present and participate in a discussion with CMS on the Evaluation Design, the Inte rim Evaluation Reports, and/or the Summative Evaluation Report. Presentation may be conducted remotely. 119. Public Access. The State shall post the final documents (e.g., Monitoring Reports, Close Out Report, approved Evaluation Design, Interim Evaluation Re ports, and Summative Evaluation Report) on the state's Medicaid website within thirty ( 30) calendar days of approval by CMS. 120. Additional Publications and Presentations. For a period of twelve (12) months following CMS approval of the final reports, CMS wil l be notified prior to presentation of these reports or their findings, including in related publications (including, for example, journal articles), by the state , contractor, or any other third party directly connected to the demonstration over which the state has control . Prior to release of these reports, articles or other publications, CMS will be provided a copy including any associated press materials. CMS will be given ten (10) business days to review and comment on publications before they are rel eased. CMS may choose to decline to comment or review some or all o f these notifications and reviews. This requirement does not apply to the release or presentation of these materials to state or local government officials. XX. MEASUREMENT OF QUALITY OF CARE AND ACCESS TO CARE IMPROVEMENT 121. External Quality Review (EQR). The state is required to meet all requirements for external quality review (EQR) found in 42 CFR Part 438, subpart E. In addition to routine encounter data validation processes that take place at the MCO/PIHP and state level, the state must maintain its contract with its external quality review organization (EQRO) to Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 74 of 80 require the independent annual validation of encounter data for all MCOs and PIHPs. 122. Consumer Health Plan Report Cards. On a n annual basis, the state must create and make readily available to beneficiaries, providers, and other interested stakeholders, a health plan report card, in a format compliant with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794d), that is based on performance data on each managed care plan included in the annual EQR technical report. Each health plan report card must be posted on the state's website and present an easily understandable summary of quality, access, and timeliness regarding the perfo rmance of each participating plan. The report cards must also address the performance of subcontracted dental plans. 123. Performance Improvement Projects (PIP). In accordance with 42 CFR \u00a7438.330, the state must require each managed care plan, including each dental plan, to commit to improving care. In lieu of Performance Improvement Projects (PIPs) identified by CMS as described in \u00a7 438.330(a)(2), the state must require each managed care plan, including each dental plan to complete PIPs in the following focus areas, which have the significant potential for achieving the demonstration's goals of improving patient care, population health, and reducing per capita Medicaid expenditure. Specialty plans that do not have sufficient numbers of eligible recipients for the PIP topics identified in 126(a) or 126(b) may conduct alternative PIPs on topics more relevant to their enrolled population in place of the required focus areas, subject to approval by the state. a. A PIP combining a focus on improving primary C -section rates, pre- term delivery rates, and neonatal abstinence syndrome rates; b. A PIP focused on reducing potentially preventable events, including hospital admissions, readmissions, and emergency department visits; c. An administrative PIP focusing on the administr ation of the transportation benefit, specifically focusing on the rate of trips resulting in the enrollee arriving to their scheduled appointment on time; and d. A PIP focused on improving follow -up after hospitalizations for mental illness, emergency departm ent visits for mental illness, and emergency department visits for alcohol and other drug abuse or dependence . e. Dental plans shall perform three PIPs as follows: i. A PIP focused on increasing the rate of enrollees accessing preventive dental services; ii. A PIP f ocused on reducing potentially preventable dental -related emergency department visits in collaboration with the Statewide Medicaid Managed Care (SMMC) plans. iii. An administrative PIP focused on coordination of transportation services with the SMMC plans. f. The state must conduct each PIP in accordance with 42 CFR \u00a7438.330 and 438.340. The state will meet its obligations under the regulations. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 75 of 80 124. Measurement Activities. The state must ensure that each participating managed care plan is accountable for metrics on quality and access, including measures to track progress in identified quality improvement focus areas, measures to track quality broadly, and measures to track access. The state must set performance tar gets that equal or exceed the 75th percentile national Medicaid performance level. In addition to requirements set forth at 42 CFR \u00a7 438.330 through 438.334, the state mus t collect data and information on dental care utilization rates, the CMS Medicaid and CHIP adult and child core measures, and must align with other existing federal measure sets where possible to en sure ongoing monitoring of individual well -being and plan performance. The state will use this information in ongoing monitoring and quality improvement efforts, in addition to quality reporting efforts.

The state implemented the demonstration July 1, 2006, in Broward and Duval Counties, and then expanded to Baker, Clay, and Nassau Counties July 1, 2007. On December 15, 2011, CMS agreed to ex tend the demonstration through June 30, 2014. The December 2011 renewal included several important improvements to the demonstration, such as; enhanced managed care requirements to ensure increased stability among managed care plans, minimize plan turnove r, and provide for an improved transition and continuity of care when enrollees change plans and to ensure adequate choice of providers. The renewal also included a Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) requirement of 85 percent for Medicaid operations. Finally, the re newal included the continuation of the Low Income Pool (LIP) of $1 billion (TC) annually to assist safety net providers in providing health care services to Medicaid, underinsured and uninsured populati ons. On June 14, 2013, CMS approved an amendment to t he demonstration, which retains all of the improvements noted above, but allowed the state to extend an improved model of managed care to all counties in Florida subject to approval of an implementation plan and a determination of readiness based on the el ements of the approved plan. The amendment also changed the name of the demonstration to the Florida Managed Medical Assistance (MMA) program. CMS authorized implementation to begin no earlier than January 1, 2014, with the Medicaid Reform demonstration c ontinuing to operate in the five Medicaid Reform counties until the MMA program was implemented there. Under the June 2013 amended demonstration, most Medicaid eligibles were required to enroll in a managed care plan (either a capitated managed care plan or a FFS Provider Service Network (PSN)) as a condition for receiving Medicaid. Enrollment was mandatory for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) -related populations and the aged and disabled, with some exceptions. The demonstration continued to allow plans to offer customized benefit packages and reduced cost sharing, although each plan must cover all mandatory services, and all state plan services for children and pregnant women (including Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT)). The demonstration provided incentives for healthy behaviors by offering Enhanced Benefits Accounts that were replaced by the plan's Healthy Behaviors program upon implementation of the MMA program as described in STC 54. Beneficiaries in counties transitioning from Medicaid Reform to MMA continued to have access to their accrued credits under Enhanced Benefit Account Program (EBAP) for one year. The June 2013 amended terms and conditions included improvements such as: A phased implementation to ensure readiness including a readiness assessment for each region and a requirement for CMS approval of the state's implementation plan which will include identified r isks, mitigation strategies, fail safes, stakeholder engagement Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 78 of 93 and rapid cycle improveme nt strategies; Strengthened auto -enrollment criteria to ensure consideration of network capacity, access, continuity of care, and preservation of existing patient -provider relationships when enrolling all beneficiaries into the MMA program, including spec ial populations; STCs tailored to special populations, should the state choose to include specialty plans in the final selection of managed care entities and PSNs; Strong consumer protections to ensure beneficiary assistance and continuity of care through the MMA transition. Additional STCs to ensure beneficiary choice, including a comprehensive outreach plan to educate and communicate with beneficiaries, providers, and stakeholders and annual Health Plan Report Cards for consumers, which will allow benefic iaries to be more informed on health plan performance and assist beneficiaries in making informed decisions related to plan selection; Enhanced Medical Care Advisory Committee (MCAC) requirements to ensure beneficiary and advocate group participation as we ll as inclusion of sub- population advisory committees; Performance Improvement Projects (PIP) to be performed by all health plans; Clarification and enhancements of the monitoring and evaluation of plans to ensure a rigorous and independent evaluation, and development of rapid cycle, transparent monitoring in order to ensure continuous progress towards quality improvement; and, A Comprehensive Quality Strategy (CQS) that will span the entire Florida Medicaid program. The approved 2014 extension of the demonstration continued the improvements authorized in the June 2013 amendment and extended all portions of this demonstration for three years, except for the Low Income Pool (LIP). CMS authorized extension of the Low Income Pool for one year, from July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2015. During the one -year extension for the LIP, expenditures were authorized to provide stability for providers for a limited time during Florida's transition to statewide Medicaid managed care and a significantly reformed Medicaid pay ment system. Funding sources were limited only to existing state and local funding arrangements. The total amount of LIP funding could not exceed $2,167,718,341 (TC). Florida was required to analyze and develop a plan to reform Medicaid provider payments a nd funding mechanisms, with the goal of developing sustainable, transparent, equitable, appropriate, accountable, and actuarially sound Medicaid payment systems and funding mechanisms that ensure quality health care services to Florida's Medicaid beneficiaries throughout the state without the need for LIP funding. Expenditures authorized under the LIP were limited to UC costs of providers, the independent report discussed below, and other categories of expenditure as specified in the STCs. UC costs were req uired to be verified through provider cost reports. CMS indicated that it would disallow unallowable payments to providers in prior DYs as identified on provider cost reports. During the one -year LIP extension, the state was required to use a portion of the LIP Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 79 of 93 funds to commission a report from an independent entity on Medicaid provider payment in the state that reviews the adequacy of payment levels, and the adequacy, equity, accountability and sustainability of the State's funding mechanisms for these payments. The report was required to recommend reforms to the Florida Medicaid financing system that can allow the state, beginning in state fiscal year (SFY) 2015 -2016, to move toward Medicaid FFS and managed care payments that ensure access for Medicaid beneficiaries to providers without payments through the LIP. The final report was due no later than March 1, 2015. On June 30, 2015, pursuant to a letter to the state, CMS granted 60 days of interim expenditure authority under section 1115(a)(2) of the Soci al Security Act, to make federal funding available to Florida for interim LIP payments to providers from July 1, 2015 through August 31, 2015 of DY (DY) 10, subject to a total spending limit of $166.66 million for the combined federal and state shares of e xpenditures (with such amount being counted in determining the amount of any further extension of the Low Income Pool). On October 15, 2015, CMS approved three amendments to the demonstration. The first amendment added two populations as voluntary enroll ees in managed care: Medicaid -eligible children receiving Prescribed Pediatric Extended Care (PPEC) services, and recipients residing in group home facilities licensed under section(s) 393.067 Florida Statutes (FS). The second amendment authorized changes to managed care enrollment to auto- assign individuals into managed care during a plan choice period immediately after eligibility determination. The amendment also changes the auto -assignment criteria. Individuals will receive both their managed care plan assignment and information about choice of plans in their area. Individuals may actively select a plan during a 120-day change/disenrollment period post-enrollment. The third amendment authorized expenditures under the LIP through June 30, 2017. The total amount of LIP funding in DY 10 (July 1, 2015 - June 30, 2016) will not exceed $1 billion (TC). The total amount of LIP funding in DY 11 (July 1, 2016 - June 30, 2017) will not exceed $607,825,452 million (TC). The changes represent a transition to a LIP that reflects the cost to providers of UC for uninsured individuals in the state, and that no longer pays for care that may be or has been provided through available coverage options. The changes set Florida on a path to administering a LIP in 2016- 2017 (DY 11) that distributes funds based on the burden placed on providers by services for low - income, uninsured individuals for whom no other coverage options are, or could be, made available. On October 12, 2016, CMS approved three amendments, which modified t he demonstration to: (a) allow Florida flexibility to contract with one to three ve ndors under the hemophilia program; (b) Include payments for nursing facility (NF) services in MMA capitation rates for recipients under the age of 18 years; and (c) allow flexibili ty for specialt y plans to conduct Perfo rmance Improvement Projects (PIP) on topics that have more specific impacts to their Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 80 of 93 enrollees, with Florida approval.11 Under the demonstration, Florida seeks to continue building on the following objectives: Improving outcomes through care coordination, patient engagement in their own health care, and maintaining fiscal responsibility. The demonstration seeks to improve care for Medicaid beneficiaries by providing care through nationally accredited managed care plan s with broad networks, expansive benefits packages, top quality scores, and high rate of customer satisfaction. The state will provide oversight focused on improving access and increasing quality of care. Improving program performance, particularly improve d scores on nationally recognized quality measures (such as HEDIS scores), through expanding key components of the Medicaid managed care program statewide and competitively procuring plans on a regional basis to stabilize plan participation and enhance continuity of care. A key objective of improved program performance is to increase patient satisfaction. Improving access to coordinated care by enrolling all Medicaid enrollees in managed care except those specifically exempted due to short -term eligibility, limited service eligibility, or institutional placement (other than nursing home care). Increasing access to, stabilizing, and strengthening providers that serve uninsured, low- income populations in the state by targeting LIP funding to reimburse UC cost s for services provided to low -income uninsured patients at hospitals that are furnished through charity care programs that adhere to the (HFMA) principles.12 On August 1, 2017, CMS reauthorized the MMA Medicaid managed care program for the 5- year extensio n without significant changes to the program. The revised STCs for the extension reflected the state's obligation to follow the Medicaid managed care regulations at 42 CFR 438, and CMS and Florida agreed to several revisions to the STCs that previously governed the state's LIP. The revised LIP calculations reflected in the extension STCs led to a new TC annual LIP limit of $1.5 billion per DY \u2014which was an annual increase of approximately $900 million compared to the previous DY's LIP amount. There were two changes which led to the increased annual LIP limit: CMS' analysis of more recent Florida hospital cost report data led to an increase of $450 million in annual LIP; and CMS did not apply the previous LIP reduction for Medicaid expansion which led to an additional increase of $450 million annually \u2014this was the only significant change to CMS' previous methodology for determining UC amounts. Consistent with CMS' goal of lessening or removing unduly burdensome and/or duplicative state reporting requirements , where appropriate, the extension STCs also omitted the requirement for quarterly reporting on all MMA demonstration activities (although 11 For the \"Comprehensive Program Description and Objectives,\" see Attachment B. 12 http://www.hfma.org/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=14589 Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 81 of 93 expenditures continue to be reported quarterly, and annual reporting is required, consistent with the statutory requi rement of periodic state reports). In addition, the requirement for the state to submit the LIP Reimbursement and Funding Methodology (RFMD) document for the first extension DY \u2014with subsequent annual attestations that the methodology remains in effect. CM S also eliminated the requirement for a Comprehensive Quality Strategy in the extension; however, the state still is required to develop and maintain a managed care quality strategy as required under 42 CFR \u00a7438.340.

The evaluations of new initiatives seek to produce new knowledge and direction for programs and inform Medicaid policy for the future. While a narrative about what happened during a demonstration provides important information, the principal focus of the evaluation of a section 1115 demonstration should be obtaining and analyzing data on the process (e.g., whether the demonstration is being implemented as intended), outcomes (e.g., whether the demonstration is having the intended effects on the target population), and impacts of the demonstration (e.g., whether the outcomes observed in the targeted population differ from outcomes in similar populations not affected by the demonstration). Both state and federal governments need rigorous quantitative and qualitative evidence to inform policy decisions. CMS expects evaluation designs to be rigorous, incorporate baseline and comparison group assessments, as well as statistical si gnificance testing. Technical assistance resources for constructing comparison groups, identifying causal inferences, phasing implementation to support evaluation, and designing and administering beneficiary surveys are available on Medicaid.gov: https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/section -1115- demo/evaluation- reports/evaluation- designs -and-reports/index.html. If the state needs additional technical assistance using this outline or developing the evaluation design, the state should contact the demonstratio n team. Expectations for Evaluation Designs All states with Medicaid section 1115 demonstrations are required to conduct an evaluation, and the Evaluation Design is the roadmap for conducting the evaluation. The roadmap begins with the stated goals for the demonstration followed by the measurable evaluation questions and quantifiable hypotheses, all to support a determination of the extent to which the demonstration has achieved its goals. W hen conducting analyses and developing the evaluation reports, every effort should be made to follow the approved methodology. However, the state may request, and CMS may agree to, changes in the methodology in appropriate circumstances The format for the Evaluation Design is as follows: A. General Background Informa tion; B. Evaluation Questions and Hypotheses; C. Methodology; D. Methodological Limitations; E. Attachments. Submission Timelines Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 83 of 93 There is a specified timeline for the state's submission of Evaluation Desig n and Reports. (The graphic below depicts an example of a deliverables timeline for a 5 -year demonstration). In addition, the state should be aware that section 1115 evaluation documents are public records. The state is required to publish the Evaluation Design to the state's website within thirty ( 30) calendar days of CMS approval, as per 42 CFR 431.424(e). CMS will also publish a copy to the Medicaid.gov website. Required Core Components of All Evaluation Designs The Evaluation Design sets the stage for the Interim and Summative Evaluation Reports. It is important that the Evaluation Design explain the goals and objectives of the demonstration, the hypotheses related to the demonstration, and the methodology (and limitations) for the evaluation. A copy of the S tate's Driver Diagram (described in more detail in paragraph B2 below) should be included with an explanation of the depicted information. A. General Background Information - In this section, the state should include basic information about the demonstration, such as: 1. The issue/s that the state is tryin g to address with its section 1115 demonstration and/or expenditure authorities, the potential magnitude of the issue/s, and why the state selected this course of action to address the issue/s (e. g., a narrative on why the state submitted an 1115 demonstra tion proposal). 2. The name of the demonstration, approval date of the demonstration, and period of time covered by the evaluation; 3. A brief description of the demonstration and history of the implementation, and whether the draft Evaluation Design applies t o an amendment, extension, renewal, or expansion of, the demonstration; 4. For renewals, amendments, and major operational changes: A description of any changes to the demonstration during the approval period; the primary reason or reasons for the change; an d how the Evaluation Design was altered or augmented to address these changes. 5. Describe the population groups impacted by the demonstration. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 84 of 93 B. Evaluation Questions and Hypotheses - In this section , the state should: 1. Describe how the state's demonstration goals are translated into quantifiable targets for improvement, so that the performance of the demonstration in achieving these targets could be measured. 2. Include a Driver Diagram to visually aid readers in understanding the rationale behind the cause and effect of the variants behind the demonstration features and intended outcomes. A driver diagram is a particularly effective modeling tool when working to improve health and health care through specific interventions. The diagram includes information about the goal of the demonstration, and the features of the demonstration. A driver diagram depicts the relationship between the aim, the primary drivers that contribute directly to achieving the aim, and the secondary drivers that are necessary to achieve the primary drivers for the demonstration. For an example and more information on driver diagrams: https://innovation.cms.gov/files/x/hciatwoaimsdrvrs.pdf 3. Identify the state's hypot heses about the outcomes of the demonstration: a. Discuss how the evaluation questions align with the hypotheses and the goals of the demonstration; b. Address how the research questions / hypotheses of this demonstration promote the objectives of Titles XIX and/or XXI. C. Methodology - In this section, the state is to describe in d etail the proposed research methodology. The focus is on showing that the evaluation meets the prevailing standards of scientific and academic rigor, and the results are statistically v alid and reliable, and that where appropriate it builds upon other published research (use references). This section provides the evidence that the demonstration evaluation will use the best available data; reports on, controls for, and makes appropriate adjustments for the limitations of the data and their effects on results; and discusses the generalizability of results. This section should provide enough transparency to explain what will be measured and how. Specifically, this section establishes: 1.

Include the measure stewards (i.e., the organization(s) responsible for the evaluation data elements/sets by \"owning\", defining, validating; securing; and submitting for endorsement, etc.) Includ e numerator and denominator information. Additional items to ensure: a. The measures contain assessments of both process and outcomes to evaluate the effects of the demonstration during the period of approval. b. Qualitative analysis methods may be used, and mus t be described in detail. c. Benchmarking and comparisons to national and state standards should be used, where appropriate. d. Proposed health measures could include CMS's Core Set of Health Care Quality Measures for Children in Medicaid and CHIP, Consumer Asse ssment of Health Care Providers and Systems (CAHPS), the Initial Core Set of Health Care Quality Measures for Medicaid -Eligible Adults and/or measures endorsed by National Quality Forum (NQF). e. Proposed performance metrics can be selected from nationally re cognized metrics, for example from sets developed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation or for meaningful use under Health Information Technology (HIT). f. Among considerations in selecting the metrics shall be opportunities identified by the sta te for improving quality of care and health outcomes, and controlling cost of care. 5.

Methodological Limitations - This section provides detailed information on the limitations of the evaluation. This could include the design, the data sources or collection process, or analytic methods. The state should also identify any efforts to minimize the limitations. Additionally, this section should include any information about features of the demonstration that effectively present methodolog ical constra ints that the state would like CMS to take into consideration in its review. E. Special Methodological Considerations - CMS recognizes that there may be certain instances where a state cannot meet the rigor of an evaluation as expected by CMS. In these instances, the state should document for CMS why it is not able to incorporate key components of a rigorous evaluation, including comparison groups and baseline data analyses. Examples of considerations include: 1. When the state demonstration is: a. Long -standing, non -complex, unchanged, or b. Has previously been rigorously evaluated and found to be successful, or c. Could now be considered standard Medicaid policy (CMS published regulations or guidance) 2. When the demonstration is also considered successful without issues or concerns that would require more regular reporting, such as: a. Operating smoothly without administrative changes; and Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 88 of 93 b. No or minimal appeals and grievances; and c. No state issues with CMS 64 reporting or BN; and d. No Corrective Action Plans (C AP) for the demonstration. F. Attachments 1. Independent Evaluator. This includes a discussion of the state's process for obtaining an independent entity to conduct the evaluation, including a description of the qualifications that the selected entity must possess, and how the state will assure no conflict of interest. Explain how the state will assure that the Independent Evaluator will conduct a fair and impartial evaluation, prepare an objective Evaluation Report, and that there would be no conflict of interest. The Evaluation D esign should include a \"No Conflict of Interest\" statement signed by the independent evaluator. 2. Evaluation Budget. A budget for implementing the evaluation shall be provided with the draft Evaluation Design. It will include th e total estimated cost, as well as a breakdown of estimated staff, administrative, and other costs for all aspects of the evaluation. Examples include, but are not limited to, the development of all survey and measurement instruments; quantitative and qua litative data collection; data cleaning and analyses; and reports generation. A justification of the costs may be required by CMS if the estimates provided do not appear to sufficiently cover the costs of the draft Evaluation Design, if CMS finds that the draft Evaluation Design is not sufficiently developed , or if the estimates appear to be excessive. 3. Timeline and Major Milestones. Describe the timeline for conducting the various evaluation activities, including dates for evaluation- related milestones, including those related to procurement of an outside contractor, if applicable, and deliverables. The Final Evaluation Design shall incorporate the Interim Evaluation Reports and Summative Evaluation. Pursuant to 42 CFR 431.424(c)(v), this timeline should also include the date by which the Final Summative Evaluation report is due. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 89 of 93 ATTACHMENT C PREPARING THE EVALUATION REPORT S Introduction For states that are testing new approaches and flexibilities in their Medicaid programs through section 1115 demons trations, evaluations are crucial to understand and disseminate what is or is not working and why. The evaluations of new initiatives seek to produce new knowledge and direction for programs and inform Medicaid policy for the future. While a narrative ab out what happened during a demonstration provide important information, the principal focus of the evaluation of a section 1115 demonstration should be obtaining and analyzing data on the process (e.g., whether the demonstration is being implemented as int ended), outcomes (e.g., whether the demonstration is having the intended effects on the target population), and impacts of the demonstration (e.g., w hether the outcomes observed in the targeted population differ from outcomes in similar populations not aff ected by the demonstration). Both state and federal governments need rigorous quantitative and qualitative evidence to inform policy decisions. Expectations for Evaluation Reports Medicaid section 1115 demonstrations are required to conduct evaluations that are valid (the extent to which the evaluation measures what it is intended to measure), and reliable (the extent to which the evalu ation could produce the same results when used repeatedly). To this end, the already -approved Evaluation Design is a map that begins with the demonstration goals, then transitions to the evaluation questions, and to the specific hypotheses, which will be used to investigate whether the demonstration has achieved its goals. States should have a well- structured analysis pla n for their evaluation. With the following kind of information, states and CMS are best poised to inform and shape Medicaid policy in order to improve the health and welfare of Medicaid beneficiaries for decades to come. When conducting analyses and deve loping the evaluation reports, every effort should be made to follow the approved methodology. However, the state may request, and CMS may agree to, changes in the methodology in appropriate circumstances . When submitting an application for renewal, the final I nterim E valuation Report should be posted on the state's website with the application for public comment. Additionally, the Interim E valuation R eport s must be included in their entirety with the application submitted to CMS. Intent of this Attachment Title XIX of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires an evaluation of every section 1115 demonstration. In order to fulfill this requirement, the state's submission must provide a comprehensive written presentation of all key components of the demonstration, and include all required elements specified in the approved Evaluation Design. This Attachment is intended to assist states with organizing the required information in a standardized format and understanding the criteria that CMS will use in re viewing the submitted Interim and Summative Evaluation Reports. The format for the Interim and Summative Evaluation reports are as follows: A. Executive Summary; B. General Background Information; Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 90 of 93 C. Evaluation Questions an d Hypotheses; D. Methodology; E. Methodologica l Limitations; F. Results; G. Conclusions; H. Interpretations, and Policy Implications and Interactions with Other State Initiatives; I. Lessons Learned and Recommendations; and J. Attachment(s). Submission Timelines There is a specified timeline for the state's submiss ion of Evaluation Designs and Evaluation Reports. These dates are specified in the demo nstration Special Terms and Conditions (STCs). (The graphic below depicts an example of a deliverables timeline for a 5 -year demonstration). In addition, the state should be aware that section 1115 evaluation documents are public recor ds. In order to assure the dissemination of the evaluation findings, lessons learned, and recommendations, the state is required to publish the E valuation D esign and reports to the state' s website within 30 calendar days of CMS approval, as per 42 CFR 431.424(d). CMS will also publish a copy to the Medicaid.gov website. Required Core Components of Interim and Summative Evaluation Reports The section 1115 Evaluation Report s present the research about the section 1115 Demonstration. It is important that the report incorporate a discussion about the structure of the Evaluation Design to explain the goals and objectives of the demonstration, the hypotheses related to the demonstration, and the methodology for the evaluation. A copy of the S tate's Driver Diagram (described in the Evaluation Design Attachment) must be included with an explanation of the depicted information. The Evaluation Report s should present the relevant data and an in terpretation of the findings; assess the outcomes (what worked and what did not work); explain the limitations of the design, data, and anal yses; offer recommendations regarding what (in hindsight) the state would further advance, or do differently, and wh y; and discuss the implications on future Medicaid policy. Therefore, the state's submission must include: A. Executive Summary - A summary of the demonstration, the principal Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 91 of 93 results, interpretations, and recommendations of the evaluation. B. General Backgro und Information about the Demonstration - In this section, the state should include basic information about the demonstration, such as: 1) The issues that the state is trying to address with its section 1115 demonstration and/or expenditure authorities, how the state became aware of the issue, the potential magnitude of the issue, and why the state selected this course of action to address the issues. 2) The name of the demonstration, approval date of the demonstration, and period of time covered by the evaluat ion; 3) A brief description of the demonstration and history of the implementation, and if the evaluation is for an amendment, extension, renewal, or expansion of, the demonstration; 4) For renewals, amendments, and major operational changes: A description of any changes to the demonstration during the approval period; whether the motivation for change was due to political, economic, and fiscal factors at the state and/or federal level; whether the programmatic changes were implemented to improve beneficiary he alth, provider/health plan performance, or administrative efficiency; and how the Evaluation Design was altered or augmented to address these changes. 5) Describe the population groups impacted by the demonstration. C. Evaluation Questions and Hypotheses - In this section, the state should: 1) Describe how the state's demonstration goals were translated into quantifiable targets for improvement, so that the performance of the demonstration in achieving these targets could be measured. The inclusion of a Driver D iagram in the Evaluation Report is highly encouraged, as the visual can aid readers in understanding the rationale behind the demonstration features and intended outcomes. 2) Identify the state's hypotheses about the outcomes of the demonstration: a. Discuss h ow the goals of the demonstration align with the evaluation questions and hypotheses; b. Explain how this Evaluation Report builds upon and expands earlier demonstration evaluation findings (if applicable); and c. Address how the research questions / hypotheses of this demonstration promote the objectives of Titles XIX and XXI. D. Methodology - In this section, the state is to provide an overview of the research Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 92 of 93 that was conducted to evaluate the section 1115 demonstration consistent with the approved Evaluation De sign. The E valuation Design should also be included as an attachment to the report. The focus is on showing that the evaluation builds upon other published research (use references), and meets the prevailing standards of scientific and academic rigor, an d the results are statistically valid and reliable. The interim reports should provide any available data to date, including both quantitative and qualitative assessments. The Evaluation Design should assure there is appropriate data development and col lection in a timely manner to support developing interim evaluation s. This section provides the evidence that the demonstration evaluation used the best available data and describes why potential alternative data sources were not used; reported on, control led for, and made appropriate adjustments for the limitations of the data and their effects on results; and discusses the generalizability of results. This section should provide enough transparency to explain what was measured and how. Specifically, this section establishes that the approved Evaluation Design was followed by describing: 1) Evaluation Design\u2014Will the evaluation be an assessment of: pre/post, post - only, with or without comparison groups, etc.? 2) Target and Comparison Populations \u2014Describe the target and comparison populations; include inclusion and exclusion criteria. 3) Evaluation Period\u2014 Describe the time periods for which data will be collected . 4) Evaluation Measures \u2014What measures are used to evaluate the demonstration, and who are the measure stewards? 5) Data Sources \u2014Explain where the data will be obtained, and efforts to validate and clean the data. 6) Analytic methods \u2014Identify specific statistical testing which will be undertaken for each measure (t -tests, chi -square, odds ratio, ANOVA, regression, etc.). 7) Other Additions - The state may provide any other information pertinent to the evaluation of the demonstration. E. Methodological Limitations This section provides sufficient information for discerning the strengths and weaknesses of the study desig n, data sources/collection, and analyses. F. Results - In this section, the state presents and uses the quantitative and qualitative data to show to whether and to what degree the evaluation questions and hypotheses of the demonstration were achieved. The f indings should visually depict the Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 1 5, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Page 93 of 93 demonstration results (tables, charts, graphs). This section should include information on the statistical tests conducted. G. Conclusions - In this section, the state will present the conclusions about the evaluation resu lts. 1) In general, did the results show that the demonstration was/was not effective in achieving the goals and objectives established at the beginning of the demonstration? 2) Based on the findings, discuss the outcomes and impacts of the demonstration and i dentify the opportunities for improvements. Specifically: a. If the state did not fully achieve its intended goals, why not? What could be done in the future that would better enable such an effort to more fully achieve those purposes, aims, objectives, and goals? H. Interpretations, Policy Implications and Interactions with Other State Initiatives - In this section, the state will discuss the section 1115 demonstration within an overall Medicaid context and long range planning. This should include interrelatio ns of the demonstration with other aspects of the state's Medicaid program, interactions with other Medicaid demonstrations, and other federal awards affecting service delivery, health outcomes and the cost of care under Medicaid. This section provides the state with an opportunity to provide interpretation of the data using evaluative reasoning to make judgments about the demonstration. This section should also include a discussion of the implications of the findings at both the state and national levels . I. Lessons Learned and Recommendations - This section of the Evaluation Report involves the transfer of knowledge. Specifically, the \"opportunities\" for future or revised demonstrations to inform Medicaid policymakers, advocates, and stakeholders is just a s significant as identifying current successful strategies. Based on the evaluation results: 1) What lessons were learned as a result of the demonstration? 2) What would you recommend to other states, which may be interested in implementing a similar approach?
