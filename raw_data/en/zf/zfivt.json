By incorporating simple habits into your life, you can kickstart your wellness journey and stay on track for the long run. Schedule a wellness exam Seeing your [primary care](/medical-services/service-lines/primary-care) provider at least once a year is the single most important thing you can do for your health. At your [annual exam](/medical-services/diagnostics/screenings), your physician will help keep you healthy and reach your wellness goals. They screen for diseases to stay ahead of medical issues and check in on your overall well-being. Set a reminder on your phone or calendar to prompt you to [book an appointment](/physicians?keyword=primary%2Bcare&v=1). You can also use an important date, such as your birthday, anniversary or holiday, as a marker to remind you to schedule a visit. Get moving to stay well If you're focused on improving your fitness routine, put a plan in place to be more active and drop the extra pounds. According to Wellstar Internal Medicine Physician [Dr. Asher Niazi](/physicians/asher-niazi-md), consistency is key to succeed. \"Raise your heart rate 45 minutes a day, at least five to six days a week,\" Dr. Niazi said, stressing the importance of regular activity. \"You don't have to go in gym and spend two hours working out. Exercise can be as simple as going on a brisk walk.\" For those looking to slim down, your healthcare provider can help jumpstart your health journey with a tailored diet and exercise plan. Set a sleep routine Having a bedtime routine is essential to catch more Z's over the year. When you wake up feeling rested, you often feel more productive and energized throughout the day. Get started by setting a specific time to go to sleep \u2014 and sticking to it. Make sure you reserve at least seven to nine hours per night for sleep. Limit your screen time before getting in bed. Bright screens from a phone, computer or TV can keep your brain awake and make it harder to fall asleep. If you're having trouble getting to sleep, have a decaffeinated cup of tea or take a warm bath to help you relax. Eat a balanced diet When it comes to losing weight, many people look for a \"quick fix\" which can often create unhealthy ways of eating. Creating a healthy eating plan from the start can help avoid any fad diet pitfalls. Nutrition plans that restrict or eliminate food groups, and those with extreme calorie deficits are difficult to maintain and can often produce more weight gain or undesired results, according to Wellstar Registered Dietitian Kelly Prian. Diet trends can also create a negative relationship with food, which can make it harder to achieve your goals. Kelly Prian shared that those with long-term success focus on maintaining a plan that enables steady weight loss over time. A healthy nutrition plan is balanced and emphasizes on whole foods, such as fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, low fat dairy, nuts and seeds, and whole grains. Try not to overcomplicate healthy eating. Focus on starting with small changes like filling half your plate with vegetables, or have fun trying new recipes. Take care of your mental health Self-care is an important aspect of your mental well-being, and should be made a consistent part of each day. \"Make self-care a priority and a non-negotiable,\" said Dr. Rebecca Gomez, Wellstar clinical health psychologist and Clinician Resiliency & Well-Being Program Lead. \"Think of self-care as a form of personal healing and a way to strengthen resilience,\" Dr. Gomez explained. \"Much like the way exercise enhances physical health, self-care enhances mental health.\" According to Dr. Gomez, even small acts of intention can turn tasks we do on \"autopilot\" into more meaningful experiences. \"When washing your hands, give yourself a hand massage,\" Dr. Gomez shared. \"When driving, use red lights to practice deep breathing. Listen to a book on tape or language lessons rather than the radio, or call someone to reconnect.\" If you feel overwhelmed by stress or anxiety, Wellstar's [behavioral health](/medical-services/service-lines/behavioral-health) specialists are here for you. \"Working with a mental health provider is different than speaking with a friend, or even a 'life coach,'\" Dr. Gomez said. \"Mental health professionals are trained and licensed to address psychological or emotional wellness.\" Need support?
