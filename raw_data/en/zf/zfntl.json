Methods: An advisory panel of clinicians and research experts in women 's health were selected to review and evaluate the literature published since the Nonhormonal Managemen t of Menopause-Associated Vasomotor Symptoms: 2015 Po- sition Statement of The North American Menopause Society. Topics were divided into five sections for ease of review:lifestyle; mind-body techniques; prescription therapies; dietary supplements; and acupuncture, other treatments, andtechnologies. The panel assessed the most current and available literature to determine whether to recommend or notrecommend use based on these levels of evidence: Level I, good and consistent scientific evidence; Level II, limitedor inconsistent scientific evidence, and Level III, consensus and expert opinion. Results: Evidence-based review of the literature resulted in several nonhormone options for the treatment of vasomo- tor symptoms. Recommended : Cognitive-behavioral therapy, ganglion II-III). Not recommended : Paced respiration (Level I); supplements/herbal remedies (Levels I-II); cooling techniques, avoiding triggers, exercise, yoga, mindfulness-based intervention, relaxation,suvorexant, soy foods and soy extracts, soy cannabinoids, calibration (Levels I-III); dietary modification and pregabalin (Level III). Conclusion: Hormone therapy remains the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms and should be consid- ered in menopausal women within 10 years of their final menstrual periods. For women who are not good candidates for hormone therapy because of contraindications (eg, estrogen-dependent cancers or cardiovascular disease) or personalpreference, it is important for healthcare professionals to be well informed about nonhormone treatment options for re-ducing vasomotor symptoms that are supported by the evidence. Key Words: Clinical hypnosis -Cognitive-behavioral - symptoms. Hot flashes and night sweats (vasomotor symptoms [VMS]) are the most common symptoms of menopause and oc-cur in up to 80% of menopausal women. 1Vasomotorsymptoms can be bothersome, lasting a mean duration of 7 to 9 years, and in one-third of women, can last more than 10 years.2 Hormone therapy (HT) remains the most effective treatment and should be considered in menopausal women aged younger than60 years, within 10 years of their final menstrual periods, andwithout contraindications. Despite this, the use of HT has de- clined substantially after the publication of the Women 'sH e a l t h Initiative (WHI). 3-5Evidence suggests that contrary to guideline recommendations, younger women and those with more VMSwere less likely to receive HT after the WHI than before. 6Addi- tionally, rates of continuation of HT have declined in womenwith more frequent VMS after the WHI, largely because of me-dia reports and provider advice. Despite the underuse of HT in symptomatic women, some may choose not to use HT or have contraindications to its use,such as a history of an estrogen-sensitive cancer (includingbreast cancer), coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction,Received March 21, 2023; revised and accepted March 21, 2023.

Menopause, V ol. 30, No. 6, 2023 573Menopause: The Journal of The North American Menopause Society V ol. 30, No. 6, pp. 573-590DOI: 10.1097/GME.0000000000002200 \u00a9 2023 by The North American Menopause venous thromboembolism, or inherited high risk of thromboembolic disease.7Nonhormone options are important considerations for women who are not good candidates for HT. This Position Statement updates and expands information on the nonhormone management of VMS from the 2015 NAMS Position Statement on nonhormone therapies and is intended to provide direction to guide evidence-based nonhormone man-agement of VMS. METHODS An advisory panel of clinicians and research experts in the field of women 's health was selected to review and evaluate the literature published after the Nonhormonal Management ofMenopause-Associated Vasomotor Symptoms: 2015 PositionStatement of The North American Menopause Society. Topics were divided into five sections for ease of review: life- style; mind-body techniques; treatments, and technolo- gies. Individual panel members reviewed and evaluated the evidence on the different therapies for which they had specialexpertise, with the knowledge that trials of nonhormone treat-ments of VMS have a placebo improvement rate of 20% to66%, and women with more anxiety show higher responseto placebo. 8 The 2023 Nonhormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society was written after an exten- sive review of the pertinent literature and includes key points identified during the review process. The resulting manuscriptwas submitted to and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. The panel assessed the most current and available literature to recommend or not recommend use with the level of evidenceassigned on the basis of these categories: \u0081Level I: Good and consistent scientific evidence. \u0081Level II: Limited or inconsistent scientific evidence. \u0081Level III: Consensus and expert opinion. This Position Statement uses gender-specific language as reflected in the referenced publications. However, NAMS recog-nizes that some persons experiencing menopause may identifydifferently than with the gender and pronouns used in thisstatement. LIFESTYLE Cooling techniques Hot flashes can be triggered by small, core-body-temperature elevations 9-11; therefore, it is feasible that changing lifestyle practices that control core body temperature may decreaseVMS frequency. These include clothing adjustments (ie, dress-ing in layers; wearing sleeveless blouses; using breathable cloth-ing materials; avoiding pullover sweaters, tops, and scarves) and environmental controls (hand or electric fans; cold packs under the pillow; turning the pillow when feeling warm; dual controlelectric blankets or a bed fan; lower room temperature). Onesmall (N = 20), uncontrolled trial of postmenopausal womenshowed benefits with the use of a forehead cooling device andsleep hygiene instructions for reduction in self-reports of sleepproblems and VMS over a 4-week period. 12Another small trial(N = 39) of a nighttime thermal comfort intervention was stud- ied in a 4-week randomized, crossover trial.13Women reported no objective changes in the number or duration of nighttimeVMS with this device, despite some self-reported improvementsin sleep compared with baseline (ie, no device). Overall, coolinginterventions must be tested in larger randomized, placebo-/sham-controlled clinical trials for the treatment of VMS. (Level II; not recommended) Avoiding triggers W o m e na r eo f t e nt o l dt oa v o i d \"triggers \"such as alcohol, caf- feine, spicy foods, or hot foods or liquids. One cross-sectionalstudy of 4,595 Chinese women found a positive association be-tween alcohol intake and VMS 14; however, this has not been re- ported in other studies (such as the Melbourne Women 'sM i d l i f e Health Project).15There are no clinical trials assessing the ef- fects of avoiding triggers for the alleviation of VMS. (Level II; not recommended) Exercise and yoga Observational studies revealed that women who exercise reg- ularly report fewer VMS.16-18However, others have found no relationship between level of physical activity or exercise andVMS, 19and exercise may trigger VMS in symptomatic women.10Several Cochrane reviews concluded that there was insufficient or poor evidence to consider exercise as a treatment for VMS.20-22Among the challenges, methods and exercise in- terventions varied widely across studies. They included, for ex-ample, supervised walking versus yoga versus no intervention 23 and supervised aerobic exercise versus yoga versus usual activ-ity plus omega-3 or placebo pills. 24No difference was found be- tween yoga and exercise. When study results comparing exer-cise to no exercise were pooled, exercise had no effect on VMS frequency. 22One study in the Cochrane review comparing exercise and HT found that HT was far more effective than exer-cise in reducing VMS. A pooled analysis of individual data from four MsFLASH tri- als (N = 1,005) assessed various interventions compared withplacebo for the treatment of VMS, including estradiol, antide-pressants, omega-3, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for in-somnia, aerobic exercise. 25Women with more both- ersome VMS benefited the most from estradiol, whereas those with VMS and insomnia improved with CBT for insomnia.Those with VMS and psychosocial complaints reported im-provement with antidepressants or CBT for insomnia. Overall,exercise and yoga led to smaller improvements and were not rec-ommended as single interventions for VMS. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 randomized, controlled trials (RCTs; N = 1,306) assessed yoga against no treatment, health education, exercise, and auricular acupressure for the treatment of VMS. 26Given that all outcomes were self-reported and that there was insufficient blinding of partici-pants, there was a high risk for reporting and detection biasamong the studies. Additionally, there was significant heteroge-neity in yoga styles, intensity, and frequency, limiting the inter-pretability of the findings. Y oga had limited benefits comparedNAMS POSITION STATEMENT 574 Menopause, V ol. 30, No. 6, 2023 \u00a9 2023 by The North American Menopause Societywith exercise for the treatment of VMS, and there were no ben- efits compared with no treatment. Although there are other health benefits associated with exer- cise or yoga, the evidence of those interventions for the treat-ment of VMS is sparse. (Level II; not recommended) Dietary modification Research evaluating the relationship of diet and VMS is lim- ited. A study in postmenopausal women with more than twoVMS per day (N = 84) randomized to a low-fat, plant-based dietand a half-cup of cooked soybeans per day versus no dietarychanges found an 88% reduction in moderate to severe VMS compared with a 34% reduction in those with no dietary changes after 12 weeks. 27In surveys, more vegetable and fruit consumption was associated with fewer menopause symp-toms, 28and women who followed a vegan diet reported fewer bothersome VMS than those who ate meat. For both, increasedvegetable consumption was associated with fewer bothersomesymptoms. 29One longitudinal cohort study showed high-fat and -sugar diets were associated with an increased risk of VMS.30One study found that women who had higher soy milk and vegetable consumption had fewer menopause symptoms,whereas those who ate poultry and skimmed dairy productshad worse menopause symptoms overall, including moreVMS. 31There is limited evidence from clinical trials to support the use of dietary modification for improving VMS. (Level III;not recommended) Weight loss Studies have found that women who are obese are more likely to report more frequent and severe hot flashes than women ofnormal weight. 32Randomized, controlled trials have found that weight loss from behavioral interventions are associated with adecrease in VMS. 33,34Additionally, reducing hot flashes was a major motivator for losing weight.33Evidence suggests that the role of adiposity and weight loss in VMS may vary dependingon age or menopause stage and specifically that adiposity actsas a risk factor for VMS earlier in the transition (perimenopauseand early postmenopause) 35but not when women are older or later in the transition.36Weight loss may have greater effects in reducing VMS when women are earlier in the transition.33 In an open-label single-arm pilot study of tion (selective serotonin 2C [5-HT2C] receptor agonist) tested in 20 women, after 12-weeks there were both a decrease inweight and significant improvement in VMS (decline, 5.4 hotflashes/d) from baseline to week 12. 37The study also found that after the weight-loss medication was stopped, there was arapid increase in VMS with a return to baseline weight, furthersupporting the notion that weight loss improved VMS. How-ever, these studies are either small pilot studies, nonran- domized trials, or post hoc analyses of studies designed for a different purpose. Larger, rigorously designed RCTs areneeded. The limited available evidence suggests that weightloss may be used to improve VMS for some women. (LevelsII-III; recommended)Key points \u0081There is no strong evidence that lifestyle changes such as cooling techniques and avoiding triggers improve VMS. \u0081There is insufficient or poor evidence to consider exercise oryoga as a treatment for VMS. \u0081A healthy diet is important for health promotion and chronicdisease prevention; however, there is limited evidence to sup- port dietary modifications as a tool for improving VMS. \u0081Weight loss may be considered for improving VMS. MIND-BODY TECHNIQUES Cognitive-behavioral therapy Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to re- duce the degree to which VMS are rated as a problem. Initial ev-idence came from two double-blind RCTs: MENOS 1, whichshowed that group CBT compared with usual care reducedVMS problem ratings in 96 survivors of breast cancer, 38and MENOS 2, which showed self-guided and group CBT com- pared with usual care reduced VMS problem ratings in 140 peri-menopausal and postmenopausal women without a history ofbreast cancer. 39 A clinical psychologist administered the group CBT interven- tion, which involved psychoeducation (physiology of VMS;how thoughts and emotions affect the perception of physicalsensations), training in relaxation and paced breathing, and cog- nitive and behavioral strategies to manage VMS (identifying and challenging negative beliefs about VMS; monitoring andmodifying triggers of VMS; relaxation exercises). The contentof the self-guided CBT was identical to that of the group CBTand included a self-help book completed during a 4-week pe-riod, two contacts with a clinical psychologist, weekly home-work, and a compact disc for daily practice of relaxation andpaced breathing. The usual-care group received information about VMS, ad- vice on treatment options and symptom management, and in-structions for paced breathing and relaxation. In both studies,improvements in VMS problem ratings were maintained at26 weeks, and more women in the CBT group (65%-78% acrossstudies) reached a clinically significant threshold for improve-ment in VMS that are rated as a problem than in theusual-care group. Beliefs about coping and control over VMS and beliefs about sleep and night sweats mediated the effect of CBT on VMS problem ratings. 40 Since these initial trials, several studies have extended this in- tervention to other modes of delivery and in other populations.Two studies in survivors of breast cancer showed that CBT re-duced 1) VMS rated as a problem, hot flash interference, andself-reported VMS frequency when delivered by trained nursesin MENOS 4 (N = 130), 41or 2) VMS rated as a problem and self-reported VMS frequency when delivered via the internet (with or without therapist support; N = 254).42 A workplace study of 124 menopausal women with problem- atic VMS found that women who received CBT for VMS usinga self-help book had significant reductions in their VMSproblem ratings compared with a waitlist control. 43Another study examined CBT in combination with physical exercise inNAMS POSITION STATEMENT Menopause, V ol. 30, No. 6, 2023 575422 survivors of breast cancer, showing that CBT (with or with- out exercise), but not physical exercise alone, reduced VMSproblem ratings but not VMS frequency compared with awaitlist control. 44 Finally, a study of 72 perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with VMS and depressed mood found that women ran-domized to a 12-week group-based CBT intervention had greater reductions in VMS bother and interference 45as well as improve- ments in depressive symptoms than women randomized to awaitlist control. A caveat to this body of work is that the studieslargely employ waitlist or usual-care controls, which are lessrigorous controls than active controls matched on time and at-tention. However, the body of literature as a whole supports thatCBT alleviates bothersome VMS for both survivors of breastcancer and menopausal women. (Level I; recommended) Mindfulness-based interventions Evidence is limited for mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) for the management of VMS. Common features of MBI in-clude instruction in meditation practices and how to approach thoughts, feelings, and bodily se nsations in an accepting, nonjudg- mental manner. A widely disseminated MBI is mindfulness-basedstress reduction (MBSR), a multicomponent intervention thatincludes mindfulness meditation, body awareness, and yoga. 46 An RCT of MBSR versus waitlist control was conducted in110 women who had five or more moderate to severe hot flashesper day. The MBSR intervention was a standardized, widelyused, 8-week program involving weekly 2.5-hour group classes, at-home practice (45 min, 6 d/wk), and an 8-hour in-person group retreat. Vasomotor symptoms were assessed via a diary.After 20 weeks, the MBSR group showed greater reductionsin hot flash bother (21.62% vs 10.50%; P= .07) (44.56% vs 26.97%; P= .057) than waitlist controls; these differences were marginally significant, reflecting the pilotnature of the study, variability in the outcome, and pronouncedplacebo effect. Several additional studies have examined MBSR or other MBI for a constellation of menopause symptoms (eg, VMS,anxiety, depressive symptoms, sleep disturbance) in womentransitioning through menopause 47,48who were survivors of breast cancer49or who had undergone early bilateral oophorec- tomy.50A meta-analysis similarly examined MBI for quality of life or general menopause symptoms.51These studies have gen- erally shown positive effects in reducing menopause symptoms broadly, with mixed effects for VMS specifically. Given that these studies were limited by their small sizes or limited controlgroups and that they were not designed to consider VMS (eg,women with VMS were not specifically enrolled), there arenot enough data to recommend MBSR for the management ofVMS. Future rigorously designed trials are needed to test theefficacy of MBI for VMS. (Level II; not recommended) Clinical hypnosis Clinical hypnosis is a mind-body therapy that involves a deeply relaxed state and individualized mental imagery and sug-gestion. It has been widely used to manage other chronic symp-toms such as pain and anxiety. Hypnosis has been studied forthe treatment of hot flashes in two trials \u2014one randomized trial in survivors of breast cancer 52and one RCT in women with at least seven hot flashes per day.53In both trials, clinical hypnosis involved 5 weekly in-person sessions of hypnotherapy withat-home self-hypnosis practice. In a study of 60 women with ahistory of breast cancer, clinical hypnosis was significantly bet-ter at reducing hot flashes and improving mood and sleep than no treatment. 52 A 2013 single-blind RCT of 187 postmenopausal women reporting at least 50 hot flashes a week at baseline evaluated clin-ical hypnosis over 12 weeks against an active structured-attentioncontrol. 53Both clinical hypnosis and structured-attention con- trol included 5 weekly sessions that included discussion ofsymptoms, attentive listening, interpersonal exchange, avoid-ance of negative suggestions, monitoring, measurement, and en- couragement provided in a therapeutic environment with a trained clinician. The hypnosis group additionally received hyp-notic inductions and cooling suggestions. Participants in theclinical-hypnosis arm reported significantly lower hot flash fre-quency (74% vs 17%; P< .001) and hot flash scores (frequency times severity, 80% vs 15%; P< .001) than controls. In addition, physiologically monitored hot flashes were reduced signifi-cantly more in the hypnosis group than in the attention-control group (57% vs 10%; P< .001), indicating a clinically signifi- cant improvement. A follow-up analysis showed that effectswere not related to women 's expectations about whether hypno- sis would work. 54The program can be delivered via a trained provider or accessed via a smartphone application. (Level I;recommended) Paced respiration Paced respiration is unlikely to provide any benefit for hot flashes. Paced respiration involves taking six to eight slow, deepbreaths per minute while inhaling through the nose and exhalingthrough the mouth. Paced respiration was shown to reduce hotflashes in several small studies that were done in a behavioral laboratory. 55-57Two larger studies did not show any benefits over other forms of breathing. In a randomized trial of 208 women,paced respiration was no better than shallow breathing or usualcare for reducing hot flash frequency, severity, bother, or inter-ference. 58Similarly, in a randomized trial of 92 women, paced respiration practiced once or twice per day was no better thanusual breathing for reducing hot flash scores (frequency timesseverity). 59A third study showed that women who used a chest device to guide their slow, deep breathing practice at home for at least 15 minutes per day had significantly less benefit than acontrol group assigned to music listening. 60(Level I; not recommended) Relaxation Evidence is limited and incons istent on relaxation for hot flashes. A 2014 Cochrane review61a n da2 0 0 8s y s t e m a t i cr e - view62both concluded that evidence from RCTs of relaxation was insufficient. There are two studies that were not included ineither review. The first was a nonblinded, randomized trial show-ing a reduction in hot flash frequency with applied relaxation(n = 33) compared with a waitlist control group (n = 27). 63,64NAMS POSITION STATEMENT 576 Menopause, V ol. 30, No. 6, 2023 \u00a9 2023 by The North American Menopause SocietyThe second was a randomized trial comparing a nine-module, internet-delivered, applied relaxation program to an untreatedcontrol group. Of 46 women randomized in a 1:1 fashion, 66%dropped out early (no reasons provided), and the study had to beterminated. Limitations across st udies included small sample sizes or lack of an appropriate attention-control group. 55,56,63,65-68 (Level II; not recommended) Key points \u0081CBT has been shown to reduce the bother and interference associated with VMS. \u0081Clinical hypnosis has been shown to reduce VMS frequencyand severity. \u0081MBSR interventions for the management of VMS are limitedby sample size and lack of control groups and are not de-signed to consider VMS; therefore, there are not enough datato recommend treatment. \u0081Paced breathing and relaxation techniques do not alleviateVMS and are not recommended. PRESCRIPTION THERAPIES Many nonhormone prescription therapies have been evaluated and found to significantly reduce VMS in symptomatic meno-pausal women. However, there are only two FDA approved forthis indication: paroxetine mesylate 7.5 mg daily and fezolinetant45 mg daily. Other medications that reduce VMS include selectiveserotonin inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrinereuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), gabapentin, and oxybutynin. Typically,the onset of action is within 2 weeks. There are limited trials comparing nonhormone prescription therapies head-to-head with hormone therapy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors Evidence exists that SSRIs and SNRIs are associated with mild to moderate improvements in VMS, regardless of whether meno-pause is natural or surgical, as supported by meta-analyses, 69-71a pooled analysis,72aCochrane review,73and a review focused on evidence in survivors of cancer.74Limitations to these reviews in- clude heterogeneity of the populations and variations in inclusioncriteria, as well as variability in the population that was tested,dosing, length of treatment, and outcomes evaluated. Paroxetine, 75escitalopram,76citalopram,77venlafaxine,78,79and desvenlafaxine80have been shown to significantly reduce VMS in large, double-blind RCTs of symptomatic women. Duloxetine hasbeen found to reduce VMS in smaller studies. 81,82Hot flash reduc- tions vary from 25% to 69% with these treatments, with im-provements in composite hot flash severity and frequency from27% to 61%. Trends toward improvement have been seen withsertraline and fluoxetine, but these were statistically insignifi- cant; therefore, they are not recommended. 69,79,83-86 A pooled analysis from three RCTs showed that 10 mg to 20 mg of escitalopram, 0.5 mg of oral 17 -estradiol, and 75 mg of venlafaxine daily resulted in comparable reductionsin VMS frequency. A trial reported that 75 mg per day ofvenlafaxine was similar to low-dose oral estradiol 0.5 mg perday. 79,87Oral estradiol reduced the frequency of hot flashesby 2.3 more per day than placebo ( P< .001), whereas venlafaxine reduced the frequency of hot flashes by 1.8 moreper day than placebo ( P= .005). However, neither of these tri- als allowed dose escalation, in which case estradiol would beexpected to provide 77% improvement in hot flashes onaverage. 88 A low-dose paroxetine salt (7.5 mg/d) was the first nonhormone pharmaceutical FDA approved for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS, with improvements found inVMS severity and frequency for up to 24 months, along withimprovements in sleep disruption, without weight gain or nega-tive effects on libido. 89,90 Prior neuroleptic syndrome, serotonin syndrome, monoamine oxidase inhibitors are contraindicationsto SSRIs and SNRIs. Caution should be taken in prescribing in patients with uncontrolled seizures, bipolar disorder, kidney or liver insufficiency, uncontrolled hyponatremia, and poorlycontrolled hypertension, as well as concurrent use of otherSSRIs or SNRIs and pertinent polymorphisms in cytochromeP450 enzyme pathways. Black box warnings include uncom-mon suicidal thoughts in adolescents and children within thefirst few months. Coadministration of SSRIs may lead to inhibition of CYP2D6 (the enzyme that converts tamoxifen to its active endoxifen) in women using tamoxifen, particularlywith paroxetine and include venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, escitalopram, orcitalopram because they have less of an effect on the CYP2D6enzyme. There is a possible reported risk of bone fracture withSSRIs because serotonin alters signaling on bone metabo-lism, 91,92although this has not been seen with short-term use.93They may produce nausea or dizziness, which typically improves after 1 to 2 weeks. (Level I; recommended) Gabapentinoids Gabapentin is FDA approved as an antiepileptic drug that is commonly used to treat diabetic neuropathy and postherpeticneuralgia. However, several trials studying the dose of 900 mg(300 mg three times/d) show that this has improved the fre-quency and severity of VMS. 94-96Possible adverse events (AEs) include dizziness, unstead iness, and drowsiness, typi- cally seen during the first week, with improvement during the second week and resolution by week 4. In a placebo-controlledtrial, higher doses of gabapentin (titrated flash severity scores. 97Adverse events of gabapentin at this dose included dizziness, headache, and dis-orientation, which limited its potential benefits. Because drows-iness is an AE, and the half-life is short, bedtime dosing of gabapentin may be a good choice for women with disruptive s l e e pf r o mV M S .B l a c kb o xw a r n i n g s for all antiepileptic agents, including gabapentin, include uncommon suicidal thoughts orbehaviors. Adverse events include drowsiness, dizziness, andimpaired balance or coordination. The suggested dosing (Table 1)for gabapentin is 900 mg to 2,400 mg per day in divided doses.(Level I; recommended)NAMS POSITION STATEMENT Menopause, V ol. 30, No. 6, 2023 577Pregabalin Pregabalin is a gamma-aminobutyric acid analog structurally related to gabapentin FDA approved for the management ofneuropathic pain and seizures. There has been one phase 3RCT in 163 women (40% with a history of cancer) evaluatingpregabalin for VMS. 98After 6 weeks of treatment, pregabalin at a dose of 75 mg twice a day or 150 mg twice a day decreasedVMS frequency by 59% and 61%, respectively, whereas pla-cebo decreased symptoms by 35%. There were more dizziness and cognitive difficulties reported in those taking pregabalin. Because of limited studies, AEs, including weight gain, and be-cause pregabalin is listed as a Schedule V controlled substance(because of the potential for abuse), pregabalin is not recom-mended. (Level III; not recommended) Clonidine Clonidine is a centrally active -2 adrenergic agonist that has been shown to be modestly more beneficial than placebo 69but less beneficial than SSRIs, SNRIs, and gabapentin in reducingVMS. of AEs, including hy- potension, lightheadedness, headache, dry mouth, dizziness, se-dation, and constipation. Sudden cessation can lead to significantelevations in blood pressure. Because there are other more effec- tive therapies with fewer AEs, clonidine is not recommended. (Levels I-III, not recommended) Oxybutynin Oxybutynin is an antimuscarinic, anticholinergic therapy that is used for the treatment of overactive bladder and urinary urge incontinence. One demon- strated that at doses ranging from 2.5 mg or 5 mgtwice daily up to 15 mg extended-release daily significantly im-proved moderate to severe VMS. Adverse events of oxybutyninare usually dose-dependent and most commonly include a drymouth and urinary difficulties. Long-term use of anticholiner-gics may be associated with cognitive decline, particularly in older persons. 102-104(Levels I-II; recommended) Suvorexant Suvorexant is a dual orexin-receptor of the hypothalamic neuropeptide orexin-A, whichpromotes wakefulness and may be involved in the occurrencesof hot flashes. Postmenopausal women have plasma levels that are three times higher than premenopausal women, which may contribute to sleep disruption and impaired thermoregulation. 105 Suvorexant has been shown to reduce insomnia severity,106-108 and findings in a small study of menopausal women showed thatit led to reductions in nighttime VMS frequency compared withplacebo and was well tolerated. 109Suvorexant did not improve daytime VMS. Given limited data to support its use, suvorexantis not recommended. (Level II; not recommended) Neurokinin B antagonists New nonhormone therapies, only one of which (fezolinetant) is FDA approved, are important because their development wasfounded on the burgeoning understanding of VMS physiology.It is recognized that pulsatile gonadotrophin-releasing hormone(GnRH) secretion is itself driven by an ensemble of pacemakercells that produce kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin,leading to the coined acronym KNDy (pronounced candy )t od e - scribe this unique subset of hypothalamic neurons. These KNDy neurons are surrounded by a dense plexus of intercon- nected fibers to ensure that all KNDy neurons fire in concertand together constitute the GnRH pulse generator. 110 Neurokinin and secretion, lu-teinizing hormone (LH) and follic le-stimulating hormone (FSH) release. In parallel with the effect of KNDy neurons on GnRH in the hypothalamus, the KNDy neur plexus effects on the adjacent hypothalamic thermoregulatory center. 111After declines in circulating levels of estradiol across the menopausetransition, VMS are triggered by hyperactivity of the KNDy neurokinin B from the KNDy neurons onto adja- cent thermoregulatory center in the hypothalamus111causes dis- ruption of temperature control and the occurrence of VMS.112,113 Therapeutic development of neurokinin B antagonists was initi- ated as a novel strategy to target VMS. This nonhormone approachdirectly targets the neural mechanism underlying VMS. Publishedresults of RCTs are available for three distinct agents, withfezolinetant, which is FDA approved, and elinzanetant 114-116in development. A third agent, antagonist (MLE4901),117,118,121is no longer being pursued as a VMS treatment.TABLE 1.

Elinzanetant is a dual neurokinin B receptor-3and receptor-1 antagonist found to be more beneficial than pla-cebo within 2 weeks of use. Phase 3 trials have demonstrated safety, with headache as the most common AE. 120Elevation of hepatic enzymes was rare and resolved either during continuedtreatment or with treatment discontinuation. The effect of neurokinin B antagonists on other symptoms that commonly co-occur with VMS or are frequently experienced dur-ing the menopause transition has received less attention. Early ev-idence suggests benefit for quality of life- and VMS-related dis-tress, awakenings, and VMS-related mood and genitourinary, sexual, cardiovascular, metabolic, and bone health are lacking. Higherdoses appear to suppress LH but not estradiol in postmenopausalwomen with VMS. 114However, potentially advantageous and detrimental effects on other physiologic processes have yet tobe fully investigated in larger populations. Key points \u0081SSRIs and SNRIs are associated with mild to moderate im- provements in VMS. \u0081Gabapentin is associated with improvements in the frequencyand severity of VMS. \u0081Pregabalin is not recommended for VMS because of AEs andcontrolled-substance prescribing restrictions. \u0081Because of significant AEs and no recent studies showinggreater benefit than placebo, clonidine is not recommended. \u0081Oxybutynin has been shown to reduce moderate to severeVMS, although in older adults, long-term use may be associ-ated with cognitive decline. \u0081Given limited data, suvorexant is not recommended. \u0081Fezolinetant is a first-in-class neurokinin B antagonist that isFDA approved for management of vasomotor symptoms. DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS Managing VMS with dietary supplements is complex and challenging because there are limited rigorous randomized, clin-ical trial data from which to evaluate supplements and a lack ofgovernment regulation to ensure their purity and safety. Theseover-the-counter products remain widely marketed throughdirect-to-consumer marketing. They are permitted to market to-ward specific claims of alleviating symptoms despite limited ev- idence as long as there is no claim to provide disease benefit. Dietary supplements with limited or inconsistent evidence of benefit Soy foods and soy extracts Soy is the most widely used isoflavone-containing food. Isoflavones are a class of phytochemicals, a broad group ofnonsteroidal compounds of diverse structure that bind to estro-gen receptors (ERs) in animals and human beings. Isoflavoneshave a greater affinity for ER- than for ER- and possessboth estrogen-agonist and estrogen-antagonist properties. 124 Soy is among the eight most common food allergens,125and reactions can range from mild Statement of The NorthAmerican Menopause Society \"noted mixed evidence for use of soy for VMS. 126Soy trials published since 2015 are difficult to summarize because of the wide variation in interventionstested (eg, soy-based drinks, 127,128soy isoflavone derivatives in tablets only129or combined with exercise,130or mixed with other supplements [herbals, vitamins, or minerals]), with widelyvarying dosages tested. 131-135These studies also have signifi- cant limitations, including small sample sizes,129-131,133,134 use of symptom checklists126-131,133,135rather than VMS di- aries,134and relatively short-term assessment of outcomes. For example, most participants reported VMS after 12 weeks oftreatment, 127-129,131,133-135yet meta-analyses suggest more than 13 weeks are needed to demonstrate half of the expected maximaleffects, 136and more than 16 weeks are needed for optimal ef- fects.137As a result of these study differences and limitations, the findings are mixed, with some studies showing soy to be beneficialfor reducing VMS or severity, 131,132,135and others showing no benefit of soy over placebo127,128,130,133or finding soy to be less beneficial than other treatments.129(Level II; not recommended) Soy metabolite equol Equol is a nonsteroidal estrogen that binds to ER- and ER- , but because of its high affinity for ER- , it is often designated as an ER- agonist. Few studies have considered whether study participants can metabolize soy, which is critical for soy 's poten- tial estrogenic effects. Only 35% of North the soy isoflavone daidzein to equol. 138Women who are able to metabolize soy into equol would be expected to expe-rience relief from VMS with soy products or equol. Women whocannot produce equol after ingesting soy do not benefit from soybut would be expected to benefit from equol. Tests to ascertain whether women are equol producers are not commercially avail- able to the public or healthcare professionals. A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis found positive effects of equol supplementation over placebo for reducingVMS frequency in three of five trials. 139Null findings in the re- maining two trials were hypothesized to have been because oflarge differences in VMS at baseline in one trial and inclusionof only equol-producing women in the largest trial. A limitation in most studies (4 of the 6) was inclusion of fewer than 50 par- ticipants per group. There is currently mixed evidence for soy foods, soy extracts, and the soy metabolite equol from widely diverse studies, withsome significant limitations. (Level II; not recommended) Pollen extract A proprietary extract made from flower pollen has been avail- able under the brand names Relizen, Serelys, Femal, and Femalen.One RCT (N = 53) found that women randomized to receive pollenextract showed significant reductions in VMS on the MenopauseNAMS POSITION STATEMENT Menopause, V ol. 30, No. 6, 2023 579Rating Scale (MRS; 65% VMS reduction with pollen extract vs 38% with placebo, P< .006) and daily diaries (27% greater re- duction with treatment than placebo, P< .026) after 3 months of use.140A single-arm multicenter study (N = 104) found a signif- icant decrease in menopause symptoms after 12 weeks 'use of pollen extract.141An additional observational, single-arm study (N = 108) that included perimenopausal and menopausal women found reduction in hot flashes after 3 months 'use of pollen extract.142However, based on expert opinion and limited scientific research for the management of VMS, pollen extractis not recommended. (Level III; not recommended) Ammonium succinate An ammonium succinate-based supplement (Amberen) was studied for the management of menopause symptoms in amanufacturer-sponsored clinical trial, with an initial study pub-lished in 2016, 143and later a pooled analysis including this study and a second additional study was published in 2019.144 The studies were identical multicenter, double-blind, 90-day RCTs including women aged 42 to 60 years with mild to mod- erate menopause symptoms (n = 227). Both studies showed im-provement in menopause symptoms such as sleep, fatigue, lossof interest in sex, joint and muscle pain, VMS, and a decrease inanxiety compared with the placebo group. Women in the ammo-nium succinate-supplement group also showed an increase inserum estradiol levels and a decrease in leptin. The authors con-cluded that the pooled analysis of the two studies found that the ammonium succinate-based supplement improved meno- pause symptoms, including VMS, compared with placebo.Because of limited studies and the results being based onmanufacturer-sponsored clin ical trials, ammonium succinate is not recommended. (Level II; not recommended) Lactobacillus acidophilus Lactobacillus acidophilus YT1 was studied for managing menopause symptoms. 145One 12-week, multicenter, double blind, RCTl (N = 67) involved women with menopause symp- toms including VMS. After 12 weeks, total Kupperman Index (KI) scores decreased, and quality of life was improved(Menopause-Specific Quality of Life [MSQOL] questionnaire)in all four symptom domains (physical, psychological, vasomotor,and sexual). There were no reported changes in hormone levelsor endometrial lining. Given that this data is limited to one smallstudy, based on global menopause symptom ratings, and has notbeen replicated, it is not recommended at this time. (Level II; not recommended) Rhubarb Siberian rhubarb ( Rheum rhaponticum )i su s e da saf o o da n d as a medicinal plant for constipation, diarrhea, and other gastroin- testinal complaints. A single commercial preparation of rhubarb extract, which has been used in Germany for more than 20 years,was introduced in the United States (Estrovera). The product con-tains a proprietary extract called rhaponticin or extract ERr 731 and contains estrogenic properties but is not estrogen. One studyrandomized 109 symptomatic perimenopausal women to ERr731 (n = 54) or placebo (n = 55) daily for 12 weeks. 146Only7 of 55 women randomized to placebo completed the trial (12.7% retention rate), and 39 of 54 women randomized to activetreatment completed the trial. The researchers reported that at12 weeks, the MRS total score and each symptom within the scale(including VMS) significantly i mproved in the active-treatment group versus placebo. Human safety data were drawn from agroup of 23 women followed for 48 weeks, 20 of whom com- pleted a 96-week observation period. Few AEs were reported. 147 Another open-label, single-arm study in Indian perimenopausal women over 12 weeks reported improved menopause symp-toms. 148Given the extremely low retention rate in clinical trials and the open-label study design in one study, the conclusionsare limited. (Level II; not recommended) Dietary supplements without demonstrated evidence of benefitBlack cohosh Black racemosae ), is the most purchased botanical for menopause symptoms. The active ingredients in black co-hosh extract are unknown, and its mechanism of action is un-clear. At one time it was thought to be estrogenic, with in vitroand in vivo assays indicating estrogen-like activity. studies selective estrogen-receptormodulators 150or modulation of serotonergic pathways, as well as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Reports of possible hepatotoxicity started to appear after 2000. After examining all reported cases, the US Pharmacope-ial Convention Dietary Supplements-Botanicals Expert Com-mittee found 30 reports possibly related to black cohosh. Thecommittee issued a directive that black cohosh products carrya warning statement: \"Discontinue use and consult a health- care practitioner if you have a liver disorder or develop symp- toms of liver trouble, such as abdominal pain, dark urine, or jaundice. \" 151 A2 0 1 2 Cochrane review152analyzed 16 RCTs of 2,027 peri- menopausal or postmenopausal women treated with black co-hosh using a median daily dose of 40 mg for a mean durationof 23 weeks. There was no significant difference between blackcohosh and placebo in the frequency of VMS. Data on safetywere inconclusive. Other literature compared black cohosh to HT in a randomized trial of three groups: group A, 1 mg estra- diol plus cyclic 4 medroxyprogesterone acetate; daily plus cyclic 100 micronized progester-one; and group C, 100 mg Cimicifuga foetida extract daily. 153 The study was limited by sample size because only 81 women (84%) completed the study, and although the KI scores were re-duced in each group, there were no significant differences be-tween groups. Despite this, the authors concluded that C foetida extract could alleviate VMS after 12 weeks. Another large sys- tematic review (35 studies and one meta-analysis) noted thatthe effects of C foetida was possibly dose-dependent as wellas augmented when combined with other products such asSt. John 'sw o r t . 154At this time, there is in sufficient evidence to support the use of black cohosh for VMS. (Level I; notrecommended)NAMS POSITION STATEMENT 580 Menopause, V ol. 30, No. 6, 2023 \u00a9 2023 by The North American Menopause SocietyOther supplements Wild yam. Dioscorea barbasco ,Dm e x i c a n a ,a n d Dv i l l o s a are the varieties of wild yam most commonly used. Dv i l l o s a , also known as Mexican yam or wild yam root, containsdiosgenin, a steroid precursor used in the manufacture of syn-thetic steroids. Diosgenin is converted in vitro to progesterone,but there is no biochemical pathway for this conversion in vivo. Evidence for Dioscorea for VMS is limited. One clinical trial employing a yam cream to treat VMS reported no significantbenefit. 155Tested yam creams often do not contain any yam ex- tract, and many have been adulterated with undisclosed steroids,including estrogens, progesterone, and medroxyprogesteroneacetate. Because of the potential harm that may result from adul-terants and lack of efficacy data, yam creams are not recom-mended for VMS. (Level II; not recommended) Dong quai , also known as Angelica sinensis ,d a n gg u i ,a n d tang kuei, is the root of the Angelica polymorpha Maxim var sinensis (Oliv). Researchers enrolled 71 women in an RCT of 4.5 g dong quai per day or placebo. 156After 24 weeks, there were no differences in VMS frequency; KI scores; levels ofFSH, LH, or estradiol; vaginal maturation index; or endometrialthickness. Dong quai does not appear to alleviate VMS, andthere are a number of safety concerns, including possible photo- sensitization, anticoagulation, (Level II; not recommended) Evening primrose ,Oenothera biennis L, is a flowering plant rich in linolenic acid and -linolenic acid. There is a single trial of evening primrose oil for m enopause symptoms in which 56 women were randomized to evening primrose oil 500 mg perday or placebo for 6 months. 157Evening primrose oil did not show benefit over placebo, with VMS declining by 1.0 per day with evening primrose oil and by 2.6 per day with placebo. (Level not recommended) Maca (Lepidium Meyennii Walp, containsa weak phytosterol ( -sitosterol) also found in several other bo- tanicals such as saw palmetto. Both methanolic and aqueous ex-tracts of maca exhibit estrogenic in vitro, but studieshave found no in vivo estrogenic effects. In a systematic review, four studies showed improvements in Greene Climacteric Scale or KI scores. However, because of quality, design, sample sizes,or limited reporting of study data, 158existing evidence is not strong enough to support the use of maca for VMS. (Level II;not recommended) Ginseng. There are two distinct true ginsengs in common use; Panax ginseng andPanax quinquefolius, as well as a ginseng ( Acanthopanax senticosus or Eleutherococcus senticosus ), a member of a closely related family of plants (Araliacea). In a study of a specific proprietary product, G115 (Ginsana in the United States), 384 postmeno-pausal women were randomized to G115 or placebo. 159After 16 weeks, women taking G115 did not show greater VMS reduc-tions than with placebo. Similarly, researchers found no significanteffect of Korean red ginseng on VMS frequency versus pla-cebo. 160A second study similarly found that ginseng failed to affect VMS when measured by the KI and the MRS.161Thus,ginseng does not appear to be beneficial for VMS. (Level I; not recommended) Labisia pumila /Eurycoma longifolia was studied in a double-blind, 24-week RCT of women aged 41 to 55 years(N = 119) experiencing menopause symptoms (MRS andMSQOL questionnaire used for assessment of symptoms). 162 At week 12, the group randomized to active treatment experi- enced improvement in symptoms (65%) compared with placebo (60%; P< .01). However, at weeks 12 to 24, significant im- provement in the MRS and MSQOL questionnaire scores werenoted in both treatment and placebo groups ( P<. 0 0 1 ) .O v e r a l l , the authors concluded that there were no significant differencesin menopause symptoms between treatment and placebogroups. (Level I; not recommended) Chasteberry. Vitex species have estrogenic properties, and compounds such as apigenin and penduletin are their ER- -selective compounds, agnuside activate ER--dependent responses. 163Four double-blind RCTs have tested supplements containing varying amounts of Vitexagnus-castus (an amount equivalent to 1,000 mg dried vitexfruit, 164,16550 mg of vitex fruit extract,166or 125 mg vitex fruit167) in combination with various other supplements165-167 or combined with Nigella satvia and citalopram 20 mg per day.164All trials included perimenopausal or postmenopausal women with VMS and included methods to assess compliance.The largest and most rigorous trial (n = 100) compared a mixedsupplement to placebo and found no group differences in dailydiary VMS frequency or questionnaire VMS intensity after16 weeks of treatment. 165The remaining three smaller (<50 women/group) trials used less rigorous questionnaire-onlymeasures of VMS (rather than di aries) and found significant reductions in VMS frequency, bother, or intensity ratings after 8 to 12 weeks of treatment. 164,166,167Few AEs were reported in any of the trials. Because of differences in the compounds thatwere tested, it is not possible to conclude that Vitex alone im-proves VMS. (Level II; not recommended) Milk thistle is a member of the Asteracease family, a thera- peutic herb used for fever and kidney and spleen disease. Oneprevious study evaluated its effect in polyherbal formulations that included black cohosh, dong quai, and other herbs. It has been evaluated in a small RCT of 40 women receiving Silybum marianum extract and 40 women receiving placebo over a 12-week period and reported improvement in hot flashes andnight sweats severity over placebo. 168Because of the limitations of one study, there is not enough evidence to make a recommen-dation. (Level II; not recommended) Omega-3 fatty acid supplements contain fatty including eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and -linolenic acid. Phospholipids, a major component of neuronal cells, contain a high prevalence of fatty acids. Twotrials have evaluated omega-3s for VMS: In an 8-week trial of91 women randomized to placebo or omega-3 supplement (totaldaily dose, 1,100 mg eicosapentaenoic acid plus 50 mgdocosahexaenoic acid), VMS frequency and intensity were signif-icantly improved with omega-3 compared with placebo. 169In a 12-week trial, women were randomized in a 1:1 ratio toNAMS POSITION STATEMENT Menopause, V ol. 30, No. 6, 2023 581omega-3s (n = 177) or placebo (n = 178) and simultaneously in a 3:3:4 ratio to yoga (n = 107), aerobic exercise (n = 106), ortheir usual physical activity (n = 142). There were no significantdifferences in VMS frequency or bother with omega-3s or pla-cebo. 170Therefore, there is mixed and inconclusive evidence for the use of omega-3s for the management of VMS. (Levels I-II; not recommended) Vitamin E . Previous studies investigating the effects of vita- min E for VMS treatment incl uded two crossover trials (N = 120; N = 50) that showed limited reduction in VMS fre-quency with vitamin E compared with placebo. 171,172There is very little evidence for vitamin E having significant benefit in re-ducing VMS. A study from Iran with a total of 93 participantsevaluated the use of curcumin alone and vitamin E alone in reduc-ing VMS as well as other symptoms of menopause versus pla- cebo (30 women/group). 173There was some improvement seen at 4 weeks for curcumin and at 8 weeks for vitamin E comparedwith placebo. Results were significant at 4 weeks for curcuminand at 8 weeks for vitamin E, but sample sizes were small, limit-ing conclusions. Therefore, vitamin E is not recommended forthe management of VMS. (Level I; not recommended) Cannabinoids The data evaluating the relationship between cannabinoids and menopause symptoms is very limited. This lack of evidenceis particularly notable because more than one-quarter of womenhave used or are using marijuana to treat their menopause symp- toms. 174A systematic review found only three small studies that evaluated cannabis use and its associations with menopausesymptoms, including VMS, insomnia, mood, and depression/anxiety. 175Based on the lack of available evidence, cannabi- noids cannot be recommended for the treatment of VMS. (LevelII; not recommended) Key points \u0081Given mixed evidence of benefit for VMS, soy foods, soy ex- tracts, and the soy metabolite equol are not recommended. \u0081Given the lack of rigorous, evidence-based scientific re-search supporting the use of any over-the-counter supple-ments and herbal therapies for the management of VMS, these remedies are not recommended. \u0081Cannabinoids are not recommended for the treatment of VMS. ACUPUNCTURE, OTHER TREATMENTS, AND TECHNOLOGIES Acupuncture Acupuncture is a component of the ancient practice of tradi- tional Chinese medicine in which thin needles are inserted intothe skin at key points in the body and activated through specificmovements (manual acupuncture) or with electrical stimulation (electroacupuncture) to create an energy flow, or Qi,which is believed to improve overall health. Sham acupuncture is aplacebo-equivalent treatment involving needles inserted at unre-lated points or needles that do not pierce the skin. Over the last decade, several systematic reviews and meta-analyses examined acupuncture versus no treatment orsham intervention for the treatment of VMS. In most systematicreviews, 176-178as well as in RCTs,179acupuncture was deemed to alleviate some menopause-related symptoms (eg, mood, sleep,pain) as reflected in the reduction in menopause-related totalscores (eg, KI, Greene (eg, MSQOL questionnaire); ithad, however, little to no clinical benefit for the improvementof VMS compared with sham interventions, either for symp- tomatic midlife women or for survivors of breast cancer. Consistent with this conclusion, a 2018 study (umbrella meta-analysis) that included three systematic reviews and fourRCTs found modest benefits of acupuncture for the alleviationof menopause-related symptoms, quality of life, and VMS sever-ity or frequency when treatments were compared with no treat-ment. 180Results, however, were no longer clinically significant when acupuncture was compared with sham intervention. There has been a considerable debate regarding the use of ap- propriate comparisons or control groups in acupuncture studies;some have argued, for example, that sham interventions may notbe physiologically inert and therefore would not be the most ap-propriate comparison for studies or trials that aim to inform clin-ical practice. It is important to note that although most studiesthat compared traditional acupuncture with sham interventionsfound no significant difference in VMS frequency or severity, trials with electroacupuncture showed some benefits with this intervention and even stronger results for electroacupuncturewhen compared with manual acupuncture. 181 In a 2021 model-based meta-analysis, Li and colleagues assessed 17 studies (1,123 participants), including manual acu-puncture, electroacupuncture, and sham acupuncture. 178The au- thors found that after 8 weeks of treatment, both electroacupunctureand a combination of both acupuncture modalities (traditional acupuncture and electroacupuncture) led to significant reduc- tion of VMS per day compared with sham intervention. More-over, the benefits of electroacupuncture for VMS were compa-rable to those reported in previous studies using nonhormone,pharmacologic treatments such as SSRIs, SNRIs, gabapentin,and escitalopram. Existing evidence does not support the use of traditional acu- puncture for the treatment of VMS, neither for midlife women nor for VMS in survivors of breast cancer. (Level I; not recom- mended). The use of electroacupuncture, although more promising,still warrants further investigation. (Level II; not recommended) Stellate ganglion block Stellate ganglion blockade is a widely used treatment for pain management, including for migraine and complex regional painsyndrome. The treatment is accomplished through the injectionof an anesthetic agent at the lower cervical or upper thoracic regionbecause the stellate ganglion is located bilaterally in the C6-T2 re- gion of the anterior cervical spine. Adverse events, such as tran- sient seizures or a bleeding complication, are extremely rare andminimized using imaging guidance during the procedure. 182 Stellate ganglion blockade has emerged as a potential treat- ment option for VMS in both midlife women and those withbreast cancer, although the exact mechanism of action of stellateganglion blockade on VMS remains unclear.NAMS POSITION STATEMENT 582 Menopause, V ol. 30, No. 6, 2023 \u00a9 2023 by The North American Menopause SocietyOne randomized, sham-controlled trial assessed active stel- late ganglion blockade with bupivacaine versus a sham proce-dure (subcutaneous saline injection) for VMS in women withnatural or surgical menopause (N = 40). 183Over a 6-month follow-up, there was a reduction in subjectively reported VMSintensity and frequency (moderate to very severe) in the stellateganglion blockade group compared with the sham-control group. Moreover, there was a reduction (21%, P< .05) of physiologic VMS measured with ambulatory skin conductance monitors frombaseline to 3 months in the stellate ganglion blockade group,whereas the sham-control group showed no reduction. Four uncon-trolled, open-label studies showed that stellate ganglion blockadereduced VMS, with effects ranging from a 45% to a 90% reduc-tion 6 weeks to several months after blockade. 184-187 In a study of patients with breast cancer (N = 40), stellate gan- glion blockade (10 mL 0.5% bupivacaine injected bilaterally) was compared with paroxetine 7.5 mg per day over a 6-week pe-riod. 188Both treatments had a positive effect on an index com- prising both VMS frequency and severity, with no significantdifferences between treatments. Overall, stellate ganglion blockade might help alleviate mod- erate to very severe VMS in select women. Results from ongo-ing larger RCTs are needed to provide more definitive evidence. Given that stellate ganglion blockade is a procedure that in- volves potential risks and AEs, its potential use for VMS shouldbe carefully evaluated. (Levels II-III; recommended) Calibration of neural a closed-loop acoust ic stimulation neurotechnology based on the principle of allostasis. Essentially, scalp sensorsand software algorithms translate specific brain frequencies into audible tones of varying pitch in real time, and these tones areimmediately mirrored back via ear buds, allowing the brain to\"listen to itself \"in an acoustic mirror. High-resolution, rela- tional, resonance-based electroencephalic mirroring has shownsome preliminary benefits for the management of insomnia 189 and for military-related stress.190 In an uncontrolled study, 14 women showed a significant re- duction in VMS frequency and severity after administration withhigh-resolution, relational, resonance-based electroencephalicmirroring aimed at autocalibration of neural oscillations. Given the lack of controlled trials, high-resolution, relational,resonance-based electroencephalic mirroring is not recom-mended for treatment of VMS. (Level II; not recommended) Chiropractic intervention There have been no clinical trials of chiropractic interventions for VMS, and epidemiologic survey data show no association be-tween use of such interventions and VMS. 192Chiropractic inter- ventions are not recommended for treatment of VMS. (Level II; not recommended) Key points \u0081Existing evidence does not support the use of traditional acu- puncture for the treatment of VMS; electroacupuncture re-quires more rigorous study before it can be recommended.\u0081Stellate ganglion blockade might alleviate moderate to verysevere VMS in select women but is associated with potentialrisk. \u0081Calibration of neural oscillations and chiropractic interven-tions are not recommended for treatment of VMS. RECOMMENDATIONS Vasomotor symptoms are common in midlife women and re- main undertreated. These symptoms can disrupt a women 's overall quality of life and last a mean duration of 7 to 9 years, longer in some women. Hormone therapy remains the first-line recommended treatment to ameliorate VMS in healthy womenat or around the time of menopause. However, it is important torecognize that not all women are candidates for HT because ofcontraindications or personal preference. This Position Statementsupports the use of and recommends ganglion block (Levels II- III). There is negative or insufficient evidence for these, so they are not recommended: paced respiration (Level I); supplements/herbal remedies (Levels I-II); cooling techniques, avoiding trig-gers, exercise, yoga, MBI, relax ation, suvorexant, soy foods and soy extracts, soy metabolite cannabinoids, acupuncture, dietary modification andpregabalin (Level III). Clinici ans should be knowledgeable of the nonhormone options supported by evidence that are available to offer to women (Table 2).
