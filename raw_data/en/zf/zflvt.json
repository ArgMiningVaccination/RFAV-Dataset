The practitioner's role is to help bring their client's personal energy fields into balance and improve the health and wellness of the body, mind, and collective spirit. What is energy healing? Energy healers help clients with a wide range of ailments, from anxiety to chronic pain, and relieve side effects from cancer treatments. The use of energy healing techniques can be applied to minor or major physical ailments, and may even help a variety of mental health problems. As an energy healer, you may be prepared to work alongside traditional medical practitioners as part of a holistic therapy program. Many practitioners choose to practice independently, as this form of healing is extremely unique and subjective for each client and practitioner. Additionally, many energy healers incorporate their energy healing training into other popular practices such as massage therapy or [acupressure](https://www.naturalhealers.com/blog/acupressure/). How to ethically practice energy medicine Treatment plans Energy healing does not have direct support or data that aligns with traditional western medicine. The impact and effect of healing therapy differ from patient to patient and practitioner to practitioner. Those who have trained in multiple facets of alternative medicine may be able to develop a more specific treatment plan for their potential client's needs. Referrals Energy healing practitioners may also uphold their ethical practice by referring clients to a different practitioner in their network with a stronger knowledge of the treatment area needed. For example, an energy healer may refer their client to a licensed psychologist in order to undergo talk therapy. It is essential for someone practicing in the field of energy medicine to maintain a high ethical standard, which may require turning away clients who do not seem fit for treatment. An expert's take on being a good energy healer Proper training and clear communication with your patients are essential in the field of energy healing, and all modalities of alternative health and wellness. \"As an alternative therapy practitioner, it is essential to have received proper training in your modality and to continue seeking additional education. It is vital to have the good judgment to understand when it is appropriate for you to treat or when to refer the client to a different practitioner if the need is out of your area of experience or expertise,\" said Dr. Lola Scarborough, teacher, and therapist at the Healing Hut based in League City, Texas.
