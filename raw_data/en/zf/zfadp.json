The Porphyrias Consortium has developed an of cial statement regarding the COVID-Vaccination, also available on www.porphyriafoundation.org.COVID-19 VACCINE STATEMENT Generally, there is no evidence that any vaccines cause particular problems in people with porphyrias. As a general rule, we therefore recommend that patients with any type of porphyria receive vaccinations, in accordance with established guidelines, and under the care and follow-up of their personal physicians. It is the unanimous opinion of the expert physicians of the Porphyrias Consortium that it is important for all porphyria patients to receive the COVID-19 vaccinations, unless their personal physicians have indicated that, in their particular medical situations, not including porphyria, vaccination is not recommended.COVID-19 and PORPHYRIA Updates and statements from porphyria experts will be listed on www.porphyriafoundation.org.The APF extends our gratitude to each of you for your tremendous support during this past his- toric year. You are the heroes that embraced the mission of the APF and champi- oned the programs and services that bene t all members of the porphyria community, which included a continued relentless focus on research. The APF worked hard to pivot and expand our pro- grams to meet the needs of the community amid the global pan- MRNA COVID-19 VACCINES - SIMPLIFIED Many of our members have asked about the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and why it is different from the other vaccines. Here is a simpli ed explanation. The mRNA vaccine is a new type of vaccine, but scientists have been researching it for decades. These vaccines can be developed in a laboratory using easily available materials, which is why they can be developed faster than other vaccines and why they can also be standardized easier and faster. Unlike the vaccines that trigger an immune response by put- ting a weakened or inactivated virus into our bodies, the mRNA vaccines use a different process. The mRNA instructs our cells how to make a harmless piece of a protein that triggers an immune response inside our bodies. Note the mRNA never enters the nucleus of the cell. This is important because the nucleus contains our DNA. Next, the body gets rid of the protein piece after it breaks down the instructions from mRNA. The cell displays the protein on its surface. The immune system recognizes that the protein does not belong there and begins an immune response and making antibodies. Thus, in most cases, the people who are vaccinated are protected without being sick with COVID-19. Of great importance is that the mRNA vaccine process may be the wave of the future as it gives us protection without exposing us to the live or non-live virus. Both the Moderna and P zer/BioNTech vaccines require a primary dose shot and a booster shot. With P zer, the booster is 21 days later and Moderna is 28 days later. P zer's shot contains 30 micrograms of vaccine and Moderna 100 micrograms. The shots have similar side effects. demic. This work has staged the porphyria community for a busy and productive 2021. Read on to learn about research studies, clinical trials, patient education meetings, updated physician edu- cation materials, advocacy opportunities, awareness week activi- ties, stories about members in our community and so much more. The entire APF team is here for YOU and we are all supported by our dedicated porphyria expert physicians. We have much hope for the future, and our community efforts should mirror the words of Dr. Chris Austin, Director of NIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, \"Hope is ineffective without action!\" APF looks forward to serving you all in 2021 and beyond! 2 | 4915 St. Elmo Avenue, Suite 200, Bethesda, MD 20814 | 866.APF.3635 | www.porphyriafoundation.orgRARE DISEASE DAY 2021 Rare Disease Day is an observance typical- ly held on the last day of February to raise awareness for rare diseases and improve ac- cess to treatment and medical representation for individuals with rare diseases and their families. Rare Disease Day 2021 was marked by awareness efforts around the world, and events at NIH and the FDA in the United States. 1 in 10 individuals live with a rare disease making this an important day to highlight the needs of millions Americans living with a rare disease. NIH organized a day- long event including presentations from experts and patients to nearly 1000 attendees. Kristen Wheeden, APF Executive Director, moderated a discussion regarding changes in research and clin- ical studies related to Covid-19. On March 5, the FDA hosted a virtual meeting that highlighted strategies to support rare disease product development.UPCOMING EVENTS Porphyria Awareness Week is an opportunity for you to create awareness within your com- munity! Let's talk about it! We strive to dedicate this week to promote Porphyria awareness, reduce the stigma associated with porphyria through education and increase support for those impacted. Greater awareness can equal earlier diagnosis, better management, and access to life-altering treatments. SHOW YOUR STRIPES is the theme of Rare Disease day, alluding to the zebra as a symbol for rare disease, which started around 1940. This comes from a quote by Dr. Theodore Woodward, \"When you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras.\" and \"When you hear hoofbeats behind you, don't expect to see a zebra.\" Most physi- cians are taught to focus on the likeliest possibilities when making a diagnosis, not the unusual ones. Through rare disease aware- ness and showing our stripes, an increasing number of physi- cians include rare disease as a potential diagnosis. We encourage healthcare professionals to THINK PORPHYRIA when patients present with symptoms consistent with a type of porphyria. PORPHYRIA #LETST ALKPORPHYRIAAPRIL 10 /hyphen.case17, 202 1 #LETSTALKPORPHYRIA focuses on starting the conversation about Porphyria. This campaign encourages our community members to educate and partake in a dialogue with their peers and healthcare providers about Porphyria. How will you get the discussion started? Get creative and let us know how you will get involved. We hope Porphyria Awareness Week 2021 empowers you to raise porphyr- ia awareness within your communities. The American Porphyria Foundation is here to support you with ideas, brochures, mate- rials, social media les (including Logo Files, Porphyria Fact Sheets, Press Release - and any other support that you may need to raise Porphyria awareness about Porphyria in your community. Visit www.porphyriafoundation.org for daily updates and resources on Porphyria Aware- ness Week 2021.WHAT CAN YOU DO? Wear purple for Porphyria! Some have had a class or an of ce wear purple for the day in support of porphyria. Educate friends and family. Send an email, a social media post, or send a letter about your experience with porphyria. This is a great time to virtually talk to a class or host a virtual lunch and learn. Tell your story to local media. Help others by spreading your experience. Television, newspapers, community magazines are looking for people who have undertaken the challenge with a rare. Help others by sharing knowledge about porphyria with your community, including your family members, friends, and the phy- sicians in your local hospitals. Suggest that they host a virtual seminar or a local meeting where you can hand out materials. Share your story on social media. It is an easy and effective way of getting porphyria in the public eye. The American Porphyria Foundation will continue to partner with other internation- al porphyria advocacy organizations to in- crease awareness around porphyria. 4915 St. Elmo Avenue, Suite 200, MD 20814 | 866.APF.3635 | www.porphyriafoundation.org | 3NORD RAREINSIGHTS\u00ae REPORT The National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) pub- lished a new RareInsights\u00ae report today looking at com- parative trends in rare disease care and treatment in the U.S. over a 30-year period. Key ndings include:GLOBAL PORPHYRIA ADVOCACY COALITION (GPAC) VIDEO GPAC is an umbrella organi- zation that provides a uni ed, collaborative voice for porphyria patients worldwide. It connects, supports, and engages national porphyria patient advocacy organizations, through the provision of an integrated inter- national network, in an effort to gain aware- ness, access to diagnosis, management and treatment of the porphyrias. Porphyria advocacy group leaders from around the world are now recording a video to lift their voices and raise awareness about porphyr- ia. Leaders in a dozen countries will share how they are impact awareness among patients, physicians and the public. Spe- cial thanks to Alnylam Pharmaceuticals for sponsoring and organizing this project! 2021 PATIENT EDUCATION MEETINGS In keeping with COVID safety protocols, our patient education meetings and educa- tional series will continue to be on Zoom for the foreseeable future. January 28, 2021 - Hetan- shi Naik, PhD, Professor and Clinical Genetics Counselor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, led a presentation on genetics and porphyria. Patients were treated to a discussion on \"genetics 101\" overview followed by an exploration of ge- netics in the porphyrias. February 25, 2021 - Ms. Karli Hedstrom, Senior Research Coordinator at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, led an education session on the importance of re- search participation. Putting \"Research is the Key to Your Cure\" into action was the focus on Ms. Hedstrom's talk. Why partic- ipate in research? What can we learn? - were the main topics discussed. We will continue to schedule informative and supportive meetings. Have an idea for a meeting? Give us a call and let us know. Email Director of Patient Services, Edrin Williams, at edrinw@porphyriafoundation. org to be reminded of upcoming events. \u00bb 88% of people today reported that they would consider using an investigational drug or treatment, compared to 62% in 1989. \u00bb 16% of individuals today reported that they had already participated in a clinical trial for their rare disease, compared to 12% in 1989. \u00bb 17% of individuals today have already relocated or are considering relocating to access care for their rare disease, versus 8% in 1989. \u00bb 2% of respondents today reported that they did not have health care insurance, versus 9% in 1989. The full report is on the NORD website at rarediseases.org/advocate/rareinsights. The American Porphyria Foundation is proud of our Platinum mem- bership in the National Organization of Rare Disorders. PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES (PROS) AND PORPHYRIA A patient-reported outcome (PRO) is a health outcome directly reported by the person who experienced it related to a speci c treatment or condition. A PRO is distinct from other health outcome measures that may be reported by someone else, including a physician or investigator. PROs are critical in research and have increased through electronic means in recent years. PROs can be used for general care improvements, research, and clinical trials. There is a range of potential PRO measurements - many that you see in studies in porphyria. When you receive a request to participate in a survey, questionnaire, interview, or clinical trial related to porphyria, know that the research community is seeking to understand the impact of living with porphyria from YOUR point of view. #ResearchIsTheKeyToYourCure PROS IN PORPHYRIA PROs through Electronic Diary The Mitsubishi Tanabe MT-7117 Phase 2 clinical trial, completed in 2019, titled Study to Evaluate Ef cacy, Safety, and Tolerability of MT-7117 in Subjects With Erythropoietic Protoporphyria collected critical PROs as a part of the array of collected data to analyze the treatment. The primary outcome measure in this study was the 'Change from baseline in average daily duration of sunlight exposure without symptoms' (clinicaltrials.gov). To collect accurate data, pa- tients reported their daily exposure in an electronic diary. This pivotal study, using patient reported outcomes paved the way for a Phase 3 clinical trial. PROs through 1:1 Interviews An important study titled Patient Perspective on Acute Intermittent Porphyria with Frequent Attacks: A Disease with Intermittent and Chronic Manifestations (The Patient, 2018) focused on the impact of the patient experience on daily living. Data was collected through one-on-one interviews. The study highlight- ed the chronic manifestations of living with AIP in addition to the intermittent acute attacks. 4 | 4915 St. Elmo Avenue, Suite 200, Bethesda, MD 20814 | 866.APF.3635 | www.porphyriafoundation.orgPOWER STUDY IN ACUTE PORPHYRIA Acute Porphyria Patients needed! Kantar, an independent re- search agency, is collaborating with sponsoring company Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, and with the assistance of the patient advocacy groups the American Porphyria Foundation, the Global Porphyria Advocacy Coalition, and the International Porphyria Patient Net- work to conduct research on Acute Hepatic VP , ADP). In this context, we along with the American Porphyria Foundation invite you to participate in the Porphyria Worldwide Patient Experi- ence Research (POWER) study. Your input is critical to increasing awareness and understanding of AHP and the needs of patients living with this condition.

CURRENT RESEARCH INITIATIVES are listed on the APF website: porphyriafoundation.orgFIND YOUR SHADOW 2021! Applications are open for our fourth annual FIND YOUR SHADOW program. Last year, we selected Anthony Zamora and Cheyenne Lud- wig as our recipients. Unfortunately, due to COVID restrictions, we had to roll over their awesome experiences into 2021. That is not stopping Shadow Jumpers from looking for new submissions to help take on the sun in 2021. Two years of experiences loaded into what we hope is an eventful end of the year. We are looking for kids under the age of 18 attempting to do something they have always wanted to try but may have been holding off from doing because of their EPP . Whether attempting recess, an outdoor sport/camp, a speci c family vacation or more, nothing is off limits. We ask EPP families to submit their story and tell us how we can help make living with EPP easier. Go to SHADOW JUMPERS on the APF website for more details. Applications are open now until Friday, April 30th, 2021, and recipients will be announced in May! INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON PORPHYRINS AND PORPHYRIAS 2021/2022 Due to the global pandemic, The European Porphyria Network (Epnet) and the organizers in So a (Bulgaria) have decided to post- pone the 2021 International Con- gress on Porphyrins and ias (ICPP). The new the ICPP 2022 will be: September 4-7th 2022 in So a, Bulgaria.4915 St. Elmo Avenue, Suite 200, Bethesda, MD 20814 | 866.APF.3635 | www.porphyriafoundation.org | 5 GLOBAL NEWS As the number of Global people with porphyria rises in our APF database, so does the number of people in countries outside of the United States who are using our website and social media platforms. Imagine we now have people from over 100 countries viewing our website and thousands on our social media groups. One of those users reached out to the APF when a family member from Florida visit- ed relatives in Ecuador and suffered a serious AIP attack. When the patient became critical, she was admitted into the ICU in Ecuador. Since the hospital did not have the appropriate treatments and could not have her transferred to the US, the family sought assistance from the APF, namely the Global Director. Immediately we contact- ed Dr. Cynthia Levy, an esteemed porphyria expert in Miami, and the Air Evac and transfer teams. The patient was evacuated to the Florida hospital. We sincerely thank Dr. Levy, who kindly provided the porphyria expertise during the crisis. The patient is now greatly improved. These stories are not infrequent. Patients and doctors around the world continue to reach out to the APF to seek help from experts. For example, within a few weeks, experts Drs. M. Kazamel, K. Anderson and H. Bonkovsky consulted with doctors in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Pakistan, Egypt, and Oman to assist patients suffering from acute porphyria. We sincerely thank our experts for providing such life-saving exper- tise to doctors around the globe. Another major effort to educate patients are our Zoom meetings. International patients are the focus of our language-based calls. We recently hosted a Spanish-language call led by Kika Shabot, director of the Mexico Porphyria Society, and facilitated an- other Zoom meeting for patients in Colombia hosted by the Porphyria Foundation of Colombia.

In they have purported that this high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in acute porphyrias warrants that these patients should be evaluated pe- riodically for hepatocellular carcinoma by ultrasound surveillance. The reason researchers feel this occurs is that genes encoding for heme biosynthetic pathway may not act as tumor suppressor genes and chronic increased levels of aminolevulinic acid could lead to the generation of free radicals and subsequently to hepatic carcinogenesis. Therefore, it is recommended that acute patients SPEAK WITH YOUR DOCTORS ABOUT ORDERING AN ULTRA- SOUND TO CHECK FOR HEPATACELLULAR CARCINOMA. As well as hepatocellular carcinoma, patients with acute porphyr- ias also can experience an increased risk for developing kidney and liver problems and high blood pressure. These conditions can impact their generally normal life span. NIH COALITION OF PATIENT ADVOCACY GROUPS (CPAG)- WEBINAR SERIES \"Working with Industry in the Conduct of Clinical Trials,\" was the title of a recent webinar held virtually on Thursday, Feb- ruary 25, 2021, that focused on the relationship between industry partners and patient advocacy groups. A productive discussion took place on what types of assistance industry may ask of patient groups including developing protocols; helping to recruit patients; helping to recruit clinic sites; and using the resources of the pa- tient groups for outreach. This session also focused on questions to ask industry when entering a partnership. Presenters include patient advocacy group leaders and industry partners - including Kristen Wheeden, APF alongside Jordanna Mora of Alnylam Phar- maceuticals. This is the third in a ve-part series on clinical trials. A Primer on Porphyrias was published in the American Society of Hematology (ASH) printed and digital journals in early Febru- ary. Focused on the experience of the Porphyria Satellite Center at the University of Washington, the article delved into diagnosis, pathogenesis, clinical features, and novel therapeutics. Though the porphyrias are treated by a variety of medical specialists, he- matologists are often the most common treating physicians of the porphyrias given that de ciencies lie in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Of note, the APF website experienced an uptick in visits from healthcare professionals after the release of the article - the more physicians who are educated in the porphyrias, the better for the patient community! COVID UNCOVERS A CASE OF ACUTE PORPHYRIA SAN ANTONIO, TX - KTXS12ABC re- cently reported on a porphyria case related to COVID-19. In the report by Alejandra Guzman-Tracy, a young woman became paralyzed after a bat- tle with COVID-19 due to a rare genetic disorder - Acute Intermit- tent Porphyria. The 27-year-old, Marisela Torres, tested positive for COVID after developing every symptom except shortness of breath. Doctors found the cause after a few weeks. According to Torres, \"COVID triggered, what I have, which is something called porphyria. It's a genetic thing I was actually born with.\" Marisela was on a ventilator for about ve months, including her birthday in November, and lost 58 pounds in the process. The doctor main- tained that \"she and her mom were very, very passionate about like keep ghting, keep ghting.\" Mari's healthcare team says her recovery is a miracle. They were able to wean her off the ventilator and after six months she can breathe on her own. With rehabilita- tion, Marisela has been able to get back on her feet. NEW MEMBER STORIES!

PETER TISHLER PASSES AWAY It is with great sadness that we share the passing of Dr. Peter Tischler on January 18. He is survived by his wife of 60 years, in addition to his children, grandchildren and brother. A Harvard and Yale graduate, Dr. Tish- ler was an educator, researcher and clinical physician specializing in human genetics and orphan diseases. A preeminent expert in the porphyrias, Dr. Tishler was a member of the APF Scienti c Advisory Board and oversaw the creation of the APF Safe/Un-safe Drug Database. The APF has heard from patients and physicians alike that Dr. Tishler was a champion in the porphyrias. We send our deepest sympathy and condolences to the Tishler Family. APF fondly re- members our friend and AIP pa- tient Michelle Siu- ta, who passed away last April, while undergo- ing a double organ transplant for a kidney and liver. Michelle Marie Siuta was strong, creative, smart, thoughtful, honest, and fun loving. Her energy could light up any room. She was a beautiful soul, inside and out. After growing up on a farm, Michelle pursued a career in engineering. Due to Mi- chelle's health concerns, she was forced to cut her engineering career short. Her goal had been to gain personal experience in crop production, a deeper understanding of farm management, and the entrepre-neurial skills to positively contribute to her family's existing farm. She was incredibly passionate about art, music, sports, and dancing. She enjoyed learning about differ- ent cultures and had the ability to brighten the mood and make people laugh. She had hoped to travel extensively and explore the world - when her health allowed. Michelle gave back to the community by being an advocate for the American Porphyria Foun- dation and serving on a board to educate pharmaceutical companies about the im- pact of porphyria. She was a volunteer Fire- ghter and graduated from her local Sher- iff's Civilian Police Academy. Michelle's faith in God was unwavering, it helped her to persevere, despite the health struggles she faced, struggles she refused to be de ned by. Authentically herself, Michelle's own words sum up her short, yet beautiful life: \"Dreams are nothing if not ful lled, they're only visions that appear. All your hopes and all your might could be washed away just like a tear. Nothing more, nothing less, it's so easy to lose your way. But if you're strong and don't give up, you will live your dreams someday.\" We send our deepest sympathy to the Siuta Family. https://zajacfuneralhomeinc.com/tribute/ details/873/Michelle-Siuta/obituary.html ARCHIVED APF NEWSLETTERS We have heard from many APF members that have enjoyed the APF quarterly newsletter over the years. In fact, the rst newslet- ter was published in 1984. \"Remember...Research is the Key to Your Cure\" has been included in every single newsletter since the rst! An archive of all printed publications is kept in the APF of ce, but you can access the materials on www.porphyriafoundation. org under \"News\" in the menu, which includes issues since 2005. Take a few moments to read about the research, physician efforts, conferences, meetings, and so much over the years. It is also a powerful reminder of how far we have come in research and treat- ment in the porphyrias!After her passing, Michelle's family honored her memory and mission to bring more awareness of Porphyria to patients and doctors through a tremendous fundraising effort. The APF will steward the funds with love and care, focusing on all who battle porphyria.4915 St. Elmo Avenue, Suite 200, Bethesda, MD 20814 Address Service RequestedNon-Pro t U.S. Postage PAID Gaithersburg, MD Permit No. 264The information contained on the American Porphyria Foundation (APF) Web site or in the APF newsletter is pro- vided for your general information only.
