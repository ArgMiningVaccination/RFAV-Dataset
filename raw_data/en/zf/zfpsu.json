This document is updated weekly. Vaccine efficacy refers to the performance of a vaccine in a controlled clinical trial (study) situation Vaccine effectiveness refers to the performance of a vaccine in a population under real-world conditions Key messages COVID-19 vaccine efficacy results from different trials cannot be directly compared against each other. They must be interpreted in the context of study designs (including case definitions, clinical endpoints, access to testing), target populations, and COVID-19 epidemiologic conditions (including circulation of variants of concern) All COVID-19 vaccines in late phase development report high vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 and favourable safety profiles Most vaccines have high effectiveness against infection, including with the Delta variant The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been authorised in children aged 5 years by the US FDA, EU EMA, Australian TGA and Health Canada; and in those 12 years by the UK MHRA and NZ Medsafe, The EMA, MHRA and TGA have authorised the Moderna vaccine in those 12 years. WHO SAGE recommends that 1) immunocompromised persons should be offered an additional dose of all WHO EUL COVID-19 vaccines as part of an extended primary series; and 2) following the Sinovac and Sinopharm inactivated vaccines, a third dose of the same vaccine or a different vaccine should be offered as part of an extended primary series.1 ATAGI has recommended that immunocompromised persons in Australia receive a third dose as part of the primary series and booster doses of Pfizer/BioNTech be offered to all irrespective of the primary COVID-19 vaccine given.2,3 Boosters are recommended for all adults 18 years of age in the US and will be offered to all adults in the UK by January 2022.4,5 Mixed vaccine schedules (i.e. delivering different types of vaccine for the first and second dose) are under investigation as these could facilitate better protection against variants of concern and enable vaccination programs to continue if a particular vaccine is unavailable Seven intranasal vaccines are in development (6 live-attenuated viruses or virus-vectored vaccines; 1 protein subunit.6 These may be beneficial in preventing transmission (Page 15) A very rare clotting disorder with low platelets (Thrombosis with Thrombocytopaenia Syndrome - TTS) has been associated with the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines.7-9 The majority of cases fully recover with adequate treatment. The risk following the first dose of AstraZeneca vaccine has been estimated by the EMA as 1 in 100,000 and by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) as 1 in 50,000.10,11 Risk of TTS is much lower following the second dose of AstraZeneca vaccine: estimate in the UK is 1 in 1.5 million second doses.12 The risk of TTS following the first dose of Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been estimated as 1 in 319,000 in the USA13 The risk of myocarditis/pericarditis is increased following the second dose of Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, particularly in younger males, occurring in >1 in 20,000 males under 25 years of age.14 Highest rate in males 16-17 years of age following Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine but no clear difference in risk between Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech.15 There is a small increase in risk of myocarditis in females <30 and males >50 years of age. Data from Ontario, Canada, and the UK suggest higher rates following Moderna than Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. ATAGI in Australia continue to review the data. Appropriate communication on the benefit-risk profile of COVID-19 vaccines (Page 15) remains crucial to maintain confidence in immunisation programmes and to avoid vaccine hesitancy.

They can be either expected or unexpected. The vaccine may not actually cause the AEFI; it may occur coincidentally as millions of people are being vaccinated so some people may get sick after vaccination but this does not necessarily mean that it is due to the vaccine. Special investigations determine whether they are due to the vaccine. Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) are of scientific and medical concern that are found through active surveillance, that have the potential to be causally associated with a vaccine and that need to be carefully monitored and confirmed by further special studies. For all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following administration. *Details for AstraZeneca, Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson from product information sheets in SRA countries, based on data from clinical trials; Sinopharm, Sinovac and Bharat Biotech details from published clinical trials **The ITP cases are mostly without the thrombotic events characteristic of TTS ASTRAZENECA MODERNA PFIZER/BIONTECH JOHNSON & Adverse events following immunisation (AEFIs)* Very common (more than 1 in 10 people): headache, nausea, muscle pain, joint pain, injection site tenderness/ pain/ warmth/ itch, fatigue, malaise, fever, chills Common (between 1 in 10 and 1 in 100 people): injection site swelling/ redness119 Injection site pain (92%)/ swelling redness (10%), (70%), headache (65%), muscle pain, injection site pain/ swelling, fatigue, fever, chills; Common: nausea, injection site redness119 Uncommon (between 1 in 100 and 1 in 1000 people): lymphadenopathy, insomnia, pain in extremity of vaccinated arm, malaise, injection site itch; Rare: (between 1 in 1000 and 1 in 10,000): acute peripheral facial paralysis121 Injection site pain/ redness/ swelling, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, fever122 Injection site pain (16%)/ itch (1%)/ swelling (2%)/ pain (10.0%)/ redness (0%)/ swelling (0%)124 Very common: Injection site pain, fatigue, headache Common: Injection site erythema, myalgia, arthralgia, loss of appetite, nausea, chills Uncommon: Injection site swelling, fever19 Common: Injection site pain/redness/ itching, headache, fever, malaise, fatigue, body ache Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) Thrombosis with thrombocytopaenia syndrome (TTS) (see page 13 EMA PRAC: Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS)125 Immune thrombocytopaenia (ITP) Myopericarditis (most common in younger USA VAERS: myocarditis cases per million second doses: 18-24 in younger USA 20,000 males under 25 years of age14 Israel: 1 to 5 cases of myocarditis per 100,000 persons129,130 ITP**128 TTS (see page 14 for estimated risk) USA: Guillain-Barre Syndrome: 100 preliminary reports of GBS following 12.5 million doses of vaccine administered (mostly males >50 years)131 - - - - 15 Weekly COVID-19 Vaccine Updates Number 37, 9 December 2021 Serious Adverse Events Caution is required when comparing safety profiles as definitions and reporting systems vary in trials and in particular phase IV studies.
