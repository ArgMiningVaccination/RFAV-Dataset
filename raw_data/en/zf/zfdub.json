It is an opportunity for you to release the deep-rooted traumas and wounds that are in the way of your body's natural ability to heal. So you can move through the world reconnected to your ability to heal yourself. . On the first step of this journey, I invite you to step in and step up into a journey of self-love and self-awareness. I know this is a lofty ask because you, like me, were never shown or taught how to do it. I'm here to help you find your way. I'm here to help you reconnect to a deep self-nurturing and self-caring. To notice the guilt you feel when you even think about putting yourself first, and to gently unravel that guilt. Because, when you come first, everyone thrives. Soul Work Mind-Body Healing is the practice of tuning back into the connection of your Mind and Heart that is always there. To give yourself space to drop out of your head and into the heart - and feel that connection. This doesn't have to take a lot of time. You have families, work, life busyness, and lots of responsibility. This is about shifting how you move through the world. By having a safe space to be seen, be vulnerable, and feel, you will naturally begin to let your heart guide you. And this will allow you to experience less pain and a lot more joy. I've walked this path. I know its challenges. And I know the satisfaction and revitalization that comes from doing the heartfelt work required to heal so we can walk out on the other side into a life of true well-being and joy. My goal is to help you learn how to stay deeply connected to the inherent wisdom of your body so that you can live wholly aligned and your heart, mind, and soul have a healthy and vibrant temple in which to live. [Email me to book your first session!](mailto:Healing@cox.net) What's Waiting for You Through our work together, you can experience an increase in vitality and no longer ... - Feel the weight of responsibility - Feel the pressure to constantly provide for others - Be bothered by little things as you're connected to more depth and meaning And you'll have more and more moments of contentment, connection, alignment, happiness, and wholeness. Our work together helps you not only become aware of the core of the problem(s), but then it fully supports you so you can release the issue, relieve the body, soothe the heart and mind, and begin to truly heal. How We Can Work Together - A Series of Four 90-minute sessions I ask for a commitment of four, 90-minute session appointments because this work goes DEEP. In these 4 sessions, we'll dive in and root out the core of your struggle. We're not looking to treat only your symptoms but to cure the root. Each session builds on the previous. Humans are like onions; we need to be patient as we peel back the layers to get to the core ... because that is when true transformational healing can occur. After the initial 4 sessions, you're welcome to continue at a pace that feels perfect. [Email me to book your first session!](mailto:Healing@cox.net) What Does a Session Look Like? First, I'll invite you to set an intention for the work and the session. Then, I'll ask questions to understand what you're struggling with and what you hope to achieve and/or heal. From there, I'll determine what energy or spiritual healing modalities to use based on what you need in the moment. We'll work on a holistic level, often utilizing sound, scent, and touch to release energetic blockages that come up during the coaching. Here are some modalities I may use: - - Reiki Healing - Crystal Healing - Chakra Balancing - Chakra Balancing - Sound Healing (rattles, drumming, and/or singing bowls) - Smudging - Aromatherapy No two sessions will look alike because each person is unique \u2014 even from one session to the next! I focus on each client individually and I approach each session that way, too. We'll work together to peel back the layers so we can reveal your opportunity to heal.

I wanted to go back to counseling, but I didn't want traditional talk therapy. Your Soul Work Mind-Body Healing sessions were the perfect combination of counseling and healing. The Reiki component made it all come together on a spiritual level which is exactly what I wanted. I am amazed with this healing process \u2014 I want more!\" ~Michelle \"During my Soul Work Mind-Body Healing sessions with Kerri, I learned a number of things that helped me immensely. Kerri's recommendations, ranging from self-love/self-care, to literature to read, medical professionals, to see, and daily routine changes, I have been given a chance to explore how to be in charge of my own healing and health. Kerri provides a judgment-free zone allowing you to feel 100% safe about expressing what you currently need to work on \u2014 the first step to take on the healing journey. I always look forward to my sessions, but the part I enjoyed the most was where Kerri does energetic healing. To feel the energy my body craved badly was something truly unique. I walk out of the session feeling energized, balanced, and truly at peace. In the two months since I started working with Kerri, I can acknowledge growth and progress; it's incredibly rewarding. I definitely recommend working with Kerri to ANYONE who is looking to improve their health and themselves.\" ~Danielle \"Kerri has been an incredible guide on my healing journey. Her active listening skills when coaching are extremely helpful. Before working with Kerri, I felt like my energy was blocked; I felt lost. The combination of coaching and hands-on energy work rocked my world! I have gained a greater awareness of the deep connection between my physical and emotional pain and now understand how deeply rooted this connection actually is. Kerri's Soul Work Mind-Body Healing sessions have been instrumental in releasing my blocks; the log jam is moving and my energy is flowing again, including my creative juices! Kerri provides a safe and comfortable space for healing. She's empathetic, sensitive, and trustworthy. I highly recommend anyone who is in need of guidance and healing and who are open to non-traditional and holistic therapeutic techniques to work with Kerri.\" ~Diane Healing in Harmony "}
