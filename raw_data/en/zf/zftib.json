Also known as the violin or fiddleback spider for its distinctive fiddle-shaped markings, the brown recluse spider has long, thin legs and a bulbous, velvety abdomen. Lurking in a woodpile or basement, the shy spider hides in the dark. Rare in Connecticut's cool climate, the elusive creature is one of several species that cause susceptible individuals to develop necrotic arachnidism, in which the spider's venom strangles small arteries, cutting off blood supply to the bite area and setting up a terrifying cycle of flesh-destroy - ing ulceration and skin sloughing. \"Many other medical conditions are wrongly diagnosed as brown recluse spider bites,\" warns medical toxicologist Charles McKay, Jr., M.D., \"including the cutaneous anthrax case in New York City in 2001.\" Seek immediate medical help if a spider bite pro - duces an immediate stinging sensation followed by intense pain or a ragged bluish lesion ringed by swollen redness, since a severe bite can lead to tissue necrosis, skin grafts, amputation or death.Hartford Hospital provides comprehensive clinical educational rotation opportunities for University of Connecticut (UConn) third- and fourth-year medical students in most of the medical spe - cialties. Similar advanced educational opportunities are offered to residents and fellows participating in University-sponsored graduate medical education programs in addition to individuals participating in Hartford Hospital-sponsored programs in radiology, psychiatry, pathology and dentistry. \"Hartford Hospital is a major academic teaching hospital that provides clinical rotations in most of the medical and surgical specialties for medical students, residents, and fellows,\" says Vice President for Academic Affairs Neil S. Yeston, M.D., of Hartford Hos - pital, a professor of surgery at UConn. \"Research and education are essential for our commitment to deliver superior patient care. In ad - dition, our ability to attract the 'best and the brightest' (physicians) is in no small measure the result of these two activities that are at the core of our mission and vision. Moreover, each year graduating residents and fellows are asked to rank the quality of their clinical and educational experience at all of the affiliated hospitals where they receive training\u2014Hartford Hospital consistently has been at the top of the list.\" BEWARE the Brown Recluse 2Before navigating the body's unknown terrain, surgeons study the inner landscape. In Hartford Hospital's 3D Laboratory, the same technology used by NASA to beam satellite images back to earth creates a three-dimen - sional contour map of everything that lies beneath the skin. Innovations in the speed and sophistication of digital imaging have revolutionized the clarity and resolution of medical CT, MRI and PET/CT scans, revealing organs, musculature, bones and blood vessels in exquisite anatomi - cal detail. Physicians can strip away skin and muscle, spin the skeleton, rotate organs or zero in on suspicious lesions. Misshapen veins, blocked arteries, bulging aneurysms and hidden tumors all give up their secrets. In a single rotation lasting about a third of a second, the hospital's LightSpeed VCT scanner acquires 64 \"slices\" of anatomical data, many times faster than conventional multi-slice CT (\"cat\") scanners. The VCT (the \"V\" stands for volume) captures a beating heart in five heartbeats or an organ in a single second. Hartford Hospital has also spearheaded advances in 3D MRI technology to image parts of the body\u2014the heart and vascular (circulatory) system\u2014 in motion. \"The human eye can't easily assimilate nuanced images from slices of two-dimensional data,\" explains Barry Stein, Imaging the Future Hartford Hospital's 3D Image Laboratory M.D., an interventionalist who is the director of Cardiovas - cular MRI and CT, and director of the hospital's Advanced Imaging Analysis and 3D Laboratory. That's where the computer comes in. \"Think of multiple slices of bread,\" says Dr. Stein. \"Assembling all the slices creates a whole loaf. Instead of a thousand flat slices, the computer compiles segments into an animated image that is not only three-dimensional, but truly four-dimensional\u2014we capture an image moving and changing over time.\" In the twilight darkness of the 3D lab, ultra-fast micro - processors whirr quietly as physicians scrutinize high-reso - lution digitized images on a wall of flat-screen monitors overhead. Using sophisticated software tools, radiologists manipulate an image to study an irregularly shaped tumor or map its precise spatial relationship to nearby vital organs, or zoom in to view an aneurysm with more accuracy than an invasive angiogram. Doctors not only view the images in the 3D lab, but can also call up archived images remotely on workstations in the emergency department or operating room, or even on office or home computers. \"Wherever you are, image-display is available on demand,\" says Dr. Stein. \"The imaging and access we have at Hartford Hospital are totally unique in the state.\"\"The imaging and access we have at Hartford Hospital are totally unique in the state.\" BEWARE the Brown Recluse \u0018Five months after his successful weight-loss surgery, John Rexroad of Killingworth credits Dr. Darren Tishler with helping him lose 100 pounds. The 47-year-old business owner no longer has trouble fitting into airline seats or restau - rant booths. Hartford Hospital's active support group was invaluable to the self-described \"stress eater,\" who had hyper- tension, high cholesterol and early diabetes when he tipped the scales at over 300 pounds. With encouragement from dad, Rexroad's daughter will soon undergo the surgery.Americans are bulging over their belts, stretching their spandex to the bursting point. Across the nation, waistlines are widening\u2014and obesity-related health care costs are soaring. Diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancers linked to obesity are reducing life expec - tancy and forcing hospitals to super-size beds and wheelchairs. In 1998, the World Health Organization warned that obesity had become a global epidemic. Ap - proximately 127 million Americans are overweight and 60 million are obese, according to the latest data from the National Institutes of Health. Mor - bid obesity\u2014generally more than 100 pounds over ideal weight\u2014afflicts nine million Americans. Obesity affects every organ system, disrupts endocrine function, weakens joints and muscles, taxes hearts and overburdens lungs. Excess weight accounts for an estimated 70 percent of the diabetes risk in the United States. Dense fatty tissue makes diagnostic X-rays difficult to read, while obese patients find it nearly impossible to squeeze into CT scanners or MRI tubes. Overweight individuals endure workplace discrimination, cruel stares, and agonies of remorse about their inabil - ity to stick to a diet. The Diabetes Crisis Obesity prevalence has doubled since 1980, afflict - ing more than 30 percent of Americans\u2014nearly a third of all adults in the United States. In lockstep with obesity, diabetes is skyrocketing around the globe. \"Obesity is increasing in this country at a dramatic rate,\" says Kiran R. Ubriani, M.D., an endocrinologist with Connecticut Multispecialty Group. \"Since obesity is such a strong risk factor for diabetes, preventing obesity may potentially avert subsequent diabetes.\"Nestled just behind the stomach is the pancreas, which makes the insulin that allows the body to utilize glucose (sugar) in food for energy. Diabetes sufferers either can't make enough insulin or can't use the hormone effectively. Obese individuals tend to have insulin resistance, which means that it takes more insulin for the body to respond normally. Diabetes affects an estimated 20 million Ameri - cans, with more than five million unaware that they have the disease. Even with treatment, diabetes can lead to cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, nerve damage, erectile dysfunction, stroke, blind - ness and lower-extremity amputations. Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States. Type 1 diabetes usually strikes in childhood, when the body produces too little insulin to regu - late blood sugar levels. Type 1 diabetes is a lifelong endocrine disorder whose symptoms include exces - sive thirst, frequent urination, weight loss, blurred vision and fatigue. Type 2 diabetes, which accounts for more than 90 percent of all diabetes cases, can arise at any age when the body loses its ability to utilize insulin properly. Warning signs of type 2 diabetes include drowsiness, itching, excess weight, tingling numb - Waging War on Obesity Risks of Obesity Type 2 diabetes Metabolic syndrome Cardiovascular disease Hypertension Stroke Poor circulation Erectile dysfunction Infertility Breast, ovarian, colon and uterine cancer Breast cancer recurrence Osteoarthritis Joint-replacement surgery Post-surgical complications Gallbladder disease Sleep apnea and respiratory problems Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Urinary incontinencecontinues on next page \u0018ness in the feet, skin infections and slow healing. An overweight per - son is 10 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than is someone of normal weight. Even more worrisome is the epidemic of overweight kids. \"Rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes are rising significantly in children,\" says Dr. Ubriani. Since 1980, the number of overweight adolescents has tripled in the United States. \"Physicians are seeing very young people\u2014even children\u2014with type 2 diabetes,\" adds Darren Tishler, M.D., director of Hartford Hospital's surgical weight-loss program. \"It used to be called adult-onset diabetes because people developed the disease later in life. People whose par - ents developed diabetes at 50 are now being diagnosed at age 25.\" \"The rate of diabetes has gone up, as expected, with increased obe - sity,\" notes Dr. Ubriani. \"Surprisingly, the rate of undiagnosed diabetes has stayed the same despite more diabetes awareness programs. We need to do a better job of screening anyone who is overweight or obese, has a sedentary lifestyle or a family history of diabetes. African Ameri - cans and Hispanic Americans are at high risk for diabetes, as are those over age 65, and women with a history of diabetes during pregnancy.\" Diabetes increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, even when glucose levels are under control. Poorly controlled diabetes during pregnancy can lead to complications for both mother and baby. About three-quarters of people with diabetes die of some form of heart or blood vessel disease. Metabolic syndrome\u2014marked by obesity, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and high blood sugar\u2014often precedes diabetes. Diabetes also reduces circulation and damages nerves in the feet. Painful and debilitating neuropathy, or nerve impairment, causes diabetics to lose feeling in their feet. Because the disease slows heal - ing, even a simple blister or a minor injury can lead to a life-threaten - ing infection. Each year in the United States, 85,000 lower limbs are amputated because of complications of diabetes, says Larry A. Suecof, D.P.M., a podiatrist who specializes in diabetic and vascular foot care. At Hartford Hospital's Center for Wound Healing and Hyperbaric Medi - cine, innovative treatments for diabetic wounds include growth-factor medications, bio-engineered skin substitutes, and hyperbaric oxygen in the only chamber of its kind located within a medical facility in the New England region. Rapid and tight control of blood sugar is critical to avoiding com - plications from untreated diabetes. When blood sugar levels spike to dangerous highs, diabetics risk damage to blood vessels and nerves, and ultimately diabetic coma and death. Over time, high blood sugar levels increase the risk of infection, while nerve damage causes stom - ach problems and loss of sexual function. The Diabetes LifeCare program, which stresses self-management of the disease, grew out of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, a 10-year research study that showed that better control of blood sugar decreases long-term complications. With support from Hartford Hospital donors, the collaborative program blends continuing education Kiran R. Ubriani, M.D.PHYSICIAN PROFILE Dr. Ubriani recently joined Connecticut Multispecialty Group as an endocrinologist specializing in diabetes and metabolic disorders. She received her Board certification in Internal Medicine in 200 \u0018 and in Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism in 200 \u0018. She earned her B.A. in biology at Wellesley College. A graduate of the medical school at the State University of New York at Syracuse, Dr. Ubriani did her residency in internal medicine and pediatrics at the Medical College of Virginia, followed by a fellowship in endocrinology and metabolism at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. While completing her schoolwork and medical training, Dr. Ubriani was an active volunteer at a clinic for homeless people called Salt City Hope in Syracuse, and as a trained counselor at a free HIV clinic that provides counseling and testing. An avid runner, she completed the famed Marine Corps marathon, held in Arlington, Virginia, which annually draws more than 18,000 runners. She is currently training to run 1 \u0018.1 miles in the upcoming Hartford half-marathon in October. \u0018classes, special events, support groups and counseling sessions to help individuals achieve control over their diabetes. As researchers seek ways to combat the devastating long-term ef - fects of the disease, innovative treatments are making life easier for diabetics. Needles have become smaller and thinner, reducing pain at injection sites. \"For those who already have diabetes, inhaled insulin is an exciting new treatment,\" says Dr. Ubriani. \"For the first time, pa - tients can give themselves insulin without an injection. The short-acting powder form of insulin is inhaled to help lower blood sugar levels after meals. Other new drug classes include glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) agonists that appear to stimulate the body's ability to produce insulin in response to elevated levels of blood glucose, while promoting weight loss.\" Hartford Hospital is incubating the technology of Genomas, a company that is developing novel diagnostic products to aid in treating metabolic syndrome in partnership with Paul Thompson, M.D., director of Cardiology at Hartford Hospital. \"Our goal is to go beyond drug therapy,\" says Gualberto Rua\u00f1o, M.D., Ph.D., president of Genomas. \"We want to prevent obesity.\" Morbid Obesity When supervised dieting, exercise and behavior modification fail, weight- loss surgery offers new hope for morbidly obese patients who often tip the scales at 300 pounds or more. \"Weight-loss surgery can often allevi - ate obesity-related conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol relatively quickly,\" says Dr. Tishler, director of Hartford Hospital's weight-loss surgery program. \"The sooner someone has surgery after a diagnosis of diabetes, the better. Surgery may reduce the need for insulin or eliminate diabetes medications altogether.\" Weight-loss surgery is performed using minimally invasive laparoscopic tech - niques that require only tiny incisions. For those who prefer a reversible procedure rather than the permanent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, Dr. Tishler employs the adjust - able LAP-BAND technique that requires no cutting of the stomach or intestine. \"Even a slower weight loss after LAP-BAND surgery dramatically improves glyce - mic control,\" says Dr. Tishler. \"Nothing works better for diabetes than significant long-term weight loss.\"Are You Obese? Waist circumference measurement and body mass index (BMI) can help you estimate body fat. A high-risk waistline is 35 inches or higher for women, and 40 inches or higher for men. BMI is calculated in kg/m2. Multiply weight in pounds by 703, divide by height in inches, then divide again by height in inches. BMI 25 to 30 = overweight 30+ = obese 35+ = morbidly obeseGENOMAS \"One-third of patients develop dia - betes as a direct result of treatment for schizophrenia or other major psychiatric illness,\" says Gualberto Rua\u00f1o, M.D., Ph.D., president and founder of the biomedical firm Genomas. The company has received funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to understand why certain schizophrenia medications trigger diabetes. So-called \"atypical\" antipsychotic drugs for major psychiatric disorders are FDA-approved for schizophre - nia, bipolar disorder and psychotic depression, and now are increasingly being prescribed for other psychoses, dementia and obsessive-compulsive disorder in both adults and children. The atypical antipsychotics fre - quently cause rapid weight gain lead - ing to metabolic changes and diabetes. Brand-name drugs linked to Clozaril, Risperdal, Seroquel, and Abilify. Genomas is creating diagnostic systems for \"DNA-guided\" medicine to help physicians tailor medications to an individual's genetic markers. \"Genomas is exploring ways to prevent metabolic syndrome and diabetes by identifying genetic markers in the blood for both risk and protection,\" says Dr. Rua\u00f1o. With funding from NIH and Hartford Hospital grants, Genomas is collaborating with John W. Goethe, M.D., director of the Burlingame Center for Psychiatric Research and Education at the Institute of Living, to investigate genetic links to metabolic syndrome\u2014obesity, high cholesterol and high blood sugar\u2014in patients taking anti-psychotic drugs. \"The Institute of Living is at the forefront nationally in research into how these powerful drugs affect not just the brain, but the whole body,\" says Dr. Rua\u00f1o. \"We work closely with psychiatrists to select the best option to treat their mental illness without adding the risk of diabetes.\" Call (860) 545-7329 to participate in a study on Zyprexa and weight gain.DNA-Guided Medicine \u0018Jack Foster, M.D.SIR-Spheres: Living Longer with Liver CancerArthur Cores has always been a lucky guy. At 23, he co-founded the Boston Chicken chain\u2014rotis - serie birds and home-cooked mashed potatoes were a fast-food innovation\u2014and by 35 had cashed out and retired. Still, when he was diagnosed with metastatic liver cancer, the 45-year-old faced a grim prognosis. \"Three years ago, it didn't look good,\" recalls Cores. \"Even after radiation and chemotherapy, the tumor was still growing in my liver. My oncologist at Dana-Far - ber Cancer Institute in Boston said my only hope was a procedure in which doctors inject tiny radioactive spheres into the bloodstream to destroy tumors.\" Cores was lucky enough to have a physician for a spouse. \"The Dana Farber doctors told us Dr. Jack Fos - ter was the man to see in the Northeast,\" recalls Cores' partner, John Yee, M.D. Jack Foster, M.D., an interven - tional radiologist with Hartford Hospital and Jefferson Radiology, brought the SIR-Spheres\u00ae procedure to New England in 2003. \"My PET scan after treatment showed no detectable cancer,\" adds Cores. \"The scan can't detect very tiny spots, but I can be re-treated if necessary.\" \"As a physician, I was impressed with everything about Hartford Hospital,\" says Dr. Yee. \"Dr. Foster was warm and professional. The team approach in the radi - ology department provided wonderful patient care.\" At Hartford Hospital, interventional radiologists collaborate with radiation oncologists to bring new approaches to treating liver cancer. The team provides comprehensive care for cancer patients with tumors that start in the liver (primary cancers) or those that spread there from other parts of the body (metastatic liver cancer). Liver cancer has been notoriously dif - ficult to treat because the delicate organ cannot be bombarded with too much conventional radiation or harmful doses of chemotherapy. Specialists offer individually tailored treatment approaches, including hepatic resectional surgery, liver transplant, cryoablation, chemoembolization (injec - tion of high concentrations of chemotherapy into the liver and blockage of the blood supply to give the chemotherapy maximum impact), external irradiation utilizing intensity modulated therapy and now Selec - tive Internal Radiation (SIR)-Sphere therapy. The innovative therapy delivers a tumor-busting blast of radiation directly to the cancer. Tiny spheri -cal plastic beads tightly bound with a radioisotope called yttrium-90 are used to selectively irradi - ate tumors without damaging sensitive structures. Angiography identifies the tumor's feeding vessels to pinpoint delivery with minimal toxicity. Radia - tion oncologists take repeated scans to measure the volume of the tumor and fine-tune the dose. Before injecting the radioisotope\u2014usually as a single dose\u2014 the interventional radiologist blocks off collateral blood vessels that could carry harmful radioactivity to other organs. \"SIR-Spheres are delivered through a catheter directly to the hepatic artery, where they are selec - tively trapped in tumor blood vessels and don't stick in normal blood vessels,\" says director of radiation oncology Andrew L. Salner, M.D., who heads the Cancer Program at the Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center. \"Because radiation isotopes are targeted directly to the tumor, the radiation dose can be 8-10 times higher than would be possible with external radiation.\" Spurred by a worldwide surge in hepatitis B and C infections, primary liver cancer rates are rising. Once rare in the U.S., a hepatitis-linked liver cancer called hepatoma is becoming more prevalent. \"Hepatoma is now the most common cancer in the world,\" says Dr. Foster. \"People infected with hepatitis B and C typically have a 10- to 15-year latency period before cancer develops, and may have no symptoms until a tumor has reached considerable size.\" SIR-Spheres are FDA-approved for colorectal can - cer liver metastases. Cancer spreads to the liver in a significant number of the nearly 150,000 Americans diagnosed with colorectal cancer every year, but few liver tumors can be surgically removed. \"Meta - static liver cancer can significantly affect a patient's longevity and sense of well-being,\" says Dr. Salner. \"Microspheres therapy has emerged as a treatment for patients with advanced liver cancer when other treatment options have failed.\" \"SIR-Spheres have been proven to extend patient survival times for one of the deadliest forms of cancer,\" adds Dr. Foster. \"In the past we were able to offer patients few treatment options. Now we have a palliative therapy that doubles life expectancy while allowing patients to maintain a good quality of life.\"PIONEERING PROCEDURES \"The Dana Farber doctors told us Dr. Jack Foster was the man to see in the Northeast.\" \u0018 | in the DOCTOR'S OFFICE | WHAT'S GOING AROUND...News & BreakthroughsNew Vaccine Prevents Cervical Cancer Tell Someone! More than half of all sexually active individuals have been infected with one or more types of human papillomavirus (HPV), usually in their teens and 20s. While most are relatively harmless, high-risk HPV strains 1 \u0018 and 18 can cause cervical cancer. \"Gardasil is the first vaccine specifically designed to prevent cancer,\" explains gynecologist Linda Taylor, M.D. \"The vaccine protects against the most common HPV strains that cause cervical, vulvar and vaginal cancers, as well as genital warts. HPV 1 \u0018 and 18 are responsible for \u0018\u0018 to \u00180 percent of cervical cancers, while strains \u0018 and 11 cause 80 percent of genital warts.\" Although not life-threatening, genital warts are difficult to eradicate and frequently recur if the HPV virus persists. The Pap test detects abnormal cells on the cervix before cancer can develop, but the new Gardisil vaccine could dramatically reduce the nearly 4,000 cervical cancer deaths in the United States each year. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that females ages 11 to 2 \u0018 be given a series of three vaccinations. Despite opposition from some conservative groups, the FDA approved the vaccine for girls as young as \u0018. The vaccine is most effective when given to girls prior to becoming sexually active. Gardisil should not be given to pregnant women or women who plan to become pregnant within the next six months. \"You allow your daughter to be vaccinated for Hepatitis B,\" says Dr. Taylor, \"so why wouldn't you protect her against HPV? They're both sexually transmitted diseases. Eventually I hope the FDA will expand the recommendation to include males as well as any individual at risk.\" Sausage Links The more processed meat you eat, the more likely you are to get stomach cancer, warns the Journal of the Na - tional Cancer Institute. While no one has proven that pro - cessed meats cause cancer, 15 studies linked stomach cancer with bacon, sausage, hot dogs, salami, ham and smoked or cured meat. Stud - ies didn't adjust for infec - tion with Helicobacter pylori , a significant cause of ulcer disease, known to raise stomach cancer risk.IVIg vs. Alzheimer's Long used to treat immune disorders and a type of leukemia, IVIg (intravenous immunoglobulin or gamma globulin) is a thick soup of antibodies made from blood plasma. While still experimental, research - ers at New York-Presbyte - rian/Weill Cornell Medical Center's Memory Disorders Program hope IVIg may slow the mental decline of Alzheimer's disease by clear - ing amyloid deposits that disrupt nerve function in aging brains.Scleroderma Success The drug Cytoxan mod - estly slowed skin thickening and deterioration of lung function in scleroderma sufferers, reports the New England Journal of Medicine. Ongoing research is adding to the arsenal of drugs and chemotherapy to treat the skin-stiffening autoimmune disorder, which can scar lungs and ravage internal organs. Stem cell trans - plants, while still experi - mental and expensive, show promise for the 300,000 Americans with the disease. Sugar Shock Drinking an extra can of sugary soda daily can add up to a weight gain of 15 pounds in a single year, say Harvard School of Public Health researchers. Soda packs on pounds a lot faster than milk does, experts warn, and the average Americans gets about 50% more calories daily from soda than from milk. A 12-ounce can of soda is equivalent to 10 teaspoons of table sugar. 10More than a quarter of chil - dren refuse to go to school at some point, but persistent de - fiance brings frantic phone calls, truancy officers and desperate parents. School refusal is not a psychiatric diagnosis, although kids who refuse to go to school often show signs of anxiety or other mental health problems. Approximately one to two percent of both boys and girls\u2014and as many as six percent of children receiving mental health services\u2014refuse to attend classes or remain in school for an entire day without a support person present. While clingy younger kids may want to stay home with mom or fear rid - ing a school bus, teenagers may have complex social reasons for avoiding school. With support from Hartford Hospital donors, the Anxiety Disorders Center at the Institute of Living (IOL) not only provides treatment, but also conducts research into problems that have been little studied. \"Ours is one of only a handful of school refusal programs,\" says David F. Tolin, Ph.D., director of the Anxi - ety Disorders Center. \"Children often show a rapid response to daily treatment. Our goal is to get kids back to school as quickly as possible rather than stretching once-a-week treat - ment over months.\" The intensive school re - fusal program is a collaboration between the Anxiety Disorders Center and the Grace S. Webb School, a private special educa - tion facility at the IOL. School refusers work with a therapist to develop strategies\u2014gradual exposure to feared situations, skills training and anxiety management\u2014for transitioning back to school. Members of the IOL treatment team may even accompany the student to public school. By the beginning of the second week, it is expected that the child will begin to attend school at least some of the time. Research shows that cogni - tive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can be an effective psychologi - cal treatment for anxiety and behavioral disorders, particularly when intervention occurs early. Exposure-based CBT is the most effective known psychological treatment for anxiety disorders. \"The objective is to gain mastery over a difficult social situation,\" says Dr. Tolin. \"Role-playing allows students to practice social skills, while CBT helps them learn to think in a logical, rational manner.\" School can be boring for some, while at home skate - boards and the Xbox beckon. To combat school refusal, parents must learn to set limits and use privileges as rewards for school attendance. \"Parents can make staying home less enjoyable,\" says Dr. Tolin. \"When adults take the TV, stereo, electronic games and computer out of the child's room and make kids do chores if they stay home, they'll often want to go to school.\" While school refusal tends to peak at ages 5-6 and 10-11, corresponding with entry into first grade or transitioning into middle school, the IOL program targets intractable truants who are age 12 or older. The cost of the program is billed directly to the public school system. \"School refusal is often a way of seeking attention from parents,\" says Dr. Tolin, \"but without treatment, it may have lifelong consequences. School refusers are less likely to go to college, and are more likely to have oc - cupational and marital problems, to behave criminally and abuse alcohol, or to experience chronic anxiety or depression.\"Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel And shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school. \u2014 Shakespeare, As You Like It Why Johnny Won't Go to School 11Hartford Hospital Programs & Events From September 15 through December 15, 2006 Call the Health/Physician Referral Service at (860) 545-1888 or (800) 545-7664 for information about any program.

Among the alarming adverse health effects associated with obesity are rising rates of coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes and colon cancer. Apples are high in cancer-fighting vitamin C, a form of vitamin A called beta- carotene , boron (a trace element that hardens bone) and fiber. As the old adage says, an apple a day can lower blood choles - terol and improve bowel function, while reducing the risk of stroke, prostate cancer, type 2 diabetes and asthma. Pumpkins and winter squash\u2014acorn, Hubbard and but - ternut\u2014are rich sources of dietary fiber and beta-carotene (the bright orange flesh indicates high beta- carotene content). When choosing squash or pumpkins, look for rich color and a firm, hard skin. Green acorn squash should be a deep, dull green, not shiny or speckled, while butternuts should have a deep, even color.Ingredients \u00bd cup chopped onion 1\u00be cup apple cider 13 cup thinly sliced carrot 1 tsp. instant chicken bouillon granules 2 cups cooked and mashed acorn or butternut squash, or 1 can (16 oz.) pumpkin 1 cup skim milk 1 tsp. lemon juice \u00bc tsp. white pepper \u00bc tsp. ground ginger, or to taste black pepper to taste fat-free sour cream (approx. 4 oz.)
