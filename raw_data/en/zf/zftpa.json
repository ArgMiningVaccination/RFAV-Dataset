Aquaporins 1, 3 and 8 Expression and Cytokines in Irritable Bowel Syndrome Rats' Colon via cAMP-PKA Pathway 17 Pages Posted: 6 Sep 2018 [More...](javascript:void(0);) Abstract Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. The cAMP-PKA pathway plays a key role in mediating cell responses to various stimuli both of which might play an important role in IBS. Objective: Our research was to detect the mechanism of IBS rat models via cAMP-PKA pathway so as to further detect the mechanism of IBS. Methods: IBS rats were built by stress and the conditioned stimulus. The study was divided into 3 groups( control group, model group, forskolin group ). The expressions of AQP1, AQP3, AQP8 and CREB(Serl33) in the colon of rats were detected by immunohistochemical technique. The expressions of AQP1, AQP3, AQP8, IL-1,TGF and TNF in the colon were detected by PCR technique. Results: The IBS rats were built successfully. The expressions of AQP1, AQP3, AQP8 and CREB(Serl33) were down-regulated in the colon of IBS rats and were up-regulated with the intervention of the activator of AMP(p<0.05). The expressions of IL-1 TGF and TNF were up-regulated in the colon of IBS rats and were down-regulated with the intervention of the activator of AMP(p<0.05). Conclusions: The release of inflammatory cytokines, the activation of the immune system and liquid water metabolic abnormalities are the mechanisms of IBS via cAMP-PKA pathway.
