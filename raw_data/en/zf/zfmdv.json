Travel [vaccines](https://www.rxlist.com/vaccines/definition.htm) are vaccines administered to protect against certain [bacterial](https://www.rxlist.com/bacterial/definition.htm) and [viral](https://www.rxlist.com/viral/definition.htm) infections for travelers to places with [endemic](https://www.rxlist.com/endemic/definition.htm) infectious diseases. Vaccines stimulate the [immune system](https://www.rxlist.com/immune_system/definition.htm) to produce antibodies against specific types of [bacteria](https://www.rxlist.com/bacteria/definition.htm) and [viruses](https://www.rxlist.com/viruses/definition.htm) from which the vaccines are derived. Travel vaccines include both viral and bacterial vaccines which may be live or inactivated. Live vaccines are weakened forms of the actual viruses or bacteria and provide strong and often life-long [immunity](https://www.rxlist.com/immunity/definition.htm) similar to a natural [infection](https://www.rxlist.com/infection/definition.htm), but may not be safe for persons with compromised [immune](https://www.rxlist.com/immune/definition.htm) systems. Inactivated vaccines are made from [proteins](https://www.rxlist.com/proteins/definition.htm) or fragments of the [disease](https://www.rxlist.com/disease/definition.htm)-causing germs, but killed to prevent [replication](https://www.rxlist.com/replication/definition.htm). Inactivated vaccines contain the bacterial or viral [antigen](https://www.rxlist.com/antigen/definition.htm) which stimulates the production of antibodies without the risk of the disease itself, but may not produce as strong immunity as live vaccines do. Travel vaccines protect against the following infectious diseases: [Hepatitis A](https://www.rxlist.com/hepatitis_a/definition.htm)and [B virus](https://www.rxlist.com/b_virus/definition.htm)infections, bacteria serogroups A, C, Y and W-135 [Polio](https://www.rxlist.com/polio/definition.htm)( [poliomyelitis](https://www.rxlist.com/poliomyelitis/definition.htm)), a disabling disease caused by [poliovirus](https://www.rxlist.com/poliovirus/definition.htm) [Rabies](https://www.rxlist.com/rabies/definition.htm), caused by the rabies [virus](https://www.rxlist.com/virus/definition.htm)that is transmitted when bitten or scratched by rabid animals [Typhoid fever](https://www.rxlist.com/typhoid_fever/definition.htm), caused by [Salmonella](https://www.rxlist.com/salmonella/definition.htm)typhi [Yellow fever](https://www.rxlist.com/yellow_fever/definition.htm), a disease spread by mosquitoes, affects the liver How are travel vaccines used?
