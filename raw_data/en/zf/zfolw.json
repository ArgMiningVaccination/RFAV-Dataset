However, it's likely that your doctors will ask that you completely change up your usual routine. The same drugs that kill off the cancer cells also affect the growth of your skin cells. Most people know about the [hair loss](https://www.self.com/story/why-chemo-patients-choose-cold-cap-therapy) that comes with chemo, but treatment can also result in dull, graying skin that's dry, sensitive, and irritated. Cancerous cells grow and multiply at a faster rate than healthy cells in the body. Chemotherapy drugs stop the cancerous cells from growing and multiplying, but healthy cells are affected, too. \"Chemo medicines are strong, and they tend to affect the cells in the body that are growing most actively,\" Marisa Weiss, M.D., oncologist and founder of [Breastcancer.org](http://www.breastcancer.org/about_us/team/marisa_weiss), tells SELF. \"Skin cells are growing and replenishing themselves all the time.\" And that makes them targets for the ravages of chemo. \"When you are on chemo, your skin cells don't replace themselves like they normally would and your skin becomes fragile and dry,\" dermatologist and breast cancer survivor [Cynthia Bailey, M.D.](https://www.drbaileyskincare.com/), tells SELF. Your complexion can also change during treatment, looking gray or yellow. \"Cuticles become brittle and crack, nails don't grow, and hair often falls out,\" Bailey adds. Weiss also points out that other side effects from chemo can directly and indirectly impact your skin and nails. For example, the drug Seloda is known to cause hands and feet to get red and hypersensitive. Another class of medicines, called taxanes, can cause nails to lift up off the finger bed and look discolored, she says. Patients who have trouble keeping food down due to nausea from the chemotherapy medicine may become dehydrated, which can make skin dry and wrinkly. These issues go beyond cosmetic concerns. Overall, there's an increased risk of infection when your skin and immune system are compromised by chemo. \"Because skin is your largest organ and essential for protecting you from external risks such as infection, there is a risk that infection and irritant rashes will break open the skin's now fragile protective barrier,\" says Bailey. Weiss adds that \"the disruption of the skin around the fingernail could be a source of infection.\" (The best solution is to trim nails short so they don't snag on anything. If you're [prone to picking](https://www.self.com/story/9-tips-for-managing-a-body-focused-repetitive-behavior-from-people-who-have-them) as a nervous habit, try wearing gloves over your hands.) The best thing to do is to change up your skin routine to rely on simple, moisturizing products for [sensitive skin](https://www.self.com/story/sensitive-skin-facts-dermatologists). All of the rules that apply to sensitive skin are true for those going through chemotherapy. Search for products that are gentle, hydrating, and hypoallergenic. Avoid common allergens like fragrance, alcohol, preservatives, and botanical essential oils, which can be irritating or, even worse, cause an allergic reaction. \"You must avoid harsh ingredients that remove skin lipids and lead to irritation and a broken skin barrier,\" Bailey says. That means giving up your [exfoliating regimen](https://www.self.com/story/chemical-exfoliants). \"Exfoliating products remove skin build-up of dead cells and that process is not happening,\" says Bailey. So skip the scrubs, AHAs, and glycolic acid. Also put your [retinol](https://www.self.com/story/drugstore-retinol-products) routine on pause. And as always (but even more than usual), [sun protection](https://www.self.com/story/i-tried-to-follow-sunscreen-instructions-perfectly-and-realized-ive-been-using-it-wrong-my-entire-life) is an essential. \"Many chemo drugs and other drugs you are given during chemo can cause sun allergy,\" says Bailey. \"I recommend the hypoallergenic zinc oxide physical sunscreens.\" Weiss tells her patients to protect the body with a wide brim hat, long-sleeve clothes, and even sun-protective gloves. Her favorite trick is to use a men's cotton button-down shirt to cover the hands and neck while you're out and about, because it's both cool and stylish. Related: [11 Genuinely Helpful Gifts to Get "}
