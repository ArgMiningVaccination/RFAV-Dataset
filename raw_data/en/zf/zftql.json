Likewise, there are ways of understanding healing that can, to the typical mind, seem completely random - unless you have eyes for magic. Recently, I've been leading some people through a healing program, and I began to really see how there are energetic patterns and synchronicities in the way healing works that even I had never fully explored before. And so, when I began to think more broadly about patterns, one thing that has become really interesting to me, is the link that can be seen between Traditional Chinese Medicine and the fragrance notes of essential oils. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, there are 3 levels of Qi (consciousness/experience) - called Wei, Ying and Yuan - and, quite magically, these levels also relate to the fragrance notes of essential oils - Top, Middle and Bottom notes. So, in this month's article, we thought we would share the connection and what it offers us to supercharge our healing. Read on for an exploration of each level of Qi and its corresponding fragrance note - and what these can be used to support, along with blends for each. Top note essential oils - Wei Qi level Wei Qi level oils are Top Note oils. Top notes are distilled from the outer parts of plants, like peels and leaves, and it is here that we can most significantly see how this relates to the Wei Qi level as this is all to do with our outer and most superficial level of consciousness and experience. Top Notes are like the first impression - the surface layer - of an aroma, with thin viscosity. The Wei level has an affinity with lungs and breath and is associated with outer consciousness. Its corresponding Top Note oils are those which have an effect on acute upper body conditions - for example, those which treat common colds - as well as oils inhaled to awaken and uplift moods. These notes evaporate quickly, without penetrating Ying or Yuan levels - the synchronicity being that there is only a surface level depth to these oils. If you are feeling the need for support in this area, here are some beautiful Top Note blends to create balance: Wei Qi blend for colds When experiencing symptoms, diffuse a blend of 4 drops [Eucalyptus](https://www.baseformula.com/eucalyptus-globulus-essential-oil), 2 drops Sweet Orange and 1 drop Lemon in an electrical aromatherapy diffuser or candle burner to get the energy flowing in the direction of balance. Wei Qi blend for mood To awaken and uplift the mood, pop 3 drops of [Peppermint oil](https://www.baseformula.com/peppermint-uk-essential-oil) on a cotton pad and have it next to you so you can inhale the beautiful, invigorating scent of this Top Note oil. Middle note essential oils - Ying Qi level The external Wei level moves into the Ying level, which is associated with the inner organs, blood and emotions. Ying Qi level oils are Middle Notes, and we can see the synchronicity here as these promote movement of Qi because they work a little bit deeper into the body and last a little bit longer in the system. Middle Notes are the body of an aromatherapy blend. Ying Qi supports the immune system, the digestive system and muscles, so, if you are looking to create balance here, we have the following beautiful blends: Ying Qi blend for immunity When your body needs a boost, mix 3 drops Tea Tree and 3 drops [Palmarosa](https://www.baseformula.com/palmarosa-essential-oil) into 15ml Grapeseed oil and apply to your body as a massage blend, allowing the Middle Notes to sink into your skin. Ying Qi blend for digestion When you are suffering with digestive disturbance, create a massage blend of 3 drops [Roman Chamomile](https://www.baseformula.com/chamomile-roman-essential-oil) and 3 drops Ginger in 15ml of [Grapeseed oil](https://www.baseformula.com/grapeseed-carrier-oil) and apply gently, and slowly, in a clockwise direction, to your abdomen Ying Qi blend for muscles If you need to support muscles, mix 3 drops [Sweet Marjoram](https://www.baseformula.com/marjoram-sweet-essential-oil) and 3 drops Lavender into 15ml Grapeseed oil and massage into the affected area to balance Ying Qi. Base note essential oils - Yuan Qi level Yuan Qi level is the deepest level and most mysterious energy, and therefore associated with Base Note oils. Yuan Qi is connected to our Jing, the life energy, the essence of life; source energy. It is the energy associated with our DNA, our potential and creation. And so, given this is the deepest energy, we can see the synchronicity here with Base Notes, which are derived from roots, resins and woods, and some flowers, and are really grounding, earthy, deep-acting oils. These oils are thick in their viscosity, work deeply to our core, and help us descend into our Qi - to direct our energy downwards. This means these oils are excellent for grounding and meditation and the reproductive system. These are also the oils that are often helpful to treat chronic conditions because of their deep level of work - often chronic conditions are due to the potential of our Soul being suppressed. Yuan level oils are associated with Yin energy and so they often treat symptoms that manifest in the evening - e.g. insomnia and night sweats, so applying them at night can be helpful for creating balance. Yuan Qi blend for grounding meditation If your life force energy is feeling suppressed, a meditative Base Note blend would be balancing for you - mix 3 drops [Sandalwood](https://www.baseformula.com/sandalwood-agmark-essential-oil), 3 drops Patchouli and 1 drop Myrrh into water in an electrical [aromatherapy diffuser](https://www.baseformula.com/accessories/essential-oil-burners-diffusers) or candle burner and sit and meditate, grounding into the earth to reconnect. Yuan Qi blend for the reproductive system or night sweats If you are feeling an imbalance in your reproductive system, try this massage blend - mix 3 drops Frankincense, 2 drops [Patchouli](https://www.baseformula.com/patchouli-essential-oil) and 1 drop Vetivert into 15ml Grapeseed oil and apply to your whole body working in the direction towards your heart. Yuan Qi blend for insomnia If you're suffering with insomnia, Base Note oils can be really powerful - pop 3 drops of [Vetivert](https://www.baseformula.com/vetivert-essential-oil) on a cotton pad and place in your pillow case Overall, it is really interesting to see how the fragrance notes of essential oils correspond to these three levels of Qi, so that we can begin to supercharge our use of essential oils, using them more intentionally as the healing medicine Aromatherapy is. Of course, this doesn't mean we need to use only one fragrance note in our blends; armed with this new knowledge, we can use them more intuitively as - ideally - our blends would include one of each fragrance note (Top, Middle, Bottom) and work on these different levels of Qi in one synergistic blend. Now you've got a feeling for this, why not create your own intuitive blends (using the above dilution guidelines), with the new knowledge of what energetic level you are working on? Happy exploring.
