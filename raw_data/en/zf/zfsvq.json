This report is an overview of systematic reviews on the effects of adapted interventions for fami lies with low socioeconomic status, ethnic minority families and teenage mothers, and interventions to promote interaction with the child for mothers with postpartum depression. We included ten systematic reviews of high methodological quality. The findings show that: Counselling, education and information about breastfeeding by health care work- ers adapted for low-income women can prob ably increase the proportion who ini- tiate breastfeeding and breastfeed at 3-6 months. Such interventions can per- haps also increase the proportion who initiate exclusive breastfeeding. Home visiting programs for families with low socioeconomic status can probably reduce the prevalence of childhood injuries. It is uncertain whether it has any ef-fect on uptake of childhood vaccinations. Parent training programs adapted for soci ally disadvantaged families can perhaps prevent some externalizing behaviour of the child. Support or outreach by lay health care workers for families with low socioeco- nomic status do probably not alter the pr oportion who initiate breastfeeding, but can perhaps considerably increase the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding the first 6 months and who breastfeed the firs t year. Such interventions can probably also increase the uptake of childhood vaccina tions, but has probably little effect on child fruit intake Several of the study populations included ethnic minorities, but none of the systematic reviews addressed effects of interventions adapted for the needs of ethnic minorities. There is very limited documentation on whether parent training programs for teenage mothers and interventions for mothers with postnatal depression can improve aspects of mother-child interaction. Many of the studies were conducted in countries where the health services are organised differently from our country. Due to aspects of study design and implemen tation or small studie s, we had generally moderate to low confidence in the documentation. When we have low confidence in the documentation this does not mean that the interventions are ineffective, but that the documentation is limited to infe r on the magnitude of any effects. Title: Effect of adapted interventions for primary child health care services ------------------------------------------ Type of publication: Systematic review A review of a clearly formulated question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant re-search, and to collect and analyse data from the studies that are in- cluded in the review. Statistical methods (meta-analysis) may or may not be used to analyse and summarise the results of the in- cluded studies. ------------------------------------------ Doesn't answer everything: - Excludes studies that fall outside of the inclusion criteria - No health economic evaluation - No recommendations ------------------------------------------ Publisher: Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services ------------------------------------------ Updated: Last search for studies: October 2013. ------------------------------------------ Peer review: Professor Monica Martinussen University of Troms\u00f8 and director Bernadette Kumar, The Norwegian Centre for Minority Health Research (project plan).

Studies show that groups with low socioeconomic status or immigrant groups have more health proble ms and struggle to interact efficiently with the health care services. Pre-school ch ild health services also encounter families that may have various needs for support. Interventions that adapt health promotion and disease prevention efforts to the needs of these families can make the service more equitable. The Norwegian Directorate of Health requested summarized knowledge about the effect of such adapted services. Objective The aim of this report is to write an over view of systematic reviews on the effect of interventions in pre-school (0-6 years) ch ild health care services adapted for fami- lies with low socioeconomic status, ethnic minority families or teenage mothers, and interventions for mothers with postpartum depression that promote mother-child interaction. Method We searched 13 international databases up until October 2013. Two independent persons reviewed the titles and abstracts and judged appropriateness for inclusion based on full text assessment. We included all systematic reviews of high methodo- logical quality that evaluated the effect of interventions adapted for the four defined population groups. Risk of bias assessment s in the results were based on the review authors' judgements. The quality of evidence was considered for each outcome using the GRADE methodology. The documentation was judged to be of either of high quality ( ), moderate quality ( ), low quality ( ), or very low quality ( ). 8 Executive summary (English) Results We included ten systematic reviews of high methodological quality. Four of these specifically address adapted interventions. The remaining answer aspects of our aim through sub-analyses or indi rectly. The results are grouped into six categories of similar interventions, rather than by population group. None of the reviews report possible unwanted effects related to implementation of the intervention. One systematic review (ten studies from the USA and UK) looks at the effect of counselling, education and in formation about breastfeedin g by health care workers adapted for low-income women compared with standard health care. They found an increase in the proportion who initiate br eastfeeding (RR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.21 to 95% CI: 1.34 to 2.21)() and breastfeed at 3-6 months (RR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.30)( ). Two systematic reviews (33 studies from th e USA, Canada, Australia, UK, New Zea- land, Ireland and Turkey) look at the effect of home visiting programs for families with low socioeconomic status compared with standard he alth care. They found re- duced incidence of childhood accident s (RR 0.83, 95% CI: 0.73 to 0.94) ( ), but the uptake of ch ild vaccinations is uncertain ( ). Two systematic reviews (16 studies from th e USA, Canada, Australia and Germany) look at the effect of adapted parent tr aining programs compared with standard health care. Programs adapted for socially disadvantaged families give some reduc- tion in externalizing behaviour in the chil d after 12-16 months: The Incredible Years Program ). It is uncertain whether programs adapted for teenage mothers have an effect on mother- child interaction ( ). One systematic review (seven studies from the US, Canada, Bermuda, Jamaica and Ireland) looks at the effect of home-based child develo pment interventions for fami- lies with low socioeconomic status compared with no intervention. It is uncertain whether the intervention has any effect on the child's cognitive development (). Three systematic reviews (16 studies from th e USA, UK, Brazil, Mexico and Ireland) look at the effect of support and outreach by lay health care workers for families with low socioeconomic status comp ared with standard health care. One finds no change in the proportion who initiate breastfeeding (RR 1.11, 95% CI: 0.93 to 1.31) (), excl usive breastfeeding (RR 4.31, 95% CI : 1.27 to 14.6) ( ) and increase in breastfeeding the first year (RR 1.29, 95% CI: 1.31 to 1.48) ( ). The second finds higher upta ke of childhood vaccination (RR 1.19, 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.30) ( ). The third finds no effect on the children's fruit intake (SMD fruit intake 0.01, 95% CI: -0.09 to 0.11) ( ). 9 Executive summary (English) One systematic review (eight studies from th e USA, UK or Australia) looks at the ef- fect of interventions for mothers with post partum depression to promote interaction with the child. It is uncertain whether such interventions have an effect on mother- child interaction and chil d cognitive development ( ). Discussion Our findings show that relatively few systematic reviews focus on interventions adapted for vulnerable groups of parents with children aged 0-6 years. Due to as- pects of study design and implementation or small studies, we have generally mod- erate to low confidence in the documentation. When we have low confidence in the documentation this does not mean that the interventions are ineffective, but that the documentation is limited to in fer on the magnitude of any effects. Many of the stud- ies were conducted in countries where the health services are organised differently from our country, which is of relevanc e to the transferability of results. Specific issues for each of the six categories of interventions were: In the studies of counselling, education and information about breastfeeding by health care workers, breast feeding initiation rates in the study populations were much lower than in Norway. A majority of the studies offered frequent contact with health care workers around the time of giving birth. Most of the home visiting programs were complex. The majority offered frequent contact with counselling about a broad ra nge of topics, including child health and development, social issues and the parental role, all offered in the home. The study populations for the three comp arisons of parent training programs were very different. The reviews give sparse descriptions of the theoretical con-tent of the programmes and how these were adapted to the target groups. Home-based child development interven tions promoting child cognitive devel- opment intersect the responsibilities of the health care and educational systems, containing a curriculum and age-ap propriate learning resources. In the studies of support or outreach by lay health care workers, these persons either took the role of a guide or an advo cate in relation to capitalize on the op- portunities of the health care system or they gave advice and support. They often came from the same social and cultural groups as the families they contacted. Most were women. The interventions for mothers with postnatal depression can be categorised into two groups: different forms of individual therapies or support groups offering companionship, training in assessing infant behaviour and/or baby massage. 10 Executive summary (English) Conclusion The summarized evidence on the effect of adapted interventions in child health ser- vices for families with children aged 0-6 year s is limited. Four main categories of in- terventions show possible effect on at le ast one outcome: Breastfeeding counselling, education and information by health care workers; home visiting programs; adapted parent training programs; and support or ou treach by lay health care workers. All the interventions were adapted for families with low socioecono mic status. Several of the study populations included ethnic minorities, but none of the reviews ad-dressed effect of interventions adapted for ethnic minorities. There is very limited evidence whether parental training program for teenage mothers and interventions of depressed mothers may affect the mother-child interaction. 11 Innhold Innhold HOVEDFUNN 2 SAMMENDRAG 3 KEY MESSAGES (ENGLISH) 6 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (ENGLISH) 7 INNHOLD 11 FORORD 13 FORM\u00c5L 14 INNLEDNING 15 Bakgrunn Vedlegg 2: Search strategy 78 Vedlegg 3: Methodological quality summary review 103 Vedlegg 4: Description of included systematic reviews 105 Vedlegg 5: List of protocols fo r ongoing systematic reviews 116 Vedlegg 6: Excluded publications 117 Vedlegg 7: GRADE evidence profiles 132 Vedlegg 8: Meta-analyses of targeted lay health worker interventions on 13 og tilbud tiltak som go har ti-\u00e5rene, 891 barn ble f\u00f8dt av m\u00f8dre under 20 \u00e5r i 2013 (38).

Interventions should be targeted to The review considered three main categories of interventions: Universally de-livered programs, selectively given programs and programs given based on in- dication (related to behavioural problems in the child). We only considered the selectively given programs our report. The review authors defined selective prevention programs as interventions given to groups with some common external risk factor. Comparisons From the selective prevention programs sections only 1. Parent training programs compared to no intervention. Four of the eight included studies had study populations with a wider age-range of the children than defined in our inclusion criteria (3-7 years (2 studies) and 2-12 years (2 studies)). Results for the younger children could not be separated from the main analyses. The compari- son is included in our report. 2. Family support programs compared to no intervention. All the included study populations targeted school-aged children. Com-parison excluded. 3. Complex programs com-pared to no intervention. All the included study populations targeted school-aged children. Com-parison excluded. 4. Programs for prevention of anxiety and depression. All the included study populations targeted school-aged children. Com-parison excluded.
