During the hearing, Senator Marshall said in part, \"We had record unemployment through the COVID pandemic...Kansas like many states just did [horrible](https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/marshall-moran-estes-laturner-mann-state-leaders-call-on-governor-to-improve-response-times-to-kansans-filing-for-unemployment/) trying to filter through the unemployment issues...On top of this now, the White House has issued a vaccine mandate...My phone again blowing up from small businesses, from big businesses. They are telling me maybe 30 to 50 percent of their line workers, the blue collar workers are not vaccinated. They don't plan on getting vaccinated. This is a personal choice they have made. This vaccine mandate is a slap in the face of so many people that ran to the battle. The nurses, the doctors, the ambulance drivers, our police officers, they developed natural immunity because there was no vaccine. The natural immunity [is] well proven to be better than vaccines, but the CDC and this White House will not acknowledge natural immunity. So you can see that we are on the path to more record numbers of people becoming unemployed because of Joe Biden's vaccine mandate...You have little if any experience dealing with unemployment... when we see unemployment rates spike again in the next couple months due to this vaccine mandate, what is your plan to help Kansas and other states be able to handle the problem.\" You may click [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiao1zSjWYg) or on the image below to watch the exchange.
