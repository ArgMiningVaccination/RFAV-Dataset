An important aspect of both is the ability of antigen-presenting cells to process and present the tumor peptides that form the basis of the immuno-logical recognition of tumor cells. The tumor antigens are phagocytized and partially digested by the anti-gen-presenting cells; they are presented as peptides bound to MHC type II receptors on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell. Antigen-presenting cells in- clude cells, and B-lymphocytes. The MHC type I surface receptors that form the basis of HLA tissue typing are present in all nucleated cells of the body, including the tumor cells [1 -4]. These receptors pres- ent, in a quasi-random manner, examples of intracel- lular peptides. The MHC type I receptors of the tumor cells also present tumor-specific peptide antigens, al-lowing the immune system to adequately sensitize to react against the tumor [5 ]. For decades, the use of conventional therapies such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy have gov-erned the management of cancer patients [6-9]. Howev - er, there are multiple cases where a total benefit of the patients is not achieved, with new tumor relapses and/Abstract The 21st century has been the period for immunotherapy for cancer, including the use of vaccines, developed for the control of infectious agents, and now showing its usefulness also for internal agents such as cells tumors that are cloned and have accelerated mitosis states. At Cancer Research Laboratory of Manuela Beltran Univer - sity (UMB), research was carried out with the design and development of the CIMT-54 biological vaccine: A combina - tion of oncotropic virus + amino acids as adjuvants, which act directly on the tumor cell, preventing the reproduction of metastases to other organs and preventing the attack on healthy cells of the organism. The results at preclinical level suggested that the CIMT-54 vaccine is not cytotoxic; and on the other hand, in the studies carried out in Wistar rats, it was observed that the vaccine is capable of \"blocking\" the tumor cells, which makes it effective to stop the metastasis, respecting the healthy tissues and organs. A clinical study was carried out with 59 individuals, of which 21 were patients with different stages of cancer, the majority previously treated with conventional therapy. A protocol of 9 doses of the CIMT-54 vaccine was initiated, without any oth-er type of coadjuvant treatment (by decision of the patients), in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy in the different types of cancer, managing to demonstrate the clinical and paraclinical stability of the patients, with a low rate of pro-gression, and also improving the quality of life of the patient.

Therefore, there is a need for the use of immunothera - py mediated by oncotic viruses, where safety has been demonstrated in induction of a directed immune re - sponse, low rate of adverse effects as well as a low risk of autoimmunity associated with the use of the vaccine, and a strong oncoreactivity for stop tumor progression, and in some cases complete remission [40-45]. Several types of viruses have been evaluated, with variable re - sults in their outcomes; particularly in the UMB, a study of several types was initiated until obtaining the best response with an oncotropic virus of canine origin, to-gether with adjuvant amino acids, the immune complex CIMT-54 (previous in vitro tests) was achieved 1778/8. Materials and methods We recruited 59 individuals for the total study: 21 patients with different types of cancer and in different stages (I-IV) received the immune complex, in order to evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of the CIMT-54 vaccine, comparing its behavior with 24 patients with cancer who did not receive the immune complex (and contin - ued their usual conventional management), as well as two control groups: 4 healthy controls immunized with the immune complex, and 10 healthy controls not im- munized, between 2007 and 2008. After acceptance by the Ethics Committee of Manu - ela Beltran University (UMB), held on February 22, 2007 (document 22022007), approving the participation of patients in compassionate experimental study after checking the results obtained in preclinical studies, pa- tients were recruited to through television information on regional channels in the country, such as City TV, RCN and radio media such as W radio. It was explained to the media what the vaccine consisted of and the preclinical results that had been obtained. A 2-hour conference was held in the UMB audito - rium on how they could participate in the study, they have explained what the vaccine consisted of and the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the participants were evaluated (see Table 1 ). The recruited patients signed informed consent to enter the study voluntarily. Once all the requirements were fulfilled and they were accepted in the study, a clinical history of admission was made with the labora - tory examinations prior to the study. They have initially given three doses of 0.3 mL of a vaccine, subcutane - ously weekly and then monthly reinforcements for 12 months. Each patient was evaluated individually at 3 months from the start of treatment and then at 6, 9 and 12 months of the study with paraclinical studies (complete blood count, tumor antigens, liver tests [Transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin], [IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and IL- TNF-] with BioLegend reagent kit [ELISA or adverse effects attributable to said management [10]. Alternative treatments have been considered, which al-low the effective elimination of tumor cells, minimizing adverse effects, as well as tumor relapse, within which immunotherapy has emerged, as an attractive strategy. Immunotherapy includes techniques that enhance the natural immune response to tumors, through vaccines or biological response modifiers, mainly immunomodu - latory cytokines [11-14]. Cancer therapeutic vaccines are based on the ma- nipulation of the immune system in order to comple- ment traditional oncological treatments such as che- motherapy, radiotherapy and radical surgery or they can act on their own causing the specific immune re - sponse on tumor cells, developing the ability to fight against the advancement of cancer cells [15, 16]. At present both preventive and therapeutic vaccines have been developed [8 ], and are in the stage of clini- cal experimentation, different types of vaccines from interferons (IFN alpha, beta and gamma), interleuk - ins (IL-2), colony stimulants factors (CEF) and mono-clonal antibodies (MAb) in various types of tumors [6,17-25] . Vaccines are today a new therapeutic alternative to counteract not only cancer but most of the chron - ic infectious diseases that affect the world population [26-28]. Currently, there are more than 300 vaccine studies for different types of cancer. Experimentally, in the 1960s, Wheelock and Dingle [29] (NEJM, 1964), considering acute leukemia as an entity of viral origin, carried out a protocol for the administration of viruses such as Sendai, Newcastle and strains of Influenzae A and B with in order to achieve viral interference, denot - ing the decrease in production of myeloblasts, as well as hepatosplenic size reduction, but with very transient effect and non-sustained remission. A series of vaccines are being developed, some still in preclinical experimen-tation, while others are already being tested in clinical studies (Phases I, II, III and IV) [28], as in Argentina, where a vaccine called Vaccimel has been developed, for stages III and IV of melanoma with promising results, it is already being applied to a group of more than 100 patients in advanced stages [ 30]. There is also another type of immunotherapy, called passive [31, 32], which consists of the use of the so- called Monoclonal antibodies, designed to bind specif - ic targets called checkpoints, such as CTLA4, PD1 and PDL1, which are specific proteins and whose antibod - ies are anti CTLA4, anti PD1 and anti PDL1, which will cause these antibodies to bind to said proteins to block them through the T lymphocytes and the CMH of the dendritic cell, which is the antigen presenting cell-CPA [33-36]. However, this type of therapy has shown the presence of side effects, especially at the rheumato-logical and immunological level, but also in other sys- tems, such as digestive, neurological, cardiopulmonary Interferon) were the ISSN: 2643-4563DOI: 10.23937/2643-4563/1710018 Page 3 of 8 Segura-Puello et al.

Patients evaluated during and after treat - ment with the vaccine showed that it was safe, given the absence of side effects attributable to the use of the immune complex, and was effective in clinical and par-aclinical stability (see Figure 1 and Figure 2), regardless of the tumor type and of the presented stadium. There was even a great response in terms of partial remission (improvement) and no changes (stability) in patients in plete remission) according to WHO and RECIST criteria for response in solid and hematological tumors [46, 47] (see Table 2). Follow-up of tumor markers in response was also performed [48, 49], and interleukin monitoring throughout the entire process to determine the antitu - mor effect associated with the vaccine.

Int J Oncol Res 2019, 2:018sufficient tests were performed that allowed the ad- justment of the dose/response. The administration of 9 doses of the CIMT-54 vac - cine at the established dose, without other coadjuvant treatment, allows us to infer that the treatment with the CIMT-54 vaccine was successful, both in prolonging and improving the quality of life of the patient, with - out receiving no complementary treatment, as well as maintaining clinical and paraclinical stability indexes, which would make it possible for the CIMT-54 vaccine to be an effective and economical alternative in the treatment of cancer, especially in those cases of ear - ly detection, finding an scientific option for patients in terminal stages [50, 51]. We believe that therapy with the CIMT-54 vaccine is promising to prevent and treat cancer. The limitations in our study are focused on the few immunological tests that were carried out, given technical and logistical difficulties with higher technol - ogy equipment, which would give a much broader rich-ness to the beneficial effects of the vaccine, as well as allow us under a more detailed analysis, the possibility of evaluating which type of tumors can have a greater response based on the oncotrophic mechanism of the virus, and by which routes. Conclusion There are several questions:Discussion Previous studies performed in vitro tests with tumor cells show morphological evidence of cell adhesion and interruption adhesion mole- cules (cadherins, adhesin, connexins) when the vaccine was applied in 3 doses, not allowing these cells they continued dividing by mitosis, thus avoiding the tumor progression towards metastasis. 84% of the patients in our study had received some type of conventional treatment (Chemotherapy, Radio - therapy and/or surgery), while 16% on admission had not received any treatment, regardless of the stage in which they were. The established dose/response of the vaccine was 0.3 mL. This was applied to the group of patients, with no noticeable side effects or anaphylactic reactions. The CIMT-54 vaccine was applied in three initial dos-es, with an interval of 1 week between each and with monthly reinforcements, in a period of 12 months, observing a promising response that allowed to proj- ect the efficacy of the CIMT-54 vaccine and justify the clinical trial that we call a case study, because, with the results in preclinical phase that was also very promising, it was concluded that the CIMT-54 vaccine was not cytotoxic in the in vitro studies, nor toxic in the experimental animals at the dose 0.3 mL, after 050100150200250300 controls Follow-up. A comparison between IL-s between patients immunized and non-immunized, demonstrate that CIMT-54 reduce the expression of IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, as a markers of inflammatory tumoral activity, with stability of IL-10, IL-15 as promoters of antitumor cytotoxicity.ISSN: 2643-4563DOI: 10.23937/2643-4563/1710018 Page 7 of 8 Segura-Puello et al.

Having shown in this case that vaccines have fewer side effects for cancer patients, could they be more effective than monoclonal antibodies? 3. The problem with vaccines for cancers takes much longer to produce a response and be effective than chemotherapy itself. Could this be a limitation for its use? 4. Could the side effects of monoclonal antibodies be improved to make them more effective? 5. Would vaccines reduce treatment costs and allow a greater field of action, unlike monoclonal antibod - ies, taking into account the direct costs, accessibility, and barriers of the health system?
