The workshop was structured in two panels, the first part dedicated to the presentation of alternative therapies and meth ods, and a second part focusing on the harmonisation measures in that area. Aim The workshop was organised with the aim of raising awareness about alternative medicines and exchanging views on th e current legal framework. In opening the workshop, Mr PETERLE pointed out that many European citizens use alternative medicines. He underlined, however, that the regulatory status of Alternative Medicine practices and products varies across Member St ates. He expressed his hope that the workshop 'could lead to the normalisatio n of the status of Alternative Medicines and also to [their] demystification'. Mr PETERLE also said that Alternative Medicines can be effective, for example, in the prevention of disease, as well as being cost-effective. The workshop panel consisted of seven practitioners in the field of al ternative therapies and medicines, and each provided a short presenta tion on their particular area of practice, Dr. Yu HAN, the General Secret ary of the UK Association of Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCM) gave an overview of TCM and said that 'TCM is a safe therapy when carried out by a well-qualified practitioner'. Dr. Harsha GRAMMINGER, the President of the European Ayurveda Association, provided insight into the most commonly used ayurvedic therapies and explained their health benefits. She emphasized that 'Ayurveda could have huge financial and social benefits for the Member States' health care systems'. Dr. Ton NICOLAI, President of the European Committee for Homeopathy, highlighted the increasing number of EU citizens using this therapy. Dr NICOLAI also said that the current EU and national legal framew ork for alternative practices and medicinal products is unsatisfactory. Dr. Andreas BUCHINGER of the Dr. Otto Buchinge r Clinic described the health benefits of remedial fasting. He ex plained that fasting is a powerful tool to help patients with chronic diseases and emphasized that fasting is a cost-effective and sustainable way to treat patients. Dr. Natasha CAMPBELL-MCBRIDE, a physician and nutri-therapist, described nutritional therapy as a powerful therapy fo r treating brain dysfunctions. 5 Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy ____________________________________________________________________________________________ Dr. Aleksandar MITOV, a health specialist from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, emphasized the need for a 'par adigm shift' in Europe, moving away from reactive health care towards preventive approaches. He said th at reactive health care is not sustainable, given its costs and Europe's ageing population. He explained th at alternative therapies (e.g. Thermo-regulation therapy) which are cost-effe ctive, enhance the natural resilience of patients to diseases, and have measurable resu lts, are effective tools in the prevention of disease. Dr. Elio ROSSI, representing the Tuscany Region Network for Integrative Medicine, described current research on the role of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) in cancer treatment. Despite the benefits of such therapies, Dr. ROSSI emphasized that 'CAM therapies should never be used as a repl acement of conventional cancer care', and he called for further research on this topic. During the second part of the workshop, Dr. Andrzej RYS, the Director of the Health Systems and Products Directorate of DG SAN CO, confirmed that the number of European patients using alternative medicines is increasing. Dr. RYS gave an overview of the current EU legal framework affecting alternative me dicine practices and medicinal products. Although many speakers of the workshop re ferred to the shortcomings of the Herbal Medicines Directive (Directive 2004/27/EC), Dr. RYS said 'it is too early to say how the Directive is working', as it has only recently become fully operational, and a revision is not being considered at this stage. He said that the European Commission will continue to follow the field of alternative medicines and to support research in this area. In his closing remarks, Mr PETERLE stressed that the European Parliament will continue to pay attention to CAM products and therapies. Mr PETERLE also said that the European Parliament would prepare an own initiative report to raise awareness about alternative medicines in the EU. 6 Workshop on 'Alternative Medicines'/Workshop Proceedings ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 1. LEGAL AND POLICY BACKGROUND An increasing number of Europe an citizens use alternative me dicines. According to a joint report of main European and international complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) associations,1 about 65% of Europe's population ha s already used CAM. The Report states that 'Approximately 30-50% of the European population uses CAM as self-support and 10- 20% of the European population has seen CAM physician/practitioners within the previous year [2009]'. The number of CAM-trained practi tioners is also growing in the EU, with an estimated figure of around 180,000 doctors. The growing use of CAM among European citizens and practitioners constitutes a regulatory challenge for the European Unio n. Among the key challenges are the different regulatory status of CAM practices and products in the Memb er States as well as the fact that some of the health related topics fall within the ex clusive competence of the Member States. As an example of the different regulatory status of CAM, it is worth mentioning that in some countries alternative therapies are pr ovided outside conventional health care institutions, whereas in others they are prov ided as part of conventional health care services. Another element is th at in some Member States, CAM can only be provided by medical practitioners, whereas in others, non-medical practitioners may also provide certain alternative therapies. Moreover, there is no mutual recognition of CAM diplomas among the Member States, which hinders the free movement of CAM practitioners. In order to overcome these differences, the European Union has already carried out the first steps towards EU-wide harmonisation. The first legal instrument regulating CAM products was adopted in 1992 (Directive 92/73/EEC), 2 which was repealed in 2001 by the so-called \"[Homeopathic] Medicinal Products Directive\".3 This Directive together with the Herbal Medicine Directive,4 aim to provide patients with a sufficient level of information so as to ensure the safety and good quality of traditional medicinal products on the market. To this end, the Directives have introduced special authorisation and regi stration procedures for CAM products. Some practitioners argue that the legal fram ework for herbal medicinal products is not adequately tailored to the characteristics of these products. As Dr. RYS noted in his presentation, the Herbal Medicine Directive has only recently become fully operational after a seven year transitional pe riod given for its implemen tation. Thus, the European Commission is not considering the revision of the Directive at this stage. 1http://www.homeopathyeurope.org. 2 Council Directive 92/73/EEC of 22 September 1992 widening the scope of Directives 65/65/EEC and 75/319/EEC on the approximation of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action relating to medicinal products and laying down additional provisions on ho meopathic medicinal products, OJ L 297, 13.10.1992, p. 8- 11. 3 Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use, OJ L 311, 28.11.2001, p. 67-128. 4 Directive 2004/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 amending, as regards traditional herbal medicinal products, Directive 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use, OJ L 136, 30.4.2004, p. 85-90. 7 Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy ____________________________________________________________________________________________ The Professional Qual ifications Directive1 which regulates the cross-border recognition of many professions in Europe, was adopted in 2005. This Directive, however, does not foresee the automatic recognition of CAM qualifications. The Directive is under revision and is currently subject to inter-service consultation. In 2011, the European Union also adopted th e so-called Cross-border Health Directive, 2 which focuses on the safe and good quality of treatments across borders. The Directive provides that patients are allowed to receive health care in another Member State and be reimbursed up to the level of costs that woul d have been assumed by the Member State of affiliation, if this health care had been prov ided in their own Member State. Moreover, the Directive also ensures that pa tients receive a sufficient level of information about cross- border health services. In the context of CAM products, the Re gulation on Nutrition and Food Claims3 is also noteworthy. This Regulation is important, particularly as the distinction between food supplements and herbal medici nes is not always clear. As the report of the European Informatio n Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine suggests,4 sufficient levels of scientific data on the possible risk s and benefits of CAM could facilitate the development of a suitable regulation for CAM products and practices. To this end, the EU has provid ed funding opportunities to CAM research programmes. As an example, the CAMbrell a project could be mentioned, which was established under the Seventh Framework Prog ramme (FP7) in January 2010, with the aim of 'developing a roadmap for future CAM resear ch that is appropriate for the health care needs of European citizens and acceptable to the European Parliament as well as national research funders and health care providers.' 5 Complementary and alternative th erapies with their holistic and integrative approaches are considered to be effective methods of prev ention. One of the core objectives of the European Union's Health Strategy is to focus more on prevention. 6 According to the EU Health Strategy 'health care spending should be accompanied by inve stment in prevention, protecting and improving the population's overall psychical and mental health which, according to OECD data currently amounts to an average of 3% of the Member States' total budget for health compared to 97% spent on health care and treatment'. The necessity of a paradigm shift towards preven tive healthcare in Eu rope is reflected in many journals7 and policy documents of the European Union.8 This paradigm shift is necessary in order to overcome a number of di fficulties faced by Europe's health care. This idea is also reflected in the EU Healthcare Strategy which acknowledges that 'EU health systems are under mounting pressure [...] ' and that there is a need to 'shift from hospital care to preven tion and primary care.'1 1 Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on the recognition of professional qualifications, OJ L 255, 30.9.2005, p. 22-142. 2 Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2011 on the application of patients' rights in cross-border health care, OJ L 88, 4.4.2011, p. 45-65. 3 Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on nutrition and health claims made on foods. 4 Source: http://www. eiccam.eu/pdfs/eiccamb rochurecomplete.pdf. 5 Source: www.cambrella.eu/home.php. 6 Together EU 2008-2013.

This constitutes a two-fold problem fo r Europe's health care , namely the changing disease patterns (i.e. chronic diseases) and incr easing costs for reacti ve health care. These challenges can be addressed inter alia by the promotion of preventive methods and therapies. Professional CAM associations, such as the European Federation for Complementary and Alternative Medicine,2 argue that CAM methods may prov ide cost-effective solutions to these problems as they may cure patients with chronic diseases, contribute to the prevention of diseases and thus provide solu tions for some of the health problems of Europe's ageing population. The potential health and financial benefits of CAM methods have also been recognised by the European Parliament. In its 1997 resolution,3 the European Parliament acknowledged the preventive role of non-co nventional medicines, and calle d on the European Commission to assess the safety and effect iveness of such medicines. In 2010, the CAM Interest Group was founded, which is an informal group of members of the European Parliament with a special interest in Complementary and Alternative Medicine. This Interest Group aims to put and keep CAM on the EU policy agenda, generate discussions and actions in that area, as well as to promote awareness about CAM and other holistic approaches. This workshop organised by the Committee on En vironment, Public Health and Food Safety on 'Alternative Medicine' also served to high light the increasing interest in complementary and alternative medicines in the EU. As Mr PETERLE mentioned in his concluding rema rks, the European Parliament will continue to follow the policy and legal developments in this area. He also said that the least the European Parliament can do is to prepare an own-initiative report on the CAM situation in Europe in order to show the European Comm ission where the gaps are and what could possibly be done. 1 Together for Health: A strategic approach for and Scientific Policy ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 2. PROCEEDINGS OF THE WORKSHOP 2.1. PART 1: DISTINGUISHED EXPERTS 2.1.1. Welcome and opening - MEP Alojz PETERLE substitute on the Committee on the Envi ronment, Public Health and Food Safety, Co-chair of the Working Group on Health of the ENVI Committee In opening the workshop, Mr PETERLE pointe d out that many European citizens use alternative medicines and thus this topic is close to them. He underlined, however, that the regulatory status of Alternative Medicine practices and products varies across Member States. In many Member States alternative medicines do not have the same regulatory status as conventional medicines. This means that altern ative therapies are often provided outside the institutions where conventional health care is provided. In other Member States, such as in Slovenia, medical practitioners are even forb idden to provide alternative therapies. He expressed his hope that the workshop 'could lead to the normalisation of the status of Alternative Medicines and also to [their] demystification'. Mr PETERLE also said that the recognition and provision of alternative and complementary practices and medicines could also lead to the pluralisation of treatments. 2.1.2. Dr. Yu HAN, Traditional Chinese Medicine s Prac titioner, General Secretary of the UK Association of Traditional Chinese Medicines Dr. Yu HAN explained that 'Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a traditional Chinese medical system with a holistic approach to the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of diseases by identifying disease patterns and using individual or combined traditional therapies, such as acupuncture or Chinese herbal medicine.' Over one third of the world's population uses TCM as a health care service to preserve the well-being of their body and mind as well as to prevent and cure disease. TCM is based on a tradition which is more than 3000 years old. Dr. HAN described the views behind TCM, such as the yin-yang universal opposites, which influences the understanding that a body is healthy if the two elements (yin-yang) are in balance; and the understanding that all phenom ena of living world manifest through five elements-qualities - represented by wood, fire, earth, metal and water. These basic materials are used by practitioners to explain the physiology and the pathology of the disease. Dr. HAN explained that TCM focuses on the functions of th e body rather than its anatomical structure, aiming at restoring equilibrium. Dr. HAN also provided an insight into the major therapies of TCM, which are acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, tui na massage, cuppin g therapy, dietary therapy and qi gong. She emphasized that 'TCM is a safe therapy when ca rried out by a well-qualified practitioner'. Finally, Dr. HAN gave an overview of the TCM de velopments in China. She said that in China, TCM and western medicine are eq ually important. In 2006, over 90% of the Chinese clinics had TCM departments and more than 524,000 li censed physicians were also trained TCM doctors. She said that TCM is also popular in Europe, and in the UK alone there are over 2500 TCM practitioners and 4000 acupuncturists. Dr. Han's presentation on 'Traditional Chin ese Medicines' can be found in Annex II. 10 Workshop on 'Alternative Medicines'/Workshop President of the European Ayurveda Association Dr. GRAMMINGER explained that Ayurveda is a 5000 year old medical tradition, which originated in India. Ayurveda is a preventive and curative medicine, which is used by over a quarter of the world's population. This herbal and holistic medicine has eight branches, which include inter alia inner medicine, psychology and reproductive health and toxicology. She described that Ayurveda operates with the bala ncing of three elemental energies: vata (air and space), pitta (fire and water) and kapha (water and earth). According to ayurvedic medical theory, if these three elements exist in equal quantities, the body will be healthy. Dr. GRAMMINGER introduced the main ayurvedi c therapies, which are diet and lifestyle advice, medicines, oil massage, heat treatm ents, detoxification therapy, yoga and meditation. Dr. GRAMMINGER emphasized th at 'Ayurveda works on a scientifically measurable physiological and psychological level, thus is not a 'quackery''. She also said that Ayurveda is not a 'one hat fits all' system, but always provides the basis for an individualised treatment to patients. Dr. GRAMMINGER highlighted the health benefits of Ayurveda as a powerful treatment to cure chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hype rcholesterolemia or rheumatic diseases. She also emphasized that 'Ayurveda would have huge financial and social benefits for the Member States' health care systems', since patients of ayurvedic treatments can avoid long term drug dependencies and complex medical interventions. As a result, the costs of treatments could be significantly cut. She also mentioned the benefits of Ayurveda for the EU's ageing population, which is relevant to the EU's priority of ensuring the healthy and active ageing of all citizens. Dr. GRAMMINGER expressed her hopes for further EU funding in order to research and better demonstrate the health benefits and effectiveness of Ayurveda. She also expressed concern about the fact that in most Member States he alth insurance systems do not cover alternative therapies and medicines. Moreover, she emphasized the need for information centres, where patients can get more information about alternative medicine. Dr. GRAMMINGER also referred to the increasing interest of EU citizens in maintaining their mental and physical health. To this end, she recommended increased integration of information on healthy lifestyle and health education as well as investing more in the training and education of doctors involved in ayurvedic medicine. Dr. GRAMMINGER also said that 'Alternative medicines should be integrated into th e conventional heal th care system'. Dr. GRAMMINGER's presentation on 'Ayurvedic Medicine' can be found in Annex II. 2.1.4. Dr. Ton NICOLAI, Homeopathy Practition er, President of the E u ropean Committee for Homeopathy Dr. NICOLAI emphasized the growing demand for homeopathy from both doctors and patients. He said that 'three out of four EU citizens know about homeopathy, of these 29% use it for their health care'. These figures su ggest that over 100 million EU citizens use homeopathy regularly. Dr. NICOLAI described homeopathy as a long-standing European therapeutic tradition, which is considered as a gentle, safe and effective therapy. Homeopathy is based on the similarity principle, which implies that substances capabl e of causing disorder in healthy subjects are used as medicines to treat similar patterns of disorder experienced by ill people. 11 Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy ____________________________________________________________________________________________ Other principles of homeopathy include the individualization of treatment for patients and the use of minimum doses. Dr. NICOLAI explained the main reasons why do ctors and patients turn towards homeopathy. For example, many citizens use homeopathy to 'avoid long-term or even life-long dependency on conventional prescribed drugs' and doctors tend to use homeopathy because they find it highly effective. Dr. NICOLAI noted that there are over 50,000 trained homeopathy doctors in Europe and many hospitals for example in the United Kingdom or Germany pr oviding homeopathic treatment in their out-patient care. Universities often offer courses on homeopathy in their medical undergraduate and postgraduate educational programmes. He also said that compared to conventional therapies, homeopathy offers a 'safe and cost-effective treatment'. Dr. NICOLAI explained that the regulatory status of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) and practices varies acro ss the EU. One problem is that medical practitioners in some Member States are not allowed to provide CAM therapies. He also noted that there is no mutual recognition of CAM qualifications between the EU Member States, which impedes the free movement of CAM practitioners. He expr essed his wish to extend the scope of Directive 2005/36/EC 1 on the recognition of professional qualifications to CAM practitioners. With regard to homeopathi c medicines, Dr. NICOLAI referred to the Commission Communication from 2008 2 which stated that 'Directive 2004/24/EC3 is not appropriate for a global regulation of such medical practice s [anthroposophic, ayurvedic and TCM]'. He expressed his hope for a separa te legal framework for products of certain traditions and addressed the European Parliament to initiate the adoption of a new legal instrument. Finally, Dr. NICOLAI mentioned the existence of EUROCAM, which is a multi-stakeholder group of physicians, practitioners and patients in the field of CAM. He said that EUROCAM works closely with the European Parliament's CAM Interest Grou p and is engaged in on-going dialogues with the European Commission. Moreover, with the support of DG SANCO, EUROCAM is organising a full-day conferen ce on CAM for Public Health in 2012. Dr. NICOLAI's presentation on 'Homeo pathy' can be found in Annex II. 2.1.5. Dr. Andreas BUCHINGER, Medical Practiti oner and Director of the Dr. Otto Buchinger Clinic Dr. BUCHINGER described remedial fasting as 'the conscious vo luntary renunciation of solid food for a limited period of time.' He emphasized that fasting is not a 'zero-calorie diet', but a low-calorie drinking diet, which protects the vital structures of the body. Dr. BUCHINGER explained that fasting is not only a preventive and/or curative therapy, but it also provides the patients with ideas about a healthy lifestyle and introduces them to the 'world' of healthy food. 1 Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on the recognition of professional qualifications, OJ L 255, 30.9.2005, p. 22-142. 2 European Commission Communication COM(2008)584 on experience acquired as a result of the application of Directive 2004/24/EC's provisions. 3 Directive 2004/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 amending, as regards traditional herbal medicinal products, Directive 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use, OJ L 136, 30.4.2004, p. 85-90. 12 Workshop on 'Alternative Medicines'/Workshop Proceedings ____________________________________________________________________________________________ He explained that there are various kinds of fast ing, such as therapeutic fasting (i.e. fasting therapy or remedial fasting) and preventive fasting. Both may have health benefits for patients with chronic and epidemic diseases, su ch as allergy, type-2 diabetes, high blood pressure, cardio-vascular disorders, arthritis and chronic inflammatory bowel disease. In Germany, fasting can be provided as an in-patie nt care in specialised clinics or as an out- patient therapy, in which case the medically managed fasting is prescribed by practicing physicians. Fasting also exists for healthy people, who need to provide proof from their doctors about their healthy conditions. However, Dr. BUCHINGER emphasized that fasting is not recommended for those wh o suffer from advanced liver and renal failure, eating disorders, or are pregnant. Dr. BUCHINGER explained that at the beginning of each fasting, it is obligatory to check the patient's health, requiring several tests, e.g. a blood test, blood-pressure and electrocardiogram tests and sleep-apnea screen ing. Each fasting therapy starts with a transitional period, when patients eat only vegetables and fruit meals. During these first few days, patients are withdrawn from stimulan ts such as coffee or cigarettes and are encouraged to rest and relax. The main phase of remedial fasting is liquid-based therapy, during which patients take only fluids. In order to prevent disc omfort, patients are given sodi um sulphate or other salts. During the 'post-fasting days', patients are re -introduced to solid food components and are taught about healthy eating habits. Dr. BUCHINGER said that the positive results of fasting are tremendous, e.g. decreasing lipid levels, blood sugar levels, live r enzymes and blood pressure. Dr. BUCHINGER emphasized that remedial fastin g provides a sustainable and cost-effective solution for patients. Moreover, he mentioned that due to its acknowledged health benefits, fasting is subject to more and more world-wi de research programmes and studies. Recent research has involved looking into the benefi ts of fasting in the treatment of cancer. Dr. BUCHINGER's presentation on 'Remedial Fasting' can be found in Annex II. 2.1.6. First round of Questions and Answers After the f i rst part of the workshop, Mr PETERL E opened the floor for questions and said that he was pleased to hear about the scientifically proven benefits of complementary and holistic approaches, noting that the re sults of such therapies are measurable. Mr PETERLE was also delighted to hear presentati ons emphasizing the benefits of preventive methods and presentations about the financial and legal aspects of the use and practice of such methods. Moreover, Mr PETERLE said that these aspect s are in line with the EU 2020 objectives.1 No questions were asked after the first part of the workshop. 1 Promoting good health is important objective of the Europe 2020 Strategy, and is referred to under the objectives of smart and inclusive growth.

Dr. Natasha CAMPBELL-MCBRIDE, Physician-Neurologist and Nutri-therapist In her op en ing, Dr. CAMPBELL-MCBRIDE said that from her perspective 'nutritional therapy is the most powerful way of Alternative Medicines'. Nutri-therapy is based on the idea that there is a connection between the functions of the digestive system, the general health status of the person, and the brain. Dr. CAMPBELL-MCBRIDE said that Hypocrates or iginally acknowledged that 'All diseases begin in the gut'. This statement has been conf irmed by many physicians and scientists over the centuries, such as by Philippe Pinel in 1807. Modern clinical experience proves how correct these theories were and that there is a connection between the state of gut and the health of the brain. Dr. CAMPBELL-MCBRIDE explained that '90% of the cells in human body are gut flora (microbes)'. This number indicates that our health depends hugely on the health and status of this mixture of bacteria. A healthy gut flora with its healthy microbes ensures that food is properly digested and absorbed. She said that if the gut flora is not healthy (e.g. too much pathogenic and disease causing microbes, pa thogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses and parasites), patients can suffer from brain disorders and other chronic diseases, such as cancer. She explained that 'people with an unhealthy gut develop multiple nutritional diseases and their gut instead of being nourished becomes a major source of toxicity.' The pathogenic microbes convert the food into toxins whic h, through the bloodstream, are distributed throughout the body. If these toxins reach th e brain, they block the brain and it cannot function properly anymore, causing mental and physical problems. Many children and adults suffer from brain dysfunctions as a result, e.g. autism, dyslexia, dyspraxia, learning and behavioural problems and epilepsy for kids, and depression, eating disorders, maniac- depression, schizophrenia etc. In case of adults, these diseases often go hand-in-hand with substance abuse, alcohol and tobacco abuse and other addictive behaviours. Dr. CAMPBELL-MCBRIDE indicated the number of children suffering fr om autism. She said that 20 years ago there was only one child ou t of 10 000 thousand diagnosed with autism, whereas 'today in the western world we are di agnosing one child out of 100.' This is a one hundred-fold increase of newly diagnosed children with autism. She stressed that over 99% of these children are born with a perfectly norm al brain, but in the first year they develop abnormal gut flora, which poisons their brains. Dr. CAMPBELL-MCBRIDE said that unfortunately, many physicians waste valuable ti me while trying to diagnose these children, 60-70% of whom do not fit into one single \"diagnosis box\". Dr. CAMPBELL-MCBRIDE stressed that the longer physicians let patients suffer from the diseases the more difficult it is to treat them. Nutri-therapy focuses on the health of gut and applies diet as a treatment. Dr. CAMPBELL-MCBRIDE explained that this diet needs to be a specific diet, which heals and seals the gut. Other elements of the nutri-therapy are well- chosen nutritional supplements, the use of na tural detoxification methods and life-style change. As a result of a nutri-therapy, the gut becomes a source of nourishment instead of a source of toxicity. In her closing remarks, Dr CAMPBELL-MCBR IDE presented her book called 'Gut and Psychology Syndrome' (2004), which aims to give a better understanding to the reader about the development of the syndrome and about how it can be treated effe ctively with a sound nutritional protocol. 14 Workshop on 'Alternative Medicines'/Workshop Proceedings ____________________________________________________________________________________________ Dr. CAMPBELL-MCBRIDE's presentation on 'Nutri-therapy for brain problems' can be found in Annex II. 2.1.8. Dr. Aleksandar MITOV, Health Specialist and Medical Doctor In the first part of his presentation, Dr. MITOV talked about medicine in general and explained the current paradigm within conven tional medicine. The second part of his presentation focused on the method of thermoregulation as a therapy of 'active prevention'. Dr. MITOV, first presented a graph prepared by the British Medical Journal of Clinical Evidence, which illustrates the effectiveness of conventional treatments. He said that out of 3000 treatments, only 11% are considered to be beneficial, whereas 51% of treatments have unknown effects. In this context he argued that conventional medicine needs a paradigm shift from reactive health care towards pr eventive approaches. He said that 'reactive medicine is a burden for society, whereas preventive medicine could relieve it'. Dr. MITOV also stressed that while reactive medicines are costly, preventive ones are economically feasible. To support this, he noted that the to tal expenditure dedicated to prevention in the EU (including vaccines) is 2.8%, while 75% go es to the treatment of chronic diseases. Dr. MITOV highlighted two tendencies in Euro pe, namely the ageing population and the increasing rate of chronic diseases. He also po inted out the link between these two factors by saying that chronic diseases are more common among elderly. He explained that given these tendencies, conventional medicine is not a sustainable solution and stressed the well-known advantages of preventive solu tions for chronic diseases. Dr. MITOV concluded the first part of the presen tation by stating that 'We need to focus on preventive medicine'. In the second part of his presentation, Dr. MITO V proposed four pivotal criteria in order to focus on prevention: scientific sustainability, e nhancing the natural res ilience of patients to diseases, measurability of resu lts and cost-effectiveness. As an example of active prevention therapie s, Dr. MITOV introduced the thermoregulation method, which is based on three pillars, namely on plant based nutrition, natural oils and non-invasive blood analysis. While explaining their unquestionable health benefits, Dr. MITOV argu ed that plant-based products are scientifically sustainable. Among others, he said that the advantages of plant- based nutrition to diseases have been highli ghted by the CHINA study which 'produced 8000 statistically significant associat ions'. In the context of plant based nutrition, Dr. MITOV also referred to evidence including a study by Newcastle University which indicated that type 2 diabetes was reversible by fasting. Dr. MITOV also highlighted the health benefits of natural cold pressed oils, which are easily absorbed by the human body and help it to gr adually balance and heal itself. In order to illustrate that cold pressed oils enhance th e resilience of patients, Dr. MITOV gave the example of Oil 57 (grape seed oil) which can inhibit human breast carcinoma, lung cancer and gastric cancer, and moreover can have anti -inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-viral and other beneficial effects on human disease cond itions. He also emphasized that the health benefits of natural cold pressed oils have been scientifically proven. 15 Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy ____________________________________________________________________________________________ As regards measurability of results, Dr. MITOV noted that the AMP non-invasive blood analyser is an innovative piece of technology th at applies sensors to five biologically active points on the human body su rface and measures temperature, thereby determining the indicators of a comprehensive blood analysis which are used for diagnostics of diseases in medical practice. This analyser is able to provide 117 parameters within three minutes. In his concluding remarks Dr. MITOV emphasized that preventive methods are the most cost- effective means of addressing the problems faced by Europe's health care system. Dr. MITOV's presentation on 'Reducing health care costs by increasing human natural resilience with ThermoRegulation Method' can be found in Annex II. 2.1.9. Dr Elio ROSSI, Medical Doctor/Director of a Homeopathy Clinic Dr. ROS S I's presentation focused on the use of CAM in cancer treatment, which is also known among practitioners as \"Integrative oncology\". In his introduction, Dr . ROSSI mentioned that in Europe up to 35% of adults and 30-32% of child cancer patients use CAM. Dr. ROSSI described that CAM therapies are often used in addition to conventional treatments. These CAM therapies include the use of herbal medicines and supplements, Traditional Chinese Medicine, homeopathy, relaxation and spiritual therapies and the use of vitamins/minerals. The main stimuli for using alternative medicine, according to Dr. ROSSI were to maintain hope and the wish of patients to take an active role in their self-care. Dr. ROSSI emphasized that patients deciding to use CAM should always be informed about the potential risks and benefits of such therapies and medicines. Dr. ROSSI highlighted the potential negative consequences of using CAM therapies exclusively, by stating that 'alternative therap ies used as primary treatment for breast cancer can be associated with increased recurrence and death. Homeopathy, if used instead of surgery, results in disease progression in most patients'. In addition, Dr. ROSSI referred to the possible side effects of herbal medicines used by cancer patients and the fact that these medicines may interact with cancer drugs. By way of examples, Dr. ROSSI cited studies indicating that green tea may reduce the effica cy of bortezomib used for the treatment of myeloma, while hypericum reduces the efficacy of irinotecan used in the treatment of colon or rectal cancer. Dr. ROSSI noted that numerous research programmes and studie s have been carried out in order to improve the limited information about the safety and effectiveness of CAM therapies in cancer treatment. For example, in 2009, the So ciety of Integrative Onco logy issued clinical practice guidelines for doctors to consider when incorporating complementary therapies in the care of cancer patients. They have also hi ghlighted key points for the safe use of CAM in cancer treatment, for example, that CAM therapies should never be used as a replacement for conventional cancer care or as a reason to postpone seeing a doctor about any problem and that before using CAM, cancer patien ts should consult with their doctors. As an example to research programmes, Dr. ROSSI introduced the CAM-CANCER project (Concerted Action for Complementary and Alte rnative Medicine Assessment in the Cancer Field) which is an EU project originally funded by the European Commission within the Fifth Framework Programme and is now hosted by the University of Troms\u00f8 in Norway. 16 Workshop on 'Alternative Medicines'/Workshop Proceedings ____________________________________________________________________________________________ Dr. ROSSI explained that there are many cent res, courses, universities and conferences focusing on the use of CAM therapies in cancer treatment. The First International Conference on Integrative Care for the Future was held in the Netherlands in March 2011. Dr. ROSSI explained that his region of Tuscany has also extensive experience in integrative oncology. There are over 100 centres in the regi on providing CAM therapies to patients, such as acupuncture, homeopathy and herbal medicines. Out of these 100 centres, five of them are considered as integrative oncology clinics. The Tuscany-model of integrative oncology is ba sed on two pillars, physical activity and diet. As part of the physical activity, patients are tr eated with art therapy, such as dance or music a n d b y p s y c h o - o n c o l o g y . I n a d d i t i o n t o t h is, the centres use other CAM therapies and narrative medicines. Centres in the Tuscany re gion are also engaged in collecting clinical evidence about the health benefits of us ing CAM therapies in cancer treatment. Dr. ROSSI also mentioned that the Tuscany Regi on Network for Integrative Medicines is an associated partner of the European Partnership for Action Against Cancer (EPAAC), which was launched in 2009 after the European Commission published its Communication on Action Against Cancer: European Partnership. The EP AAC consists of 38 associated partners, and has over 90 collaborating partners. The National Institute of Public Health in Slovenia is the leader of the EPAAC Joint Action . According to Work Package 7 of EPAAC, a specific objective of the Tuscany Region is to assess the evidence and use of CAM in cancer care and to assess the dissemination of CAM as well to review the evidence and map the EU's CAM in cancer care. As part of its task, Tuscany Region is al so circulating a survey to the cancer units of hospitals across the EU to identify clinical activities related to integrative medicine. Dr. ROSSI said that the results of these tasks will be presented in September 2012 in Florence, at the Fifth European Congress for Integrative Medicine. In his concluding remark Dr. RO SSI referred to a statement of a famous oncologist who said that 'Integrative and complementary medici nes can be a bridge between patients and doctors; it can be a balance point where cure is complemented by care and ambition is mitigated by empathy.' 2.1.10. Second round of Questions & Answers After th e pr esentations of the seven selected speakers, Mr PETERLE opened the floor for questions. Question 1 The first question was addressed to Dr. ROSSI. One attendee of the workshop asked about how the integrative centres are connected and how cancer patients can get in touch with such specialised health care centres. She also asked whether the integrative centres are in contact with conventional health care centre s. This person also asked whether hospitals should meet certain criteria in order to join the network of integrative centres. Dr. ROSSI explained that setting up a network of integrative centres using CAM therapies in cancer treatment is the objective of the Euro pean Partnership for Action Against Cancer (EPAAC). Member organisations of this Partnership use similar therapies. Dr. ROSSI said that 17 Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy ____________________________________________________________________________________________ both private and public hospitals may join the network, in which patients are provided with the possibility of exercising their liberty of choosing among therapeutic approaches. Question 2 The second question was posed by Mr PETERLE and was addressed to Dr. BUCHINGER. Mr PETERLE asked about the estimated number of pati ents visiting the fasting clinic, and about the number of politicians making use of the therapies offered by the clinic. In his response, Dr. BUCHINGER explained that mostly businessmen and people from abroad visit his clinic. However, he also said that o ccasionally the clinic hosts politicians as well. In his reaction to Dr. BUCHINGER's answer, Mr PETERLE asked about th e percentage of those using fasting as a preventive measure and those using it as a curative therapy. Dr. BUCHINGER said that the number of patients using fasting as a preventive and curative therapy is equal. In addition, he pointed out that the number of patients suffering from metabolic diseases and type-2 diabetes increases every year. Dr. BUCHINGER said that fasting as a preventive therapy is more commonly used among younger patients. He explained that younger patients go to his clinic in order to learn more about healthy lifestyles. Dr. BUCHINGER also referred to the fact that patients are coming from all over the world to his fasting clinic, including the Middle East, Europe and the US. Moreover, Dr. BUCHINGER described that it is very important to be aware of the kinds of foodstuff available on the market. He said th at based on his experience, there are many products in the supermarkets which are unhealthy and contain too much e-additives. Dr. BUCHINGER also stated that many people have unhealthy eating habits. As an example h e r e f e r r e d t o t h e f a c t t h a t m a n y p e o p l e a r e e a t i n g f i v e t i m e s p e r d a y . H e s a i d t h a t t h e healthy way would be to limit the number of meals to three per day. Dr. BUCHINGER also mentioned that the shortest way to fast would be to skip the dinner, as this is the meal which is not necessary for the human body. Question 3 The third question was asked by Dr. CAMPBELL- MCBRIDE and was addressed to Mr PETERLE. Dr. CAMPBELL-MCBRIDE inquired whether the workshop would be followed by more meetings on CAM, and would lead to more progress in the area of CAM. In order to avoid misunderstanding, Mr PETERLE explained that this workshop is not the first to be organised on CAM-related topics, but 'the first workshop organised in this set-up'. M r P E T E R L E a l s o n o t e d t h a t t h e f u t u r e o f C A M i n E u r o p e d e p e n d s p r i m a r i l y o n t h e developments of the legal framework. In this respect, the European Commission has more power, given that it is the institution having the power of taking legal initiatives. However, he said that the European Parliament has the me ans to stimulate the European Commission in taking certain steps. As an example, Mr PETERLE referred to the European Parliament's self- initiative reports, and to its role in stimulating the decision-making process. 18 Workshop on 'Alternative Medicines'/Workshop Proceedings ____________________________________________________________________________________________ Mr PETERLE also said that in his opinion the cris is of Europe's health system will last longer than the current financial crisis. According to Mr PETERLE, the only way to solve the complex issues of Europe's health care system would be to shift the paradigm. Mr PETERLE noted that only two years ago, when the hearings of the current commissioners took place, about six candidates referred to the 'shift of paradigm' in their speeches. Mr PETERLE said that this indicates how urgent the need for change is. As a final remark, Mr PETERLE said that the past has already shown that the European Parliament together with the European Co mmission and the Council can achieve positive results in the field of alternative medicine. As an example, he mentioned cancer therapies and explained that projects, prog rammes and partnerships in this area are relatively new and were introduced by the institutions following the request of the European Parliament. Moreover, Mr PETERLE emphasized that 'health' is still a key challenge for the European Union. 2.2. PART 2: COMMENTS Dr Andrzej RYS, Director of th e Health Systems and Products Directorate of DG SANCO Dr. RYS first described the current status of alternative medicine in Europe. In this context he referred to the increasing number of European patients using alternative medicines and to the growing number of publications and scientific interests in this area. Dr. RYS also referred to the fact that 'the variety, categorisation and definition of alternative medicines render regulation and professional challenges.' As an example to professional challenges, he mentioned the problem of malpractice, and the different regulatory status of qualifications in the Member States. Dr. RYS emphasized that the European Commission is interested in this area. It regularly meets CAM organisations and supports CAM relate d research. As an example, he mentioned the CAMbrella project, which was establis hed under the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) in January 2010, with a total budget of EUR 1.5 million. He described that these 'soft instruments' are important tools to contri bute to the development of Europe. In addition to the 'soft tools', Dr. RYS referre d to the 'hard tools' used by the European Union. Dr. RYS associated these tools with legislative instruments, such as regulations and directives. In order to illustrate the complexity of the legislation on health, Dr. RYS explained that certain areas fall under the exclusive competence of Member States, whereas in some cases the EU and the Member States have shar ed competences. He also described that the EU legislation does not regulate CAM directly, but sets rules for the use and distribution of CAM products and the provision of CAM services. The first Directive which Dr. RYS mentioned was the Professional Qualifications Directive. 1 Dr. RYS confirmed that the Directive is under revisi on, and is currently subject to inter-service consultation. He explained the significance of the Directive to the health care sector by saying that 'according to DG MARKT, 46% of the professionals covered by the Directive are health professionals'. 1 Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on the recognition of professional qualifications, OJ L 255, 30.9.2005, p. 22-142 19 Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy ____________________________________________________________________________________________ As a second Directive, Dr. RYS presented the recently adopted Cross-border Health Directive,1 which focuses on the safe and good qual ity of treatments across borders. The Directive provides that patients are allowed to receive health care in other Member States and be reimbursed up to the level of costs that would have been assumed by the Member State of affiliation, if this health care had be en provided in their own Member State. As an important advantage of the Directive, Dr. RYS mentioned the provision and availability of sufficient level of information to patients. Dr. RYS also referred to the Medicinal Products Directive.2 He mentioned that in some countries, such as in Germany, Belgium or France, the use of homeopathic products and medicines have strong traditions, whereas in other countries these pr oducts and medicines are not commonly used. Dr. RYS mentioned that the main advantage of the Directive was the introduction of a market authorisation to homeopathic medicinal products. As a last element, with regard to homeopathic me dicinal products, Dr. RYS mentioned that the approach of practitioners towards such products vary across Europe. Dr. RYS also referred to the revision of th e Medicinal Products Directive by the Herbal Medicine Directive, 3 which has recently become fully operational, after the transitional period passed. The main aim of the Directive is to provide patients with a sufficient level of information and to ensure the safety and good quality of traditional medicinal products on the market. To this end, the Directive introduced a special simplified registration procedure for herbal medicines, including TCM and Ayurve da products. Dr. RYS also described the important role played by the European Medicine Agency in the registration process. Although many speakers of the workshop re ferred to the shortcom ings of the Herbal Medicines Directive, Dr. RYS said 'it is too early to say how the Directive is working', as it only recently has become fully operational, and a revision is not being considered at this stage. He said that the European Commission will continue to follow the field of Alternative Medicines and to support research in this area. As a last piece of relevant legislation, Dr. RYS referred to the Regulation on Nutrition and Food Claims 4 from 2006. In the context of the impl ementation of this Regulation, Dr. RYS mentioned the important role played by the European Food Safety Agency. Dr. RYS explained that this Regulation is important, as the bo rderline between food supplements and herbal medicines is not always clear. In his concluding remark, Dr. RYS emphasized that prevention is a priority topic for the European Commission and is in the heart of the European Health Strategy. Dr. RYS said that the European Commission together with the OECD is working on a report which will collect evidence on the economic benefits of prevention. He mentioned that this study may convince finance ministers and other political leaders in the EU that the 'shift of the paradigm' is necessary. Dr. RYS referred to the EU's efforts made with various stakeholders (e.g. NGOs, food industry, retailers) to reduce salt content in processed foods. 1 Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2011 on the application of patients' rights in cross-border health care, OJ L 88, 4.4.2011, p. 45-65 2 Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use 3 Directive 2004/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 amending, as regards traditional herbal medicinal products, Directive 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use 4 Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on nutrition and health claims made on foods 20 Workshop on 'Alternative Medicines'/Workshop Proceedings ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 2.3. PART 3: DISCUSSION Question 1 The first question was posed by Dr. NICOLAI and was addressed to Dr. RYS. Dr. NICOLAI asked whether the European Commission is planni ng to follow up on its statement made in its Communication (COM(2008)584). Dr. NICOLAI quoted the relevant paragraph of the Communication, which promised the revision of the Herbal Medicines Directive and the assessment of the suitability of a separate legal framework for alternative practices, such as Ayurveda or Traditional Chinese Medicine. Dr. RYS noted that at this stage the European Commission does not envisage a revision of the Directive. He explained that it is too ea rly to see how the Directive is working and whether it hinders the placing on the market of traditional herbal medicines. Following Dr. RYS's answer, Dr. GRAMMINGER claimed that given the current legislative framework which does not allow certain products t o b e r e g i s t e r e d a s t r a d i t i o n a l h e r b a l medicines, many practitioners in Europe are put in a situation in which they illegally use e.g. Ayurvedic and traditional Chinese products. In his response, Dr. RYS mentioned that produc ts need to meet certain criteria to be registered. As an example, he mentioned that the products need to have been on the market for at least 15 years and used in Europe fo r at least 30 years. He emphasized that the European Commission together with herbal me dicines associations constantly looks into possibilities to facilitate the regi stration of herbal medicines that meet the criteria referred to above. Question 2 Seamus CONNOLLY, the President of the Euro pean Federation for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, which represents almost 270000 non-medically trained practitioners in E u r o p e , s a i d t h a t h e f u l l y a g r e e d w i t h Dr. NICOLAI and Dr. GRAMMINGER's previous comments about the unsatisfactory legal fram ework. He said that according to many practitioners, the current Herbal Medicines Directive does not contribute to the safe access to herbal medicines. Mr CONNOLLY also mentioned that CAM practitioners are practising in a 'grey legal area'. In order to ensure the safe and effective a ccess to CAM medicines and modalities, Mr CONNOLLY said that the legal status of both pr actitioners and herbal medicines needs to be reassured and reconsidered. Fi nally, Mr CONNOLLY suggested to further discuss these issues in form of a separate meeting. In his response Dr. RYS listed the future occasions where these questions can be further discussed. In this context he mentioned a Conference next year and meetings of DG SANCO with CAM representatives in January. Question 3 G\u00fcnter SCHULZ, the Head of Office of the Intern ational Federation of Anthroposophic Medical Associations, in Brussels, encouraged Mr PETERLE to organise similar events in the future, probably in collaboration with other interest groups of the European Parliament. 21 Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy ____________________________________________________________________________________________ M r S C H U L Z a l s o a r g u e d t h a t M e m b e r s o f t h e E u r o p e a n P a r l i a m e n t s h o u l d t a k e t h e responsibility of preparing an own-initiative report on the CAM situation in Europe to support the general development and to show the European Commission where the gaps are and what could possibly be done. 2.4. CONCLUSIONS: MEP ALOJZ PETERLE I n h i s c o n c l u d i n g r e m a r k s , M r P E T E R L E s a i d t h a t t h e r e a r e p o i n t s w i t h r e g a r d t o t h e regulatory status of CAM practices and modalities which need to be further discussed. He said that despite the fact that regulating certain health-related areas fall within the competence of Member States, the European Union may play the role of stimulating certain harmonisation processes. As a problem, Mr PETERLE referred to the lack of knowledge about CAM practices and modalities in Europe. In this context, Mr PETERLE welcomed the recently adopted Cross-Border Health Directive, but emphasized the need for further comparative research. Mr PETERLE also said that 'we should pay more attention to possibilities which offer more p r e v e n t i o n i n E u r o p e . ' H e a r g u e d t h a t p a y i n g m o r e a t t e n t i o n t o m o r e n a t u r a l , e a s i l y accessible and simple methods of health care would be bene ficial to patients and would contribute to the prevention of diseases. Finally, Mr PETERLE addressed Mr SCHULZ's questi on, by saying that 'an own initiative report is the least the European Parliament can do'. MEP PETERLE thanked all of the speake rs for the interesting discussion. 22 Workshop on 'Alternative Medicines'/Workshop Proceedings ____________________________________________________________________________________________ ANNEX I: WORKSHOP PROGRAMME Policy Department A-Economy & Science for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) Working Group Health Workshop 'ALTERNATIVE MEDICINES' Wednesday, 30 November 2011 16.30 - 18.30 hrs European Parliament, Brussels Room Altiero Spinelli, A 5-G-2 AGENDA 16.30 Welcome and WILLMOTT (excused) and Alojz PETERLE, MEPs, Co-chairs of the Working Group on Health of the ENVI Committee 16.35 Traditional Chinese Medicine Dr Yu Han (China/United Kingdom) 16.45 Ayurvedic Medicine Dr Harsha Gramminger (Germany) 16.55 Homeopathy in Europe Dr Ton Nicolai (The Netherlands) 17.05 The Remedial Fasting Dr Andreas Buchinger (Germany). 17.15 First round of Questions & Answers 17.25 Nutritherapy for brain problems Dr Natasha Campbell-McBride Yugo slav Republic of Macedonia) 17.45 Complementary and Alternative Medicine for Cancer Dr Elio Rossi (Italy) 17.55 Second round of Questions & Answers 18.05 Comments Dr Andrzej Rys, Director He alth Systems & Products, European Commission DG SANCO 18.15 Discussion 18.25 Closing remarks by the Chair 18.30 End of meeting 23 Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy ____________________________________________________________________________________________ ANNEX II: SHORT BIOGRAPHIES OF EXPERTS Dr Yu Han, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Specialist, General Secretary of the UK Association of Traditional Chinese Medicines (UK, China) Dr Yu Han is a doctor of traditional Chinese medicines in the United Kingdom.

Harsha Gramminger: Ayurveda Workshop - \"ALTERNATIVE MEDICINES\" Wednesday, 30 November 2011 European Parliament Brussels 1 Ayurveda - Background Ayurveda is a 5000 year old comprehensive system of medicine It originates in the north of India It is currently used by more than a quarter of the world's population It is both: preventative and curative 2 8 Branches Ayurveda has 8 branches, each of which deals with a particular aspect of the medicine system Inner Medicine Ear nose and throat Surgery Obstetrics and Gynaecology Toxicology Psychology Rejuvenation and Geriatrics Reproductive Health 3 Ayurveda - Therapeutics Ayurveda makes use of a numbe r of different therapeutics such as Diet and lifestyle advice Medicines, oil massage Heat treatments Detoxification therapy called Pancha Karma Yoga and Meditation ... Just to mention a few...! 4 Ayurveda is Scientific Ayurveda is not \"quackery \" - it works on a scientifically measurable physiological and psychological level It helps to restore balance to the organism's disharmony which is expressed in terms of Vata, Pitta and Kapha 5 Individual Assessment Ayurveda treatment is prescribed on an individual basis It normally requires a long consultation pr ocess to arrive at the primary cause of the disease before reaching a diagnosis and treatment plan It is not a -One Hat Fits All - system 6 Example Approach for a patient suffering from hyperacidity or reflux oesophagitis Ayurveda looks for the cause of the acidity be it dietary, lifestyle, psychological, physiological, iatrogenic (primary or secondary), or occupational It gives dietary and lifestyle advice to neutralise the primary cause of acidity Together with medicines that restore the correct pH, improve the digestion and heal and support the tissues ... This is the holistic approach that is required for a full cure and this approach is applied to all Ayurvedic patients... 7 Ayurveda is good for: Ayurveda works particularly well for chronic diseases such as Burnout Diabetes Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia GIT conditions such as Malabsorbtion syndrome Muscular skeletal, rheumatic and neurol ogical conditions that can only at best be palliated using western medicines ... At the same time it works extrem ely effectively together with western medicine by reducing drug dosages, reducing secondary symptoms and reducing side effects... 8 Good for the Patients... The good news is: Patients, who would otherwise be long term drug dependent requiring complex medical interventions have the possibility of reducing or removing dependency by using Ayurvedic treatment! 9... Good for the MS (member states)! The Impact is that there would be huge financial and social benefits for the MS Healthcare Systems ! Prevention Ayurveda's comprehensive system seeks to prevent disease and maintain the health of healthy people In terms of the \"EU initiative to improve the healthy years of the aged\" ...Ayurveda can play a major role in ac hieving the two year target simply by giving suitable dietary and lifestyle advice... 10 Start Young It is a sensible system to teach in primary and secondary schools to prepare adults to become fully responsible for their own health As we know many diseases can be avoided given the correct education on diet and lifestyle with support by the EU and MS Health services 11 Patients' Freedom Treatments are currently available and patients try to inform themselves But: Insurance companies and govern mental bodies ar e not confident e n o u g h t o i n c l u d e A y u r v e d a o r m o s t o f t h e o t h e r a l t e r n a t i v e m e d i c a l systems in their scope of choice Funding for further research is required which would demonstrate its benefits and quantify the advantages 12 Missing Missing are the Centres for information and the necessary financing from the State and Insurance companies Alternative systems of medicine require long consultations and patients need to be able to afford these and their medicines and treatments 13 Who Pays? Currently only Allopathic medicine is financed by the State or Insurance companies This means, that all Ayurvedic cons ultations and treatments have to be paid by the patients A circumstance which reduces patient choice in an era where freedom to chose has been widely promoted 14 People Driven Furthermore there is an increasing interest throughout the population to maintain the body and mental fitness by living a more balanced and healthy lifestyle This is thus requiring health education for the public including instruction in suitable sports, yoga and meditation 15 Needs We need to have more Doctors trained and practicing Ayurvedic Medicine with Diet and Lifestyle advisors paid by the insurance companies and integrated into Nati onal Health Policy ... This will help to reduce and avoid disease and transfer valuable resources to more needy situations...! 16 Ayurveda We are ready to help to reduce the burden on healthcare budgets!

In 1919 he cured himself by his first fasting. He established the 'Klinik Dr. Otto Buchinger' in 1920. Since 1920, many people fasted in the Clinic Dr. Otto Buchinger in Bad Pyrmont. For most of the Fasting clients 'The Remedial Fasting' is a determining experience: physiologically advantageous and/or beneficial effects and lifestyle changes lead to sustainable improvements in the overall health status (and finally to cost savings ). Dr. Otto Buchinger II (born 1913, 2003) continued in Bad Pyrmont after WW II very successfully. He spread the message throughout Europe and Middle East, USA! 2 Klinik Dr. Buchinger Bad Pyrmont 221111DefinitionDefinition Fasting - according to both Drs. Otto Buchinger I and II -i s the conscious, voluntary renunciation of solid food for a limited period of time Fasting means nothing to chew, but to drink Fasting is multidimensional: it involves the physical, mental and spiritual dimension of fasters. The demand for energy is met from body reserves proven to protect vital structures of the body Fasting is a multidisciplinary approach that combines medicinal, physical therapy and exercise therapy with health education concepts (physical activities / nutrition) The Remedial Fasting is nota 'zerocaloriediet 'and nota administered) 3 Klinik Dr. Buchinger Bad Pyrmont 221111 Methodology: Components Methodology: Components Plenty of liquids (mineral waters, various teas, vegetable broths, fruitand vegetable juices), honey -m a x . 500kcal/day; occasionally additional buttermilk / yogurt, etc. Promotion of all elimination processes (intestines, kidneys, lungs, skin) Adequate balance between physical activities (sport as a very important component) and resting Careful reintroduction of healthy food and introduction of a healthier lifestyle (by health education) Prevention and therapy (e.g. metabolic 221111Various Kinds Of Fasting Various Kinds Of Fasting Various forms of Fasting Therapeutic fasting (= Fasting Therapy, or Remedial Fasting) Preventative fasting With patient care Stationary and medically directed attention and care for inpatients: specialized clinics Medically managed fasting for outpatients: practicing physicians There is also a socalled fasting for people in good health condition, as fasting here means only for (healthy) participants, good health condition proven by doctors 5 Klinik Dr. Buchinger Bad Pyrmont 221111 Related Fasting Methods Related Fasting Methods F. X. Mayr therapy: Fasting consists of 3 levels of an intestinal 1stlevel teawaterfasting, 2ndlevel milkbread diet, 3rdlevel light diet Schrothmethod: consisting of a carbohydrate pointed restrictive vegetarian diet, stimuli of dry days' alternating with small and large drinking days, and various elimination procedures such as mistor moist packs'. Alcohol is sometimes used as a remedy. Wheycure' and other variants: wheycure' = protein modified fasting using natural whey; 'mucus fasting' (whole grain oat flakes or buckwheat); more seldom teaor water fasting 6 visceral obesity, lipid disorders Cardiovascular system: e.g. high blood pressure, cardio vascular risk factors; disorders of the cardiovascular system Joints, soft parts: Rheumatoid arthritis; degenerative diseases of the musculoskeletal system, back pains, fibromyalgia Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, functional gastrointestinal disorders, fatty liver, other liver diseases Eczema / nettle rash / acne / psoriasis migraine Allergies: e.g. pollen allergies, food allergies Mood swings (e.g. heart failure NYHA > III) Advanced liverand renal failures Dementia Cancers (research under way) Psychoses Anorexia / bulimia Pregnancy / breast feeding 8 Klinik Dr. Buchinger Bad Pyrmont 221111Metabolic Changes Within Fasting Metabolic Changes Within Fasting Reduction in insulin production (insulin resistance ; results of insulinoverproduction Immobilization of the gastrointestinal tract, antigen pause, reduction of inflammatory processes The energy is delivered up to 95% from triglycerides, up to 5% from protein stores. This leads to the production of ketone bodies, which are (for example) used in turn to produce energy. Others (in the focus of research): reduction of IGF1 levels; Increased expression of Sirtuins; enormous anti inflammatory and antiaging effects 9 Klinik Dr. Buchinger Bad Pyrmont 221111 Medications To Be Observed Medications To Be Observed Antihypertensive medications Diabetes medications Systemic corticosteroids Psychotropic drugs (neuroleptics, lithium) / anti epileptic medications Anticoagulants NSAIDs (nonsteroidal drugs) Additional med's: more often magnesium potassium supplementation. Deficiencies re vitamins in or by Fasting are not proofed. Supplements might be administered in longer fasting periods or in detected deficiencies. After fasting very often medications have to be reduced (cost saving effect). In insulindependent type2diabetes a decreased insulin dosage may be expected or even a discontinuation of insulin. 10 Klinik Dr. Buchinger Bad Pyrmont 221111Methodology: Preliminary Examinations Methodology: Preliminary Examinations The following investigations are obligatory at the beginning of each fasting: Structured medicinal history Wholebody status Blood tests: complete blood cell counts, blood chemistry (e.g., minerals, liver and kidney function, uric acid), urine, TSH basal / T3/ T4, possibly hsCRP and others Blood pressure (BP), pulse Electrocardiogram; possibly exercise test Additional investigations (in case of suspicious symptoms): 24hrs. blood pressure monitoring, abdominal sonogram, vascular Pyrmont 221111 PossiblePossible Phenomena In Fasting Phenomena In Fasting Headaches (e.g. tension headache, caffeine withdrawal h.); possibly migraines; others Lumbago (lower back pains) Muscle cramps Sleep disorders Low blood pressure Intense dreams Not very often presented! Mood upswings (more often) 12 Klinik Dr. 221111Termination Criteria Termination Criteria gastrointestinal complaints (e.g. suspected gastric ulcer) Cardiac arrhythmias of highest grade Severe disorders of electrolyte balance (esp. sodium, potassium) Severe blood pressure regulation disorders of at least 2 days In practice, hardly ever seen! 13 Klinik Dr. Buchinger Bad Pyrmont 221111 General MethodologyGeneral Methodology Preparation days ('transition days') consisting of vegetables and then of fruit meals, should be performed 2 days before fasting starts Renunciation from stimulants Regular, daily physical activities (should become a habit) Mental and emotional adjustments: removal of relaxation hindering bad habits, less daily stresses, more time for rest and exercise. 'Inner experiences' (nature, music, literature, meditation) 14 Klinik Dr. Buchinger Bad Pyrmont 221111Methodology: Daily Fasting Methodology: Daily FastingBeveragesBeverages Fluid intake (~ 2.53 liters / day) has high priority! Fruit juices, sometimes diluted with mineral water; 0.250.5 liters max. Vegetable broths: 0.250.5 liters max. Tea's, plus organic honey max. 23 tsp distributed over the day Mineral waters (preferably no gas) 15 Klinik Dr. Buchinger Bad Pyrmont 221111 Methodology: Laxatives Methodology: Laxatives On the first day of Fasting once 3040gs sodium sulphate (NaSO 4) is administered, dissolved in 0.50.75 liters of water, to be sipped within 20 minutes (taste correction by an organic juice) Alternatives: passage salt, Epsom salt Reasons: the empty intestinal tract prevents the feeling of discomfort, but this also reduces the unwanted sensation of appetite (as some might call that wrongly 'hunger'); from that point on the faster feels 'clean' from inside! 16 Klinik Dr. Buchinger Bad Pyrmont 221111Methodology: Bowel Cleansing Methodology: Bowel Cleansing Procedures Within The Course Procedures Within The Course Necessary because of a decreased intestinal motility during fasting, because of continued bile secretion, as well as continued exfoliation of gastric and intestinal mucosa cells, and because of dead intestinal bacteria (otherwise, toxin exposure happens in nonelimination)! Every second day bowel enemas (lukewarm water), or alternatively passage salt (MgSO 4), or cabbage juice (depending also on personal preferences) 17 Klinik Dr. Buchinger Bad Pyrmont 221111 Methodology: Re Methodology: ReAlimentation Days) (Post Fasting Days) ,Break of Fast': stepwise reintroduction of solid food components to be chewed very well: 2 apples very well chewed morning & midday, in the evening a consistent potatovegetable soup 1st-4thbuildingup day: on the basis of easily ovolactovegetarian, 'whole foods' (foods from organic production) Target: prescribed calories (individually adjusted) to also introduce improved nutritional preferences (learning by selfexperience) 18 Klinik Dr. Buchinger Bad Pyrmont 221111Outcomes (Positive Effects) Outcomes (Positive Effects) Previously elevated lipids decrease significantly (both triglycerides and cholesterol) Blood sugar levels drop (because of a sustainable drop of insulin levels) -w h i c h also decreases the insulin resistance considerably (beneficial e.g. in metabolic syndrome and type2diabetes) Liver enzymes decrease (by e.g. the elimination of intracellular fat) Blood pressure decreases and normalizes The waist circumference decreases significantly; distinct weight losses The mobility increases significantly Increase of the sense of life and joy of life The overall positive outcomes are sustainable! The sum of the positive results through fasting are long lasting! Due to the included health education in the Remedial Fasting (in terms of exercise and nutrition) the participant (health insurances also) has -as a result -s i n c e r e sustainability of the successes plus cost savings !19 Klinik Dr. Buchinger Bad Pyrmont 221111 Research On Fasting Research On Fasting (excerpts) (excerpts) R Weindruch, Wisconsin Primate Research Center, Madison / USA: Fasting or caloric restriction, fasting and caloric restriction positive against ageing G Dobos, Department of Naturopathy and Integrative Medicine of the Clinics EssenMitte (GER): e.g. Glycotoxines & calorie restriction, fasting, lifeextension by fasting, delay agerelated diseases.

Cost effective Prevention is by far more cost effective than intervention.Source: BMJ Clinical evidence http://clinicalevidence.bmj.co m/ceweb/about/knowledge.jsp Thank you!Policy Department AEconomy & Science Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) Working Group on Health Workshop \"ALTERNATIVE MEDICINES\" Wednesday, 30 November 2011 European Parliament, Brussels Room Altiero Spinelli, A5G2 Complementary and Alternative Medicine in cancer Elio Rossi Tuscany Region Network for Integrative Medicine (Italy) CAM use in cancer treatment Many cancer patients use complementary and alternative therapies (CAM) in addition to conventional treatment , which may have implications for the clinical management of these patients. They need correct information. Herbal medicines and supplements were the most commonly used CAM therapies, together with homeopathy, vitamins/minerals, anthroposophic medicine, Chinese traditional medicine, spiritual therapies and relaxation techniques . The motivation to seek help from alternative treatment is not based on a distrust of conventional care. Maintaining hope and taking an active role in selfcare are the main stimuli for using alternative medicine. CAM cancer treatment vsconventional Most pediatric cancer patients, regardless of their ethnic origin, use CAM without informing their physicians . Some breast cancer patients opt for alternative treatments in place of conventional treatments . Alternative therapies used as primary treatment for breast cancer can be associated with increased recurrence and death . Homeopathy, if used instead of surgery, resulted in disease progression in most patients. (Chang et al. 2006).CAM prevalence in adult patients with cancer Systematic review (26 surveys/n=3649) -CAM use ranges from 764%, while average prevalence is 31.4% (Ernst & Cassileth 1998) US study (n=453) -83.3% had used at least one approach. -62.6% used vitamins/herbs (62.6%), 59.2% movement and physical therapies (Richardson et al. 2000) Europe study (n= 956) -35.9% uptake (least one form of CAM) (Molassiotis et al. 2005) CAM prevalence in children with cancer Surveys of families of children with cancer indicate that CAM is used worldwide: -with 31% to 46% use in the Netherlands, Finland, Australia, and Canada, and higher use (73%) in Taiwan (Post White & Hawkes 2005) UK study (n=49) -32.7% reported using some type of CAM -most commonly used therapies included multivitamins, aromatherapy massage, diets and music as therapy (Molassiotis & Cubbin 2004) Reviews and studies about CAM in cancer treatment (or Integrative oncology)EvidenceBased Clinical Practice Guidelines for Integrative Oncology Botanical supplements are among the most common CAM approaches used by cancer patients. A 2008 review of the research literature concluded that some botanicals used in Ayurvedic medicine and traditional Chinese medicine may have a role in cancer treatment. However, scientific evidence is limited \u2014much of the research on botanicals and cancer treatment is in the early stages. The review also notes that botanicals can have side effects and can interact with cancer drugs , blood thinners and other prescription drugs, and each other. Conclusions (EUSOMA 2004) The views expressed in this paper are those of the authors themselves, as it proved extremely difficult for all members of the workshop to reach a consensus on the current state of affairs, .... But one thing we all accept is that practitioners of conventional medicine and of CAM are working in good faith to improve the length and QoL for women with breast cancer. The way forward is to build bridges between the cultures based on the guidelines ... We choose to describe this as a consensual rather than an integrative approach. Anthroposophic treatment Viscum album, very diffused among cancer patients in North Europe To date, relatively little is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies that people may use for cancer. However, some CAM therapies have undergone careful evaluation, and many more studies are being carried out every year. In 2009, the Society for Integrative Oncology issued evidencebased clinical practice guidelines for doctors to consider when incorporating complementary therapies in the care of cancer patients.National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) Key Points in CAM cancer treatment of the Society for Integrative Oncology CAM therapies should never be used as a replacement for conventional cancer care or as a reason to postpone seeing a doctor about any problem. There is limited scientific evidence suggesting that some CAM approaches may be useful in managing some symptoms of cancer and side effects of treatment. At present, there is no convincing evidence regarding CAM use in preventing or curing cancer. Before using any CAM therapy, people who have been diagnosed with cancer should talk with the doctors who treat their condition \u2014to make sure that all aspects of their cancer care work together. Be aware that some dietary supplements can interfere with standard cancer treatments. Cancer patients need to make informed decisions about using CAM. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) and the National Cancer Institute have written a brochure that can help: Thinking About Complementary and Alternative Medicine: A Guide for People with Cancer www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/thinking aboutCAM In evaluating CAM therapies, people should be wary of extreme claims. Remember: if it sounds too good to be true\u2014for example, claims that a CAM therapy can cure cancer\u2014it usually is.

(www.IntegrativeCareftFuture.org ) The First International Conference on Integrative Care for the Future was held in The Netherlands on March 11 and 12 2011. Integrative medicine faces challenges as it attempts to develop a larger presence. The First International Conference addressed the economic, political, regulatory, educational and professional health care landscape in a diverse group of nations. It was chaired by Barrie Cassileth, PhD, Chief of the Integrative Medicine Service at Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center, New York\"CAMCancer\" is the name of a project entitled \"Concerted Action for Complementary and Alternative Medicine Assessment in the Cancer Field\" (CAMCancer). Originally funded by the European Commission (EC) within the Framework 5 Programme, it is now hosted by the National Information Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NIFAB) at the University of Troms\u00f8, Norway. The aims of the CAMCancer project were: to prepare and disseminate suitable evidencebased information for health professionals in order to assist them in informing their patients; to build an international authoritative network around CAM in cancer with a panel of experts in CAM research and/or in cancer care with privileged contacts with cancer organizations. European Partnership for Action Against Cancer (EPAAC) http://www.epaac.eu/ The European Partnership for Action Against Cancer (EPAAC) was launched in 2009, after the European Commission published its Communication on Action Against Cancer: European Partnership. The specificity of the Partnership is that it brings together the efforts of different stakeholders into a joint response to prevent and control cancer. In its initial phase, until early 2014, the work of the Partnership will be taken forward through a Joint Action (cofinanced by the EU Health Programme). The National Institute of Public Health in Slovenia has assumed the role of leader of the EPAAC Joint Action, which encompasses 38 associated partners from across Europe and over 90 collaborating partners.

Specific objective(s) of Tuscany Region To assess evidence and use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) in cancer care and to propose criteria for dissemination of appropriate information. Assessment of dissemination of CAM, review of the evidence (workshop) and mapping of the EU CAM in cancer care (survey). Survey to Cancer Units of Hospitals across EU to identify clinical activities related to integrative medicine. A map of the activities will be defined (M20). Workshop reviewing the evidence of the literature via Medline with the CAM therapies (herbal medicine, anthroposophy, homeopathy and acupuncture) will be reviewed. Also, interactions with chemotherapy will be analyzed. SIGN criteria will be used in grading literature . Experts form different EU centres (n=30) with published experience and representatives of scientific societies involved in cancer care will be invited to the final workshop in order to discuss the report. The final deliverable will be: Use of CAM in cancer care, with evidence reviewed. 5th European Congress for Integrative Medicine (ECIM) 2012 in Florence Italy ___________________________________________ ______________________________ 21st 22nd September 2012 5th European Congress for Integrative Medicine (ECIM) Palazzo dei Palazzo Vecchio Promoted by Tuscany Region -H e a l t h General Direction University Charit\u00e9 Berlin http://www.ecim-congress.org Conclusion Integrative/Complementary Medicine can be a bridge between Patients and Doctors.
