Any such notice, in writing, must comply with the requirements of subdivision a of :subsection 6. c. The provisions of subdivision b may not be interpreted as authorization to disregard instructions pursuant to subsection 2. 6. Requests by workers for inspections. a. Any worker or representative of workers believing that violations ,of North Dakota Century Code chapter 23-20.1 , this article, or license conditions exist or have occurred in work under a license ~or registration with regard to radiological working conditions in which the worker is engaged, may request an inspection by giving notice of the alleged violation to the department. Any such notice must be in writing, must set forth the specific grounds for the notice, and must be signed by the worker or representative of the workers. A copy must be provided to the licensee or registrant by the department no later than at the time of inspection except that, upon the request of the worker giving such notice, the worker's name and the name of individuals referred to therein may not .appear in such copy or on any record published, released, or made available by the department, except for good cause shown. 544 b. If, upon receipt of such notice, the department determines that the complaint meets the requirements set forth in subdivision a and that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the alleged violation exists or has occurred, an inspection must be made as soon as practicable, to determine if such alleged violation exists or has occurred. Inspections pursuant to this subsection need not be limited to matters referred to in the complaint. c. No lieef'lse licensee, registrant, or contractor or subcontractor of a licensee or registrant may discharge or in any manner discriminate against any worker because such worker has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under this article or has testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding or because of the exercise by such worker on behalf of the worker or others of any option afforded by this chapter. 7. Inspections not warranted -Informal review. a. (1) If the department determines, with respect to a complaint under subsection 6, that an inspection is not warranted because there are no reasonable grounds to believe that a violation exists or has occurred, the department shall notify the complainant in writing of such determination. The complainant may obtain review of such determination by submitting a written statement of position with the department which will provide the licensee or registrant with a copy of such statement by certified mail, excluding, at the request of the complainant, the name of the complainant. The licensee or registrant may submit an opposing written statement of position with the department which will provide the complainant with a copy of such statement by certified mail. (2) Upon the request of the complainant, the department may hold an informal conference in which the complainant and the licensee or registrant may orally present their views. An informal conference may also be held at the request of the licensee or registrant but disclosure of the identity of the complainant will be made only following receipt of written authorization from the complainant. The department shall render an informal opinion after the close of the conference. The complainant shall have the right of petition for a formal administrative hearing as provided for by North Dakota Century Code chapter 28-32 and North Dakota Administrative Code article 33-22, following the decision of such formal conference. b.

The rules in this chapter establish requirements for packaging, preparation for shipment and transportation of radioactive mate!rial and apply to any person who transports radioactive material or delivers radioactive material to a carrier for transport. To ensure compatibility with international transportation standards, all limits in this chapter are given in terms of dual units: The international system of units (SI) followed by United States customary units. The United States customary units are not exact equivalents, but are rounded to a convenient value, providing a functionally equivalent unit. Fer tne 1, 1992; amended effective May 1, 1998: March 1. NDCC 28-32-02 Law Implemented: NDCC 28-32-02 33-10-13\u00b7\u00b702. Definitions. As in this chapter, the following definitions apply: 1. \"Carrier\" means any person engaged in the \u00b7 transportation of pass,engers or property by land or water as a common, contract, o~ priivate carrier, or by civil aircraft. 2. \"Certificate holder'' means a person who has been issued a certificate of compliance or other package approval by the United States nuclear regulatory commission. 3. \"Cio~;e reflection by water\" means immediate contact by water of suffic:ient thickness for maximum reflection of neutrons. 4. \"Cio~;ed transport vehicle\" means a transport vehicle equipped with a securely attached exterior enclosure that during normal transportation restricts the access of unauthorized individuals to the cargo space containing the radioactive material. The enclosure may be either temporary or permanent but must limit access from top, sides, and ends .. In the case of packaged materials, it may be of the \"see-through\" type. 5. \"Containment system\" means the assembly of components of the pack:aging intended to retain the radioactive material during transport. 6. \"Conveyance\" means: a. For transport by public highway or rail: any transport vehicle or large freight container; b. For transport by water: any vessel, or any hold, compartment, or defined deck area of a vessel including any transport vehicle on board the vessel; and 602 c. For transport by aircraft: any aircraft. 7. \"Exclusive use\" means the sole use of a conveyance by a single consignor and for which all initial, intermediate, and final loading and unloading are carried out in accordance with the direction of the consignor or consignee. The consignor and the carrier must ensure that any loading or unloading is performed by personnel having radiological training and resources appropriate for safe handling of the consignment. The cosigner consignor must issue specific instructions, in writing, for maintenance or exclusive use shipment controls, and include them with the shipping paper information provided to the carrier by the cosigner consignor. combination of these radionuclides. Unirradiated natural uranium and depleted uranium, and natural uranium or depleted uranium that has been irradiated in thermal reactors only are not included in this definition. Department jurisdiction extends only to special nuclear material if quantities are not sufficient to form a critical mass as defined in chapter 33-10-01 of this article. 9. \"Fissile material package\" means a fissile material packaging together with its fissile material contents. 1 0. \"Low specific activity (LSA) material\" means radioactive material with limited specific activity that satisfies the descriptions and limits set forth below. Shielding materials surrounding the low specific activity material may not be considered in determining the estimated average specific activity of the package contents. Low specific activity material must be in one of three groups: a. Low specific activity-! (LSA-1). (1) Ores containing only naturally occurring radionuclides (e.g., uranium, thorium) and uranium or thorium concentrates of such ores; or (2) Solid unirradiated natural uranium or depleted uranium or natural thorium or their solid or liquid compounds or mixtures; or (3) Radioactive material, other than fissile material, for which the A2 value is unlimited; or (4) Mill tailings, contaminated earth, concrete, rubble, other debris, and activated material in which the radioactive material is essentially uniformly distributed, and the average 603 specific activity does not exceed one millionth of the A2 per gram. b. Low specific activity-11 (LSA-11). (1) Water with tritium concentration up to eight-tenths of a terabecquerel per liter [20.0 curies/liter]; or (2) Material in which the radioactive m~terial is distributed throughout, and the average specific activity does not exceed one ten thousandths of an A2 per gram for solids and gases, and one hundred thousandths of an A2 per gram for liquids. c. Low specific activity-Ill (LSA-111). Solids (e.g., consolidated wastes, activated materials) in which: (1) The radioactive material is distributed throughout a solid or \u00b7a collection of solid objects, or is essentially uniformly distributed in a solid compact binding agent, such as concrete, bitumen, ceramic, etc.; (2) The radioactive material\u00b7 is relatively insoluble, or it is intrinsically contained in a relatively insoluble material, so that, even under loss of packaging, the loss of radioactive material per package by leaching, when placed in water for seven days, would not exceed one-tenth of an A2; and (3) The average specific activity of the solid does not exceed two thousandths of an A2 per gram. 11. \"Maximum normal operating pressure\" means the maximum gauge press;ure that would develop in the containment system in a period of one year under the heat condition specified in 10 CFR 71.71(c)(1), in the~ absence of venting, external cooling by an ancillary system, or operational controls during transport. 12. \"Normal form radioactive material\" means radioactive material which has not been demonstrated to qualify as special form radioactive material. 13. \"Optimum interspersed hydrogenous moderation\" means the presence of hydrogenous material between packages to such an extent that the maximum nuclear reactivity results. 14. \"Rule!S of the United States department of transportation\" means the regulations in 49 CFR parts 100-189. 604 15. \"Specific activity\" of a radionuclide means the radioactivity of a radionuclide per unit mass of that nuclide. The specific activity of a material in which the radionuclide is essentially uniformly distributed is the radioactivity per unit mass of the material. 16. \"Transport index\" means the dimensionless number, rounded up to the first decimal place, placed on the label of a package to designate the degree of control to be exercised by the carrier during transportation. The transport index is determined as follows: a. For nonfissile material packages, the number determined by multiplying the maximum radiation level in millisievert (mSv) per hour at one meter [3.3 feet] from the external surface of the package by one hundred (equivalent to the maximum radiation level in millirem per hour at one meter [3.3 feet]); or b. For fissile material packages, the number determined by multiplying the maximum radiation level in millisievert per hour at one meter [3.3 feet] from the external surface of the package by one hundred (equivalent to the maximum radiation level in millirem per hour at one meter [3.3 feet]), or, for criticality control purposes, the number obtained as described in 10 CFR 71.59, whichever is larger. 17. \"Type A quantity\" means a quantity of radioactive material, the aggregate radioactivity of which does not exceed A1 for special form radioactive material or A2 for normal form radioactive material, where A1 and A2 are given in appendix A of this chapter or may be determined by procedures described in appendix A of this chapter. 18. \"Type B package\" means a Type B packaging together with its radioactive contents. A Type B package design is designated as B(U) or B(M). B(U) refers to the need for unilateral approval of international shipments; B(M) refers to the need for multilateral approval. There is no distinction made in how packages with these designations may be used in domestic transportation. To determine their distinction for international transportation, refer to 49 CFR part 173. A Type B package approved prior to September 6, 1983, was designated only as Type B. Limitations on its use are specified in section 33-1 0-13-08. 19. \"Type B packaging\" means a packaging designed to retain the integrity of containment and shielding when subjected to the normal conditions of transport and hypothetical accident test conditions set forth in 10 CFR part 71. 605 20. \"Typt: 8 quantity\" means a quantity of radioactive material greater than a Type A quantity.

History: Effective March 1. and A?:. 1.. Valuels of A1 and A2 for individual radionuclides. which are the bases for many activity limits elsewhere in these rules are given in Table I. The curie (Ci) values specified are obtained by converting from the Terabecguerel (TBg) figure. The curie values are expressed to three significant figures to assure that the difference in the TBg and Ci guantities is one-tenth of one percent or less. Where values of A1...Q[ A2 are unlimited. it is for radiation control purposes only. For nucfear cnticality safety, some materials are subject to controls placed on fissile material. 2. For individual radionuclides whose identities are known. but which are not listed in Table I. the determination of the values of A1 and A2 reguires depa1rtment approval. except that the values of A1 and A2 in Taole II may be used without obtaining department approval.- - 3.

Sealed sources installed after July 1, 1993: (1) Must have a certificate of registration issued under 10 Code of Federal Regulations 32.210. (2) Must be doubly encapsulated. (3) Must use radioactive material that is as nondispersible as practical and that is as insoluble as practical if the source is used in a wet-source-storage or wet-source-change irradiator. (4) Must be encapsulated in. a material resistant to general corrosion and to localized corrosion, such as 316L stainless steel or other material with equivalent resistance if the sources are for use in irradiator pools. (5) In prototype testing of the sealed source, must have been leak tested and found leak-free after each of the tests described in paragraphs b through g. b. Temperature. The test source must be held at minus forty degrees Centigrade for twenty minutes, six hundred degrees Centigrade for one hour, and then be subjected to a thermal shock test with a temperature drop from six hundred degrees Centigrade to twenty degrees Centigrade within fifteen seconds. c. Pressure. The test source must be twice subjected for at least five minutes to an external pressure (absolute) of two million newtons per square meter. d. Impact. A two kilogram steel weight, two and five-tenths centimeters in diameter, must be dropped from a height of one meter onto the test source. e. Vibration. The test source must be subjected three times for ten minutes each to vibrations sweeping from twenty-five hertz to five hundred hertz with a peak amplitude of five times the acceleration of gravity. In addition, each test source must be vibrated for thirty minutes at each resonant frequency found. 621 f. Puncture. A fifty gram weight and pin, three-tenths centimeter pin diameter, must be dropped from a height of one meter onto the test :source. g. Bend. If the length of the source is more than fifteen times larger than the minimum cross-sectional dimension, the test source must lbe subjected to a force of two thousand newtons at its center 'equidistant from two support cylinders, the distance between which is ten times the minimum cross-sectional dimension of the :source. 2. ACCE!SS control. a. Each entrance to a radiation room at a panoramic irradiator must !have a door or other physical barrier to prevent inadvertent entry of personnel if the sources are not in the shielded position. Product conveyor systems may serve as barriers as long as they reliably and consistently function as a barrier. It must not be possible to move the sources out of their shielded position i.f the door or barrier iis open. Opening the door or barrier while the sources are exposed must cause the sources to return promptly to their shielded position. The personnel entrance door or barrier must have a lock that is operated by the same key used to move the sources. The doors i:lnd barriers must not prevent any individual in the radiation room ifrom leaving. b. lin addition, each entrance to a radiation room at a panoramic iirradiator must have an independent backup access control to detect personnel entry while the sources are exposed. Detection 1:>f entry while the sources are exposed must cause the sources 1to return to their fully shielded position and must also activate a visible and audible alarm to make the individual entering the room aware of the hazard. The alarm must also alert at least one other iindividual who is onsite of the entry. That individual shall be trained 1:>n how to respond to the alarm and prepared to promptly render 1:>r summon assistance. c. A radiation monitor must be provided to detect the presence ,of high radiation levels in the radiation room of a panoramic iirradiator before personnel entry. The monitor must be integrated with personnel access door locks to prevent room access when radiation levels are high. Attempted personnel entry, while the monitor measures high radiation levels, must activate the alarm described in paragraph b. The monitor may be located in the 'entrance (normally referred to as the maze) but not in the direct radiation beam. d. Before the sources move from their shielded position in a panoramic irradiator, the source control must automatically 622 activate conspicuous visible and audible alarms to alert people in the radiation room that the sources will be moved from their shielded position. The alarms must give individuals enough time to leave the room before the sources leave the shielded position. e. Each radiation room at a panoramic irradiator must have a clearly visible and readily accessible control that would allow an individual in the room to make the sources return to their fully shielded position. f. Each radiation room of a panoramic irradiator must contain a control that prevents the sources from moving from the shielded position unless the control has been activated and the door or barrier to the radiation room has been closed within a preset time after activation of the control. g. Each entrance to the radiation room of a panoramic irradiator and each entrance to the area within the personnel access barrier of an underwater irradiator must reguired by subsection 2 of section 33-10-04.1-13. Radiation postings for panoramic irradiators must comply with the posting reguirements of subsection 2 of section 33-1 0-04.1-13, except that signs may be removed, covered, or otherwise made inoperative when the sources are fully shielded. h. If the radiation room of a panoramic irradiator has roof plugs or other movable shielding, it must not be possible to operate the irradiator unless the shielding is in its proper location. This requirement may be met by interlocks that prevent operation if shielding is not placed properly or by an operating procedure requiring inspection of shielding before operating. i. Underwater irradiators must have a personnel access barrier around the pool which must be locked to prevent access when the irradiator is not attended. Only operators and facility management may have access to keys to the personnel access barrier. There must be an intrusion alarm to detect unauthorized entry when the personnel access barrier is locked. Activation of the intrusion alarm must alert an individual (not necessarily onsite) who is prepared to respond or summon assistance. 3. Shielding. a. The radiation dose rate in areas that are normally occupied during operation of a panoramic irradiator may not exceed two hundredths millisievert [2 millirems] per hour at any location thirty centimeters 623 or more from the wall of the room when the sources are exposed. The dose rate must be averaged over an area not to exceed one hundred square centimeters having no linear dimension greater than twenty centimeters. Areas where the radiation dose rate E~xceeds two hundredths millisievert [2 millirems] per hour must be locked, roped off, or posted. b. The radiation dose at thirty centimeters over the edge of the pool e>f a pool irradiator may not exceed two hundredths millisievert [2 millirems] per hour when the sources are in the fully shielded position. c. The radiation dose rate at one meter from the shield of a dry-source-storage panoramic irradiator when the source is ~>hielded may not exceed two hundredths millisievert [2 millirems] per hour and at five centimeters from the shield may not exceed two-tenths millisievert [20 millirems] per hour. 4. Fire jprotection. a. The radiation room at a panoramic irradiator must have heat and ~>make detectors. The detectors must activate an audible alarm. The alarm must be capable of alerting a person who is prepared to summon assistance promptly. The sources must automatically become fully shielded if a fire is detected. b. The radiation room at a panoramic irradiator must be equipped with a fire extinguishing system capable of extinguishing a fire without the entry of personnel into the room. The system for the radiation room must have a shutoff valve to control flooding into unrestricted areas. 5. Radiation monitors. a. Irradiators with automatic product conveyor systems must have ;a radiation monitor with an audible alarm located to detect loose radioactive sources that are carried toward the product c~xit. If the monitor detects a source, an alarm must sound and product conveyors must stop automatically. The alarm must be capable of alerting an individual in the facility who is prepared to :summon assistance. Underwater irradiators in which the product moves within an enclosed stationary tube are exempt from the 1~equirements of this paragraph. b. Underwater irradiators that are not in a shielded radiation room must have a radiation monitor over the pool to detect abnormal radiation levels. The monitor must have an audible alarm and ;a visible indicator at entrances to the personnel access barrier around the pool. The audible alarm may have a manual shutoff. 624 The alarm must be capable of alerting an individual who is prepared to respond promptly. 6. Control of source movement. a. The mechanism that moves the sources of a panoramic irradiator must require a key to actuate. Actuation of the mechanism must cause an audible signal to indicate that the sources are leaving the shielded position. Only one key may be in use at any time, and only operators or facility management may possess it. The key must be attached to a portable radiation survey meter by a chain or cable. The lock for source control must be designed so that the key may not be removed if the sources are in an unshielded position. The door to the radiation room must require the same key. b. The console of a panoramic irradiator must have a source position indicator that indicates when the sources are in the fully shielded position, when they are in transit, and when the sources are exposed. c. The control console of a panoramic irradiator must have a control that promptly returns the sources to the shielded position. d. Each control for a panoramic irradiator must be clearly marked as to its function. 7. Irradiator pools. a. For licenses initially issued after July 1, 1993, irradiator pools must either: ( 1) Have a watertight stainless steel liner or a liner metallurgically compatible with other components in the pool; or (2) Be constructed so that there is a low likelihood of substantial leakage and have a surface designed to facilitate decontamination. In either case, the licensee shall have a method to safely store the sources during repairs of the pool. b. For licenses initially issued after July 1, 1993, irradiator pools must have no outlets more than five-tenths meter below the normal low water level that could allow water to drain out of the pool. Pipes that have intakes more than five-tenths meter below the normal low water level and that could act as siphons must have siphon breakers to prevent the siphoning of pool water. c. A means must be provided to replenish water losses from the pool. 625 d. A visible indicator must be provided in a clearly visible location to indicate if the pool water level is below the normal low water level or above the normal high water level. e. Irradiator pools must be equipped with a purification system designed to be capable of maintaining the water during normal operation at a conductivity of twenty microsiemens per centimeter or less and with a clarity so that the sources can be seen clearly. f. A physical barrier, such as a railing or cover, must be used around or over irradiator pools during normal operation to prevent personnel from accidentally falling into the pool. The barrier may be removed during maintenance, inspection, and service operations. g. If long-handled tools or poles are used in irradiator pools, the radiation dose rate on the handling areas of the tools may not exceed two hundredths millisievert [2 millirems] per hour. 8. Source rack protection. If the product to be irradiated moves on a product conveyor system, the source rack and the mechanism that moves the rack must be protected by a barrier or guides to prevent products and product carriers from hitting or touching the rack or mechanism. 9. Power failures. a. If electrical power at a panoramic irradiator is lost for longer than ten seconds, the sources must automatically return to the shielded position. b. The lock on the door of the radiation room of a panoramic irradiator may not be deactivated by a power failure. c. During a power failure, the area of any irradiator where sources are located may be entered only when using an operable and calibrated radiation survey meter.

Detection of leaking sources. a. lEach dry-source-storage sealed source must be tested for leakage at intervals not to exceed six months using a leak test kit or method approved by the department, the United States nuclear regulatory commission, or an agreement state. In the absence of a certificate 'from a transferor that a test has been made within the six months !before the transfer, the sealed source may not be used until tested. 634 The test must be capable of detecting the presence of two hundred becquerels [0.005 microcurie] of radioactive material and must be performed by a person approved by the department, the United States nuclear regulatory commission, or an agreement state to perform the test. b. For pool irradiators, sources may not be put into the pool unless the licensee tests the sources for leaks or has a certificate from a transferor that leak test has been done within the six months before the transfer. Water from the pool must be checked for contamination each day the irradiator operates. The check may be done either by using a radiation monitor on a pool water circulating system or by analysis of a sample of pool water. If a check for contamination is done by analysis of a sample of pool water, the results of the analysis must be available within twenty-four hours. If the licensee uses a radiation monitor on a pool water circulating system, the detection of above normal radiation levels must activate an alarm. The alarm set-point must be set as low as practical, but high enough to avoid false alarms. The licensee may reset the alarm set-point to a higher level if necessary to operate the pool water purification system to clean up contamination in the pool if specifically provided for in written emergency procedures. c. If a leaking source is detected, the licensee shall arrange to remove the leaking source from service and have it decontaminated, repaired, or disposed of by a department, United States nuclear regulatory commission, or agreement state licensee that is authorized to perform these functions. The licensee shall promptly check its personnel, equipment, facilities, and irradiated product for radioactive contamination. No product may be shipped until the product has been checked and found free of contamination. If a product has been shipped that may have been inadvertently contaminated, the licensee shall arrange to locate and survey that product for contamination. If any personnel are found to be contaminated, decontamination must be performed promptly. If contaminated equipment, facilities, or products are found, the licensee shall arrange to have them decontaminated or disposed of by a department, United States nuclear regulatory commission, or agreement state licensee that is authorized to perform these functions. If a pool is contaminated, the licensee shall arrange to clean the pool until the contamination levels do not exceed the appropriate concentration in table II, column 2, appendix B to chapter 33-10-04.1.

The capacity of such installations !)hall be the manufacturer's or designer's guaranteed maximum heat input rate. c.-This chapter does not apply to installations which are subject to a !)Uifur dioxide emission limit under chapter 33-15-12. d. For purposes of this chapter, equipment at an oil and gas production facility, as defined in chapter 33-15-20, is considered industrial process equipment. e. Jhis chapter does not apply to installations that burn pipeline .c~uality natural gas or A.S.T.M. commercial propane alone or in ~:ombination with each other. Installations that burn pipeline guality natural gas or A.S.T.M. commercial propane in combination with pther fuels are subject to the reguirements of this chapter. 2. Restrictions applicable to fuel burning installations. No person shall cause or permit the emission of sulfur dioxide to the ambient air from any fuel burning installation in an amount greater than three and zero-tenths pounds of sulfur dioxide per million British thermal units [1290 nanograms/joule] of heat input to the installation on a one-hour-block-average basis. The department may establish alternative averaging periods provided the requirements of chapter 33-1 :5-02 are met. All averaging periods must begin on the hour and avenaging periods greater than one hour must be rolling averages. 3. The department shall establish more restrictive emission limits for a source if it is determined that such source is causing the ambient air quality standards of chapter 33-15-02 or the prevention of significant dete1ioration increments of chapter 33-15-15 for sulfur dioxide to be e1xceeded. However, the department may consider alternative 656 measures which will achieve compliance with the ambient air quality standards or prevention of significant deterioration increments.

Notwithstanding the shield provisions of subdivision f, the source shall be subject to enforcement action for operation without a title V permit to operate if the source is later determined not to qualify for the conditions and terms of the general permit. General permits shall not be authorized for affected sources under the acid rain program unless otherwise provided in regulations promulgated under title IV of the Federal Clean Air Act. The 712 department is not required to issue a general permit in lieu of individual title V permits. (2) Title V sources that would qualify for a general permit must apply to the department for coverage under the terms of the general permit or must apply for a title V permit to operate consistent with subsection 4. The department may, in the general permit, provide for applications which deviate from the requirements of subsection 4, provided that such applications meet the requirements of title V of the Federal Clean Air Act, and include all information necessary to determine qualification for, and to assure compliance with, the general permit. Without repeating the public participation procedures required under subdivision h of subsection 6, the department may grant a source's request for authorization to operate under a general permit, but such a grant shall not be a final permit action for purposes of judicial review. e. Temporary sources. The department may issue a single permit authorizing emissions from similar operations by the same source owner or operator at multiple temporary locations. The operation must be temporary and involve at least one change of location during the term of the permit. No affected source shall be permitted as a temporary source. Permits for temporary sources shall include the following: (1) Conditions that will assure compliance with all applicable requirements at all authorized locations; (2) Requirements that the owner or operator notify the department at least ten days in advance of each change in location; and (3) Conditions that assure compliance with all other provisions of this section. f. Permit shield. (1) Except as provided in this section, upon written request by the applicant, the department shall include in a title V permit to operate a provision stating that compliance with the conditions of the permit shall be deemed compliance with any applicable requirement as of the date of permit issuance, provided that: (a) Such applicable requirements are included and are specifically identified in the permit; or 713 (b) The department, in acting on the permit application or revision, determines in writing that other requirements specifically identified are not applicable to the source, and the permit includes the determination or a concise summary thereof. (2) A title V permit that does not expressly state that a permit shield exists shall be presumed not to provide such a shield. (3) Nothing in this subdivision or in any title V permit shall alter or affect the following: (a) The provisions of section 303 of the Federal Clean Air Act (emergency orders), including the authority of the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency under that section; (b) The liability of an owner or operator of a source for any violation of applicable requirements prior to or at the time of permit issuance; \u00b7 (c) The applicable requirements of the acid rain program, consistent with section 408(a) of the Federal Clean Air Act; or (d) The ability of the United States environmental protection agency to obtain information from a source pursuant to section 114 of the Federal Clean Air Act. g. Emergency provision. (1) An \"emergency\" means any situation arising from sudden and reasonably unforeseeable events beyond the control of the source, including acts of God, which situation requires immediate corrective action to restore normal operation, and that causes the source to exceed a technology-based emissions limitation under the title V permit to operate, due to unavoidable increases in emissions attributable to the emergency. An emergency shall not include noncompliance to the extent caused by improperly designed equipment, lack of preventive maintenance, careless or improper operation, or operator error. (2) Effect of an emergency. An emergency constitutes an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with such technology-based emissions limitations if the conditions of paragraph 3 are met. 714 (3) The affirmative defense of emergency shall be demonstrated through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: (a) An emergency occurred and that the permittee can identify the causes of the emergency; (b) The permitted facility was at the time being properly operated; (c) During the period of the emergency the permittee took all reasonable steps to minimize levels of emissions that exceeded the emissions standards, or other requirements in the permit; and (d) The permittee submitted notice of the emergency to the department within one working day of the time when emissions limitations were exceeded due to the emergency. This notice fulfills the requirement of item 2 of subparagraph c of paragraph 3 of subdivision a. This notice must contain a description of the emergency, any steps taken to mitigate emissions, and corrective actions taken. (4) In any enforcement proceeding, the permittee seeking to establish the occurrence of an emergency has the burden of proof. (5) This provision is in addition to any emergency or upset provision contained in any applicable requirement and the malfunction notification required under subdivision b of subsection 2 of section 33-15-01-13 when a threat to health and welfare would exist. 6. Permit issuance, renewal, reopenings, and revisions. a. Action on application. (1) A permit, permit modification, or permit renewal may be issued only if all of the following conditions have been met: (a) The department has received a complete application for a permit, permit modification, or permit renewal, except that a complete application need not be received before issuance of a general permit under subdivision d of subsection 5; (b) Except for modifications qualifying for minor permit modification procedures under paragraphs 1 and 2 715 of subdivision e, the department has complied with the requirements for public participation under subdivision h; (c) The department has complied with the requirements for notifying and responding to affected states under subdivision b of subsection 7; (d) The conditions of the permit provide for compliance with all applicable requirements and the requirements of this section; and (e) The administrator of the United States environmental protection agency has received a copy of the proposed permit and any notices required under subdivisions a and b of subsection 7, and has not objected to issuance of the permit under subdivision c of subsection 7 within the time period specified therein. (2) Except for applications received during the initial transitional period described in 40 CFR 70.4(b)(11) or under regulations promulgated under title IV or title V of the Federal Clean Air Act for the permitting of affected sources under the acid rain program, the department shall take final action on each permit application, including a request for permit modification or renewal, within eighteen months after receiving a complete application. (3) The department shall provide notice to the applicant of whether the application is complete. Unless the department requests additional information or otherwise notifies the applicant of incompleteness within sixty days of receipt of an application, the application shall be deemed complete. For modifications processed through the minor permit modification procedures, in paragraphs 1 and 2 of subdivision e, a completeness determination is not required. (4) The department shall provide a statement that sets forth the legal and factual basis for the draft permit conditions, including references to the applicable statutory or regulatory provisions. The department shall send this statement to the United States environmental protection agency and to any other person who requests it. (5) The submittal of a complete application shall not affect the requirement that any source have a permit to construct under section 33-15-14-02. b. Requirement for a permit. 716 (1) Except as provided in the following sentence, paragraphs 2 and 3, subparagraph e of paragraph 1 of subdivision e, and subparagraph e of paragraph 2 of subdivision e, no title V source may operate after the time that it is required to submit a timely and complete application under this section, except in compliance with a permit issued under this section. If a title V source submits a timely and complete application for permit issuance, including for renewal, the source's failure to have a title V permit is not a violation of this section until the department takes final action on the permit application, except as noted in this subsection. This protection shall cease to apply if, subsequent to the completeness determination made pursuant to paragraph 3 of subdivision a, and as required by paragraph 2 of subdivision a of subsection 4, the applicant fails to submit by the deadline specified in writing by the department any additional information identified as being needed to process the application. For timely and complete renewal applications for which the department has failed to issue or deny the renewal permit before the expiration date of the previous permit, all the terms and conditions of the permit, including the permit shield that was granted pursuant to subdivision f of subsection 5 shall remain in effect until the renewal permit has been issued or denied. (2) A permit revision is not required for section 502(b)(10) changes provided: (a) The changes are not modifications under chapters 33-15-12, 33-15-13, and 33-15-15 or title I of the Federal Clean Air Act. (b) The changes do not exceed the emissions allowable under the title V permit whether expressed therein as a rate of emissions or in terms of total emissions. (c) A permit to construct under section 33-15-14-02 has been issued, if required. (d) The facility provides the department and the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency with written notification at least seven days in advance of the proposed change. The written notification shall include a description of each change within the permitted facility, the date on which the change will occur, any change in emissions, and any permit term or condition that is no longer applicable as a result of the change. 717 The permit shield described in subdivision f of subsection 5 shall not apply to any change made pursuant to this paragraph. (3) A permit revision is not required for changes that are not addressed or prohibited by the permit provided: (a) Each such change shall meet all applicable requirements and shall not violate any existing permit term or condition. (b) The source must provide contemporaneous written notice to the department and the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency of each such change, except for changes that qualify as insignificant under the provisions of subdivision c of subsection 4. Such written notice shall describe each such change, including the date, any change in emissions, contaminants emitted, ~nd any applicable requirement that would apply as a result of the change. (c) The permittee shall keep a record describing changes made at the source that result in emissions of a regulated air contaminant subject to an applicable requirement, but not otherwise regulated under the permit, and the emissions resulting from those changes. (d) The changes are not subject to any requirements under title IV of the Federal Clean Air Act. (e) The changes are not modifications under chapters 33-15-12, 33-15-13, and 33-15-15 or any provision of title I of the Federal Clean Air Act. (f) A permit to construct under section 33-15-14-02 has been issued, if required. The permit shield described in subdivision f of subsection 5 shall not apply to any change made pursuant to this paragraph. c. Permit renewal and expiration. (1) Permits being renewed are subject to the same procedural requirements, including those for public participation, affected state and the United States environmental protection agency review, that apply to initial permit issuance; and 718 (2) Permit expiration terminates the source's right to operate unless a timely and complete renewal application has been submitted consistent with subdivision b of subsection 6 and subparagraph c of paragraph 1 of subdivision a of subsection 4. d. Administrative permit amendments. (1) An \"administrative permit amendment\" is a permit revision that: (a) Corrects typographical errors; (b) Identifies a change in the name, address, or ptiefle telephone number of any person identified in the permit, or provides a similar minor administrative change at the source; (c) Requires more frequent monitoring or reporting by the permittee; (d) Allows for a change in ownership or operational control of a source wtier=e if the department determines that no other change in the permit is necessary, provided that a written agreement containing a specific date for transfer of permit responsibility, coverage, and liability between the current and new permittee has been submitted to the department; (e) Incorporates into the title V permit the requirements from a permit to construct, provided that the permit to construct review procedure is substantially equivalent to the requirements of subsections 6 and 7 that would be applicable to the change if it were subject to review as a permit modification, and compliance requirements substantially equivalent to those contained in subsection 5; or (f) Incorporates any other type of change which the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency has approved as being an administrative permit amendment as part of the approved title V operating permit program. (2) Administrative permit amendments for purposes of the acid rain portion of the permit shall be governed by regulations promulgated under title IV of the Federal Clean Air Act. 719 (3) Administrative permit amendment procedures. An administrative permit amendment may be made by the department consistent with the following: (a) The department shall take no more than sixty days from receipt of a request for an administrative permit amendment to take final action on such request, and may incorporate such changes without providing notice to the public or affected states provided that it designates any such permit revisions as having been made pursuant to this subdivision. (b) The department shall submit a copy of the revised permit to the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency. (c) The source may implement the changes addressed in the request for an administrative amendment immediately upon submittal of the request provided a permit to construct under section 33-15-14-02 has been issued, if required. (4) The department may, upon taking final action granting a request for an administrative permit amendment, allow coverage by the permit shield in subdivision f of subsection 5 for administrative permit amendments made pursuant to subparagraph e of paragraph 1 of subdivision d which meet the relevant requirements of subsections 5, 6, and 7 for significant permit modifications. e. Permit modification. A permit modification is any revision to a title V permit that cannot be accomplished under the provisions for administrative permit amendments under subdivision d. A permit modification for purposes of the acid rain portion of the permit shall be governed by regulations promulgated under title IV of the Federal Clean Air Act. (1) Minor permit modification procedures. (a) Criteria. [1] Minor permit modification procedures may be used only for those permit modifications that: [a] Do not violate any applicable requirement; [b] Do not involve significant changes to existing monitoring, reporting, or recordkeeping requirements in the permit; 720 [c] Do not require or change a case-by-case determination of an emissions limitation or other standard, or a source-specific determination for temporary sources of ambient impacts, or a visibility or increment analysis; [d] Do not seek to establish or change a permit term or condition for which there is no corresponding underlying applicable requirement and that the source has assumed to avoid an applicable requirement to which the source would otherwise be subject. Such terms and conditions include a federally enforceable emissions cap assumed to avoid classification as a modification under any provision of title I of the Federal Clean Air Act; and an alternative emissions limit approved pursuant to regulations promulgated under section 112(i)(5) of the Federal Clean Air Act; [e] Are not modifications under chapters 33-15-12, 33-15-13, and 33-15-15 or any provision of title I of the Federal Clean Air Act; and [f] Are not required to be processed as a significant modification. [2] Notwithstanding item 1 and subparagraph a of paragraph 2 of subdivision e, minor permit modification procedures may be used for permit modifications involving the use of economic incentives, marketable permits, em1ss1ons trading, and other similar approaches, to the extent that such minor permit modification procedures are explicitly provided for in the state implementation plan, or in applicable requirements promulgated by the United States environmental protection agency. (b) Application. An application requesting the use of minor permit modification procedures shall meet the requirements of subdivision c of subsection 4 and shall include the following: 721 [1] A description of the change, the emissions resulting from the change, and any new applicable requirements that will apply if the change occurs; [2] The source's suggested draft permit; [3] Certification by a responsible official, consistent with subdivision d of subsection 4, that the proposed modification meets the criteria for use of minor permit modification procedures and a request that such procedures be used; and [4] Completed forms for the department to use to notify the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency and affected states as required under subsection 7. (c) United States environmental protection agency and affected state notification. Within five working days of receipt of a complete permit modification application, the department shall notify the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency and affected states of the requested permit modification. The department shall promptly send any notice required under paragraph 2 of subdivision b of subsection 7 to the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency. (d) Timetable for issuance. The department may not issue a final permit modification until after the United States environmental protection agency forty-five-day review period or until the United States environmental protection agency has notified the department that the United States environmental protection agency will not object to issuance of the permit modification, whichever is first, although the department can approve the permit modification prior to that time. Within ninety days of the department's receipt of an application under minor permit modification procedures or fifteen days after the end of the administrator's forty-five-day review period under subdivision c of subsection 7, whichever is later, the department shall: [1] Issue the permit modification as proposed; [2] Deny the permit modification application; 722 [3] Determine that the requested modification does not meet the minor permit modification criteria and should be reviewed under the significant modification procedures; or [4] Revise the draft permit modification and transmit to the administrator the new proposed permit modification as required by subdivision a of subsection 7. (e) Source's ability to make change. A source may make the change proposed in its minor permit modification application only after it files such application and the department approves the change in writing. If the department allows the source to make the proposed change prior to taking action specified in items 1, 2, and 3 of subparagraph d, the source must comply with both the applicable requirements governing the change and the proposed permit terms and conditions. During this time period, the source need not comply with the existing permit terms and conditions it seeks to modify. However, if the source fails to comply with its proposed permit terms and conditions during this time period, the existing permit terms and conditions it seeks to modify may be enforced against it. (f) The permit shield under subdivision f of subsection 5 shall not extend to minor permit modifications. (2) Group processing of minor permit modifications. Consistent with this paragraph, the department may modify the procedure outlined in paragraph 1 to process groups of a source's applications for certain modifications eligible for minor permit modification processing. (a) Criteria. Group processing of modifications may be used only for those permit modifications: [1] That meet the criteria for minor permit modification procedures under item 1 of subparagraph a of paragraph 1 of subdivision e; and [2] That collectively are below the threshold level which is ten percent of the emissions allowed by the permit for the emissions unit for which the change is requested, twenty percent of the applicable definition of major source in 723 subsection 1, or five tons [4.54 metric tons] per year, whichever is least. (b) Application. An application requesting the use of group processing procedures shall meet the requirements of subdivision c of subsection 4 and shall include the following: [1] A description of the change, the emissions resulting from the change, and any new applicable requirements that will apply if the change occurs. [2] The source's suggested draft permit. [3] Certification by a responsible official, consistent with subdivision d of subsection 4, that the proposed modification meets the criteria for use of group processing procedures and a request that such procedures be used. [4) A list of the source's other pending applications awaiting group processing, aild a determination of whether the requested modification, aggregated with these other applications, equals or exceeds the threshold set under item 2 of subparagraph a of paragraph 2 of subdivision e. [5) Certification, consistent with subdivision d of subsection 4, that the source has notified the United States environmental protection agency of the proposed modification. Such notification need only contain a brief description of the requested modification. [6] Completed forms for the department to use to notify the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency and affected states as required under subsection 7. (c) United States environmental protection agency and affected state notification. On a quarterly basis or within five business days of receipt of an application demonstrating that the aggregate of a source's pending applications equals or exceeds the threshold level set under item 2 of subparagraph a of paragraph 2 of subdivision e, whichever is earlier, the department shall meet its obligation under paragraph 1 of subdivision a of subsection 7 and paragraph 1 of subdivision b of 724 subsection 7 to notify the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency and affected states of the requested permit modifications. The department shall send any notice required under paragraph 2 of subdivision b of subsection 7 to the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency. (d) Timetable for issuance. The prov1s1ons of subparagraph d of paragraph 1 of subdivision e shall apply to modifications eligible for group processing, except that the department shall take one of the actions specified in items 1 through 4 of subparagraph d of paragraph 1 of subdivision e within one hundred eighty days of receipt of the application or fifteen days after the end of the administrator's forty-five-day review period under subdivision c of subsection 7, whichever is later. (e) Source's ability to make change. The provisions of subparagraph e of paragraph 1 apply to modifications eligible for group processing. (f) The permit shield under subdivision f of subsection 5 shall not extend to group processing of minor permit modifications. (3) Significant modification procedures. (a) Criteria. Significant modification procedures shall be used for applications requesting permit modifications that do not qualify as minor permit modifications or as administrative amendments. Every significant change in existing monitoring permit terms or conditions and every relaxation of reporting or recordkeeping permit terms or conditions shall be considered significant. Nothing herein shall be construed to preclude the permittee from making changes consistent with this subsection that would render existing permit compliance terms and conditions irrelevant. (b) Significant permit modifications shall meet all requirements of this section, including those for applications, public participation, review by affected states, and review by the United States environmental protection agency, as they apply to permit issuance and permit renewal. The department shall complete review of significant permit modifications within nine months after receipt of a complete application. 725 f. Heopening for cause. (1) Each issued permit shall include provisions specifying the conditions under which the permit will be reopened prior to the expiration of the permit. A permit shall be reopened and revised under any of the following circumstances: (a) Additional applicable requirements under the Federal Clean Air Act become applicable to a major title V source with a remaining permit term of three or more years. Such a reopening shall be completed not later than eighteen months after promulgation of the applicable requirement. No such reopening is required if the effective date of the requirement is later than the date on which the permit is due to expire, unless the original permit or any of its terms and conditions has been extended. (b) Additional requirements, including. excess emissions requirements, become applicable to an affected source under title IV of the Federal Clean Air Act or the regulations promulgated thereunder. Upon approval by the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency, excess emissions offset plans shall be deemed to be incorporated into the permit. (c) The department or the United States environmental protection agency determines that the permit contains a material mistake or that inaccurate statements were made in establishing the emissions standards or other terms or conditions of the permit. (d) The administrator of the United States environmental protection agency or the department determines that the permit must be revised or revoked to assure compliance with the applicable requirements. (2) Proceedings to reopen and issue a permit shall follow the same procedures as apply to initial permit issuance and shall affect only those parts of the permit for which cause to reopen exists. Such reopening shall be made as expeditiously as practicable. (3) Reopenings under paragraph 1 shall not be initiated before a notice of such intent is provided to the title V source by the department at least thirty days in advance of the date that the permit is to be reopened, except that the department may provide a shorter time period in the case of an emergency. 726 g. Reopenings for cause by the United States environmental protection agency. (1) If the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency finds that cause exists to terminate, modify, or revoke and reissue a permit pursuant to subdivision f, within ninety days after receipt of such notification, the department shall forward to the United States environmental protection agency a proposed determination of termination, modification, or revocation and reissuance, as appropriate. (2) The administrator of the United States environmental protection agency will review the proposed determination from the department within ninety days of receipt. (3) The department shall have ninety days from receipt of the United States environmental protection agency objection to resolve any objection that the United States environmental . protection agency makes and to terminate, modify, or revoke and reissue the permit in accordance with the administrator's objection. (4) If the department fails to submit a proposed determination or fails to resolve any objection, the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency will terminate, modify, or revoke and reissue the permit after taking the following actions: (a) Providing at least thirty days' notice to the permittee in writing of the reasons for any such action. (b) Providing the permittee an opportunity for comment on the administrator's proposed action and an opportunity for a hearing. h. Public participation. Except for modifications qualifying for minor permit modification procedures, all permit proceedings, including initial permit issuance, significant modifications, and renewals, shall be subject to procedures for public notice including offering an opportunity for public comment and a hearing on the draft permit. These procedures shall include the following: (1) Notice shall be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the source is located or in a state publication designed to give general public notice; to persons on a mailing list developed by the department, including those who request in writing to be on the list; and by other means if necessary to assure adequate notice to the affected public; 727 (2) The notice shall identify the affected facility; the name and address of the permittee; the name and address of the department; the activity or activities involved in the permit action; the emissions change involved in any permit modification; the name, address, and telephone number of a person from whom interested persons may obtain additional information, including copies of the permit draft, the application, all relevant supporting materials, and all other materials available to the department that are relevant to the permit decision; a brief description of the comment procedures required by this subsection; and the time and place of any hearing that may be held, including a statement of procedures to request a hearing, unless a hearing has already been scheduled; (3) The department shall provide such notice and opportunity for participation by affected states as is provided for by subsection 7; (4) The department shall provide at least thirty days for public comment and shall give notice of any public hearing at least thirty days in advance of the hearing; and (5) The department shall keep a record of the commenters and also of the issues raised during the public participation process. These records shall be available to the public. 7. Permit review by the United States environmental protection agency and affected states. a. Transmission of information to the administrator. (1) The department shall provide a copy of each permit application including any application for a permit modification (including the compliance plan), to the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency except that the applicant shall provide such information directly to the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency when directed to do so by the department. The department shall provide a copy of each proposed permit and each final title V permit to operate to the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency. To the extent practicable, the preceding information shall be provided in computer-readable format compatible with the United States environmental protection agency's national data base management system. (2) The department may waive the requirements of paragraph 1 and paragraph 1 of subdivision b for any category of sources 728 (including any class, type, or size within such category) other than major sources upon approval by the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency. (3) The department shall keep these records for at least five years. b. Review by affected states. (1) The department shall give notice of each draft permit to any affected state on or before the time that the notice to the public under subdivision h of subsection 6 is given, except to the extent paragraphs 1 and 2 of subdivision e of subsection 6 require the timing of the notice to be different. (2) As part of the submittal of the proposed permit to the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency (or as soon as possible after the submittal for minor permit modification procedures allowed under paragraphs 1 and 2 of subdivision e of subsection 6) the department shall notify the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency and any affected state in writing of any refusal by the department to accept all recommendations for the proposed permit that the affected state submitted during the public or affected state review period. The notice shall include the department's reasons for not accepting any such recommendation. The department is not required to accept recommendations that are not based on applicable requirements or the requirements of this section. c. United States environmental protection agency objection. No permit for which an application must be transmitted to the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency under subdivision a shall be issued if the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency objects to its issuance in writing within forty-five days of receipt of the proposed permit and all necessary supporting information. d. Public petitions to the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency. If the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency does not object in writing under subdivision c, any person may petition the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency within sixty days after the expiration of the administrator's forty-five-day review period to make such objection. Any such petition shall be based only on objections to the permit that were raised with reasonable specificity during the public comment period provided for in subdivision h of subsection 6, unless the petitioner demonstrates that it was impracticable to raise such objections within such 729 period, or unless the grounds for such objection arose after such period. If the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency objects to the permit as a result of a petition filed under this subdivision, the department shall not issue the permit until the United States environmental protection agency's objection has been resolved, except that a petition for review does not stay the effectiveness of a permit or its requirements if the permit was issued after the end of the forty-five-day review period and prior to the United States environmental protection agency's objection. If the department has issued a permit prior to receipt of the United States environmental protection agency's objection under this subdivision, the department may thereafter issue only a revised permit that satisfies the United States environmental protection agency's objection. In any case, the source will not be in violation of the requirement to have submitted a timely and complete application. e. Prohibition on default issuance. The department shall issue no title V permit to operate, including a permit renewal or modification, until affected states and the United States environmental protection agency have had an opportunity to review the proposed permit as required under this subsection. 8. Judicial review of title V permit to operate decisions. a. The applicant, any person who participated in the department's public participation process, and any other person who could obtain judicial review under North Dakota Century Code section .28-32-15 may obtain judicial review provided such appeal is filed in accordance with North Dakota Century Code section 28-32-15 within thirty days after notice of the final permit action. b. The department's failure to take final action on an application for a permit, permit renewal, or permit revision within the timeframes referenced in this section shall be appealable in accordance with North Dakota Century Code section 28-32-15 within thirty days after expiration of the applicable timeframes. c. In accordance with North Dakota Century Code chapter 28-32, the mechanisms outlined in this subsection shall be the exclusive means for judicial review of permit decisions referenced in this section. d. Solely for the purpose of obtaining judicial review in state court, \u00b7final permit action shall include the failure of the department to take \u00b7final action on an application for a permit, permit renewal, or permit revision within the timeframes referenced in this section. 730 e. Failure to take final action within ninety days of receipt of an application requesting minor permit modification procedures (or one hundred eighty days for modifications subject to group processing requirements) shall be considered final action and subject to judicial review in state court. 9. Enforcement. The department may suspend, revoke, or terminate a permit for violations of this article, violation of any permit condition or for failure to respond to a notice of violation or any order issued pursuant to this article. A permit to operate which has been revoked or terminated pursuant to this article must be surrendered forthwith to the department. No person may operate or cause the operation of a source if the department denies, terminates, revokes, or suspends a permit to operate. 10. Compliance assurance monitoring. Except as noted below, title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, part 64 compliance assurance monitoring, as ~ublist:led iR the federal register eR October 22, 1997, as it exists on January 31. 2002. is incorporated by reference. a. \"Administrator'' means the department except for those duties that cannot be delegated by the United States environmental protection agency. For those duties that cannot be delegated, administrator means the department and the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency. b. \"Part 70 permit\" means a title V permit to operate. c. \"Permitting authority\" means the department. History: Effective March 1, 1994; amended effective December 1, 1994; August 1, 1995; January 1, 1996; September 1, 1997; September 1, For the purposes of this chapter: a. \"Actual emissions\" means the actual rate of em1ss1ons of a contaminant from an emissions unit, as determined in accordance with paragraphs 1 through 4. (1) In general, actual emissions as of a particular date must equal the average rate, in tons per year, at which the unit actually emitted the contaminant during a two-year period which precedes the particular date and which is representative of normal source operation. The department may allow the use of a different time period upon a determination that it is more representative of normal source operation. Actual emissions must be calculated using the unit's actual operating hours, production rates, and types of materials. processed, stored, or combusted during the selected time period. (2) The department may presume that source-specific allowable emissions for the unit are equivalent to the actual emissions of the unit. (3) For any emissions unit (other than an electric utility steam generating unit specified in paragraph 4) which has not begun normal operations on the particular date, actual emissions shall equal the potential to emit of the unit on that date. (4) For an electric utility steam generating unit (other than a new unit or the replacement of an existing unit) actual emissions of the unit following the physical or operational change shall equal the representative actual annual emissions of the unit following the physical or operational change, provided the source owner or operator maintains and submits to the reviewing authority, on an annual basis for a period of five years from the date the unit resumes regular operation, information demonstrating that the physical or operational change did not result in an emissions increase.

In no event may application of \"best available control technology\" result in emissions of any contaminant which would exceed the emissions allowed by any applicable standards of performance under chapters 33-15-12 and 33-15-13. If the department determines that technological or economic limitations on the application of measurement methodology to a particular emissions unit would make the imposition of an emission standard infeasible, a design, equipment, work practice or operational standard, or combination thereof, may be prescribed instead to satisfy the requirement for the application of best available control technology. Such standard must, to the degree possible, set forth the emissions reduction achievable by implementation of such design, equipment, work practice, or operation, and shall provide for compliance by means which achieve equivalent results. h. \"Clean coal technology\" means any technology, including technologies applied at the precombustion, combustion, or postcombustion stage, at a new or existing facility which will achieve significant reductions in air emissions of sulfur dioxide or oxides of nitrogen associated with the utilization of coal in the generation of electricity, or process steam which was not in widespread use as of November 15, 1990. i. \"Clean coal technology demonstration project\" means a project using funds appropriated under the heading \"department of energy-clean coal technology\", up to a total amount of two billion 735 five hundred million dollars for commercial demonstration of clean coal technology, or similar projects funded through appropriations for the United States environmental protection agency.

Instead, the requirements of subdivisions c and h as in effect prior to May 7, 1981, apply to any such source or modification. (5) The requirements for air quality monitoring in subparagraphs b, c, and d of paragraph 1 of subdivision g do not apply to: (a) A particular source or modification that was subject to this chapter as in effect prior to May 7, 1981, if the owner or operator of the source or modification submitted an application for a permit under this chapter on or before June 8, 1981, and the department subsequently determined that the application as submitted before that date was complete with respect to the requirements of this chapter other than those in subparagraphs b, c, and d of paragraph 1 of subdivision g and with respect to the requirements for such analyses in paragraph 2 of subdivision gas in effect prior to May 7, 1981. Instead, the requirements of this chapter prior to May 7, 1981, shall apply to any source or modification. (b) A particular source or modification that was not subject to this chapter as in effect prior to May 7, 1981 , if the owner or operator of the source or modification submitted an application for a permit under this chapter on or before June 8, 1981, and the department subsequently determined that the application as submitted before that date was complete, except with respect to the requirements in subparagraphs b, c, and d of paragraph 1 of subdivision g. 752 (6) The requirements of subdivisions c, e, f, g, h, i, and j and subsections 5 and 6 in their entirety do not apply to a particular major stationary source or major modification, if: (a) The source or modification would be a major stationary source or major modification only if fugitive emissions, to the extent quantifiable, are considered in calculating the potential to emit of the stationary source or modification and the source does not belong to any of the stationary sources of air contaminants listed in subdivision u of subsection 1 and any other stationary source category which, as of August 7, 1980, is being regulated under section 111 or 112 of the Federal Clean Air Act [Pub. L. 95-95]. (b) The source is a portable stationary source which has previously received a permit under this chapter and: [1] The owner or operator proposes to relocate the source and emissions of the source at the new location would be temporary. [2] The emissions from the source would not exceed its allowable emissions. [3] The emissions from the source would impact no class I area and no area where an applicable increment is known to be violated. [4] Reasonable notice is given to the department prior to the relocation identifying the proposed new location and the probable duration of operation at the new location. Such notice shall be given to the department not less than ten days in advance of the proposed relocation unless a different time duration is previously approved by the department. (c) With respect to a particular air contaminant, the owner or operator demonstrates that the source or modification is located in an area designated as nonattainment by the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency, as to that air contaminant, under this article. (d) The source or modification would be a nonprofit health or nonprofit educational institution, or a major modification would occur at such an institution, and 753 the governor requests that it be exempt from such requirements. e. Source impact analysis. The owner or operator of the proposed source or modification shall demonstrate that allowable emission increases from the source or modification, in conjunction with all other applicable emissions increases or reductions (including secondary emissions) from any other sources, will not cause or contribute to air pollution in violation of: (1) Any ambient air quality standard in any area; or (2) Any applicable maximum allowable increase over the baseline concentration in any area. f. Air quality models. (1) All estimates of ambient concentrations required under this section must be based on the applicable air quality models, data bases, and other requirements specified in the \"Guidelines on Air Quality Models\" (United States environmental protection agency, office of air quality planning and standards, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711) as supplemented by the \"North Dakota Guideline for Air Quality Modeling Analyses\" (North Dakota state department of health, division of environmental engineering). These documents are incorporated by reference. (2) When an air quality impact model specified in the documents incorporated by reference in paragraph 1 is inappropriate, the model may be modified or another model substituted provided: (a) Any modified or nonguideline model must be subjected to notice and opportunity for public comment under subsection 5. (b) The applicant must provide to the department adequate information to evaluate the applicability of the modified or nonguideline model. Such information must include methods like those outlined in the \"Workbook for the Comparison of Air Quality Models\" (United States environmental protection agency, office of air quality planning and standards, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711 ). (c) Written approval from the department must be obtained for any modification or substitution prior 754 to an application being designated complete by the department. (d) Written approval from the United States environmental protection agency must be obtained for any modification or substitution prior to the granting of a permit under this chapter. g. Air quality analysis. (1) Preapplication analysis. (a) Any application for a permit under this section must contain an analysis of ambient air quality in the area that the major stationary source or major modification would affect for each of the following air contaminants: [1] For the source, each air contaminant that it would have the potential to emit in a significant amount; and [2] For the modification, each air contaminant for which it would result in a significant net emissions increase. (b) With respect to any such air contaminant for which no ambient air quality standard exists, the analysis must contain such air quality monitoring data as the department determines is necessary to assess ambient air quality for that air contaminant in any area that the emissions of that air contaminant would affect. (c) With respect to any such air contaminant (other than nonmethane hydrocarbons) for which such a standard does exist, the analysis must contain continuous air quality monitoring data gathered for purposes of determining whether emissions of that air contaminant would cause or contribute to a violation of the standard or any maximum allowable increase. (d) In general, the continuous air quality monitoring data that are required shall have been gathered over a period of at least one year and shall represent at least the year preceding receipt of the application except that if the department determines that a complete and adequate analysis can be accomplished with monitoring data gathered over a period shorter than one year (but not to be less than four months}, the 755 data that are required shall have been gathered over at least that shorter period. (e) For any application which becomes complete, except as to the requirements of subparagraphs c and d, between June 8, 1981, and February 9, 1982, the data that subparagraph c requires shall have been gathered over at least the period from February 9, 1981 , to the date the application becomes otherwise complete, except that: [1] If the source or modification would have been major for that air contaminant under this chapter as in effect prior to May 7, 1981 , any monitoring data shall have been gathered over at least the period required by those rules. [2] If the department determines that a complete and adequate analysis can be accomplished with monitoring data over \u00b7 a shorter period (not to be less than four months), the data that subparagraph c requires shall have been gathered over at least that shorter period. [3] If the monitoring data would relate exclusively to ozone and would not have been required under this chapter as in effect prior to May 7, 1981, the department may waive the otherwise applicable requirements of this subparagraph to the extent that the applicant shows that the monitoring data would be unrepresentative of air quality over a full year. (f) The owner or operator of a proposed stationary source or modification of volatile organic compounds who satisfies all conditions of 40 CFR, part 51, appendix S, section IV may provide postapproved monitoring data for ozone in lieu of providing preconstruction data as required under paragraph 1. (2) Postconstruction monitoring. The owner or operator of a major stationary source or major modification shall, after construction of the stationary source or modification, conduct such ambient monitoring as the department determines is necessary to determine the effect emissions from the stationary source or modification may have, or are having, on air quality in any area. 756 (3) Operations of monitoring stations. The owner or operator of a major stationary source or major modification shall meet the requirements of 40 CFR, part 58, appendix B during the operation of monitoring stations for purposes of satisfying subdivision g. h. Source information. The owner or operator of a proposed major stationary source or major modification shall submit all information necessary to perform any analysis to make any determination required under this article. Such information must include: (1) A description of the nature, location, design capacity, and typical operating schedule of the proposed source or modification, including specifications and drawings showing the design and plant layout. (2) A detailed schedule for construction of the source or modification. (3) A detailed description as\u00b7 to what system of continuous emission reduction is planned by the source or modification, emission estimates, and any other information necessary to determine that best available control technology as s~eeified iA the by refereAee. (4) The air quality impact of the source or modification, including meteorological and topographical data necessary to estimate such impact. (5) Information on the air quality impacts and the nature and extent of general commercial, residential, industrial, and other growth which has occurred since the baseline date in the area the source or modification would affect. i. Additional impact analyses. (1) The owner or operator shall provide an analysis of the impairment to visibility, (in accordance with chapter 33-15-19) soils and vegetation, and wildlife that would occur as a result of the source or modification and general commercial, residential, industrial, and other growth associated with the source or modification. The owner or operator need not provide an analysis on vegetation or wildlife having no significant commercial or recreational value except for endangered and threatened species as identified by the United States fish and wildlife service. 757 (2) The owner or operator shall provide an analysis of the air quality impact projected for the area as a result of the general commercial, residential, industrial, and other growth associated with the source or modification. j. Sources impacting federal class I areas-additional requirements. (1) Notice to the United States environmental protection agency. The department shall transmit to the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency through the region VIII regional administrator a copy of each permit application relating to a major stationary source or major modification received by the department and provide notice to the administrator of every action related to the consideration of such permit. (2) Notice to federal land managers. The department shall provide written notice of . any permit application for a proposed major stationary source or major modification, the emissions from which may affect a Class I area, to the federal land manager and the federal official charged with direct responsibility for management of any lands within any such area. Such notification must include a copy of all information relevant to the permit application and must be given within thirty days of receipt and at least sixty days prior to any public hearing on the application for a permit to construct. Such notification must include an analysis of the proposed source's anticipated impacts on visibility in the federal class I area. The department shall also provide the federal land manager and such federal officials with a copy of the preliminary determination required under subsection 5 and shall make available to them any materials used in making that determination, promptly after the department makes such determination. Finally, the department shall also notify all affected federal land managers within thirty days of receipt of any advance notification of any such permit application. (3) Denial -impact on air quality-related values. A federal land manager may present to the department, after reviewing the department's preliminary determination required under subsection 5, a demonstration that the emission from an applicable source will have an adverse impact on the air quality-related values (including visibility) of federal mandatory class I lands, notwithstanding that the change in air quality resulting from emissions from such source or modification will not cause or contribute to concentrations which exceed the maximum allowable increases for a class I 758 area. If the department concurs with such demonstration, the permit may not be issued. (4) Class I variances. (a) The owner or operator of a proposed source may demonstrate to the federal land manager that the emissions from such source or modification will have no adverse impact on the air quality-related values of any such lands (including visibility), notwithstanding that the change in air quality resulting from emissions from such source or modification will cause or contribute to concentrations which exceed the maximum allowable increases for a class I area. If the federal land manager concurs with such demonstration and the manager so certifies to the department, the department may issue the permit pursuant to the requirements of subparagraph b; provided, that the applicable requirements of this chapter are otherwise met. (b) In the case of a permit issued pursuant to subparagraph a, such source or modification shall comply with such emission limitations under such permit as may be necessary to assure that emissions of sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and nitrogen oxides will not exceed the following maximum allowable increases over the minor source baseline concentration for such contaminants: Maximum allowable increase (micrograms per cubic meter) Particulate matter: PM10, Annual arithmetic maximum 3-hour maximum Nitrogen dioxide: Annual arithmetic mean 17 30 20 91 325 25 (5) Sulfur dioxide variance by governor with federal land manager's concurrence. The owner or operator of a proposed source or modification which cannot be approved 759 under paragraph 4 may demonstrate to the governor, that the source or modification cannot be constructed by reason of any maximum allowable increase for sulfur dioxide for periods of twenty-four hours or less applicable to any class I area and, in the case of federal mandatory class I areas, that a variance under this clause would not adversely affect the air quality-related values of the area, including visibility. The governor, after consideration of the federal land manager's recommendation, if any, and subject to the federal land manager's concurrence, may, after notice and public hearing, grant a variance from such maximum allowable increase. If such variance is granted, the department shall issue a permit to such source or modification pursuant to the requirements of paragraph 7; provided, that the applicable requirements of this chapter are otherwise met. (6) Variance by the governor with the president's concurrence. If the governor recommends a variance under this subdivision in which the federal land manager does not concur, the recommendations of the governor and the federal land manager must be transmitted to the president. The president may approve the governor's recommendation if the president finds that such variance is in the national interest. If such a variance is approved, the department shall issue a permit pursuant to the requirements of paragraph 7; provided, that the applicable requirements of this chapter are otherwise met. (7) Emission limitations for presidential or gubernatorial variances. In the case of a permit issued pursuant to paragraph 5 or 6, the source or modification shall comply with emission limitations under such permit as may be necessary to assure that emissions of sulfur dioxide from such source or modification, during any day on which the otherwise applicable maximum allowable increases are exceeded, will not cause or contribute to concentrations which exceed the following maximum allowable increases over the baseline concentration and to assure that such emissions will not cause or otherwise contribute to concentrations which exceed the otherwise applicable maximum allowable increases for periods of exposure of twenty-four hours or less for more than eighteen days, not necessarily consecutive, during any annual period: Maximum allowable increase (micrograms per cubic meter) Period of expe>sure 24-hour maximum 3-hour maximum Low terrain areas 36 130 760 High terrain areas 62 221 k. Proposed redesignations. If an owner or operator applies for permission to construct pursuant to this chapter and the proposed source or modification would impact on an area which has previously been proposed for redesignation to a more stringent class by the department, an Indian governing body, or another state, or the state or Indian governing body has announced such consideration, approval may not be granted until the proposed redesignation has been acted upon. However, approval must be granted if, in the department's judgment, the proposed source would not violate the increments that would be applicable if the redesignation is approved. The department shall withhold approval under this subdivision only so long as another state or Indian governing body is actively and expeditiously proceeding toward redesignation. If an owner or operator has applied for permission to construct pursuant to this chapter and whose application has been deemed complete by the department prior to the public announcement of a proposed redesignation of an area to a more stringent class and if such facility would impact on the area proposed for redesignation, the application shall be processed considering the classification of the area which existed at the time the application was deemed complete. 5. Public participation. a. Within thirty days after receipt of an application to construct a source or modification subject to this chapter, or any addition to such application, the department shall advise the applicant as to the completeness of the application or of any deficiency in the application or information submitted. In the event of such a deficiency, the date of receipt of the application, for the purpose of this chapter, shall be the date on which all required information to form a complete application is received by the department. b. Within one year after receipt of a completed application, the department shall: (1) Make a preliminary determination whether the source should be approved, approved with conditions; or disapproved pursuant to the requirements of this chapter. (2) Make available in at least one location in each region in which the proposed source or modification would be constructed, a copy of all materials submitted by the applicant, a copy of the department's preliminary determination, and a copy or summary of other materials, if any, considered by the department in making a preliminary determination. 761 (3) Notify the public, by prominent advertisement in newspapers of general circulation in each region in which the proposed source or modification would be constructed, of the application, the preliminary determination, the degree of increment consumption that is expected from the source or modification, and the opportunity for comment at a public hearing as well as written public comment on the information submitted by the owner or operator and the department's preliminary determination on the approvability of the source. (4) Send a copy of the notice required in paragraph 3 to the applicant, the United States environmental protection agency administrator, and to officials and agencies having cognizance over the locations where the source or modification will be situated as follows: local air pollution control agencies, the chief executive of the city and county where the source or modification would be located; any comprehensive regional land use planning agency; and any state, federal land manager, or Indian governing body whose lands may be significantly affected by emissions from the source or modification. (5) Hold a public hearing whenever, on the basis of written requests, a significant degree of public interest exists or at its discretion when issues involved in the permit decision need to be clarified. A public hearing would be held during the public comment period for interested persons, including representatives of the United States environmental protection agency administrator, to appear and submit written or oral comments on the air quality impact of the source or modification, alternatives to the source or modification, the control technology required, and other appropriate considerations. (6) Consider all public comments submitted in writing within a time specified in the public notice required in paragraph 3 and all comments received at any public hearing conducted pursuant to paragraph 5 in making its final decision on the approvability of the application. No later than ten days after the close of the public comment period, the applicant may submit a written response to any comments submitted by the public. The department shall consider the applicant's response in making its final decision. All comments must be made available for public inspection in the same locations where the department made available preconstruction information relating to the source or modification. 762 (7) Make a final determination whether the source should be approved, approved with conditions, or disapproved pursuant to the requirements of this chapter. (8) Notify the applicant in writing of the department's final determination. The notification must be made available for public inspection in the same locations where the department made available preconstruction information and public comments relating to the source or modification. 6. Source obligation. a. Any owner or operator who constructs or operates a stationary source or modification not in accordance with the application, submitted pursuant to subsection 4 or with the terms of any permit to construct; or any owner or operator of a stationary source or modification subject to this chapter who commences construction after the effective date of this chapter without applying for and receiving a permit to construct hereunder, shall be subject to enforcement action under North Dakota Century Code section 23-25-10. b. A permit to construct shall become invalid if construction is not commenced within eighteen months after receipt of such permit, if construction is discontinued for a period of eighteen months or more, or if construction is not completed within a reasonable time. The department may extend the eighteen-month period upon a satisfactory showing that an extension is justified. This provision does not apply to the time period between construction of the approved phases of a phased construction project; each phase must commence construction within eighteen months of the projected and approved commencement date. In cases of major construction projects involving long lead times and substantial financial commitments, the department may provide by a condition to the permit a time period greater than eighteen months when such time extension is supported by sufficient documentation by the applicant. c. A permit to construct does not relieve any owner or operator of the responsibility to comply fully with the applicable provisions of the state implementation plan and any other requirements under local, state, or federal law. d. At such time that a particular source or modification becomes a major stationary source or modification solely by virtue of a relaxation in any enforceable limit which was established after May 7, 1980, on the capacity of the source or modification otherwise to emit an air contaminant, such as a restriction on hours of operation, then the requirements of subdivisions c, 763 e, f, g, h, i, and j and the requirements of this subsection and subsections 5 and 7 shall apply to the source or modification as though construction had not yet commenced on the source or modification. 7. lnnctvative control technology. a. An owner or operator of a proposed major stationary source or major modification may request the department in writing to approve a system of innovative control technology. b. The department shall, with the consent of the governors of all affected states, determine that the source or modification may employ a system of innovative control technology, if: (1) The proposed control system would not cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety in its operation or function. (2) The owner or operator agrees to achieve a level of continuous emissions reduction equivalent to that which would have been required under paragraph 2 of subdivision c of subsection 4 by a date specified by the department. Such date may not be later than four years from the time of startup or seven years from permit issuance. (3) The source or modification would meet the requirements of subdivisions c and e of subsection 4 based on the emissions rate that the stationary source employing the system of innovative control technology would be required to meet on the date specified by the department. (4) The source or modification would not before the date specified by the department: (a) Cause or contribute to a violation of an applicable ambient air quality standard; or (b) Impact any area where an applicable increment is known to be violated. (5) The provisions of subdivision j of subsection 4, relating to class I areas, have been satisfied with respect to all periods during the life of the source or modification. (6) All other applicable requirements including those for public participation have been met. 764 c. The department shall withdraw any approval to employ a system of innovative control technology made under this section, if: (1) The proposed system fails by the specified date to achieve the required continuous emissions reduction rate; (2) The proposed system fails before the specified date so as to contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety; or (3) The department decides at any time that the proposed system is unlikely to achieve the required level of control or to protect the public health, welfare, or safety. d. If a source or modification fails to meet the required level of continuous emission reduction within the specified time period or the approval is withdrawn in accordance with subdivision c, the department may allow the source or modification up to an additional three years to meet the requirement for the application of best available control technology through use of a demonstrated system of control.

If the creditor adds identifiable insurance charges or premiums for consumer credit insurance to the debt. and any direct or indirect finance. carrying. credit. or service charge is made to the debtor on the insurance charges or premiums. the creditor must remit and the insurer shall collect the premium within sixty days after it is added to the debt. 3. Refinancing of the debt. If the debt is discharged due to refinancing prior to the scheduled maturity date. the insurance in force shall be terminated before any new insurance may be issued in connection with the refinanced debt. In all cases of termination prior to scheduled maturity. a refund of all unearned premium or unearned insurance charges paid by the debtor shall be paid or credited to the debtor as provided in section 45-07-01.1-08. In any refinancing of the debt. the effective date of the coverage as respects any policy provision shall be deemed to be the first date on which the debtor became insured under the policy with respect to the debt which was refinanced. at least to extent of the amount and term of the debt outstanding at the time of refinancing of the debt. 4. Maximum aggregate provisions. A provision in an individual policy or group certificate which sets a maximum limit on total claim payments must apply only to that individual policy or group certificate. 5. Prepayment of debt.

However. if the prepayment is a result of death or any other lump sum consumer credit insurance payment. no refund shall be reguired for the coverage under which the lump sum was paid. If a claim under credit accident and health coverage or credit unemployment coverage is in progress at the time of prepayment. the 775 amount of refund may be determined as if the prepayment did not occur until the payment of benefits terminates. No refund need be paid during any period of disability for which credit accident and health bene~fits are payable or during any period of unemployment for which credit unemployment benefits are payable. A refund shall be computed as if prepayment occurred at the end of the disability period or at the end of the unemployment period.

If the coverage provided is a combination of a constant maximum indemnity for a given period of time after which the maximum indemnity begins to decrease in even amounts per month. an appropriate combination of the premium rate for a constant maximum indemnity for a given period of time and the premium rate for a maximum indemnity which decreases in even amounts per month shall be used. e. The outstanding balance rate for credit accident and health insurance may be either a term-specified rate or may be a single composite term outstanding balance rate. 2. fu!b.iect to the conditions and requirements in subsection 5 and section 45-07-01.1-10. the prima facie rates for credit accident and health insurance shown below are considered to meet the requirements of section 45-07-01.1-03 in the situation where the insurance is written on an c1pen-end loan. These prima facie rates and the formulae used to calculate them may be used without filing additional actuarial support. Othc:~r formulae to convert from a closed-end credit rate to an open-end creel it rate may be used if approved by the commissioner. a. If the maximum benefit of the insurance equals the net debt on the date of disability. the term of the Joan is calculated according to the formula: 1/(minimum payment percent). The prima facie rate is determined by applying the calculated term to the rates shown in subsection 1. A composite minimum payment percentage may be used in place of the minimum payment percentage for a specific credit transaction. b. If the maximum benefit of the insurance equals the outstanding balance of the loan on the date of disability plus any interest accruing on that amount during disability. the term of the insurance (n) is estimated by using the following formula: 780 n = 1 n{1-(1 OOOi/x)}/1 n(v) where: i = interest rate on the account or a composite interest rate used for the type of policy: x = monthly payment per one thousand dollars of coverage consistent with the term calculated above: and v = 1/(1 + i). The calculated value of the term is used to look up an initial rate in subsection 1. The final prima facie rate is calculated by multiplying the initial rate by: . the adjustment n/an \u00b7 where: n is the term calculated above: and n Sr,=(1-v)li. 3. If the accident and health coverage is sold on a joint basis involving two people. the factor for calculating the rate is 1.8. 4. If the benefits provided are other than those described in subsection 1 or 2. rates for those benefits shall be actuarially consistent with rates provided in subsections 1 and 2. 5. The premium rates in subsection 1 shall apply to contracts providing credit accident and health insurance and that contain the provisions below: a. Coverage may be excluded for disabilities resulting from: ill Normal pregnancy: @ War or any act of war: !ID Elective surgery: ~ Intentionally self-inflicted injury: 781 @.

For the preexisting condition exclusion above. the effective date of coverage for that part of the insurance attributable to a different advance or a charge to the plan account may be the date on which the advance or charge occurs. c. A definition of disability providing that for the first twelve months of disability. total disability shall be defined as the inability to perform the essential functions ofthe insured's own occupation. Thereafter. it shall mean the inability of the insured to perform the essential functions of any occupation for which the insured is reasonably suited by virtue of education. training, or experience. d.
