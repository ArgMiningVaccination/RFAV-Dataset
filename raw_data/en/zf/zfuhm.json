Together, we worked to change that and pursue intergenerational wealth and benefit for our Peoples and Nations. As a First Nations-, sovereign- and traditional territory-owned and led coalition, Natural Law has solid relationships and a demonstrated capacity to negotiate groundbreaking transactions between public and private sector investment, governments and Nations, and Indigenous and non-Indigenous organizations. Using our ceremonies, our ancestors' teachings, and our natural laws, we have helped our Nations forge historical moments of economic reconciliation. In our next chapter, we will continue to build on these capacities to imagine new futures for our people. While we will continue to work with Nations to ensure they are equitable and empowered participants in Global resource economy, we are broadening our view to see what new opportunities are possible as we move forward. No matter the projects we work on with our Nations, together, we will continue to prioritize the strength of our in heritage rights and sovereignty, our independence, our cultures and traditions and our environmental stewardship. Our message is resonating, and we are building momentum. We are stronger together. Natural Law x Global is an Indigenous-owned company born as a coalition of First Nations in Western Turtle Island. We acknowledge and honour all the Treaty and unceded lands of First Nations and Original Peoples across Turtle Island. The acknowledgement of the land is a traditional custom of Indigenous peoples spanning generations. We are grateful for the Knowledge Keepers, Elders and caretakers of this land of the past, present, and the future. These are our lands and our resources. Never forget the stories of Turtle Island; they are still yours. "}
