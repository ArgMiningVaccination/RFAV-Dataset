McCann, MD, have no financial arrangements or affiliations with any commercial entities whose products, research or services may be discussed in these materials. Kelly K. McCann, MDKelly K. McCann, MDObjectives Discuss how chronic infections such as Lyme Disease and Co - infections lead to oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and immune system dysfunction which manifests in physical and mental health symptoms. Review the Multiple Systemic Infectious Disease Syndrome (MSIDS) and the use of the questionnaire for suspected Lyme disease. Discuss the Cell Danger Response and its impact in chronic infections. Comprehensive treatment strategies addressing environmental exposures such as mold and toxicants. Utilizing case presentations to highlight teaching points. Kelly K. McCann, MDLyme Disease (interchangeable with Lyme): refers to the infection that includes not only B. burgdorferi but many co -infections. Lyme Borreliosis : Solo infection with B. burgdorferi . Persistent Lyme Disease : A patient with persistent and chronic Lyme disease has Borrelia infection and likely other infections, as well as; immune dysfunction, inflammation, opportunistic infections, deficient biological terrain, metabolic and hormonal imbalances, deconditioning, biotoxin illness or chronic inflammatory response syndrome (CIRS) or environmental toxicant burden, etc. that need to be addressed in order to bring the patient to wellness.

McCann, MD Kelly K. McCann, MD Kelly K. McCann, MDKelly K. McCann, MDInflammatory disease processes appear to be due to alterations in the microbiome. Autoimmune diseases may be antibody generation against polymicrobial colonies and infections. Intracellular microbes slow innate immune system defense by dysregulating the vitamin D nuclear receptor (VDR). VDR affects transcription of at least 913 gene including the expression of key antimicrobial peptides. This dysregulation facilitates the ability of other pathogens to persist and slow the immune system further. VDR dysregulation prevents the breakdown of the active VitD metabolite 1,25oh, thus it becomes elevated and 25 -OH vitD remains low. Elevated 1,25OH -D can interfere with the expression of other nuclear receptors such as the androgen receptor, glucocorticoid receptor and thyroid receptors. Vitamin D discrepancy Proal. 2009.

Activation of Inflammation and host immune responses cause damage leading to hallmarks of neurodegeneration. Misfolded proteins, oxidative stress, deficient apoptosis, cell death. Dexamethasone reverses inflammatory cascade, both lower inflammatory markers and preventing pathological changes in animal neuroborreliosis . Lyme K. McCann, MDWhen mitochondria nutrients and substrates are perturbed by viral or microbial infection or toxins, there is a metabolic mismatch. Electrons are diverted, oxygen consumption falls, assembly of DNA, RNA, lipids, proteins and carb synthesis stops. ROS/RNS rise and there is a limit to the replication of the invading pathogen. Oxidative changes are the symptoms of the disease, not the cause. Oxidative shielding rather than oxidative stress Naviaux. Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics. 2012, 342(3):608 -18.Kelly K. McCann, MDThe danger response (CDR) is an evolutionarily conserved cellular metabolic response that is activated when a cell encounters a chemical, physical, or microbial threat that could injure or kill the cell. Psychological trauma, particularly during childhood, can also activate the cell danger response, produce chronic inflammation, and increase the risk of many disorders.The Cell Danger Response Naviaux. Mitochondrion. 2014. 16:7 -17Kelly K. McCann, MDThe acute CDR produces at least 8 functional changes: 1) It shifts cellular metabolism to prevent the hijacking and assembly of cellular resources by intracellular pathogens. 2) It stiffens the membranes of the cell 3) Releases antiviral and antimicrobial chemicals into the pericellular environment 4) Increases autophagy and mitochondrial fission to remove intracellular pathogensThe Cell K. McCann, MD5) Changes DNA methylation and histone modification to alter gene expression 6) Mobilizes endogenous retroviruses and other mobile genetic elements like the long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) to produce genetic variations 7) Warns neighboring cells and distant effector cells of the danger 8) Alters the behavior of the host to prevent the spread of infection to kin and sleep patterns to facilitate healing The Cell Danger ResponseKelly K. McCann, MD Metabolomics of chronic fatigue indicate a hypometabolic state in response to pathologically persist or recurrent cell danger signaling, as in the case of persistent viral or bacterial infections. Dauer, which means persistent or long - lived in German, is a hypometabolic state capable of living efficiently by altering basic mitochondrial functions to confer a survival advantage .

McCann, MD Most infectious agents can induce autoimmunity disease in genetic susceptible hosts, which in turn increases their risks of additional infections. Post -infectious autoimmunity can be induced by a variety of mechanisms including molecular mimicry, bystander activation, persistent infections and polyclonal activation. Burden of infections are cumulative over lifetime to a breakthrough point. Kivity , et al. 2009Kelly K. McCann, MDTen principles of the relationship between infection and autoimmunity 1. Infections can cause autoimmune diseases. 2. Different infectious agents (viruses, bacteria, fungus and parasites) can trigger autoimmunity. 3. An infection can trigger an individual with an underlying immune dysregulation to express an overt autoimmune disease. 4. Infectious agents can determine the presence of disease -specific auto - antibodies and clinical manifestations. 5. In many cases, it is not a single infection, but rather the 'burden of infections' during life that is responsible for induction of autoimmunity.Kelly K. McCann, MDTen principles of the relationship between infection and autoimmunity 6. Infections during childhood can be implicated in the development of autoimmune diseases in adulthood. 7. Infections can protect individuals from some autoimmune diseases. 8. The same infectious agent can induce one specific autoimmune disease and protect from another autoimmune disease. 9. Molecular mimicry, epitope spreading, bystander activation and polyclonal activation can induce autoimmunity after infections via innate and adaptive immune responses. 10. Genetic susceptibility might explain why only a subgroup of individuals will develop autoimmunity after infections.Kelly K.

These metabolic abnormalities could underlie several associations to ASD such as sleep and GI disorders. Gevi , 2016Kelly K.

Biofilms 6. Immune evasion and persistent infections 7. Various Treatment GuidelinesKelly K. McCann, MD The guidelines address 3 treatment questions: 1.Usefulness of antibiotics for known tick bites. 2.The effectiveness of erythema migrains (EM) treatment. 3.The role of antibiotic treatment in patients with persistent manifestation of Lyme disease. With regard to the 3rdquestion, reassess diagnosis, screen for co -infections, evaluate for other causes, and start with 4 -6 weeks of antibiotics if so agreed. Extensive treatment options exist. Consider previous responsiveness, progression of illness, patient impairments. Kelly K.

McCann, MD Kelly K. McCann, MDHow to manage a patient whom you suspect has Lyme disease Patients often need a team approach to their care. Locate and meet with Lyme literate practitioners in your area. Check out www.ILADS.org or your state or local Lyme advocacy groups for referrals. Begin the work up, if comfortable. If not, refer. You may also need functional and integrative medicine practitioners with whom to partner, if you can't find a Lyme literate, functional practitioner. Know that these patients have often been neglected and dismissed by the medical system. They need your support and acknowledgment that you believe them, even if you can't explain all their symptoms. If the psychological and emotional and even spiritual aspects don't get addressed, they will continue to struggle. Metaphor of immune system -boundary issues Kelly K. McCann, MD Kelly K.
