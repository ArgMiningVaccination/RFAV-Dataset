Chen went to China Medical University Hospital for a colonoscopy. She was found to have a tumor 6 cm in size in her colon. Considering the severe side effects induced by surgery and the fact that no invasive cancer was identified by endoscopy or biopsy, she was referred to the OPD of Dr. An-Ti Chang at the Gastroenterology Department for an endoscopic mucosal resection of the tumor. This endoscopic surgery went smoothly and the patient was able to eat six hours post-surgery with a good recovery. As she opted for non-invasive surgery there is no wound on the skin. She arranged a follow-up colonoscopy three months after the surgery and she had recovered well without any residual or recurrent tumor cells identified by biopsy. Mdm. Chen said that she will take the fecal occult blood screening test provided by the government. The screening result in 2019 was positive but it was confirmed to be hemorrhoids. By 2020, she had undergone the colonoscopy in CMUH and found to have a tumor 6 cm in size and had endoscopic mucosal resection of the tumor in November of the same year. After three days of hospitalization, she was discharged. Mdm. Chen mentioned that she found her stool volume was decreasing and had a bad odor one year ago, and she was lucky to have treatment early through her regular annual check-up. The condition of her stool has improved a lot and she is keen to have more fruit and water in her diet. \"I'm really lucky that it was discovered and treated early!\" Another patient, 84-year-old Mr. Hung, was diagnosed with colon cancer by another hospital in 2020. He was referred to the Colorectal Department for colon resection surgery. Half a year after the surgery, he was getting a follow-up colonoscopy and found to have another tumor 7 cm in size in the transverse colon. Considering his age and longer recovery period due to the potential severe surgical side effects, he didn't want to have another surgery so he was referred to the OPD of Dr. An-Ti Chang for an endoscopic mucosal resection of the tumor. The endoscopic surgery went smoothly and was completed in one and a half hours. He was able to eat six hours after the surgery and recovered well. He is living his life just like before and no residual or recurrent tumor cells were found in the 3-month post-op CT scan. Dr. An-Ti Chang indicated that there was only one choice in the past to remove bigger tumors from the colon; however, with the development the endoscopic techniques, for bigger pre-cancerous or early stage tumors, it's possible to use an endoscopic mucosal resection to remove tumors completely and keep the organ intact without opening the abdomen. Compared with traditional surgery, it offers the advantages of no wounds, faster post-op recovery and enhances the long-term quality of life of patients. It offers the same benefits to surgery as part of cancer treatment at early "}
