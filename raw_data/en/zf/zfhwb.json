The nursys.com Web site contains data obtained directly from the licensure systems of multiple boards of nursing through frequent, secured updates. Employers and the general public can now verify licenses and receive a detailed report within minutes, free of charge. This report will contain the name, jurisdiction(s), license type, license number(s), compact status (multistate/single state), license status, expiration date, discipline against license and discipline against privilege to practice (PTP) of the nurse being verified. Currently, nursys.com is the only verification tool available that provides status of a multistate licensee's privilege to practice in remote Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC) jurisdictions. Nurses (Official License Verification for a Fee) When a nurse applies for endorsement into a state, verifi- cation of existing or previously held licenses may be required. A nurse can use Nursys.com to request verification of licen- sure from a Nur syslicensure participating board. A list of licensure participating nursing boards can be found at Nursys.com. In order to be eligible for a multistate license in the Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC), the nurse must legally reside in an NLC state. An active, unencumbered, multistate license allows the nurse to practice in all NLC jurisdictions. Ques- tions about NLC eligibility and legal residency can be direct- ed to the board of nursing in the nurse's state of residency. Verifications can be processed by completing the online Nur sysverification process. The fee for this service is $30.00 per license type for each state board of nursing where the nurse is applying. Nur syslicense verification is sent to the endorsing board immediately. Please visit w ww.nursy s.com for more details. For more information, email nursy s@ncsbn.or g, caIl (312) 525-3780 or visit Nursys.com. Additional is available by visiting: https://w ww.ncsbn.or g/nlc .htmLPN SUPERVISION IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES In order for an LPN to supervise in an intermediate or skilled health care facility, the LPN MUST satisfactorily com- plete the board approved LPN Supervisory Course within six (6) months of employment in the supervisory role. The course is designed specifically for the supervision role in the long term care patient setting. A board approved nursing program or an approved provider of continuing education must provide the course. The area community colleges offer courses. It is the responsibility of the licensed practical nurse to maintain his or her certificate documenting completion of the course. A licensed practical nurse is entitled to supervise without the educational requirement outlined above if the licensed practical nurse was performing in a supervisory role on or before October 6, 1982. Verification is required. If licensees are unable to obtain the course within the first six months of employment, the LPN must write to the Board explaining the reason a waiver of the LPN Supervisory Course is being requested. Licensed practical nurses who are enrolled full-time in a registered nurse program are not exempt from the course. However, an LPN who is a full-time student in an RN program and who is scheduled to graduate within one year, may request a waiver by writing to the board office. The request for a waiver must state the number of credit hours to be taken each semester and include the student's expected date of graduation. Individuals who do not graduate from the RN program as scheduled or who are not successful on the RN-NCLEX\u00aemust take the next available course.November, December 2009, January 2010 - Iowa Board of Nursing Newsletter - Page 3 LICENSE RENEWAL . . .

The goal is that every child has an exam or screening by a dentist. However, due to barriers in accessing care this may not be possible for all families. For elementary students, the requirement allows that a den tist, dental hygienist, physician, physician assistant, registered nurse, or advanced registered nurse practitioner may provide a screening. For high school students, a screening must be provided by a dentist or dental hygienist. 6) What screening documentation is acceptable? The IDPH Certificate of Dental Screening is the only approved form that will be accepted for the 2009-2010 school year. For the initial 2008-2009 school year, other forms of documentation (including IDPH school dental cards) were allowed, but those will no longer be acceptable. To be valid, the certificate must be complete and the provider is responsible for completing the following sections: Treatment Needs (checking only one), Date of Dental Screen- ing, Provider Type, Name, Address, Phone, and Signature. The provider is also encouraged to assist with completing the parent/guardian section if that information is known. 7) Who can sign the certificate? The rules specify that the form must only be signed by the provider who does the exam/screening. Authorized use of a stamped or electronic signature is allowed. 8) How can I obtain the certificates? The Certificate of Dental Screening form can be down- loaded from the IDPH website or forms can be obtained through your local I-Smile coordinator or the Oral Health Bureau. Information is available h . Can the certificate be completed for a previous visit? Yes. If you provided an exam/screening during the allow- able timeframe (refer to Question #4), the form can be com- pleted based on the results of that exam/screening. 10) How should certificates be turned in to the schools? The form can be given to the student or parent/guardian to return to the school. In some cases, school nurses have worked with dental or medical providers to have the forms faxed or mailed directly to the school to expedite the process. 11) Is training available for physicians, physician assistants, or nurses to do the screenings? For the purpose of quality assurance and consistency, IDPH makes training and training materials available for non- dental health care providers. Trainings may be provided locally by I-Smile Coordinators or at state or regional meet- ings by IDPH Oral Health Bureau staff. 12) Can I share patient information with the school or other health care providers? Yes. The dental screening rules (Iowa Administrative Code 641.51.14) allow for dentists, dental hygienists, physi- cians, physician assistants, and nurses to disclose student dental screening information among each other and to the student's school. The rules can be accessed at Are exemptions allowed? Exemptions are allowed on an individual basis for reli- gious and financial hardship reasons. For a religious exemp- tion, the Certificate of Dental Screening Exemption must be signed by a parent or guardian and must be notarized. For a financial hardship exemption, the Certificate of Dental Screening Exemption must be signed by a dentist, dental hygienist, physician, physician assistant, registered nurse, or advanced registered nurse practitioner. Note: The listed health care providers may sign for either elementary or high school grade levels.

Approval may be grant- ed or continued within any time frame determined by the board for up to six years. \"Clinical facilities\" means locations where students directly care for patients/clients under the supervision of a qualified faculty member so that program outcomes are met. \"Clinical instruction\" means hands-on learning situations in which students directly care for patients/clients within a rele- vant setting, under the supervision of a qualified faculty member, so that program outcomes are met. \"Content\" means the subject matter in a given area of study. \"Controlling institution\" means the institution that has authority over and administrative accountability for the pro- gram(s). \"Curriculum\" means content, lab/simulation, observation and clinical experiences developed, implemented and evalu- ated by faculty to facilitate achievement of program out- comes and to meet the learning needs of students. \"Faculty\" means the teaching staff in a nursing education program. \"Faculty\"also means individuals who teach nursing in a nursing education program or who are hired to teach in a program on the basis of education, licensure or practice as a registered nurse. This definition includes anyone who pro- vides didactic or clinical instruction in nursing when assigned by the program to provide this instruction for courses includ- ed in the curriculum.

This new form of licensure and regulation will better protect the public by: Allowing competent nurses to provide care both physical- ly and electronically wherever care is needed; Providing the public ready access to and a choice of qual- ified nurses; Protecting clients against incompetent nurses or unsafe nursing care through better communication between boards of nursing, cooperative disciplinary investigations and prompt reporting of disciplinary action; Benefiting employers of nurses by having a more mobile workforce and a convenient centralized database for verifica- tion of licensure credentials. Understanding the Basics \u0013KThe nurse licensure compact allows a nurse who resides in a compact state to hold ONE license in the nurse's primary state of residence and practice in all other states in which the compact is in effect. Primary state of residence is where the nurse holds a driver's license, pays taxes and/or votes. \u0013KThe compact requires the nurse to practice according to the laws and regulations of the state in which the nurse provides care where the patient is located at the time the care is provided. The practice laws and regulations for many states are available online. \u0013KA nurse who is under discipline may be in a monitoring agreement, which restricts practice across state lines. \u0013KIf you hold a license in a COMPACT state and RESIDE in that COMPACT state, your license is a multistate license which authorizes you to practice in any other compact state. \u0013KIf you hold a license in a COMPACT state, but do not RESIDE in that compact state (reside in a non-compact state), your license is a single state license and it authorizes you to practice only in that compact state. For example, if you hold an Iowa nursing license, but do not live in Iowa, the license is a single state license and does not grant you the privilege to practice in any other state. \u0013KIf you are licensed in both Iowa and another compact state and RESIDE in the other compact state, your Iowa nurs- ing license will be administratively placed on inactive status immediately. Only one active license can be held by a licens- ee among the compact states. \u0013KThe compact does not supersede federal law. There- fore if you are employed in military service or work for the federal government, you may continue to hold a nursing license in any state you choose. If you are working as a nurse in a nongovernmental capacity, you are required to contact the state board of nursing in that state to determine if a nurs- ing license is required. \u0013KIf you move from one compact state to another com- pact state and practice nursing, you must obtain a license in your new home state. However, you may continue to prac- tice under the former home state license and the multistate licensure privilege in the new home state for a period not t o exceed 30 da ys. a. The 30-days shall begin with the date of hire/employment in the new primary state of resi- dence. b. If the licensee begins employment before changing primary state of residence, the 30-days begins upon the date that the licensee establishes the new pri- mary state of residence.
