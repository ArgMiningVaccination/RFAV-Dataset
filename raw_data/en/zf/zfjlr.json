Our bodies are exposed to toxins on a daily basis in the form of chemicals in our water, preservatives in our foods, and pollution in the air we breathe. Thankfully, there are ways we can help our body remove most of the daily toxins we're exposed to. How Can Essential Oils Detoxify My Body? To understand how essential oils can help detoxify your body, you must first understand how your body's natural detoxification system works. Your body has its own natural ways of removing harmful toxins from your organs and blood stream. The way it does this is by sweating, urination, bowel movements, and by simply exhaling. Essential oils help your detox efforts by augmenting or supplementing your body's natural processes. Why We Should Detox In a world filled with heavy industrial pollution, our exposure to environmental toxins varies on a daily basis. If we come into contact with heavy doses of toxins over a long period of time, the toxins will build up faster than our bodies can purge them. When toxins build up, our health status changes in subtle ways. We will begin feeling lethargic, unmotivated, under the weather, unable to focus, and our immune system will weaken causing us to become ill more easily and recover much slower. Essential oils can be used to help our bodies remove this excess amount of toxin to prevent them from wreaking havoc on our health. Let's take a look at the most powerful and beneficial essential oils you should use in the fight against toxins. 1. Cilantro Chelation is a technique that is useful for ridding the body of heavy metals such as mercury and lead which can accumulate in our body from various external sources such as amalgam fillings or even second hand smoke. It is done by introducing chelating agents into the body which then bind to the heavy metals and escort them out of your body through urine. The chelating effects of cilantro were [first noted by Dr. Yoshiaki Omura](https://www.drdavidwilliams.com/cilantro-clay-for-detoxification) after he noticed increased levels of heavy metals in a patient's urine after consumption of a certain soup. After further testing, cilantro was identified as the ingredient responsible for the increase in metals excreted. [Other benefits of cilantro essential oil](https://purepathessentialoils.com/cilantro-benefits/) include boosting your immune system and flavoring delicious soups and other meals (as the patient mentioned above could probably attest to!) To use cilantro essential oil, add 3-4 drops to your tea or water every day for a period of 10 days. 2. Rosemary Another essential oil that is a known iron chelator. Use it in a similar fashion to cilantro. 3. Lemon Myrtle Citral is a chemical compound which induces a group of detoxification enzymes called glutathione-S-transferase. These enzymes aid the detoxification process by [catalyzing the bonding of the antioxidant, glutathione](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1569131/) with harmful free radicals to prevent them from causing potentially irreparable damage to cells. Lemon myrtle is an essential oil that has a very high amount of citral - in fact, it is the highest natural source of the compound. This makes lemon myrtle essential oil an excellent addition to any detox routine. Incorporate this oil into your detox regimen by adding 10 drops to your diffuser and inhaling the healing properties or adding 4 to 5 drops in a veggie capsule or in a cup of tea/water. 4. Lemongrass Like lemon myrtle, lemongrass is extremely high in citral content. Use in a similar fashion. 5. Clove Antioxidants help your detox efforts by scavenging for free radicals which can do serious harm to your body and preoccupy your immune system, allowing other threats to wreak havoc. Clove is well known to be the most potent antioxidant essential oil there is. In fact, it has one of the highest antioxidant counts, period! As such, it should be an obvious addition to any detox routine because antioxidants are incredibly important for detoxing the body. Furthermore, an added benefit of clove is that it is also an iron chelator. To use clove essential oil, pour one drop for every six ounces of water. Do not go below this dilution because irritation may occur and that's no fun. "}
