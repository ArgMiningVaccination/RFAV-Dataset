These activities cut across virtu-ally every department in the hospital and every component of the medical staff. We truly arefortunate to work collaboratively with so many devoted physicians, nurses, and other healthcareprofessionals to bring comprehensive and coordinated care to our patients and their families. This year's report highlights our efforts in many comprehensive subspecialty care programs. At Hartford Hospital we are truly fortunate to have healthcare providers with special expertise inselected cancer sites, and this level of extra expertise provides us with \"more ways to make ourpatients better\". Specifically, this Cancer Program annual report allows us to describe our compre-hensive programs in prostate cancer, breast cancer, thoracic neoplasms, gynecologic cancer, andneurologic neoplasms. Each of these areas embraces a programmatic approach, which includes out-reach, prevention, early detection, treatment, support, education, and research. Each of these areasfosters a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approach including frequent subspecialty interdis-ciplinary conferences, programmatic development, and outcomes determinations. Hartford Hospital and its Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center are indeed most for- tunate to have a superb team of medical specialists, nurses, social workers, dietitians,physicists, engineers, counselors, pastoral care staff, and others who devote time andeffort to collaboratively develop individually tailored treatment and support plans forpatients and families. These individuals also give of themselves by serving on com-mittees, tumor boards, and conferences so that we can provide the best system of carefor our patients and continually educate our trainees and ourselves. In addition to our three-year accreditation by the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer in the teaching hospital division, we have also receivedthree-year accreditation by the American College of Radiology for our radiationoncology expertise. Our Cancer Registry, founded in 1928, is one of the oldest andlargest of its kind in the United States and maintains an excellent record of acquir-ing and analyzing data heavily utilized by our researchers. Research is an important part of our mission, and we continue to be active in prevention research, clinical trials, treatment research, cancer communications research, and cancer qual-ity of life research. Our collaborative relationship with Dana-Farber/Partners CancerCare con-tinues to offer Connecticut patient's unique cutting-edge trials otherwise unavailable in ourstate. Education of our patients, families, the public and healthcare professionals is also animportant component of our mission. Andrew L. Salner, MD, FACR (right) Robert E.

This seems to be directly related, in part, to the implementation of reminder notices sent to clients when they become eligible forreplacement products, according to their insurance policies. Clients have expressed gratitude for these notes because theyare helpful, but also because they represent a personal touch, indicating to the client that we really care about them asindividuals. Medicare patients especially appreciate the help in remembering when they are due for new products. Ourmarketing efforts of placing literature in physicians offices and patient waiting areas as well as educational ads communi-cates to our community that we have a special store for our cancer patients. Our surgeons and Partnership for Breast Carerefer clients to us for post mastectomy camisoles and prostheses for those clients that do not elect to have breast recon-struction. We appreciate these referrals, and patients appreciate a special place to obtain products that is convenientlylocated. We also offer head coverings, including scarves, wigs and hats, as well as special products utilized by patients whoundergo radiation therapy that assist in minimizing effects of their treatment. One item in particular that has seen a rise in popularity is the leisure bra. The staff in the radiation oncology department has been recommending this garment for ladies who have had a MammoSite treatment catheter placed because it is notrestrictive like a constructed bra, and it is wide enough to hold the dressing in place without the use of adhesive tape. Some of our original volunteers had to leave us for various personal reasons this year and we miss their presence. In their pla ces we have welcomed several new volunteers who each bring their own special strengths and talents to the Boutique. Their inter-est and enthusiasm adds that special element that continues to draw clients into the Boutique's unique atmosphere where theyfeel welcome and comfortable during a less than comfortable time in their lives. We're making a difference! Lorraine Casanelli, RN Boutique Coordinator Susan Wright, MBA Cancer Program Coordinator Cancer Clinical Research Office The Cancer Clinical Research Office (CCRO) is an active participant in a variety of national cooperative group research studies and several industry-supported trials. The office affiliation with Dana-Farber Partners/Cancer Care has providedthe CCRO with the opportunity to open additional cancer clinical trials. The CCRO supports multiple protocols spon-sored by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB), the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG), the National SurgicalAdjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) and the Radiation Oncology Therapy Group (RTOG). In 2006, overallpatient accrual to cancer clinical trials has nearly doubled compared to 2005. The NSABP \"STAR\" trial results were released and revealed that raloxifene was as effective as tamoxifen in preventing breast cancer in high-risk post-menopausal women. A new breast cancer prevention trial is planned for release within thenext year. Dr. Patricia DeFusco is the principal investigator for the NSABP treatment and prevention trials. Edith Clark,RN, OCN is the lead research nurse for the NSABP trials. Hartford Hospital continues on the forefront by offering anNSABP trial that compares radiation therapy techniques for early stage breast cancer. Hartford Hospital is now a parent institution for GOG. The trials have continued to recruit gynecologic oncology patients under the guidance of the principal investigator, Dr. Stacy Nerenstone and RN Coordinator, Camille Servodidio, RN,MPH, OCN. Dr. John Currie and Dr. Amy Brown have joined the team as gynecologic oncologists for Hartford Hospital.GOG # 199 is a prevention trial for women who are at increased genetic risk of ovarian cancer because either they or aclose relative has a genetic mutation (BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene) for ovarian cancer or they have a strong family history ofbreast and/or ovarian cancer.

Prostate cancer is the leading cancer diagno-sis in men and the second leading cause of malecancer deaths in Connecticut. Our comprehensiveprogram focuses on public education and out-reach, coordination of multidisciplinary treatmentand support services, patient and professional edu-cation, and research. This program can lessen theburden that prostate cancer has on the residents ofConnecticut by offering a full range of cuttingedge diagnostic and therapeutic techniques givingmen and their families maximal alternatives. As ateam, the various specialties involved in treatingprostate cancer patients, including Urology,Radiation Oncology, Medical Oncology, DiagnosticRadiology, and Pathology are able to collaborateto determine the best course of treatment. Thepower of our own extensive expertise in special-ized techniques such as robotic surgery; IMRT,IGRT, and brachytherapy radiation; programs; analy-sis; and our multidisciplinary conferences onprostate cancer give our program a leading-edge inability to have healthy and happy prostate cancersurvivors.

Hartford Hospital is one of the top recruiting sites for this trial. GOG # 220 is studying proteins in the blood of patients who haveplanned surgery to remove a pelvic mass. GOG also sponsors chemotherapy treatment trials for gynecologic cancers. A new Dana-Farber/Partners CancerCare trial for metastatic breast cancer compares a novel Epothilone drug BMS- 247550, (a new IV chemotherapy drug) plus Capecitabine (a pill form of chemotherapy) versus Capecitabine alone inwomen who have been previously treated with or are resistant to an Anthracycline and are Taxane resistant. A CALGBtrial compares Cytoxan and Adriamcyin chemotherapy versus Taxol in women with node negative breast cancer. Apromising CALGB trial for Chronic Lymphoid Leukemia, lead by Dr. W . Jeffrey Baker, includes IV chemotherapyFludarabine plus Rituximab followed by an injection of Alemtuzamab. Dr. Siegel is the principal investigator for Dana-Farber/Partners CancerCare and CALGB trials. Hartford Hospital has recently been approved as an affiliate site forRTOG, Radiation Therapy Oncology Group. Dr. Kenneth Leopold is the principal investigator for the RTOG trials andDiane Neri RN, OCN is the lead research nurse for four trials, which offer cutting edge treatments for breast, head andneck, non-small cell lung cancer and prostate cancer. Finally, the best \"treatment\" for cancer is to either prevent it or detect it early. Since 1995, the CCRO has been involved in the Connecticut Breast & Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (CBCCEDP), a state sponsored outreach programthat provides clinical breast examinations, mammograms and cervical cancer screening to the underserved and underin-sured women of the greater Hartford area. A total of 50 cancers have been detected. These outreach efforts are fundedby the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and organized by the State of Connecticut Department ofPublic Health. Dr. Merwood Jones serves as medical director. The CCRO continues in its sixth year with the CDC fund-ed WISEWOMAN grant, and interventions have included nutrition and exercise educational series and cooking demon-stration classes. The A VON Foundation Breast Care Fund grant supports outreach and breast cancer education and mate-rials in the community for underserved and underinsured women. These are intriguing times in cancer research and treatment. The CCRO remains committed to our patients and fami- lies through education, screening, and participation in clinical trials. Camille Servodidio, RN, MPH, CRNO, OCN, CCRP RN Coordinator Robert Siegel, MD Medical Director Cancer Nursing Over the last year the staff of Oncology and Palliative Medicine have settled in to their new home on our inpatient unit on Bliss 5. Our patients have benefited from the private rooms and associated amenities for their families and visitors. Allmembers of the health care team contribute to ensure that quality care continues to be provided in an atmosphere thatfocuses on the satisfaction for our patients and staff. Our Hematology/Oncology outpatient unit in the Cancer Centerand Radiation Oncology areas continue to show growth and satisfaction of patients treated by such a dedicated team ofprofessionals. Nurses in all these areas are specialized and empowered to practice autonomously with a focus on initiat-ing positive change to better meet the needs of our patients. Cancer clinical research nurses and staff have nearly dou-bled accruals to clinical trials this year while continuing to perform community outreach programs and education, andadvocating for programs that assist those in need. treating patientsthroughthefullspectrumoftheircarefromearlydetection on 4 HARTFORD HOSPITAL CANCER PROGRAMclinical programs In all areas of the Cancer Program staff dedication goes beyond their daily clinical responsibilities to numerous commu- nity outreach initiatives. Employees passionately dedicate their time to numerous events throughout the year that aim atprevention, early detection, treatment and support of the community we serve. Nursing within the Cancer Program continues to be highlighted and recognized for the professional efforts of many staff. Professional memberships have increased as well as attendance of leadership and staff nurses at local and national con-ferences. Cancer Program nurses continue to present Oncology Nursing Society approved courses and are asked to pres-ent at conferences on successful quality projects. Kathy D. Burns, RN, MSN, OCN, and Mary Kate Eanniello, RN, OCN,CHPN, continue to teach the Radiation Therapy course while Patricia Rathmann APRN, OCN, Nancy Discenza RN, Clinical Leader, OCN, and Darcie Shewokis RN, Clinical Leader, OCN, are instructors for theChemotherapy/Biotherapy Course for community nurses throughout Connecticut. Nursing Certification is encouraged and supported by the Oncology Leadership team. As a fellow of the 2005 ONS Leadership Development Institute, Camille Servodidio, RN Coordinator of the Cancer Clinical Research Office, select-ed recognition of certified oncology nurses at Hartford Hospital as her year-long project. After a needs assessment surveywas distributed to all oncology nurses within the Cancer Program, nurses listed the receipt of an OCN pin and name list-ed on wall plaques as two of the top choices for recognizing their passing the oncology certification examination. DuringNurses' Week in May 2006, the second annual \"mocktail\" party was held and all certified oncology nurses received a sil-ver OCN pin from Dr. Andrew Salner, Director of the Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center. Nurses obtaining their oncol-ogy nursing certification in 2006 were Rhea DeBari RN, OCN, and Kathleen Hunter RN, OCN, and Mary Kate EanielloRN, OCN, CHPN, became certified in Hospice and Palliative Nursing. Excellence in Nursing awards were also present-ed by Laura Caramanica, Vice President of Nursing and Pamela Vecchiarino, Director of Cancer Nursing. Special recog-nition awards went to Rhea DeBari RN, OCN, for the Nightingale Award for Excellence in Nursing and to Kathleen D.Burns RN, MSN, OCN, for the Nursing Spectrum Regional Excellence Award in Leading and Advancing the Profession.Patricia Rathmann APRN, OCN, was also recognized at the ceremony for receiving her APRN degree. Throughout the year, certified oncology nurses were honored and recognized in local Hartford Hospital newsletters as well as New England nursing publications. Nursing leadership sponsored a 100% OCN Party to celebrate the threeCancer Program units that achieved 100% certification: Hematology Oncology, Research Bliss 5 inpatient unit achieved 30% OCN certification with others certified in Hospice andPalliative Nursing. The collaborative management team along with the president of the ONCC presented each unit a 100% plaque for their accomplishments. A recognition plaque listing all certified oncology nurses in the Cancer Program will be hung in thehallway of the Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center. Camille Servodidio and Kathy Burns were instrumental in submit-ting Hartford Hospital for the Oncology Nursing Certification Corporation's Employer Recognition Award. Amongsttwenty organizations nominated to be recognized for providing sustained support for and recognition of oncology nursingcertification, Hartford Hospital was chosen to receive this award which will be presented at the National OncologySociety annual meeting in April 2007. The efforts of our oncology nurses demonstrate the commitment, clinical excellence, and professionalism that are inte- gral to our Magnet designation. We continue to be proud of all Cancer Center nurses and staff who role model serviceexcellence behaviors and uphold the standards that create such an exceptional patient care environment. The cancernursing leadership team will continue to establish goals and expectations to achieve optimal outcomes for our patientsand nursing community.

The researchers looked at the struggles of patients in health crises, and tried tounderstand what their unmet needs were. They discovered that patients often had difficulty finding good information,were hesitant or unable to attend support group meetings, and were being pressed to make difficult decisions before theyhad adequate information, support and personal confidence about what decision might be best for them. These issues hit home in an extremely personal way for Dr. Gustafson when his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer. They had to make very difficult decisions in a short amount of time. They found themselves desperately needing resourcesto help them think through these decisions on their own. As a result of Dr Gustafson's personal experience, and that of so many others, the team realized that if CHESS was to be effective, it needed to help patients and their families become much more actively involved in their treatment and recov-ery. It also needed to make high quality information and social support easily accessible and usable and equip people tomake good choices and decisions based on their individual needs. CHESS had to address issues around behavior changeand implementation of difficult decisions, and connect people with similar crises together to share their experience andlearn from one another. Ultimately, they wanted to see individuals and family units cope more effectively with their cri-sis, suffer less, and feel like they'd made better decisions as a result of using CHESS.* Fast forward to this year, 2006. Hartford Hospital has been offering CHESS to its patients for 10 years, since it accepted the University of Wisconsin's invitation to partner with them in their research. This year alone we have reached 266 menand women through CHESS and CHESS research projects. We have also expanded our reach in Connecticut by collab-orating with Windham Hospital to offer CHESS to patients in the Eastern part of the state. We continued to offer threeinnovative communication research studies to our breast cancer and prostate cancer patients. Centers of Excellence in Cancer Communication. The Mentor Integration Project and the Component and Couple Analysis of Cancer Communication are both NationalCancer Institute grants, in partnership with the University of Wisconsin. These studies target women who have beendiagnosed with breast cancer within the last two months. Recruitment to these randomized studies will continue untilMarch of 2007. The M.D. Anderson Cancer Center also collaborates on this work. Web-based Support for Informal Caregivers in Cancer is a study funded by the National Institute of Nursing Research and the National Institute of Health, and looks at ways to reduce caregiver burden through the use of CHESS informa-tion, skills building and emotional support. We expect the results of these studies to contribute valuable information about ways to use the Internet and other com- munication tools to improve the quality of life for all cancer patients. CHESS continues to be supported by grants and donations here at Hartford Hospital as we move forward with our research. Because of the generosity of our donors we have been able to loan computers to those patients who cannot affordtheir own computer. We can also offer free Internet access and training on the use of CHESS and the Internet to anyonewho needs it. As one patient said, \"I knew very little about cancer, and CHESS opened my eyes to what the future mayor may not have in store for me. I do have options and choices.\" * Information taken from the CHESS web site: https://chess.chsra.wisc.edu/ Diane Ward RN, BSN, OCN\u00ae CHESS Program Coordinator Hartford Hospital Cancer Program treating patientsthroughthefullspectrumoftheircarefromearlydetection on 6 HARTFORD HOSPITAL CANCER PROGRAMbreast cancer services Breast cancer risk analysis Education and resources services Genetic counseling and testing Image-guided biopsy Lymphedema treatment program Mammography Participation in clinical trials Reconstructive surgery Sentinel node biopsy Stereotactic needle biopsy Ultrasound Formed in 2001, the Partnership for Breast Care (PBC) represents a coordinated, comprehensive,easily accessible system of care for women withbreast problems.

Members of the Hartford Hospital Cancer Program multi-disciplinary clinical breast teaminclude radiation and medicaloncologists, breast surgeons,plastic surgeons, pathologists,geneticists, radiologists, dieti-tians, research & support nursesand staff at their weekly pre-treatment breast conference clinical programs Hematology The Hematology section of the Department of Medicine consists of six members, most of whom have dual appointments in oncology as well. Our newest member is Dr. Sean Mullally fresh out of training from the Tufts program at BaystateMedical Center in Springfield. The section continues to have an active inpatient service of referrals, and 10 to 20 pri-mary care hematologic patients most of whom have leukemia, high-grade lymphoma, or complications of therapy, main-ly neutropenic sepsis and pain. There is a small group of end-of-life patients on the palliative care service, also on ourunit on B5E. The consult service consists of an array of pancytopenias, bleeding and clotting disorders and unusual hema-tologic ailments. We receive about 300 new referrals yearly in the hospital and office for new patients with leukemias,lymphomas, myelodysplasias, myeloproliferative disorders, and myeloma, as well as an equal number of benign ailments.Advances in treatment include newer agents Dasatinib Zevalin,Campath); release of Revlimid for second line myeloma therapy. There also is a new oral iron chelator Exjade, which willprobably replace Desferal. We have tended to send patients with high-risk hematologic disorders to transplant centers,mainly Harvard, and Yale, with some improvement in long-term survival likely. Newer diagnostic tests include the JAK-2 genetic mutation for myeloproliferative disorders like Polycythemia Vera and thrombocythemia; and a battery of FISH markers for a variety of malignancies, coordinated by our new hematopathologistDr. Mnayer. We continue to have a collegial, friendly relationship with the University of Connecticut, and are an integralpart of their teaching program. Fellows split their time between the two medical groups, Oncology Associates, and CMG,with 2 to 3 month rotations on each service, both inpatient and clinic; and also have had horizontal clinics for a half dayper week in our offices in order to follow patients for prolonged periods. Approximately half the time we also have a med-ical resident rotating through the service, again dividing his time between the two offices on a week- by- week basis. Grandrounds topics this year included acute myelogenous leukemia (Firshein), and multiple myeloma (Dailey). Stephen Firshein, MD Division Chief, Hematology Medical Oncology Hartford Hospital's Division of Medical Oncology provides state-of-the-art cancer care for patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. As the overall United States population ages, the number of new cancer patients is projectedto increase by 50% over the next 20 years. By participation in multi-institutional clinical trials through the GynecologicOncology Group (GOG), the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP), and the Cancer andLeukemia Group B (CALGB), patients throughout central Connecticut will have access to the newest available treat-ments. Dr. Robert Siegel is the Chairman of Hartford Hospital's Institutional Review Committee and is the MedicalDirector of the Cancer Clinical Research Office. The Division of Medical Oncology has 12 board-certified medical oncologists, one advanced-practice oncology nurse practitioner, as well as a support staff of more than 35 oncology nurses, secretaries, and laboratory technicians. Althoughall members of the Division see a wide spectrum of cancers, several members do have particular areas of expertise. Dr.Stacy Nerenstone has worked closely with Dr. Joel Sorosky coordinating treatment of patients with a wide range of gyne-cologic malignancies. Dr. Robert Siegel collaborates with the physicians at the Dana-Farber/Partners CancerCenter andtreats many patients with soft tissue sarcomas, malignant melanomas, and many other rare malignancies. Dr. JeffreyKamradt has research expertise in genitourinary oncology with particular interest in treating patients with advancedprostate cancer. Dr. Timothy Hong's research has concentrated on gastrointestinal malignancies. Dr. Schauer, Dr.DeFusco, Dr. Nerenstone, and Dr. Baker have worked closely with Dr. Elizabeth Brady in the surgical department as partof the Partnership for Breast Care and have made the weekly breast cancer planning conference a very successful teach-ing conference. The inpatient medical oncology unit has been relocated to Bliss 5 in Hartford Hospital. treating patientsthroughthefullspectrumoftheircarefromearlydetection on 8 HARTFORD HOSPITAL CANCER PROGRAMclinical programs The Division remains committed to providing medical education to medical students, interns, resident physicians, and medical oncology fellows. Multidisciplinary educational patient care conferences are held in conjunction with theDepartments of Surgery, Urology, Neurology, Thoracic Surgery, Gynecology, Pathology, and Radiation Oncology. In addi-tion to Hartford Hospital's weekly Oncology Tumor Board and monthly lymphoma rounds, a weekly breast cancer plan-ning conference is held under the direction of Dr. Elizabeth Brady from the Department of Surgery. Outpatient treatments are currently provided at the Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center as well as at satellite facilities in Avon, Windham, Southington, and Wethersfield. This is a very exciting time for medical oncology as a specialty. Manyso-called targeted treatments with both less toxicity as well as greater efficacy are now available for a wide range of malig-nancies. Clinical studies that are currently in progress are investigating many new agents, which should become availablewithin the next several years. We are very optimistic that the results of these basic research studies will provide far more options for our patients.Peter K. Schauer, MD, FACP Division Chief, Medical Oncology Nutrition Services The Registered Dietitians in the Cancer Program continue to assist and support cancer patients and their families by pro- viding nutritional information, education and guidance during their treatment, and afterwards. A strong effort has beenmade to provide seamless patient care between the inpatient and outpatient setting. This has been very successful withour tube feeding patients. In addition to the direct patient care provided, nutrition education programs have been conducted at Hartford Hospital's support groups (ovarian, brain, and prostate). Public outreach programs (Women's Health Fair, Breast Cancer AwarenessMonth Program, and the Team Towanda annual fundraiser) had nutrition represented with a Dietitian to answer ques-tions and distribute nutritional materials. Additional programs and patient support events the Dietitian has beeninvolved in are New Beginnings, Celebrate Life, The Remembrance Service, The Fritts Symposium, and The MaryMulready Sullivan Oncology Symposium. Articles for the column \"Nutrition Tidbits\" in the Cancer Program Newsletter have been successful and the Dietitian has provided healthy recipes for the Advanced Prostate Support Group Newsletter and in the Cancer Center Atrium. Education for professionals was achieved by mentoring 4 University of Connecticut Dietetic Interns during their Dietetic Internship. Guest lecturing at the School of Allied Health at the University of Connecticut and the University of NewHaven helped stimulate potential interest in the area of cancer and the role of nutrition. The Cancer Center Dietitiantaught the nutrition section for the Hartford Hospital School of Allied Health Radiation Therapy Technology Programand was an instructor for the Registry Review for new graduates of Radiation Therapy programs across the country. Ann Zogbaum, MS, RD Registered Dietitian Oncology Social Work Services The overall goal of the oncology social work team is to minimize the negative impact of cancer by offering supportive services as outlined in the Cancer Program's mission statement. During the 2005-2006 fiscal year, our oncology socialworkers continued to provide psychosocial interventions for cancer patients and their families that included emotionalsupport, advocacy, resource referrals, education, and guidance. 9 HARTFORD HOSPITAL CANCER PROGRAMtreatingpatientsthroughthefullspectrum oftheir care fromearlydetectiononclinical programstreating patientsthroughthefullspectrumoftheircarefromearlydetection on In addition to the Cancer Program inpatient and outpatient direct service caseload, our oncology social work team strives to meet the needs of patients through public outreach. In April and September of 2006 our social work team collaborat-ed with CancerCare to offer \"Family Night\", a workshop for parents or caregivers with cancer, their partners, and theirchildren ages five through twelve. In response to feedback from patients and their families, our oncology social workersplan to expand on our educational and support series for next year. This series will focus on concrete topics such as finan-cial guidance, social security disability, home care options, advance directives and insurance. Other topics will includecoping with fatigue and other side effects of treatment. In an effort to support the psychosocial needs of our patients, partnering with the American Cancer Society, the oncol- ogy social work team facilitates monthly \"Look Good...Feel Better\" workshops. Other programs in which our social workteam has been involved includes Celebrate Life, the Annual Remembrance Service, and the Cancer Program'sBereavement Committee. Additionally, our oncology social workers facilitate the Bliss 5E Patient and Family ResourceLibrary and Hartford Hospital's Brain Tumor Support Group. They also regularly collaborate on goals of care with ourPalliative Medicine Consult Service. The oncology social workers also participate in the Cancer Program's PsychosocialTask Force, weekly outpatient radiation rounds, new patient conferences, as well as The Cancer Committee, The CancerProgram Advisory Committee and The Oncology Health Care Team Meeting. Through attendance at various seminarsand conferences throughout the year, our oncology social workers take advantage of continuous learning opportunities ofvalue to the population served by the Cancer Program. Finally, our oncology social workers also collaborate with othermental health practitioners in the community as well as state and private agencies for the purpose of coordinatingresources and strengthening the Cancer Program. Charmain Ali, LCSW and Hillary Keller, LCSW Oncology Clinical Social W ork Team Palliative Care At Hartford Hospital, the need for Palliative Medicine continues to grow. In October of 2005, as part of the ongoing devel- opment of Palliative Medicine, the Cancer Program in collaboration with overall strategic planning realized that this needgrew beyond the walls of CB-4, the former Palliative Care Unit, and moved the inpatient Oncology floor along with thePalliative Care Unit together and created a more comprehensive system of care. In addition, a Palliative Medicine ConsultService was developed to help meet patient needs on every hospital unit, and became fully operational in July of 2005. Thenewly formed Oncology and Palliative Medicine unit has a 26-bed capacity with 4 designated beds for Palliative Medicine.This designated area preserved the integrity of the former unit and its philosophy by incorporating the amenities whichcomplement compassionate care. The remodeling of the new space includes a family lounge, kitchen, library and resourceroom and quiet space. In addition to the 4 beds, the unit provides more Palliative Medicine beds as needed. Having accessto the Palliative Medicine unit and the consult service has provided a unique opportunity for patients' needing palliativeand hospice services along the continuum of care. We currently collaborate with 4 local Greater Hartford Visiting Nurseagencies that help support and facilitate the goals of care which can be served in the community. These agencies workclosely with our Care Continuum department to provide placement in skilled nursing facilities, assisted living and when-ever possible, return the patient to their home with supportive nursing and hospice care. The Palliative Medicine service is an interdisciplinary team dedicated to consultative clinical care, education and serv- ice excellence. The service is active in teaching residents, nurses, and has become an integral part of the CancerProgram. As we look into the near future, we recognize the need for more community outreach to deliver palliative andend of life care for who access to more comprehensive care can be limited.

By 2006 wehad contact with over 1,500 women with a new breast problem or breast cancer. As part of the team that rolled out \"Take the Time\" mobile mammography program, the PBC facilitates community part- nerships, the PBC provides the outreach, schedules the visits, ensures the completion of paperwork, provides the track-ing and follow-up of patients who access mobile mammography and is responsible for oversight of grants, gifts and dona-tions for the program. In the first year of being on the road the service was out in the community on 42 days and provid-ed 445 screening mammograms. Nearly 30% of the women accessing the service did not have insurance coverage; thecosts were covered from gifts and grants. The PBC held the first annual Pink Flamingos fund raising event on 9/27/06 as a kick off to breast cancer awareness month. This event, held in The Hartford Financial Services Group Tower Suite and attended by nearly 200 guests, hadRuthAnn Lobo as the keynote speaker and netted over $44,000. Save the date for the 2007 Pink Flamingos to be heldon Wednesday September 26th! The PBC introduced the John F . McCormack Award for Excellence in Patient Care designed to recognize an MD or RN staff. Nominations for this award are only accepted from patients. Displays were posted in the specialty care offices andareas in the hospital with postcards for patients to use in nominating a staff member. Each October the PBC Board ofDirectors will select the award recipients. For 2006 the following individuals were selected: Kim Klos of ConnecticutMultispecialty Group, Corine Jones of Jefferson Radiology, and Linda Skiff of Hartford Hospital Cancer Program. Necessities Bags are now available to our patients having mastectomy with or without reconstruction. These reusable totes provide information and supplies to help one prepare for surgery. Roxanne P . Rotondaro, MPH Coordinator Edward Cronin, MD Medical Director Pastoral Services Facing a health crisis such as cancer is difficult for patients, their families, and their professional caregivers. Cancer con- fronts us with the possibility of death and challenges us to reflect on the meaning of our lives and the implications of ourillness. The Pastoral Services Department recognizes this reality, and works to help all involved reflect on the spiritual,religious, and philosophical aspects of cancer. A spiritual or religious grounding can help a patient and his or her familyas they seek to find comfort and courage, having been thrown into the mental and emotional turmoil that comes withfacing cancer. In addressing spiritual needs, staff members including chaplains take their lead from the wishes of thepatient and family. Chaplains are available to listen, empathize, and provide comfort. When desired, chaplains are alsoavailable to pray or lead ritual as well as guided imagery. Fr. James Ibekwe and Chaplain Lara Hoke are primarily involved with cancer patients, their families, and their profes- sional caregivers, but the entire Pastoral Services Department plays a part in this ministry, sharing in the 24 hour on-callresponse team. In so doing, we are assisted in innumerable ways by the insights of other dedicated hospital staff. Attentionis given both within and without - through the Oncology Unit at Hartford Hospital and through the Gray CancerCenter, which serves the greater community. It is with an open-mind and a ready heart that we approach this rewarding yet difficult task. Father James Ibekwe, PhD Chaplain Lara Hoke, M.Div. Pastoral Services Department treating patientsthroughthefullspectrumoftheircarefromearlydetection on 12 HARTFORD HOSPITAL CANCER PROGRAMclinical programs Psycho-Oncology The Hartford Hospital Cancer Program and the Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center reach out to the community in so many ways. As part of the ongoing advances of this comprehensive program, the Psycho-Oncology interdisciplinary teamcontinues to embrace many supportive services which the patient and their family can access during this critical time oftheir life. While focusing on survival, careful attention is dedicated to the quality of the individual's life. Through thecollaboration of Social Services, Nutrition, Pastoral Care, Psychiatry and the many Support Groups, we intervene inmany ways to improve the physical, emotional, social and spiritual aspects of a patient's journey. We currently offer support groups and seminars which include: Brain Tumor Support, \"Look Good...Feel Better\", New Beginnings, Prostate Cancer Support and Advanced Prostate Cancer Support Groups, Women with Cancer,Bereavement and a new program called \"Family Night\" in collaboration with the Cancer Care organization. Each groupis another example of how we are meeting patient's needs by reaching out as they are reaching in. Collaboration is what makes a patient feel \"held\" by a system of care. To further that cause, we benefit from work of The Partnership for Breast Care, the Department of Psychosomatic Medicine that provided 172 inpatient consultations andthe Palliative Medicine unit and Palliative Medicine Consult Service. Evan Fox, MD Medical Director, Palliative Medicine Unit Psycho-Oncologist, Division of Consultive Psychiatry Quality of Life Research An ever-present goal during a patient's journey through cancer diagnosis and treatment is to maximize the likelihood of eradication of disease and at the same time minimize adverse affects from the cancer and its treatment. This importantfocus has generated significant interest in developing research studies to further understand all the domains which impactquality of life. Hartford Hospital actively participates in this type of research, both by looking at quality of life issues inmany of our standard cancer clinical trials, but also by conducting specific targeted studies on quality of life itself. Our CHESS studies underway focus on how we might best support patients and families, both at the time of initial can- cer diagnosis, as well as during the experience of advanced disease. These studies, performed in conjunction with theUniversity of Wisconsin as well as the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, help us to understand how we can marry technol-ogy and human support to help both cancer patients and their families. A second type of quality of life research has focused on factors, which impact psychological, spiritual, and emotional domains of cancer survivors. In collaboration with the researchers from the Departments of Family Studies andPsychology at the University of Connecticut-Storrs, we continue to study how patients cope with their cancer experi-ence through a series of grants including a Lance Armstrong Foundation grant. It is hoped that these types of studies willhelp result in information which will allow us to develop strategies for better supporting patients and families during andafter their treatment. Andrew L. Salner, MD, FACR Director, Cancer Program 13 HARTFORD HOSPITAL CANCER PROGRAMtreatingpatientsthroughthefullspectrum oftheir care fromearlydetectiononclinical programs Radiation Oncology Hartford Hospital's Radiation Oncology department is one of the most comprehensive of its kind in New England and provides comprehensive services for cancer patients in collaboration with other members of the patient's multidiscipli-nary team. Services include: Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy Image-Guided Radiation Therapy utilizing ultrasound, implanted fiducial markers, cone beam CT 3-Dimensional Conformal Rate Brachytherapy for prostate cancer, gynecologic cancer, head and neck cancer, sarcoma, and other sites High-Dose Rate Brachytherapy for breast cancer, prostate cancer, sarcoma, lung cancer, esophageal cancer, and other sites Systemic Radioisotopes in the management of bony metastatic disease and certain types of lymphomaA multidisciplinary team including physicists, dosimetrists, engineers, radiation therapists, nurses, social workers, dieti- tians, data management staff, and clerical staff work with Radiation Oncology physicians to develop an optimal individ-ually tailored treatment plan for each patient. This team meets regularly and has active programs in quality improvement,peer review, new patient management, and patient satisfaction. Hartford Hospital is the first in the state of Connecticut to acquire the Triology Linear Accelerator by Varian Medical Systems. This system is the most accurate and powerful of its kind produced and provides conventional and intensitymodulated radiation therapy (IMRT), image guided radiation therapy (IGRT), and stereotactic radiation therapy andradiosurgery (SRT and SRS). A representing neurology, neurosurgery, radiation oncology, neuro imaging, and med-ical physics collaborates in the management of patients with benign and malignant central nervous system neoplasms aswell as benign conditions, which would benefit from the utilization of stereotactic therapy. Radiation oncologists participate in a wide array of cancer conferences at Hartford Hospital and surrounding institutions designed to optimize prospective patient management, collaboration amongst specialists, advancement in multidiscipli-nary care, enhancement of clinical research, and education of medical staff, house staff, and students. RadiationOncologists actively participate in the teaching programs of the Hartford Hospital School for the Radiation TherapyTechnology. Radiation Oncologists also participate in the hospital's community outreach efforts designed to advanceawareness of and screening for cancer in the underserved population in the communities we serve. Radiation Oncologists work closely with medical oncology, surgery, primary care physicians, gynecologic oncologists, neu- rooncologists, and other members of the medical team to design appropriately tailored treatment plans for patients. Wealso focus on providing appropriate support and rehabilitation services, as well. The Radiation Oncology department continues to enjoy a very high patient satisfaction rating and is a preferred site of therapy for many cancer patients in our region. As the leader in cancer care delivery in Connecticut, we continue to beproud of our advanced technology, superb staff, and contributions we make as members of the cancer care delivery team Andrew. L. Salner, MD, FACR Medical Director Robert E. Rice, MS, DABR, FAAPM Department Head & Chief Medical Physicist treating patientsthroughthefullspectrumoftheircarefromearlydetection on 14 HARTFORD HOSPITAL CANCER PROGRAMclinical programs School of Allied Health - Radiation Therapy Program The Hartford Hospital sponsored Radiation Therapy Program is a 24-month certificate program, which gives students the skills necessary to apply for national certification and become Radiation Therapists. These individuals provide care andquality radiation treatments to patients under the direction of the radiation oncologist. This program, accredited by the Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic Technologists, began in 1989 witha generous grant from the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving. Students enrolled in the program gain valuable clini-cal experience at many sites statewide. This additional experience helps to prepare students for an evolving career as aradiation therapist. Since its inception numerous students have graduated and are currently working as radiation thera-pists, dosimetrists, supervisors and educators providing exceptional care to cancer patients throughout Connecticut. As one of 102 programs in the country, we have 100% certification pass rate in which the scores are in the top third in the country. Many people contribute to the success of the program including two full time faculty members and one parttime faculty member, Radiation Oncology Department staff including the radiation therapists, dosimetrists, physicists,physicians, nurses and dietitian are involved with teaching both clinical and didactic. This enhances the quality of thestudent's education. The success of the program is evaluated annually during an advisory committee meeting where pro-gram outcomes are reviewed. Hartford Hospital program officials organize and host the New England Society of Radiation Therapists Registry Review. This annual event reviews the contents for students preparing for their certification exam. This year 251 students camerepresenting 28 different states and over a third of the programs nation wide. The collaboration and dedication of the department of education, program staff and radiation oncology department make it possible for us to provide excellent training for students which leads to exceptional care for the patients. Nora Uricchio, M.Ed, RT (R) (T), Program Director Radiation Therapy Program Hartford Hospital Cancer Committee Report The Cancer Committee was established to foster the care of cancer patients at Hartford Hospital. The Committee mem- bers monitor all cancer programs at the hospital, perform quality checks of registry data, and participate in the develop-ment and review of patient care practices and studies. This year the Cancer Committee continued its efforts to facilitatethe conversion of the cancer staging process to a digital format. The committee worked earnestly to develop an \"e-stag-ing\" form that could be implemented in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. While only partially completed dueto current software system constraints, the efforts to date have resulted in improved efficiencies on several levels. Theultimate goal is more accurate and timely data capture in order to facilitate outcome analysis and thereby improve over-all cancer care. The committee has encouraged the development of regular tumor boards in various specialties. Weeklyand monthly conferences in gynecologic and thoracic oncology have been added to those already occurring in surgery,lymphoma, breast, neurologic and urologic oncology. It has also facilitated participation with the Yale Shared Resourcegroup in two NIH studies on testicular cancer and meningioma risk factors and outcomes. The committee remains com-mitted to meeting or exceeding all national standards for data management and patient care as established by our certi-fying organization the American College of Surgeons. Toward this end our tumor registry manager, Deborah Jacques, participated in a national \"survey savvy \" conference designed to keep institutions like ours on the leading edge of nation-al comprehensive cancer programs. Lastly, the committee would like to thank retired physician Dr. David Hild for theconsiderable time and effort he has expended in helping us in our data collection efforts and ongoing patient care qual-ity reviews.

They provide direction for establishing, supporting and maintaining standards as anACOS accredited Cancer Program. The new liaison physician at Hartford Hospital is Ramon Jimenez, M.D., FACS.Robert J. Piorkowski, M.D., FACS serves as Connecticut State Chair for the ACOS and along with the liaison physicianattends annual meetings both at the state level and at the Commission on Cancer (CoC) national meetings held in Apriland October. The liaison physician at Hartford Hospital is a member of the Cancer Committee and the Cancer Advisory Committee, providing updates on ACOS changes to the Committee members. The State Chairman for the CoC is a member of theExecutive Committee for the Connecticut Chapter of the American College of Surgeons. He chairs an annual breakfastwith liaison physicians throughout the state. He also moderates the resident competition on cancer papers presented atthe annual meeting of the Chapter of the American College of Surgeons in November. The State Chairman also sits onthe Executive Committee for the Cancer Control Plan for the State of Connecticut. In accordance with CoC approval standards, the liaison and Cancer Committee monitor the Hartford Hospital cancer conferences and weekly Department of Surgery Tumor Boards. CoC benchmarking data was utilized for national compar-isons in our annual report. Hartford Hospital cancer registry data was released through the Facility Information ProfileSystem (FIPS) to the American Cancer Society (ACS) as a level II submission. This provides information to the publicon services and resources available to them at our hospital. Robert J. Piorkowski, MD, FACS State Chairman for American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer Cancer Registry Report The Cancer Registry at Hartford Hospital houses data on almost 85,000 cancer cases who were diagnosed and/or treatedat our facility since 1928. Over 2500 new cases are added to the database each year. All five Cancer Registry record ana-lysts at Hartford Hospital are Certified Tumor Registrars (CTR). This certification assures that all cancer data is collect-ed using all standardization guidelines established by national and international agencies such as the World HealthOrganization (WHO), North American Association Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) and the NCI. The Registry staff are dedicated professionals that consistently exceed the high standards set by the American College of Surgeons as part of the Commission on Cancer Approvals program and as part of the SEER program (Surveillance,Epidemiology and End Results) of the NCI (National Cancer Institute). In 2005, the Cancer Registry CTR's hosted an educational meeting of their peers, The Tumor Registrars of CT, (TRAC). This year, the Registrars also attend a variety of local, regional and national educational seminars to maintain their cer-tification. Deborah J. Jacques, MSM, CTR Cancer Registry Managercollaborative partners The Imaging Center The Imaging Center at Hartford Hospital is comprised of 40 Board Certified Attending Radiologists and 2 full time spe- cialized Physician Assistants. The staff encompasses specialty training and expertise in all aspects of Diagnostic Imagingand Intervention. The Department's Diagnostic Radiology Residency program remains fully accredited by the RRC andACGME and is currently training 20 Radiology Residents. We continue to provide the most comprehensive imaging and intervention services in the region with an ever-growing role in the diagnosis, care and management of patients with cancer. We have introduced the latest in integrated digitalimaging solutions in conjunction with the newest developments in cross sectional imaging. Our 3-D laboratory contin-ues to find expanding roles for reconstructive CT and MR imaging in disease diagnosis and management. These advance-ments have provided the most sophisticated tools for early detection and display of neoplasms. PET/CT applications con-tinue to play a central role in tumor diagnosis and management with a continuing growth in approved indications. The Division of Interventional Radiology continues to expand its services with growth in pain management and tumor therapies. The demand for chemoembolization therapies for patients with inoperable tumors has continued to grow. Dr.John Foster has begun to offer radioactive microsphere embolization at Hartford Hospital making us one very few centersin the Northeast offering this treatment in collaboration with our Radiation Oncologists. Cryoablation of liver, kidneyand lung lesions in patients with contraindications to surgical resection are being performed in greater numbers and withexcellent results. The Department continues to participate in all multi-disciplinary conferences throughout the institution with represen- tation on the various Cancer Committees where we bring our extensive imaging and intervention expertise to assist inthe care of this patient population. The Imaging Center remains committed to bringing the finest, most advanced technologies into the hands of the bright- est clinicians to support the provision of the most advanced cancer care available in the region. Stuart K. Markowitz, MD Chairman, Imaging Center, Hartford Hospital Gynecologic Oncology Physicians from the Division of Gynecologic Oncology collaborate with medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, pathologists, radiologists, and other cancer specialists in planning and providing comprehensive care for patients withgynecologic cancer and their families. We participate in clinical trials offered by the Gynecologic Oncology Group(GOG), the only National Cancer Institute (NCI) funded cooperative group dedicated exclusively to the women withgynecologic cancers. This affords our patients the opportunity to participate in studies previously available only at greatgeographic distances from their homes and families. Over 50 women participated in clinical trials this year. CamilleServodidio RN, Cancer Clinical Research Office, coordinated patient care among the physicians involved with this proj-ect. This research project truly reflects the team effort involved in cancer research at Hartford Hospital. During 2006, Amy K. Brown, MD, MPH joined us. She was a resident at the University of Rochester and a fellow in Gynecologic Oncology at Brown University. Dr. Brown has enormous experience in minimally invasive surgery. She willbe directing our robotic program in gynecologic oncology. The success of our division at Hartford Hospital is due to the close collaboration among a variety of dedicated cancer researchers. Our clinical volume continues to grow. We have a gynecologic oncology tumor board that meets twicemonthly. The departments of medical oncology, radiation oncology, radiology, and pathology regularly attend this clini-cal, research, and educational session to provide extremely well coordinated patient care.

Sorosky, MD Gynecologic Oncology 17 HARTFORD HOSPITAL CANCER PROGRAMtreatingpatientsthroughthefullspectrum oftheir care fromearlydetectiononcollaborative partners Hereditary Cancer Program The family history should not be overlooked when planning the treatment and management of a patient with cancer. Medical genetics is an important part of the Cancer Program team. Approximately 5-10% of all breast, ovarian and coloncancer is hereditary. Significant hereditary characteristics include cancer under the age of 50; bilateral cancers or multi-ple primaries in the same individual; associated cancers such as breast and ovarian, or colon and uterine cancer; and mul-tiple affected family members in multiple generations. Ethnic background may be important as well. Individuals in theAshkenazi Jewish population, for example, have a somewhat higher chance of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Boththe maternal and paternal family histories are relevant. Genetic counseling by the Hereditary Cancer Program is available to those persons with cancer and/or other extended family members. The consultation consists of reviewing a detailed family history, discussing the principles of hereditarycancer, and an individual risk assessment for a hereditary cancer syndrome. Patients considering testing receive informa-tion regarding the risks, benefits, and limitations of genetic analysis. Participation in available research protocols is alsoencouraged. Hartford Hospital's collaborative approach is a critical component of our success. We have been particularly excited to work with the Cancer Clinical Research Office and the Ovarian Cancer Prevention and Early Detection Study (spon-sored by the National Cancer Institute). The weekly Pretreatment Breast Conference provides a forum for education aswell as discussion of complex management issues. We also have DNA banking program that allows patients to store theirDNA for possible future testing. Over 400 patients were seen in 2006. The Hereditary Cancer Program of the Divisionof Human Genetics, University of Connecticut Health Center, has been serving the patients, physicians, nurses and otherhealth professionals of the Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center since 1992. Jennifer Stroop, MS Robin Schwartz, MS Certified Genetic Counselors Robert Greenstein, MD Director of Hereditary Cancer Program of the Division of Human Genetics Integrative Medicine IInntteeggrraattiivvee MMeeddiicciinneecontinues to offer compassionate healing modalities to our patients, families, staff and the commu- nity for their comfort and enhancing the healing of mind, body and spirit. Reiki, a Japanese hands-on relaxation technique, can provide stress reduction and pain relief, as well as a reduction in fatigue, nausea, and depression for patients receiving chemotherapy and radiation. Patients report that Reiki is verysoothing and supportive in conjunction with their medical treatments. Some also say it helps them think more clearlywhen making the important decisions they need to make concerning their treatment. Reiki sessions are available topatients and families in inpatient Oncology as well as Hematology and Radiation oncology. In 2006, our specially trainedReiki Volunteers provided 2555 Reiki sessions in Oncology. Reiki training classes are also available to patients and fam-ilies at Hartford Hospital twice monthly. MMaassssaaggee TThheerraappyyoffers many benefits to Oncology patients including relief from pain and anxiety, improved sleep and circulation, enhanced immune function and overall sense of well-being. The partnership between the Hartford HospitalMedical Massage Program and the Connecticut Center for Massage Therapy provides students with a valuable part oftheir training.

Our Artist in Residence and the Creativity Coach Volunteers works with individualsand in groups, and with both inpatients and outpatients in the Cancer Program. Patients who have participated in thisprogram receive a great deal of valuable insight and meaning from the process. Our TTaaii CChhiiand YYooggaainstructors continue to participate in the Gray Cancer Center's New Beginnings program provid- ing the women enrolled in the program instruction and information on these two holistic exercise systems. One of theprogram's goals is to provide breast cancer patients with healthy options that they can incorporate into their lifestyles. Marcia Rothwell, LMT Director of Integrative Medicine Department of Medicine Emily F. Fritts Symposium The Cancer Program organized this yearly symposium with the guiding principle being to offer a program that will enrichthe lives of cancer patients. The family of Emily Fritts generously established this fund in her memory. Emily loved gar-dening, and the first annual program was held in May, 2005 that featured two motivational speakers. In 2006 the pro-gram featured Dr. Susan Bauer Wu, RN/PhD from Dana-Farber/Partners CancerCare along with The English lady,Allison Demers from WRCH as well as floral design demonstrations. Breast Community Education and Outreach Hartford Hospital Cancer Program and the Partnership for Breast Care have expanded the community education, collab-orative activities, and events that are related to breast cancer awareness and education. Educational sessions have beenoffered throughout the Greater Hartford Area on such topics as Ductal carcinoma in Situ by Dr. Robert Siegel; Womenat High Risk for Breast Cancer by Dr. Patricial DeFusco; and a Life after Breast Cancer Community education programin a local community. September through May each year, the Partnership for Breast Care prints a monthly educationalarticle focusing on the breast health or cancer topic. Yearly, Hartford Hospital sponsors teams for annual fundraising walksfor Komen, American Cancer Society, and the Connecticut Breast Health Initiative. Breast cancer screenings are offeredat annual community health fairs such as the Hispanic Health Council and Community Health Services fairs, wheremobile mammography service is provided at no charge to women. 19 HARTFORD HOSPITAL CANCER PROGRAMtreatingpatientsthroughthefullspectrum oftheir care fromearlydetectionon Community Programsgynocologic cancer services Coordinated comprehensive care GOG clinical trials funded by NCI Innovative systemic therapy options including intraperitoneal chemotherapyMinimally invasive and robotic surgeryMultidisciplinary coordinated in gyneco- logic oncology provides the region's best care for women with cancers ofthe ovary, fallopian tube, uterus, cervix, vagina, vulva, the Division with medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, pathologists, radi-ologists, and other cancer specialists in planning and providing compre-hensive care for patients with gynecologic cancer and their families.Research is an active component of the program, including participa-tion in clinical trials offered by the Gynecologic Oncology Group(GOG), the only National Cancer Institute (NCI) funded cooperativegroup dedicated exclusively to the women with gynecologic cancers.This affords our patients the opportunity to participate in studies previ-ously available only at great geographic distances from their homes andfamilies. Unique program components include minimally invasive androbotic surgery; a range of radiation therapy options including IMRT,HDR and LDR brachytherapy; numerous innovative systemic therapyalternatives; multidisciplinary consensus conferences; unique supportprograms; and active education and research efforts. We also provideone of the state's largest and most respected breast and cervical cancerearly detection programs to help reach underserved women with freeexams, pap smears, and mammograms. All of these efforts result in ourrecognition as one of the state's leaders in gynecologic oncology. Amy Brown, MD, MPH, one of three gynecologic oncologists, performsrobotic surgery with daVinci system.Patients benefit by this expertise withminimally invasive gynecologic sur-gery in selected casescollaborative partners Neurological Oncology Neuro Oncology provides comprehensive services to patients with tumors of the brain and for cancer patients with neu- rological symptoms. Patients with primary brain tumors receive comprehensive care and treatment from a multidiscipli-nary brain tumor management team comprised of physicians from Neurosurgery, Radiation Oncology, Medical Oncologyand Neuro Oncology, and Social Workers to help with their complex needs. Patients with systemic cancer are assistedwith pain management, and diagnosis and treatment of different neurological problems related to cancer and its manage-ment. Additional help with coping is provided by our Brain Tumor Support Group. Our neurosurgeons use state-of-the-art technology, with computer- assisted navigation system (Brain Lab) to precisely define the tumor and minimize the damage to the normal brain during surgery. The Radiation Oncology department offers innovative techniques, such as IMRT and radiosurgery for treatment of primary and metastatic brain tumors. Dr. Alexandra Flowers, one of only two trained Neuro Oncologists in Connecticut sees over 100 patients with primary brain tumors per year, and also patients with metastatic disease. She has set up new treatment protocols for patients withnewly diagnosed and recurrent malignant gliomas and for patients with brain metastases from systemic cancer. Dr. Flowersis board certified in Neurology, with Neuro Oncology training at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Alexandra Flowers, MD Neuro Oncology Pain Management/Anesthesia The Anesthesia Pain Service consults each year on a number of oncology patients with difficult pain problems. The role of the service has primarily been one of caring for patients who have required implantable delivery systems to provideanalgesics directly to the neuraxis (into the spinal canal or epidural space). These patients have failed to achieve ade-quate analgesia or may suffer unacceptable side effects from simpler pain control regimens. Patients, whose pain is inad-equately controlled with oral narcotics, can be cared for at home with visiting nurse assistance even though a narcotic orlocal anesthetic is being continually delivered into the spinal canal. The Anesthesia Pain Service and the home healthcare agency maintain contact with the patient and monitor the effectiveness of the implanted delivery system so that thepatient can be as independent as possible. Palliative care plays a critical role whenever a patient needs more services than can be provided at home. State of Connecticut regulations covering the scope of nursing practice preclude caring for patients with spinal or epiduralcatheters in a nursing home. The palliative medicine consult service is a valuable resource for these patients with painand other needs. It is hoped that regulatory changes can be made to allow for more flexibility in placement of patientswith spinal delivery systems. Other interventional procedures include neurolytic blocks (involving permanent destruction of a nerve) such as a celiac plexus block, and a variety of simpler techniques (such as epidural steroid injections) that are used commonly in patientswith benign chronic pain. The Anesthesia Pain Service is always available as a resource when its services are needed, andduring the past year has added two experienced pain practitioners to further enhance our service. Jeffrey Morrow, MD Anesthesia Pain Service 21 HARTFORD HOSPITAL CANCER PROGRAMtreatingpatientsthroughthefullspectrum oftheir care fromearlydetectiononcollaborative partners Pain Management/Pharmacy The Pharmacy Pain Control Service at Hartford Hospital has been very busy this past year. We saw 1,080 patients for pain relief or symptom control such as nausea and vomiting. The majority of these patients were inpatients. However, wealso saw outpatients in both Radiation and Hematology/Oncology Services. During this past year we also provided in-service education to physician and mid-level practitioner staff and to nurses par- ticipating in the Palliative Medicine Training Program. We have had medical students and medical residents from theUniversity of Connecticut School of Medicine rounding on the service as well as pharmacy students from the Universityof CT School of Pharmacy. This year we will be having students from the University of Puerto Rico College of Pharmacyrotating through the service. The Pain Management Service is a separate but integral part of the Palliative MedicineService. Our goal this year is to continue training more of the pharmacist staff as Pain Management Consultants. Richard Gannon, Pharm. D. Department of Pharmacy Services Pathology and Laboratory Medicine The Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine is composed of 15 Board Certified Pathologists and 4 Ph.D. Laboratory Scientists, many of who received their training at major cancer centers including Memorial Sloan-KetteringCancer Center and M.D. Anderson Hospital. The department continues to have an active training program based atHartford Hospital with a total of 20 residents and fellows. The department supports the Cancer Program by co-sponsor-ing three weekly Tumor Boards (general surgical oncology, breast oncology, and pediatric oncology) and bi-weekly uro-logic and gynecologic oncology conferences. Members of the Department participate in a variety of national cancer study groups including the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Project (NSABP), the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG), and the Children's Oncology Group.During the past year members of the department have authored 10 papers in refereed journals and presented a total of 9abstracts. Dr. Laila Mnayer joined the Department this year as the Director of the Molecular Pathology Laboratory. She brings con- siderable expertise to the Cancer Program in an area that is becoming increasingly important in the diagnosis and man-agement of oncology patients. With her assistance, we now have the capability to evaluate DNA microsatellite instabil-ity in colon cancers and also offer the Urovision FISH assay for detecting bladder cancers in urine samples. Plans are cur-rently underway to establish a cytogenetics laboratory at Hartford Hospital. Cytogenetic testing is crucial in the evalua-tion of hematopoietic malignancies and is expected to be an increasingly important tool in the characterization of solidtumors in both children and adults. Mark E. Ludwig, MD Section Director, Anatomic Pathology Surgical Oncology Over the past year the Department of Surgery under the guidance of Dr Robert Piorkowski has actively been in the process of creating a Division of Surgical Oncology within the Department. The Department of Surgery has met withmembers of the Radiation Oncology Department and Medical Oncology of the Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center tointegrate this Division into the Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center. The Division of Surgical Oncology will have five sections; which will include 1) colon and rectal cancers, 2) liver, bil- iary, pancreatic and upper GI malignancies, 3) head and neck tumors, sarcomas and melanomas, 4) breast cancer, and 5)thoracic malignancies. Each section will be responsible for standardization of care, quality assurance, data management, treating patientsthroughthefullspectrumoftheircarefromearlydetection on 22 HARTFORD HOSPITAL CANCER PROGRAMcollaborative partners education, and morbidity and mortality reporting. By organizing these sections into a Surgical Oncology Division and working closely with radiation and medical oncology at the Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center, the Department ofSurgery will promote excellence in the care of the cancer patient. The Partnership for Breast Care and the Brownstone Clinic continue to meet the needs of the Greater Hartford commu- nity providing state-of-the-art, multidisciplinary, patient-centered care for patients with breast disease and breast cancer.The breast surgeons within the Department of Surgery regularly enroll patients in the clinical trials; thereby offering cut-ting-edge, therapeutic options for patients with breast cancer. These surgeons also coordinate clinical trials and consultswith other appropriate specialists. The number of minimally-invasive breast biopsies have increased steadily over the past years. These procedures include core needle biopsies, mammatome biopsies and stereotactic or ultrasound-guided biopsies. Mammatome biopsies ensurea large enough specimen using a vacuum technique. Non-palpable breast lesions or biopsies using either computerizedmammographic guidance (this is the stereotactic biopsy) are also ultrasound-guided. Visual-guided, excisional biopsiescontinue to comprise the early stratagem in the diagnosis and management of breast cancer. The advantage of early diag-nosis utilizing invasive and minimally invasive approaches is that patients with benign findings are spared surgery andthat patients with cancer can expeditiously undergo definitive surgery. Hartford Hospital's surgeons are among only a few in the state trained in the placement of the MammoSite balloon catheter, the newest technology allowing for partial breast irradiation. A select group of women with invasive breast can-cer who consider breast conservation treatment with lumpectomy can undergo radiation to the lumpectomy site in a weekwith twice daily radiation treatments. The balloon is placed in the operating room into the lumpectomy cavity and isremoved in the radiation therapy department immediately following the final treatment. The use of sentinel node biopsies for identification and evaluation of axillary node involvement in breast cancer contin- ues to be standard treatment at Hartford Hospital. Hartford Hospital is one of the few hospitals in Connecticut that hasthe technology to biopsy early breast lesions detected on MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). An ultrasound machinehas been added to the Brownstone Breast Clinic, which now provides ultrasound-guided biopsies and sonographic eval-uation of complex breast masses. This year has again seen an increased use of laparoscopic techniques for the surgical treatment of colorectal cancers. Colonic intraluminal stents have been introduced to relieve obstructing cancers for palliation without surgery. In addition, multiplegenetic colorectal cancer syndromes have been recognized and a familial colorectal cancer registry is being initiated. The Department of Surgery continues to offer a multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of liver tumors. Working in conjunction with medical oncology and interventional radiology, minimally invasive liver resections are being performedwith excellent radiofrequency ablation using a newly up-graded state-of-the-art ultrasoundtechnology has been instituted. The Department of Surgery continues to provide cutting edge treatment as well as an excellent multidisciplinary approach for the treatment of the cancer patient today. The Department of Surgery has continued to take an active rolein the palliative care team to help both the cancer patient and families cope with both the social and end-of-life issues. STATISTICAL INFORMATION The Hartford Hospital Diagnostic Breast Center and Jefferson X-Ray Group Partnership for Breast Care performed approximately 40,000 mammograms in 2004. Approximately 1,000 stereotactic breast biopsy procedures were performedalong with about 300 ultrasound guided breast core biopsy procedures, 700 breast needle localization procedures usingmammographic and ultrasound guidance and 74 MR guided breast localization procedures. This constitutes the largestexperience with breast interventional procedures in Connecticut. New cases of breast cancer total 518 in the past year with 500 operative procedures performed. 61 women underwent total or modified-radical mastectomy with the majority undergoing breast conservation procedures. Sentinel lymph node map-ping to avoid extensive axillary dissection is being used with increased success and new multi-modality techniques areachieving earlier diagnoses of breast cancer. This year 158 sentinel node biopsies were conducted. 23 HARTFORD HOSPITAL CANCER PROGRAMtreatingpatientsthroughthefullspectrum oftheir care fromearlydetectiononservices Clinical research Coordinated comprehensive care Multidisciplinary neuro conferences Sophisticated stereotactic radiosurgery and radiation therapywith Trilogy Neuro-oncologist Patient support groupHartford Hospital's Neuro Oncology program provides comprehensive services to patients with tumors of the brain and central nervous system, and to cancerpatients with neurological symptoms or difficulties. Patients with primary braintumors receive comprehensive care and treatment from a multidisciplinary braintumor management team comprised of physicians from Neurosurgery, NeuroImaging, Neuropathology, Radiation Oncology, Medical Oncology and NeuroOncology, and Social Workers to help with their complex needs. Patients withsystemic cancer are assisted with pain management, and diagnosis and treatmentof different neurological problems related to cancer and its management.Additional help with coping is provided to patients and families by our BrainTumor Support Group. Unique program components include neurosurgical resection or stereotactic biopsies; radiation malignant conditions; combined modality therapies; unique neurovascularand neuroimaging programs; and education and research efforts. Treatment team consisting of radiation oncologist, (Susan Kim, MD) neurooncologist (Alexandra Flowers, MD) andtwo radiation therapists (BlancheJackson, RT(T) and Elaine Blanchard,RT(T) position patient for stereotacticradiosurgery treatment. neurologic cancer collaborative partners Hartford Hospital evaluated 215 new cases of cancers of the colon and rectum, and 194 colo-rectal operations were per- formed during the calendar year. Minimally-invasive (laparoscopic-hand assisted) resectional techniques are practicedwith increased frequency, and Hartford Hospital remains at the forefront with these minimally-invasive procedures tomanage both benign and malignant disorders of the colon. The institution evaluated 18 new esophageal cancers and per-formed 8 operations for esophageal cancers - reflecting better staging techniques to limit operations on those who wouldnot benefit from surgery. The number of esophageal resections decreased due to a more realistic approach to curability ofthese lesions and the use of stents and chemoirradiation for palliative therapy. Thirty-four new cases of gastric cancer wereevaluated, of which 22 patients underwent surgical procedures. Seventy-two new cases of cancer of the head and neckregion were operated on at Hartford Hospital, 39 of these were thyroid cancer. A collaborative, multi-disciplinaryapproach to the diagnoses of head and neck malignancies continues as this institution evaluated approximately 33 casesof cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx (including a range of head and neck malignancies focused on lip, tongue, mouthand pharynx) in the Department of Surgery. Hartford Hospital's physicians saw 234 cases of lung cancer this past year, 79 of these cases underwent surgical resection. Again, more accurate staging of unresectable or incurable disease seems to have diminished both the number of referralsand number who undergo operations. Finally, 56 new cases of pancreatic cancer were evaluated in the past year; 16 under-went surgical resections. MRI, CT, endo-luminal ultrasound, laparoscopy and other diagnostic modalities provide a better patient selection, eliminat- ing those who in the past would have undergone surgical exploration but could not have had a curative resection. In areaswith very poor survival statistics; i.e., esophagus, pancreas, lung, and some gastrointestinal tumors, the overall number ofoperations are decreased, however the improved selection process gives more of the remaining a realistic hope of cure. Orlando C. Kirton, MD, FACS, FCCM, FCCP Director, Department of Surgery Marilyn A. Folcik, RN, MPH, CPHQ Assistant Director, Department of Surgery Urologic Oncology The Department of Urology at Hartford Hospital has become the largest center for robotic cancer surgery and minimal- ly invasive urologic surgery in New England. In the three years since it arrived, more than 600 men have successfullyundergone prostate cancer surgery with the \"da Vinci Surgical Robot\". The results with this state-of-the-art procedurecontinue to be very encouraging in terms of both cancer control and maintenance of quality o life. A second robot isscheduled to be delivered in early 2007 as the use of this device is expanded to patients with bladder cancer and topatients with cardiac, gynecologic and pediatric diseases. The Prostate Cancer Program at Hartford Hospital benefited in 2006 from the proceeds of the annual Black and Red Gala. With this funding, a formal Comprehensive Prostate Cancer Program was established. The purpose of this programis to facilitate and coordinate all aspects of prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment for our patients and their families.Mr. Matthew Burke was appointed as the full time coordinator of the program, assisted by members of the departmentsof Urology, Radiation Oncology, and Medical Oncology. We are very excited about this program and the enhanced levelof care it offers to our patients and to the community. When it comes to kidney cancer, the technique of selective \"renal sparing\" surgery has become the gold standard. This allows for the removal of cancerous tumors with maximum preservation of normal kidney tissue and function. HartfordHospital is the premier center for minimally invasive renal sparing surgery in New England. The Department of Urologyis actively recruiting additional oncologic surgeons to assure that Hartford Hospital is well positioned and to remain aleader in all aspects of urologic cancer care in the future.

Many other partners both inside and outside the Hospital collaborate in these efforts. Each year Hartford Hospital physicians and staff conduct 4 to 8 free cancer screening and awareness events in associa- tion with local organizations. Over this past year, we have participated in such events in collaboration with the HispanicHealth Council, Community Health Services, the First Cathedral, Mount Moriah and CME Phillips churches. At theseevents, we deliver information concerning lung cancer awareness and prevention, colorectal awareness and early detec-tion, and provide clinical breast exams and breast cancer awareness, mammography and prostate cancer awareness andfree screening with digital rectal exams and PSA blood tests. In addition to Hartford Hospital staff that volunteer to workat these events, physicians volunteer their time to conduct screenings, give lectures, and answer questions. We have beenfortunate to have involvement by physicians from the Department of Urology, Radiation Oncology, Medicine, Surgery,Medical Oncology, amongst others participate in our efforts. In addition, Hartford Hospital physicians deliver education-al talks concerning breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, and general cancer awareness throughoutthe community over the course of a year, on a volunteer basis. We continue to be a leading site for the Center for Disease Control/State of Connecticut Department of Public Health Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. Thus far we have entered 1700 people into this program, includ-ing 239 in the past year. We have detected a total of 50 cancers (7 this past year) and have provided follow-up servicesfor these women. Our annual screening efforts this past year were held as part of community health fairs. We participated in the Hispanic Health Council Health Fair in August, and in October brought screening to the First Cathedral Wellness Fair, includingour mobile mammography program, \"Take the Time\", consisting of a van with a transportable mammogram unit. We wereable to provide screening and awareness for Breast Cancer by providing mammograms, clinical breast examinations andtraining/information on breast self examination. We distributed colorectal test kits for at-home screening for colorectalcancers in women. Men were offered colorectal screenings during exams for prostate cancer detection. Over 100 menwere screened at these events for prostate cancer, including collection of blood specimens for determination of PSA lev-els, a tool that is important for early detection of prostate cancer. During May-June, the Cancer Program sponsored seven American Cancer Society Relay for Life events and participated in the annual Komen race for breast cancer awareness. The Mary Mulready Sullivan Oncology Symposium is our major educational symposium for health care providers, offered in spring each year. This past year our 17th annual symposium focused on innovations in targeted cancer therapies.Distinguished speakers from Massachusetts General Hospital, Dana-Farber/Partners CancerCare, and Weill-Cornell MedicalCollege presented on the development and application of targeted therapies used in breast, lung and colon cancers. The Hartford Hospital Cancer Program sponsored a booth at the Buick Open PGA golf tournament. This information table was staffed with volunteers from the Cancer Program Prostate Cancer support groups, who distributed literatureabout the importance of prostate cancer detection. Live radio broadcasts were held from the booth. The Cancer Program participated in the CIGNA Futures Golf Tournament, \"Chip in for the Cure\" in July at Gillette Ridge Golf Course in Bloomfield. The Cancer Program and Partnership for Breast Health also participated in the healthcomponent of the Women's Fair sponsored by Hartford Hospital at the new Connecticut Convention Center. Breast can-cer detection and awareness materials were distributed at both of these events. High-risk seminars are held quarterly in conjunction with the Partnership for Breast Care and the Cancer Clinical Research Office. Dr. Patricia DeFusco presents a timely topic during these meetings. In conjunction with WRCH Lite 100.5 radio station, Hartford Hospital again sponsored this year's Night of Lite Laughter on October 21st featuring the Smother's Brothers. This event was held at the Bushnell and attracted a sell-out crowd of2,500. Information about breast cancer prevention and early detection was distributed to those who attended this event.A special community symposium was held in West Hartford to kick off breast cancer awareness month on October 10th.This symposium, entitled \"Advances in Breast Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis and Treatment\" featured Hartford Hospitalspeakers on topics of prevention, pathology, imaging and the latest research and treatments. This program, organized by the Cancer Program, is held annually the second Sunday in June to celebrate cancer survivor's month. Now init's 16th year, this celebration of life has grown in popularity - over1,000 attendees - such that it outgrew available space on the HartfordHospital campus and is now held indoors in a spacious, air-condi-tioned facility at the Learning Corridor. It is one of the largest cancersurvivor celebrations in the Northeast. celebrate lifeat HHsupport programs Brain Tumor Support Group Our monthly Brain Tumor Support Group meetings are open to anyone who has been diagnosed with a brain tumor and their caregivers. The purpose of the group is to provide emotional support and resource information to people in the com-munity who are dealing with the often-profound impact of a brain tumor diagnosis and treatment. Through mutual sup-port, shared insight, and information exchange, participants often feel increased hope and an enriched quality of life asthey face their unwelcome situation. Being part of this unique peer social network helps alleviate the tremendous strainof adjusting to a \"new normal\". Hillary Keller, LCSW Breast Cancer Support Group Breast Cancer Support Group meetings are held on the third Thursday of each month. Every other month we alternate an educational evening with one of traditional support. This year, our educational evenings began with Sheila Belzer, acertified Kripalu Yoga Instructor and member of our Health Sciences Library staff guiding the women in \"Chair Yoga andmore...\" On another evening, Diana Boehnert, Artist-in-Residence and Coordinator of our ART for Healing Program,Integrative Medicine Department, worked with the women doing expressive art. Another month, Andrew Salner, M.D.,Cancer Program Director, presented \"Radiation Therapy Updates\" to a large and curious audience. One evening welearned how to meditate and on another we shared the books that have given us the best support through our breast can-cer journeys. We hope to continue our evenings of traditional support, alternating with programs of interest, openingthem to all women with cancer. Diane Ward RN, BSN, OCN\u00ae Look Good...Feel Better (with American Cancer Society) Hartford Hospital Cancer Program, in collaboration with the American Cancer Society, sponsors a monthly Look Good Feel Better program. This is a free service that teaches female cancer patients beauty techniques to help restore theirappearance and self-image during chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Volunteer cosmetologists lead small groups through practical, hands-on experience. Women learn about makup tech- niques, skin care, nail care, and options related to hair loss such as wigs, turbans, and scarves. Each participant receivesa free kit of cosmetics to use during and after the workshop. This past year, over 50 women participated in this program. Charmain Ali, LCSW New Beginnings New Beginnings is a 6-week program facilitated by Cancer Program dietitian, and designed to help women transition from cancer treatment to a healthy lifestyle. All participants have completed their treatment (except for hormone ther-apy). The women learn techniques to implement for healthy eating, exercise, Tai Chi, Yoga and ways to begin to moveforward with their lives. The groups are purposely kept small (no more than 12) to provide an environment where thewomen feel comfortable participating. Strong emphasis is placed on sharing, be it a healthy recipe or a technique to helpothers in the group regain normalcy in their life. Certified instructors whose emphasis is listening to your body and adjust-ing activity to meet the individual's physical needs teach the Exercise, Yoga and Tai Chi. An Oncology Social Workerhelps the women express their fears of reoccurrence and changes that have developed as a result of their cancer an theirtreatments. Ann Zogbaum, RD treating patientsthroughthefullspectrumoftheircarefromearlydetection on 28 HARTFORD HOSPITAL CANCER PROGRAMsupport programs Ovarian Cancer Support Group The ovarian cancer support group is unique in its structure and history. It is the only group in Connecticut that is com- mitted to education and support for women with ovarian cancer.The group focuses on meeting the diverse and challeng-ing needs facing women with this diagnosis. Over the past year, the monthly group has focused on issues related to coping with treatment, disease recurrence and options for clinical trials. At least three times a year, the group collaborates with other support groups to offer education-al programs for all women with cancer. This enables women with all types of cancer to find support and strength througheducation and peer support. The group attracts women from all over the state who come together to identify issues and concerns regarding preven- tion, early detection and comprehensive caring to women with an ovarian cancer diagnosis. This past year, the group has been exceptionally active with 10-12 women attending per month. As a celebration of ovar- ian cancer awareness month in September, the Cancer Program sponsored a tea that was attending by group members ata local tea parlor. Marcia Caruso-Bergman, RN, AOCN, APRN Prostate Cancer Support Group A remarkable accomplishment was achieved in 2006! Fifteen years of support and community service by the Group were celebrated at an anniversary gala held at Hartford Hospital's Education Resource Center on June 6. It is unusual for agroup to remain active for such a consistent length of time. Jim Calhoun, UCONN men's basketball coach and fellowmember of the \"reluctant brotherhood\", was guest speaker. He talked about his personal experience dealing with prostatecancer as well as his love for the young men whom he coaches. It was a delightful evening, with many members and spe-cial guests in attendance. Group coordinator, Peg Garrison, received special recognition from members commemoratingher 15 years of service to the group. We had a busy and productive year as several of our 800 members expanded the mission of education, information and support to the public. Volunteers staffed the Hartford Hospital Prostate Health Awareness booth, June 27th to July 2nd,marking the 11th year at the Buick Championship Golf Tournament (formerly the GHO). Prominent radio stationsWTIC-AM and WRCH-FM again broadcast directly from the booth on Pro-Am day. Group members also assisted withhealth fairs, screenings, 1:1 support for newly diagnosed patients and a \"Run, Walk, Roll\" event Sept. 9th at RiverfrontRecapture in Hartford. Proceeds from that event went to the Hartford Hospital Comprehensive Prostate Cancer Program. The 6th annual Reluctant Brotherhood Golf Tournament \"Fun Raiser\" was June 26th. The second annual Rock Cats base- ball \"fun outing\" was August 21st with group member, Clem Hitchcock, singing the National Anthem prior to the game. Margaret A.

Men in this Group are very well informed, bothabout their cancer status and also about their treatment options and where to go for the most effective care. The groupdiscussions help train patients to identify any changes in bodily form or function, alerting physicians to quickly diagnoseand treat problems. A now yearly visit with medical oncologist Dr. Robert Siegel detailing his most recent experienceswith patients in clinical trials is heavily attended. Many of our members have been in the Group for several years, and have formed bonds of friendship both within and outside of the meetings. We have a luncheon group that meets every other month outside of the Hospital. Members sharelife experiences, trips, and family experiences, both happy and sorrowful with each other. When someone dies, we talktogether to honor the memory of someone we have known and loved over our time together in the Group. At the end of the year a holiday party celebrates another year of survival with this chronic disease. In 2007, the Group will begin its14th year, thanks to the support from the Gray Cancer Center and the Department of Urology. Carole B.C. Fox, CURN Support Group Coordinator Spouse Prostate Cancer Support Group The group met every other month for 3 sessions this year. Because of declining attendance, coordinators Peg Garrison and Carole Fox decided to place the group on hiatus to reexamine its purpose. Based on feedback from members, women want to focus more on dealing with their partner's cancer diagnosis and treat- ment issues and less on stress reduction for themselves. It is likely that meetings will resume in 2007 as part of the main P .C.S.G.'s breakout session rather than on a separate night. The key to success for any support group is membership involvement; otherwise they wither and die on the vine. This is an important point for group leaders to remember. We hope for a resurgence of growth in 2007! Margaret A. Garrison, APRN, BC Carole B.C.
