Dr. Danielle Harkins, DC of BodyWorks Chiropractic in Euless, TX is a doctor of chiropractic who can help you with various health issues by using acupuncture. Below is more information about this method. What Is Acupuncture? Acupuncture is an ancient form of medicine that originated in China. Very thin needles are inserted just below the surface of the skin to promote healing and relieve pain. Traditional Chinese medicine uses acupuncture to reconnect the flow of energy throughout the body. When the body is showing signs of distress and pain, this means that something is not connected to this flow, known as chi. Acupuncture can help connect all parts of the body's energy so that the chi is not interrupted. This energy flows through specific pathways, called meridians. There are specific places where these meridians are located. By inserting needles in these meridians, the flow of energy will become balanced again and heal the body. How Acupuncture Is Performed Tiny needles are inserted just below the skin into specific parts of the body. There may be some discomfort during insertion, but nothing else. Needles may be kept in the body for 20 minutes or so, while you lay comfortably on a table. There shouldn't be any pain when the needles are removed. Many patients feel relaxed or a boost of energy soon after. Chronic pain symptoms can also be treated through acupuncture.
