V1 - 09.01.18 1 of 8 The Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) document will help you choose a health plan.

This is only a summary. For more information about your coverage, or to get a copy of the complete terms of coverage, visit www.umr.com or call 1 -877- 217-7800 . For general definitions of common terms, such as allowed amount , balance billing , coinsurance , copayment , deductible , , or other underline d terms see the Glossary. You can view the Glossary at www.www.umr.com or call 1 -877-217-7800 to request a copy. Important Questions Answers Why This Matters: What is the overall deductible ? Tier One Dignity Health Preferred Network - $0 person / $0 family Tier Two UHC Choice Plus Network - $100 person / $300 family Tier Three Out-of-Network - $1,000 person / $3,000 family Does not appl y to Copayments and services listed below as \"No Charge\" unless noted otherwise in Limitations & Exceptions column. You must pay all the costs up to the deductible amount before this plan begins to pay for covered services you use. Check your policy or plan document to see when the deductible starts over (usually, but not always, January 1st). See the chart starting on page 2 for how much you pay for covered services after you meet the deductible. Are there services covered before you meet your deductible ? Yes. All preventive services defined by the Affordable Care Act are covered without having to pay a copayment or co -insurance or meet a deductible. This applies only when s ervices are delivered by a network provider. A complete list of preventive services can be found at www.healthcare.gov/cove rage/preventive - care-benefits/. Are there other deductible s for specific services? No. You don't have to meet deductibles for specific services, but see the chart starting on page 2 for other costs for services this plan covers. What is the out-of-pocket limit for this plan? Tier One Dignity Health Preferred Network - $4,000 person / $12,000 family (Combined with Tier Two ) Tier Two UHC Choice Plus Network - $4,000 person / $12,000 family (Combined with Tier One ) Tier Three Out-of-Network - $10,000 person / $30,000 family The out-of-pocket limit is the most you could pay during a coverage period (usually one year) for your share of the cost of covered ser vices. This limit helps you plan for health care expenses. Out -of-pocket amounts cross -accumulate between Dignity Health Preferred Network (Tier 1) and UHC Choice Plus Network (Tier 2). What is not included in the out-of-pocket limit ? Penalties, premiums, balance -billed charges, and health care this plan doesn't cover. Even though you pay these expenses, they don't count toward the out-of-pocket limit . Will you pay less if you use a network provider ? Yes. For a list of preferred providers, see www.umr.com. If you are unsure which network list to select, please call 1 -877-217-7800. This plan uses a provider network . You will pay less if you use a provider in the plan's network . You will pay the most if you use an out-of-network provider , and you might receive a bill from a provider for the difference between the provider's charge and wh at your plan pays (a balance billing ). Be aware, your network provider might use an out-of-network provider for some services (such as lab work). Check with your provider before you get services Do you need a referral to see a specialist ? No. You can see the specialist you choose without permission from this plan.
