Approximately 65% of adults in the United State are either overwei ght or obese and projec tions are that this percentage could increase to 75% by 2015. If nothing is done to impact this rate of growth, obesity will likely become the leadi ng preventable cause of death. In the U.S., health care expenditures relate d to obesity and associated medical conditions amount to $100 billion annually and in 2000, obesity was estimated to contribute to approximately 400,000 deaths. Obesity is an epidemic for the general U.S. population. Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI ) constitute 6 to 8% of the U.S. population and during their lifetime these individuals no t only face the challenge of their mental illness but are also affected by a higher prevalence of physical health problems, prominently including overweight and obesity . Overweight and obesity are more prevalent in persons with SMI than in the general population. A combination of factors associated with the mental di sorder itself (e.g., poverty, re duced access to medical care and reduced utilization of appropriate care) as well as other environmental factors (e.g., ready access to calorie dense foods and adve rse effects on some medications can all contribute to the increased body we ight and adiposity in persons with SMI. This is an epidemic within an epidemic. Related in part to the increased prevalence of overweight and obesity as well as other he alth-related risk f actors, persons with SMI have higher rates of morbidity and premature mortality, an d have been estimated to lose between 13 and 30 mean years of potential life expectancy in comparison to the general population. With proper prevention and intervention strategi es, persons with SMI and their healthcare providers can aim to minimize the impact of the various contri buting factors on body weight and on related medical complications that can otherwise reduce life expectancy. The National Association of State Mental Health Program Di rectors' (NASMHPD) Medical Director's Council developed this re port through an information review, expert analyses, and extensive discussions at a tech nical report team meeting held in August 2007. Primary sources of data and information used within this re port were gathered from presentations and commentary from content experts and from the published literature on obesity prevalence, incide nce, and prevention literature. This report addresses the following topics: 1) Obesity within the population of persons with serious mental illness is an epidemic within an epidemic which re quires a public health perspe ctive, including prevention and early intervention across the lifespan; 2) Obesity increases the burden of stigma on persons with serious mental illness; 3) Persons with serious mental illness are motiv ated to lose weight and can successfully lose weight; 4) Interventions to prevent obesity include behavior modification to reduce calorie intake and increase physical ac tivity and avoiding medications with high weight gain risk where possible; 5) Behavioral programs for the treatment of obesity can reduce weight by 15%; Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 3 6) Switching from a high weight gain psychiatric medication to a low weight gain psychiatric medication can result in significant weight loss; 7) Antipsychotic and other psychotropic choi ces should be carefully considered, and switching medications for each individualized patient should be used judiciously because of the potential risks of losing the effectiveness of the antipsychotic medication and increasing troublesome side effects; 8) Adjunctive medications for weight loss ca n reduce weight by 10% but carries some risk; 9) Surgery for weight loss usually results in substantial reductions in weight but only should be resorted to when th ere is clear danger to health and other interventions have failed; 10) Use of practical assessment and monitoring gui delines by behavioral health facilities, mental health clinics, psychiatrists, pres cribers and other members of the treatment team with surveillance data required to be collected, analyzed, and interpreted as appropriate, and reported; 11) Persons with serious mental illness may be excluded or not informed of obesity interventions; and the 12) Obesity in the following subpopulations: a) Children and Adolescents; b) New consumers with serious mental illness; c) Established Consumers; and the d) Elderly. This report makes specific recommenda tions that, when implemented, should substantially reduce the weight and improve the overall heal th of a population with SMI. These recommendations are made at the Nation al, State, and local levels. They should improve the systems that provide care an d treatment to this population. The recommendations are: 1. Encourage research on obesity in people with serious mental illness; 2. Implement national obesity surveillance/mon itoring system for persons with serious mental illnesses; 3. Create federal tax incentives, through the use of employer-sponsored pre-tax medical expense accounts, to enc ourage physical activity; 4. Include weight management interventions and appropriate labo ratory tests as a reimbursable service in existing fe deral healthcare programs; 5. Create a memorandum of understanding (M OU) with NASMHPD and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Systems Admini stration (SAMHSA) on U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) nutritional counseling; 6. Collaborate with federal healthcare agencies on the development of a provider toolkit of best practices for the prevention and re duction of obesity in persons with severe mental illnesses and actively support dissemination of this report in the toolkit through national meetings, Web seminars, c ontinuing education and other available venues; 7. Educate national mental health stakeholde r organizations regard ing the impact of obesity in the populations th ey serve and also about available interventions; Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 4 8. Educate mental health professionals on the importance of weight monitoring and weight reduction in people with serious mental illness; 9. Develop standards of care for mental health providers and work with State Medicaid agencies and other health insurers to ensure that persons with severe mental illness and obesity have access to educational/behavioral, me dication switching, medical, and surgical treatment interventions; 10. Promote opportunities for health care providers, including peer spec ialists, to teach health lifestyles to families, individuals, and older adults; 11. Adopt American Diabetes Association (ADA) and American Psychiatric Association (APA) Second Generation Antipsychotic (S GA) monitoring as a standard of care practice for the population with SMI; 12. Collaborate between the SMHA and the Stat e Health Authority (SHA) to address physical health assessment, health monitoring, and improvement options for the population with SMI; 13. Bridge the collaboration gap between physical and mental health care; 14. Monitor mental health consumers with diab etes and related metabolic risk conditions in mental health clinics; 15. Establish linkages with public health pr ograms and community-based programs in diabetes prevention and control, cardiov ascular disease prevention, and healthy weight management; 16. Offer all consumers preventative intervention strategies targeting weight loss and management; 17. Implement weight control programs that incorporate nutrition, exercise, and behavioral therapy/interventions for persons with serious mental illness. 18. Utilize medications with lower risk of weight gain when possible; 19. Utilize weight loss medication to control weight when medically appropriate, and when other interventions are not feasible or effective; 20. Consult with the patient, and when me dically appropriate, recommend bariatric surgery when all other methods of weight loss have been tried and failed; and 21. Encourage the development of novel appr oaches to educate and support weight control through community programs. The epidemic of obesity in persons with ment al illness is a major cause of morbidity and early death and a significant obstacle to welln ess and recovery that requires immediate action by policy makers, administrators, health care providers, and c onsumers. Effective interventions are available. Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 5 Introduction The National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD) is a 501(c) (3) organization, operating under a co operative agreement with the National Governors' Association (NGA), which repres ents the $29.5 billion public mental health service delivery system serving 6.1 million peop le annually in all 50 states, 4 territories, and the District of Columbia. The Commissioners/Directors of state mental he alth agencies make up the membership of NASMHPD and are those individuals, many of whom are appointed by the Governors of their respective states, responsib le for the provision of mental health servi ces to citizens utilizing the public system of care. There are 220 state operated psychiatric hospitals nationwide and they serve approximately 50,000 patients at any given point in time. Within the structure of NASMHPD are 5 di visions made up of di rectors of special populations/services (Children/Youth/Familie s, Older Persons, Forensic, Legal, and Financing/Medicaid) as well as a Medical Directors Council and formal collaborative relationship with National Association of Consumer/Survivor Mental Health Administrators and State Hospit al Superintendents. The pur pose of these entities is to provide technical assistance and expert c onsultation to the Commissioners/Directors related to issues specific to those populations/services. NASMHPD is uniquely suited to identify, asse ss, and recommend Mental Health policies and best practices. It is the only organiza tion representing the state-level public mental health authorities in every state and territo ry. NASMHPD's members are unique in that they simultaneously represent a broad array of viewpoints - as funde rs of health care, regulators of health care, and direct provide rs of health care - and, must balance the interests of all three viewpoints. NASMHPD and its membership have a proven track record of a bringing together a wide and di verse array of stakeholders to address the complicated issues involved in behavioral h ealth, primary health ca re and public health programming. A number of st akeholders are consistently included in such policy development and implementation endeavors including: primary consumers, family members, advocates, providers , professional organizations, accreditation bodies, federal partners, and sister organizati ons that represent substance a buse, behavioral health, and health. NASMHPD has built coalitions that have succeeded in addressing and moving the field forward on many new programs in cluding co-occurring disorders; the ing cessation; promotion of evidence based practices; mortality related to serious mental illness (SMI); and the integration of mental health with primary care. The NASMHPD Medical Directors Council, wh ich conducts its work under the auspices of the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD), was authorized by the Board of Directors in 1995 and its membership includes medical directors of state mental health author ities from across the country. The NASMHPD Medical Directors Council has developed over 13 technical papers (8 over the past 4 years) addressing key areas of clinical pol icy for the public mental health system including Polypharmacy, Pharmacy Utilizatio n Management, Seclusion and Restraint, Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 6 Prevention and Integrating Primary Care a nd Behavioral Health Systems and Reducing Excess Mortality in Persons with Severe Ment al Illness. These technical papers have guided recent policy changes and practices in the public mental health system. The NASMHPD Medical Directors Council deve loped this fifteenth technical report through a review of materials and extensive discussions at a work group meeting held August 9-10, 2007 in Kansas City, Missouri. Primary sources of data and information used within this report were gathered from presentations and commentary from work group meeting participants, published literatu re on obesity prevalence, incidence, and prevention literature distributed prior to th e meeting, and material s distributed at the meeting. Participants included State Mental Health Authority (SMHA) medical directors and commissioners as well as l eadership from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, Yale University and Connecticut Mental Health Center, the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey/University Behavioral HealthCare, and other technical experts. A complete list of participants is included as Attachment A. The work group reviewed statistics on obesity in both the general population and the population with SMI, current l iterature on obesity and obesi ty prevention, and consulted with experts in mental health a nd obesity prevention activities. Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 7 Definitions American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language defines The Fourth edition of the Obesity , as \"the condition of being obese or increased body weight caused by excessive accumulation of fat .\" While vivid, these definitions are not helpful in actually measuring the accumulation of excess weight. Several methods are available to assess overweight and obesity. The two methods below are practical and easy-to-use and are recommended in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI) expert guidelines on identification, evaluation, and treatment of overweight and obesity in adults: 1. Body Mass Index (BMI) is a practical indicator of the severity of obesity. BMI is a direct calculation based on height and weight, regardle ss of gender and it can be calculated from existing tables (see attachment B). The resulting number is considered a largely reliable indicator of whether a person's weight and adiposity is within a healthy range. The BMI is considered an indi rect measure of body fat or adiposity. BMI does have limitations; for example, BMI can overestimate adiposity in a person who is very muscular and can underestimate body fat in person who have lost muscle mass (i.e., older adults). In adults, BMI's are categorized based on an absolute number according to the classification below: obesity. The predictive value of specific BMI numbe rs for morbidity and mortality risk can vary by ethnicity. For example, BMI criter ia for overweight and obesity in Asian populations, including Indian Asians, has been modified by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and World H ealth Organization (WHO), based on evidence for higher morbidity and mortality risk at lower BMIs in Asian populations, compared to Caucasians for example. Most commonly, the threshold for the definition of overweight in Asian populations is modified to 23 and the threshold for obesity to 25 (compared to 25 and 30, respectively, described above). In children, BMI is routinely interpreted by graphing height and weight on age and gender-specific growth charts. Children's BMI percentiles are thereby calculated describing an individual child 's BMI relative to children of the same age and gender. Using BMI as a public health standard fo r measuring obesity, the NHLBI has issued guidelines on the identification, evaluati on, and treatment of overweight and obese adults. These standards offer solid evidence that the risk for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and other di seases tends to increase progressively as BMI increase Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 8 progressively from values less than to great er than 25. Risk of mortality tends to increase progressively as BMI increases from at least 30. 2. Waist circumference is emerging as a potentially more valid and reliable indicator of central or truncal adiposity and medical risk compared to BMI, with BMI offering no accounting of the true distribution of adiposity acros s body regions (e.g., truncal versus peripheral adiposity). Findings from some studies (Palamara, 2006) have suggested that waist circumference is a be tter predictor of risk for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and other metabo lic risk-related conditions, compared with BMI. While a lack of uniformity about appr opriate abdominal landmarks for the measurement of the \"waistline\" have permeated the research and could undermine the reliability of measurements in clinical practice; the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institut es of Health has issued new guidelines standardizing the measurement of both the waist and hip. To measure waist circumference, locate the upper hip bone and the top of the right iliac crest. Place a measuring tape in a horizontal plane around th e abdomen at the level of the iliac crest. Before reading the tape measure, ensure th at the tape is snug, but does not compress the skin, and is parallel to the floor. The measurement is made at the end of a normal expiration. Waist measurement should be do ne at the iliac crest defined as the narrowest circumference between th e ribs and the umbilicus. Current guidelines suggest that a waist meas urement of greater than 40 inches in men and greater than 35 inches in women is a ssociated with increased cardiometabolic risk. For additional information on waist ci rcumference refer to attachment C. Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 9 Background Trends: \"Obesity is a public health cr isis\" (Wang, 2007). It is a chronic diseas e that has serious health consequences. In the general population rates of obesi ty worldwide and within the United States continue to grow at epidemic ra tes. Worldwide, it is estimated that more than 300 million people are obese (DeMaria, M.D.). Approximately 65% of adults in the United States are either overweight or obese (National Health and Nutrition Survey [NHANES] 1999-2002). Th is percentage has steadily in creased by approximately 40% over the past three decades compared to pr eviously published NHANES data. If the rates of obesity and overweight cont inue at this pace, by 2015, 75% of adults and nearly 24% of U.S. children and adolescents will be overweight or obese (Youfa Wang, 2007). Figure 1.1 below displays the historic trends in the prevalence of obesity by gender and ethnicity from 1971 to 2004. Figure 1.1: U.S. Trends in Ob esity by Gender and 12.5 12.416.8 16.534 20.728.231.1 21.327.9 15.724.4 27.331.6 10152025303540 1971 - 1974 1976 - 1980 1988 - 1994 1999 - 2002 2003 - 2004 Time PeriodPrevalence (%) White, non-hispanic Black, non-hispanic Mexican AmericanWomen 15.4 15.423.330.7 30.2 29.73139.14953.9 26.636.138.442.3 1015202530354045505560 1971 - 1974 1976 - 1980 1988 - 1994 1999 - 2002 2003 - 2004 Time PeriodPrevalence (% ) White, non-hispanic Black, non-hispanic Mexican American Trends in the prevalence of obesity (body mass index 30 kg/m2) in US adults, by gender and ethnicity, National Health and Nutrition Survey, 1971-2004. (Sources: 2, 54). Within the United States, plotted over time , regional differences become apparent. Figure 1.2 below from the Centers for Dise ase Control and Prev ention, displays the regional differences from 1990 to 2005. Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 10 Figure 1.2: U.S. Regional Diffe rences in Obesity Prevalence. Cause: Obesity is a complex, multifactorial, and chronic disease that develops from an interaction of genotype and the environment. According to NHLBI expert consensus, the understanding of how and why obesity develops is incomplete, but involves the integration of social, behavioral, cultural, physiologic, metabolic and genetic factors. And some risk factors are more strongl y linked to specific ethnic groups. There are generally two hallmark behaviors th at account for obesity: too much calorie consumption and too little ca lorie expenditure. Figure 1.3 is a simplified visual representation of the careful balance between caloric intake and output (phys ical activity) to maintain a consistent weight. A shift in ei ther of these can cause an individual to gain or lose weight. Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 11 Figure 1.3: A Careful Balance. Rohan Ganguli, M.D. \u0084 If energy intake = energy expend iture, weight will be stable. \u0084 Excess intake or reduced expenditure = weight gain. \u0084 1 can (12 oz, 150 Kcal) of soda extra per day = +10lb per year. \u0084 Reduced intake or increased expenditure = weight loss. \u0084 30 minutes of brisk walking EVERY DAY (150 cal) = 10 lb weight loss per year. In addition to behaviors there are a variety of other risk fa ctors, such as environmental conditions that affect physic al activities (such as, elev ators & escalator s), genetics, diseases (for example, Cushing's disease or polycystic ovary syndrome), or drugs (such as steroids that can ca use weight gain). Some obesity experts state that we live in an \"obesigenic environment,\" and that declining physical activity and increases in the consumption of energy dense foods (Foods containing more than 225-275 kcal per 100g) is contributing to the rise in weight problems. Side effects of psychotropic me dications can add to this problem. Health Consequences: Researchers indicate that if nothing is done to impact its grow th rate, obesity will likely become the leading preventable cause of deat h. Within the United States, \"obesity has become an epidemic condition\" (DeMaria, M.D.). The U.S. Surgeon General's Call to Action not es that the \"primary concern of overweight and obesity is one of health and not appear ance.\" This increasi ng overweight and obese population is troubling because of the well-esta blished health risks that are associated with these conditions. According to the \"S urgeon General's Call to Action to Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity,\" obesity is connected to an increase in the following health risks: Premature death; Type 2 diabetes; Heart disease; Stroke; Hypertension; Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 12 Gallbladder disease; Osteoarthritis (degeneration or cartilage and bone in joints); Sleep apnea; Asthma; Cancer (endometrial, colon, kidney, gallbladde r, postmenopausal High blood cholesterol; Complications of pregnancy; Menstrual irregularities; Hirsutism (presence of exce ss body and facial hair); Stress incontinence (urine leakage ca use by weak pelvic -floor muscles); Increased surgical risk; Psychological disorders su ch as depression; and Psychological difficulties due to social stigmatization. 1The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recognize being overweight and obesity as chronic diseases , and have published guidelines for the identification and treatment of th ese conditions. As depicted in Figure 1.4, patie nts who are overweight or obes e are at an increased risk of acquiring other serious, po ssibly chronic conditions. Th ese include, but are not limited to hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, mellitus, coronary heart disease, asthma, hypothyroidism, Cushing's s yndrome, obstructive pulmonary disease, emphasema, stroke, as well as multiple forms of cancer and orthopedic problems\" (DeMaria, M.D.; Schnee, 2006). 1 Similar information is available from the National Institute of Health (NIH).

Medical Complications of Obesity Phlebitis venous stasisCoronary heart diseasePulmonary diseaseabnormal Severe pancreatitis Persons with obesity have been found to experience depression more often than non- obese persons (Fagiolini, 2003). Illustrated in figure 1.5 below, individuals with bipolar disorder have been observed to have a shor ter time to recurrence of depression than people with bipolar disorder who were not obese.

Stigmatization: In addition to poorer health and decreased physical functional capaci ty, obese individuals are also limited by social stigma in our soci ety. There is a commonl y held belief of our society that overweight and obese people are lazy and weak-willed. Under this misperception, if overweight persons just ha d willpower, they would push themselves away from the table and not be overweight. This view is unfortunately shared both by some members of the public and even by some health prof essionals charged with caring for these individuals. When persons with obesity who believe th at their health care providers look down upon them, they may not seek necessary medical care (Carr, 2005). People with co-occurring mental illness and obesity may face a \"double whammy:\" stigma associated with the mental illness and stigma related to body weight. While most public health interventions that target persons with obesity focus on their lifestyles and health behavior s, Carr found that interventions should also focus on the practices of \"those who do the discriminating.\" Public edu cation about the distinctive challenges facing obese persons and about th e pervasiveness of pr ejudicial attitudes toward them may help to reduce unfair trea tment of severely overweight Americans. Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 15 Societal Costs: When assessing the economic consequences of obesity, both direct and indirect costs of illness need to be considered. \"Direct costs are the value of resources (personal health care, hospital care, physicans' services, nursing home care, other professional services, and drugs) that could be allocated to other uses in the absence of dise ase. Indirect costs are the value of the lost output because of cessation or reduction of productivity caused by morbidity and mortality\" (Colditz, 1992). Cost-of-illness stud ies have suggested variable estimates of the percentage of total health care costs attri butable to obesity. Prevalence-based cost of illness studies of obesity show that \"aggregate economic costs associated with specific obesity related di seases have demonstrated that the annual burden to society totals in the billions of dollars, representi ng 5.5% to 7.8% of the total health care expenditure in the United States \" (Kortt et al, 1998 citing work completed by Colditz, 1992). \"In the United States, health care expenditure s related to obesity and associated medical conditions amount to $100 billion annually and in 2000, obesity was estimated to contribute to approximately 400,000 deaths. It has been suggested that in the 21st century, increasing rates of obesity may lead to a decline in overall life expectancy in the United States\" (DeMaria, M.D.). Commenting on the impact of obesity in th e workplace, Schmier and colleagues have noted that obese employees use more sick leav e, have higher health care costs and have more workplace injuries (Schmier, et al, 2006). In their report, the Economic Burden of Obesity in Youths Ages 6-17 Years; 1979-1999 published in the May 2002 issue of Pediatrics, Wang, Guijing and Dietz reported that obesity-associated annual hospi tal costs increased from $35 million from the 1979 - 1981 reporting period to $127 million during the 199 7 - 1999 reporting period. Compared to overall costs for discharges, this represents an increase from 0.43% in 1979-1981 to 1.7% in 1997-1999. In another study of overweight children, Hampl and associates found that health care expenditures were significantly higher for obese children when compared to normal weight children (Hampl et al, 2007). Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 16 Special Populations Children and Adolescents: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reports that 9 million children, 16% of the population, within the United States are overweight. According to Youfa Wang, MD, PhD, lead author of a study by research ers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 34% are at risk of becoming overweight in 2003-2004. White children and adolescents had the lowest prevalence of overweight and being at risk of overweight compared with their black and Mexican c ounterparts (Wang, 2007). The Institute of Medicine reports that 24% of African American and Hispanic children are obese. The incidence of overweight children in the United States has steadily increased in the same manner as the adult population over the past decades. Since the 1980's, the estimated percentage of overweight children and adolescents has more than doubled (Schnee, 2006). Excess weight in childhood and adolescence can predict overweight in adults. According to the U.S. Surgeon General's Call to Acti on, overweight adolescents have a 70% chance of becoming overweight or obese adults. Fu rthermore, this problem is intensified by demographic disparities. Low-income 2 to 5 year olds represent 18% of the statewide average number of overweight chil dren (Pennsylvania, 2006). The Institute of Medicine reports that obesity in children places them at risk for serious health complications. Approximately 60% of obe se children in the U.S. had at least one risk factor for cardiovascular disease; 25% ha d two or more risk factors. In the past, physicians considered Type 2 diabetes an adul t affliction that was ra re in children. Now, girls born in the United Stat es in the year 2000 have a 30% lifetime risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. The risk in creases to 40% for boys born in the same year. The risk is even higher for minorities. Some experts have determined that childhood obesity also quickly increases the severity and prevalence of as thma (Pennsylvania, 2006). Obesity in youth has a variety of mental health consequences. The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey reports that obese girls ag es 13 to 14 are four times more likely to experience low self-esteem than non-obese gi rls. An article from the January 2000 publication Pediatrics, entitled \"Childhood Obes ity and Self-Esteem\" reports that obese boys and girls with low self-esteem had higher rates of loneliness, sadness, and nervousness. According to the article these children were more likely to smoke and drink alcohol compared with obese children with normal self-esteem. Depression, often an outcome of low self-esteem, affects as many as 750,000 teens in the U.S. Finally, according to an August 2003 article entitled, \"Associ ations of Weight- Based Teasing and Emotional Well-b eing Among Adolescents,\" from the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine children who were teased about being overweight were more likely to have a poor body imag e, low self-esteem, and symptoms of depression. Twenty-six percent of teens who we re teased at school at home reported they had considered suicide, and 9% had attempted suicide. In the youth population, a higher BMI correlates with victimi zation in younger children and pe rpetration in older youth Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 17 (Janssen, 2004). There is a higher prev alence of disruptive behavior, including Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and chemical dependency. In addition, anxiety disorders, combined with poor social skills ha ve been found to be prevalent (Villa, 2004). Older and Disabled Adults: The percentage of older adults who were obese increased from 16.4% in 1997 to 21.4% in 2002 (Doshi, 2007). Doshi's study of the Medicare population also indicated that this percentage also increased from 32.5% in 1997 to 39.3% in 2002 for the disabled population. Analysis of the data between 1997 and 2002 indicated that the prevalence of obesity among all benefici aries increased by 31%. Doshi's study indicated that the health conse quences of obesity were numerous. In both the aged and disabled groups, obese benefici aries were significantly more likely than normal weight beneficiaries to have one of th e five examined medical comorbidities. The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes was almost th ree times higher in obese aged beneficiaries and two times higher in obese disabled be neficiaries than in their normal weight counterparts. Ninety-three percent obese ag ed and 84.5% of disabled beneficiaries had at least one comorbidity (Doshi, 2007). The prevalen ce of at least one comorbidity among beneficiaries with a BMI 35 was similarly high. In both groups, more than two of five obese beneficiaries and more than half of those with a BMI 35 had three or more of these comorbidities. In addition, almost one-third of obe se aged and two thirds of obese disabled beneficiaries reported fair to poor h ealth. Obese beneficiaries were significantly more likely to report an ADL limitation than normal-weight benefi ciaries in both the aged and disabled groups. Women: Globally, women generally have higher rate s of obesity than men do, although men may have higher rates of being ove rweight. According to the American Obesity Association, 62% of women between 20 and 76 year s are overweight, and 34% are obese.2 Additionally, women are more likely to beco me obese as they age. Obesity among women ages 35 to 64 has increased in prev alence 2% per year from 1960 to 2000. Low- income women in minority populations are most likely to be over weight; black (non- Hispanic) women have the highest prevalence of overweight (78%) a nd obesity (50.8%). Forty to Sixty-Five percent of women re port having sedentary lif estyles, an obvious contributor to obesity. As demonstrated by Figure 1.6 below, wome n, in this large study involving people with schizophrenia, had higher rates of obesity than men and have higher rates of the complications brought by obesity. 2 http://obesity1.tempdomainname.com /subs/fastfacts/obesity_women.shtml Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 18 Figure 1.6: Obesity Rates in Men & Women.

Obese women have four times the risk of osteoarthritis as other wome n. Obese women also have a higher risk for developing breast cance r after menopause. Women who gain more than 45 pounds after reaching adulthood are twice as likely to de velop breast cancer as women who do not gain weight. Similarly, obese women have a significantly higher risk of getting endometrial cancer than non-obese women. For both genders, but particularly for women, higher BMI is correlated with cardiovasc ular disease. Obesity is also the best predictor of gallbladder dis ease for women, where obese wo men have double the risk of women of normal weight. Obesity can impact a woman's ability to have children, and can affect ovulation, fertility treatment success, and pregnanc y rates. Some studies have found that neural tube defects are more frequent among women with higher weight before pregnancy; obesity also carries a higher risk of pregnancy hypertension, gestational diabetes, urinar y infection, and Cesarean s ection delivery. Obese women thought to be infertile actually have higher rates of successful pregnancy terms, longer labors, and induced labor. While all obese people experience stigma a nd discrimination, obese women experience this significantly more than obese men; for those women who reduce obesity through surgery, unemployment rates fall from 84 to 64%.4 The societal importance placed on thinness as a measure of beauty can make establishing and maintaining relationships more difficult for obese women. 3 http://obesity1.tempdomainname.com /subs/fastfacts/obesity_women.shtml http://obesity1.tempdomainname.com /subs/fastfacts/obesity_women.shtml 4 Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 19 Racial/Ethnic Groups: The American Obesity Association states that in comparison to white Americans, minority populations such as African Ameri cans and Hispanic Americans have higher rates of obesity, whereas Asian Americans show relatively low levels of obesity.5 African Americans cultu ral dynamics associated with f ood choices, physical activity, and cultural norms around excess weight can play a role in failed weight loss. Generally, African Americans get less exer cise than white populations, particularly among women. American Indian and Alaska Native populati ons show particularly high rates of being overweight or obese; over 30% are obese, an d among those ages 45 to 77 years, that number increase to over 39% for men and 43% for women.6 The American Obesity Association reports that, \"44 to 60 percen t of Native American men report having sedentary lifestyles, an obvious contributor to obesity.\" With regard to gender, black women (51%) and Mexican American men (30%) have the highest rates of obesity.7 Overall, lower socioeconomic status populations have a much higher likelihood of being obese. Specifi cally, women and minorities of lower socioeconomic status are affected by obesity at higher rates. 5 http://obesity1.tempdomainname.com/s ubs/fastfacts/Obesity_Minority_Pop.shtml 6 http://www.americanheart.org/downloada ble/heart/1014745957045FS02AM02WEB.pdf http://obesity1.tempdomainname.com/s ubs/fastfacts/Obesity_Minority_Pop.shtml 7 Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 20 Persons with Serious Mental Illness Adult persons with a serious mental illness (SMI ) are the core focus of this report and can be defined as those aged 18 years or older with a diagnosable mental disorder that is so long lasting and severe that it se riously interferes w ith their ability to take part in major life activities. Accord ing to the 2004 U.S. Census, a bout 1 in 17 adults suffer from a serious mental illness. Illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder affect an estimated 8.1 million American adults yearly (NIMH, 2006). During their lifetime these individuals not only face the challenge of their mental illness but are also affected by a higher prevalence of physical health problems, such as obesity. Obesity is more prevalent in persons with SMI than in the general population (Hoffman, 2005). A study by Strassnig, Brar, and Gangu li, published in 2003 in the Schizophrenia Bulletin reviewed 276 patients with schi zophrenia in Pittsburgh and found that: 19% were of normal weight with a BM I within the range of 19 to 25; 22% were overweight with a BMI within the range of 25 to 30; and 59% were obese with a BMI greater than 30. Several other studies have addressed the prevalence of obesity in the population of patients with severe mental illn ess such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Allison et al (1999) found that 42% of a group of indivi duals with schizophrenia had a BMI of 27 or greater, compared to 27% of the general population. In that study, the difference was mostly due to the high propor tion of women with schizophr enia who are obese. In another study (Homel, 2002), women with schizophrenia had higher mean BMI's compared with non-psychiatric controls whereas men with schizophrenia were similar to controls. In the Northern Finland 1966 cohort study, ra tes of abdominal obesity and metabolic syndrome in patients with schizophrenia were 42% and 19.4%, respectively, as compared to health members of the cohort, which were 13% and 6%, respectively (Saari et al., 2006). In the same study, the probability of changing from underweight or normal during adolescence to overweight or obese in a dulthood was 3.01 in females, and 2.24 in males as compared to the healthy members of the cohort. Physical inactivity and high alcohol consumption were the common risk factors fo r both sexes (Hakko et al, 2007). Another recent study found that the prevalence of ove rweight, obesity, and diabetes mellitus were significantly higher in patients with severe mental illness (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder and major depressi ve disorder) as compared to those in the Kentucky adult general population (Susce et al., 2005). The odds ratio for overweight was 1.7 and the odds ratio for obesity was 2.6. The results were particularly worrisome since Kentucky is one of the states with th e highest prevalence of overweight people. Keck et al (2004) reviewed 45 studies of patients with bipolar disorder and found that the results of these studies indicated that the overall prevalence of overweight and obesity was higher in these patients than in control populations. Several risk factors for weight gain and obesity in patients with bipolar di sorder were identified: excessive carbohydrate consumption, low rate of exercise, and treatment with medications associated with weight gain. In the 1460 patient CATIE study, the prevalence of metabo lic syndrome among Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 21 patients with chronic schiz ophrenia was 36% for males and 52% for females as opposed to the rates in general popul ation, which were 20% and 25% respectively. In the same study mean BMI for females was 33 and for ma les was 29 kg/m\u00b2; the rates for abdominal obesity were 73% for males 37% for females as compared to 57% and 25% respectively in the US population (McEvoy et al. 2005). In the CATIE study, obesity was associated with significantly increased outpatient medical costs (25% more), even after controlling for demographic characteristics and medical comorbidity (Chwastiak et al, 2006). A recent study of schizophrenia patients conducted in the state of Connecticut revealed an overweight rate of 78% vs. 58.2% in the population, and an obesity rate of 59% vs. 20.1 % in the population (See figure 2.0 below).

Additional studies indicate that th e risk of obesity in persons with SMI vary by diagnosis. Those with: 8 Depression have a 1.2 to 1.8 increased likelihood of being obese; 9 and Bipolar disorder have a 1.5 to 2.3 increased likelihood of being obese; 10 Schizophrenia have a 3.5 incr eased likelihood of being obese. A combination of the mental disorder itself and some of the medications used to treat it, a sedentary lifestyle, poor nutri tion, overeating, smoking and subs tance abuse, irregular and inadequate sleep, lack of access to adequate medical care, includi ng poor coordination of 8 Simon GE et al.

Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 22 care between multiple providers, and lack of access to nutrition and exercise programs have contributed to increased weight gain in persons with SMI (Hoffman, 2005). Studies suggest that persons with SMI tend to have a diet consisting of an increased quantity and caloric intake, diet composition - consuming foods low in fibe r, high in fat, with fewer fruits and vegetables primarily because of elevated rates of poverty in this population.11 In addition, inactivity among persons with SM I tend to contribute to rates of obesity. Studies indicate that the odds of inactivity in persons with SMI vary by diagnosis. Those with: 12 Severe mental illness have a 1.5 incr eased likelihood of being inactive; 13 Bipolar disorder have a 3.2 incr eased likelihood of being inactive; and 14 Depression have a 2.0 increased likelihood of being inactive. Persons with SMI have higher rates of morbidity and premature mortality compared with the general population. As stated earlier, obesity risk factors can contribute to the increased morbidity and mortality. Research suggest that \"this population loses...13 to over 30 years of life compared with their nonpsychiatric cohorts\" (Vreeland, 2007). The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) has identified that persons with SMI are at a greater risk of developing adult onset, or Type 2 diabetes (Duckworth, 2007). This type of diabetes can sometimes be prevente d by exercise and healthy eating habits, and maintaining normal body weight, but takes aw areness and motivation on behalf of the individual. Usually, many risk factors combine, leading to a slowly developing problem. These risk factors include: Biological/Genetic: There is some evidence that individuals wi th some psychiatric conditions may have a higher genetic risk of developing diabetes. Antipsychotic medications, including some second generation antipsychotics, carry a risk of weight gain, a major contributor of diabetes. Not all antipsychotics, however, confer the same relative risk. Antipsyc hotics commonly cause sedation, predictably leading to reduced caloric expenditure, and some medications may also reduce satiety or increase hunger, causing some people to lo se the feeling of fu llness they used to get at the end of an ordinarily sufficient m eal. The magnitude of these effects varies across individual medications, for exampl e with medications that have more histamine type 1 receptor antagonism havi ng larger adverse effects on body weight. In addition, some psychotropic medications may directly alter insulin sensitivity or lipid metabolism, contributing to insulin re sistance or dyslipidemia, risk factors for hyperglycemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. 11 Strassnig, Brar and Ganguli.

Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 23 Negative symptoms and co-occurring depres sion may reduce people's motivation to eat well or be physically active, thereby further increasing for obesity and conditions related to obesity. A family history of type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and ca rdiovascular disease appears to further add to the risk. Cultural/Societal: The culture surrounding mental health has historically a nd traditionally encouraged passivity. Providers have reinforced the idea that mental health consumers should take their meds, get a ride or take a bus to their program, and sit in groups. Diabetes prevention, however, is about action: walki ng to an appointment, participating in community recreational activitie s, playing a sport, danci ng, incorporating some form of physical activity into your daily schedule along with careful monitoring of food choices. Psychiatrists and other professionals may be reluctant to address weight and ways to possibly prevent weight gain for fear that the individual will refuse to take the medications that may have weight gain as a potential side effect. Clinicians often have insufficient training and may feel too pressed for time to focus on lifestyle choices and thus often focus on more traditiona l psychiatric goals such as reducing symptoms, leaving lifestyle choices to the individual. However, dialogue between the provider and the consumer about healthy lifestyle choices may help to inspire and motivate a person to make healt hy choices (such as be ing more physically active and making healthier food and bevera ge choices. This may prevent or minimize weight gain and its secondary medical complications.) Psychiatrists and other clinicians have lim ited time available to spend with a person during an office visit. Con cerns about the liability of the doctors managing medical problems can arise, which may result in an individual not getting timely treatment for a potential medical problem. New concer ns may arise around li ability related to prescribing psychotropic medications with large weight gain profiles. People with SMI often receive fragmented or poor medical care, which increase the time and effort to identify a problem and manage it. Furthermore, barriers to receiving prompt and appropriate physical he alth care include the difficulties faced by all consumers in accessing and negotiating the complexities of our present health care system. Mental health worker attitudes may contribute to the risk. These attitudes include the belief that one of the few pleasures a person receives is from eating. Low socio-economic status can cause financ ial barriers. Litt le money can limit choices. For example, high calorie foods , such as fast food are normally less expensive than healthier altern atives such as fresh fruits and vegetables. In addition, items like sugar-containing soft drinks are usually cheaper than healthier alternatives such as low-fat milk. Packaged foods, high in sodium and sugar, are also less expensive than fruits and vegetables, have a longer shelf life, and are easier to prepare for individuals with limited food prepara tion experience and for those living alone where the social activ ity of healthy dining with othe rs is not routine. Group home and congregate care housing providers, often conscious of costs and ease of preparation may also opt for less nutritious foods. Nutritional counseling is rarely Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 24 covered by Medicaid. Health club fees can be expensiv e, and some people find going to gyms intimidating. As risk factors accumulate, the relative risk of cardiovascular disease increases significantly. As illustrate d by Figure 2.1, risk factors su ch as abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and hypertension can have at least additive effects on risk.

Contrary to this common belief, persons with SMI ar e self-conscious about their weight and interested in reducing their weight. A study of 143 patients with SMI in Pittsburgh indicates that over 71% believe that they ar e overweight and over 50% have tried to lose weight (Figure 2.2). In addi tion, the study found that there was a correlation between the more a patient weighed and the desire to lose weight. Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 25 Figure 2.2: Patients' Attitudes About Their Weight - (60.1, n=86) Believe that they are overweight Want to weigh less than current weight Have tried to lose w eig ht A survey of 2,222 patients in the United Kingdom conducted by the British National Schizophrenia Fellowship (MI ND) and the National Associat ion for Mental Health & Manic Depression found that the top five \"bad things\" about taking psychotropic medications to manage ones mental illness were: Weight gain, eat a lot, etc. identifi ed by approximately 20% of responders; Sedating side effects, tiredness, and drowsiness, identified by approximately 15% of responders; Lethargic, demotivated, less active, and ap athetic, identified by more than 5% of responders; Imprecise negative comments, identified by more than 5% of responders; and Tremors and shaking indentified by slight ly more than 5% of responders. These concerns can contribute to medication non-adherence unless mitigated. \"While the body of evidence is not as vast as that in the general population, studies have shown that people with SMI can adopt health y lifestyle behaviors. Despite the known health risks intrinsically associ ated with mental illness, research indicates that, like those without mental illness, people with schizophr enia, bipolar disorder, and other types of mental illness can adopt healthie r choices (Vreeland, 2007).\" Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 26 Interventions The impact on one's overall health even with modest weight loss, are considerable. According to a study by Gregg and Williams on published in 2004, which analyzed data from 7 randomized controlled trials of approximately 7,000 subjects over 1 to 6 years lost 2 to 6% of body weight lost through lifestyle intervention. Th is modest amount of weight loss results was associated with: Decreased the hypertension incidence by 20 to 40%; Decreased diabetes incidence by 30 to 60%; and Decreased cardiac events by 30 to 40%. Additional studies have reported that moderate weight loss of: 4 to 5% loss can lower or eliminate the n eed for antihypertensive medication in adults & the elderly (Stamler, 1987; Langford, 1985; Whelton, 1998); 5 to 7% loss is associated with 58% redu ced risk for type 2 diabetes in adults (Knowler, 2002); 6 to 7% loss can improve the metabolic syndrome by decreasing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, LDL concentra tion, and fasting insulin (Brook, 2004); and 10% loss can reduce lifetime risk for heart disease up to 4% and increase life expectancy for up to 7 months (Oster, 1999). Figure 3.1: Hennekens CH.

Reducing Calories Is Much More Effective at Losing Weight Than Increasing Physical Activity. Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 27 Exercise independent of improvements in diet, can lead to additional metabolic improvements. It is important to note that psycho-education, lifestyle interventions mu st be based on consumer choice. Behavioral treatment professionals need to help individu als with psychiatric disabilities understand health consequences of lifestyle choices and build a clinical alliance supporting any patient chosen therapeu tic interventions. Sh ared decision making in clinical settings becomes critical to re inforcing the ability of individuals with psychiatric disabilities to make healthy choices. Increasing Physical Activity Is Effective for Impr oving Physical Health Independent of Any Change in Weight. Prevention of obesity in non-obese individu als is a key primary prevention goal and various combinations of diet, exercise, and be havioral treatment can also help to prevent continued weight gain and foster weight lo ss when weight gain has already occurred. These interventions also have promising i ndications of reducing weight in overweight and obese individuals with SMI. Public Health Interventions: In response to the obesity epidemic, in 2005, th e United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) updated their Dietary Guidelines for Americans and now promote a new food guidance system for Americans. MyPy ramid replaces the old Food Pyramid as represented in Figure 3.3. Figure 3.3: Old and New Food Pyramid. 2005: The USDA Updates the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and Unveils a New Food Guidance System Old Food Pyramid New MyPyramid As depicted in MyPyramid, the USDA incorpor ated, for the first time, regular physical activity (a minimum of 30 minutes a day). By doing so, the USDA has acknowledged Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 28 that physical activity is an essential element when combin ed with a healthy diet in maintaining a healthy weight. The eating plan emphazised is one that will give the body the balanced nutrition it needs for eating a variety of nutrient packed foods everyday. These eating patterns are not \"fad diets,\" but rather a lifestyle of health eating that promotes well-being and reduces the risk of many chronic illnesses linked to obesity. MyPyramid has 12 different versions: calor ic intake and recommended servings for different food groups will differ depending upon age, gender, and physical activity level (Dietary Guidelines and MyPyramid Mini-Poster). In addition, the National Weight Control Re gistry, which is a registry of over 6,000 individuals who have been successful in losing a minimum of 30 pounds and keeping the weight off for at least a year , suggests six key strategies wh en helping people lose weight and keeping it off: 15 1. Engage in high levels of physical activity; 162. Eat a diet low in calories and fat; 173. Eat breakfast; 184. Self-monitor weight regularly; 195. Maintain a consistent eating pattern; 206. Catch slips before they turn into larger regains; 217. Watch a limited amount of television; 228. Initiate weight loss after a medical event; and 239. Eat a diet with limited va riety in all food groups. Behavioral Treatment: \"According to the guidelines of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), treatment of overweight or obe se adults is a two-step pr ocess involving assessment and treatment management. Assessment includes assessing BMI, diet, waist circumference, risk status, and level of mo tivation (NHLBI, 1998).\" Life style modification programs are typically heavily influenced by learning theory and, principles of classical and operant conditioning. To remain atheorectical and pragmatic, these programs often incorporate strategies like cognitive restructuring to induce behavior change from cognitive- behavioral therapy. The key elements to behavioral approaches are giving participants a set of structured, gradual lifesty le change principals and met hods in order to modify diet and physical activity, cognitive techniques for attitude change, and strategies for increasing social support. Thus the interven tions both attempt to provide self-knowledge of where the problem behaviors originat e, and teach skills for changing them. 15 Klem, M.L. et al. (2003). Am J Clin Nutr.

Therapies that combine modifications to diet, behavior management, and physical activity are the most successful at obtaining weight lo ss.

Ayyad and Andersen, 2000. There is emerging evidence that behavioral treat ments that were shown to be effective in non-mentally ill individuals appear to be eff ective for individuals with severe mental illness as well. O'Keefe et al. (2003) perf ormed a retrospective chart review of 35 Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 30 patients who had initially gained at least 20 lbs. and then lost at le ast 10 lbs. while taking antipsychotics over a 5 year period. The most frequent weight loss interventions were regular dietician visits (42.9%), self-directed diet (28.6%), and weight loss as a treatment goal (25.7%). There are no less than fifteen publ ished clinical intervention trials that confirmed the effectiveness of a wide range of behavioral interven tions from lifestyle change to commercial Weight Watchers program. A summary of these interventions are presented in the Table 3.5. Table 3.5.

Psychiatrists and primary care physicians throughout the United States caring for patients with mental illn ess living in the community were provided with enrollment forms and asked to distribute them to the targ et population. Patients we re not required to meet any enrollment criteria, in cluding diagnosis, treatment, weight, or risk for weight gain. Selection of participants was at the sole discretion of the clinician, and the decision to enroll belonged entirely to the patient. Participants completed an enrollment survey that queried the self-perceived need to improve overall health and well- being; eat healthier; improve fitness, stress management, and sleep habits; and increase self-esteem. Part icipants' readiness to change eating habits and to start being more physically active was also assessed. Information on diet and exercise preferences from the enrollment survey was used to generate a personalized menu planner that included a weekly menu w ith dinner recipes and shopping list, which was developed with the assistance of mental health clinicians and registered dietitians. A Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 31 public health clinician and a certified health fitness instructor developed a personalized exercise plan. Participants also receiv ed regular educational mailings, such as newsletters that were developed by health care professionals, monthly motivational progress updates, motivationa l progress updates, and motivational gifts, like exercise videos. The results of the study of this program found that the participants who were motivated to make a change were able to make healthy li festyle changes, which helped them to lose weight and gain self-confiden ce. The success of these i ndividuals was significantly associated with their readiness to make lifesty le changes. And the results are consistent with those of a prospective naturalistic study in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were motivated to change their behavior in order to lose weight and benefited from a we ight control program that focused on nutrition, exercise and motivation. There is also a Solutions for Wellness manua lized program (Vreeland B., Toto A.M., and Sakowitz M., 2008). It is a free, easy-to -use psychoeducational wellness program designed to inspire and assist persons with mental illness to make healthier eating, physical activity, and other lifestyle factor choices. Research findings suggest that the program is significantly associated with we ight control in peopl e with schizophrenia (Littrell et al., 2003) and also in people with other serious mental illnesses (Vreeland et al., 2008). Additionally, other similar progra ms such as the Healthy Living program assist with weight reduction. The Hea lthy Living program was designed to assist individuals who had gained wei ght as a result of their medi cations to make long-lasting lifestyle and behavioral change s that would have a positive effect on weight loss, overall health, and well-being. Healthy Living consisted of nutritional counseling, exercise, and behavioral interventions designed to help adults with schizophrenia implement healthy life style changes. Behavioral strategies included self-monito ring of eating and physical activity, stress management, stimulus control, problem so lving, and social support. Stage-based motivational counseling strategies (see table 3.6 below) were utilized and the participants were encouraged to make healthier choices around food and physical activity. Select materials from the Solutions for Wellness pr ogram (mentioned above) were utilized. \"Small steps\" that could fit into the individual's every day lifestyle (taking into account the challenges that people with serious mental illness may encounter) were encouraged.

Amer Psychologist, 47: 1102-1114 Results from the Healthy Living study not only suggest that people diagnosed with schizophrenia can lose more weight than t hose who receive usual psychiatric care, but that they also may be able to lose more weight than th eir non-psychiatric cohorts who participate in weight loss programs such as Adkins and Weight Watchers (Vreeland, 2007). Potential benefits to the patient from weight loss include: Reduction in risk of diabetes, cardiovasc ular disease, and other obesity related illnesses; Reduction of serum triglycerides and to tal and Increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol c oncentrations; and Reduction in blood glucose concentrations and in hemoglobin A1C among patients with type 2 diabetes. The Small Changes (Small Steps) Approach to Weight Management: Some experts recommend using a \"small cha nges approach\" to prev enting & Wyatt H.R., 2006; Vreeland, 2007). A combination of reduced energy intake (food) and incr eased physical activity that equals 100 kcal/day should prevent weight gain in most adults. A small changes approach can be applied to individuals or a population. Several examples of \"small steps\" people could choose to achieve this appear below. Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 33 Reducing consumption of any foods can result in substantial weight loss within a year. For instance: Elimination one 12-ounce can of soda per da y can result in reduction of between 10 and 16lbs; Switching from whole milk to 2% (served three times per day) c a n r e s u l t i n a reduction of 5.6lbs; Refusing larger sizes can reduce about 500 calories; Watching TV two hours less per day can resu lt in a 23% decrease in obesity; and Walking 2,000 steps (or about 1 mile) every day may reduce an additional 10 lbs. (Consider pedometers as a safe and easy way to increase awareness about physical activity and add more steps to each day). Diabetes Prevention Program: Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) is a very large NIH sponsored trial that have shown a behavioral lifestyle interven tion is very effective in decr easing rates of diabetes and other obesity related morbidit y in non-mentally ill individuals (Knowler et al., 2002, Hamman et al., 2006). DPP has been shown to be effective for mentally ill individuals as well (McKibbin et al., 2006). All the manua ls and materials of the DPP are freely available on the internet from the NIH, and can be adapted by mental health professionals for use in severe mentally ill population24. Psychiatric Medications: Psychotropic medications are known to contribu te to overweight and obesity.

For patients starting antipsychotics, a prescriber should consid er the patients baseline BMI when choosing medications and choose medications with lowered risk of exacerbating obesity in overweight individuals or those at risk for obesity. In additi on, for patients with high or borderline values or in patients with fam ily history of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease or st roke, drugs with lower risk of metabolic side effects should be chosen.

Practice standards have been developed for monitoring the metabolic consequences of anti-psychotic medication incl uding weight gain. These pr actice standards are outlined within figure 3.10 below. The regular mon itoring of fasting lip id profiles is now recommended as a result of an increased und erstanding of the re lationship between the level of certain lipid fractions and risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. While the ADA Consensus statement suggested that fasting lipid profiles might only need to be monitored every 5 years after an initial year of treatment, this reco mmendation is in fact derived from U.S. Public Health Service (U SPHS) guidelines for indi viduals at low risk for cardiovascular disease, with wide agreement since that time that this is not a low risk population. In addition, lipid fract ions like plasma triglyceride can serve as an indicator of insulin resistance, and can be elevated long before changes in plasma glucose, giving providers and patients a chance to intervene before disease progression and tissue damage occurs. The value of scr eening and monitoring can no t be overemphasized, since intervention efforts require knowledge of th e level of risk for an individual. Recent evidence indicates very low levels of scr eening and monitoring of plasma glucose and even lower levels for plasma lipids in patients taking antipsychotic medications (Morrato et al., 2008).

However, since not all patients benefit or are harmed equally during treatment with individual antipsychotic medications, it is ne cessary to carefully consider trade-offs involving individual drug res ponse and individual patient risk factor s and preferences. This should optimally occur as an ongoing, shared, decision-making process between individual patients and their prescribers, re-evaluated on an ongoing basis as risks and benefits emerge. If a patient is taking multiple psychotropics, further attention may be necessary to determine risks, benefits and alternatives especially if the patient is gaining weight. Monitoring protocols for all individuals taking antipsychot ic medications should include the following: Personal/family history; Weight (BMI); Waist circumference; Blood pressure; Fasting glucose; and Fasting lipid profile. Weight Loss Medications: While some individuals with SMI are able to maintain normal weight through diet and exercise, many are not able to avoid obesity. An important principle for this population is expressed in the USPHS guidelines targeti ng prevention of cardiovascular disease, the Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 39 National Cholesterol Education Program and the Adult Treatment Panel (now ATP III) guidelines from the National Heart Lung a nd Blood Institute (NHL BI). Adjunctive pharmacotherapy to lower risk, using drugs of proven benefit (e.g., lipid lowering agents), can be an important approach to lo wer risk when therapeutic lifestyle change (TLC) has failed, or when risk levels are sufficiently elevated to warrant pharmacological intervention without waiting for the results of TLC. However, when secondary causes of risk (e.g., adverse effects of antip sychotics, protease inhibitors or glucocorticoids on lipid levels) are identified, efforts to address th ese secondary causes should first be made whenever clinically possible. If secondary cau ses of risk can be removed, risks and costs associated with adjunctive pharmacotherapy can be minimized. When determining if drug therapy is appropriate fo r the treatment of obesity, th e clinician should understand that drug therapy is not indicated until afte r all non-pharmacological attempts of weight loss have failed, excluding bariatric surger y. Pharmacotherapy is not indicated and should never be used as first line therapy for the treatment of obesity. The National Heart, Blood, and Lung Institute (NHLBI) 25 has indicated that medication treatment for obesity should be rese rved as adjunct therapy to diet and physical activity for overweight and obese patients. Additionally, drug therapy may have more risks for people with serious mental illness, related in part to m echanisms of action for specific agents, with almost no currently available long term safety data for any agent in the SMI population. Therefore any adjunctive drug therapy for the treatment of obesity should be administered under the close supervision of a medical professional. Medical professionals should monitor adherence to th e plan, side effects and potential effects when combined with the drugs used to treat the person's mental illness. According to Bray, to use pharmacological treatment properly for the treatment of obesity, it is important to start w ith the following framework in mind: Obesity is due to an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure; Drugs can either reduce food intake or increase energy expenditure; Drug treatment does not cure the overweight patient; The therapeutic range of medications for pr actitioners is limited to only a few drugs; The use of drugs labors under the nega tive halo of treatment mishaps; Drugs do not work when they are not taken; when the drugs are stopped weight gain is the expected outcome; Weight loss plateaus during continued treatment when compensatory mechanisms come into play to counterbala nce the effect of the drug; Monotheraphy usually produces wei ght loss in the range of 10%; Frustration with the failure to continue to lose weight often lead s to discontinuation of therapy and then to weight regain with labeling of the drug as a failure. 26The NHLBI recommends pharmacological treat ment in patients with a BMI 30 or a BMI 27 with at least two risk factors. According to Schn ee, with any of the current medications available for long- term treatment and maintenan ce, a patient can achieve at best a 10% reduction in weight from baseline with strict adherence to the medication and 25 As well as the National Institute for Health.

Presently, three classes of prescription medi cations have FDA approval for weight loss in the United States are: Noradrenergic agents (phentermine); Adrenergic and noradrenergic agents and the adrene rgic and serotonergic agents exert their affects by decreasing appetite while increasing satiety. Lipase inhibitors exert their affects by decreasing nutrient absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in weight loss. Medications without FDA approval that have been used for weight loss include: Metformin - an oral insulin sensitizing agent indicated for - and zonisimide - oral anticonvulsants; and Buproprion - an oral antidepressant. (See attachment E for more information.) Adjunctive Medications to Reduce Weig ht for persons with Schizophrenia: Weight loss and other types of adjunctive medications have been utilized to try to reduce weight in people with schiz ophrenia. Figure 3.12 below i ndicates, rather small and non- definitive studies that have utilized adjunc tive medication to reduce weight in persons with schizophrenia. A recent Cochrane review of adjunctive pharmacological interventions to lower weight or prevent wei ght gain in patients w ith SMI suggested that currently published resu lts do not identify any well-characterized agents with consistent beneficial and well-tolerated effects. For example, it remains unclear whether reported favorable effects of metformin on weight in this population are related to insulin sensitization or simply adverse gastrointestin al (GI) drug effects that make patients want to eat less. (The indu ction of unpleasant adverse GI e ffects is probably not a preferred approach to weight reduction in any population). Furthermore, the safety of weight loss medications in the population with SMI has not been established. Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 41 Figure 3.12: Adjunctive Medication to Re duce Weight in Schizophrenia Patients. From: Strassnig & Ganguli (2007). Clinic al Schizophrenia and related Psychoses. Risk factors associated with this method of weight loss include, but are not limited to additional side effects and an increased cost to one's health. Furthermore, while utilizing a combination of the various medications is possible, more study is needed in this area to determine the multiplicative affects of taking tw o or more medications. Limited research Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 42 in this area suggests that beha vioral interventions are just as, if not more effective, in people with schizophrenia, and are also safe r. Importantly, the removal of secondary causes of increased weight (e.g., therapeutic su bstitution of antipsychotics with lower risk for weight gain for agents with higher ri sk) can produce even larger weight lowering effects than behavioral interventions or ad junctive medication (see, for example, figure 3.11). However, adjunctive medication could be considered if a combination of diet, exercise, and behavioral interventions fail, and when psychotropic medication switching opportunities are limited due to patients alread y being on lower risk drugs or switching medications is psychiatrically unfeasible. Th ese risks and potential benefits of any of these course s should be weighed with the consumer in determ ining an appropriate course of action. exercise and ehavior modification in addition to pharmacotherapy (Palamara, 2006).\" \"Evidence-based medicine dict ates that effective obesity management must incorporate an integrated program of caloric and fat restriction in combination with b Surgery: For morbid obesity, bariatric surgery is a highly effective therapy, although efficacy and tolerability have received limited formal tes ting in the SMI population.

This list is recognized to be lim ited in its scope as it does not include every conclusion and recommendation made within th e body of this report; however, it does represent those priorities determined at the meeting for obesity prevention efforts for individuals with SMI focused specif ically on the following three levels: National - through NASMHPD; State - through the State Ment al Health Authority; and Community Mental Health Center and other providers. Furthermore, it is recognized that for th e greatest success coordination must occur between all of these levels. Recommendations at the National Level include: 1.1: Encourage research on obesity in peop le with serious mental illness. Better data is needed on the prevalence of obesity in people with serious mental illnesses, in order to identify high-r isk groups, including women, children, the elderly and ethnic/racial minorities. There have been few randomized and controlled clinical trials studying obesity and its management in people with serious mental illness; more st udy of this population is necessary. 1.2: Implement national obesity surveillance/monitoring system for persons with serious mental illnesses. Develop and implement community programs for weight monitoring in all people with SMI, weight maintenance among those persons wi th SMI who are in the normal weight category and weight loss for those who are overweight or obese. Surveillance of the overall health status of persons with serious mental illnesses should include continued monitoring of we ight, BMI, waist circumference, fasting blood sugar (FBS), lipids, and the affect s of pharmaceuticals on the weight of the individuals in the SMI population. NAS MHPD should partner with SAMHSA and other federal agencies to devel op and disseminate specialized programs tailored at weight reduction for persons with SMI who are overweight or obese. Education and counseling should be tailored for persons with SMI to ensure that persons with normal weight do not become overweight or obese. 1.3: Create federal tax incentives, th rough the use of employer-sponsored pre-tax medical expense accounts, to encourage physical activity. Federal tax policy can be used to promot e health and healthy activities. For individuals who are employed and able to participate in pre-ta x spending accounts Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 46 for medical expenses, dues and fees for me mbership to a local gym or local Park and Recreation Center could be included as a valid expense for reimbursement. Such expense reimbursement can create financial incentives for pursuing and adopting physical activity into one's lifestyle. For those individuals who do not have th e ability to participate in pre-tax spending accounts for medical expenses; a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the local Park and Recreati on Department is a strong possibility. The MOU could delineate the criteria necessary to be eligible for reduced membership fees. 1.4: The Centers for Medicaid and Medica re Services should include weight management interventions and appr opriate laboratory tests as a reimbursable service in existing federal healthcare programs. NASMHPD should encourage the Centers fo r Medicaid and Me dicare Services (CMS) to cover weight management inte rventions and corresponding lab tests to establish a comprehensive weight loss program for individuals with serious mental illnesses. Such interventions should include psychoeducational and behavioral interventions, pedometers, s cales, medications for weight loss, and surgery. Furthermore, as weight loss me dications are studied for release, the FDA should study the effects these medications have on persons with SMI. 1.5: Create a MOU with NASMHPD a nd SAMHSA on USDA nutritional counseling. Dietary consultations are an effective inte rvention to prevent and reduce obesity. Dietary consultations are an available re source for primary care and psychiatric professionals to utilize for persons with SMI. Accessing USDA nutritional counseling will benefit persons with SMI while conserving public mental health system resources. 1.6: Federal Healthcare agencies should collaborate on the development of a provider toolkit of best practices fo r the prevention and reduction of obesity in persons with severe ment al illnesses and actively support dissemination of this report in th e toolkit through national meetings, Web seminars, continuing educat ion and other available venues. NASMHPD, SAMHSA, NIH and other fe deral agencies should assess the efficacy and utility of available strategies for the prevention and reduction of obesity in people with serious mental il lness and create a 'toolkit' of best practices for providers. Once devel oped, this toolkit should be widely disseminated, using a variety of strategies. 1.7: Educate national mental health st akeholder organizations regarding the impact of obesity in the populations they serve and also about available Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 47 interventions. Reducing this epidemic of obesity and subsequent mortality will require support of and actions by the broader community of public mental health stakeholders. Provider groups such as the National C ouncil of Community Be havioral Health (NCCBH) and the American Psychiatric A ssociation and advocacy groups such as Mental Health America and the National Al liance for the Mentally Ill need to be informed of this reports findings and involved in implementing it's recommendations. Recommendations at the State Level, to be implemented through the State Mental Health Authority include: 2.1: Educate mental health professi onals on the importance of weight monitoring and weight reduction in people with serious mental illness. Behavioral health care professionals are often not trained to assess and address physical health care issues and some clin icians may still believe that persons with SMI are not able to live healthy lifestyles, due to a variety of factors, including: The belief that obesity is related to the person's mental illness; The belief that people with SMI lack th e motivation to improve their health and well-being; The socioeconomic challenges of living with a SMI; Discrimination and stigma; The difficulty in accessing good-quality medical care for people with SMI; and The high prevalence of weight gain as a side effect in mental health medications. Education about weight management and reduction can help to overcome these factors. Providers need to be encouraged to treat the whole person and to address both the physical health and the mental hea lth of the person. Th is typically means coordinating care between primary car e providers and mental health professionals. State authorities should foster this coordination of care by educating both groups of health provider s on the issue of obe sity in SMI. 2.1.1: Develop standards of care for ment al health providers and work with State Medicaid agencies and other health insurers to ensure that persons with severe mental illness and obesity have access to the following interventions: -Educational/behavioral interven tions for weight management; when weight increases; -Medical treatment of obesity; and -Surgical treatment of obesity 2.2: Promote opportunities for heal th care providers, including peer Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 48 specialists, to teach heal thy lifestyles to families, individuals, and older adults. The incorporation of health lifestyle choices in any behavioral program should become a standard. Simple practice assignments in traditional psycho-social programs can increase learning and efficac y. Having participants in a program develop a plan to hold a progressive dinner 28 builds multiple psycho-social skills, increases natural support networks, provi des opportunities to learn or improve shopping and food preparation skills and creates economies of scale where healthy food choices are more available. The focus of lifestyle changes should include at least informational support for the individual's extended support network. Family and peer support groups should provide materials and information to support healthy lifestyle choices. These groups can provide training to address the stereotypical beliefs that overweight individuals are lazy. They can also provide training and support to better pr epare individuals, their families and providers in shared deci sion making approaches. Peer specialists can aid in the training process by working with recipients of programs developing goals and interven tions based on individual choice. Examples could be a recipient lead health fair, educational symposium, menu planning, or demonstration of how to m onitor one owns' weight and abdominal circumference. 2.3: Adopt American Diabetes Association (ADA) and American Psychiatric Association (APA) Second Generation Antipsychotic (SGA) monitoring as a standard of care practice for the population with serious mental illness. Monitoring should include family history, BMI, waist circumference, FBS, lipids, a nd screening for the additional cardiometabolic risk factors of sm oking and physical inactivity. Monitoring of people with SMI should include family history, BMI, waist circumference, FBS, lipids, and screeni ng for the additional car dio metabolic risk factors of smoking and physical inactivity. Patients maintained on antipsychotics should: Be weighed on every visit; Receive testing of glucose and lipids every year; Receive blood pressure checks at 12 weeks and then annually; and Have waist circumference measured at baseline and annually. 28 From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia , a progressive dinner is a dinner party in which each successive course is prepared and eaten at the residence of a different host. Altern atively, each course may be eaten at a different dining area within a single large establishment. Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 49 If weight gain, glucose abnormalities, or hyperlipidemia occur, considerations should include lifestyle modifications and changing to medication with lower risk of weight gain. Consumers should be educated about the need for routine monitoring and may be able to self-m onitor data such as weight and waist circumference. Referrals to primary ca re should also occu r for treatment of medical conditions when appropriate. 2.4: State Mental Health Authorities (SMHA) should collaborate with State Health Authorities (SHA) to address physical health assessment, health monitoring, and improvement option s for the population with serious mental illness. The issue of obesity in people with SM I provides a unique opportunity to merge physical and behavioral healthcare. Stat e Mental Health and Health Authorities can jointly support educational and policy efforts related to obesity, and should consider conjoined mental health and physic al health clinics, like the federally qualified integrated clinics, by encouragi ng mental health care provider agencies to assume greater responsibility for the overall care of the person with SMI. Linkages with public health programs and community-based programs in diabetes prevention and control, cardiovascular di sease, and healthy weight management can be established. Many community-based programs for the general population exist which can support, aid, and augment mental health services. Cooperative extension services often provide nu tritional counseling, food preparation, shopping, and other training for communities at no or minimal costs. Utilizing these natural community resources co nserves SMHA resources and advances community inclusion of persons in the public mental health system. 2.5: Bridge the collaboration gap betwee n physical and mental health care. Behavioral health care systems, incl uding State Mental Health Authorities (SMHA) should assume responsibility for assuring that individuals under their care receive the recommended routine scr eening, monitoring, and management of medical conditions including obesity. Behavioral health care systems and SMHAs have a specific responsibility since certain conditions (such as weight gain and its complications) may create an adverse effect on the prescribed pharmacological treatment regimens. A dditionally, behavioral health care professionals may come into contact with mental health consumers on a more frequent basis. Treating persons with SM I in holistic ways should allow for a free flow of information between the physi cal and mental health sides. 2.6: Monitor mental health consumers with diabetes and metabolic syndromes in mental health clinics. SMHAs should mandate and support im plementation of care management protocols directed at simultaneous ma nagement of both mental health and Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 50 diabetes designed to build on and support the individual's self -management skills. A quality improvement process can be develo ped in mental health settings that measures access, quality of care and outcomes for diabetes, and add health outcomes for physical health to ment al health treatment plans. 2.7: Establish linkages with public health programs and community-based programs in diabetes prevention and control, cardiovascular disease, and healthy weight management. Recommendations at the Community Mental Health Center and other Provider Level include: 3.1: All people with SMI should have a ccess to weight monitoring and weight management programs. Clinicians and mental health consumers ar e partners in the decision to address and treat weight problems. C linicians should emphasize that even moderate weight loss can improve a persons' health, well-being, and extend the life of that individual. Consumers and their families need to be educated on key weight management strategies: Energy expenditure must exceed energy intake to achieve weight loss (physical activity); Dietary interventions that increase knowledge about healthy eating such as reading Nutrition Facts labels, being aware of total calorie content, serving size, and nutrient values of different food products; Physical activity interventions: How to reduce sedentary behaviors (such as watching TV) and safely and slowly add more physical activ ity to ones' daily routine (such as walking); Utilize a \"small steps approach\" a combination of reduced energy intake (food) and increased physical activity that equal 100 kcal/day to prevent weight gain in most adults (for exampl e, giving up one can of regular soda per day or adding 2,000 steps to ones' day); Increase awareness to engage and motiv ate mental health consumers to adopt a healthy lifestyle and make healthier choices; Utilizing an illness management, rec overy, and wellness model, consumers should be educated on their different illn ess (i.e., schizophrenia and obesity), self regulation, and management; Inspire and encourage a healthy environment by offering healthy foods and beverages in all treatmen t settings and waiting ar eas. Provide and make available wellness fliers, posters, and othe r materials in visible areas such as waiting rooms and group room bulletin boards. Consider hosting wellness fairs; Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 51 Act as \"healthy role\" models by ea ting healthy snacks, lunches, and participating in regular physical activity; and Highlight mental health consumer's wellness achievements by sharing and recognizing successes. 3.2: Weight control programs for pe ople with SMI should incorporate nutrition, exercise, and beh avioral strategies. Consumers and their families need to be educated on key weight management strategies: Energy expenditure must exceed energy intake to achieve weight loss (physical activity); Dietary interventions that increase knowledge about healthy eating such as reading Nutrition Facts labels, being aware of total calorie content, serving size, and nutrient values of different food products; Physical activity interventions: How to reduce sedentary behaviors (such as watching TV) and safely and slowly add more physical activ ity to ones' daily routine (such as walking); Utilize a \"small steps approach\" a combination of reduced energy intake (food) and increased physical activity that equal 100 kcal/day to prevent weight gain in most adults (for exampl e, giving up one can of regular soda per day or adding 2,000 steps to ones' day); Increase awareness to engage and motiv ate mental health consumers to adopt a healthy lifestyle and make healthier choices; Utilizing an illness management, rec overy, and wellness model, consumers should be educated on their different illn ess (i.e., schizophrenia and obesity), self regulation, and management; Inspire and encourage a healthy environment by offering healthy foods and beverages in all treatmen t settings and waiting ar eas.

Consider hosting wellness fairs; Act as \"healthy role\" models by ea ting healthy snacks, lunches, and participating in regular physical activity; and Highlight mental health consumer's wellness achievements by sharing and recognizing successes. Therapies that combine modifications on diet, behavior, and physical activity have been proven to be successful at obt aining weight loss. While the Solutions for Wellness Personalized and Manualized Programs are just two examples of this type of behavioral therapy program desi gned to achieve weight management and weight loss, other similar programs exist and should be implemented with patients with serious mental illness. Interventions should not be applied without regard to individual choice. Treatment alliance should be primary consideration with interventions other than education a nd encouragement only applied when the individual identifie s weight control as their objective. Obesity Reduction & Prevention Strategies for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness 52 3.3: Prescribing clinicians should use me dications with lower risk of weight gain when possible. Clinicians should include weight gain as a major factor to consider when recommending mental health medications. In general, medications that have a lower risk of weight gain should be preferred Include the consumer when considering trade-offs between symptom control and risk of weight gain. 3.4: Utilize weight loss medication with care when appropriate. Follow the NIH recommendation for consid eration of pharmacological treatment of obesity with weight loss drugs in patients with a BMI 30 or a BMI 27 with at least two risk factors. Psychiatric side effects of these medications should be monitored more closely in this special population. 3.5: In consultation with the patient, recommend bariatric surgery when all other methods of weight loss have been tried and failed. Follow the National Institutes of Health recommendation for considering and referring for bariatric surgery in persons with a BMI of 40 or higher; or a BMI of 35 or higher in a patient with a high-risk condition such as severe sleep apnea, obesity-related cardiomyopathy, or severe diabetes mellitus; and failure of medical weight control. Use of bariatric surgery should be a treat ment of last resort and offered after consulting with the patient a ssuring ability to give informed consent and carefully weighing the risks and benefits. People with SMI may benefit from additional pre and post operative supports. Mo re research is needed. 3.6: Encourage the development of novel approaches to educate and support weight control through community programs. Programs have developed a number of nove l approaches to encourage staff and individuals with mental illness to make h ealthier lifestyle changes. These include holding \"biggest loser\" cont ests, walking clubs, and point of decision support. Simple things like reminders to consider using stairs instead of elevators can aid everyone to make healthier choices. Encour aging staff and recipi ents with mental illness to partner with an individual fo r support and motivation will also increase efficacy. Practice assignments which build on healthy decision-making, such as planning and holding a progres sive dinner, increase th e effectiveness of psycho- social interventions.
