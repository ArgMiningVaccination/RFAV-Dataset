What Is Intensive Inpatient Treatment for Addiction? An intensive inpatient treatment program is a comprehensive addiction recovery solution that combines evidence-based therapies with trauma-informed treatments to provide our clients with the skills and tools needed for successful, long-term success. The goal of an intensive inpatient treatment program is to build a personalized plan that fits each individual's specific needs and goals. Our Intensive Inpatient Treatment in Texas When clients begin at our Makana Path center in Elgin, TX, they complete an initial, comprehensive evaluation. This assessment helps the treatment team better understand what they are going through and how treatment can help. If the client could benefit from particularly involved therapy, our team will recommend the intensive inpatient treatment program. Focused Programming The intensive inpatient program is focused on building the foundation for lifelong recovery. Many of the clients we help have been resistant to treatment before or have experienced relapse at least once. We offer two primary schedules of focused programming, depending on each client's situation. - Standard - The standard program is designed to help people recover, learn the basics of sobriety, and build a support network before transitioning into sober living in a healthy environment. - Extended - Our extended program gives clients additional time to manage withdrawal symptoms and undergo therapy. Prior to moving into a transitional living program, our team ensures they have a healthy grasp on their sobriety. Clients in both our four- and six-week programs gain the skills they need to overcome their dependence on drugs and alcohol. Mindfulness and Mental Wellness We know that true healing comes when a person is engaged mentally, physically, and spiritually with their recovery plan. We utilize treatment methods in our four- and six-week programs that help clients look inward and heal. Fitness programs, nutritional wellness, and mindfulness practices are all common for our clients, but specific therapies are tailored to each individual's treatment plan. 12-Step Fundamentals Evidence-based programming that follows 12-step principles is the cornerstone of our intensive inpatient treatment programs. Our clients begin the 12-step process as soon as they are substance-free and are encouraged to continue throughout their lifelong recovery. Sober and transitional living centers at BRC Healthcare also require clients to remain in 12-step programs so they can maintain accountability. Dual Diagnosis Therapy Addiction is often the result of emotional distress and poor coping mechanisms. Many of our clients have underlying mental health and behavioral conditions that may have contributed to their addiction. We provide dual diagnosis therapy and other trauma-informed clinical mental health care services to help our clients understand the underlying cause of their addiction, process emotions, and learn how to manage symptoms in a healthy way. Our intensive inpatient treatment program at Makana Path provides people with a longstanding or significant addiction history an opportunity to start healing.
