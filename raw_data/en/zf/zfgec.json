SUMMARY OF PROPOSED ACTIONS , ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES . Paul Zweng, managing member of the hulehule Forest Conservancy, and his family \"the applicants\" seek a Conservation District Use Permit (CDUP) to build a single- family residence on their lands in the ahupuaa of Waihole, moku of Koolaupoko, on the Island of Oahu. The property consists of two parcels located in the Conservation District : Tax Map Ke y (TMK) 4 -8- 014:005 is the mauka parcel containing 1,117 acres, and TMK 4 -8-006:001 is the makai parcel containing 327 acres , totaling 1,444 acres . The proposed single -family residence project is located in Waihole Valley, along Waihole Valley North Branch Road . The proposed residence is located at the southwest corner of the makai parcel, and the only vehicular access to this area is via Waihole Valley North Branch Road. The proposed residence is within the mesic climate zone on land that is currentl y largely overgrown with non -native plant species. See Figure 1 for the approximate location of the proposed residence in relation to the property boundar ies and surrounding ahupuaa. The proposed single -family residence will be approximately 4,955 square feet in total according to the formula for measurement outlined in Hawaii Administrative Rules Chapter 13 -5, Exhibit 4. This includes all floor areas under roof including the covered lnai and carport. The home will be located roughly 200 feet from the southern property line, and about 500 feet from Waihole Figure 1 - Site Setting Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 9 Valley Road. The elevation at the site of the proposed residence is about 300 feet above sea level. See Figure 2 for a view of the overall building pad. Figure 2 - Southwest facing view of proposed overall building pad location. Land clearing and construction activities for the residence and driveway will be kept to a minimum and are anticipated to occur over an area of 1.4 acres, which would produce minor short -term impacts to noise, air and water quality and scenery. The proposed residence and driveway are sited in the general location of the former residence and driveway. The former residence included a large looping gravel driveway and formerly cleared and graded large areas for agriculture and livestock . The former residence and all other structures were removed in 2017, and these locations are currently overgrown with invasive plants and trees. The applicants will utilize the existing gravel driveway for most of the proposed new driveway access to the new dwelling in order to minimize disturbance t o the land. I mpacts from construction will be mitigated by Best Management Practices (BMPs) to control erosion and sedimentation, as described in this Draft Environmental Assessment . The applicants will ensure that their contractor performs all earthwork a nd grading in conformance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. See Figures 4 and 5 for views of the existing driveway. No threatened or endangered plant or animal species were identified in the vicinity of the proposed residence during a fauna l survey (VanderWerf, 2012) and botanical survey s (Lau, 2012 ; Ross, 2020) . One native bird, the klea (Pluvialis fulva) was observed on the makai parcel. See Appendices A, B & C for further information regarding flora and fauna on the 'hulehule Forest Conservancy. Unlike the mauka forest restoration areas with critical habitat designated for the endangered Oahu 'elepaio (Chasiempis ibidis ), no critical habitat for endangered fauna has been designated on the makai parcel of the property (TMK: [1] 4- 8-006:001) . Potential impacts to the peapea Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 10 or endangered Hawaiian hoary bat (whose range may be island -wide but is not known to occur in the area) will be avoided through careful observation and timing of vegetation removal. An archaeol ogical field survey of the mauka and makai parcels was conducted by Cultural Surveys Hawaii, Inc. in 2012 confirmed that no historic sites are present in the proposed residence area (See Appendix D ). The historic sites that are located on this parcel are outside of the project area . The location of the proposed residence, identified in the field survey letter report as \"Southern Project Area 2\", was previously disturbed by residential structures and mass grading associated with road construction, a tropical flower nursery and chicken farming. Based on these findings, it is anticipated that no cultural or historic sites will be significantly impacted by construction of the proposed residence or driveway. Residents of the Waihole- Waikne Valley area and cultural practitioners who were contacted for a cultural impact review did not feel that any of the proposed activities would have adverse impacts to cultural practices in Waihole or Waikne Valley. Figure 3 - Long -range Vision Map Figure 3 above shows the Long- range Vision for the hulehule Forest Conservancy property. A t this time, this Draft Environmental Assessment is only for the proposed single -family residence. Any other proposed plans and a ctivities articulated in the Long -range Vision Map will be submitted in future applications for a permit from the relevant agencies . Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 11 Figure 5 - View of the existing driveway loop 2.1. POTABLE WATER Water service to residential and agricultural lots in Waihole Valley is supplied mainly by the Waihole Valley Water System (WVWS) operated by the Hawaii Housing Finance & Development Corporation (HHFDC ). A future application for water service connection will be submitted to HHFDC in order to provide potable water to the property once HHFDC is accepting applications for water service connection . In correspondence with the HHFDC as a part of the early co nsultation for the Draft Environmental Assessment for this CDUA, HHFDC staff stated in a letter dated November 4, 2021 that there are currently no administrative rules and regulations for the WVWS and the HHFDC is not considering any new water applications for service connection until the administrative rules and regulations are adopted. A timeline for the adoption of administrative rules and regulations was not included in this correspondence. The proposed development of this dwelling will include a rainwa ter catchment system for potable water supply until such time as a water meter connection to the Waihole Valley Water system is possible. The source, storage, and transmission system for the WVWS was constructed in 1989 and includes a well station with t wo deep wells, a 1.0 million gallon steel reservoir, and a booster pump station. The two wells have a combined Water Use Permit of 0.075 MGD from the CWRM, although they can supply up to 1.15 MGD of good -quality water. As of 2019, the system served 159 total lots for agricultural, residential, commercial, open space, water lots, stream lots. The water line that runs along the north Figure 4 - View of existing driveway Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 12 branch of Waihole Valley Road, adjacent to the property, is an 8 -inch -diameter pipe. The HHFDC will begin critical repairs and improvements to the WVWS in the coming months. These repairs are meant to extend the lifespan of the existing system. RAINWATER CATCHMENT SYSTEM A rainwater catchment system will be constructed to supply the proposed dwelling with potable water. Agricultural water is not needed at this time as the proposed minimal landscaping will be able to sustain itself with the natural rainfall in the area. Any plans for future agricultural water supply will be included in future applications for a CDUA to support agricultural activities. The proposed rainwater catchment system will capture water from the rooftop of the proposed dwelling in the gutters of the r oof. Water will be transferred to a water holding tank, 15 foot 5 inch by 7 foot 2inch 18 gauge galvanized steel tank with 3/8 inch bolts and a food grade liner. See Figure 6 and Figure 7 for details of the proposed Water Tank Plans. The water tank will b e located approximately 25 feet from the proposed dwelling. See Appendix J: Graphics Package, drawing C100 for Site plan graphic and approximate location of the water catchment system components . The connections between the water tank and house will be via a 4\" ABS supply line from the gutters to the tank and a \u00be\" copper supply water line to the dwelling. See Figures 8 and 9 for schematics of the proposed rainwater catchment system.

WASTEWATER DISPOSAL An on -site septic system will serve the residence. It will be designed according to standards recommended by the Hawaii State Department of Health, generally as shown in Figure 10 . The wastewater management for the residence will be provided by an anaerobic septic system. The treated wastewater will leach back into the ground through a leach field system. The system will include a 1250 gallon septic tank and a 30 foot by 50 foot or 1, 500 square foot infiltrator seepage bed. Prior to construction of the septic system, an Individual Wastewater System application will be submitted to the State Department of Health for approval. Once the septic system is installed, the applicant will follow standard pumping and inspection guidelines to ensure that the system is in good working order. With a properly designed septic system, it is not anticipated that wastewater disposal will cause adverse impacts to the surrounding environment . 2.3. ROAD ACCESS Primary vehicular access to the proposed residence will be via a driveway connected to the Waihole Valley Road along the southern boundary of the makai parcel. An existing gravel driveway from Waihole Valley North Branch Road will be extended to access the proposed r esidence. The Waihole Valley Road is owned by the HHFDC, who is also the owner and operator of the valley water system as describe in section 2.1 Potable Water . The hulehule Forest Conservancy received permission from the HHFDC for vehicular access to the property from Waihole Valley Road in a letter from HHFDC dated November 4, 2021 . This letter grants permission for vehicular road access and use including for the duration of construction activities with a caution that should any damage to the road occur during construction, hulehule Fo rest Conservancy will be responsible for repairing the road to its current condition. See Figure 11 for view of the entry from Waihole Valley Road. Figure 10 - General Design of proposed septic systems Source: EPA Homeowner's Guide to Septic Systems (2005) Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 17 Site disturbance to the proposed project area and additional grading and drainage will be reduced by utilizing much of the existing driveway (See Appendix J for detailed graphics of the proposed grading and drainage plan as well as the construction erosion and sediment control plan ). 2.4. UTILITIES Electrical power to the home will be provided by rooftop solar photovoltaic panels and a connection to the electrical grid provided by the Hawaiian Electric Company via a utility pole located on Waihole Valley North Branch Road. Telecommunications will be connected from this same utility pole. These cable connections from the existing utility pole at the driveway entrance will extend into the makai parcel of the property approximately 550 feet to the site of the new dwelling. Utilities such as electrical connection to the HECO grid, phon e and cable will be connected to the dwelling via underground trench. Utilities will enter the property from a utility pole located at the main driveway access off of Waihole Valley Road. The underground trench will be 24 inches wide and 30 inches deep an d will have a 3 inch PVC conduit for the electrical and a 2 \u00bd inch low voltage conduit for phone and cable lines to reach the dwelling. See Figure 4 for approximate location of the underground utility trench and existing utility pole at the entrance to the property. SOLAR ELECTRICITY An estimate from RevoluSun for the purchase and installation of a photovoltaic system for the proposed residence stated that a suitable PV system to support the needs of the dwelling would consist of the following components : 14 kW DC 35 SunPower 400 White Watt modules 2 SE HD wave 7,600 Watt inverter 35 SE P505 Optimizer Watt inverter 3 Tesla Powerwall 2 monument HECO connect/disconnect meter The production and consumption estimate for the proposed residence and system inclu des estimated consumption of 41.3 average kWh per day or 15,070 kWh per year. The estimated solar electric system production is 44.1 average kWh per day or 16,096.23 kWh per year. See Figure 1 2 for the proposed roof Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 18 plan which features 35 photovoltaic pane ls. See Figure 4 and Figure 7 for the approximate location of the components of the proposed solar electric system. Figure 12 - Roof Plan Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 19 2.5. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT PROCESS This Environmental Assessment (EA) is being conducted in accordance with Chapter 343 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS). This law along with its implementing regulations Title 11, Chapter 200.1 of the Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR) is the basis for the environmental impact assessment process in the State of Hawaii. The preparation of this document is triggered by HRS Chapter 343 -5 which states that: (a) Except as otherwise provided, an environmental assessment shall be required for actions that: (2) Propose any use within any land classified as a conservation district by the state land use communtion under chapter 205\". Part 5 of this document states that no significant impacts are expected to occur, based on the findings for each criterion made by the agent in consultation with the Hawaii State Department of Land and Natural Resources , Office of Conservation and Coastal Lands, the determining agency. If, after considering comments to the Draft EA, OCCL concludes that as anticipated, no significant impacts would be expected to occur, then the OCCL will issue a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) and the action will be permitted to proceed with other necessary permits. If the agency concludes that significant impacts are expected to occur as a res ult of the proposed action, then and Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will be prepared. 2.6. PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT AND AGENCY COORDINATION The following agencies, organizations and individuals have been consulted during the Environmental Assessment process: Agencies and parties consulted: Federal: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Pacific Islands Fish and Wildlife Branch U.S. Army Environmental Programs Branch State: DLNR Office of Conservation and Coastal Lands DLNR Commission on Water Resources Management DLNR Division of Forestry and Wildlife DLNR State Historic Preservation Division DLNR Division of Aquatic Resources DLNR Division of Engineering Department of Agriculture Agribusi ness Development Corporation Hawai\u00b4i Housing Finance and Development Corporation Office of Hawaiian Affairs City: Department of Planning and Permitting Honolulu Fire Department Other Organizations: Waihole -Waikne Community Association Kahaluu Ne ighborhood Board #29 KEY Project Ko'olaupoko Hawaiian Civic Club Ko'olau Mountains Watershed Partnership Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 20 The Nature Conservancy Hawaii Plant Extinction Prevention Program Private Individuals: Ted Saizon Laurence Uyemura Mhoe Collins Norman Sadoyama Keoki Fukumitsu Pat Royos Copies of communications during from consultation s are found in Appendix H. 3. ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED Two alternatives to the proposed action were considered to meet the purpose of the proposed project, which is to provide a single -family residence for the Zweng family, landowners of the property. The purpose of considering project alternatives is to see i f there are other options that can meet the purpose of the project while having lesser detrimental effect on the environment. The two alternatives to the proposed action are: No Action Alternative Alternative location 3.1. NO ACTION ALTERNATIVE For the \"No Action\" alternative, there would be no change from the current situation where there is no residence available on the property for the landowners. The land cover and resources would continue to be dominated by invasive vegetation and would be visited by trespassers who illegally dump refuse and contribute to soil erosion through off -roading activities. The hulehule Forest Conservancy would be limited in its capacity to fulfill its native forest restoration activities, as well as its planned agricultural operations. Both activities require security for the necessary tools and equipment. 3.2. ALTERNATIVE LOCATION An alternative location would require the construction of a dwelling in an area that is potentially previously undisturbed. Though the entire property is over 1,400 acres, the only area previously developed as a residence is the former residence located off of Waihole Valley Road, where the proposed residence will be sited. Siting of the residence in an alternative location would potentially require more ground disturbance and land clearing of a site previously undeveloped and extensive construction of vehicular access to this alternative location , as much of the property is inaccessible via automobile. The proposed single -family residence is si ted to utilize an area that was previously developed. This will include utilizing much of the existing driveway, and will limit the need for grading Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 21 and grubbing previously undisturbed spaces. The proposed project area is the closest site to existing infrastructure (electric, and roads) and will limited the need for construction of new infrastructure to support a residence. See Figure 13 for a topographic view of the hulehule parcels and the location of the proposed residence. Figure 13 - USGS Topographic Map Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 22 4. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING , IMPACTS AND MITIGATION 4.1. NATURAL ENVIRONMENT CLIMATE Trade wind patterns have a significant effect on Windward Oahu 's climate patterns. Trade winds blow from the northeast most of the year and bring warm moist air from the ocean onto the land. As the air is forced upwards over the Ko'olau Mountains, a phenomenon known as orographic lift, the air cools, forms clouds and creates precipitati on. As a result, the mountainous regions of Windward Oahu experience frequent rainfall and are often cloudy. Fog drip at higher elevations also contributes to the overall precipitation. The highest annual average rainfall in the Ko'olaupoko district (5 ,000 millimeters, or approximately 197 inches) occurs near the summit of Pu'u ka'aumakua in the upper portions of the Waihole and Waikne ahupuaa . The average annual rainfall on the makai parcel of the property ranges from approximately 80 to 110 inches. Data from the Western Regional Climate Center (WRCC) indicate that average temperatures in the vicinity of the mauka and makai parcels (temperatures recorded in Kne'ohe mauka) vary minimally throughout the year with the warmest temperatures averaging 79.8 \u00b0 F in the summer months and the coolest temperatures averaging 68.8 \u00b0 F in the winter months. The average annual wind speed recorded at the Marine Corps Base in Kne'oh e between 1996 and 2006 was 8.4 miles per hour. Refer to Figure 1 1 above for a USGS topographic map of the hulehule property. GEOLOGY AND SOILS The Island of Oahu is formed by the eroded remnants of two elongated shield volcanoes; the older Wai'anae V olcano on the western part of the island (main shield -building stage approximately 3.8 -2.95 million years ago) and the younger Ko'olau Volcano on the eastern part (shield -building stage approximately 2.5 -1.7 million years ago). The approximate area of the Ko'olau caldera would have encompassed the areas where the towns of Kne'ohe and Kailua are now located. Two rift zones trending northwest from the caldera generated lava flows that formed the bulk of the island. The eruptive period of the volcano was f ollowed by a long period of extensive erosion, leading to the amphitheat er-shaped valleys of windward Oahu . The 'hulehule property is located in Waihole and Waikne Valley s, two of the smaller amphitheater -shaped valleys of the windward coast, just north of the town of Kne'ohe. The mauka portions of the valley have narrow ridges and very steep to precipitous slopes, which become gradually less steep in the center and makai portions of the valley. In the v ery steep mauka portions of the valley, the Ko'olau Basalt is exposed. Below the mauka cliffs, a thin layer of weathered alluvium and rock overlays the Ko'olau Basalt in the upper reaches of the valley. In the middle and lower reaches of the valley, the l ayer of weathered alluvium becomes deeper and is locally overlain with younger alluvium. The rich alluvial soils of Waikne Valley are in the Waikne silty clay series. On the lower to moderate slopes in the makai parcel, these soils are considered to be very Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 23 fertile for agriculture and are included in the Agricultural Lands of Importance to the State of Hawaii (ALISH). Lands classified as ALISH are those lands that (1) are capable of producing sustained high agricultural yields when treated and managed according to accepted farming methods, (2) contribute to the State's economic base and produce agricultural commodities, and/or (3) are needed to promote the expansion of agricultural activities and income for the future, even if not currently in agriculture. ALISH maps were drafted in 1977 by the State Department of Agriculture, with support from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the University of Hawaii College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources (CTAHR). Soils and areas of the property in cluded in the ALISH are shown in Figure 1 2 Soil Map below . Three classes of agriculturally important lands were established for the State of Hawaii : Prime Agricultural Lands : criteria for these lands include adequate moisture supply, pH between 4.5 and 8.4, deep water table, soils that are not flooded frequently during the growing season, soils that do not have serious erosion hazard, and soils that contain less than 10% of rock fragments coarser than 3 inches. Unique Agricultural Lands : those lands are used for the production of specific high -value crops (e.g., coffee, taro, rice, non -irrigated pineapple, etc.) Other Important Agricultural Lands : other agricultural lands that do not qualify as prime lands or unique lands. Generally, these lands may req uire greater application of agricultural inputs or improvements ( e.g., erosion control, drainage improvements) to produce good crop yields. Impacts and Mitigation Potential impacts on soil and water quality are primarily limited to early establishment of t he site. Potential sources of water contamination by soil deposition include erosion from construction of roads, buildings and land clearing. Best management practices will be followed to avoid soil erosion , which has the potential to contribute to impai red water quality in Waikne and Waike eke e Streams. Land clearing will be conducted outside of the wettest months from December through March, and during clement weather as much as possible. Ground cover cloths, cover crops and mulching will improve soil quality and moisture retention while landscaping is being established. Vegetated buffer areas, sediment basins and silt fences between areas of land disturbance and streams are anticipated to filter sediment and improve soil water absorption. Therefore, it is unlikely that the construction of the residence would have significant adverse impacts on the water quality of Waikne and Waikeeke e Streams. A Site- Specific Construction Best Management Practice Plan (\"SSBMPP\") will be followed during construction activities. The SSBMPP will identify appropriate BMPs for sediment control and contractor activities, and provide information on BMP installation and monitoring. BMPs related to building construction may include silt fences, compost socks, proper location of potential sediment sources, dust control, pro per stockpile management, and/or other BMPs as needed. Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 24 HYDROLOGY AND DRAINAGE Dikes in the rift zone of the Ko'olau Range consist of steeply -dipping intrusive rocks that have very low permeability and imp ound groundwater into high -altitude confined aquifers. These high -level aquifers discharge groundwater through seeps and springs into the streams of windward Oahu . The Waikne watershed is approximately 2.65 sq. miles in area and is drained by the Waikn e Stream and its tributary, the Waike'eke'e Stream, into Kne'ohe Bay. The Waikne Stream is naturally a perennial stream throughout its course. Waihole watershed is of a similar size and is drained by the Waihole Stream and its tributaries, Waianu and wao into Kneohe Bay. The USGS estimates that the average daily natural stream flow was approximately 2.3 million gallons per day (MGD) in the upper reaches of the Waikne Stream and 1.3 MGD in the Waike'eke'e Stream. However, these natural flows were significantly modified by the construction of the Waihole Ditch between 1913 and 1916 to transport water from the windward side to the sugar plantations of leeward Oahu . The ditch produced approximately 27 MGD water by collecting surface and dike- impoun ded Figure 14 - Soil Map Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 25 groundwater from the watersheds of Kahana, Waikne, Waihole, Uwao, and Waianu . Diversion of water into the ditch led to significant reductions in stream and spring flows on the windward side of the Island. Struggle over the Waihole Irrigation System began when the Oahu Sugar Company announced that it would be closing its planta tion in 1995 and thus would no longer need the ditch water. A series of water -use petitions were submitted to the Commission on Water Resources Management (CWRM) from parties with interests on the windward and leeward sides of Oahu . Leeward petitioners wanted the water that had been allocated to Oahu Sugar Company to continue to be transported to the leeward side, whereas windward petitioners wanted the water to be returned to the windward streams. The Waihole Contested Case Hearing lasted for nearly t wo years and in 1997, CWRM issued its Decision and Order, requiring that a significant amount of water from the Waihole Ditch be returned to windward streams. CWRM's Decision and Order was appealed twice to the Hawaii Supreme Court and amended twice. The most recent Decision and Order was issued in 2006, which ordered the allocation of 12 MGD of water to windward streams and 12.57 MGD of water to the Waihole Ditch. Approximately 2.1 MGD of water was returned from the Waihole Irrigation System to the south fork of the Waikne Stream. As a result, the Waikne Stream is now perennial again throughout its length, whereas the Waike'eke'e Stream is still intermittent in its upper reaches. Impacts and Mitigation Drainage around proposed structures will be designed to prevent flooding of facilities. Site grading and drainage will utilize Low Impact Development (LID) features to encourage on -site infiltration, retention and detention. These features include vegetated and rock swales, as well as natural energy dissipators and basins. Storm drain inlets and underground drain lines will be used to convey flows at walls and across roadways and to direct runoff into and from LID features. Sediment control BMPs will be implemented, including perimeter controls (fibe r rolls, silt fence, etc.), storm drain inlet protection and use of buffer zones. A Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan will be prepared and implemented throughout the duration of construction until final stabilization of all disturbed areas. Proposed impervious areas, such as roof and hardscapes, will drain to site landscaping, veget ated or rock drainage swales, and/or bioretention basins. Energy dissipators will be used at downspouts or drainage pipe outlets to disperse concentrated flows and minimize erosion. Vegetated and rock swales will be used to convey stormwater runoff from the site while also encouraging infiltration. Bioretention basins will be used to encourage infiltration, retention, detention and increase sediment capture. In larger storm events, runoff will sheet flow over existing buffer and vegetated areas. Gravel apr ons flanking the concrete driveway will reduce site imperviousness and help filter and capture roadway sediments. Routine operations and maintenance will be provided to ensure longevity and effectiveness of LID and drainage features. WATER QUALITY Under t he provisions of the Clean Water Act, the State of Hawaii Department of Health (DOH) is responsible for setting the state's Water Quality Standards (WQS). The WQS define (1) the classification Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 26 system for state surface waters, which assigns different prot ected uses to different water classes, and (2) the specific numeric and qualitative water quality criteria needed to support those protected uses. The DOH is also responsible for monitoring surface water bodies to assess whether they are meeting the crite ria of the WQS. Streams that do not meet those criteria are included on the state's Section 303(d) List of Impaired Waters. After identifying water bodies with impaired water quality, the DOH is responsible for establishing and enforcing Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs), which are the total amounts of pollutants that can flow into a water body from various pollutant sources. The establishment of TMDLs is a long and complex process, so the DOH prioritizes streams for TMDL development by severity of water quality concerns. The Waikne Stream was listed in 2006 on the State's 303(d) List of Impaired Waters with nitrate- nitrite as the pollutant of concern impacting stream water quality. However, the stream is classified as a low- priority for the developmen t of TMDLs. Nitrates are essential plant nutrients, but in excess amounts they can cause significant water -quality problems. Together with phosphorus, nitrates in excess amounts can accelerate eutrophication, causing increases in aquatic plant growth and changes in the types of plants and animals that survive in streams. Nitrates are naturally produced in the environment through the microbial decomposition of dead plant and animal matter. However, natural processes generally do not lead to excessive con centrations of nitrates in aquatic habitats. Human activities which may increase nitrate concentrations in aquatic habitats, including those of Waikne Valley, include runoff from fertilized agricultural lands and farm animal enclosures, as well as leaching from cesspools or failing septic systems. These potential sources of pollutants to Waikne Stream are primarily located in the makai portion of the valley, near the Kamehameha Highway. Impacts and Mitigation Measures to mitigate impacts to the water quality of the extended watershed will be utilized throughout construction and post -construction processes. BMPs include sediment controls such as fiber rolls, silt fence, storm drain inlet protection, as well as use of buffer zones. Special care shall be made to prevent sediment from entering swale and basin areas. Impervious surfaces will drain to vegetated or rock swales and/or bioretention basins. Bioretention basins will be used to encourage infiltration, retention, detention, and sediment c apture in order to protect the water quality and limit pollution of the watershed from runoff. Energy dissipators will be used to disperse concentrated flows at downspouts or drainage pipe outlets. Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 27 SCENIC RESOURCES The makai portions of the propert y have significant scenic resources including views towards the ocean of Kne'ohe Bay and Pu'u 'hulehule to the north. Figure 1 5 below shows the view into Waikne Valley from the makai parcel. Impacts and Mitigation The proposed residence is sited to have a minimal visual impact from Waihole Valley Road and from other parts of the valley. It is sited approximately 200+ feet further inward from the site of the former residence on the makai parcel that was removed in 2017. The former residence was a two -story structure, whereas the proposed residence will be a single- story dwelling. These design aspects will result in a less conspicuous structure with minimal visual impacts on the community view planes. BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES Habitats Major vegetation clim ate zones in Hawaii are generally classified by elevation and rainfall. The most recent vegetation classification by Gagn\u00e9 and Cuddihy (1990) identifies the following general rainfall regimes: Dry: less than 1,200 millimeters (mm) (47.2 inches) annually Mesic: between 1,200 mm (47.2 inches) to 2,500 mm (98.4 inches) annually Wet: greater than 2,500 mm (98.4 inches) Figure 15 - View of Pu'u 'hulehule from the makai property. Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 28 Additionally, vegetation zones for Oahu are also classified in three major elevation zones: lowlands located below 150 feet above mea n sea level (amsl), mid -elevation lands between 150 and 1,000 feet amsl, and mountainous lands above 1,000 feet in elevation. Mesic Forest Ecosystem The makai parcel of the property has annual rainfall ranging between 80 to 110 inches, placing it largely in the mesic climate zone, and has land elevations ranging from 120 to 500 feet. As a result of the relatively mild slopes of the makai parcel and moderate rainfall, the makai parcel was historically used for ranching, resulting in significant disturbance to the native forest vegetation. Some hala, hi'a lehua and koa trees remain on the parcel, however, the native canopy has been largely replaced by non -native invasive plants. Wet Forest Ecosystem The mauka parcel of the property is largely in the wet climate zone with land elevations ranging from about 300 to 2,600 ft amsl. The wet forest ecosystem occurs throughout much of the mauka parcel. In the minimally disturbed areas, this ecosystem is characterized by high biodiversity and a high rate of ende mism. Areas still dominated by native plant species are limited to the relatively steep mauka portions of Waikne Valley, at elevations above 1,000 feet amsl. Flora Endangered Species Records from the Hawaii Biodiversity Mapping Program (HBMP) database, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the Bishop Museum indicated that no endangered plant species have been recorded to occur within the makai parcel of the property - which is in contrast with the m auka area of the property where 24 rare plant species have been recorded historically. This is likely due in large part to the long history of land disturbances in the makai of the property, including deforestation by cattle ranching and military training . There are also no endangered plant critical habitats listed within the makai parcel. A botanical survey conducted by Mr. Joel Lau in May 2012 ( see Appendix A) confirmed that no endangered plant species were identified on the makai parcel of the property. An additional botanical survey conducted by Mr. Michael C. Ross in December 2020 (see Appendix C) further confirmed that no endangered plant species were identified in the vicinity of the proposed residence. The only native species encountered on the p roperty were the Pala indica). The fern is one of the most common indigenous ferns in the Hawaiian Islands, occurring in mesic to wet areas on all the major islands (Palmer 2003). Cyperus polystachyos , an annual sedge, and the indigenous subshrub Uhaloa, are both quite common in disturbed, grassy areas (Wagner et al. 1990). These species are restricted to the northeast portion of the mauka parcel. Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 29 Non- Native Species In the botanical survey conducted by Mr. Ross (December 2020), the upper canopy layer observed in the vicinity of the project area is dominated by a fairly young and open stand of Albizia ( Falcataria mollucana), approximately 20-30ft. in height, with -native trees, such Fiddlewood (Citharexylum Mangifera indica) occuring in smaller stands. In the understory, and especially in openings in the canopy, a thick, nearly impentrable fie ld of ) are also quite common in the understory. In shadier areas, invasive vines, such as Maile pilau ( Paederia foetida) and Ipomoea obscura, can be found climbing the taller grasses and smothering the lower branches of the trees. In the location of the former chicken farm, the space is more open and disturbed compared to other areas at the site. A diverse assemblage of non -native herbs and grasses favor this Orchids, including the Bamboo orchid ( Arundina graminifolia) and the Philippine gr ound orchid (Spathoglottis the western boundary of the makai parcel near Waihole Valley Road, there are various landscape plantings consisting of mostly ornamental species that have persisted in the area, but do not appear to be naturalizing. These include various palms, such as the Chinese Fan palm ( Roystonea regia), the latter appears to be spreading on its own. There is a non -native sword fern ( Nephrolepis brownii ) that grows as an epiphyte on many of the palm trees. There are also some bromeliads, dumb cane (Dieffenbachia sp.), and a single Cardboard palm ( Zamia furfuracea) growing in the understory of the palms. A small stand of Polynesian bamboo ( Schizostachyum glaucifolium ) and several Pua kenikeni (Fagraea berteroan) trees can be found scattered in the same area, along with a single variegated Hala (Pandanus tectorius ). In addition, some fruit trees, such as Avocado ( Persea americana), a few different species of H. caribaea, H. metallica, and H. psittacorum ), Gingers, including White ginger ( Hedychium coronarium ) introduced Shampoo ginger ( Zingiber zerumbet ), grow in this area. The single pine ( Araucaria columnaris ) found near the driveway entrance off of Waihole Valley Road appears to have been planted. See Appendix C for more details on the Ross 2020 survey of the project area. Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 30 Fauna Endangered Species According to the HBMP database and the USFWS, no endangered fauna have previously been recorded to occur within the makai parcel of the property. A survey conducted by Eric VanderWerf in April 2012 (See Appendix B) also identified no endangered species on the makai parcel. Although it is possible that the peapea or Hawaiian hoary bat ( Lasiurus cinereus semotus ) occurs in the Waikne Valley area, it was not recorded during the April 2012 survey. There is currently very little information available on the distribution, biology, and ecology of peapea on Oahu . Some research on this bat has been conducted over the past five years on the Island of Hawaii, which provides some clues as to its habitats, prey, and potential threats. Research indicates that the bat roosts in native and non-native trees with no strong preference for any particular tree species, shows seasonal patterns in movements, and establishes distinct feeding areas (Bonaccorso, 2010). Research also indicates that the bat is widespre ad at all elevations sampled, from 10 to 2,000 meters amsl, and it was observed in coastal areas, above wetlands and streams, rainforests, and dry forests. The peapea preys on Lepidoptera and Coleoptera . The decline of the peapea may be related i n large part to deforestation in the early 19 th Century. Other threats to the bats include barb -wire fences and pesticide use that may reduce or alter their prey populations. To help protect the peapea , the USFWS recommends not cutting trees greater than 15 feet in height during the bat's breeding season. Female peapea are known to leave their pups in a roost while they search for food. Pups are vulnerable during these times as they cannot fly away from the roost if threatened. Based on data, the pupping season is currently estimated to occur between June and September. Non- native Fauna There are several non -native species of concern on the property, including feral pigs and rodents. Feral pigs are of concern as they can significantly alter ecos ystems by trampling, uprooting and eating native plants, and spread the seeds of invasive species. Pigs can also contribute to soil erosion as well as negatively impact cultivated plants by foraging and rooting. Rodents can impact agricultural harvests by feeding on cultivated plants and fruits. Impacts and mitigation In the 2012 and 2020 survey s conducted on the makai parcel, including the site of the proposed project area, n o rare, threatened or endangered species were recorded (See Appendix B and C ). In order to help protect the endemic peape a, the cutting or clearing of trees that are 15 feet in height or taller will not occur during the pupping season of June to September. The 'hulehule Forest Conservancy does not anticipate any adverse impacts to these species in the proposed project area. Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 31 NATURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS Flood Hazard Risk The project area is located in Zone D, \"unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined but flooding is possible \". The proposed residence is sited near the site of the former residence at an elevation of 245 feet above sea level. The nearest streams are Waikeekee Stream to the north and Waianu Stream to the south. The project area is outsid e of any possible floodway from either of these two streams. Flooding near the proposed residence is not likely . (See Figure 1 6 below) Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 32 Figure 16 - Flood Zone Map Source: Hawai'i DLNR: http://gis.hawaiinfip.org/fhat/ Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 33 Military -related Environmental Contaminants The property was used by the U.S. military as a training ground from 1942 to 1976. The U .S. Military designated the area as the Waikne Training Area (WTA). A series of Unexploded Ordnance ( UXO ) investigations and removal efforts have been conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) on the property since the 2000's and are summarized below. An Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analy sis (EE/CA) to evaluate munitions and explosives of concern (MEC) within the WTA was conducted in 2006. During the EE/CA, seven MEC items were recovered in the southeastern portion of the WTA and removed. One hundred and seventy -two munitions debris item s were also found. An abbreviated Site Investigation (SI) focusing on the WTA was conducted in 2008. A team of samplers collected two multi -incremental soil samples in areas where MEC were found during the EE/CA and collected two co -located surface water and sediment samples from the Waikne Stream, downstream of locations where MEC were found. The samples were analyzed for Target Analyte List metals and explosives. Contaminants of potential concern identified in the SI were chromium, iron, vanadium, cobalt, mercury, and Research Department Explosive or \"RDX\", an explosive nitroamine widely used in military applications during World War II. Chromium, iron, and vanadium exceeded action levels, and additional analysis will be required to clarify whether t hose concentrations are background levels or related to military activities. Elevated concentrations of hexavalent chromium and mercury would be of particular concern for human and environmental health. A Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) and removal of MECs was conducted in 2011. The purpose of the RI/FS was to determine further actions to reduce the risk of remaining UXO, discarded munitions, and constituents of concern. The study included three general investigation areas: the \"Western /Mountainous Region\" in the mauka Valley, \"Southern Impact Region\" just mauka of the northern cacao area, and the \"Southeastern Region\" in the general vicinity of the northern cacao area. The investigation indicated that only minim al amounts of munitions debris were found in the Western/Mountainous Region. In the Southern Impact Region and Southeastern Region, munitions debris were found but no MECs were recovered outside of the removal areas. The highest munitions debris concentra tions were found in the Southeastern Region. A qualitative MEC hazard assessment was conducted for the Southern and Southeastern Regions, which assigned a Hazard Level of 4 indicating \"low potential explosive hazard conditions.\" Removal of MECs was conduc ted in a large portion of the northern cacao farm area. The removal effort included a 100% sweep of the removal areas and recovered 50 MEC items from the Southeastern Region. Although no MECs were identified outside of the removal areas, the USACE cannot guarantee that all MECs have been removed from the property. Based on the work conducted by the USACE, areas where the MEC removal effort was conducted are considered clear. Steep Terrain and Erosion The morphology of the terrain on the makai parcel is highly variable, ranging from nearly level on ridge tops and in gulch bottoms to slopes in excess of 35% along gulch walls. Slopes in excess of 35% are Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 34 generally considered unsuitable for agricultural a ctivities. Gully erosion is visible in disturbed sloping areas and on steep jeep trails where the vegetation has been removed. There is a significant amount of erosion on -or-about the Waikne Valley Road and the tops of ridges in the northern part of the makai parcel. The erosion is related to illegal recreational off- road vehicle motoring gained by trespass. Illegal Property Access The mauka and makai parcels are illegally accessed on a regular basis for hunting, dumping, and recreational off- road ve hicle use. Off -road vehicle use has developed significant erosion in the northern part of the parcel. Additionally, illegal dumping of refuse also occurs in parts of the property . Impacts and Mitigation Siting of the proposed residence in a flat open ar ea will help minimize soil erosion. An Erosion and Sediment Control plan will be prepared and implemented throughout the duration of construction until final stabilization of all disturbed areas is complete. Erosion control best management practices includ e providing temporary or permanent stabilization of exposed areas, preserving existing vegetation as long as possible, and minimizing soil compaction. Wind erosion controls and dust management will be implemented to minimize impacts. Protection of post -construction LID improvements will be required until all phases of construction are complete. Construction equipment and heavy truck traffic will be minimized to reduce compaction and infiltration capability at the basin areas. Special care will be made to pr event sediment from entering and clogging swale and basin areas. All exposed areas will be stabilized using either vegetative or non -vegetative means. The 'hulehule Forest Conservancy will help to mitigate the impacts of illegal off -roading and refuse du mping on the property by maintaining a presence . The potential existence of MECs on the property may pose \"low potential explosive hazard conditions\" to people and animals that enter the residence area. Signage will inform people of this potential risk an d the 'hulehule Forest Conservancy will maintain contact with the USACE for updates on the status of military -related hazards. 4.2. SOCIO-ECONOMIC , CULTURAL AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCES WAIHOLE -WAIKNE VALLEY AREA HISTORY Pre-Contact It is estimated that H awaiians first settled the windward coast of Oahu as early as 1,500 years ago. The abundance of fresh water in streams and springs along the coast allowed the development of extensive loi kalo (taro terraces) and loko i'a (fishponds) in the watersheds o f Kne'ohe Bay. The fertile soils and extensive agricultural lands allowed the growth of a large Hawaiian population on the windward coast, which was estimated at 20,000 -25,000 inhabitants at the time of initial Western contact. Before Western contact, H awaiians had established an intricate land tenure system and hierarchical structure, whereby the land could not be owned or traded, but instead was carefully managed to sustain Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 35 its resources for the people of Hawaii. In this land tenure system, ahupuaa were land divisions that generally extended from the mountain tops out into the sea to allow their inhabitants access to a full range of resources. Exchange between mauka and makai resources allowed most ahupuaa to be fairly self- sufficient. Groups of ahupuaa formed large moku or districts. The mauka and makai parcels of the property are located within the Waihole and Waikne ahupuaa in the moku of Ko'olaupoko. The name Waikne is an abbreviation of the word Wai -a-Kne, which means \"Water o f Kne\" (Pukui et al., 1974:223). Kne was one of the four principal Hawaiian gods representing the source of life. Handy and Handy (1972, p.446) describe the following story about the naming of Waikne: \"As Hi'iaka's canoe skirted the windward coast of Oahu , she greeted many a site made famous or hallowed by the exploits of her ancestors in the area before the Pele clan moved onward to the younger island, Hawaii. Passing the shores of Waikne (the original name was Wai- a-Kne, Water -of-Kne), she ained to her companion, Wahine -oma'o, that here Kne first dug for water at a place called Poliuli, creating the Wai'ola- li, which was male, and the Wai'ola- la, which was female.\" Handy and Handy (1972, p.442) also describe the traditional Hawaiian taro agriculture in the ahupuaa of Waikne: \"Waikne was a major source of Ko'olau taro, especially in the broad area between the highway and the sea, and as much as half a mile inland there was extensive loi cultivation. The northern (and larger) section, extending mauka for two or more miles, used to have cultivated loi and home sites all along Waikne Stream. The southern section of the valley, divided off by a low ridge, comprises a gulch where there were old terraces watered by Waike'eke'e Stream, no longer cultivated in taro.\" Post -Contact Many changes occurred with Western contact in Hawaii, including catastrophic Hawaiian population declines from disease epidemics, changes in land tenure from the traditional ahupuaa model to the Western private property model, the start of new agricultural endeavors for profit rather than subsistence, and the importation of many immigrant workers from Asia and the Pacific Islands to work on large plantations. By the 1880s, taro production on the windward side was largely replaced by sugar and rice plantations. In Waikne Valley three rice plantations were in operation in 1880 in the makai part of the valley. The rice industry declined in th e early part of the 20 th Century, partly because of demographic and economic changes, and also because of the introduction of pests including rice birds and the rice borer insect. Between February 1913 and December 1916, the Waihole Irrigation Company, a subsidiary of Oahu Sugar company, built the Waihole irrigation system. The system was designed to bring water from the wet valleys of windward Oahu to Oahu Sugar's plantation in leeward Oahu . Additions to the system were made from 1925 to 1933 and in 1964. The whole system is approximately 25 miles long and Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 36 stretches from Kahana Valley to Kunia in the Ewa District of Oahu . The system collects primarily dike - impounded groundwater and historically produced 27 million gallons of water per day for t he plantation. Flows in Kahana, Waikne, and Waihole Streams were significantly reduced as a result of the Waihole irrigation system. Despite the agricultural changes throughout the windward and leeward Oahu , Handy reported that in 1935, there was sti ll a broad area of terraces at Waikne, where large crops of taro were being raised to sell to poi factories (Handy 1940, p.97). There were also inland terraces with taro for milling situated between the Waikne and Waike'eke'e Streams. These inland terra ces are still present on the property, although they are not cultivated and are now overgrown by invasive plants. Starting in 1942, the U.S. Army leased 1,061 acres of land in Waikne Valley from the McCandless heirs and Waihole Water Company to conduct a dvanced offensive warfare training and air- to-ground practice bombing. In 1953, the lease was transferred to the U.S. Marine Corps, which continued training in the valley until 1976 when the lease was terminated. The Marine Corps conducted ordnance clearance sweeps in 1976 and 1984. The 1976 clearance effort resulted in the removal of over 24,000 pounds of practice ordnance and fragments, including 42 unexploded ordnances (UXOs). The 1984 effort resulted in the removal of 16,000 pounds of demilitarized p ractice ordnance and 190 UXOs. In 1989, the U.S. Marine Corps acquired title to the 187 -acre ordnance impact area located immediately to the northeast of the mauka parcel. In 2003, a proposal to use the parcel for blank -fire training was abandoned as a r esult of safety concerns from UXOs. Meanwhile, the Ko'olaupoko District experienced a population boom starting in the 1940s. Several factors contributed to the district's rapid rate of population growth and development, including the decline of the ag riculture industry and subdivision of land by large landowners to lease or sell parcels for residential or commercial use. Additionally, the completion of the Pali Tunnels in 1957 and the Wilson Tunnels in 1960 improved access to the windward side from Ho nolulu and further spurred the transformation of Kne'ohe and Kailua from small rural communities into suburban population centers. Land subdivision and development also was proposed for the Waihole and Waikne Valleys in the 1970s. However, the small c ommunity of residents and farmers of Waihole -Waikne organized to oppose these proposed commercial developments. When threatened with eviction by the Waihole Valley landowner, Mrs. Elizabeth Lloyd Marks, the Waihole residents organized protests, includ ing a civil disobedience demonstration that temporarily blocked the Kamehameha Highway. In order to resolve the issue, the State acquired the Waihole Valley lands in 1977 and organized the grounds as an agricultural state park and rural community subdivision in 1986. These lands cover approximately 600 - acres in Waihole and Waikne valleys. The majority of these lands are currently under the management of the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC) , an agency under the Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism . The Waihole -Waikne community has continued to fight against development threats to land and water in the valleys. In one of the most significant water struggles in the State, the Waihole- Waikne community fo ught throughout the 1990s and 2000s for the return of water from the Waihole Irrigation Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 37 System (which transports water to leeward agricultural producers) to windward streams. In 2006, CWRM issued its Decision and Order on this case, which resulted in the restoring of 12 MGD to windward streams and allocated 12.57 MGD to leeward users. The case is further discussed in Section 2.3 above. ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE VICINITY OF THE PROPOSED RESIDENCE The most recent archaeological inventory survey conducted in the p roject area was completed by Ms. Coral Rasmussen in 2008 in support of the UXO assessment and removal operations conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 2008 through 2010. The archaeological inventory survey recorded the following sites on the makai parcel: Site 50 -80-06-1078: a loi complex nominated to the National Register in 1973 (\"Waikne Taro Flats\"). The site is at the confluence of the north fork and south fork of Waikne Stream and extends across the northwest corner of the makai parcel, the mauka parcel, and the neighboring U.S. Marines parcel. The site is composed of eight traditio nal Hawaiian terrace sets that include stone -built terrace walls enclosing loi, 'auwai, and probable habitation sites on raised ground near the loi . Site 50 -80-06-4356: a loi complex that was originally recorded by Dunn et al . 1992. The site is located along the Waike'eke'e Stream, approximately 250 meters upstream of the junction with Waikne Stream. Five terrace sets were identified along the alluvial stream deposits on the bends in the stream. The complex includes traditional Hawaiian features such as terrace walls enclosing loi, 'auwai, a trail, and probable habitation areas near the loi. Site 50 -80-06-4361: a post -contact site near the Waike'eke'e Stream with nine charcoal kilns, a rock alignment, and remnants of a historic trail or road. Remn ants of two types of kiln are present at this site, including earth covered mound kilns and excavated kilns. Site 50 -80-06-4352: a small loi complex located on a small meander loop of a tributary to an unnamed intermittent stream that crosses the makai parcel. Traditional Hawaiian loi features, including terraces, embankments, and a possible habitation were identified, as well as 'ulu and noni trees on the opposite side of the stream from the habitation site. Site 50 -80-06-4359: two excavated charcoal kilns (first recorded by Dunn et al. 1992) on the south side of a gulch with flowing water. Site 50 -80-06-4362: a charcoal kiln first recorded by Dunn et al. (1992). Site 50 -80-06-6862: a set of six fighting positions or foxholes excavated into the hills ide and top of a small knoll. M -60 machine gun bullets, other ammunitions, and miscellaneous fragments were present on the ground surface around the foxholes. Prior to that survey, Dunn et al. (1992) conducted a survey of the entire makai parcel in 1972 and recorded a few additional sites outside of the 2008 survey area: Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 38 Site 50 -80-06-4360: a small loi in a gulch near the border between the makai parcel and the City and County of Honolulu pro perty. Sites 50 -80-06-4354 and 50 -80-06-4355: Excavated charcoal kilns. Sites 50 -80-06-4351, 50 -80-06-4353, and 50 -80-06-4358: small loi sets near an unnamed intermittent stream that crosses the makai parcel, near the eastern boundary of the parcel. Figure 17 - Archaeological Site Map A field survey was conducted by Cultural Surveys Hawaii in 2012 that confirmed the findings of the previous archaeological surveys and did not identify any historic sites within the vicinity of the proposed residence . The letter report from that field survey is included as Appendix D. The survey areas and locations of historic sites on the makai parcel are shown i n Figure 15 above . Impacts and Mitigation No historic sites were identified in the area of the proposed residence, surrounding landscap ed areas and the driveway access road during pr evious archaeolog ical surveys. The identified historic loi sites, \"Waikne Taro Flats ,\" are approximately one-half mile from the site of the proposed residence. Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 39 Therefore, the proposed project is not expected to cause any adverse impacts to historic archaeological sites w ithin the makai parcel. A restoration plan prepared by Cultural Surveys Hawaii, in consultation with SHPD/DLNR, describes the methods and procedures that will be used to restore and reuse historic taro loi and also protect certain features of those sites which have been identified as having traditional cultural significance. CULTURAL PRACTICES Cultural practices in Waihole and Waik ne Valley s and the surrounding area of windward O ahu go back many centuries through oral tradition and storied landscapes. Many of the current residents can trace familial descent for generations, and they carry with them stories of the land, resources, and people of this area. To assess the potential impact of the proposed uses by the hulehule Forest Conservancy (native forest restoration, farming, and a single -family residence) on cultural practices in Waihole -Waikne Valley s, historical and cultural source materials were consulted, along with interviews with knowledgeable community members. Permission to include information gathered during interviews was granted by all interviewees. A number of historic sources were reviewed and summarized by Cultural Surveys Hawaii during their preparation of the loi restoration plan (See Appendix E). Source materials include The Kumulipo, translated by Beckwith in 1951; Native Planters in Old Hawaii by Handy and Handy (1972); and N Wahi Pana 'o Ko olaupoko , compiled by Landgraf (1994), among others. These sources document many stories, significant places and traditions connected to the ahupuaa of Waikne , including references to the Hawaiian akua (gods) Kne and Hi'iaka, the Hawaiian demi- god Kamapua'a as well as the Kumulipo (Hawaiian origins chant). In historic times, Waikne Valley was famed for its abundance of water and other resources utilized by traditional Hawaiians. Kalo and other crops provided food for a large population. Sites of religious and/or political significance include Kukuianiani Heiau, located near the coast of Waikne, and Ka'awakoa Heiau, which at one time stood in close proximity. Additionally, several upl and sites have been interpreted as agricultural shrines. Waikne is one of three puuhonua (place of refuge) lands of Koolaupoko. The sport of hlua sledding was practiced by the chiefs and ordinary people on a steep incline behind the present -day Catho lic Church, ending on a lower plain area. Ala hele (trails) constructed by ancient chiefs are described in mythology of the area. Three kuleana parcels or Land Commission Awards (LCA) are located on the mauka and makai parcels of the property in the vici nity of proposed residence. Ku #5716:4 Wahahee #10973:2 The LCA to Ku #5716:4 is located i n Waikne Valley and is identified as a banana patch and is located approximately 3,500+ feet from the proposed project area ( See Figure 18). The LCA to Puaa #10880 B:4 Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 40 is located in Waikne and was approximately \u00bc of an acre and was used as gardens. This parcel w as documented as having two hala trees, two ulu trees and 3 orange trees. There was no house lot, loi or other structures documented on this site. It is approximately 375 feet from the project area. The LCA to Wahahee #10973:2 is identified as a having one kalo patch. This parcel does not have a house site or structure identified on it. It is located over 1,300 feet from the proposed project area. Figure 18 - Property Map with Kuleana parcels A number of community members were contacted and interviewed to assess the potential impacts of the proposed residence on cultural resources in the area . A list of prospective interviewees was assembled by consulting with Cultural Surveys Hawaii, who had conducted some interviews for the historic taro loi preservation plan. Members of the Wai hole -Waik ne Community Association also provided contact information for knowledgeable interviewees. Phone interviews were conducted with community leaders, cultural practit ioners and long- time residents. A total of sixteen people were contacted, and five were willing and able to discuss cultural practices in the Waikne Valley area. Interviews were conducted in 2012, and December 2020/ January 2021 with long- time residents a nd cultural practitioners who are familiar with the site. A public notice was published in the Office of Hawaiian Affair's April Issue of Ka Wai Ola soliciting community input on the proposed residence. Two individuals responded to this public notice via telephone and left voicemail messages requesting the opportunity to comment. These individuals were contacted via telephone on multiple occasions for a follow -up interview but did not respond to these inquiries. Details of community outreach can be found in Appendix F & G. Mr. Ted Saizon has lived on Waihole Valley R oad. for twenty years. Before Waikne Valley, his family lived in nearby Kahalu u. His family traces its origins in Kahalu u to the 1800's, and many of Mr. Saizon's Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 41 relatives still live on the peninsula behind the fishpond. As a child he attended school in Wai hole Valley, and remembers the valley was mostly in farming then as it is now. Now, more people live in the valley. Way back, there used to be cattle in the valley. Mr. Saizon thought that a farm would be good because it's all farming in the area. Some people go pig hunting, hiking and bike riding in the valley. Old families sometimes go into the forest to get bamboo for decoration and garden trellises. So me people also gather edible fern shoots from the forest. The government closed off the back side of the valley where the Kamaka 's used to be because it was a former military training area. Before that, the Kamaka 's used that land for a long time. They used to have loi way up in the valley. Mr. Saizon takes care of his five grandchildren who live with him. He is thankful that they have a place to stay for a while, but is unsure what will happen in the future (Saizon interview, 2012). [Note: the Saizo n family has since moved away and their house and related structures have been taken down and removed from the area.] Mr. Saizon mentioned that in his time as a tenant on the property, no cultural or lineal descendants ever requested access to the property for traditional or customary practices. The only persons who requested access to the property were friends who accessed the property for pig hunting. These persons were identified as friend s of the Saizon's and not as long- time residents of the area. Mr. Keoki Fukumitsu is a resident of Hakipuu , an ahupuaa next to Waikne. His family is a kuleana landowner, receiving title to the land during the Great Mhele. The family migrated from Waikne to Hakipuu in the time of Kamehameha I. Mr. Fukumitsu has been active in the community with a focus on agriculture and Native Hawaiian subjects for many years. He was a founder of the Native Hawaiian legal corporation, and used to be very active in the area's Neighborhood Boards. He served on the Governor's \"Ta ro Purity and Security Task Force\" that had been monitoring and advocating for expanded taro production. Mr. Fukumitsu shared his knowledge of the area's history and its cultural significance. Hakipuu and Waikne valley were very sacred places that the king gave to the kahuna. This area is where the first voyagers from the Pacific landed, so it holds the significance of what they brought on the voyage in their canoes. L au lapaau (medicinal plants) and trees were some of the plants they brought from across the Pacific. Each site signified an individual and his trade, with trades going from mountain to ocean. For example, Ka hai brought ulu to Hakipuu . Mauiloa is buried between Waikne and Hakipuu . The history here goes back 25,000 years. In the modern day, as we put these pieces together, it becomes a more significant reality, a real history. This history represents a way of life that is being modernized and Westernized. P eople started using animals like buffalo and oxen to pull carts. It was sophisticated living, even in grass shacks, pounding poi. Then cars arrived. Now we're trying to integrate tradition with modern life (Fukumitsu interview, 2012). Mr. Fukumitsu has done extensive research on the history of the area, and has documents from the Great Mhele, population counts, Land Commission awards and court awards from the approximate time period of 1850 -1920. He is interested in preserving the ahupua a, with parti cular emphasis on native crops. Cacao is believed to be compatible with native crops, and is environmentally sound and has good economic potential. Taro is culturally and educationally important, but labor- intensive. There is economic possibility there, but it needs to be an agricultural operation, a business. In the olden days Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 42 taro was a dietary staple and an industrial crop with significance throughout Hawaii and the Pacific. We need to prove to future generations that taro can be grown again (Fukum itsu interview, 2012). Based on her arch aeological investigation, Ms. Coral Rasmussen concluded the documented cultural resources in the valley represent \". . . part of a landscape of traditional Hawaiian taro production and later historic period charcoal manufacturing that likely occurred alongside the taro production .\" These planting sites were located along the alluvial flats near streams, and probable habitation sites were present on higher ground near these fields. Rasmussen also noted that metal tools found in association with some cultivated fields indicate these were being farmed into the early 20th century, an observation that is consistent with oral - historical information from local families who report such activities into the 1920s (Cultural Surveys Hawaii, 2012). Many people are interested in perpetuating the cultural and agricultural traditions of the Waikne and Waihole area in the modern context. Mrs. Pat Royos was born in Waihole Valley in 1945, was raised there and continues to live in the valley today. She has served as president of the Waihole- Waikne Community Association (WWCA) and is currently an active member. Her parents came to Waihole Valley in 1932, after her father lost his leg while working at the quarry in Waimnalo. Their family farmed banana and papaya on a seven -acre lot. There were many taro loi in those days. Mrs. Royos shared her perspective on the area's history, and the importance of activities like farming, canoe building and preservation of important natural and cultural sites. One significant historic site is the Waikne pier, which has a legacy of more than 100 years. Ships used to pick up crops grown in Waihole and Waikne valleys, such as coffee, sugarcane, rice, and pineapple. There was a train track that carried food from up in the valley down to the pier. Mrs. Ro yos believes that restoration of the collapsing pier could foster mauka- makai connections within the ahupuaa . Canoes carved out of albizia trees from the valley could serve as an educational tool for children and could be launched from the pier. Agricult ure plays a prominent role in Waikne's history, and Mrs. Royos felt it important to maintain a residential and agricultural community that is different from \"outside\" (Royos interview, 2012). The number of cultivated taro patches in the valley declined s ignificantly in the 1960's. Now very few farmers in the valley still grow taro, although many people are interested. If more taro and other crops are grown, that may help the community get back more of the water that is currently being diverted to Leewar d Oahu . Another challenge is that all the old -timers who knew how to farm are fading away, and the next generation is more interested in office jobs. There is a need for \"serious farming\" in Waihole and Waikne (Royos interview 2012). Mrs. Royos and the WWCA support plans for a proposed farm, because they would rather see farming than development. They believe Mr. Zweng is different from the previous landowner. He is involved in the community, and they see him every weekend. He is going through the correct process, showing the community his proposal, and they trust him. Seeing what he's doing so far, they support the project. Mr. Fukumitsu agreed that the ' hulehule Forest Conservancy's plans to plant cover crops, use mulch Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 43 and avoid land clearing during the rainy season would help to mitigate the potential impacts of soil runoff on the aquatic environment. The interviewees agreed that it would be reasonable for Mr. Zweng and his family to live on the same property as a farm. Access to land, loans a nd markets will also be critical to developing viable agricultural operations in the Waikne area. An open market has been proposed for Waihole- Waikne Park, to encourage more farming since farmers would have a place to sell their products. Mrs. Royos feels that people living in the area would care for the park and that it would be a beautiful place for the community. The cleaning of public spaces and restoration of the natural environment is seen as a means of bringing members of the community together and teaching young people. People want to clean the area near the poi factory, and to see beautiful scenery with plenty of loi. \"Anything can happen with willpower, then people want to get involved\" (Royos interview, 2012). Mr. Fukumitsu used to volun teer cultivating taro 30 years ago on the Kamaka family kuleana parcel up in Waikne valley. They also used to clean the land, propagate native species, and also hike on trails to hunt and gather mountain apples. Those lands were condemned by the Federal government to serve as military training grounds until 9/11. The government hasn't made an attempt to clean up that part of the valley, only the lower areas (Fukumitsu interview, 2012). Regarding the proposed development of the residence and farm, Mr. F ukumitsu commented that removal of vegetation may cause runoff that would impact water quality in the streams, shore areas and ocean. Sediment running off the land can smother limu, oo pu, and other native aquatic species as well as coral reefs. There n eeds to be a good vegetated buffer zone between the cleared land and the stream, which can be accomplished by planting from the bottom up. This practice was followed in traditional taro planting. Mr. Fukumitsu did not think that the proposed farm would im pact any cultural practices in Waikne Valley (Fukumitsu interview, 2012). An interview was conducted with Laurence Uyemura, a long -time resident of Waihole Valley North Branch road , current President of the WWCA and lineal descendant of Inoino, a land commission awardee in Hakipuu ahupuaa. Mr. Uyemura stated that he has lived in Waihole since his childhood, and he has explored the property now owned by the hulehule Forest Conservancy. He mentioned that he does not recall any loi or other ancient structures or sites in the vicinity of the proposed residence. He mentioned that most of the loi were closer to the Waikeekee Stream and Waianu Stream in the valley. Mr. Uyemura reme mbers walking through the property when portions of it were used by the military after the attack on Pearl Harbor. He recalls that that area was further north closer to the Waikne Valley area. When asked if he is aware of any kuleana landowners or lineal or cultural descendants connected to the property, he shared that he does not know of any lineal or cultural descendants who access the property for cultural purposes. Mr. Uyemura does remember the Saizon family living on the property for many years. He re members that there was a horse stable, a residence, a chicken farm, nursery, and some other agricultural areas. Mr. Uyemura does not feel that the construction of the proposed residence would impact traditional or customary practices in the valley. Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 44 An inte rview was conducted with Mhoe Collins, a lifelong resident of Waihole Valley, cultural practitioner, member of the WWCA steering committee, and landowner of a kuleana land parcel located on Waihole Valley North Branch Road. Mr. Collins was raised in Waihole Valley, and he attended Waihole Elementary School as a child. He explored the property that is now owned by the hulehule Forest Conservancy as a child, and remembers playing on the property with his childhood friends. Mhoe is a cultural practitio ner and speaker of lelo Hawaii, the native language. When asked if he knew of any cultural or lineal descendants to the property, Mr. Collins stated that he does not know of any ohana or persons who claim lineal or cultural descendancy to that property . He also mentioned that he is not aware of any kalo farming that took place in the vicinity of the proposed residence. He mentioned that the kalo farming that he is aware of was located along Waianu Stream in the south side of Waihole Valley, and nearer to Waikeekee Stream in Waikne. He also mentioned that there was extensive kalo farming makai of the Kamehameha Highway, in what is now City and County owned lands. Mr. Collins was not familiar with the location of the three kuleana land parcels located within the property. He asked that appropriate research be conducted to see if the Land Commission Award documents show any official trails or auwai. He mentioned that access rights to those trails and auwai will need to be protected into the future and asked that should these exist on the land documents that appropriate protection measures be implemented to preserve those important uses and rights. The coastal ecosystem has a great deal of cultural and environmental significance. The muliwai (river mout h area) is important because many fish and crustaceans conceive there. Species like hhwai and pae l ay eggs in the sand. Ocean species like mullet, moi and awa come to the muliwai, where their hormones are activated by sweet (brackish) water and they reproduce (Fukumitsu interview, 2012). Community members are interested in protecting and restoring the aquatic environment by making an area for fish to lay eggs. They would need netting and more fresh water from the streams to create the right habitat for holehole (mullet), crabs and limu (seaweed, algae). The 'hulehule Forest Conservancy is planning to restore two areas where taro was historically grown on the property. The Waikne Taro Flats, located primarily in the mauka parcel, with some terraces in the northwestern corner of the makai parcel, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The site consists of seven terrace sets; associated agricultural features such as 'auwai; possible habitation features; and religious features including an agricultural shrine and a birthing stone. The Waikeekee Loi is located in the northern portion of the makai parcel, and consists of five terrace sets and other agricultural features; a number of charcoal kilns and a boulder with historic p etroglyphs. A restoration plan prepared by Cultural Surveys Hawaii, in consultation with SHPD/DLNR, describes the methods and procedures that will be used to restore and reuse the loi and also protect certain features of those sites which have been identified as having traditional cultural significance (See Appendix E ). Although neither of the areas lie within the boundaries of the proposed residence , the restoration of historic loi so that traditional agriculture may be practiced is a positive impact of the activities proposed by the 'hulehule Forest Conservancy. Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 45 Impacts and Mitigation The proposed residence is not anticipated to impact traditional and customary practices in the vicinity of the proposed project area . Community members interviewed for the cultural impacts of the proposed action supported the 'hulehu le Forest Conservancy's overall vision for the property. Mr. Fukumitsu expressed some concern that the ground -disturbing activities proposed for the early stages of site preparation and construction could cause runoff into the stream. Best Management Pra ctices will be used during land clearing, road repairs and facilities construction to control runoff. Community members interviewed regarding access rights to the property for traditional and customary practices on the property stated that they are not a ware of any families or persons who are identified as cultural or lineal descendants to kuleana parcels on the property. The hulehule Forest Conservancy is committed to allowing access for traditional and customary practices to cultural or lineal descend ants of Waihole and Waikne in the future. The proposed residence will not impede upon the protected access rights of native persons to the property. In the land documents for the kuleana land commission awards identified on the property, there were no references to walking trails. SOCIO -ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT Most of Waihole -Waikne Valley s remain relatively undeveloped, with a number of tenants leasing both residential and agricultural lots from the HHF DC. The agricultural park neighboring the 'hulehule Forest Conservancy parcels are intended to provide long- term affordable rental housing for tenants in Waihole and Waikne Valleys who were threatened with eviction during the 1970s, to promote diversified agriculture, and to preserve the rural lifestyle of the valleys. Construction and development activities have been concentrated in the southwestern portions of the ahupuaa, near Kamehameha Highway. The hulehule Forest Conservancy will continue to host volunteer workdays for their native forest restoration activities. The average size of volunteer groups has been around 2 -5 individuals per group. Volunteer workdays have taken place on the property for several years, with volunteers using Waihole Valley Road for access to the site. The proposed residence will provide safe and secure parking for volunteers. The proposed single -family residence will not be used for any commercial tourism or visitor industry activities , which was a concern expressed by some members of the community . This site will be used as a residence for the Zweng family and future planning includes the construction of additional facilities to support the forest restoration activities of the hulehule Forest Conservancy and the planned agricultural operation for which a CDUA was submitted and approved in 2013. [note: the permits submitted and approved for native forest restoration and a cacao farm are currently expired. A new application for a permit will be submitted for any future facilities or activities that require a conservation district permit.] As is stated in HAR \u00a713 -5-41 (b) \"not more than one single family residence shall be authorized within the conservation district on a legal lot of record\", the proposed residence will be the Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 46 only dwelling for the entire 1,400+ acre property. It is understood that though the parcels have two independent TMK's, the OCCL will treat the property as one legal lot of record and will only allow one single -family residence to be constructed. Impacts and Mitigation Construction of the proposed residence will provide temporary local jobs in Wai hole Valley . Due to the small size of the volunteer groups and a history of use for one residence with no disturbance to the local community , there are no antic ipated significant impacts on traffic to the two -lane residential Waihole Valley Road. The proposed single -family residence will have no anticipated impact on the rural, agricultural character of the community. 4.3. EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE POTABLE WATER The nearest Board of Water Supply water main in the Waihole -Waikne area is located along Kamehameha Highway. This water main services lots located in the vicinity of the highway. Water service to residential and agricultural lots in Waihole Valley is supplied mainly by the Waihole Valley Water System (WVWS) operated by Doonwood Engineering on behalf of the Hawaii Housing Finance & Development Corporation (HHFDC). The source, storage, and transmission system for the WVWS was constructed in 1989 and in cludes a well station with two deep wells, a 1.0 million gallon steel reservoir, and a booster pump station. The two wells have a combined Water Use Permit of 0.075 MGD from the CWRM, although they can supply up to 1.15 MGD of good -quality water. As of 2019, the system serve d 159 total lots for agricultural, residential, commercial, open space, water lots, stream lots and roadways including the Waihole Elementary School. The line located along the north branch of Waihole Valley Road, adjacent to the makai parcel, is an 8 -inch -diameter PVC pipe. The basic charge for water use from the WVWS as of 2016 was $3.00 monthly per meter in addition to a domestic rate of $0.90 per thousand gallons, and/or an agricultural rate equal to the domestic rate for the first 15,000 gallons and $0.22 for each additional thousand gallons. In a letter received in April 2021, HHFDC stated that administrative rules and regulations need to be adopted for the Waihole Valley Water System, and new connections to the water system will need to be held until that time. An additional letter dated November 4, 2021 from HHFDC states that no applications for water connections to the Waihole Valley Water System will be accepted at this time. Given this info rmation from HHFDC, the hulehule Forest Conservancy is proposing a rainwater catchment system to provide a domestic water source for the proposed residence. Details of this rainwater catchment system can be found in Section 2. 1 Potable water. Copies of these letters can be found in Appendix H. If a water meter connection to the Waihole Valley Water system as a source of potable water for the hulehule parcels is possible, a connection to that water system will be sought in Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 47 the future. Until this time, the proposed residence will only be serviced by a rainwater catchment system. NON-POTABLE AGRICULTURAL WATER The proposed residence does not include any landscaping which would require agricultural irrigation. The rainfall in this area is very plentiful, and the minimal landscaping that was proposed will be able to be irrigated naturally by rainwater. There are two existing non -potable or agricultural water systems in Waihole, the Waihole Irrigation System and the McCandless Pipe System. Any future activ ities on the hulehule parcels that may require agricultural irrigation will include proposed agricultural irrigation systems in future applications to the appropriate agencies for use. Waihole Irrigation System The Waihole Irrigation System crosses th e mauka portion of the property. The Waihole Irrigation System collects impounded dike groundwater from Kahana, Waikne, and Waihole Valleys and transports this water to agricultural water users in leeward Oahu . The Waihole Irrigation System is curren tly permitted by CWRM to collect and transport 15 MGD of groundwater. Existing water permits related to the Waihole Ditch total 12.57 MGD, leaving 2.43 MGD unpermitted. The unpermitted water currently back into the windward streams. There are curr ently several pending permit applications for this unpermitted water. However, those applications have been placed on hold for several months. The new applications are contentious because windward residents are advocating against allowing any new permits to transfer water to leeward Oahu . McCandless Pipe System Another existing private groundwater system in the vicinity of the property is the McCandless Pipe System, which diverts water from the Waianu Stream, a tributary of the Waihole Stream. Even though the McCandless system diverts water from the Waianu Stream, water in the system is considered ground water because it was originally established as a water reserve released from the Waihole Irrigation System for Waihole users. The McCandless Pipe System can provide up to 0.5 MGD of non - potable water to some of the farmers in Waihole Valley. Currently, some of the farmers are using the McCandless water for irrigation. However, because the system is not metered, there is no public information on t he current number of users and the amount of water they consume. The McCandless water system, which runs along Waihole Valley Road adjacent to the property, is maintained by a group of residents in Waihole- Waikne. Members of the Waihole- Waikne commu nity that use water from the McCandless system cooperate to conduct maintenance and do repairs on the system. SEWER SERVICE There is no municipal sewer service to the rural communities north of Kahaluu in the Ko'olaupoko District of Oahu . Consequently , homes in Waihe'e to Waikne use septic systems or cesspools. Residents in the area of the Kahaluu Neighborhood Board have voiced concern that leaking cesspools Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 48 may impact the surface water resources of the area. An individual septic system will be installed for the proposed residence. The Zwengs will be responsible for the long -term maintenance of the septic system. ROADS The property is accessible via two main access roads. The paved two -lane Waihole Valley Road borders the makai parcel to the southeast and provides the only vehicular access point to the proposed residence . The mauka parcel is accessible via the unpaved Waikne Valley Road, which traverses across the property all the way to Waikne Camp where an intake of the Waihole Irrigation System is located. The Waihole Valley Road is a public road that is owned by the HHFDC. The h ulehule Forest Conservancy received permission from the HHFDC for vehicular access to the makai parcel from Waihole Valley Road in a letter from HHFDC dated November 4, 2021. This letter grants permission for vehicular road access and use including for th e duration of construction activities with a caution that should any damage to the road occur during construction, hulehule Forest Conservancy will be responsible for repairing the road to its current condition. The Waikne Valley Road is a public road from the Kamehameha Highway until it reaches the property of the City and County of Honolulu (TMK 4 -8-006:008), at which point a locked gate is present across the road. This private road is legally utilized by local residents and landowners who have either an access agreement with the City or an easement recorded in their property deeds. The road is also legally utilized by the Agribusiness Development Corporation for the purpose of maintaining the Waihole Irrigation System. Illegal trespassing onto the subject property and the City lands by hunters and recreational off- road vehicles represents a significant concern. 4.4. EXISTING LAND USE LAND USE ON THE PROPERTY The makai parcel of the property is largely overgrown with trees and shrubs. Land uses on that parcel include the following activities: In the northeastern corner of the property, the Roberts family and relatives use the Waikne Valley Road to access their kuleana parcel (TMK 4 -8-006:009). Drivers of 4x4 vehicles access the northeastern portion o f the property for off -roading recreational use (unpermitted). The vast majority of the mauka parcel is forested and uses of the land are limited to the following activities: Access by the State Department of Agriculture, Agribusiness Development Corpor ation (ADC) for maintenance of the Waihole Irrigation System. The ADC has an access easement on the property for this maintenance. Access by pig hunters and recreational hikers (trespassing). Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 49 SURROUNDING LANDOWNERS AND LAND USES Land uses in the vici nity of the property are dominated by small farms and rural neighborhoods in the makai portions of valleys, and by large expanses of forested lands in mauka areas. The bulk of lands surrounding the property are owned and managed by various federal, state, and local government agencies, with the exception of one large private landowner. Surrounding landowners are described below: To the north of the property, the ahupuaa of Kahana is owned and managed by the State Department of Land and Natural Resources as a State Park. To the west of the property, across the crest of the Ko'olau Mountains is the Oahu Forest National Wildlife Refuge managed by the USFWS in the Waipi'o ahupuaa . The U.S. Army East Range is just north of the wildlife refuge, in the Wai' anae Uka ahupuaa . To the south of the property, about half of the Waihole ahupuaa is owned and managed as the Waihole Agriculture Park by the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC). The other half of the ahupuaa is managed by th e State Department of Land and Natural Resources, Division of Forestry and Wildlife (DOFAW) as a Forest Reserve. To the east of the property in Waikne Valley, the City and County of Honolulu owns most of the makai portion of the ahupuaa . The City previously intended to develop a nature park on the large vacant parcel adjacent to the property. However as a result of budget constraints, community conce rns, and a changing administration, this plan is no longer being pursued. The Department of Parks and Recreation currently manages the vacant parcel. The U.S. Marine Corps owns the parcel located adjacent to the property, just north of the makai parcel. The U.S. Marine Corps acquired title to the land in 1989 due to concerns associated with unexploded ordnances from decades of use as a missile- training -and-target area. The U.S. Marine Corps has been conducting ordnance survey and removal efforts, which m ay lead to the return of portions of the property to its previous owners, the Kamaka family, or to the public. To the northeast of the property, the largest part of the ahupuaa of Hakipuu and Ka'a'awa is privately owned by Kualoa Ranch Hawaii, Inc (\"Ku aloa Ranch\"). Kualoa Ranch operates a cattle ranch as well as a number of tourist attractions. Refer to Figure 1 9: Surrounding Landowners Map for a map of the large landowners in the region.

REQUIRED PERMITS AND APPROVALS State of Hawaii: Conservation District Use Permit Individual Waste water System Approval Road Access Approval City & County of Honolulu: Grubbing, Grading and Building Permits 4.6. RELATION T O FEDERAL , STATE AND LOCAL LAND USE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS GENERAL PLAN The General Plan for the City and County of Honolulu, a requirement of the City Charter, is a broad statement of objectives and policies to guide the City's future. The General Plan is a guide for all levels of government, private enterprise, neighborhood and citizen groups, organizations, and individual citizens in eleven areas of concern: population, economic activity, the natural environment, housing, transportation and utilities, energy, physical development and urban design, public safety, health and education, culture and recreation, and government operations and fiscal management. The General Plan is used as policy guidance in developing pla ns, programs, and legis lation. The proposed residence on the makai parcel of the property supports the following objectives of the General Plan (2002) : Population growth Objective C: To establish a pattern of population distribution that will allow the people of Oahu to live and work in harmony. Policy 3: Manage physical growth and development in the urban- fringe and rural areas so that: a. An undesirable spreading of development is prevented; and b. Their population densities are consistent with the character of development and environmental qualities desired for such areas. Discussion: The proposed residence would allow Mr. Zweng and his family to live on the same property as a proposed farm. One single -family residence per zoning lot in the Conservation District, in this ca se on a 327 -acre parcel, is consistent with the desired rural character of Waihole -Waikne Valley s. Economic activity Objective A: To promote employment opportunities that will enable all the people of Oahu to attain a decent standard of living. Policy 1 : Encourage the growth and diversification of Oahu's economic base. Policy 2: Encourage the development of small businesses and larger industries which will contribute to the economic and social well -being of Oahu residents. Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 52 Discussion: The proposed construction and occupation of a single -family home is in balance with the natural, cultural and social environment of the County, would create temporary construction jobs for local residents, and would indirectly boost the economy through con struction industry purchases from local suppliers. A multiplier effect takes place when these employees spend their income for food, housing, and other living expenses in the retail sector of the economy. Such activities are in keeping with the overall eco nomic development of the island. Natural Environment Objective A: To protect and preserve the natural environment. Policy 4: Require development projects to give due consideration to natural features such as slope, flood and erosion hazards, water - recharge areas, distinctive land forms, and existing vegetation. Objective C: To preserve and enhance the natural monuments and scenic views o f Oahu for the benefit of both residents and visitors. Discussion : The single -story r esidence will be sited to minimize impacts to the scenic views of Waikne Valley. Best management practices will be followed to minimize erosion hazards. Residents and visitors may be granted access to the property for recreational hiking. Physical De velopment and Urban Design Objective D: To maintain those development characteristics in the urban- fringe and rural areas which make them desirable places to live. Policy 4: Maintain rural areas as areas which are intended to provide environments supporti ve of lifestyle choices which are dependent on the availability of land suit able for small to moderate size agricultural pursuits, a relatively open and scenic setting, and/or a small town, country atmosphere consisting of communities which are small in si ze, v ery low density and low rise in character, and may contain a mixture of uses. Discussion: The proposed single -family residence on a working farm is consistent with the policy to allow for continued rural agricultural and residential communities on Oahu . SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PLAN The Ko'olaupoko Sustainable Communities Plan (SCP) is one of eight community -oriented plans required by the City Charter to implement objectives and policies set forth in the General Plan. Each of the eight plans guides development in one of eight districts on the island of Oahu . The Ko'olaupoko SCP is was updated in 2017 The original Ko'olaupoko SCP was developed in 1998 -2000. Land uses identified in the Kahaluu to Kualoa area in the Ko'olaupoko SCP are dominated by open space/preservation in mauka areas, and agriculture, parks, and low -density residential in the makai areas. The SCP identifies the mauka parcel as open space/preservati on area and the makai parcel agricultural area. Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 53 ZONING AND STATE LAND USE The City and County Land Use Ordinance (LUO) establishes land -use zoning and development regulations in accordance with the policies of the Oahu General Plan and Development Plans/Sustainable Communities Plans. The entire property is zoned as P -1: Restri cted Preservation District. The P -1 District covers all lands that are designated by the State as \"Conservation District\". Within the P -1 District, all land uses, structures, and development standards are governed by the Conservation District Rules of th e State's Department of Land and Natural Resources, Office of Conservation and Coastal Lands (OCCL). The entire makai parcel and the greater part of the mauka parcel are within the Conservation District's Resource Subzone. The purpose of this subzone is to ensure, with proper management, the sustainable use of the natural resources within this subzone. A number of uses can be permitted within this subzone, including agriculture, one single -family residence per lot, aquaculture, commercial forestry, bota nical gardens, etc. A Conservation District Use Permit is required for most major projects within the Conservation District. OTHER REGULATIONS AFFECTING PROPOSED ACTIVITIES There are several other regulatory requirements that may affect the proposed acti vities in the project area. These requirements are summarized in the below table . Table 1 - Other Regulations Affecting the Proposed Activities LAW OR GUIDANCE DOCUMENT GOVT LEVEL REQUIREMENTS AND PROHIBITED USES Endangered Species Act (ESA) Federal Regulates activities that may impact Federally -listed threatened and endangered plant and animal species, as well as their habitats. The law prohibits any action that causes a \"taking\" of any threatened or endangered species. A \"taking\" is defined as harassing, harming, pursuing, hunting, wounding, killing, trapping, capturing, or collecting. Grubbing, grading & stockpiling (ROH Chapter 14 -13 thru 16) City & County The City and County of Honolulu requires a permit for any grubbing, grading, and stockpiling (except small exempt quantities). Alternatively, land being managed in accordance with a Conservation Plan acceptable to the applicable Soil and Water Conservatio n District directors is exempt from this requirement. Actions that will require a Conservation Plan or grading and grubbing permit include: - Construction of access roads, - Land preparation for a farm, - Grading and grubbing for a residence . Historic Preservation (HRS Chapter 6E) State Regulates activities that may impact historic properties. Requires a survey to identify whether historic properties may be Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 54 impacted by a proposed action and the preparation of a preservation plan or a mitigation plan if a historic property may be affected. State Water Code (HRS Chapter 174C) State Regulates the use of surface water and groundwater in the State. Potential activities that would be subject to the requirements of the State Water Code include: - Groundwater well for crop irrigation - Spring or stream diversion for crop irrigation 4.7. CUMULATIVE IMPACTS The cumulative impact of the proposed project over time and in the context of the surrounding area is expected to be primarily positive. In addition to a single -family residence, long -term plans for the property include a farm, restora tion of native forest and 'elepaio habitat in the mauka portion of the valley, and restoration of the historic taro loi on Waikne Stream and Waikeekee Stream. These actions are consistent with past and present land uses, as well as the desire of commun ity members to perpetuate agriculture and the rural lifestyle of Waihole Valley. All uses and activities beyond the proposed single -family residence will be included in future Conservation District Use Applications for acceptance by the OCCL. Best Mana gement Practices will be implemented during road repairs, construction work, and occupation of the residence to avoid adverse impacts to soil, air and water quality in the Valley. By protecting important watershed area and allowing limited public access t o the property, the 'hulehule Forest Conservancy is maintaining and improving the environmental quality of the land and allowing for continued cultural practices in the area. The proposed residence is not expected to have significant impacts to roads, utilities or water supply in the Waihole -Waikne area . The Conservation District zoning limits residential development to one dwelling per lot, removing the concern of excessive development in this rural agricultural area. 5. SUMMARY OF IMPACTS AND MITIGATION 5.1. FINDINGS AND SUPPORTING REASONS Chapter 11 -200 1-13, Hawai' i Administrative Rules, outlines those factors agencies must consider when determining whether an Action has significant effects: (a) In considering the significance of potential environmental effects, agencies shall consider and evaluate the sum of effects of the proposed action on the quality of the environment. (b) In determining whether an action may have a significant effect on the environment, the agency shall consider every phase of a proposed action, the expected impacts, and Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 55 the proposed mitigation measures. In most instances, an action shall be determined to have a significant effect on the environment if it may: 1. Irrevocably commit a natural, cultural, or historic resource . No natural or cultural resources will be committed or lost from the con struction of the Zweng Residence. No rare or endangered native species of flora or fauna were identified in the project area. Archaeological studies have determined that several historic sites occur on the large 300+ acre parcel where the residence is prop osed, and none of these sites occur within the vicinity of the project area. No adverse effects to the historic sites will occur. Interviews with long -time residents and cultural descendants of the ahupuaa found no on -going traditional or customary practices within the vicinity of the project area. No valuable cultural resources and practices such as gathering, hunting, or access to ceremonial sites will be adversely affected in any way. The property owner is committed to allowing access to cultural and li neal descendants for traditional and customary practices should access be needed/requested in the future. 2. Curtail the range of beneficial uses of the environment. No restriction of beneficial uses will occur by residential use on this lot. 3. Conflict with the State's environmental policies or long- term environmental goals established by law . The State's long -term environmental policies are set forth in Chapter 344, HRS. The broad goals of this policy are to conserve natural resources and enhance the q uality of life. The scope of this project is minor and it is thus consistent with all elements of the State's long -term environmental policies. 4. Have a substantial adverse effect on the economic welfare, social welfare, or cultural practices of the comm unity and State. The project will not have any substantial effect on the economic or social welfare of the Waihole community or the State of Hawai'i. This project is likely to provide positive impacts on local industries, such as short -term employment opp ortunities during construction of the residence. 5. Have a substantial adverse effect on public health. The project will not affect public health and safety. Wastewater will be disposed of in conformance with State Department of Health regulations. 6. Involve adverse secondary impacts, such as population changes or effects on public facilities. The proposed project is of a small scale and will not produce any significant secondary impacts, such as population changes or effects on public facilities. 7. Involve a substantial degradation of environmental quality. The proposed project is of a small scale and therefore will not contribute to environmental degradation. 8. Be individually limited but cumulatively have substantial adverse effect upon the environm ent or involves a commitment for larger actions. The adverse effects of the building of a single -family residence are limited to minor, temporary disturbance s to traffic, air quality, noise, and visual quality during construction. Adverse effects on traffi c will be mitigated by providing on -site parking for any vehicles during construction, and strict adherence to all traffic regulations and posted speed limits . There are no scheduled major government or private projects in construction or plann ed in the ar ea, and no accumulation of adverse construction effects are expected. Other than the Best Management Practices Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 56 that will be incorporated to prevent the adverse effects during construction listed above, no special mitigation measures should be required to counteract the small adverse cumulative effect. 9. Have a substantial adverse effect on a rare, threatened, or endangered species, or its habitat. The site has been surveyed for threatened and endangered plants, and none are present. This project will include invasive species removal and landscaping with native plants and non -invasive naturalized plants to ensure no adverse impacts to native species or h abitats. No rare, threatened or endangered species of fauna are known to exist on or near the property. Impacts to the Hawaiian Ho ary Bat will be mitigated through seasonal timing of vegetation removal. Minimal exterior lighting is planned, will be shielde d and will consist of blue -deficient lighting such as filtered LED lights or amber LED lights, with a Correlated Color Temperature (CCT) of 2700 Kelvin. This will reduce the risk that transiting threatened or endangered seabirds may be attracted to and then disoriented by the lighting. 10. Have a substantial adverse effect on air or water quality or ambient noise levels. No substantial effects to air, water, or ambient noise will occur. Short -term effects will occur during construction and will be mitigate d using best practices . The makai parcel along Waihole Valley Road is bordered by only one parcel with a dwelling. The property is otherwise bordered on three sides with no nearby dwellings. Impacts from the effects of the short- term construction activiti es will be further limited due to the rural location of the property and lack of surrounding dwellings. Erosion and sedimentation impacts will be avoided by implementation of Best Management Practices during grading and grubbing, which will occur in a limited area. 11. Have a substantial adverse effect on or be likely to suffer damage by being located in an environmentally sensitive area such as a flood plain, tsunami zone, sea level rise exposure area, beach, erosion -prone area, geologically hazardous land, estuary, fresh water, or coastal waters. The proposed residence is not located in an identified flood zone nor will it affect one. The project area is located at over 300 feet above sea level and is also located quite a distance from and on high ground between the nearby Waianu and Waikeekee Streams with no history of flooding at the residence previously located on the site. Therefore, there is no risk of flood risk or tsunami hazard for the proposed residence. The project area is located over one mile from the nearest shoreline and will not be affected by sea level rise. 12. Have a substantial adverse effect on scenic vistas and view planes, during day or night, identified in county or state plans or studies. No protected scenic views are located near by or will be affected in any way. The proposed use is consistent with the surrounding community, which includes residential and agricultural uses . The proposed residence is sited approximately 200 feet farther inland from Waihole Valley Road than the previous residence structure on the makai parcel, which was removed. The former structure was a two -story building located within 100 feet of the nearest property line. The proposed residence is a single- story structure that is located an additional 200 feet from the nearest property line, which will make this structure significantly less visible to neighboring residences and from the Waihole Valley Road. Only minimal exterior lighting is planned, and it will be shielded and will consist of blue - deficient lig hting such as filtered LED lights or amber LED lights, with a Correlated Color Temperature Zweng Family Residence - Draft Environmental Assessment 57 (CCT) of 2700 Kelvin. This will protect dark skies and will reduce the risk to threatened or endangered seabirds that may be attracted to and then disoriented by the lighting. 13. Require substantial energy consumption or emit substantial greenhouse gases . Negligible amounts of energy input and greenhouse gas emission s will be requ ired for construction and occupation of the residence. The residence is designed as a single structure supporting efficient use of energy and materials and facilitating natural ventilation and lighting. The residence will have roof mounted photovoltaic pan els to decrease greenhouse gas emissions . Energy -efficient appliances will be used throughout the house. 5.2. ANTICIPATED DETERMINATION The applicants expect that the State of Hawaii, Department of Land and Natural Resources, will determine that the proposed action will not significantly alter the environment, as impacts will be minimal, and that this agency will accordingly issue a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI). This determination will be reviewed based on comments to the Draft EA, and the Final EA will present the final determination. APPEN DIX A: Waikne Valley Botanical Survey Oahu Hawaii (Lau 2012) Zweng DEA Appendices Page 1 of 317Waikne Valley Botanical Survey Oahu, Hawaii Prepared for: hulehule Forest Conservancy, LLC Kailua, Hawai 96734 By: Joel Lau July 2012 Zweng DEA Appendices Page 2 of 317Lau, 2012 1 INTRODUCTION/DESCRIPTION OF THE AREA This report presents the findings of a botanical survey of mountainous lands in Waikne Valley, O`ahu, Hawai`i that are proposed for native forest management and restoration by the `hulehule Forest Conservancy, and of other lands in the valley bottom proposed for the cultivation of cacao ( Theobroma cacao ). The primary objectives of the field studies were to: 1.Provide a description of the vegetation; 2.Compile a list of the vascular plant taxa seen on the survey. 3.Search for plant taxa listed as endangered or threatened by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, plant taxa that are currently proposed for listing, or are candidates for listing. 4.Search for plant taxa that have no federal status, but are nevertheless of conservation concern. 5.Identify threats to the native biota of the area, such as the major invasive weed threats and incipient weeds. Property owned by the `hulehule Forest Conservancy is made up of two land parcels that lie within the ahupuaa of Waikne in the Ko olaupoko district (Figure 1, Appendix A). Both parcels sit on the mauka (mountain) side of the ahupua a with Pu uhulehule and Pu`ukoiele to the north of the property and the Koolau summit to the west of the property (Figure 1, Appendix A). Within these parcels, two proposed project areas are designated for native plant restoration along with four smaller areas allotted for cacao farming (Figure 2, Appendix A). Two separate areas are proposed to be managed for the perpetuation of native Hawaiian ecosystems and the native plants and animals they contain, and for the restoration of native ecosystems in the portions of the areas that are no longer dominated by native plants. The northern restoration area is the larger of the two areas and includes 166 acres. It extends from the bottom of Waikne Valley up to the crest of the ridge that divides Waikne Valley from Kahana Valley to the north (Figure 2 , Appendix A). Its elevations range from about 300 feet in the valley bottom to 1,683 feet at Pu`ukoiele, which is a peak on the ridge dividing Waikne and Kahana Valleys. The south ern restoration area includes 110 acres. It is located in the head of Waikne Valley, and extends from 520 to 1,620 feet in elevation (Figure 2 , Appendix A). Both areas include much steeply sloped terrain. Four separate areas constitute the cacao farmin g areas, which are located in the lower elevations of Waikne Valley, and include a total of 49 acres. These areas consist of gently sloped land in between more steeply sloped gulches. SURVEY METHODS Prior to the field survey, a search was made for any records of rare and endangered plants found in the survey areas, in the neighboring areas, and in the general area. Information from the Hawai`i Biodiversity and Mapping Program and the Bishop Museum was reviewed. The survey was conducted in April to May 2012. A total of seven non-consecutive days were spent surveying the northern restoration area (3 days) the southern restoration area (3 days) and the cacao farming areas (1 day). The survey was conducted on foot, utilizing few existing trails as well as going into areas where there were no trails. Off trail routes often followed ridge tops, gulch bottoms, or streambeds. The full range of vegetation and habitat types within the survey areas were sampled. Zweng DEA Appendices Page 3 of 317Lau, 2012 2 In order to maximize the chances of finding rare and endangered plants, the survey was concentrated in the areas judged to have the most potential for these plants. These high potential areas were often those with a high diversity of native plant taxa in the upper elevations of the survey areas. Also judged to have a high potential for rare and endangered plant taxa were the habitats in the gulch bottoms. Plant taxa were mostly identified in the field. For the plants that could not be positively identified in the field, collections were made for later determination. The plant taxa included in the species list were the observed native plants, the non-native plants that are known to be naturalized, and any non-native plants that were observed to be spreading. Not included were the various planted ornamental plants present in the survey areas that were persisting after being planted, but not were not observed to be spreading. Also, there are currently inhabited residences as well as currently cultivated crops in the southern cacao farming areas. The various plants planted around those residences and the various crop species still under cultivation in the proposed cacao farming area were also not included in the species list. Included in the species list are a few plant taxa that were observed only outside of the survey areas but were thought to be worthy of mention; these taxa are indicated in the species list as being observed only outside of the survey area boundaries. DESCRIPTION OF THE VEGETATION Restoration Areas Both of the restoration areas contain native dominated and non-native dominated areas (Figure 5, Appendix A). The northern restoration area has a greater percentage of native dominated vegetation than the southern restoration area however; there are areas in the upper elevation portions of the southern restoration area where the vegetation is almost completely native. In general, in both of the restoration areas, the lower elevations tend to be more alien dominated, and the gulch bottoms are mostly alien dominated. The native vegetation of both of the forest restoration areas ranges from mesic to wet. Portions of the native-dominated vegetation of the restoration areas, especially in the northern restoration area, are dominated by uluhe ( Dicranopteris linearis ). Such areas are blanketed with a layer of the fern forming an impenetrable mat 1 or 2 meters thick, with scattered native trees sticking out of the mat. Uluhe dominated areas range from the lower gulch slopes to the ridge crests. In other areas the common forms of tree ` are co-dominant with uluhe. There are some areas, especially near the ridge tops, where uluhe is lacking and `hi`a lehua is the only dominant. In native vegetation ar eas not dominated or co-dominated by uluhe the native tree canopy is denser, and there is a greater diversity of native shrub and groundcover species. In the lower elevations of the northern restoration area, there are areas where hala (Pandanus tectorius) is abundant enough to be considered a co-dominant or a dominant species. In the northern restoration area, there is a fair amount of koa ( Acacia koa ) in the lower elevations, but it is not a dominant species. In the southern restoration area there are also some trees of it in the lower elevations. The common to occasional native trees of the native forests on the gulch slopes and on the ridges of the two forest restoration areas seen on this survey were lama ( Diospyros sandwicensis ), ). Occasional to uncommon native trees seen on the survey were the native area), and mmaki (Pipturus albidus ). Zweng DEA Appendices Page 4 of 317Lau, 2012 3 Common to occasional shrubs seen in the restoration areas calycinum , V. chamissoi ) was fairly common at all restoration areas, and hpu`u `i`i ( Cibotium menziesii ) was occasional in the upper elevations of the two areas. Common to occasional native vines seen in the restoration areas were occasional native epiphytic (growing on trees) ferns and fern allies seen in the restoration areas were hoe a Mui ( native plant taxa were restricted or were most common in the gulch bottoms of the two restoration areas. Included among these were the combination C. laxiflora x C. propinqua . Native ferns found mainly introduced plants seen on the survey of the restoration areas included the tree kukui ( Aleurites moluccana ), which was a dominant gulch bottoms, and ti ( Cordyline fruticosa ), which was common in some areas. A single stand of the Polynesian introduced bamboo ( Schizostachyum glaucifolium ) was seen in the southern restoration area. Another Polynesian introduced tree, kamani (Calophyllum inophyllum ), was seen in the southern restoration area, but these were evidently planted sometime in the early 1900's. A single plant of the cul turally important Polynesian plant kava ( Piper methysticum ), was seen alongside a stream in the northern restoration area. A few plants of the taro relative `ape ( Alocasia macrorrhizos ) were seen in the gulch bottoms of the southern restoration area. Hau (Hibiscus tiliaceus ) is a tree whose branches form a tangled, almost impenetrable mass. The species is thought to be either a native plant or a Polynesian introduced plant. It was seen in both restoration Zweng DEA Appendices Page 5 of 317Lau, 2012 4 areas, with a large area of the main gulch bottom in the northern restoration area dominated by the species. Common Invasive Weeds in the Restoration Areas Albizia ( Falcataria moluccana ), which grows into a large, tall tree, is a major non-native canopy dominant in the gulch bottoms in both restoration areas, and it can be found additionally on the gulch slopes up to the ridge tops. The tree koka ( Bischofia javanica ) is very common particularly in the SRA, dominating some of the gulch bottoms and extending up to the ridge tops. The tree white moho (Heliocarpus popayanensis ) is common in both restoration areas extending from the gulch bottoms to the ridge tops. Bingabing ( Macaranga mappa ) is a tree that was seen only in the southern restoration area, where it is a dominant tree in some gulch bottoms and lower gulch slopes. Large mature trees of octopus tree (Schefflera actinophylla ) are not yet very common in the restoration areas, but numerous seedlings and saplings, often epiphytic, can be found throughout the restoration areas as the seeds are apparently being spread by fruit eating birds. Shoebutton ardisia ( Ardisia elliptica ) is a small tree that is common in some areas of both of the restoration areas. Its seeds are also apparently being dispersed by fruit eating birds, and young plants of this species can be found throughout the restoration areas. There are areas in both restoration areas where strawberry guava ( Psidium cattleianum ) has become a dominant understory species. It is not spreading as rapidly as the weed species whose seeds are being spread by fruit eating birds. Koster's curse ( Clidemia hirta var. hirta ) is a very common to dominant understory shrub in both restoration areas. The species may have already spread into its entire potential habitat, and is possibly no longer increasing in numbers. Cacao Farming Areas Much of the acreage of the areas proposed for the cultivation of cacao are lands that were formerly utilized as pasture lands, but have not been used as such for at least two or three decades. There are still currently occupied residences on the large southern cacao farming area, and portions of that area are still being utilized for the cultivation of various crops. The parts of the cacao farming areas that have not been utilized for agricultural purposes in recent years are dominated by non-native plant species. There are small areas of native dominated vegetation in the general area of the cacao farming areas, but these areas are generally on the steeper gulch slopes outside of the cacao farming area boundaries. Parts of the cacao farming areas are dominated by strawberry guava ( Psidium cattleianum ), growing in thick, impenetrable stands. The areas not dominated by strawberry guava are more open, with various tree species growing amongst alien grasses, shrubs, a nd herbs. Non-native tree species aside from strawberry guava seen on this or a coconut ( Cocos nucifer), royal dominant grass in broomsedge or yellow bluestem ( Andropogon virginicus ). Shrubs and Koster's curse ( Clidemia hirta var. hirta ). bamboo orchid ( Arundina graminifolia Zweng DEA Appendices Page 6 of 317Lau, 2012 5 The most common remnant native plants seen in the cacao f arming areas were the trees the tree koa ( Acacia koa ), AND RECOMMENDATIONS No rare plant taxa or taxa federally listed as endangered or threatened were found on this survey. However, there is still some potential for undiscovered rare plant occurrences to found, and it is recommended that further searching for rare plant taxa be conducted. Although no rare plants are currently known from the restoration areas, the areas are suitable for the reintroduction of rare plant taxa historically known from the general area or known from similar habitats in neighboring areas. The following are some plant taxa that would benefit from being outplanted in the Waik ne Valley restoration areas. The first group of taxa are those of high conservation concern that are especially relevant to Waikne Valley because of their restricted historical ranges that include Waikne Valley. The second group of plant taxa includes those of high conservation concern that are relevant to conservation efforts throughout the Ko`olau Mountains. The third group includes taxa that are of lower conservation concern, that would be appropriate for outplanting in Waikane. Group 1: Taxa of high conservation concern that are especially relevant to Waikne Cyanea truncata (Rock) Rock (hh; federally listed as endangered) - Cyanea truncata is a shrub that is unbranched or branched from the base. It is endemic to the windward Ko`olau Mountains. No plants of the species were known to be extant when a single plant was discovered in 1998 in the Hau`ula area. That plant died about two years after it was discovered, however, seeds were collected from it before it died. Offspring from that plant are still in cultivation and in outplantings. A new wild population of three plants was discovered in 2004 in Kahana on the seaward extension of the ridge system between Kahana and Waikne Valleys. Two of those plants are still alive, and the genetic ma terial of the population has been secured (Susan Ching, personal communication, Feb. 1, 2012). Cyanea truncata has been recorded from gulches against the main spine of the Ko`olau Mountains as well as in two of the gulches on the seaward extension of the ridge between Kahana and Waikne Valleys, so the gulch bottoms of both of the restoration areas in Waikne shou ld be suitable for the outplantings of this species. Cyrtandra kaulantha H. St. John & Storey (ha`iwale; proposed for listing as federally endangered) - Cyrtandra kaulantha is a shrub that is narrowly endemic to the windward central Ko`olau Mountains from Waikne Valley to Waihole Valley. There are only seven wild plants known to remain in a single gulch along the Waihole Ditch Trail between the valleys of Waikne and Waihole (Susan Ching, personal communication, June 28, 2012). A vegetative Cyrtandra plant seen by the principal investigator in April 2011 in Waike`eke`e Gulch just to the south of the southern restoration area appeared be a plant of C. kaulantha based on its vegetative characteristics. The plant is outside of the southern restoration area but on the property of the `hulehule Forest Conservancy. Cyrtandra kaulantha has proven easy to propagate from leaf cuttings (Susan Ching, personal communication, Feb. 1, 2012). Because so few wild plants are known to remain, this individual in a different drainage from the other known plants of C. kaulantha potentially represents an important addition to the conserved genetic material of the species. Zweng DEA Appendices Page 7 of 317Lau, 2012 6 Leaf material from this individual should be collected for propagation so that the resulting plants can be positively identified when they come into flower in cultivation and so that their genetic material can be conserved should they prove to be C. kaulantha . The species has been found only in the very wet gulches right up against the main spine of the Ko`olau Mountains, and as such, only the southern restoration area appears to contain suitable habitat for this species. Delissea subcordata Gaudich. subsp. subcordata subsp. subcordata is now considered to include only certain historically collected specimens from the southern and central Ko`olau Mountains. All of the plants of Delissea known to be extant in the Wai`anae Mountains are now assigned to the species D. waianaeensis . No plants of D. subcordata subsp. subcordata are currently known to be extant. However, should the taxon be rediscovered, Waikne Valley would be a good place for outplantings of the taxon since several of the historically collected specimens of this taxon were collected in the valley, most recently in 1934. Lysimachia filifolia C. N. Forbes & Lydgate (no common name; federally listed as endangered) - Lysimachia filifolia is endemic to the islands of Kaua`i and O`ahu. However, the plants on Kaua`i may prove to constitute a separate taxon from the O`ahu plants since the plants on Kaua`i grow to be much larger than the O`ahu plants (Susan Ching, personal communication, June 28, 2012). On O`ahu it has been found only in Waihole Valley and in one other gulch between Waihole and Waikane Valleys. The O`ahu plants occur only on the faces of nearly vertical dry or dripping waterfalls. At least one of the waterfalls seen on this survey in the southern restoration area seemed possibly suitable for outplantings of this species. Additional survey of the southern restoration area may result in the finding of other apparently suitable waterfalls. Pritchardia lowreyana Rock (loulu; no federal status) Pritchardia lowreyana is a native fan palm endemic to Moloka`i and the Ko`olau Mountains of O`ahu. The only currently known wild P. lowreyana plants in Ko`olau Mountains are located only 0.7 kilometers (0.45 miles) from the boundary of the northern restoration area, where there is a grove of six mature plants and additional immature plants. In order to minimize the risk of hybridization, the species should not be planted close to natural or out-planted populations of other species of Pritchardia . Since P. martii occurs naturally in the SRA, but no naturally occurring Pritchardia plants are known from the NRA, the NRA could be reserved for outplantings of P. lowreyana , while the SRA could be reserved for outplantings of P. martii . Outplantings of P. lowreyana could also be tried outside of the restoration areas in the lower elevations of Waikne Valley, as the natural range of the species may have included lower elevations in the valley bottoms. The species may have originally occurred in the lowlands primarily where groundwater was available to the plants, such as in gulch bottoms, along streams, and around springs. A note concerning Cyrtandra crenata H. St. John & Storey (ha`iwale; federally listed as endangered) - The only recorded location for Cyrtandra crenata is along the windward leg of the Schofield-Waikne Trail. However, Cyrtandra crenata is now recognized to be a hybrid between C. hawaiensis and C. subumbellata (Warren L. Wagner, personal communication, May 18, 2010). Group 2: Taxa of high conser vation concern that are relevant to Waikne as well as to conservation efforts throughout the Ko`olau Mountains Acacia koaia Hillebr. (koai`e; no federal status) and intermediates between A. koa A. Gray and A. koaia (no federal status) - Acacia koaia is a rare plant endemic to Kaua`i, O`ahu, Moloka`i, Lna`i, Maui, and the island of Hawai`i. It is usually a small tree. Acacia koa is similar to A. koaia , but it is usually a much larger tree. Naturally occurring A. koaia is known from only a single location on O`ahu, namely in Zweng DEA Appendices Page 8 of 317Lau, 2012 7 Wailupe Valley in the southern Ko`olau Mountains. All of the plants at that location look identical, and they appear to have been clonally reproduced by root suckering ultimately from a single original plant. The genetic material of that apparent clone has not yet been safeguarded in cultivation or in outplantings. Intermediates between A. koa and A. koaia have been found in several areas of the Ko`olau Mountains. One of the areas where they have been found is in Kahana Valley just to the north of Waikne Valley. Outplantings of A. koaia and/or the A. koa-koaia intermediates could be tried in lowest elevations of the southern restoration area or in areas seaward of the restoration areas. Cyanea crispa (Gaudich.) Lammers, Givn as endangered) - Cyanea crispa is a shrub with somewhat fleshy stems that is unbranched or branched from the base. It is endemic to the Ko`olau Mountains. There are still widely scattered populations of the species known to remain in various parts of the mountain range. Plants of this species still survive in the gulches on the seaward extension of the ridge system between Kahana and Waikne Valleys. The gulch bottoms in the mid - and high elevation portions of the southern restoration area may constitute the most suitable habitat within the two restoration areas in Waikne for this pu`uko`a, pko`a; status) - The Hawaiian plants of C. odoratus are considered by Koyama (1990) to represent short-lived perennial sedge. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands as well as to many other regions of the world. There is a wide diversity in the morphology of the Hawaiian specimens. Mature Hawaiian plants can be as short as 15 centimeters tall or grow to be over 1.5 meters tall. The non-Hawaiian plants are extremely variable as well, and taxonomic study of C. odoratus complex world-wide could possibly result in the recognition of taxa endemic to Hawai`i. No wild populations of C. odoratus are known to be extant in Hawai`i. However, there are plants of Hawaiian origin in cultivation, all of which originated from seeds collected by the principal investigator in 1998 from a few plants found growing at a seep along the Maunawili Trail on the windward side of the southern Ko`olau Mountains. Although the 1998 finding of C. odoratus constitutes the only record of the species in Hawai`i since 1939, it seems likely to the principal investigator that the species still persists in the wild in multiple locations throughout the Hawaiian Islands, and efforts should be made to find any surviving plants. This species could be planted in either of the restoration areas in its favored habitats, namely at springs and seeps, and along streams. Cyrtandra kalichii Wawra (ha`iwale; no federal status) - Cyrtandra kalichii is a shrub endemic to the Ko`olau Mountains and the Ka`ala area in the northern Wai`anae Mountains. It is one of the rarer of the Cyrtandra species occurring on O`ahu. There is at least one individual growing along the Kahana section of the Waihole Ditch Trail. There also used to be a plant of this speci es in a gulch on the Kahana side of the seaward portion of the ridge system between Kahana and Waikne Valleys, but that plant died a few years ago. However, that area should be searched for additional currently unknown plants. The gulch bottoms and lower gulch slopes of both restoration areas seem to constitute good habitat for this species. Embelia pacifica Hillebr. (kilioe; no federal status) - Embelia perennial vine endemic to Kaua`i, O`ahu, Moloka`i, Lna`i, Maui, and Hawai` i. There is only a single currently known plant of this species in the Ko`olau Mountains. The plant was found by the principal investigator in May 2011 in Kaluanui in the windward northern Ko`olau Mountains. It was growing in wet forest, which is unusual for the species on O`ahu. All of the plants of E. pacifica known in the Wai`anae Mountains occur in mesic forests. All parts of the two restoration areas seem to constitute appropriate habitat for this species depending on the stock that is outplanted. The Kaluanui stock seems to be appropriate for the wetter portions of the restoration areas, while stock from the Wai`anae Mountains may be more appropriate for the lower, drier portions of the restoration areas. Zweng DEA Appendices Page 9 of 317Lau, 2012 8 Eurya sandwicensis A. Gray (nini, wnini; no federal status) - Eurya sandwicensis is a shrub or a small tree endemic to Kaua`i, O`ahu, Moloka`i, Maui, and the island of Hawai`i. There are only about seven plants of E. sandwicensis currently known on O`ahu. All except one of these are in the Ko`olau Mountains. A plant of this species was seen by the principal investigator in 1980 on the seaward extension of the Kahana-Waikne ridge system, on the ridge between Kahana Valley and Makaua Gulch. That area should be searched for the plant seen in 1980 and any other individuals of the species that may survive in the area. The ridge tops and upper ridge slopes in the upper elevation portions of both restoration areas seem to be suitable for outplantings of this species. Exocarpos gaudichaudii A. DC. (heau; no federal status) - Exocarpos gaudichaudii is a shrub or a small tree endemic to O`ahu, Moloka`i, Lna`i, Maui, and the island of Hawai`i. The species is rare throughout its range. There are fewer than 10 currently known plants of this species in the Ko`olau Mountains. There are three currently known plants of this species on the windward side of the Ko`olau Mountains. All three are in the Hau`ula area in the northern part of the mountain range. The upper ridge slopes and ridge crests of the northern restoration area seem to best match the conditions where the plants in the Hau`ula area are growing. Gardenia mannii H. St. John & Kuykendall (n`, nn; federally listed as endangered) - Gardenia mannii is a tree endemic to both mountain ranges of O`ahu. Fewer individuals of this species are known to survive in the Wai`anae Mountains than in the Ko`olau Mountains, where the species can still be found in various areas throughout the mountain range. However, the number of individuals in the Ko`olau Mountains has declined significantly over the last two or three decades. The species has been recorded at more than one location on the ridge system between Kahana and Ka`a`awa Valleys within the last two decades, and its persistence there should be confirmed. Outplantings of this species could be tried in the upper elevations of both of the restoration areas in Waikne a tree endemic to Kaua`i, O`ahu, Moloka`i, Maui, and the island of Hawai`i. There may be fewer than 20 plants of this native tree species currently known on O`ahu, most of which are in two populations in the Ko`olau Mountains. There is habitat that is seemingly appropriate for this species in the lower elevations of both of the restoration areas. Joinvillea ascendens Gaudich. ex Brongn. & Gris subsp. Joinvillea ascendens subsp. ascendens is a large, grass-like, clumping perennial plant. The subspecies is endemic to Kaua`i, O`ahu, Moloka`i, Maui, and Hawai`i. The most appropriate material to use in outplantings in the two restoration areas in Waikne Valley may be material originating from plants of the species in the Wai`anae Mountains rather than in the Ko`olau Mountains, since all of the plants known to be extant in the Ko`olau Mountains grow in extremely wet habitats on or near the main dividing ridge of the mountain range, habitats that are much wetter than the wettest parts of the two restoration areas. All of the known plants in the Wai`anae Mountains are in mesic habitats that seem to be fairly similar to habitats in the mesic, lower elevation portions of the two restoration areas. Lindsaea repens (Bory) Thwaites var. macraeana (Hook. & Arn.) C. (no common name; no federal status) - Lindsaea repens var. macraeana is a rare wet forest fern with a creeping rhizome that is either terrestrial or epiphytic. The taxon is endemic to most of the main Hawaiian Islands. One of the locations where it has been seen in recent years is in Kahana Valley, along the trail that connects the Schofield- Waikne Trail to the Kahana Valley portion of the Waihole Ditch Trail. The higher, wetter parts of the southern restoration area appear to be the most appropriate habitat for this species. Neraudia melastomifolia Gaudich. (ma`aloa, ma`oloa, `oloa; no federal status) - There has been only one observation of this native shrub species in the Ko`olau Mountains in the last two decades. The Zweng DEA Appendices Page 10 of 317Lau, 2012 9 observation was of a single plant on the windward side of the mountain range opposite the land section of Waimano on the leeward side of the mountain range. If no other plants are discovered in the Ko`olau Mountains in the coming years, plants originating from the Wai`anae Mountains may have to be used in any outplanting trials in Waikne. Various areas of both restoration areas seem to be suitable for this species, depending on the stock utilized. Nothocestrum longifolium A. Gray (`aiea; no federal status) - At most, only about 6-8 plants of this native tree species are currently known in the Ko`olau Mountains. The species was known to occur on the seaward extension of the ridge system between Kahana and Waikne Valleys, namely in Makaua Gulch, into at least the 1990's or maybe past the year 2000, but those plants appear to have died. The area should be searched for any additional unknown plants that might still survive. Various areas of both restoration areas seem to be suitable for this species, depending on the stock utilized. Pteralyxia macrocarpa (Hillebr.) K. Schum (kaulu; proposed for listing as federally endangered) - Pteralyxia macrocarpa is a native tree species endemic to O`ahu. It is more common in the Wai`anae Mountains than in the Ko`olau Mountains. Fewer than 30 mature individuals of the species are known to survive in the Ko`olau Mountains. Included among these individuals are several that are known from the seaward extension of the ridge system between Kahana and Waikne Valleys, in the drainages of Mak aua and Kahana. Outplantings of this species could be tried in the lower elevations of both of the restoration areas. Strongylodon ruber Vogel (nuku `i`iwi, k a long-lived woody vine endemic to Kaua`i, O`ahu, Moloka`i, Maui, and Hawai`i. A single plant of this species in Plolo Valley is the only wild plant known to be extant in the Ko`olau Mountains. Habitat that is seemingly appropriate for this species exists in both of the restoration areas. If no more plants of the species are discovered in the Ko`olau Mountains in the coming years, augmentation of outplantings of the Plolo Valley stock with stock from outside the Ko`olau Mountains should be considered. Plants originating from wet forest areas on the neighbor islands may be more appropriate for outplanting in the restoration areas in Waikne Valley than plants originating from the Wai`anae Mountains, which occur in habitats that may be drier than any of the habitats within the two restoration areas. Group 3: Taxa that are appropriate for outplanting in Waikane that are of lower conservation concern Asplenium insiticium Brack. (no common name; no federal status) - Asplenium insiticium is a fern native to all of the major Hawaiian Islands, and is also native to Fiji and New Caledonia. The species was not seen on this survey within the boundaries of the restoration areas, but it occurs along the Waihole Ditch Trail to the south of Waikne Valley. The form of A. insiticium occurring along the Wai hole Ditch Trail appears to favor the gulch bottoms and it appears to grow primarily epiphytically on the trunks or main limbs of trees. Diospyros hillebrandii (Seem.) Fosberg (lama; no federal status) - This tree species is endemic to O`ahu and Kaua`i. No plants of this species were seen on this survey. It is occasional in Hakipu`u Valley, which adjoins the northeastern side of Waikne Valley. The lower elevations of both of the restoration areas seem to contain suitable habitat for the species. Dodonaea viscosa Jacq. ( D. sandwicensis Sherff type) (`a`ali`i; status) - The D. sandwicensis type of `a`ali`i is a shrub or a small tree. It was not found on this survey, but two individuals of it are known to be present in the northern restoration area. It seems that the existing population of this type of `a`ali`i within the restoration area may need to be augmented if it is to persist. Propagules for augmentation of the population could be obtained further seaward on the ridge system between Kahana Zweng DEA Appendices Page 11 of 317Lau, 2012 10 and Waikne Valleys, where this type of `a`ali`i is more common than within the northern restoration area. Hibiscus arnottianus A. Gray subsp. punaluuensis (Skottsb.) D. M. Bates (koki`o ke`oke`o, no federal status) - This white flowered native hibiscus grows into a medium sized tree. It is endemic to parts of the Ko`olau Mountains. The taxon was seen on this survey only in the northern restoration area. Suitable habitat for it appears to be available in the gulch bottoms of the southern restoration area as well, in addition to areas in the northern restoration area where it is currently absent. Ochrosia compta K. Schum. (hlei; no federal status) - This native tree species is endemic to the islands of O`ahu and Moloka`i. No plants were seen on this survey, but the species is known to occur on the seaward portion of the ridge system between Kahana and Waikne Valleys. Seemingly sui table habitat for the species is found in the lower elevation portions of both of the restoration areas. Peperomia membranacea Hook. & Arn. (`ala`ala wai nui; no federal status) - Peperomia membranacea is a native herb endemic to Kaua`i, O`ahu, Moloka`i, Maui, and Hawai`i. It grows terrestrially or epiphytically. It is common in many parts of the Ko`olau Mountains, but it was not seen on this survey within the boundaries of the restoration areas. It is known to occur along the Waihole Ditch Trail to the south of Waikne Valley. There is appropriate habitat for this species in both of the restoration areas, primarily in the gulch bottoms and on the lower gulch slopes. Peperomia oahuensis C. DC. (`ala`ala wai nui; no federal status) - This herb species is endemic to O`ahu and Kaua`i. It usually grows epiphytically on the trunks and main limbs of trees. The species is currently known to occur along the Kahana Valley section of the Waihole Ditch Trail. The gulch bottoms of both of the restoration areas seem to constitute appropriate habitat for this species. In the Ko`olau Mountains the species occurs primarily on the trunks and branches of the native white flowered hibiscus, Hibiscus arnottianus subsp. punaluuensis , which was seen on this survey in one of the gulch bottoms of northern restoration area. Establishing that taxon of hibiscus in the southern restoration area, and outplanting it in the parts of the northern restoration area where it is currently absent would improve the chances for the successful establishment of populations of P. oahuensis in the restoration areas. Rauvolfia sandwicensis A. DC. (hao; no federal status) - Rauvolfia is a tree endemic to Kaua`i, O`ahu, Moloka`i, Lna`i, Maui, and Hawai`i. No plants of this species were seen within the boundaries of the two restoration areas on this survey. However, three individuals were seen just outside the boundaries of the southern restoration area. The lower, drier portions of both of the restoration areas appear to constitute suitable habitat for this species. Santalum freycinetianum Gaudich. (sandalwood, `iliahi; no federal status) - The native tree species S. freycinetianum is now considered to be endemic to the island of O`ahu. The species is more common on the leeward side of the Ko`olau Mountains than on the windward side. The known plants of the species on the windward side of the Ko`olau Mountains closest to Waikne are in the Hau`ula area in the northern part of the mountain range. The lower elevations of both of the restoration areas seem to constitute suitable habitat for the species. Urera glabra (Hook. & Arn.) Wedd. (puhe; no federal status) - Urera glabra is a small tree endemic to Kaua`i, O`ahu, Moloka`i, Lana`i, Maui, and the island of Hawai`i. In the Ko`olau Mountains it is locally common, but in many areas it is uncommon to absent. No plants of this species was seen on this survey. However, both restoration areas seem to contain appropriate habitat for this species, particularly in the lower elevation gulch bottoms. Extant populations of the species can be found in various locations along the windward side of the Ko`olau Mountains. Zweng DEA Appendices Page 12 of 317Lau, 2012 11 Weed Recommendations An invasive alien plant species, the Australian tree fern ( Sphaeropteris cooperi ) was seen along the Schofield-Waikne Trail outside of the restoration areas. This incipient occurrence should be eradicated to prevent its spread to other parts of the valley. Other invasive species that may be considered to be incipient that should be considered for eradication are African tulip tree ( Ficus platypoda ). There are some non-native plant species in or around the restoration areas that are not known to be extremely invasive, that are still localized, but are spreading outwards. Since they still are localized it may be best to eradicate them early on, before they become bigger problems. Plants in this category include golden pothos ( This species was not seen on this survey, but it is known to occur in the Waike`eke`e Drainage just to the south of the southern restoration area.). Tropical kudzu ( Pueraria phaseoloides ) was only recently documented as being naturalized in Hawai`i, so its potential to become a serious weed threat in Hawai`i is unknown. It was collected in 2009 along the main dirt road into Waikne Valley not far from the where the road branches off from the paved road (Alex Lau, personal communication, May 17, 2012). A sterile plant of what appears to be tropical kudzu was found during this survey in one of the cacao farming areas. Alternatively, the sterile plant could be a plant of kudzu ( Pueraria montana var. lobata ), which in Hawai`i seems to persist from cultivation, but has not become truly naturalized (Alex Lau, personal communication, May 17, 2012). The identity of the plant should be confirmed when the plant is flowering and fruiting, or if it is just a single plant, it might be best to simply destroy it instead of waiting for a confirmation of its specific identity. Hau ( Hibiscus tiliaceus ) is a plant that forms thick patches in the gulch bottoms that smother native plant species. It is currently unknown whether the species is a Polynesian introduction or a plant native to Hawai`i. However, whether it is native or not, the species should be treated as a plant that is not compatible with the goal of maintaining and increasing the native plant diversity of the restoration areas, and the existing patches of it within the restoration areas should be gradually eliminated.

The proposed project consists of two components 1) forest restoration and Oahu Elepaio ( Chasiempis ibidis ) protection on approximately 270 acres in the mauka part of the valley, and 2) a cacao farm on approximately 40 acres in the makai part of the valley (Figure 1). Species of particular interest included the Oahu Elepaio, the Hawaiian hoary bat Achatinella decipiens , all of which are listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act and by the State of Hawaii. This report consists of two parts, one for the forest restoration areas and the other for the cacao farm areas. Methods Surveys for the Oahu Elepaio and other bird species were conducted in the cacao farm areas on 20 March 2012. Surveys consisted of walking through the proposed project areas and looking and listening for birds. Playbacks of recorded Oahu Elepaio songs were broadcast at approximately 100-meter intervals in an attempt to elicit a response. Elepaio defend territories year-round and song playbacks are an efficient method of locating elepaio and determining the extent of their territory (VanderWerf 2004). Elepaio often respond more strongly to local song dialects (VanderWerf 2007), so recordings used during playbacks were from Waikane Valley. After each playback observers listened and watched for elepaio for several minutes. Most elepaio respond to recorded songs within one minute (VanderWerf 2007), but some approach quietly and must be searched for visually. Surveys for the Hawaiian hoary bat were conducted using an SM2BAT+ bat detector (Wildlife Acoustics Inc., Concord, MA), which records their ultrasonic echolocation calls. The bat detector was deployed from 20 to 26 March, or 6 nights, and was programmed to record from sunset to sunrise each day. It was located on top of a small ridge in the middle of the 5.1 acre section of southern cacao area, near an un-named Stream (Figure 2) , and was mounted on a tree 2.0 meters above the ground (Figure 3). The nearby stream provided an open flight corridor tha t bats might use while foraging. Results A total of 17 bird species was observed in the cacao farm areas of Waikane Valley (Table 1). Only one native bird species was observed, a single Kolea or Pacific Golden Plover ( Pluvialis fulva ) that was foraging on a grassy lawn. The other 16 bird species observed were non-native (Table 1). No Oahu Elepaio or other native forest birds were observed. No Hawaiian hoary bat calls were recorded by the bat detector on any of the six nights surveyed. The bat detector made a total of 246 recordings that spanned all nights it was deployed, demonstrating that it was functioning properly, but all of recordings were of noise, such as wind or squeaking branches, and not bat calls. Discussion and Recommendations The absence of Oahu Elepaio in the proposed cacao farm areas is not surprising. The habitat in the cacao farm areas is generally not suitable for Oahu Elepaio because it consists primarily of open ground, agricultural plantings, and low shrubby vegetation, which elepaio Zweng Faunal Surveys (Cacao Farm Area) C-2generally avoid (VanderWerf et al. 2001). There is some forest on the edges and along nearby streams, but it is dominated by alien tree species not favored by elepaio, such as Albizia and Ardesia . The proposed cacao farm areas are outside the critical habitat for the Oahu Elepaio and are fairly distant (>1.5 kilometers) from the nearest known Oahu Elepaio territories (Figure 2)and currently are of no value to the Oahu Elepaio. Modification of the existing vegetation in the proposed cacao farm areas thus would have no impact on the Oahu Elepaio or its habitat. Little is known about the distribution or abundance of the Hawaiian hoary bat on Oahu. The Hawaiian hoary bat roosts in trees at night, usually by itself, but it may use a variety of tree species. Modification of the existing vegetation in the proposed cacao farm areas would not be expected have any impact on the Hawaiian hoary bat because it is not known to occur in the area. Table 1.

Ross Assistant Professor, Botany Kapi'olani Community College December 2020 Zweng DEA Appendices Page 20 of 317INTRODUCTION This report summarizes the results of a botanical survey conducted on a n approximately 3.5- acre plot of land in Waikne Valley, Oahu, Hawaii. Waikne Valley is situated on the windward side of Oahu in the ahupua a of Waikne . Conditions are generally mesic to wet, with moderate to heavy winter rainfall. The terrain is quite rugged towards the back of the valley near the steep slopes of the Ko'olau mountains. T he topography i s gently sloped in most other areas of the valley, maki ng it an ideal location for agriculture. It is therefore no surprise to find numerous agricultural plantings along the roadside and in the adjacent area s. The property is located approximately 1.2 miles west of Kamehameha Highway along Waiahole Valley Road and is part of a larger property owned by the `hulehule Forest Conservancy . Although nearby areas on the `hulehule Forest Conservancy property have been surveyed in the past, this particular location was not included in those survey s. Since the land plot has been proposed as a site for a single home development , documenting the vegetation was a priority in this study . The primary objectives of this study were to: 1.Conduct a baseline survey of the vegetation at the site. 2.Provide a description of the vegetation. 3.Prepare a check list of the vascular plant taxa observed . SURVEY METHODS The property was surveyed on foot on December 6, 2020. An effort was made to survey all possible locations. Most plant taxa were identified on site, and for those that required magnification or otherwise could not be identified in the feild, collections were made and identified later . Voucher specimens were not collected. RESULTS & DISCUSSION VEGETATION The vegetation in the survey area consists largely of invasive non -native species . The upper canopy layer is dominated by a fairly young and open stand of Albizia ( Falcataria mollucana) , approximately 20 -30ft. in height, non- native trees, such Fiddlewood (Citharexylum Mangifera indica) occuring in smaller stands. In the understory, and especially in openings in the canopy, a thick, nearly impentrable feild of are also quite common in the understory . In shadier areas, invasive vines, such Zweng found climb ing the taller grasses and smothering the lower branches of the trees. The only native species encoun tered on the property were the indica). The fern is one of the most common indigenous ferns in the Hawaiian Islands , occurring in mesic to wet areas on all the major islands (Palmer 2003). Cyperus polystachyos, an annual sedge, and the indigenous subshrub Uhaloa, are both quite common in disturbed, grassy areas (Wagner et al. 1990) . These species are restricted to the northeast portion of the property. No endemic taxa were observed during the survey. The Polynesian introduced Ti (Cordyline fruticosa ) also appears to be naturalized in the same area as the native species mentioned above . This particular location is more open and disturbed compared to other areas at the site . In the past it operated as a chicken farm , which likely explains the localized erosion (Pers. Comm., current owner). A diverse assemblage of non - native herbs and grasses favor this disturbed spot . These , including the Bamboo orchid ( Arundina graminifolia) and the Philippine ground orchid (Spathoglottis plicata). the western boundary of the property , near Waiahole Valley Road , there are various landscape plantings consisting of mostly ornamental species that have persisted in the area, but do not appear to be naturalizing . These include various palms, such as the Chinese (Livistona ( Roystonea regia) , the latter appears to be spreading on its own. There is a non - native sword fern ( Nephrolepis brownii) that grows as an epiphyte on many of the palm trees. There are also some bromeliads , dumb cane (Dieffenbachia sp.), and a single Cardboard palm (Zamia furfuracea) growing in the understory of the palms . A small stand of Polynesian bamboo (Schizostachyum glaucifolium s everal P ua kenikeni ( Fagraea berteroan) trees can be found scattered in the same area, along with a single variegated Hala ( Pandanus tectorius) . In addition, such as Avocado ( Persea americana) , a few different species H. caribaea, H. metallica, and H. psittacorum ), Gingers, including White ginger ( Hedychium coronarium ) and the Polynesian introduced Shampoo ginger (Zingiber zerumbet ), grow in this area. The single C ook pine ( Araucaria columnaris) found near the entrance of the property appears to have been planted. Zweng DEA Appendices Page 22 of 317REFERENCES Palmer, D.D. 2003 .

T he arrangement is alphabetical by family and then genus within each major taxonomic group ing. All native and naturalized flowering plant taxa listed in this report follow the taxonomic treatments of the Manual of the Flowering Plants of Hawaii (Wagner et al. 199 0). To reflect the most current taxonomy, the online Flora of the Hawaiian Islands website (Wagner et al. 2005, 2012) was used to update names . Flowering plant families used in this report follow the classification of the Angiosperm Phyl ogeny Group IV (2017). For ornamental plants ( e.g., those persisting from plantings, but not naturalizing), taxonomic treatments follow A Tropical Garden Flora: Plants Cultivated in the Hawaiian Islands and other Tropical Places (Staples & Herbst 2005). Al though o rnamental plants were not included in the checklist, there is a discussion of these plants observed during the survey in the last paragraph of the vegetation section of this report. For native and naturalized ferns, Hawaii's Ferns and Fern Allies ( Palmer 2008) and Taxonomic and Nomenclatural Updates to the Fern and Lycophyte Flora of the Hawaiian Islands (Ranker et al. 2019) were referenced .

(CSH) is requesting a historic preservation review of the proposed hulehule Forest Conservancy Pro posed Cacao Farm Project. Based on a review of previous archaeological investigati ons and a recently conducted pedestrian inspection of the entire project area CSH feels th at an effect determination of \"no historic properties affected\" is warranted for the proposed project, and thus seeks SHPD's concurrenc e. A description of the proposed project as well as a summary of previous archaeology and the recent ly conducted fieldwork is provided below. The proposed project comprises approxima tely 49 acres of land located at Waik ne, on the windward side of O'ahu. The entire acreage is di vided into four discrete areas (hereafter referred to as NPA, SPA 1, SPA 2 and SPA 3). The northernmost portion (NPA) is acc essible on Waik ne Valley Road; and the three southern portions (SPA 1, SPA 2 a nd SPA 3) are accessible on Waiahole Valley Road (Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3). All areas of the proposed project are accessible on paved roads; how ever, within the project areas, road conditions are poor and re quire 4-wheel drive to traverse. Th e proposed project includes plans to develop these areas by preparing the land for plan ting multiple shaded orchards with organic cacao varieties, constructing buildings re lated to cacao processing, creating a base yard for storing and staging farm equipment, and a single residence fo r the caretaker/proprietor of the farm.

Previous Archaeological Research Previous archaeological investigat ions in and around the project area are summarized in Table 1 and depicted on Figure 4 and Figure 5. In 1988, Paul H. Rosendahl, Ph.D., Inc. (PHRI) conducted an archaeological reconnaissance survey with limited subsurface test ing in support of the Waik ne Golf Course Project (Shapiro et al. 1988). The approximately 300-acre survey area abuts the makai (eastern) edge of the current project area (see Figure 4). Shapiro et al. (1988) identif ied 29 sites (consisting of 60 co mponent features), including the previously-identified Kukuianiani Heiau site. The site s included agricultural, boundary, tool manufacture, habitation, transportation, and religious si tes for cemeteries, burials, shrines, and heiau . All of the religious sites were identified well outside the current project area; mo st are clustered within 300 m of Kamehameha Highway. In 1992, PHRI conducted an archaeological inventory survey with subs urface testing in support of two proposed golf course projects (Dunn et al. 1992). The approximately 407-acre survey area, which comprises the entire project area, is depicted in Figure 4. Dunn et al. ( 1992) identified 13 sites (consisting of 100 component features). It is noteworthy that all iden tified sites were found within perennial or ephemeral stream drainages, and not within the current project area, which is situated entirely atop ridges that have been impacted by agriculture and military ac tivities. Most of the features were interpreted as pre-Contact agricultural feat ures; nine were related to historic ch arcoal production; thre e were related to temporary habitation; and one was interpreted as ceremonial. SIHP #50-80-10-4356 appears to have been a major pre-Contact/post-Contact agricultural complex with 46 identified features. Eight C-14 dates were reported; the oldest was calibrated to A.D. 1400-1640. The abovementioned Dunn et al. (1992) study wa s reviewed and accepted by the SHPD/DLNR on February 5, 1993 (Log. No. 7438; Doc. No. 9302TD08: see Appendix A). In 2008, International Archaeological Research Inst itute, Inc., (IARII) conduc ted an archaeological survey and monitoring at the former Waikane Training Area in anticipation of ordnance assessment and removal operations (Rasmussen 2008). The IARII st udy area encompassed the northern portion of the current project area (see Figure 4) . 10 historic properties were docum ented and included archaeological sites associated with pre-Contact traditional Ha waiian taro cultivation and post-Contact charcoal manufacturing. Probable habitation areas were observed on higher ground near lo'i (irrigated terraces), suggesting the farmers lived near their fields. The lo'i and associated features were observed along alluvial flats adjacent to streams. Metal tools found within some of th e fields indicate the fields were being farmed into the 19th and earl y 20th century. No historic propertie s were observed within the current project area.

Results of Fieldwork The project area is characterized by low ridge tops with level to gently sloping topography bounded by steep slopes and gulches. The project area is divided into four areas: the Northern Project Area (NPA), which is 20.91 acres; Southern Project Area 1 (SPA 1), 8.86 acres; Southern Project Area 2 (SPA 2), 16.22 acres; and Southern Project Area 3 (SPA 3), 3.2 acres (see Figure 1 and Figure 2). The pedestrian inspection consiste d of a 100% ground survey of the pr oject area. A graphic depiction of CSH's survey coverage is provided in Figure 6 and Figure 7. The ground su rvey of the pr oject area was accomplished through systematic sweeps where applic able. The interval between archaeologists was typically between 5 m to 10 m. In general, surface visibility was fair to poor due to dense vegetation that obscured the ground surface. The areas surveyed are lightly to de nsely vegetated; grasses. The entire project area consists of small ridges and tablelands that have been impacted by prior land alterations related to agricultural, military and illegal dumping. Ab andoned cars and other large items were dumped within the project area. The Southern Project Area 1 (SPA 1) was approximat ely 9 acres. The vegetation at SPA 1 was sparse to very thick. The sparse, clear ar eas exhibited evidence of prior di sturbance related to clearing and cutting access roads. No historic properties were observed during survey of SPA 1. The Southern Project Area 2 (SPA 2) was approximately 16 acres. This portion of the project area was the most developed. Observed land modifications included residential structures and mass grading associated with road construction, agriculture and chicken farming (Figure 8, Figure 9, and Figure 10). No historic properties were observed during survey of SPA 2. The Southern Project Area 3 (SPA 3) was approxim ately 3 acres, and consisted of an open field with a manicured lawn and an adjacent abandoned dirt road (Figure 11 and Figure 12). No historic properties were observed during survey of SPA 3. The Northern Project Area (NPA) was approximately 21 acres. Extensive clearing and modification had taken place in the NPA due to cutting for roadwa ys and past land use as a military training area (Figure 13). In contrast to SPA 1, 2 and 3, the NPA exhibited substantial disturbance due to military training activities and more recent ordnance detection and disposal efforts. The NPA exhibited numerous pit excavations related to these de tection and disposal events, some measuring as deep as 60 cmbs (centimeters below surface) and over a meter in diameter. \"Much of the project area has been affected by alluvial and colluvial erosion\" (Dunn et al 1992: 7). No historic proper ties were observed during survey of the NPA.

In conclusion, no historic propert ies were observed during a 100% pe destrian survey of the entire project area. The extensive land modifications observe d within this entire project area would have destroyed and completely removed any surface hist oric properties that may have been present. Additionally agricultural (i.e ., grading and plowing) a nd military (i.e., traini ng and ordinance clearance) activities noted within the project area likely have destroyed and completely removed and subsurface cultural deposits that may have been present. Conclusion No historic properties were identified within the project area during previous archaeological investigations (Dunn et al. 1992 and Rasmussen 2008) and during a r ecent pedestrian inspection by CSH. The Dunn et al. (1992) study which encompassed the entire current project area was reviewed and accepted by SHPD/DLNR on February 5, 1993 (Log. No. 7438; Doc. No. 9302TD08: Appendix A). Additionally, the recent survey of the project area by CSH indicated that the project area has been subjected to extensive land modifications associated with agricultural and military activities. These observed disturbances have likely destroyed and/or completely removed any surface and/or subsurface historic properties that may have been present within the project area. Based on thes e findings CSH seeks SHPD concurrence that an effect de termination of \"no historic properties affected\" is warranted for the proposed project, and that no additional archaeological investigation and/or mitigat ion is necessary for the project to proceed. We appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to receiving your response. Sincerely, Hallett H. Hammatt President Cultural Surveys Hawaii, Inc. P. O.

Land Jurisdiction Private , hulehule Forest Conservancy , LLC Agencies SHPD/DLNR Project Description The proposed project consists of the restoration and reuse of ancient loi along the Waikne and Waikeekee Streams for kalo farming. Project Acreage Approximately 10 acres. Area of Potential Effect (APE) For the purposes of this preservation plan, the APE is defined as the entire approximately 10 -acre project area. Background to the Plan The land on which the current project area rests was part of the Former Waikane Valley Training Area (FWVTA). This site is a Formerly Used Defense Site (FUDS) and has undergone the proces s of demilitarization. This entire training area was \"used by the Army and marine Corps for training from 1942 to 1976\" (US Army Corps of Engineers 2011). In 2008, International Archaeological Research Institute, Inc., (IARII) conducted an archaeologica l survey and monitoring at the FWVTA in anticipation of ordnance assessment and removal operations (Rasmussen 2008). The IARII study area (approximately 900 -acres) completely encompasses the current project area and thoroughly documented the two sites addres sed in this plan. After the ordnance clearance was completed, large portions of the FWVTA were purchased by hulehule Forest Conservancy, LLC and a number of revitalization projects were planned: planting of native species in three separate forest restoration areas; an organic cacao farm in the lowlands; and the restoration and reuse of taro loi along Waikne and Waikeekee Streams, addressed here.

These sites are identified a s the Waikn e Taro Flats (SIHP TMKs [1] 4 -8-014:005 and 4-8 -006:001along the Waikne and Waikeekee Streams between 41 and 89 meters (134 - 292 ft.) AMSL. This area is depicted on the U.S. Geological Survey 7.5-minute series topographic map, Kahana (1992) and Kaneohe (1998) Quadrangles, tax map and aerial photograph (Figure 1 to Figure 3 ). The project area is located on land privately owned by hulehule Forest Conservancy, LLC. The proposed project consists of the restoration and reuse of ancient and historic loi along the Waikne and Waikeekee Streams for kalo farming. 1.1 Project Background The land on which the current project area rests was part of the Former Waikne Valley Training Area (WVTA). This site is a Formerly Used Defense Site (FUDS) and has undergone the process of demilitarization. This entire training area was \"used by the Army and marine Corps for training from 1942 to 1976\" (U S Army Corps of Engineers 2011). In 2008, International Archaeological Research Institute, Inc., (IARII) conducted an archaeological survey and monitoring at the FWVTA in anticipation of ordnance assessment and removal operations (Rasmussen 2008). The IARII study area (approximately 900-acre s) completely encompasses the current project area and thoroughly documented ten historic properties, including the two sites addressed in this plan. After the ordnance clearance was completed, large portions of the FWV TA were purchased by hulehule Forest Conservancy, LLC and a number of revitalization projects were planned: planting of native species in three separate forest restoration areas; an organic cacao farm in the lowlands; and the restoration and reuse of tar o loi along Waikne and Waikeekee ( Waikne Taro Flats) was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The site consists of seven terrace sets; associated agricultural features such as 'auwai; possible habitation features; and religious features including an agricultural shrine and a birthing stone. SIHP #: 50-80 -10-4356 (Waikeekee Loi) consists of five terrace sets and other agricultural features; a number of charcoal kilns and a boulder with historic petroglyphs. Prepared in consultation with SHPD/DLNR and hulehule Forest Conservancy , LLC, this preservation plan is designed to fulfill the State requirements for preservation plans per HAR 13- 277-3. This document was prepared to su pport the proposed project's historic preservation review under Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 6E -42 and HAR Chapter 13-284.

The Waikne and Waikeekee Streams wind through the Project areas. Waihole Ahupua'a is just south of Waik ne. The ahupuaa and Kahana border northern Ahupua'a, and Waipi'o Ahupua'a is to its west. Kne'ohe Bay is to the east. Like all of the windward valleys, Waikne is affected by the prevailing winds in the island, which are the northeas t trades that blow against the Ko'olau Mountains (Juvik and Juvik 1998: 55). The Project area is located on the wetter windward coast of O'ahu with annual rainfall averaging 80 inches (Giambelluca et al. 1986). Soils within the Project area are primarily Waikne Silty Clay, twenty -five to forty percent slopes (WpE ) with a smaller percentage of Waikne Silty Clay, forty to seventy percent slopes (WpF) (Figure 4 ). The Waikne series consist of very deep well drained soils that formed in material weathered in alluvium and colluvium from basic igneous rock. Waikne soils are on fans and terraces and have slopes of three to seventy percent (Foote et al. 1972). Topography varies with proximity to the streams, growing steeper toward to outer edges of the sites with level terraced areas making up the majority of the site areas.

There is a dirt jeep road which passes just north of the Waikeekee project area and through the center of the Waikne project area. The jeep road will be used to access the project areas and there are plans to improve/realign this road; the realignment will be dealt with in a separate document.

The district of Ko'olaupoko was rich in many of the resources utilized by traditional Hawaiians. Inland from the coast, rich alluvial soils, an equable climate and abundant water supply allowed the extensive cultivation of traditional crops, especially wetland taro. Handy and Handy characterized the ahupua'a in the region as being extremely productive and capable of accommodating a significant population. The coastal plains were converted \"into an almost continuous expanse of loi (irrigated terraces) irrigated with water from large streams flowing out of the deep valleys\" along the Ko'olau range. This intense food production could support a considerable population. (Handy and Handy 1972:452) This sentiment was reiterated by early visitors to the region. The valleys were described as being \"in a high state of cultivation\" w ith evidence of prehistoric loi and 'auwai (ditch) found throughout the valley floors ( Figure 5 ). The upland forests and ridges that divide the valleys undoubtedly contained a wide variety of valuable resources as well, one of which is known to have been high-quality basalt that was quarried and used in the manufacture of stone tools. Archaeological sites identified within Waikne re flect many of the traditional activities associated with the utilization of these resources, including agriculture, habitation, tool manufacture, and religious observance. Loi kalo have been identified along the stream beds from the upper reaches of the valleys to where the streams meet the sea. 2.2 Mo'olelo of Waikne According to Pukui et al. the name Waikne was Wai -a-Kane and is literally translated as \"Kne's water\" (1974:223). It was here that Kne first dug for water for the benefit of Paliuli. Paliuli literally translates as \"green cliff\" and is the equivalent of the Garden of Eden. Below Paliuli are the famous waters of Waiololi and Waiolola ( Hoku o Hawaii , January 12, 1926). There are many traditions connected with this ahupua'a including references t o the Hawaiian Akua (God) Kne and Hi'iaka, the Hawaiian demi -god well as the Kumulipo (Hawaiian origins chant). Hi'iaka mentions these traditions as she journeys past Waikne on her way to Kaua'i. Waikne was also the home of Laka, the chief that was born at 'Alae in Kpahulu (Maui). Laka ruled at Ko'olaupoko, O'ahu, and house was at Hale'ula in Waikne (Henriques-Peabody HEN [n.d.]: Vol. 1, p. 985).

CSH Photo of Terrace wall in Waikne Valley 2.2.1 Kumuli po The famous waters Waiololi and Waiolola are a common refrain in the Kumulipo (Hawaiian origins chant). \"O Kane ia Wai'ololi, o ka wahine ia Wai'olola\" speaks of Waiololi and Waiolola, generally thought to symbolize the male and female procreative forces respectively. Martha Beckwith explains: The words Wai'ololi and Wai'olola are applied in everyday speech to a narrow entrance through which water passes with force and a wide one which receives them without a struggle. Thus Pokini says the first term is given to a narrow bay along the coast where the water carries the fish in with a rush, the second to a large shoreline where the surf rolls in without breaking. (Beckwith 1970:51) This tradition also appears in another early twentieth century Hawaiian language newspaper as follows: Zweng DEA Appendices Page 61 of 317Cultural Surveys Hawai'i Job Code: WAIKANE 5 Introduction Preservation Plan for the Reuse of Taro Loi along Waikne and Waikeekee Streams, on the property of the hulehule Forest Conservancy, Waikn e Ahupuaa, Koolaupoko District, O'ahu and -8-006:001 At Waikane, Koolaupoko, is a land called Pali-uli. Also there in Waikane are two streams that surround this land of Paliuli, for both streams have the same source. In Waikane also are the names Waiolola and Waiololi, mentioned in the Kumulipo Chant. ( Hawai'i Holomua, March 20, 1912) Whether the Kumulipo actually refers to specific sites in Waikne Valley is less than clear although it does seem clear that certain sources have interpreted it this way since at least as early as 1912 and shows the importance of Waikne in relation to Hawaiian world views . This cosmogonic, genealogical prayer chant, which is over two thousand lines in length, was used to trace the divine origins of ali 'i through ruling chiefs, deified ancestors, and gods backwards in time through the animals, plants, and elements to the beginning of the universe. The Kumulipo is one of a class of such cosmological chants, but no others of such length are preserved (Silva 2004:103). This chant, titled He Pule Ho 'ola'a Ali prayer to consecrate [an] 'i) (Silva 2004:98), was composed for the Hawai 'i Island ali 'i Ka ''mamao, also known as Lonoikamakahiki, when several kapu (sacred) rituals were performed that elevated him to the status of a god (Beckwith 1970:311), or divine king, in approximately A.D. 1600 (Kirch 2010:83). The text of the Kumulipo was first recorded by David Kalkaua in 1889 and translated by Queen Lili 'uokalani in 1897, which was not available when folklorist Martha Beckwith completed her own translation and detailed study (1951). Starting from, \"O ke kumu o ka lipo \" (At the beginning of the deep da rkness), the Kumulipo divides the genesis of the world into 16 w (epochs, time periods) (Beckwith 1951). These 16 w are categorized into two periods, p (darkness, the realm of the gods) and ao (light). During the first period of p there was a continuou s birthing of the lower life forms to sea life, plants, and eventually mammals. During the second period of ao came the opening of light and the appearance of the first woman and man, La 'ila'i and Ki 'i, respectively, and the coming of the gods, including K ne and Kanaloa, which resulted in over a thousand genealogical pairs (Beckwith 1970: 310 -11). Significantly, Hawaiian identity today is derived from origin genealogies such as the Kumulipo: \"...every aspect of the Hawaiian conception of the world is related by birth, and as such, all parts of the Hawaiian world are one indivisible lineage\" (Kame ( Figure 6 ) is mentioned in the accounts of the travels of the goddess Hi'iaka up the Ko'olau Coast on her way to bring back her sister Pele's lover Lohiau. In this section of the mo'olelo, Hi'iaka has just departed from He'eia Kea after offering a remedy to a husband and wife to cure the husband of his illness. As they passed the 'ina (land) of Waikne she commented to her traveling companions about the sacred waters of the area. ... i ko lkou hele ana a h'ea i... hou mai la i kana inoa o keia 'ina no ka mea, i anei i 'auwaha wai mua ai o Kne i na wai e pono ai o Paliuli, He Paliuli no ko'onei, aia la i kela kaola Pali e waiho mai la, a malalo mau wahi kaulana a Waiolola 62 of 317Cultural Surveys Hawai'i Job Code: WAIKANE 5 Introduction Preservation Plan for the Reuse of Taro Loi along Waikne and Waikeekee Streams, on the property of the hulehule Forest Conservancy, Waikn e Ahupuaa, Koolaupoko District, a ola lala ka. 'ina.\" (Ka Na'i Aupuni, January 26, 1906) Here Hi'iaka turned and spoke again to her friend: \"The name of this land is Waikne because it was here that Kne first channeled the water need for the land of Paliuli. This place has a Paliuli as well, there on that ridge of cliffs and just below. There are renowned waters here, Wai'olol and Wai'olol. One is male and the other female. Wai'olil is the male and Wai'olol, the female. This is a fine land, a place of abundance but the land shall come depleted and withered.\" (Hooulumahiehie, 150) From Waikne, Hi'iaka and her companions to Hakipu'u and Kualoa. 1.1.1.1 Hi'iaka and Mokoli'i According to M.J. Kapihenui's 1862 version published in Hawaiian in Ka Hk o ka Pkpika . As they approached Kualoa, the reared himself up and, pluming and vaunting himself, sought to terrify them and prevent their passa ge. Hi'iaka did not flinch in her attack. When she had killed the monster, she set up his flukes as a landmark which now forms the rock known to this day as Moko- li'i. The body of the dragon she disposed in such a way that it helped form the roadbed of the traveled highway. After the achievement she vented her feelings in an exultant song (Kapihenui's text is quoted and . lua Hi'iakaikapoliopele i Wahine'ma'o, aia ke alanui o kua l ma uka o Kaikolu, he hula 'ana 'o kai.

When you consider the deed of Hi'iakaikapoliopele, [and] the tail of that mo'o rising above Mokoli'i, h ow those two fought with Mokoli'i until Mokoli'i was killed by her and she cut off its tail and set it there. It is that heap standing there in the sea to this day. It is there in the middle of the sea of Kualoa; that heap called by his name, Mokoli'i. His body clings to the uplands becoming the seaward land and the road, that is indeed the body of that mo'o. Then, Hi'iakaikapoliopele sang this chant and wailed to Knehoalani this verse as follows: Majestic is Knehoalani Mokoli'i swims in the sea As a child, as a first- born child of Ko'olau Ko'olau is laden with numerous misfortunes/evils* (DS: The tip of the tongue of Ko'olau commands a great misfortune) A great evil or wickedness They went on as they had slain Mokoli'i whose body had become the path they trod and they passed Ka'a'awa . . . [*'ino: a poetic term for misfortunes, evil, chaos, storms, wildness, etc.] The verbatim Hawaiian language account in Ka H k o ka Pkpika (Februari 13, 1862) quoted above is given in the handwritten Pele and Hi'iaka Manuscript (n.d). of the Henriques Collection (Bishop Museum). Kep Maly tells a similar version of the story of Hi'iaka fighting with supernatural powers \u2014 her magic skirt or p', which he relates came from Tt Kawelo and other Hawaiian informants: The people of Waikne warned Hi'iaka that this mo'o, called Mokoli'i killed and ate people. Hi'iaka told them not to be afraid and that she could take care of herself. So the people followed her into Hakipu'u valley. They listened. They heard a chant and then they waited and they could hear a fight. They saw the mo'o get ready to jump at Hi'iaka and as it jumped at her she hit it with her p' . . . Hi'iaka's p' wa s kupua also. Through the power of Pele and her family and the power of the volcanoes Hi'iaka fought with the mo'o and destroyed it. She cut off its tail and threw it in the ocean where it was turned to stone and it remains there to this day for people to see that the mo'o had been killed. This piece of tail turned to stone is Mokoli'i Island. It is called Ka huelo'o'opa i koe o ka mo'o nui , the stubby remains of the lizard's tail. Other pieces of his body were thrown up into the mountain area, the plains o f 'pua and into Palik. In a small cove in the island, Mokoli'i, there is a deep cut in the stone which is said to be one of the places Hi'iaka hit the mo'o with her Zweng DEA Appendices Page 64 of 317Cultural Surveys Hawai'i Job Code: WAIKANE 5 Introduction Preservation Plan for the Reuse of Taro Loi along Waikne and Waikeekee Streams, on the property of the hulehule Forest Conservancy, Waikn e Ahupuaa, Koolaupoko District, TMK: (1) 4-8-014:005 and 4 -8-006:001 p' as she was fighting him. You can still see the outline in the stone which looks like the scales of the mo'o .

This series of mountains and cliff sections run all the way to Wai'anae. And here is the place where Mokoli'i Island stands there in the sea. So, I will offer a chant in honor of them: Chant Sixty-o ne in the Story of Hi'iaka Majestic is Knehoalani Mokoli'i swims in the sea As a child, as a first- born child of Ko'olau Numerous are the sands of Kne, Numerous are the fishing grounds Numerous are the sea capes of Ko'olau Ko'olau has become laden by sto rms.* Zweng DEA Page 65 of 317Cultural Surveys Hawai'i Job Code: WAIKANE 5 Introduction Preservation Plan for the Reuse of Taro Loi along Waikne and Waikeekee Streams, on the property of the hulehule Forest Conservancy, Waikn e Ahupuaa, Koolaupoko District, O'ahu TMK: (1) 4-8-014:005 and 4 -8-006:001 When Hi'iaka was finished chanting, they continued on until they reached the point where the boundary marks the division of Ko'olau Poko and Ko'olau Loa, at which time, Hi'iaka turned and said to her friend: Thus, we have patiently traveled over land and sea and arrived here. Here we are at ''io Point. Let us go away from this place. On the mountain side here is the kula land and, indeed, the Kumaluma'i Sea is seaward, the place about which it is said, 'Sleep peacefully in the sea of your lord.' When Hi'iaka finished chanting, then they continued on until they presently arrived at the point which divides Ko'olau Poko and Ko'olau Loa and, at which time, Hi'iaka turned once more and spoke again to her companion, Wahine'ma'o, these words . . . . . . Her e we are at the point of ''io. Let us go away from this place. There is a kula mountainward, [and] also the Lumaluma'i Sea in the ocean and it is the same sea of which it is said, 'Sleep peacefully in the sea of your lord.' All accounts discussed above (Kapihenui 1862, Henriques Collection n.d and Ho'oulumhiehie 1906) offer versions of the kau (sacred chant) chanted by Hi'iaka at Kualoa. In all cases the first three lines are essentially the same and relatively easily translated. The subsequent two or three lines notably differ among the Kapihenui grouping and the later Ho'oulumhiehie newspaper accounts. Kep Maly shares a different version of the story that was told by Keapo'okalani, an old Hawaiian woman. . . . the mo'o became so ashamed of being wounded so terribly by this young girl [Hi'iaka], whom he didn't recognize as a member of the Pele family, that he put his head into the ocean in shame. As he put his head in the water, his tail came up and that is when Hi'iaka cut it off.

Ms. Parish identifies the sacred lands of O'ahu as the ahupua'a of Kualoa, Hakipu'u, Waikne, Waihole and 'pua and writes they have been declared sacred by the gods K, Kne, Lono and Kanaloa. She writes: The sacredness of these lands was confirmed by the ancient ali'i Kamapua'a, the demi-god, who declared that all lands whose name contain the word wai were to be held sacred and become the property of the priesthood. It was found that his precept was not very practical for the ali'i and their people simply because so many land names contained wai that very few good land areas were actually available to the royalty and their people. The precept was modified. (cited in Shideler 2007:167) 2.3 Place Names and Wahi Pana Hawaiian place names convey a wide variety of information about the relationships among people, landscapes and other natural and cultural resources. Place names may also express cultural, historical and/or spiritual values and concepts important to Hawaiian world views. It is common for places and landscape features to have multiple names, some of which may only be known to certain 'ohana (families) or even certain individuals within 'ohana, and many of which have been lost, forgotten or kept secret through time. Place names may also convey kaona (hidden meanings) and huna (secret) information that may even have political or subversive undertones. Before the introduction of writing to the islands, when cultural information was exclusively preserved and perpetuated orally, Hawaiians gave names to literally everything in their environment , including individual garden plots and 'auwai, house sites, intangible phenomena such as meteorological and atmospheric effects, phaku, pnwai, and many others. A Hawaiian wahi pana, also referred to as a place name, \"physically and poetically describes an area while revealing its historical or legendary significance\" (Landgraf 1994:v). Wahi pana can refer to natural geographic locations, such as streams, peaks, rock formations, ridges, and offshore islands and reefs, or they can refer to Hawaiian divisi ons, such as ahupua'a and 'ili (land section, next in importance to an ahupua'a and usually a subdivision of an ahupua'a), and man-made structures, such as fishponds. Wahi pana may also express cultural, historical and/or spiritual values and concepts important to Hawaiian world views. All wahi pana meanings are cited from Pukui et al. (1974) unless otherwise noted.

McAllister lists two heiau in the the foot of Puu Pueo,Waikane. A small two- terrace structure covered with haole-koa and lantana. The slope on the mountain- side is steep and was probably cut into, in locating the upper terrace, and the dirt removed used in building the face of this terrace. The most interesting feature is the large stone at the base of the lower terrace. The two artificial cavities in the surface of the stone appear to have been used as mortars for the pounding or grinding of some substance. Site 318. Kaawakoa heiau , on an elevation a few hundred feet south of Kukuianiani (Site 317), which Thrum said was a companion structure.

The courses were usually started on a steep incline, such as a hill then extended into a lower plain area. (Malo 1951: 294) The resting site for the Kapahu Hlua is said to be where Lincoln McCandless' house now stands. The hlua started on the hill b ehind the Catholic Church. This hlua sled was very famous , for here, the prominent people as well as the ordinary folk came to sled ( Ke Aloha 'ina 1919). i Waikne pule o ke aupuni lani, makai o ke alanui.

Arriving at Waikne there stands the church of the heavenly kingdom seaward of the road. There are many beautiful houses and the land lying before your gaze is lovely. In this place is the vacation home of Lincoln McCandless (called \"Elele Linekona Eliwai\" \"Lincoln Water -Digger Envoy\" in reference to his fame as an advocate of artesian well digging) the very hospitable friend of those skilled in politics of the Democratic Party. There are many Hawaiians at that place, some supported by Lincoln McCandless. Turning to the uplands one sees the furrows of the valleys in the mountain. There is the watercourse of Waihole excavated into the mountain emerging at Waipi'o to supply water to the sugar growing consortiums of Waipahu. Where Lincoln McCandless' house now stands was the resting place for the hlua sledders. It was called Kapahu. The hlua started on the hill back of the Catholic Church. The hlua sled was very famous for at this place the prominent people as well as the ordinary folk came here to sled. That is why the place was called Waikne. According to Kamakau, the building of the hlua course required that it \"was covered with stalks of pili grass stripped of the blade and laid evenly. Midday was the favorite time for the sport when the heat of the sun made the grass slippery and the sled could then attain terrific speed .\" (Kamakau 1992 :243) The Kapahu Hlua site was also indicated in Sterling and Summers (1978) which state that the hlua slide was close to the mauka side of Kamehameha Highway between Waikne Stream on the south and Pu'u Pueo Ridge on the north. 2.3.3 Puuhonua Puuhonua are places of refuge where kapu-breakers or non-combatants during times of war could find culturally sanctioned asylum and safety from which they might be allowed to leave at a later time and reintegrate within society. According to Kamakau, ruling chiefs were regarded as puuhonua incarnate . Their lands ('ina pu uhonua), as well as their consorts and deities, were also regarded as sacrosanct. Ten places on O'ahu were regarded as puuhonua, six of which were in the Ko olau districts (Kamakau 1992:17 -18). S. M. Kamakau (1964:18) lists Waikne as one of three puuhonua (place of refuge) lands of Koolaupoko, O'ahu, \" O ka puuhonua o ka poe ahupua'a 'okana, o make a komo ilaila 2.3.4 Adze Quarry Adze quarries have been identified on the ridges between the valleys, and evidence of the manufacture of stone tools has been found throughout the valley floors. The quarry sites that comprise the Wai hole Quarry Complex have been recommended for inclusion in the National and State Registers. In a 1964 report, Kikuchi found considerable evidence of the manufacture of stone tools within the valley, including a lithic scatter in a bulldozed field later designated as Zweng DEA Appendices Page 75 of 317Cultural Surveys Hawai'i Job Code: WAIKANE 5 Introduction Preservation Plan for the Reuse of Taro Loi along Waikne and Waikeekee Streams, on the property of the hulehule Forest Conservancy, Waikn e Ahupuaa, Koolaupoko District, -10-2476, two adze quarries on one of the ridges along the edge of the valley (SIHP #50-80-10-2472 and -2475). 2.4 Ga thering and Cultivation 2.4.1 'ina Resources Waikne was rich in many of the resources utilized by traditional Hawaiians. Inland from the coast, rich alluvial soils, an equable climate, and abundant water supply allowed the extensive cultivation of traditional crops, especially wetland taro. Handy and Handy characterized the ahupuaa in the region as each having: ...a broad coastal plain which was converted by Hawaiians into an almost continuous expanse of loi irrigated with water from large streams flowing out of the deep valleys that cut back into the Ko olau range. The hinterland must have produced great quantities of sweet potato, yam, banana, upland taro, wauke, olon, and awa. Undoubtedly the population was large... (1972:452) A portion of Handy's (1940) description of Waikne in the 1930s mentions the current Project Area: Terraces were built on the level land up the valley along the stream. About half a mile inland, where broad flats flank a wide curve in the stream, is a beautiful plantation of about 40 terraces, all planted in taro grown from milling. Following the road toward Na Puu Koiele, small abandoned terraces are to be seen here and there along the stream. Just beyond the juncture of the two streams forming Waikane several small terrace sections were being cleared by Hawaiians in 1935. About 2 miles inland on the north side of the stream below Na Puu Koiele, is a kuleana with half a dozen terraces planted with young taro. Above this point are other small abandoned kuleana. (Handy 1940:94) Handy and Handy (1972) continued to research the traditional agricultural use of the land: ....Waikane was a major source of Koolau taro, especially in the broad area between the highway and the sea, and as much as half a mile inland there was extensive loi cultivation. (Handy and Handy 1972:442) Waikne Taro Flats represent a portion of the field system within Waikne and has been entered on the National Register of Historic Places. T. Stell Newman (1972), an archaeologist with the Division of State Parks, conducted a survey along Waikne Stream in 1970 as part of the state-wide site inventory. Two historic properties were identified: SIHP #50-80 -06-1057, a partial rectangular enclosure along the north bank of Waikne Stream approximately 1 kilometer inland from Waikne Town; and SIHP #50 -80-06-1078, a series of taro terraces in the upper reaches of Waikne Stream including fla t beds and two beds with remnants of interior mounds and numerous 'auwai. Newman recommended preserving the area as a nature park. SIHP #50 - 80-06-1078, Waikne Taro Flats with boundaries defined to include a large area beyond the known features, was nominated by Newman to the National Register of Historic Places and listed in the Register on April 11, 1973.

Fifteen generations prior to the time of Kamakau, Kiha the son of Pi'ilani paved \"paved with rocks and straightened the roads of Molokai and Maui and these roads are still preserved today.\" (Kamakau 1992: 429) There is documentation of ancient chiefs who constructed roads as far back as twenty centuries ago. Samuel M. Kamakau relates that: Ua 'lelo ia loa hana a keneturia ka hele ma ka pololei o ke alanui, ak i ke alualu ana o ke khi po'e e pepehi ia Maui, ua hele kike'eke'e (Kamakau 1869) Maui, son of Kalana, was one of the ancient chiefs of Maui who made roads twen ty centuries ago. The roads in his day were straight, and the people were accustomed to running along straight roads; so when certain persons ran after Maui to kill him he made the road go zigzag and it was called \"the zigzag road of Maui.\" (ka alanui kike'eke'e a Maui). is at Waikne and Waihole in Ko'olaupoko on Oahu... The road documented here that relates to Waikne is a called the zig -zag road of Mui and was built for defensive purposes. This trail is also referred to by Puku'i and relates a poetical saying referring to the demi- god Maui at Waihole, \" Ke ala kike'eke'e a Maui, \" which translates as the \"winding trails of Maui.\" Trails made by Maui when he was pursued by those who wished to destroy him. One trail was at Waihole, O'ahu, one at Keka'a between Lahaina at Kealakahakaha, Kahakuloa, Maui.\" (Puku'i 1983:180) This myth may account for some of the winding roads in Waihole. It might be the explanation as to why the path is in a certain location or has a certain configuration such as switch-backs. Alternatively this may be a traditional explanation associated with the stream named Wai- ke'eke'e (literally crooked water) in Waikne. Raphaelson (1929:24) relates \"There is a beautiful tale about Waihole and Waikne, a place beyond. These tw o were man and wife, it is said. They loved each other for many years, and even today their mists embrace in the upper clouds.\" 2.6 Early Historic Period Many researchers believe that the Hawaiian population reached its maximum at around the time of Western Contact, although by the 1830s, the native Hawaiian population had already been severely diminished by contact with western diseases. Diseases including influenza, measles, whooping cough and small pox devastated the population. Also, many of the native inhabitants from these outlying districts had begun moving to the newly burgeoning population centers, such as Honolulu. The 1831 to 1832 census, the first to be conducted on O'ahu, reports a Zweng DEA Appendices Page 79 of 317Cultural Surveys Hawai'i Job Code: WAIKANE 5 Introduction Preservation Plan for the Reuse of Taro Loi along Waikne and Waikeekee Streams, on the property of the hulehule Forest Conservancy, Waikn e Ahupuaa, Koolaupoko District, O'ahu Island 30 TMK: (1) 4-8-014:005 and 4 -8-006:001 total of 419 people in Waikne/Waihole Ahupua'a, consisting of 352 adults and 67 children. By the 1835- 1836 census, the totals are given individually for Waikne and Waihole Ahupua'a. At that time, Waikne had an adult population of 164 and 29 children for a total of 193. These numbers decreased in the 1849 census to 99 adults and 18 children for a total of 117 (Schmitt1973:19, 33). The rate of population decline slowed after 1849 and the population began to increase in parts of Oahu in 1853, but the population of Koolaupoko continued to decline until 1872 (Kittelson 1972, cited in Devaney et al. 1982: 13). With the steady decline in the native population, an increasing amount of land was left fallow or was converted to pasture for cattle grazing. (Devaney et al. 1982: 12) Despite the population decline, a number of individuals still resided on the lands for many years with their families. During Queen Emma's Oahu Island tour in 1875, she and her entourage visited Waikne (Girvin 1910:78). The group was feted by Kamealoha, who had \"two large thatch houses and a large school house at his command for sleeping quarters, and had erected an immense lanai for the luau. He was a well- 1910:78) \"Leis of hala fruit and others\" were provided for the event, along with \"fish prepared in many styles, both raw, dried and cooked, the hogs, poultry and delicious comestibles.\" 2.7 The Mhele : Hawaiian Land Tenure System The Mhele was a division of rights to lands that was established by Kamehameha III in 1848. Although this was a new system of land tenure in Hawai'i the foundation for these concepts are rooted in Hawaiian understandings and tra ditions of reciprocal relationships with 'ina, including kalai'ina (redistribution of land), and mlama 'ina (caring for the land). The impetus for these \"land law[s] and subsequent division (mhele) of rights in land for the people of Hawai'i\" began with the Declaration of Rights of 1839 and the subsequent Laws of 1839. (Preza, 2010: 77) The first written constitution in 1840 expounded on the principles of the land laws in Article 14 which states that; \"Kamehameha I, was the founder of the kingdom an d to him belonged all the land from one end of the Islands to the other, though it was not his own private property. It belonged to the chiefs and people in common, of whom Kamehameha I was the head, and had the management of the landed property.\" (Preza, 2010: 80) Although the ruler did not have sole ownership of the land, land was conveyed only by the consent of the ruler of the Kingdom. In order for this new system to function the Organic Acts of 1845 created the Board of Commissioners to Quiet Land Titles otherwise known as the Land Commission. This board was created \"for the investigations and final ascertainment or rejection of all claims of private individuals, whether native or foreigners, to any landed property acquired anterior to the passage of this act.\" (Principles of the Land Commission, 1846) Through the methodical process established by this board they were able to determine the rights held by people within the existing structure in order for the Mhele to take form. In 1848, the Crown and t he ali'i (chief) received their land titles as Konohiki (land manager) Awards. Kuleana (Native land rights) awards to commoners for individual parcels within the ahupuaa were subsequently granted in 1850, and thereafter. Zweng DEA Appendices Page 80 of 317Cultural Surveys Hawai'i Job Code: WAIKANE 5 Introduction Preservation Plan for the Reuse of Taro Loi along Waikne and Waikeekee Streams, on the property of the hulehule Forest Conservancy, Waikn e Ahupuaa, Koolaupoko District, O'ahu Island 31 TMK: (1) 4-8-014:005 and 4 -8-006:001 In 1850, the Privy Council passed resolutions that would affirm the rights of the commoners or native tenants. To apply for fee simple title to their lands, native tenants were required to file their claim with the Land Commission. Surveyor C.J. Lyons stated: Small tenants were permitted to acquire a full title to the lands which they had been improving for their own use...for it was the labor of these people and their ancestors that had made the land what it was. (Lyons 1875:127, cited in Devaney et al. 1982:22) Claims had to be made within the specified time period of February 1846 and February 14, 1848. The Kuleana Act of 1850 confirmed and protected the rights of native tenants. Under this act, the claimant was required to have two witnesses who could testify they knew the claimant and the boundaries of the land, knew that the claimant had lived on the land for a minimum of two years, and knew that no one had challenged the claim; the land also had to be surveyed (Chinen 1958:31). Konohiki Waikne was relinquished by L. Konia and the 'ili of Kahala'a and Kaiiki were relinquished by Kaihiwa and N. Namau'u respectively to Kamehameha III at the time of the Mhele. The ahupua'a and the two aforementioned 'ili we re retained by the Government. (Kingdom of Hawaii 1848) The testimonies recorded during the 1840s in documents associated with Land Commission Awards (LCA) are among the first descriptions of Waikne by the Hawaiians themselves. According to Waihona 'ina land database there were 42 claims made in Waikne. The current Project area contains one LCA and was also part of a large land grant both described below. The LCAs within and adjacent to the Project area are depicted on a 1933 map (Figure 8 ) and the TMK map (previously shown in Figure 2 ), and are listed in Table 2.

There, the boundary line continues to run 19\u00b0 southwest, 2.9 chain lengths, u ntil reaching the ohia tree that is marked \"X\". The boundary line continues 57\u00b03' northwest, 1.46 chain lengths until reaching another candlenut tree that was previously cut down. From there, the boundary line runs 28\u00b03' northeast, 1.46 chain lengths, dissecting the river until reaching the place of commencement. This land segment is 47/100 acres = 568 fathoms. Edwin O. Hall and Henry Dimond received a major grant of land (Grant No. 464, 1,698.48 acres) at Waikne in 1850 f rom Kamehameha III ( Figure 9 ). Hall and Dimond sold the deed to this land on April 30, 1862 for the amount of $1,800 to Elani and others, as is recorded at the Bureau of Conveyances in Honolulu ( Figure 10 ; Deed: Liber 17 - Page 162). The 35 recipients named on this grant formed the Hui-o -Waikne and had rights to \"all those parcels of lands better known as the Ahupuaa of Waikane, Koolaupoko, Oahu aforesaid, together with the water and the fishing rights thereon and there in the Ahupuaa of Waikane\" . Over the years the lands and water right s of Waikne have passed through many hands, including the Waihole Water Company, LL McCandless and his heirs, the military (first the Army and then the Marines) and finally the hulehule Forest Conservancy. Some members of the Hui-o- Waikne still dispute the current ownership of the Waikne lands.

Rice production throughout the islands was attributed primarily to the Chinese: Having first been brought to the islands to serve as sugar plantation laborers, many remained in the Islands following the completion of their contracts. Their accumulation of capital enabled them to rent land and turn to rice cultivation utilizing their traditional knowledge of methods of production which they had brought from China. (Miyagi 1963:106) There were three rice plantations in Waikne in 1880 (Bowser 1880:484 cited in Devaney 1982:51), and 200 acres of land were under rice cultivation in 1892 (Coulter and Chun 1937:72 in Miyagi 1963: 108). An 1897 map of Waikne shows the extent of rice culti vation at that time (Figure 11 ). The Rice Mill shown on Figure 11 in the 'ili of Kamoa is identified as the Waikane Rice Mill in an 1897 directory (Bureau of American Republics 1897:980). The buildings shown adjacent to the rice mill correspond with locations described by Young (1975) as a Chinese School that began instructions in 1912 and another as a gathering place or hang out. Lum Pui Young (1975) was born in Waikne in 1900 and produced a memoir of his early memories of the Chinese community in Waihole, Waikne, and Hakipu'u circa 1906 - 1926. Young (1975:4) refers to the rice mill as Wing Wo Tai rice mill; a Honolulu company with the same name owned the mill in Waikne (Young 1975:3 -4). Waikne Store was also established in the late nineteenth century by Hyung Thom as Wah Chan Store. The store is at 48-377 Kamehameha Highway, just south of Waikne Valley Road. Waikne continued to be rural and primarily dependent on agriculture through the twentieth century. Rice cultivation eventually subsided in importance when a variety of crops were grown in Ko'olaupoko. Mr. Lum Pui Young's memoirs (1975) of his childhood in Waikne relate that rice cultivation in the period of ca. 1906-1926 amounted to some 250 acres with approximately 150 of those acres grown by Sing Tai Wai. Sing Tai Wai employed 20-25 year-round workers and another 15 to 25 itinerant laborers during planting and harvesting time. Young notes that the major transportation link to Honolulu during this time was a daily round-trip by stagecoach owned by Chinese living in Ka'alaea with a terminus at the Wing Wo Tai Mill in Waikne, likely since most of the activities in the region were centered in Waikne. Later transportation was served by a passenger truck owned by Hung Yew Yuen of Waikne. Young (1975) relates that during the period from 1913 to 1917 a contingent of 50 to 60 Chinese males were recruited to work on the Waihole Tunnel Project. The men were hired to construct the railroad bed and trails from the seashore mauka to the tunnel site. All of the tunneling work was conducted by Japanese. Young (1975) notes there were as many Chinese as native Hawaiians living in the region during this period. Following the rice industry's peak in Hawai'i about 1910, it rapidly declined. By 1925, most rice fields were abandoned when the former Chinese residents moved to Honolulu or back to China (Young 1975:5).

Other crops such as introduced vegetables and fruits were grown.

The pineapples were hauled from Waiahole to the Waikane landing by train, and from Waikane were sent by boat to the Libby Cannery at Wailau ... there are still railroad tracks under the heavy brush at Waiahole. (Ferreira 1940:9, cited in Miyagi 1963: 115) The train track used to transport pineapples is likely the same that was constructed by the Waihole Water Company in 1913. Cond\u00e9 and Best wrote that \"ten miles of railroad were built, including an ocean pier. One portion of the railroad was laid at the la nding at Waikane ...\" (1973:337). The railroad was built to transport supplies during the construction of \"an engineering feat of epic proportions,\" the Waihole Tunnel Project through the Ko'olau Mountains that supplied water to the O'ahu Sugar plantation s on the leeward side of the island. Once the tunnel system was complete and operational in 1916, the railroad was removed (Cond\u00e9 and Best 1973:337). 2.10 Waihole/Waikne Tunnel Project and Stream Water Issues Between 1913- 1916 the Waihole ditch and tunnel sy stem was constructed. The system began at Kahana Valley and a series of tunnels were dug through the Ko'olau Mountains. The Waihole Ditch system consists of \"dike -water development tunnels, surface water intakes, open ditches, gates, flumes, siphons, road s, trails, camps\" and other facilities and was designed to channel water from the Waihole Waikne watershed to irrigate Central and Leeward O`ahu sugar cane fields. (State of Hawai i 1997:6) The Oahu Sugar Company was founded in 1897 and flourished because of the use of large ground water aquifers in the Pu'uloa area, water from the Waiawa and Waikele stream were also used. However as the Company continued to expand, these sources were becoming too costly to be pumped to the plateau (Hood 2004). Lincoln McCandless and his brother had financial interests in the Oahu Sugar Company in Waipahu and expansion of the plantation required additional sources of water that could be provid ed with the construction of the Waihole Tunnel. The civil engineer H.K. Bishop started to design and construct the tunnel and Jorgen Jorgensen was brought in to replace him and saw the job to its completion. According to a study conducted of the Waihole, Waikne, Kahana and Punalu'u areas by G.K. Lassison in 1916, these streams produced at least three million gallons daily during dry weather season (at elevations of 500 feet or more above sea level) which no other streams on O'ahu produced. (Hood 2004:31) McCandless sub- leased water rights above the 600 feet elevation for the Waihole Tunnel Project but maintained water rights within the lower elevations of Waikne and Waihole (Griffin and Pyle 1974:12) On May 27, 1916 the tunnel was fully operational and the waters we re diverted from Waihole ( Figure 12 ), Waikne and Kahana Valleys to the Ewa plains. \"From the mid -1916 to 1994, it is estimated that Oahu Sugar Company used an average flow of about 35-40 mgd to Zweng DEA Appendices Page 89 of 317Cultural Surveys Hawai'i Job Code: WAIKANE 5 Introduction Preservation Plan for the Reuse of Taro Loi al ong Waikne and Waikeekee Streams, on the property of the hulehule Forest Conservancy, Waikne Ahupuaa, Koolaupoko District, (1) 4-8-014:005 and 4 -8-006:001 irrigate their fields and that most of this water came from the dyke compartments within the mountains.\" (Hood: 50.) The tunnel ran for 2.7 miles and was the longest transmountain tunnel in Hawai'i until the completion of t he Molokai tunnel. (Hood, 2004:7) There are two deve lopment tunnels at Waikne. Waikne One produces approximately 4.2 MGD and Waikne Two, 1.1 MGD. The total system however produced 24.8 MDG. (State of Hawai i: 1997, 7) In regards to water rights in Waikne, one share of the waters owned by the Hui Aina of Waikane through Royal Patent Grant 464, was leased to Waiahole Water Company on 3 May 1922 for a term of twenty years, expiring in 1942. \"In May of 1992 the Commission designated the five aquifer systems of windward Oahu as ground-water management areas. \" (State of Hawai i: 1997, 3) As the Oahu Sugar Company began shutting down in the mid-1990s, three Windward O`ahu community organizations -the Waihole -Waikne Community Association, u Ohana, and the Kahaluu Neighborhood Board -as well as OHA, KSBE and DHHL petitioned the Water Commission to restore flows to Koolaupoko streams, including Waikne and Waihole Stream and its tributaries. However, these organizations were up against some major economic powerhouses including: the Campbell Estate, the Robinson Trusts, Dole Foods, Del Monte, and the state Departments of Land and Natural Resources and Agriculture, which wanted to continue water diversion to the Ewa plains. Then in December of 1994, the Water Commission directed that 8 million gallons per day would flow through the tunnels to Leeward O ahu and the rest would flow to the windward streams. (State of Hawai i: 1997, 4) Since that 1995 Water Commission decision, further commission actions and court cases have focused on the allocation of water between the windward and leeward sides of the island. However, at present, significantly more water flows daily in Waihole Stream than had been the case until the mid-1990s. While studies on the effects of the restored flow on stream life are ongoing, the likely benefits were summarized by an expert witness in testimony before the Commission on Water Resource Management: \"In general, it is my opinion that restoration, partial or whole, will have beneficial effects on (1) the stream ecosystem...(2) the vegetation of the basins and sub-basins (watersheds)...(3) the estuary and marine waters...and (4) specifically, the stream ecosystems, vegetation, estuary and marine waters affected by the restoration\" (Robert J. Livingston cited in Environment Hawai`i, vol. 7 no. 3 September 1996). A survey was done afte r the water had been returned to the Waihole stream for approximately six months and the Waianu stream about one month and both habitats had shown a promising re- establishment of native populations of 'o'opu, 'opae and hihiwai. Both adult and juvenile spe cies of two types of 'o'opu were observed, which is \"an indication that these species are recruiting or returning from the ocean to the stream.\" (State of Hawai i: 1997, 19) Zweng DEA 90 of 317Cultural Surveys Hawai'i Job Code: WAIKANE 5 Introduction Preservation Plan for the Reuse of Taro Loi al ong Waikne and Waikeekee Streams, on the property of the hulehule Forest Conservancy, Waikne Ahupuaa, Koolaupoko District, O'ahu Island 4 -8-006:001 Figure 12 .

This site is a Forme rly Used Defense Site (FUDS) and has undergone the process of demilitarization. This entire training area was \"used by the Army and marine Corps for training from 1942 to 1976\" (US Army Corps of Engineers 2011). The Department of the Army entered into a lease with Lincoln L. McCandless heirs and Waihole Water Company in 1942 for 1,061 acres, establishing the WVTA. The Army used this training area until 1953 when the Marine Corps was substituted as the lessee. The land was \"utilized for advanced training in offensive warfare and air -to-ground prac tice bombing\" during World War II and the Marine Corps continued this type of training after assuming the lease in 1953. The weapons used in this training area were kept under certain restrictions due to hazardous fire conditions and certain weapons use were restricted to designated impact zones within the training area. Training in this area has been a threat to the local community and in May of 1944 \"a 60 millimeter mortar... which killed two and injured others\" (US Army Corps of Engineers 2011). The munitions were found in the valley by several boys. Three children were also injured some years later in 1963 when a rifle grenade was reportedly found in Waikne Valley and thrown against a wall. (Cole 2011) No other incidents have been reported since then. However, when ordnance sweeps were conducted in 1976 and 1984 tens of thousands of pounds of ordnance and fragments were removed. \"The 1976 clearance effort resulted in the removal of over 24,000 pounds of practice ordnance and fragments, including 42 items of unexploded ordnance (UXO). In June 1984, an intensive ordnance clearance resulted in the removal of 16,000 pounds of demilitarized practice ordnance and 190 items of UXO from the parcel.\" (US Army Corps of Engineers 2011) The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is undergoing investigations to determine the extent of the damage to this valley and has committed to clean up and removal at two sites within the WTA. The US Marines are also currently undergoing a separate investigation for the WVIA. An inventory project report conducted in 1996 determined that this former training site met the requirements to be eligible for the Defense Environmental Restoration Program. \"Congress established the FUDS Program in the mid- 1980's to restore properties formerly owned, lea sed to, or otherwise processed by the United States and under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Defense\" (US Army Corps of Engineers 2011). The US Marines abandoned a plan to use this training area in 2003 because the unexploded ordinance on site was too dense, making the planned blank-fire jungle training in the valley too dangerous. (Cole 2011) Kyle Kajihiro, a current member of the restoration advisory board for the Waikne Valley stated that, \"it [Waikne] should be cleaned up to the highest level possible to allow the broadest number of uses,\" Kajihiro said. He added that those uses \"need to be mindful of, and consistent with, Uncle Raymond Kamaka and his family's vision and uses of the land -- which were agricultural and cultural uses\" (Cole 2011). The access to clean water is a concern Zweng DEA Appendices Page 92 of 317Cultural Surveys Hawai'i Job Code: WAIKANE 5 Introduction Preservation Plan for the Reuse of Taro Loi al ong Waikne and Waikeekee Streams, on the property of the hulehule Forest Conservancy, Waikne Ahupuaa, Koolaupoko District, O'ahu Island 43 TMK: (1) 4-8-014:005 and 4 -8-006:001 for this vision due to the results of a site investigation study was completed in 2008 focusing on the WTA, testing the strea m water and sediment from the Waikne stream for list metals and explosives. The results of the test resulted in contaminants of potential concern, including \"chromium, iron, vanadium, cobalt, mercury and RDX\" (US Army Corps of Engineers 2011). However, as late as 1984 there has been documentation of the use of the valley for religious purposes. In 1984, Welch and Streck prepared an archaeological survey report for the Commanding Officer Marine Corps Air Station, Kneohe Bay describing a Hawaiian shrine in Waikne Valley (SIHP #50 -80-06-2889) and evaluating the impact of an ordinance removal project. The shrine consisted of an ahu or stone cairn, a terrace, two basalt retaining walls, and a circular petroglyph located on a ridge, known as Mortar Hill, above the valley at about 90 m above mean sea level. This study also assigned SIHP #50-80 -06-2890 to another adjacent complex of abandoned taro loi, which were evidently in production as late as 1928 when aerial photographs of the valley were taken. \"Al and Ra y Kamaka say that the shrine is currently used as a family heiau to make offerings of crops and to chant to Lono, the god of rain and agriculture\" (Welch and Streck 1984:14).

The community was fighting for this purchase in order to avoid evictions from their lands ( Figure 13 ). \"The purchase was contested by Windward Partners, a hui that had been put together by developer Joe Pao, and which had itself acquired an option to purchase the land.\" (Environment Hawaii 1994) The State paid $6 million to acquire this land in the hopes of developing what was to be called the Waihole Agricultural Park. The initial funding for the purchase came from Hawai'i Housing Authority (HHA) later known as Housing Financial and Development Corporation (HFDC) who took the lead in the planning. They began \"negotiating long term leases with the Waihole -Waikne Community Association, which represents most of the farmers in the valley\" and were looking at ways to develop the necessary infrastructure to support the farm and house lots. Of the 600 acres, \"365 are to be teased for agricultural use, 52 acres leased for residential, and almost all the remainder (including steep sloped land) will be open space\" (Environment Hawaii 1994).

The Waikne Nature Preserve included TMK Wa ikne ahupua'a. TMK parcel [1] 4-8-004:004 (45.6 acres) is a part of Grant 464 (Kamehameha III to Dimond and Hall). Portions of Grant 464 are shown as being a part of the lands granted by Elizabeth Loy Marks to Windward Partners on 30 July 1975. Portions of Grant 464 were also granted to Pan-Pacific Development Inc. by Phoenix Limited Partnership in July 1987. This royal patent was conveyed in a deed made between E.O. Hall and Henry Dimond to Elani and others whose names are listed in the deed dated 30 April 1862 . 2.11.4 Current and Future Land Uses The land on which the current project area rests was part of the Former Waikne Valley Training Area (FWVTA). This site is a Formerly Used Defense Site (FUDS) and has undergone the process of demilitarization. This entire training area was used by the Army and Marine Corps for training from 1942 to 1976; there is also evidence that the land is currently being used by hunters, hikers and moto-cross/ATV enthusiasts. After the ordnance clearance was completed, large portions of the FWVTA were purchased by hulehule Forest Conservancy, LLC and a number of revitalization projects were planned: planting of native species in three separate forest restoration areas; an organic cacao farm in the lowlands; protecting the only know n elepaio (Chasiempis ibidis --listed as endangered) nesting grounds on the windward side of Oahu ; and the restoration and reuse of historic taro loi along Waikne and Waikeekee Streams, addressed here. There are also plans to improve/realign the existing road and build a single family residence.

Rasmussen 2008 Archaeological Survey and Monitoring 10 historic properties were documented and included archaeological sites associated with pre-Contact traditional Hawaiian taro cultivation and post -Contact charcoal manufacturing Hammatt 2012 Literature Review and Field Inspection No new sites recorded, and an effect determination of \"no historic properties affected\" within the area of the hulehule Forest Conservancy 's Proposed Cacao Farm Project Altizer, Rivera and Monahan 2012 Archaeological Monitoring for UXO Clearance Documentation of 37 cultural resources recorded as part of that project. Eleven of these were fou nd to be unrecorded features of previously identified sites, including SIHP 4356. T. Stell Newman (1972), archaeologist with the Division of State Parks, conducted a survey along Waikne Stream in 1970 as part of the state -wide site inventory. Two historic properties were identified: SIHP 50-80 -06-1057, a partial rectangular enclosure along the north bank of Waikne Stream approximately 1 kilometer inland from Waikne Town; and SIHP 50 -80-06- 1078, a series of taro terraces in the upper reaches of Waikne S tream including flat beds and two beds with remnants of interior mounds and numerous ' auwai . Newman recommended preserving the area as a nature park. SIHP - 1078, Waikne Taro Flats with boundaries defined to include a large area beyond the known features, was nominated by Newman to the National Register of Historic Places and listed in the Register on April 11, 1973. On October 20, 1977, a field visit was made by Nathan Napoka and the Kamaka family (local informants) to the Waikne Valley to examine the historic taro loi. The Kamakas identified seven sites; taro fields and \"Wai o kane\" spring, \"Manu kolea\" (a guardian stone and a lower male and female rock), a house site and ditches, \"Puu Menehune\" (a circular hill constructed of cinder built by the menehu ne), \"Pohaku wela\" Surveys Hawai'i Job Code: WAIKANE 5 Introduction Preservation Plan for the Reuse of Taro Loi along Waikne and Waikeekee Streams, on the property of the hulehule Forest Conservancy, Waikne Ahupuaa, Koolaupoko District, O'ahu Island 48 TMK: (1) 4-8-014:005 and 4 -8-006:001 (a famous mountain peak on the Kahana side of Waikne Valley), and Kukuianiani Heiau.

PHRI (Walker and Rosendahl 1990) carried out an intensive archaeological survey of a 50- foot wide fence corridor project bounding TMK: 4-8 -14:6 in central Waikne Valley. This study historic properties (SIHP 50-80 -06-1078, -4116 and -4117 with a total of seven component features) including four agricultural terraces, an agricultural mound and 'auwai and a boulder alignment foundation remnant of a road. In 1992, Paul H. Rosendahl, Ph.D., Inc. (PHRI) carried out an archaeological inventory survey of an approximately 407 acre proposed SMF/HDI Golf Course study area in central Waikne Valley identifying thirteen historic properties with 100 component features all within stream basins (Dunn et al. 1992). Most of the features (68) were pre-contact agricultural features; nine features were related to historic charcoal production, three to temporary habitation, and one to a ceremonial function. SIHP 50-80 -06-4356 appeared to have been a major pre-contact/post- contact agricultural complex with forty-six designated features. Eight 14C dates were reported, the oldest of which was AD 1400-1640. International Archaeological Research Institute, Inc., (IARII) conducted a Cultural Resource Assessment in 2004 which detailed previously undocumented features within the boundaries of NRHP listed Site 1078 and along Waikne Stream, which were included in Site 2890 (Magnuson, Peterson and Carson 2004). It also described a newly recorded traditional cultural property (TCP) 50-80-06-6551. Ethnographic interviews of Waikne reside nts were conducted to consider the cultural significance of Sites 2889 and 6551, and other elements of Waikne Valley, including a rock birthing stone ( hanau ) at Site 2890. It was recommended that the boundaries o f NRHP eligible Site 2890 be expanded to include previously undocumented archaeological features along Waikne Stream. Sites 4116 and 4117 were determined not eligible for the NRHP and recommended they be de-listed . In 2008, International Archaeological Research Institute, Inc., (IARII) conducted an archaeological survey and monitoring at the F ormer Waikne Valley Training Area (FWVTA) in anticipation of ordnance assessment and removal operations (Rasmussen 2008). The IARII study area (approximately 900-acre s) completely encompasses the curren t project area. Rasmussen (2008) identifie d two new sites during the survey portion of the project: SIHP #50-80 -06-6861, a set of four associated terraces defining four agricultural fields in the far northwestern portion of the FWVTA, and SIHP #50-80 -10-6862, a set of six foxholes in the Southeastern Region. In addition to these new sites, Rasmussen (2008) also revisited and documented new features at the Zweng DEA Appendices Page 98 of 317Cultural Surveys Hawai'i Job Code: WAIKANE 5 Introduction Preservation Plan for the Reuse of Taro Loi along Waikne and Waikeekee Streams, on the property of the hulehule Forest Conservancy, Waikne Ahupuaa, Koolaupoko District, O'ahu Island 49 (1) National Register site \"Waikane her investigation, Rasmussen (2008:iii) concluded the documented cultural resources in the valley represent \". . . part of a landscape of traditional Hawaiian taro production and later historic period charcoal manufacturing that likely occurred alongside the taro production.\" These planting sites were located along the alluvial flats near streams, and probable habitation sites were present on higher ground near these fields. Rasmussen also noted that metal tools found in association with some cultivated fields indicate these were being farmed into the early 20th century, an observation that is consistent with oral- historical information from local families who report such activities into the 1920s. Between May and A ugust 2011, Cultural Surveys Hawaii (CSH) provided archaeological monitoring for UXO clearance activities within the Former Waikne Valley Training Area (FWVTA). The resulting report (Altizer, Rivera and Monahan 2012) details the documentation of 37 cultural resources recorded as part of that project (given temporary CSH site numbers). Eleven of these were found to be features of previously identified sites, including SIHP 4356. The documentation of these features is very brief owing to the limited time and access granted by the transect methodology and safety requirements of UXO personnel.

DESCRIPTION: The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. According to NRHP (1972): The upp er reache s of Waikane Valley contains [sic] an area where numerous old Hawaiian taro terraces are found. These terraces are flat bottomed areas near th e stream b ed, eac h with a low stone retaining wall about .5 meter high on the down stream side. The ave rage size of the taro flats i s about 6 by 1 2 meters ... [a]ssociated with the wet taro beds (loi) are several enclosures, habitation areas, and one large pit. Scattered through out th e area are a few rock alignments of unknown function. In one area, remains of the old auwai, or irrigation ditch , could be seen, which fed water from the nearby stream in th e loi in success ion ... [t]he se taro flats at Waikane are of significance for they are excellently preserved exam ples of old Hawaiia n wet taro loi. They co ntain the only known examples of taro loi with interior mound s, used in a speciali zed taro growing techniqu e. Associated habitation areas, and some indication of agriculture on the talus valley slopes, lend additional importance to this complex, particularly in the breadth of possible interpretation ... [o]f all the known taro loi on Oahu, this is the second most important, exceeded only by the great taro loi at Kahaluu, some miles to the south. This complex certainly is worth of preserving this important aspect of ancient Hawaiian agricultural proficiency (NRH P 1972:2-3). Since the site was placed on the register, numerous archaeological studies have re-visited the area and added features, expanding the site to its current extent. Today the site consists of 7 'terrace sets' and numerous other associated features. The following descriptions are from Rasmussen 2008. Terrace Set 1 is located within the U.S. Marine controlled property on the south side of Waikne Stream. I t was described by Magnuson et al. 2004:51-57. It consists of five terraced fields with eight embankment walls. They were constructed by Mr. Alfred Morita in the 1960s using a bulldozer.

The set is about 53 m square and consists of 11 terraced fields with 11 embankment walls. Most of the embankment walls range in height from 70 to 110 cm. One wall, extending from north to south n ear the northern end of the terrace set adjacent to a possible auwai, was 20 cm. An Agricultural Shrine is located between Terrace Set 2 and Terrace Set 3. It was identified by Mr. Morita a member of the Kamaka family, during a site tour in 2003. The shrine is located on the north side of the northern branch of the Waikne Stream, about 90 m from the junction of the northern and southern branches. The shrine consists of large boulders resting against one another to form a crevice or cupboard. There are about five terrace walls extending in a direction parallel to the stream near the shrine; two west of the shrine two east of the shrine, and one that extends out from the shrine. There may have been additional walls, however, the area has been disturbed by pig wallows and erosion. Mr. Morita said his grandparents used to farm in this portion of the valley and used the shrine. He continued to farm until the 1960s in the portion of Site 1078 located within the U.S. Marine controlled area (Mr. Alfred Morita pers. comm. 2003). Across the stream from Mr. Morita's family shrine is a large upright stone. It appears to have been purposefully placed in this position. Although Mr. Morita did not discuss this feature, it may be part of a cairn or ahu. No cul tural material was observed around this feature. A birthing stone was also pointed out by Mr. Morita. It is located within Waikne Stream at the junction between the northern and southern branch. Terrace Set 3 is located about 62 m north of Terrace Set 1 along the north branch of Waikne Stream. It is located on the east side of the stream and is 140 by 35 111. The southern section is eroded, apparently from runoff from a side gulch. The terrace set consists of 12 terraced fields with 19 embankment walls. They range in height between 15 and 70 cm. A separate terraced area with three embankment walls is located on high ground in the southern section. Although it is eroded and the rocks scattered, apparently from runoff from a side gulch, the terrace walls are 40 cm high. It is possible the side gulch was used to water this field or this area may have been used for habitation or storage since it is above the stream. Terrace Set 4 is located on the opposite (west) side of Waikne Stream from Terrace Set 3, about 7 m northwest. The terrace set is 103 by 34 m. A functioning auwai or small ditch with running water is located in the middle of the site and is fed from a spring. Most of the area to the west of the auwa i is very wet and muddy with thick hau. It appears that terrace walls may have once been present, however , they were not visible during the survey and may be buried below the ground surface. Two walls were present in this area along the edge of the stream, which were about 80 cm high. The area east of the auwa i is in excellent condition. Five fields with ten terraced walls are present. They range in height from 25 to 70 cm. A rusted shovel fragment was observed near a mango tree in the northern portion of the site, suggesting this area was farmed during the post-Contact period. Zweng DEA Appendices Page 102 of 317Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: WAIKANE 5 Historic Properties Preservation Plan for the Reuse of Taro Loi along Waikne and Waikeekee Streams, on the property of the hulehule Forest Conservancy, Waikne Ahupuaa, Koolaupoko District, O'ahu Island 53 TMK: (1) 4-8-014:005 and 4 -8-006:001 Terrace Set 5 is located on the northwest side of the juncture between the north and south branches of Waikne Stream, about 15 m west of Terrace Set 1 . It extends about 135 m along the north side of the south branch of Waikne Stream and is about 35 m wide. The terrace set consists of 27 fields with approximately 18 terraced walls perpendicular to the south branch of Waikne Stream and 17 parallel. The walls may meander and some are partially eroded, making counting problematical. The southern portion of the site nearest the stream is eroded. Remnants of terraced walls are present, some of which may extend below the existing, upper walls; this suggest the terraces have been rebuilt and reconfigured over time. A rusted hoe and metal bit, possibly from a digging stick, were observed . [...] These tools suggest the terrace set was in production during the post-Contact period. Terrace Set 5 was originally recorded by Dunn et al. (1992:A-30 - A-37), who assigned 30 features to the terrace set. It included a ceremonial mound (Feature A1), 28 terraces (Features B1 through C2), and an alignment (Feature 02). A sketch of the eastern portion of the terrace set is shown in the report (Dunn et al. 1992:A-31 ), which includes the ceremonial mound, a habitation terrace, and 13 agricultural fields. No indication is presented within the report to indicate why Feature A1 is classified as a ceremonial mound. This portion of the site currently appears to be a naturally raised basalt outcrop on which rocks have been moved aside to provide a somewhat level area above the north branch of Waikne Stream. No evidence of upright stones, religious artifacts, or offerings is present. It is adjacent to Feature B1 , described as a habitation terrace, and is more likely to be related to habitation activities. Further research and excavation would be necessary to determine the purpose of the cleared outcrop (Feature A1) before a designation such as \"ceremonial\" should be attributed. Although it is possible a non-wetland crop was grown in Terrace Feature B1, it was more likely used for storage or shelter, as suggested by subsurface excavations conducted by Dunn et al. (1992:A-30 - A-32). A 50 by 50 cm test unit excavated at this feature uncovered t wo sedimentary layers, each containing cultu ral materials. Layer I extended from 0 to 54 cm below surface. Basalt and volcanic glass flakes and a hammerstone were uncovered. A calibrated date of A.D. 1400-1640 was obtained from charcoal recovered from the base of this layer. Layer II is 54 to 64 cm below surface. Volcanic glass was recovered from this layer, which appeared to extend below the structural components of the feature. Two other raised, level areas are present near this terrace set: one is about 5 m northwest of Feature A1 . It was covered with vegetation until cleared by Zapata Engineering (Grid 10). Excavations conducted by Zapata Engineering exposed a plastic spoon, a can, and a clear glass soda bottle. MEC personnel said the spoon and can were consistent with material from C-Rations; however there were no markings on the spoon or can to indicate their origin or manufacturing date. The second level area is located on the lower, southeastern side of a finger ridge that divides Terrace Set 5 from Terrace Set 6. There was no surface indication of features. Excavations in Grid 90 by MEC personnel exposed a thin cultural deposit with one volcanic glass flake, one basalt flake, and burn t kuku i. Zweng DEA Appendices 103 of 317Cultural Surveys Hawai' i Job Code: WAIKANE 5 Historic Properties Preservation Plan for the Reuse of Taro Loi along Waikne and Waikeekee Streams, on the property of the hulehule Forest Conservancy, Waikne Ahupuaa, Koolaupoko District, O'ahu (1) 4-8-014:005 and 4 -8-006:001 A tear-shaped charcoal kiln excavated i nto the hillside [...] is located on the west side of Terrace Set 5. It is 4.0 by 3.6m and rises from 50 cm at the entrance to 180 cm at the rear. The interior is rock-lined, about three to four courses (60 cm). A level area, 3 to 4 m wide, is located in front (south) of the kiln. An overgrown dirt road was observed on the finger ridge north of Terrace 5. Portions of the road were cut into the side of the hill and reinforced with rocks on the down slope side. Sections of the road have been washed out. It terminates at about 600 ft in elevation. The dirt road is shown on the USGS map, but not the early maps for the valley. It may have been built to access the watershed in the early 1900s and then reused or constructed by the military in the 1940s. It does not appear to have been recently used or maintained, since it was very over grown and washed out. Ter race Set 6 is located about 50 m northwest of Terrace Set 5, on the northern side of the southern branch of Waikne Stream. It is I10m long and parallels the stream and 50 m wide. There are about 21 fields with 13 terraced walls perpendicular to the stream and about 9 walls parallel to the stream. The walls range in height from 30 to 80 cm. The southern portion of the terrace set is highly eroded and the terrace walls terminate in alluvial gravel deposited by the stream. A proba ble auwai is located at the western, upstream, side of the terrace set. It appears to have once flowed along the back, hillside portion of the site. Gaps in the terrace walls may have been gates to help regulate the water flow. The eastern side of the terrace set contains fragments of terrace walls and historic artifacts such as Asian pottery sherds and bottle fragments. Although there may have been rectangular fields in this location, they have been washed away. A horseshoe and unidentified rusted metal object were uncovered within Grid 220 by Zapata Engineering. An isolated, small rectangular area was recorded about 15 m above the northern portion or the terrace set. It is 2.1 by 1.8 m and has been excavated into the side of the hill. Stacked cobbles and small boulders, two to three courses high, are present at the entrance; there is a break in the stacking to form an opening 75 cm wide. Two boulders are present above the level area. The purpose of this feature is not apparent. Although it resembles a charcoal kiln in the fact that it is excavated into the side of a hill, it is not shaped like other kilns in Waikne Valley. It seems likely the feature is a charcoal kiln; however, it may be a storage area or temporary habitation area. Terrace Set 7 is located 16 m northwest of Terrace Set 6, on an alluvial bend in the southern branch or Waikne Stream. The western side of the terrace set is a highly eroded gulch. The terrace set is 36 by 7.3 m. Two terrace walls are located west of the eroded gulch, suggesting that they once were connected to the terrace set on the east side. It appears that heavy stream flow may have rushed through the center of the terrace site, eroding the upper 2 m of sediment. Seven or possibly eight terrace wall remnants are present perpendicular to the stream on the east side, whereas only two remain on the west side. They range in height from 50 to 60 cm. None of the walls are parallel to the stream.

The site consists of four loi sets (Terrace Sets 1 to 4), a level area above the terraces containing charcoal and firepit features, remnant alignments, three charcoal kilns, and a remnant of a historic road. This site was originally recorded by Dunn et al. (1992:A-5 - A-18), who identified 30 terraces, six charcoal kilns, six alignments, two ditches, a rubble concentration, and a mound. During the field work for Rasmussen 2008, a detailed site map was drawn to scale and matched to the Feature designations assigned by Dunn et al. (1992) based on labeled fragments of blue flagging tape. Terrace Set 1 consists of the westernmost loi located along Waikeekee Stream. It is about 76 by 32 m in size and extends along the south bank of the stream. A sketch map of Terrace Set 1, showing 10 of the fields (Features A through H, L, and RR), was includ ed in the original report (Dunn et al. 1992:A-7). A test unit excavated within one of the long retaining walls, located between fields designated Features F and H, uncovered remnant portions of a buried retaining wall at 50 cm below surface. No cultural material was observed. A trail was recorded at the west end of the loi. It zigzags up the side of the finger ridge. The trail is about a meter wide and appears to have stone berms supporting the down slope edges. The trail leads to a relatively flat area at the base of a finger ridge above the fields. No surface features were apparent, however, excavations by Zapata Engineering within the grids located in this area uncovered two possible fire pits with charcoal and a piece of volcanic glass, The ordnance excavations are small ranging in size from 10 to 20 cm wide and generally 15 to 40 cm deep, During examination of these excavations, the archaeologist cleaned and straightened the sidewalls, Since charcoal was observed at the base of the excavation, an additional 5to 10 cm of soil was excavated at the base, revealing the presence of red earth that appears to have been fire- affected, thus suggesting a fire pit. Terrace Set 2 is located on the north side of Waikeekee Stream about 7m from the east end of Terrace Set 1. Although this area was recorded by Dunn et al. (1992), no site maps were included within the report and it is difficult to ascertain which features were assigned which designation. Therefore, the features designations shown on the site map for Terrace Set 2 are based on feature descriptions, some of which appear to have confused the orientation and do not contain information about the location or nearby features. Terrace Set 2 extends along Waike ekee Stream for 64 m. It is 17 m wide. Three leve l loi fields are present, however, it appears that an additional field was present in the west end of the side due to the presence of a terrace wall (designated as Feature I). This area is now partially eroded and no longer level. Dunn et al. (1992:A-12) describe another feature, designated as Feature J, which is located across from Terrace Set 1 and west of Feature I, that \"consists of a buried or eroded retaining wall with remnants of basalt facing ... in association with Feature J is a broad area ... [that] is possibly a buried terrace system, due to the nature and appearance of the area and the presence of scattered basalt cobbles. \" During the current survey, no identifiable Zweng DEA Appendices Page 107 of 317Cultural Surveys Hawai'i Job Code: WAIKANE 5 Historic Properties Preservation Plan for the Reuse of Taro Loi along Waikne and Waikeekee Streams, on the property of the hulehule Forest Conservancy, Waikne Ahupuaa, Ko olaupoko District, TMK: (1) 4-8-014:005 and 4 -8-006:001 terraces were present on the north side of Terrace Set 1 . This area was highly eroded by the stream and only scattered cobbles and small boulders were present. The area contained standing water and loam, making the area very muddy. It is highly possible this area was at one time a loi. Two perpendicular terrace walls are present at Terrace Set 2, which range in length from 7 to 13 m. They appear to be composed of rock with an overlay of loam. Additional research is necessary to determine if this is actually how these features were constructed and not an erosional component. Two parallel terrace walls extend along the streamside of the terrace; one located at the western end of the terrace and the other at the eastern end. Although they may have been joined at one time, the stream has eroded the area (29 m) between them. The western wall is 14 m long and the eastern wall is 17 m. An auwai , which appears to be designated as Feature SS, is located at the back (north) portion of Terrace Set 2. The original feature description notes that it is on the north side of the stream and that it terminates at Feature A, which is on the south side of the stream at Terrace Set I. A small piece of blue flagging tape with SS written on it was found sticking up from the mud at the auwai in Terrace Set 2, suggesting that it is actually located at the latter terrace. The takeoff point for the auwai is located at the western end of the site, just east of Feature I. It extends about 34 m and is 1.5 m wide. About 20 to 22 m east from the takeoff point the auwai appears to be rock lined. One charcoal kiln is located in the western side of Terrace Set 2, north of the auwai . It is excavated into the hill, 4 m long and 3.5 m wide. The kiln may be Feature K, however, it appears to be smaller (2.34 by 3.10 m) than the one recorded during the current project. The feature description mentions a small drainage in the front of the kiln, but does not mention if it is an auwai or if it is Feature SS. A 50 by 50 cm test unit was excavated into the base of Feature K by Dunn et al. (1992:A-12). A layer of charcoal was found at 20 to 25 cm below surface. The sediment above the charcoal is described as an erosional deposit. A partially buried roll of communication wire and an ammunition box was observed at the east end of the terrace set, indicating use of the area during training purposes by the U.S. military. Terrace Set 3 is located 48 m downstream (southwest) of Terrace Set 2. It appears to include Features U through X (Dunn et al. 1992:A-14 - A 15). An old bend in the stream is located on the west side of the terrace set. A new, less sharp bend, is 9.5 to 13 m east of the old bend. Since the terrace walls (Features U and an unnamed terrace wall south of Feature V) line up on both sides of the new bend, it appears to indicate the new bend in the stream occurred after the terrace set was constructed. It may have been partially caused by diversion of water through an auwai or by rutting caused during removal of charcoal along a possible dirt road that roughly parallels the stream and appears to overlay the terrace walls. The upper, northern portion, of Terrace Set 3 is divided into six fields. The terrace walls (Features S, T, and W) are between 9 and 17 m in length and range in height from 40 to 60 cm. Portions of the terrace are eroded both along the stream and the old bend in the stream. The mid- northern and southeastern terrace walls are earthen berms. The other terrace walls are Zweng DEA Appendices Page 108 of 317Cultural Surveys Hawai'i Job Code: WAIKANE 5 Historic Properties Preservation Plan for the Reuse of Taro Loi along Waikne and Waikeekee Streams, on the property of the hulehule Forest Conservancy, Waikne Ahupuaa, Ko olaupoko District, O'ahu Island 59 TMK: (1) 4-8-014:005 and 4 -8-006:001 constructed of rocks. This northern portion of the terrace set contains numerous mango trees, which were hazardous during fruiting season. A small knoll is located on the east side of the sharp bend in the stream, roughly in the middle of Terrace Set 3. Two small alignments with a level area in between are located on top of the knoll. It is designated as Feature V, a possible habitation area (Dunn et al. 1992:A-14). During the initial survey by Dunn et al. (1992:A-14), four traditional Hawaiian artifacts were collected: a basalt whetstone, a basalt core, and two basalt flakes. A 50 by 50 cm test unit was excavated to a depth of 50 cm below surface at this location; however, no cultural materials were observed. Fea ture U, on the west side of the stream (19 m long and 85 cm high) and the terrace wall on the east side of the stream (15 m long and 70 cm high) form the southernmost fields in Terrace Set 3. These two terrace walls extend parallel to the stream. A 4.5 m long and 10 cm high wall extends away from it in a perpendicular direction. As mentioned above, these fields appear to have been created before the stream channel divided this area. It appears there may have been two or three small fields, although only one level area remains. A charc oal kiln, designated as Feature X, is located at the southern end of Terrace Set 3. It is 4.4 by 2.5 m is size. The front of the kiln is partially eroded by Waike ekee Stream. Only the northeast side of the entrance appears intact with stacked basalt rock about 40 cm high. The rear of the kiln is excavated into the hill, about 190 cm. A 50 by 50 cm test unit was excavated into the base of the kiln by Dunn et al. (1992:A -15). One layer was encountered, which consisted of 35 cm of decomposing bedrock. No cultural material was observed. Terrace Set 4 is the southernmost set of terraces in Site 4356. It is about 125 m downstream from Terrace Set 3, in a northeast direction. The terrace set is about 82 by 22 m, and located at the bend in Waikeekee Stream, along the south and east side. The junction between Waikeekee and Waikne Stream is about 250 m downstream. The terr ace set consists of 10 fields divided by live to six terrace walls (Features HH to possibly MM). Six of the terrace walls extend in a north to south direction, perpendicular to the stream. They are about 13 m long and 30 to 40 cm high. They appear to be constructed of both rock and a combination of rock with a soil overlay. Two short (4 m long) remnants of terrace walls in the west side of the terrace set are parallel to the stream; there appears to be no terrace wall parallel to the stream in the east side. An auwa i with PVC pipe within it is located in the middle of the terrace set, which extends in a west to east direction. Another auwai or small ditch is located 3.5 to 9 m north, towards the stream. It is about 75 m long and follows the curve in Waikeekee Stream. These two auwai do not appear to have been recorded by Dunn et al. (1992). A small, raised terrace (4.7 by 6 m and 40 cm high) is located in the southeast side of the terrace set near the hillside, on the south side of Feature II. Although it may be an agricultural terrace, it appears to be a habitation or storage area located above the loi. An alignment of rocks is present on the west side of Waikeekee Stream across from the terraces. Dunn et al. designated it as Feature FF and noted that although it is \"heavily eroded, it does appear to have the remnants of terracing to it\" (1992:A 16). This feature was examined Zweng DEA Appendices Page 109 of 317Cultural Surveys Hawai'i Job Code: WAIKANE 5 Historic Properties Preservation Plan for the Reuse of Taro Loi along Waikne and Waikeekee Streams, on the property of the hulehule Forest Conservancy, Waikne Ahupuaa, Ko olaupoko District, O'ahu Island 60 TMK: (1) 4-8-014:005 and 4 -8-006:001 during the current project and appears to be a remnant of a road that extends along Waikeekee Stream. The rock alignment appears to be the remnants of a retaining wall or berm for the road. A charcoal kiln, designated as Feature EE by Dunn et al. (1992:A-16), is also located on the west side of Waikeekee Stream, across from the terraces. Communication wire was observed inside the kiln during the original survey. It was not observed during the current survey. The kiln is 5.3 by 3.6 m in size and rises from 60 cm at the front to 240 cm at the rear. The entrance is about 0.7 m wide, and const ructed of stacked basalt cobbles and boulders about three to four courses high. The interior of the kiln does not appear to be rock lined. A boulder with historic petroglyphs was observed between Terrace Sets 3 and 4, along the west side of Waikeekee Stream. Zapata Engineering Stake TS-E-5 is located just east of the boulder. The charcoal k iln (Feature EE) is about 66 m northeast. The boulder is subrounded saprolite and easily marked, as indicated by the new machete gouges near the petroglyphs. Two older petroglyphs were observed on the east side of the boulder: the initials \"J\" and possibly \"T\" on the south end and a five-pointed star on the north end. These petroglyphs are post-Contact and may relate the use of the road and charcoal kilns during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They may also be from soldiers using the area for training practice during WWII, or others using the valley. In addition to the features recorded by Dunn et al. 1992 and Rasmussen 2008, a number of temporary sites were recorded in the immediate vicinity by Altizer, Rivera and Monahan 2012 which were later designated as features of the existing SIHP. The locations of these sites were mapped using a GARMIN GPSMAP60Cx unit (accuracy \u00b1 2 -5 m), and not mapped relative to previously documented features; in some cases these may be extensions of previously documented features. 3.1.2.1 Temporary Site CSH 21 (SIHP #50- 80-10-4356) FORMAL SITE TYPE: Terrace NO. OF FEATURES: 1 DIMENSIONS: 2.0 m long by 0.2 -0.3 m high CONDITION AT GROUND SURFACE: Poor FUNCTIONAL INTERPRETATION: Traditional Agriculture AGE INTERPRETATION: Either or both Pre -Contact/Post-Contact DESCRIPTION: CSH 21 is a terrace located in the eastern portion of the Southern Impact Region. It is in relatively poor physical condition, consisting of a one-course boulder alignment measuring 2.0 m long by 0.2 -0.3 m high. CSH 21 is within the site complex previously- identified as SIHP #50- 80-10-4356 by Dunn et al. (1992). Site 4356 was originally described as having 46 component features including terraces, alignments, depressions and mounds (Dunn et al. 1992). Later, Rasmussen (2008) also noted the presence of 'auwai , a trail, loi fields and charcoal kilns. The terrace designated CSH 21 appears to be part of Site 4356, an extensive traditional Hawaiian agricultural complex dating from either or both pre- Contact/post-Contact times. 3.1.2.2 Temporary Site CSH 22 (SIHP SITE Terrace 110 of 317Cultural Surveys Hawai'i Job Code: WAIKANE 5 Historic Properties Preservation Plan for the Reuse of Taro Loi along Waikne and Waikeekee Streams, on the property of the hulehule Forest Conservancy, Waikne Ahupuaa, Ko olaupoko District, O'ahu Island TMK: and 4 -8-006:001 NO. OF FEATURES: Numerous DIMENSIONS: Indeterminate CONDITION AT GROUND SURFACE: Indeterminate FUNCTIONAL INTERPRETATION: Traditional Agriculture AGE INTERPRETATION: Either or both Pre-Contact/Post-Contact DESCRIPTION: CSH 22 is a terrace complex in the northern portion of the Southern Impact Region. CSH archaeologists observed five agricultural terraces, a trail with stone curbing, and a possible charcoal kiln. CSH 22 is part of a terrace complex (SIHP #50-80-10 -4356) previously documented by Dunn et al. (1992) and Rasmussen (2008). Site 4356 is a particularly large and extensive set of agricultural terraces, rock alignments, possible loi field, charcoal kilns and 'auwai . The terrace complex designated CSH 22 appears to be part of Site 4356, an extensive traditional Hawaiian agricultural complex dating from either or both Pre-Contact/post-Contact times. 3.1.2.3 Temporary Site CSH 23 (Portion in Western Limits of SIHP #50-80 -10-4356) FORMAL SITE TYPE: Trail NO. OF FEATURES: 2 (uncertain) DIMENSIONS: Indeterminate CONDITION AT GROUND SURFACE: Indeterminate FUNCTIONAL INTERPRETATION: Pedestrian Transportation AGE INTERPRETATION: Indeterminate DESCRIPTION: CSH 23 is a trail in the northern portion of the Southern Impact Region. The trail is present on both sides of Waikeekee Stream. The trail, which is oriented roughly mauka to makai (east- to-west), does not exhibit any formal features; it is still in use today given its current state of wear. Further investigation is required to determine its full extent. The eastern portion of CSH 23 documented by CSH during the current project is within the depicted (geo- referenced) location (western limits) of SIHP #50-80 -10-4356, which Dunn et al. (1992) described as having 46 features including terraces, alignments, depressions and mounds. Rasmussen (2008) noted the presence of 'auwai , a trail, loi fields and charcoal kilns. CSH 23 may be the trail identified by Rasmussen (2008) at this site complex. It seems unlikely the trail can be dated with any specificity. 3.1.2.4 Temporary Site CSH 32 (SIHP #50-80 -10-4356) FORMAL SITE Modified Boulder (with Petroglyphs) NO. OF FEATURES: Indeterminate DIMENSIONS: 1.7 m long by 1.2 m wide by 1.4 m high (boulder dimensions) CONDITION AT GROUND SURFACE: Indeterminate FUNCTIONAL INTERPRETATION: Petroglyphs AGE INTERPRETATION: Post-Contact and Possibly Pre-Contact DESCRIPTION: CSH 32 is in the northeastern portion of the Southern Impact Region. The site contains a large boulder measuring 1.7 m long by 1.2 m wide by 1.4 m high. Three faces of the boulder are exposed above the ground surface and come to a point. The boulder is marked with Zweng DEA Appendices Page 111 of 317Cultural Surveys Hawai'i Job Code: WAIKANE 5 Historic Properties Preservation Plan for the Reuse of Taro Loi along Waikne and Waikeekee Streams, on the property of the hulehule Forest Conservancy, Waikne Ahupuaa, Ko olaupoko District, TMK: (1) 4-8-014:005 and 4 -8-006:001 petroglyphs dating from early to modern post-Contact times, and possibly pre-Contact times. A variety of techniques have been used to mark this boulder including abrading, pecking and incising. Images include (a) an animal resembling a cat or dog produced by pecking; and (b) an animal resembling a sheep- or goat-like creature produced by abrading. Other motifs may possibly represent the form of waves. Clearly modern petroglyphs can also be deciphered: the word \"ARIZONA\" has been pecked and \"MISSISSIPPI 1961\" has been incised into the boulder. Both modern U.S. state names were inscribed over the sheep-like figure. The boulder also exhibits random scarring, likely incised by a metal blade. CSH 32 appears to be within SIHP #50-80-10 -4356, the extensive traditional Hawaiian site complex documented by Dunn et al. (1992) and Rasmussen (2008). It is important to state that the modified boulder with petroglyphs described here as CSH 32 is not the same feature as one identified by Rasmussen at this site (see photograph, Rasmussen 2008:98, of a distinctly different boulder). 3.2 Near Project Area Located near SIHP # -1078, the following two sites were originally recorded by Walker and Rosendahl (1990 ), but have since been reevaluated by Magnuson, Peterson and Carson (2004) and Rasmussen (2008), who recommended the sites be removed from the State Inventory of Historic Properties. 3.2.1 SIHP # : 50-80-10-4116 SITE TYPE: Historic ditch (1 Feature) TOPOGRAPHY: Located within and against the so uth bank of Waikne Stream VEGETATION: Predominately hau and strawberry guava CONDITION: Poor AGE: m by 0.75.0 m by 0.15-0.3 m DESCRIPTION: The ditch is constructed of concrete, waterworn basalt boulders, and wooden planks. The ditch generally contains a somewhat smooth interior surface of concrete reinforced with re-bar. The waterworn boulders are set into the concrete and line the exterior side of the ditch. The ditch follows the curves in the stream bank and appears to have functioned to divert water from the stream into adjacent flat soil areas. There are two remaining wooden planks lining the interior base and side of the ditch. Portions of the ditch have eroded away. (Walker and Rosendahl 1990) 3.2.2 SIHP # : 50-80-10-4117 SITE TYPE: Boulder alignment (1 Feature) TOPOGRAPHY: Located on the south side of the primary jeep road in Waikn e Valley VEGETATION: Predominately false staghorn fern CONDITION: Poor INTEGRITY: Unaltered Zweng of 317Cultural Surveys Hawai'i Job Code: WAIKANE 5 Historic Properties Preservation Plan for the Reuse of Taro Loi along Waikne and Waikeekee Streams, on the property of the hulehule Forest Conservancy, Waikne Ahupuaa, Ko olaupoko District, O'ahu Island 63 TMK: (1) 4-8-014:005 and 4 -8-006:001 PROBABLE AGE : Historic FUNCTIONAL INTERPRETATION: Transportation DIMENSIONS: 5.8 m by 0.3-0.5 m by 0.30-0.35 m DESCRIPTION: This structure is constructed of waterworn basalt boulders which are aligned along the south edge of a jeep road. The boulders are stacked one to two courses high and appear crudely faced on the south side. An erosion channel and high steep soi l bank are present immediately south of the boulder alignment. The site is probably a foundation remnant for the road leading to the back of Waikne Valley.

The comments on preservation treatment expressed by these individuals or organizations shall be considered when preparing the preservation plan. The plan shall include a list of individuals and organizations consulted and shall summarize their input. 4.2 Community Consultation Throughout the course of this plan preparation, an effort was made to contact and consult with Hawaiian cultural organizations, government agencies, and individuals who might have knowledge of and/or concerns about traditional cultural practices specifically related to the Project area. This effort was made by letter, email, telephone and in person contact. The initial outreach effort was started in September 2012, and is still underway. In the majority of cases, a letter (along with a map and an aerial photograph of the Project area ), were mailed with the following text: Aloha mai e kua, At the request of hulehule Forest Conservancy, LLC, Cultural Surveys Hawai 'i, Inc. (CSH) is preparing a preservation plan for ten (10) loi terraces and associated features identi fied along Waikne and Waikeekee streams on the property of the hulehule Forest Conservancy. These sites are identified as the Waikne Taro Flats (SIHP #: 50 -80-10-1078), and the Waikeekee loi (SIHP #: 50-80-10-4356). The project area is within boundaries TMKs [1] 4-8-014:005 and 4-8-006:001along the Waikne and Waikeekee Streams. This area is depicted on the U.S. Geological Survey 7.5-minute series topographic map, Kahana (1992) and Kaneohe (1998) Quadrangles, tax map and aerial photograph (Figure 1 to Figure 3). The project area is located on land privately owned by hulehule Forest Conservancy, LLC (OFC). The proposed project consists of the restoration and reuse of ancient and historic loi along the Waikne and Waikeekee Streams for kalo farming. The land on which the current project area rests was part of the Former Waikane Valley Training Area (FWVTA). This site is a Formerly Used Defense Site (FUDS) and has undergone the process of demilitarization. This entire training area was used by the Army and Marine Corps for training from 1942 to 1976.

The preservation plan will discuss the methods and procedures that will be used to restore and reuse the loi of two historic properties and also protect certain features of those sites which have been identified as having traditional cultural significance. SIHP #: 50-80 -10-1078 (Waikne Taro Flats) was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The site consists of seven terrace sets; associated agricultural features such as 'auwai; possible habitation features ; a charcoal kiln; and religious features including an agricultural shrine and a birthing stone. SIHP #: 50-80 -10-4356 (Waikeekee Loi) consists of five terrace sets and other agricultural features; a number of charcoal kilns, possible habitation areas and a boulder with historic petroglyphs. All of the planned work, including: removal of invasive plants such as large albizia trees; restoration of loi walls and 'auwai channels; and the preparation and planting of kalo in the loi will be done by hand or with hand-held tools. No heavy equipment/wheeled vehicles will be used off of the existing jeep road. PVC piping will be run through the 'auwai channels and up to the streams for irrigation, as opposed to altering the stream in any way. OFC is looking to secure permits to allow taro farming in the historic lo i and then have community groups become stewards of the taro lo i with a long term commitment. The purpose of this outreach is to gather information specific to the sites within the Project area and their component features, through contact with individuals that are knowledgeable about this area in order to assess potential impacts to the cultural resources, cultural practices and beliefs identified as a result of the planned Project. We are seeking your kkua (assistance) and guidance regarding the following aspects of our study: Knowledge of cultural sites which may be impacted by the restoration and reuse of loi within the Project area - for example, historic sites and / or archaeological sites. Recommendations for the treatment of known religious features within the sites, such as the agricultural shrine and birthing stone. Referrals of kpuna or elders and kama'ina who might be willing to share their cultural knowledge of the Project area. Any other cultural concerns the community might have related to Hawaiian cultural practices within or in the vicinity of the Project area.

It discusses buffer zones, short-term protection measures, and long-term preservation measures for each of the historic properties. Preservation measures for these historic properties will only be carried out on the portions of the h istoric properties within the hulehule Forest Conservancy , LLC property. The portions of the historic properties located on lands that are not owned by hulehule Forest Conservancy are not under the jurisdiction of this preservation plan. Hawaii Administrative Rules Title 13, Department of Land and Natural Resources Subtitle 13, State Historic Preservation Division Rules Chapter 277, states that a preservation plan prepared pursuant to chapters 13-275 or 13 -284, shall: (1) Identify for each significant historic property which forms of preservation will be implemented: avoidance and protection (conservation), stabilization, rehabilitation, restoration, reconstruction, interpretation, or appropriate cultural use; (2) Specify the buffer zones around each significant historic property and depict them on a map of sufficient scale; (3) Specify short-term protection measures for each significant historic property that will be within or near a construction area; (4)Discuss the agency or person's consultation process for historic properties deemed significant under paragraphs 13-275 -6(b)(5) or 13-284 -6(b)(5). The agency or person shall consult with ethnic organizations and individuals for whom the historic properties are of significance. The comments on preservation treatment expressed by these individuals or organizations shall be considered when preparing the preservation plan. The plan shall include a list of individuals and organizations consulted, and shall summarize their input. (see section 4.1 above) (5) Specify the long term preservation measures to be undertaken at each significant historic property. 5.1 Short -term Protectio n Measures Preservation will take three forms, (1) avoidance and protection (conservation), (2) restoration, and (3) appropriate cultural use. 5.1.1 Identification of Historic Properties and Demarcation of Short-Term Buffer Zone Prior to any land disturbing activities or vegetation clearance in the vicinity of any historic properties designated for restoration, archaeologists will identify and clearly mark with bright colored flagging tape all archaeological features to be avoided; this includes any features interpreted as having a non-agricultural purpose ( Figure 18 and Figure 19 ). After the establishment of a 5 meter buffer zone around the features, all flagging tape marking the features Zweng DEA Appendices Page 119 of 317Cultural Surveys Hawai'i Job Code: WAIKANE 5 Proposed Preservation Measures Preservation Plan for the Reuse of Taro Loi along Waikne and Waikeekee Streams, on the property of the hulehule Forest Conservancy, Waikne Ahupuaa, Ko olaupoko District, O'ahu Island 70 TMK: (1) 4-8-014:005 and 4 -8-006:001 themselves will be removed. After land disturbing activities are completed, the buffer zone flagging around the features will be removed. 5.1.2 A lbizia removal Large albizia (Falcataria moluccana or Moluccan albizia) trees are present within the project area which will need to be removed in order to reuse the loi. Albizia trees are native to Indonesia and were introduce to Hawaii by Joseph Rock in 1917 (Little and Skolmen 2003:1 ) and have become extremely invasive. B ecause they \"f ix nitrogen in the soil, they alter Hawaiian forests to favor non- native plants.\" (Wianecki 2010 -2011:1) The albizia trees cannot be taken down using machinery or heavy equipment for fear of disturbing the loi sites. Instead, they will be poisoned using an approved herbicide called Garlon 4 Ultra; the active ingredient is Triclopyr, which is unrestricted and selective against dicots (Motooka et al. 1999:4). This will be accomplished through cut- surface stem treatment which has \"virtually no hazard of non target plant injury\" (Motooka et al. 1999:2): first, the drilling 1/4-inch diameter holes, approximately 1-inch deep and 8-inches apart along the circumference of the tree, near the base of the tree trunks (approximately 1 to 3 ft above ground level); second, each hole will be injected with 0.5 ml of Garlon 4 Ultra. The trees should drop their leaves within a month and small branches in 6-9 months. It is expected that it will take 4 -6 years before the trees have degraded to the point whereby only the trunks remain standing. For safety reasons, workers will be kept out of the loi, and other areas that are directly below the branches of each albizia tree, until the branches have fallen and have been removed.

The location of SIHP# 50-80 -06-1078 and -4356, in low traffic or remote areas on private property, serves to adequately restrict unwanted access. Each historic property recommended for preservation, and corresponding buffer zones will be accurately located by a licensed land surveyor and this information will be documented on appropriate land records and maps. 5.2.2 Vegetation Clearing Methods All vegetation clearing on and around the individual archaeological features will be done by hand or with hand-held tools. Periodic checks will be made at the sites to check that vegetation such as weeds, shrubs, or trees are damaging the integrity or stability of the sites. If vegetation is damaging the sites, all vegetation clearance will be monitored by an archaeologist. Allowable hand tools include, but are not restricted to: chain saws, machetes, weed-eaters, and clippers. Herbicides may be used prior to manual clearing in order to minimize the volume of vegetation to be removed, but environmental impacts should be considered. It should be emphasized that during vegetation clearing, care should be exercised to avoid any disturbance to the historic properties. No on-site or adjacent burning will be allowed. Wheeled vehicles will not be used within the buffer zone boundaries of the archaeological avoidance areas or off-road in the project areas. 5.2.3 Restoration and planting of loi Starti ng with Waikne Terrace Set 2 (due to ease of access), and continuing one set at a time, the loi will gradually be brought back into working order. The work of restoring, planting and farming the loi will be carried out by hand or using hand tools and in a traditional manner as detailed in Native Planters in Old Hawaii (Handy and Handy 1972). Relevant excerpts from that text follow: The Hawaiians recognized the value of green manure in enriching their taro soil. In preparing ground for planting, after it had lain fallow, they flooded the soil, softened it with the digging pole, then pulled up the grass and weeds and stamped them deep into the mud. The same thing was done at each weeding and when old leaves were stripped off the taro plants. When a piece of ground was exhausted (pahulu) , quantities of hau and kuku i branches and leaves were pressed into the mud and allowed to rot before final digging and leveling for planting. Animal or human manure, seaweed, or fish were never used as fertilizer. (89) The preferred method of wet-taro cultivation, wherever terrain and running water permitted, was in terraces (loi) irrigated from streams by means of carefully Zweng DEA Appendices Page 123 of 317Cultural Surveys Hawai'i Job Code: WAIKANE 5 Proposed Preservation Measures Preservation Plan for the Reuse of Taro Loi along Waikne and Waikeekee Streams, on the property of the hulehule Forest Conservancy, Waikn e Ahupuaa, Koolaupoko District, O'ahu Island 74 TMK: (1) 4-8-014:005 and 4 -8-006:001 engineered ditch systems. In small loi the water flows from one terrace into the next below [...] the lower loi must depend entirely on overflow and percolation from the higher. The area of the several terraces is small, however, so that the freshness and coolness of the water is not exhausted as it is in the broad patches of the lowlands. (92) The new piece of land selected for making a terrace was flooded for several days, until the earth was thoroughly water-soaked. The dimensions, shape, and required degree of terracing were determined by the contour of the land. As described by Kamakau (n.d., Barr\u00e8re, ed.) the men with their oo (digging sticks) lined up inside the limits of the banks of the projected terrace. Throwing up the earth along the line of the proposed embankment, they dug down until they struck firm subsoil. Sometimes little stakes (laolao ) were put down to hold the bank. After the soil had thus been piled on the banks to the required level, the sides of the embankment facing the water were stamped down with the feet, and edges and lines were straightened. Sugar-cane leaves were then beaten into the surface of these inner faces of the banks with logs (laau) or the butts of coconut leaves (kuau) . Coconut leaves were then laid on the surface and pounded in with large flat stones. On this, moist earth was laid and pounded until the surface was smooth; finally the bank was covered with fine soil, on top of which were put trash and leaves to prevent the new bank from drying and cracking in the sun. This completed the making of the earth bank for low terraces in valley bottoms. Some earth banks were reinforced inside by veneering with stones. (92-93) When a high terrace was built to offset a steep slope, [...] a stone retaining wall had to be constructed. This required digging away top soil at the base line of the wall until the bottom stones could be laid in firm subsoil. This top soil was thrown up on the slope above the excavation to serve as fill for the terrace. For the foundation, the largest stones that could be handled, available on the hillside, in a stream bed, or on the beach, were pried, rolled, and slid into place. Some stones so used weighed tons. The wall sloped slightly inward toward the top so as to increase stability. [...] In these terraces, after the retaining wall had been completed, the hillside at the back of the enclosed area was dug away to complete the fill. (93) As the first step in building up a new terrace, it was necessary to make a hard floor so that there might be a minimum of seepage of the precious irrigating water. It is said that anciently the bottom of a terrace was pounded with logs and heavy stones. This work was termed paluku or pakui. But the usual method, followed until recent times, was \"treading\" (hehi). (93) Kamakau (n.d., Barr\u00e8re, ed. ) described a \" day of treading (la hehi lo i),\" which we summarize here. The patch was filled with water. Men, women, and children, bedecked with greenery, waded in and vigorously tramped the bottom soil of the patch to make it firm and watertight, \"dancing, rejoicing, shouting, panting and making sport.\" The owner of the patch had meanwhile prepared for all the folk taking part a feast of fish, pork, and poi, in which they indulged after the treading. The huli were planted the next day. The banks (kuauna, ika, kaika, or kuaio) of the Zweng DEA 124 of 317Cultural Surveys Hawai'i Job Code: WAIKANE 5 Proposed Preservation Measures Preservation Plan for the Reuse of Taro Loi along Waikne and Waikeekee Streams, on the property of the hulehule Forest Conservancy, Waikn e Ahupuaa, Koolaupoko District, O'ahu TMK: (1) 4-8-014:005 and 4 -8-006:001 old terraces were not the mere grass- covered retaining walls and footpaths that they are today. On the banks the wet-taro farmers planted important subsidiary crops: bananas, sugar cane, arrowroot, and ti plants, the leaves of which had many uses and the roots of which appeased hunger in famine times. Kamakau says that the old planters took great pride in the planting of their banks. (93-94) The natives used to fertilize their terraces by burying in the ground the foliage and branches of hau or kuku i and allowing these to rot thoroughly before planting the cuttings. Present-day planters also throw back into the patch all the stalks and leaves from the cuttings. While the taro is growing they throw out grass and most weeds, but stamp into the mud certain weeds that are regarded as desirable fertilizers, particularly the koheko he which grows abundantly in wet patches. (95) For taro to thrive, the water should be both fresh and cool, one reason why loi in the upper reaches of cool, deep valleys are especially good for taro culture. (95) Not only did the flooded terraces raise the staple of life for the old planter, while its banks supported his secondary crops, but in the semiliquid slime of the patch itself fish were raised. Fish may still be seen in some loi today. Kamakau writes that the varieties of fish bred in the loi were the awa , mullet, oopu and aholehole. (94) In areas of wet-taro cultivation, young mullet were placed in the liquid mud of taro patches and there thrived. It is not unlikely that this latter custom came about as a re sult of placing the smaller fish in the loi when a netful was caught, in order to keep them fresh. It was discovered that they not only kept fresh, but thrived and grew. The mullet (ama ama) is a grazing fish, and when the fingerlings (pua ama) were put into loi their stirring about and grazing helped keep the water fresh. (262) OFC is currently seeking a community organization of some kind to take on the long term care and harvest of kalo in the loi. 5.2.4 Stabilization Measures Other than the restoration of loi walls and auwai channels, no stabilization measures are anticipated in the immediate future for any of the historic properties addressed in this preservation plan. No structures were observed to be in danger of collapse or other disturbance by human or natural causes. Any future stabilization of these sites would be restricted to repairing walls and facings in areas where rocks have been displaced, with repair work limited to returning sites to their condition as documented during recent archaeological studies. The work would be performed by persons experienced in traditional Hawaiian dry-stack rock wall building, and in consultation with SHPD/DLNR. 5.2.5 Landscaping Plan Other than the planting of kalo in the loi, no landscaping is planned for any of the archaeological preserve areas addressed in this preservation plan. However, if landscaping outside the loi areas is to occur in the future, the following landscaping provisions are recommended: Zweng DEA Appendices Page 125 of 317Cultural Surveys Hawai'i Job Code: WAIKANE 5 Proposed Preservation Measures Preservation Plan for the Reuse of Taro Loi along Waikne and Waikeekee Streams, on the property of the hulehule Forest Conservancy, Waikn e Ahupuaa, Koolaupoko District, O'ahu Island 76 TMK: (1) a. Use of ti (Cordyline fruticosa) Polynesian arrowroot (Tacca leontopetaloides ); all of which are mentioned by Handy and Handy 1972 as important subsidiary crops which were planted on loi banks or nearby. b. Minimal ground alteration during landscaping activities outside of the loi, in order to maintain the integrity of the historic properties. c. Vegetation adjacent to historic properties should not include varieties that contain large and ground disturbing root systems, large overhanging branches, or which are so overbearing as to destroy or overrun structural elements of the historic properties. 5.2.6 Pathways, Lighting, and Other Hardscape Structures At present there is no plan for specific hardscape construction, pathways, or lighting within any of the archaeological preserve or restoration areas. No benches or lighting, drawing particular attention to the areas, is indicated. Future pathways, benches, and/or lighting would be allowed within the restoration areas as long as they do not involve adverse impact to the integrity of the historic properties. Any future plans for hardscape construction within the archaeological preserve areas should be made in consultation with SHPD/DLNR. 5.2.7 Access to Historic Properties There are currently no plans to allow public access to the sites. The hulehule Forest Conservancy (OFC) ground can only be accessed by crossing private lands held by the City and County of Honolulu (CCH; managed by the Windward Dept. of Park and Recreation). The OFC has an easement to travel over the Waik ne Valley Road w hich crosses the CCH parcel to reach the loi areas. Therefore, only a limited number of people involved in the project and cleared by OFC will have the ability to use the Waik ne Valley Road. Access to the historic properties will also be allowed for SHPD/DLNR staff to inspect the archaeological preserve and restoration areas to assure compliance with the provisions of this preservation plan. Access will be allowed only with prior written consent of the landowner or representatives. Access to the archaeological preserve areas prior to and during implementation of this preservation plan can be obtained by contacting the current landowner hulehule Forest Conservancy, via the following contact information: hulehule Forest Paul Zweng 5.2.8 Future Archaeological Research There are currently no plans for further archaeological work on the historic properties covered by this preservation plan. If any future archaeological research is expected, no work should be allowed without prior written approval of a research plan by the SHPD/DLNR and only in coordination with the current landowner.

His family is a kuleana landowner, receiving title to the land during the Great M\u00e4hele . The family migrated from Waik\u00e4ne to Hakipu'u in the time of Kamehameha I. Mr. Fukumitsu has been active in the community with a focus on agriculture and Native Hawaiian subjects for many years. He was a founder of the Native Hawaiian legal corporation, and used to be very active in the area's Neighborhood Boards. He currently serves on the Governor's \"Taro Purity and Security Task Force\" that has been monitoring taro lands, harvests and where taro is going for the past three years. The Task Force introduces bills to the legislature that call for more support of taro growing through loans, land, etc. He has been busy with the Task Force, which is currently preparing for the opening of the next legislative session. Regarding the proposed cacao farm, Mr. Fukumitsu commented that removal of vegetation may cause runoff that would impact water quality in the streams, shore areas and ocean. Sediment running off the land can smother limu, o'opu, and other native aquatic species as well as coral reefs. The ho'iwa i (river mouth area) is important because many species conceive there. Species like hi'iwai and opae lay eggs in the sand. Ocean species like mullet, moi and awa come to the muliwai , where their hormones are activated by sweet (brackish) water and they reproduce. Land clearing can also result in the loss of topsoil. There needs to be a good vegetated buffer zone between the cleared land and the stream, which can be accomplished by planting from the bottom up. This practice was followed in traditional taro planting. He agreed that the '\u00d6hulehule Forest Conservancy's plans to plant cover crops, use mulch and avoid land clearing during the rainy season would help to mitigate the impacts of soil runoff. Mr. Fukumitsu has done extensive research on the history of the area, and has documents from the Great M\u00e4hele , population counts, Land Commission awards and court awards from the approximate time period of 1850-1920. He is interested in preserving the ahupua'a, with particular emphasis on native crops. He believes that cacao is compatible with native crops, since it is environmentally sound and has good economic potential. Taro is culturally and educationally important, but labor-intensive. There is economic possibility there, but it needs to be an agricultural operation, a business. In the olden days taro was a dietary staple and an industrial crop with significance throughout Hawai'i and the Pacific. We need to prove to future generations that taro can be grown again. Zweng DEA Appendices Page 134 of 317Cultural Impact Interview Summaries Page 2 Other good crops that could be grown in Waik\u00e4ne are ulu, tapioca, banana and ' uala. These crops provide good, healthy sustenance. Awa, which is drunk as a religious and spiritual practice, has good potential pharmaceutically and its consumption is popular. Native and non-native plants could be grown together, as part of an educational and cultural program. Mr. Fukumitsu used to volunteer cultivating taro 25-30 years ago on the Kamaka family kuleana parcel up in the valley. They would clean the land, propagate native species, and also hike on trails to hunt and gather mountain apples. Those lands were condemned by the Federal government to serve as military training grounds until 9/11. The government hasn't made an attempt to clean up that part of the valley, only the lower areas. Hakipu'u and Waik\u00e4 ne valley were very sacred places that the king gave to the kahuna. This area is where the first voyagers from the Pacific landed, so it holds the significance of what they brought on the voyage in their canoes. La'au lapa'au (medicinal plants) and trees were some of the plants they brought from across the Pacific. Each site signified an individual and his trade, with trades going from mountain to ocean. For example, Ka'ai b rought ulu to Kualoa. Mauiloa is buried between Waik\u00e4ne and Hakipu'u. The history here goes back 25,000 years. In the modern day, as we put these pieces together, it becomes a more significant reality, a real history. History represents a way of life that is being modernized and Westernized. They started using animals like buffalo and oxen to pull carts. It was sophisticated living, even in grass shacks, pounding poi. Then came cars. Now we're trying to integrate tradition with modern life. Mr. Fukumitsu wants to plant taro in a makai part of Waik\u00e4ne, and has been working with the City and WWCA to move forward. He could use support to make it happen and sustain it. He is also interested in being part of Mr. Zweng's project, and welcomes future contact from the '\u00d6hulehule Forest Conservancy. He helped create the lo'i at University of Hawai 'i and a number of other places. He identified Mr. Francis Sinenci as a good contact regarding the process and permits required for building a traditional hale. Also, Cultural Surveys Hawaii did a nice report on Hakipu'u. Mr. Fukumitsu consented to allow Townscape Inc. to include the contents of this interview in the '\u00d6hulehule Forest Conservancy planning documents, including th e Cacao Farm Environmental Assessment. Zweng DEA Appendices Page 135 of 317Cultural Impact Interview Summaries Page 3 2.Pat Royos Interview Summary Interviewee: Mrs. Pat Royos (Waik\u00e4ne Valley resident and member of Wai\u00e4hole-Waik\u00e4ne Community Association) Interviewed by: Lauren Armstrong (Townscape, Inc.) by phone Date: December 6, 2012 Mrs. Pat Royos was born in Wai\u00e4hole Valley in 1945, was raised there and continues to live in the valley today. She has served as president of the Wai\u00e4hole-Waik\u00e4ne Community Association (WWCA) and is currently an active member. Her parents came to Wai\u00e4hole Valley in 1932, after her father lost his leg while working at the quarry in Waim\u00e4nalo. Their family farmed banana and papaya on a seven-acre lot. There were many taro lo'i in those days. Mrs. Royos is very interested in preserving the Waik\u00e4ne pier because it has a legacy and historic significance of more than 100 years. Ships used to pick up crops grown in Wai\u00e4hole and Waik\u00e4ne valleys, such as coffee, sugarcane, rice, and pineapple. There was a train track that carried food from up in the valley down to the pier. She would like the valley to go back to that, but we need serious farmers who want to farm. Nowadays young people are more interested in working indoors on computers. The number of cultivated taro patches began to decline in the 1960's. Now there are people like the Reppuns and a lady named Dolores on Homestead Road who still grow taro. Dolores and her husband used to grow 12 acres of taro, but since her husband passed away, she and a worker from Bishop are growing less. There are many people who want to grow taro, but it's hard to get in because the City and State own most of the land. The State wants to get rid of this place, because they're all about development a nd have lost interest in agriculture. The agricultural park could have been successful, but all the old-timers who knew how to farm are fading away. Under the long- term lease, people's land goes back to the State if no one wants to take care of it. The HHFDC requires lessees to generate a good income from farming, not from what they do outside. Before, people didn't know it would come to this. They t hought they could do what they wanted with the land. Now the State tells them what to grow, and doesn't allow them to raise animals. Farmers must grow things like vegetables, flowers and taro \u2014the focus is on production. If we want more taro, we need mor e water. That's the only way to bring the water back, because the lo'i need water. It used to be 50-50 leeward and windward, now looking at our stagnant streams, it seems that 75% is going to the leeward side. It's not fair. Since sugar plantations ar e done, they should return the water to us. Once you give them something, they won't give it back. Now they want the water for development. Other crops aside from taro would also help get the water back. We need serious farming, otherwise the land goes back to the State. Mrs. Royos and the WWCA support Mr. Zweng's plans to start a cacao farm, because they would rather see farming than development. The last guy who Zweng DEA Appendices Page 136 of 317Cultural Impact Interview Summaries Page 4 owned that property (Mr. Enomoto) wanted to develop it, and put in an eight-inch water line. The HHFDC wanted it, but someone in the valley found out and the community protested. She believes Mr. Zweng is different from the previous landowner. He is involved in the community, and they see him every weekend. He is going through the process, showed them (the WWCA) the proposal, and they trust him. Seeing what he's doing, they support it. Mrs. Royos would like to see farming come back. The community won't let HHFCD sell the land, and will keep fighting. The BWS is not wanted in the valley, since the existing contractor has done fine. BWS wants our water, not to take care of people. This residential community is different from outside. It' s agriculture and residential, with different water pricing for farmers. The people who live here and work the land stick together. She is glad her son- in-law (Elijah Kane, a house builder) is getting involved in cultural practices in the valley, since the next generation needs to be involved. They want to save Waik\u00e4ne pier for its historic value and the mauka-makai connections it could foster. The pier is collapsing, but the DLNR doesn't have money to rebuild or restore it. Also, many people in the community would like to have an open market in the Wai\u00e4hole-Waik\u00e4ne Park that is currently cleaned by the WWVCA. This would encourage more farming since farmers would have a place to sell on Wednesdays and Fridays. Restrooms and parking facilities are needed to have an open market. The City has money to do this, and Donovan Dela Cruz tried really hard to make it happen. The steering committee decided not to due to concerns about homeless people living in the park. Mrs. Royos thinks that people living nearby could take care of the park so that doesn't happen, and thinks it could be a beautiful park. Another cultural project she and others would like to make happen in Waik\u00e4ne is to make a canoe for the kids. They could use albizia trees from the valley, just like the olden days. The kids could learn how to make the canoe, and this would be a linkage to the pier. The kids could paddle canoe. Also, Mrs. Royos' son- in-law wants to save the fish by making them an area to lay eggs. They would need netting and more freshwater from the streams to create the right habitat for aholehole fish (mullet), crabs and limu. They also want to clean the area near the poi factory, and to see beautiful scenery with plenty of lo'i. Anything can happen with willpower, then people want to get involved. Some people are interested in farming taro with buffalo. Mr. Keoki Fukumitsu of Hakipu'u/ Waik\u00e4ne is interested in growing taro in Waik\u00e4ne. Mrs. Royos consented to allow Townscape Inc. to include all contents of this interview in the '\u00d6hulehule Forest Conservancy planning documents, including the Cacao Farm Environmental Assessment. Zweng DEA Appendices Page 137 of 317Cultural Impact Interview Summaries Page 5 3.Ted Saizon Interview Summary Interviewee: Mr. Ted Saizon (Waik\u00e4ne Valley resident) Interviewed by: Lauren Armstrong (Townscape, Inc.) by phone Date: December 12, 2012 Mr. Ted Saizon has lived on Wai\u00e4hole Valley Rd. near the entrance to the proposed cacao farm for 20 years. Before Waik\u00e4ne Valley his family lived in nearby Kahalu'u . His family has been in Kahalu'u since the 1800's, and many of Mr. Saizon's relatives sti ll live on the peninsula behind the fishpond. He attended school in Wai\u00e4hole Valley, and remembers the valley was mostly in farming then as it is now. Now, more people live in the valley. Way back, there used to be cattle in the valley. The proposed cac ao farm would be good because it's all farming in the area. Mr. Zweng is involved in the community, and lets people know about his plans. He loves nature, and goes hiking all over the property. Not many people hike up in the valley. Most of it is protected watershed area. Some people go pig hunting and bike riding. Old families sometimes go into the forest to get bamboo for decoration and garden trellises. Some people also gather edible fern shoots from the forest. There is a Tongan family up Wai\u00e4hole Valley Road that runs a farming and cultural learning center. Aside from that, the valley is peaceful. The government closed off the backside of the valley where the Kamakas used to be because it was a former military training area. Before that, the Kamakas used that land for a long time. They used to have lo'i way up in the valley. Most of the Kamaka family now lives near Kam Highway. Mr. Saizon takes care of his five grandchildren who live with him. He is thankful that they have a place to stay for a while, but is unsure what will happen in the future. Zweng DEA Appendices Page 138 of 317ZWENG S INGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE IN WAIHOLE, KOOLAUPOKO, OAHU KAMAINA INFORMANT MEMORANDUM NO. 01 Date: Tuesday, 29, 2020 To: Project Files From: Townscape, Inc. RE: Proposed Zweng EW: The iew took place in- person at Mr. Laurence Uyemura's home in Waihole Valley. Lillie provided a brief introduction to Townscape, Inc. (TSI) and its work on planning projects for the hulehule Forest Conservancy and specifically the current Conservation District Use Application and Environmental Assessment report for the Proposed Zweng Single Family Residence in Waihole, Koolaupoko, Oahu. The discussion included bo th broad concepts and considerations for planning within the ahpuaa of Waihole and Waikne, and specific issues and suggestions for the potential for cultural and/or historic impacts from the construction of the Proposed residence in the project area. When asked i f he was familiar with the project site, Mr. Uyemura shared the following: Mr. Uyemura has visited the parcel and walked the project site with Paul Zweng. In his youth, he spent time in the area, and he remembers the parcel from when the Saizonfamily lived there and had a house, chicken farm and plant nursery. When asked t o share any cultural or historical knowledge that he has about the area, Mr. Uyemura shared the following: Hakipuu and Waikne were known more for their religious history. There is a spiritual place in Waikne near where the Kamaka family property was, which is along Waikne Ridge in the back of the valley . On the backside of Waikne Mountain, near the two red hills there is a rock face on theridge and just below that there was a stream that came out of the ground there. Thisspring had a pipeline that was connected to it to provide water to the people in Waikne. There are some Hawaiian sites near Mhoe Collins property in Waihole Valley . There is a heiau in Hakipuu, called Puakea, that was used for human sacrifices. The Cano family house used to be a plantation house. In the early 1900's, there were alot of Asian people who were brought in to work in the plantations, mostly Okinawansand Japanese. There were other plantation houses throughout the valley too. Zweng DEA Appendices Page 139 of 317The military came into the area after the attack on Pearl Harbor and used the area as a military base and kept ammunition there. Mr. Uyemura isn't familiar with any Hawaiians that did worshipping in Waihole Valley. When asked t o share his personal connection to the area, including the project site, shared the following: Mr. Uyemura 's family is from Hakipuu, which is north of Waihole and Waikne. His mother's family is descended from Inoino, a kuleana landow ner from the time of the Mhele that had kuleana lands in Hakipuu near what is now called Johnson Road. Mr. Uyemura 's Grandfather, Mitsutani Uyemura, was Japanese and lived in Hakipuu. His father Stanley Uyemura and grandfather later ran a fishing company with a fish house that was based in Waikne. They kept their boats at the shoreline and had Filipino workers that were employed in their fishing business. Fish were caught by lay net fishing between Kualoa and Kneohe Bay and then sold locally. Mr. Uyemura remembers helping with the fishing business when he was young. His family moved out of Hakipuu to Waikne around the time of WWII. The military builta runway and air base at Kualoa, and that kind of moved out the people from there and moved out the Hawaiians in the area. Mr. Uyemura 's father later worked as a carpenter at the military base. He later got into working as a mechanic and was very akamai. He later worked as a driver for a gascompany delivering gas. Mr. Uyemura 's mother was the first bus driver in the area, during the 1950's -1960's. She drove a route from Waihole to Kneohe and dropped off kids from Waihole Elementary to Ben Parker Elementary, servicing multiple schoolsalong the windward side. When Mr. Uyemura was younger, he would go into the military areas on Fridays after the military personnel left for the week. He would go around the military area, and wouldsometimes get the canned rations that were left around. One day, in the 1960's, Mr. Uyemura heard a loud noise and there was a huge landslide that came down from Waikne Ridge and filled in the aquaponds that were at the base of the hill over therethat was operated by the Robert's family. Maybe it was the spring that eroded the side ofthe mountain and caused the landslide. When asked t o describe any traditional or customary practices that he is aware of in the area, Mr. Uyemura shared the following: He knows that taro and rice was grown on the makai side of the Kamehameha Highwayin Waihole, across from the Poi Factory. There were many farmers in the valley that grew kalo. The area where the Reppun family lives is where there was mostly kalo along thestreams.There were a lot of loi in the area, most of them were smaller kine, not big kine. Plentywere located in the mauka areas of the vall eys, like mauka of the Kupau and Wilkinson properties on Waihole Valley North Bend Road, passed Paul Zweng's property and at Zweng DEA Appendices Page 140 of 317the end of the road. There were also a lot of loi in Waikne as well, along the streams there. When asked i f there are any long- time residents of the valley who may be familiar with traditional and customary practices, Mr. Uyemura shared the following: Mhoe Collins family has been in the valley for a long time. Toni Cano's family has been in the valley for a long time. The Fukumitsu's and the Hoe's, relatives of Mr. Uyemura 's, have also been in the valley for a long time. The Kupau family is a newer family to the valley. McCandless quiet titled and stole land from the people in the area. He put his name on alot of the land papers, and that is how he got a lot of Hawaiians out of the area. Themilitary also got Hawaiians out of the area too. That's part of why there aren't as manyHawaiian families that are still here. When asked i f there are any persons that he knows of who may need access to the property for traditional or customary practices, Mr. Uyemura shared the following: Before, there used to be Pig Hunters that would go up into the mountain to hunt. Before,they could go up there and hunt. When Oahu Sugar Company took over the land, then itwas harder for hunters to have access up there to hunt so now there aren't as many. When it comes to gathering rights, the only trees that he is aware of from the area that would be good for gathering is sandalwood, but most of that is gone. The trees that are there now, Albizia, Red Guav a, Octopus Tree, Fiddlewood, and Gunpowder Tree, these are trees that no one is going to gather from. There isn't a lot of need to gather fromthese trees in the area. There used to be more surface water resources in the area of Paul Zweng's property.Once the McCandless water line and the Water System (Waihole Valley Water System)were put in, there is much less surface water. Something happened back when they put in the McCandless line, and it drained the surface water. In the 1960's there was onlythe McCandless line and there was more water back then. Today, there is barely atrickle of water. There isn't anyone in particular that Mr. Uyemura knows of that would need access to the property for farming or gathering or other traditional practices.

Lillie provided a brief introduction to Townscape, Inc. (TSI) and its work on planning projects for the hulehule Forest Conservancy and specifically the current Conservation District Use Application and Environmental Assessment report for the Proposed Zweng Single Family Residence in Waihole, Koolaupoko, Oahu. The discussion included both broad concepts and considerations for planning within the ahu puaa of Waihole and Waikne, and specific issues and suggestions for the potential for cultural and/or historic impacts from the construction of the proposed residence in the project area. W hen asked if he was familiar with the project site, Mr. Saizon shared the following: Mr. Saizon first became familiar with the property because he was looking for a place tokeep his horses. He had recently come into ownership of two quarter horses and waslooking for a suitable place to keep them. He was aware of old horse stables built on the property, then owned by Tom Enomoto. Mr. Saizon reached out to Mr. Enomoto, andthey reached an agreement for him to be able to keep his horses on the property. At this time Mr. Saizon was living with his family in Kahaluu. Over time, he and his wife considered moving into the home that was on the property as well. He reached an agr eement with Mr. Enomoto and moved into the residence that was on the property around 1991 (this structure was later removed in 2017). The previous owner, before Mr. Enomoto used to keep horses on the property, and als o us ed to have a farming operation growing tropical plants like ginger and heliconia. When Mr. Saizon and his family moved onto the property they grew some tropical plants,they raised chickens, and kept horses. W hen asked to share any cultural or historical knowledge that he has about the area, Mr. Saizon shared the following: Mr. Saizon used to ride his horses throughout Waihole and Waikne Valleys. He is ver y f amiliar with the trails and the land in those valleys. He mentioned that the back part of Zweng DEA Appendices Page 144 of 317the valley was used by the military and was fenced off because of the unexploded ordinance. Mr. Saizon was able to access parts of this area while riding. Mr. Saizon said that he would sometimes come across areas with rock walls andterraces. None of these areas were located in the vicinity of the proposed residence. Allof these places were some distance from the property that he was a tenant of . Mr. Saizon said that he is not aware of any historical or cultural sites near the proposedresidence. He mentioned that there were some flat areas at the back of the horse stables that could have been used for kalo at one time. But there was never any k alo grown there that he had ever seen. There was not much water available on the property,only a small trickle of water in the area behind the old horse stables. Mr. Saizonmentioned that by looking at the land it appears that there may have been more wat er before, but all of that had dried up by the time that he resided on the property. When asked to describe any traditional or customary practices that he is aware of in the area, Mr. Saizon shared the following: Mr. Saizon mentioned that there is a water source nearby, the stream (Waianu Stream)that is located closer to Waihole Valley Road. He mentioned that there were kalofarmers along that stream, and in the valley in general, located further upstream by theReppuns, and further down closer to the ocean too. He also mentioned that there was a Tongan family that lived on the property adjacent tothe Zweng property, and that family grew ulu or breadfruit. Mr. Saizon said that he is not aware of any cultural uses like kalo farming or gathering ofspecific plants or items on the property. In the 20+ years that he resided on the propertyhe never had anyone ask for permission to access any parts of the property for culturaluses. When asked if there are any long- time residents of the valley who may be familiar with traditional and customary practices, Mr. Saizon shared the following: Norman Sadoyama is a long- time resident in the Valley and would be familiar with the property. Laurence Uyemura is a long- time resident in the Valley and would be familiar with the property and maybe cultural practices in the Valley. When asked if there are any persons that he knows of who may need access to the property for traditional or customary practices, Mr. Saizon shared the following: Mr. Saizon said that there are a lot of pig hunters in the Valley. People who wanted to access the property in order to hunt in the Valley needed to ask his permission. Thehunters that went on the property were mostly friends of his that became aware of the property through their relationship with him. He would allow his friends to hunt on the property. He is not familiar with any persons or families who every needed access to theproperty for hunting. Mr. Saizon said most of the hunters that he allowed on the propertyhad not hunted on the property prior to him allowing them on the site. Zweng DEA Appendices Page 145 of 317Mr. Saizon stated that no persons or families ever asked for permission to access t he pr operty for traditional or customary practices such as gathering or caring for grave sites, etc. Zweng DEA Appendices Page 146 of 317APPENDIX G: Ka W ai Ola April 2021 Issue (OHA 2021 ) Public Notice for Environmental Assessment in Waihole Valley, Ko'olaupoko, O'ahu page 169 of 31 7 Zweng DEA Appendices Page 147 of 317Apelila (April ) 2021 | Vol. 38, No. 04 A Place of Chiefs The evening sun sets behind the Wai'anae mountains streaming golden light to K\u00fckaniloko.

All rights reserved. My mother was a lauhala weaver and, growing up, I would often watch her work. As I reflect now upon that process - from collecting and preparing the leaves, to designing and weaving each piece - what stands out in my mind was her intentionality. Mom was intentional about every piece she made. She thought about its purpose, and considered its user. She crafted each item envisioning the finished product being used by the person for whom it was intended and, in doing so, endowed each piece with her aloha and her mana. OHA's new strategic plan, Mana i Mauli Ola (Strength to Wellbeing), presented for the first time in this issue of Ka Wai Ola , was created with that same kind of intentional - ity and purpose with the needs of our l\u00e4hui as our greatest consideration. A summary of the 15-year plan, enlivened with artwork by Nelson Makua, is included here as a special insert. OHA's three foundations - 'Ohana, Mo'omeheu and '\u00c4ina - and our four directions - Educational Pathways, Quality Housing, Health Outcomes and Economic Stability - represent the intentionality of our work for the betterment of our l\u00e4hui. Implementation of OHA's new strategic plan has begun and additional details will be shared in future issues of Ka Wai Ola, and on our website. Also noteworthy, our cover story this month provides a preview of OHA's Concep - tual Master Plan (CMP) for OHA's 511 acres in Wahiaw\u00e4 that surround K\u00fckaniloko. Read about the history of the area and our planning process to learn more about OHA's approach to land management and stewardship. OHA's plans for these Wahiaw\u00e4 lands are intentional, purposeful and designed with our l\u00e4hui at the forefront. In keeping with this theme of intentionality, this month OHA celebrates the 10-year anniversary of the Papakilo Database. With a vision to be \"the database of databases,\" Papakilo has more than 65 unique collections and over a million records, and houses an extensive array of k\u00fcpuna 'ike including M\u00e4hele records, Hawaiian language news - papers and other high-value resources to meet the research needs of our l\u00e4hui and to consolidate, store and protect this irreplaceable 'ike. Be on the lookout for future webi - nars that will introduce new users to this hidden gem and provide site navigation tips. Finally, on the subject of intentions, I am reminded that not all intentions are good.Last month OHA was excited about a bill in the state Senate that would remove resi - dential prohibitions on OHA's land at Kaka'ako Makai, allowing OHA to help address O'ahu's housing shortage while generating millions of dollars to expand our programs to benefit Hawaiians. The bill passed in the Senate by an overwhelming major - ity, only to die six days later in the House without a hearing. My disappointment that the bill did not even get a fair hearing is overshadowed by my disappointment in the politicization of our self-determination. Regardless, we must draw upon the resilience of our k\u00fcpuna and resolve to ourselves to be pono with our kumu - our intentions and purposes - even if others are not. Sylvia M. Hussey, Ed.D.

OHA has committed $250,000 to a Native Hawaiian Teacher Education and Professional Development grant designed to increase teacher recruitment and retention in Hawaiian immersion and Hawaiian-focused public charter schools, and $500,000 to its K\u00fclia grant program designed to improve the lives of Native Hawaiian individuals, families and communities in alignment with OHA's strategic plan priorities. Applications are being solicited from nonprofit organizations that administer community-based projects designed to strengthen Hawaiian benefi - ciaries, families, and communities. The deadline to apply is April 16, 2021. Earlier in March, OHA committed $1.67 mil- lion to a COVID-19 Response Grant to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Native Hawaiian 'ohana and communities and $1.25 mil- lion to an 'Ohana and Community Based Program Grant to support programs specifically designed to bolster the family unit. Regarding these two grants, OHA Board Chair Carmen \"Hulu\" Lindsey said, \"The COVID-19 pandemic has heavily impacted our Hawaiian community from the loss of employment to our families' ability to provide the necessities of life like food and shelter. These grants will assist with finances in a variety of areas in this time of great need. OHA is enacting a new grants structure that ensures every island will have a share of both of these grants so that there's fairness in the distribu - tion of these assets.\" According to the Native Hawaiian COVID-19 Research Hui survey of Hawai'i residents in the summer of 2020, 60% of Native Hawaiians reported a negative or very negative impact of COVID-19 on their 'ohana mental or spiritual health; 51% reported a negative or very negative impact of COVID-19 on their 'ohana physical health and finances: and 38% reported a negative or very negative impact on their 'ohana access to affordable healthy foods. Earlier this year, OHA announced three other grant solicitions: the Iwi K\u00fcpuna Repatriation and Reinterment Grant, the 'Ahahui Grant, and the Homestead Community Grant. Together with these two latest grant offerings, OHA has thus far com - mitted more than $4.25 million in grants in 2021.

Brian Schatz (D-Hawai'i), urging senators to help address the needs of Native Hawaiians. \"This committee has a long history of bipartisanship and collegiality among its members,\" Chair Lindsey said in her testimony today. \"That spirit is critical to elevating the voices of Native leaders and fulfilling the federal gov - ernment's trust responsibility owed to all Native people of the United States. Your work here empowers the Native community to continue exercising true self-determination - our right to chart our own course and maintain our dis-tinct traditions, cultures, and Native ways.\" Chair Lindsey further testified that the federal gov - ernment must honor its trust responsibility to the Native Hawaiian people; support federal programs for Native Hawaiians in the areas of health care, housing, economic development and education; and ensure parity in the treatment of all Native Americans, including American Indians, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians. Entitled \"A call to action: Native communities' priorities in focus for the 117th Congress,\" the oversight hearing marked the start of a new era for the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. Schatz was named chair of the committee in early February. He became the third Hawai'i senator to chair the committee, and the first to do so in nearly a decade. Schatz opened the hearing by stating that one of his goals as chairman is to bring Native Hawaiian issues and priorities to the forefront. \"I want to be clear that today's hearing isn't a check the box exercise,\" he said, \"It's a real opportunity for members of the Committee to chart a path forward by listening to and learning from Native leaders for the next two years and beyond. \"Now more than ever, Congress must be tuned in and listening. Native communities are experiencing dispro - portionate impacts from multiple crises - COVID-19, economic insecurity, racial injustice, and climate change. So as the strongest voice for Native priorities in the Con - gress, this Committee will act to address these challenges by working together in its bipartisan tradition and to uphold the federal treaty and trust responsibilities to tribes and Native communities across the country - from Hawai'i to Alaska and to the continental United States.\" Chair Lindsey was one of four witnesses invited to testify before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs on the priorities facing their respective Native communities. The other witnesses testifying were Fawn Sharp, president of the National Congress of American Indians, Leonard Forsman, president of the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians, and Julie Kitka, president of the Alaska Federa - tion of Natives. After the hearing, Chair Lindsey said she was honored by the opportunity to testify. \"I extend my aloha and congratulations to Chairman Brian Schatz and Vice Chairman Lisa Murkowski on their new leadership positions on the U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs,\" she said. \"Mahalo for [this] opportunity to elevate the issues of our Native communities, and we look forward to continuing this dialogue with your committee on how Congress can continue to support the needs of Hawai'i's Indigenous people.\" Follow us: /kawaiolanews | /kawaiolanews | /kawaiolanews apelila2021 5 www.oha.org/solicitations To learn more, and to see a complete list of services, please find our FY 2022 Notice to Providers of Professional Services at: OFFER OFFER PROFESSIONAL PROFESSIONAL SERVICES?SERVICES?

Season 3 WINDWARD MALL, KNE'OHE May 2, 2021 - june 30, 2021 open 7 days a week 10 am - 6pm follow us! @imanakaoiwi Zweng DEA Appendices Page 152 of Kaka'ako Makai Suffer a Setback By Puanani Fernandez-Akamine In late January, OHA executives learned that a group of legislators were introducing a bill during the 2021 legislative session that would affect OHA's commercial proper - ties in Kaka'ako Makai by raising the building height limit for two of OHA's 10 parcels and lifting the current restric - tion against residential development on six of OHA's parcels. The introduction of Senate Bill 1334 generated hope that OHA might finally be able to realize its vision of using its land at Kaka'ako Makai to create a dis - tinctly Hawaiian multi-use residential and business development adjacent to the City and County of Honolulu's beau - tiful Gateway and Waterfront parks. OHA acquired its Kaka'ako Makai land during the 2012 legislative session, when the State of Hawai'i offered to settle its 32-year past-due debt to OHA - a debt of approximately $200 mil - lion - by conveying 30 acres of land inKaka'ako Makai to the agency. Ironically, the state's appraiser valued the land at approximately $198 million, assuming a 400-foot height limit for two of the parcels on Ala Moana Blvd. The only catch was that six years ear - lier, in 2006, this same legislative body had voted to prohibit residential develop - ment in Kaka'ako Makai and to impose a 200-foot height limit. Thus, the state's generous \"settlement\" came with restric - tions that prevent OHA from actually realizing the promised value of the land. It's like paying half the debt with cash, and the other half with Monopoly money. Because of these restrictions, some reasonably questioned OHA's wisdom in accepting the Kaka'ako Makai par - cels as settlement of the state's debt which was accrued over three decades as a result of the state's failure to pro - vide OHA with its fair share of Public Land Trust revenues. However, it was a \"take it or leave it\" situation because after more than three decades of begging at the legislature, this was the state's only offer to Native Hawaiians. It should be noted that, by Hawai'i State law, 20% of Public Land Trust revenues go to OHA; and in the 40 years since the law was codified in 1980, it has never been honored by the state. Testifying in support of SB 1334 before a joint hearing of the Senate Ways and Means, Water and Land, and Judi - ciary committees on March 3, former Gov. John Waihe'e said, \"When Hawai'i joined the Union in 1959, we did so with a promise to Native Hawaiians that their ancestral lands, which were stolen at gunpoint, would be administered in such a way that specifically benefited them. Unfortunately, the history of the state implementing this legal obliga - tion to Native Hawaiians is a long series of broken promises - despite numer - ous efforts over the years to rectify the issue.\" On March 9, an overwhelming major - ity of the Senate voted to pass the bill, with 19 yes votes, six no votes, and one reservation, enabling it to cross over to the House. In a passionate speech on the floor of the Senate, one of the bill's spon - sors, Sen. Jarrett Keohokalole, made it a point to mention that the Hawai'i State Attorney General has clarified that OHA's Kaka'ako Makai lands are Native Hawaiian trust assets, not public lands as opponents have claimed. Sen. Keohokalole said he was sup - porting the bill because Honolulu needs housing for its residents near jobs, infra - structure and the rail line. He went on to say that while the residential prohibition on development at Kaka'ako Makai may have made sense in 2006, it no longer does; there is a projected housing short - age in Hawai'i of about 65,000 units, and the state's failure to address the housing crisis adversely affects the credibility of the legislature. \"We have no credibility to the young families, who constantly check Craig - slist for rentals in my district, and can't see any whole home rental offerings on the Windward side for under $3,500 a month,\" said Sen.

We must strive to do our best work. -'\u00d6lelo No'eau With an overall goal of bring-ing vision and execution together through effec - tive strategy, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs invites readers to review \"Mana i Mauli Ola (Strength to Wellbeing),\" the organization's new strategic plan through 2035. Based on community input and approved by trustees in September 2020, the plan features three foundational areas of focus: 'Ohana (family), Mo'omeheu (culture), and '\u00c4ina (land and water). These foundations represent traditional strengths, or mana, of Native Hawaiian communities. OHA aims to build upon these community strengths to move the l\u00e4hui toward positive change in areas where Native Hawaiians face barriers and disparities. Beyond that overall lens, OHA is responding to community mana'o by estab - lishing four strategic directions that are key to impacting l\u00e4hui wellbeing: Educational Pathways, Economic Stability, Quality Housing and Health Outcomes. By using 'ohana, mo'omeheu, and '\u00e4ina- based approaches within these areas where Native Hawaiians face challenges, OHA will support the movement of the l\u00e4hui toward mauli ola, or total wellbeing, in education, economic stability, housing, and health. Other plan highlights include an increased focus on addressing system level change by advancing policies, programs and practices in targeted areas of need, and a greater emphasis on specific community partner - ships. Another key aspect to the plan is that OHA will be implementing three-year, data- driven check-ins to monitor plan progress, something that the organization has not done before. \"As we have heard from our community, and learned from experiencing COVID-19, OHA needs to be more responsive to rap - idly change contexts. Therefore, this plan builds in reflection and pivot points every three years,\" said Carla Hostetter, director of OHA's Systems Office. OHA Ka Pou Nui/Chief Operating Offi- cer Casey Brown agrees. \"Monitoring of progress has happened at OHA before, but what I'm excited about with this new plan is that we will be incor - porating more data to drive decisions. This will allow OHA to be more adaptive and strengthen our ability to course correct,\" Brown said. \"This is something we all believe in, and we know that organizations that don't refo - cus themselves regularly to become more adaptive are going to fall behind.\" OHA's vision statement, which was reaf - firmed by trustees as part of the strategic planning process, is \"Ho'ulu L\u00e4hui Aloha - To Raise a Beloved L\u00e4hui.\" The state - ment blends the thoughts and leadership ofboth King Kal\u00e4kaua and his sister, QueenLili'uokalani. Both faced tumultuous times - as we do today - and met their challenges head on. \"Ho'oulu L\u00e4hui\" was King Kal\u00e4kaua's motto. \"Aloha\" expresses the high values of Queen Lili'uokalani. OHA Ka Pouhana/Chief Executive Offi- cer Dr. Sylvia Hussey said she is ready to build upon the organizational accomplish - ments of the past and achieve the vision that has been set forth for the future. \"We want this organization to be the best that it can possibly be, because that's the kind of agency our beneficiaries and l\u00e4hui deserve,\" she said. \"Raising an abundant and thriving l\u00e4hui is at the heart of what we do. We carry with us the wisdom of our ancestors, the poten - tial of our youth and the willingness of our community collaborators to unite and serve our people. By uplifting Hawaiians, we can make Hawai'i a better place for all who live here.\" Look for a series of articles in Ka Wai Ola over the next several months which will detail the specific goals and objectives of Mana i Mauli Ola. 6 apelila2021 kawaiola.news | kwo@OHA.org NATIVE HAWAIIAN \u00bb NEWS | FEATURES | EVENTS SEE KAKA'AKO MAKAI ON PAGE 7See special insert to explore Mana i Mauli Ola Zweng Appendices | /kawaiolanews apelila2021 7 ment on a $900,000 offering, of which at any given point there are less than 200 for sale on the island of O'ahu.\" But OHA's jubilance over the senate vote was short- lived. Six days later, on March 15, leaders in the House of Representatives decided unilaterally that they would not hear the bill at all. In remarks to opponents of SB 1334 who gathered for a \"Save Our Kaka'ako Makai Rally\" held at the State Capi - tol on March 16, House Speaker Rep. Scott Saiki said that he had advised OHA Board of Trustees Chairperson Carmen \"Hulu\" Lindsey that the House would not advance SB 1334. \"There is not a compelling reason for the legislature to reverse this prohibition,\" said Rep. Saiki. \"Some will say that I oppose S.B. 1334 because Kaka'ako Makai is a part of my House district. This is not accurate. The issue here is larger than one person's House district.\" \"Kaka'ako Makai is the last remaining parcel of viable open space between Waik\u00efk\u00ef and the airport,\" continued Rep. Saiki. \"Preventing residential development will pre - vent uncontrolled development and preserve this open space for the next generation and the next-next genera - tion.\" He concluded his remarks noting that he and Sen. Sharon Moriwaki (who also represents Kaka'ako) will \"attempt to work with OHA to explore alternatives to developing Kaka'ako Makai.\" It should be noted that Sen. Moriwaki was one of the six senators who opposed SB 1334. In response, Lindsey offered the following public state - ment: \"OHA is deeply disappointed that a bill that would allow Native Hawaiians to develop housing in Kaka'ako Makai appears to be dead. We are saddened that Native Hawai - ians were robbed of an opportunity to have their voices heard in a single hearing in the House of Representatives. \"Nevertheless, we remain steadfast. We understand that the pursuit of justice and self-determination for Native Hawaiians continues to be a challenge. We will now turn our attention to finishing our planning efforts. We hope that our progress over the next year will demonstrate that a Native Hawaiian vision for Kaka'ako Makai is some - thing that the entire state will support. We look forward to coming back to the Legislature again next year to continue the discussion of allowing Native Hawaiians to build hous - ing on our lands. \"OHA thanks our friends in the Senate for providing Native Hawaiians with a fair chance to make our case. In addition, we thank our growing number of supporters within the Native Hawaiian community and the broader public.\" For more information on OHA's plans to develop its commercial properties at Kaka'ako Makai please visit www.oha.org/kakaakomakai2021.

The Hawai'i State Department of Health declared the area a hotspot. By November, Wai'anae's positivity rate was 12 percent - better, but far from ideal. Dr. Nalani Blaisdell-Brennan, who has been with the Wai'anae Coast Comprehensive Health Center (WCCHC) for 14 years, sent out a k\u00e4hea to Dr. Gerard Akaka, vice president of Native Hawaiian Affairs and Clinical Sup-port for The Queen's Health Systems and former medical director of WCCHC, and Dr. Marcus Iwane, an internal medicine physician at Kaiser Permanente's Nanaikeola Clinic in N\u00e4n\u00e4kuli. They began meeting weekly with Ku'ulei Birnie, communications coordinator for Papa Ola L\u00f6kahi, a nonprofit that focuses on Native Hawaiian health and wellbeing, to strategize ways to improve the statistics. The CDC had been widely broadcasting the importance of wearing masks, washing hands and social distancing to stop the spread of COVID-19. The Hawaiian kauka real -ized to have an impact with a Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander (NHPI) audience, however, the message needed to be shared in a culturally meaningful way. They landed upon the idea of creating a Public Service Announcement (PSA) featuring a beloved member of the community. According to Blaisdell-Brennan, few people are more trusted and respected in Wai'anae than famed waterman Buffalo Keaulana and his loving wife of 60 years, Momi. Through his job as a lifeguard at M\u00e4kaha Beach, Buffalo has been credited with saving thousands of lives. \"We wanted a warm approach where family members could speak from the heart about the importance of legacy, kuleana and 'ohana as they relate to the pandemic,\" Blais - dell-Brennan said. \"It took many phone calls and personal visits to convince Uncle Buff and Aunty Momi to partici - pate; they do not seek the limelight. However, the message of saving lives resonated with the family's ethos. Brian is their eldest child. As busy as he is with his work as a stunt coordinator and second-unit action director for movies and TV shows, he said, 'This is what we do; we help people.'\" The weather was perfect on the day of the shoot. First, the crew planned to film Brian's segment at M\u00e4kaha Beach; after that, they would meet Uncle Buffalo and Aunty Momi at their home. \"We were going to do just one 30-second \"Then came the unexpected: Unscripted, delivered her own personal PSA in one take! She ended it with a heartfelt plea: 'Please, everyone. The life you save may be your own. Mahalo, Ke Akua.'\" Brian's PSA includes photos of his large, close-knit family. \"Why should I care?\" he asks in the spot. \"Because I love my 'ohana. [Staying safe from the virus] takes all of us together.\" His father-in-law passed away in February after con - tracting COVID-19, so he fully understands the grief and anguish so many people are going through from losing a loved one to the disease. It's easy to worry, to be afraid, but the antidote, he believes, is following the facts and science rather than listening to rumors and conspiracy theories. SEE COMBAT COVID-19 ON PAGE 9 (L-R) Dr. Nalani Blaisdell-Brennan, Dr. Marcus Iwane, Brian Keaulana, Dr. Gerard Akaka and Ku'ulei Birnie teamed together to create two public service announcement s targeting Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communitie s to help educate them about COVID-19 and the importance of ongoing vigilance to protect against this potentially deadly disease.- Photo: Renea Veneri just 8.8% Since mid-December, when Hawai'i started implementing its vaccination program, only 8.8% of Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (NHPI) have received at least one dose despite the fact that they account for 41% of COVID-19 cases in the state. That was a major finding of a report released on March 16 by the Hawai'i State Depart - ment of Health (DOH) and its academic and community partners, including the Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander COVID-19 Response, Recovery and Resilience Team, of which OHA is a member. The seemingly low NHPI percentage should be taken in context, however. For example, following federal guidelines, health-care workers in Hawai'i were the first to get vaccinated, but NHPI represen- tation in that industry is relatively low. Next, seniors aged 75 years and older were allowed to be vac - cinated, but NHPI life expectancy falls below other racial groups in the state. That also limited NHPI numbers for this vaccine prioritization category. Other reasons for the disparity include lan- guage barriers, lack of computer expertise and transportation issues (e.g., people can't get to a vaccination site because it's not on a bus line, they don't drive, they don't have a car, or they don't know anyone who can take them). The DOH is considering ways to address these challenges, and education is key. Native Hawaiian physicians, cultural practitioners and other commu- nity leaders will discuss the importance of getting vaccinated in upcoming issues of Ka Wai Ola.\"The ocean has been the lifeblood of my family for decades, but we know it can also be dan - gerous,\" Brian said. \"My dad taught us kids to understand danger and to face our fears. If you have knowledge, you're not going to have fear.\" Like his father, Brian is a veteran surfer, lifeguard and all-around waterman; he has also developed water safety training programs for military special operations forces and prestigious surfing events around the world. He sees the pandemic as the biggest wave he's ever had to conquer. \"I feel like it's holding me underwater, but I know I have to relax, hold my breath and hope all the risk mitigation procedures I've learned will take me to a safe place,\" he said. \"Education is the best tool we have when we need to make decisions that could mean life or death.\" To that end, OHA is one of 40-plus agencies, organizations and state departments in the Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Hawai'i COVID-19 Response, Recovery and Resilience Team (NHPI 3R), which was formed last May to address the impact of the pandemic on NHPI communities. As the \"backbone\" of that coalition, Papa Ola L\u00f6kahi paid for the production of the two Keaulana PSAs and the airing of them during 569 prime morning and evening slots on KGMB, KHNL and KFVE from February through May. \"We've established partnerships to produce other PSAs, manage a website [www.NHPI - COVIDHawaii.net] and create a repository of in-language resources for the purpose of provid-ing accurate and timely information to the Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities that we serve,\" Birnie said. \"These projects are part of the NHPI 3R Team's mission to improve the collection and reporting of accurate COVID-19 data, support statewide initiatives that address NHPI concerns and maintain a strong voice in the decision-making processes that affect our com - munities.\" Along with mandated mask use and greater availability of vaccines, these efforts are yielding promising results. As this issue went to press in late March, Wai'anae's positivity rate was down to one percent, with no more than 10 known active COVID-19 cases. Cheryl Chee Tsutsumi has written 12 books and countless newspaper, magazine and website arti - cles about Hawai'i's history, culture, food and lifestyle.COMBAT COVID-19 Continued from page 8 Buffalo and Momi Keaulana with their | kwo@OHA.org NATIVE HAWAIIAN \u00bb NEWS | FEATURES | EVENTS The Kali'uokapa'akai Collective Report Re-envisioning wahi term wahi k\u00fcpuna refers to a physical site, area, or landscape that is significant to K\u00e4naka '\u00d6iwi, past and present. While every place in Hawai'i could be con - sidered special or significant, this term can broadly encompass ancestral landscapes where k\u00fcpuna repeatedly and purposefully interacted, but also places of purposeful non-use. Often, these places provide evidence of k\u00fcpuna inter - actions via physical manipulation of the space such as burials, heiau, lo'i kalo, loko i'a, ala as significantly, some wahi k\u00fcpuna contain no tangible evidence of human modification, but are still places of our ancestors through mo'ok\u00fc'auhau, inoa '\u00e4ina, mo'olelo K\u00e4naka '\u00d6iwi because of the longstanding relationships and interconnections Native Hawaiians have with these places. Wahi k\u00fcpuna are the tangible links to the past through which we maintain con - nections to previous generations, and perpetuate these connections for future generations. They shape our iden - tity, and inform and inspire our living values, traditions, and practices.These spaces are imbued with mana and meaning from generations of Native Hawaiians living in particular places and developing inseverable relationships with the land. Thus, an integral tenet of Wahi K\u00fcpuna Stewardship (WKS) is recognizing the relationship between Native Hawaiians and place, because the people that have evolved with their environments are just as important as the places themselves. Kali'uokapa'akai Collective The Kali'uokapa'akai Collective (KC) was created in 2017 to address the pressing need to organize our shared ideas, resources, and strate - gies to build capacity and take collective action in safeguarding Hawai'i's wahi k\u00fcpuna. We are made up of advocates, leaders, and change agents who represent many different fields and disciplines, but who all care about Hawai'i's wahi k\u00fcpuna. 2019 Think Tank In April 2019, the KC convened the first Kali'uokapa'akai Collective Think Tank. Over 100 participants from 15 different sectors and 80 organizations participated in the two-day work - ing conference to discuss a range of challenges, opportunities, and solutions for Wahi K\u00fcpuna Stewardship in Hawai'i.

During this gathering, real-time data was compiled through ignite talks, topic area panels, facilitated breakout discussions, and live surveys. Participants shared, documented, evaluated, and prioritized existing and new information, knowledge, and practices regarding Wahi K\u00fcpuna Stewardship. From here, the KC created working groups to carry on the Think Tank discussions and brainstorm how to implement the proposed action items. The KC hopes to hold these types of \"conferences with kuleana\" every two to three years to continue to tackle systems change in Cultural Resource Management (CRM). Kali'uokapa'akai Collective Report Early on, the KC realized that a more complete understanding of the current state of CRM in Hawai'i was needed in order to address how to improve the system. It was decided that a critical first initiative of the KC would be to compile foundational CRM/WKS data in a holistic document from a Kanaka '\u00d6iwi perspective. This report will serve as a guiding document to steer the KC along this new ala loa (path) over the next few years. This report aims to bring awareness to specific WKS issues and highlight ways that individuals, organizations, profes - sionals, and others can take action towards greater stewardship of our wahi k\u00fcpuna. To promote future collaborations, increase awareness on issues surrounding CRM and WKS, and in efforts to grow capacity and resources for wahi k\u00fcpuna stewards, Collective members prioritized our efforts around the following four Focus Areas that are highlighted in the report: We also propose \"16 Calls to Action\" in the report that will help our Collective and support - ing partners further carry out our kuleana of stewarding wahi k\u00fcpuna. And while much needs to be done to truly reshape the historic preservation and CRM systems in Hawai'i, we recognize that many of these calls to action are just the initial steps in long term processes. The kuleana of Wahi K\u00fcpuna Stewardship is a k\u00e4kou effort, where each of us has a contribution to make.

No further mandate or consideration is necessary,\" Hopkins reports. He also urged the 12th State Legislature currently in session to adopt a concurrent resolution placing a mor - atorium on the development of fresh water and ocean resources in Kahana until such time as the park is fully developed. Hopkins recommended that: The Department of Land and Natural Resources pro- ceed within utmost haste to expedite its plan for a living park in Kahana by immediately implement - ing the provisions of the 1978 revised Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for Kahana Valley State Park. The first order of business of DLNR should be the constitution and activation of the Kahana ValleyAdvisory Board \"as the major policy initiating bodyfor Kahana Valley State Park,\" and be afforded theresponsibilities as spelled out on page 15 of therevised EIS for the park. (Some action has alreadytaken place on this matter.) DLNR, with the advice of the Advisory Board, strive to resolve the residents' housing problems in termsof location, renovations and/or reconstruction anddevelop the means of granting residents long termleases in the valley. \"It is 18 years too long. And two and one-half years to verify the status of 20 permittees is an uncalled for delay,\" Hopkins said. Hopkins researched the entire project, working in con - cert with DLNR Chairman Susumu Ono, staff of the State Parks Division, Land Management Division and residents of Kahana Valley and community and agency representa - tives who shared their experiences and knowledge of the valley in response to OHA's concern and support.In this thorough research of Kahana Valley, Hopkins chronicled events from 1800 to the present when legisla - tion on development of the area as a park was adopted in 1970. Since the state's acquisition of Kahana Valley, residents have been living there on month-to-month revocable permits. Their tenure remains uncertain. Legislators and the Governor's Task Force, however, declared their tenure as an integral part of a living park and at the Governor's urging, BLNR adopted the living park concept. All this took place in the early 1970s. The years dragged on and still written and spoken words about the residents' role were not translated into action. These delays sapped the strength and vitality of the residents. A number of kupunas in the valley have died and their knowledge and lifestyle are lost forever. Homes have deteriorated and are being held together as best as can be expected under the tenuous conditions of a permit. Children have grown and have had to expand their energies in directions other than the perpetuation of the invaluable human resources of the valley. Hopkins feels a lot of the problems of working with residents could have been avoided had the State seen the wisdom of using persons knowledgeable of the com - munity lifestyle and sensitive to the rural environment to serve as a communication link between DLNR and Kahana residents. It may not be too late to utilize this kind of resource, Hopkins suggests. In commemoration of OHA's 40th anniversary, throughout 2021 Ka Wai Ola will feature select articles from the newspaper's archives.

It can be especially hard to find reliable data on Native Hawaiians, spe - cifically, rather than data that groups Native Hawaiians with other Pacific ethnicities. Recognizing the need for reliable data from a Native Hawaiian perspective, Kamehameha Schools has published a Native Hawaiian Educational Assessment peri - odically since 1983, providing data specific to Hawai'i and Native Hawaiians; it was renamed Ka Huaka'i in 2005. With over 600 pages devoted to data, research, and community insight into Native Hawaiian wellbeing, Ka Huaka'i 2021 is a free community resource pub - lished by Kamehameha Publishing and available as a downloadable PDF at https://www.ksbe.edu/ka_huakai/. This book treats education as one part of a larger system of wellbeing, and includes data on a variety of educational, social, physical, material/economic, and spri - tual/emotional trends and outcomes. Data from a range of sources such as the Hawai'i Department of Health, the Hawai'i Department of Education, and the US Census are visualized in over 200 easy-to-read charts. These charts are contextualized within the latest research on wellbeing and community perspectives, with more than 700 refer - ences cited.Ka Huaka'i 2021 co-author Brandon Ledward says the authors \"celebrate the fact that we can draw upon research from Native Hawaiians across a wide list of academic fields. When combined with community perspectives and examples, these data comprise a deep and vast knowledge base that supports and extends our 'ike k\u00fcpuna.\" A new feature of the 2021 publication is the addition of regional and county data for a number of topics. The data and analysis provides base - line information from before the COVID-19 pandemic, and Wendy Kekahio, co-author, adds that \"Ka Huaka'i represents an evolv - ing, albeit incomplete, story of Native Hawai - ian wellbeing at a time when the world has the opportunity to be rebuilt.\" Findings in Ka Huaka'i 2021 include bright spots of positive momentum as well as areas of persistent challenges for Native Hawaiian wellbeing. In the realm of education, for example, of all the bachelor's degrees conferred by the UH system in 2009, 14 percent were conferred to Native Hawaiians; by 2018, the proportion had risen to 27 percent. At the same time, however, a disproportionate number of Native Hawaiian students in public schools are still struggling to graduate on time. Ka Huaka'i 2021 calls for the increased adoption and development of Hawaiian Culture-Based Education as a foun - dational strategy to remove systemic barriers to Native Hawaiian wellbeing, and the authors hope that readers will use this free digital book as a resource to learn about their communities and to advocate for positive change.

There, where the cooling Waik\u00f6loa and Wai'\u00f6pua winds carry the fragrance of the forests from the Wai'anae mountains, are many sacred sites, and most notable among them are the birthing stones of K\u00fckaniloko. K\u00fckaniloko is believed to have been constructed almost a thousand years ago by Nanakaoko and his chiefess, Kahihikalani, in anticipation of the birth of their son, Kapawa. Imbued with the mana of gen - erations of ali'i, this most sacred of wahi k\u00fcpuna is considered the spiritual piko of O'ahu. K\u00e4kuhihewa, who reigned in the 17th century and was of O'ahu's most celebrated chiefs, is the last ali'i known to have been born at K\u00fckaniloko. Of the ali'i born at K\u00fckaniloko over half a mil - lennium, M\u00e4'ilik\u00fckahi is especially notable for his wisdom and leadership. Centuries after his pass - ing, he is still remembered as an astute ruler whose revolutionary ideas and skillful land management ultimately impacted the entire pae '\u00e4ina and subse-quent generations of '\u00d6iwi. At just 29-years-old, M\u00e4'ilik\u00fckahi was chosen to reign as ali'i nui of O'ahu at a time of great tumult and chaos. His notorious predecessor, Haka, had been deposed, leaving a legacy of disarray, mostly stemming from land disputes. M\u00e4'ilik\u00fckahi is credited for establishing Hawai'i's system of land division. He divided O'ahu into moku, ahupua'a, 'ili k\u00fcpono, and so forth, and developed a tiered structure of ali'i, based on rank, to manage each land division. This geo-political system clearly defined kuleana for the land across all members of society, and was critical to maintaining order and settling long-standing land disputes. He is also thought to have created Hawai'i's first code of laws, ensured freedom to maka'\u00e4inana wishing to leave the service of unjust chiefs, and forbade human sacrifice.Today, M\u00e4'ilik\u00fckahi remains a role model for effective leadership and prudent land management for modern K\u00e4naka Maoli. Changing lands changing hands In the 1800s, the forests which blanketed the slopes of the Wai'anae mountains were decimated by the sandalwood trade and by the whaling indus - try, enabled by avaricious and unscrupulous chiefs seeking foreign wealth. This devastated the ecosys - tem and landscape of the Wahiaw\u00e4 Plateau. But the most destructive impact to the environ - ment resulted from the establishment of ranching and monocrop agriculture in central O'ahu. Ranching activities began in the mid-19th century, made possible by the M\u00e4hele of 1848. The 1893 overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom precipitated the conversion of Hawaiian Crown Lands into pri - vate landholdings, which, in turn, allowed for the establishment of massive sugar and pineapple plan - tations, and construction of a 14,400-acre military reservation by the U.S. Government on Hawaiian lands at Wahiaw\u00e4. Ranching and intensive monocrop agriculture on the Wahiaw\u00e4 Plateau necessitated the construction of irrigation systems and a dam near the north and south forks of Kaukonahua Stream. This formed the Wahiaw\u00e4 Reservoir, known today as Lake Wilson. Due to rising labor costs, the last sugar planta - tion in Hawai'i shut down in 1980, while pineapple production slowed and eventually stopped in 2008. However, decades of monocrop agriculture had severely degraded the quality of the soil. In 1882, George Galbraith, a rancher from Ireland, purchased 2,000 acres of land in Wahiaw\u00e4, which included K\u00fckaniloko. To his credit, Galbraith was respectful of the site, fencing in the area to protect it from cattle and ranching activities. Galbraith leased the lands encompassing K\u00fckaniloko to the Waialua Agriculture Company in 1900 for pineapple production. The plantation manager for the company continued to care for K\u00fckaniloko through 1918. Kuleana for the site then passed to the Daughters of Hawai'i, the Waialua Hawaiian Civic Club, and then in 1960, to the Hawaiian Civic Club of Wahiaw\u00e4 (HCCW), which K\u00fckaniloko was constructed approximately 1,000 years ago. The first ali'i born there was Kapawa, whose parents are credited with having overseen the site's construction specif - ically for his birth; K\u00e4kuhihewa, who reigned during the 17th century, was the last ali'i to be born at K\u00fckaniloko. - Photo: /kawaiolanews | /kawaiolanews apelila2021 15 continues to play a critical role in caring for and main - taining this wahi k\u00fcpuna. In 1973, K\u00fckaniloko was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, and in 1988 the Depart - ment of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) acquired the approximately half-acre of land where the birthing stones rest by an executive order of then-Gov. John Waihe'e, although HCCW continued to steward the site. In 1992, K\u00fckaniloko and a 4.5-acre buffer of sur - rounding land were designated a state park, expanding the parcel to its current size of 5 acres. By the end of the 20th century, the remaining 1,732 acres of Galbraith's estate represented one of the largest undeveloped plots of land on O'ahu. For years, real estate spectulators fancied the land for luxury homes; in 1992 a trustee of Galbraith's estate proposed the development of an 18-hole golf course and 3,100 homes. However, that and other attempts at the sale and development of these lands were, providentially, unsuccessful. OHA acquires 511 acres surrounding Ku_kaniloko After Galbraith's trustees began dissolving his estate in 2007, the Hawai'i State Legislature set aside $13 mil - lion to purchase the land, partnering with the nonprofit conservation organization Trust for Public Land, who worked with various other collaborators, including the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA), to raise an additional $12 million. The Galbraith estate was purchased by the state in 2012 for $25 million. The land was transferred to two public agencies: 1,200 acres went to the Hawai'i State Agribusiness Develop - ment Corporation, while 511 acres surrounding the 5-acre K\u00fckaniloko Birthstones State Monument weretransferred to OHA. OHA reached an agreement with DLNR to assume the kuleana for management of K\u00fckaniloko, and three years later entered into a formal stewardship agreement with HCCW to continue their decades-long kuleana as the caretakers of K\u00fckaniloko. With the protection and management of K\u00fckaniloko secured, in 2016, OHA began a conceptual master plan - ning process for the surrounding 511-acre parcel led by the agency's land department. K\u00fckaniloko is an extremely sacred place of great his- torical significance; it is a cultural k\u00efpuka (oasis) and resource to Native Hawaiians and the larger commu - nity for current and future generations. But the lands surrounding K\u00fckaniloko are overgrown with invasive species, and the soil is degraded by decades of pineapple monoculture. From the outset, OHA's goal has been to manage the land in a culturally appropriate and pono manner by hon - oring and protecting the birthing stones, restoring the forest and watershed, exploring options for compatible agriculture, and contributing to Hawai'i's food security. The planning process began with OHA initiating a comprehensive community engagement effort which included interviewing thought leaders from within the Native Hawaiian community, engaging neighboring landowners, conducting extensive historical and cultural research, creating case studies, hosting multiple com - munity meetings, and forming a 10-member Cultural Working Group (CWG) to help with the actual planning. The CWG was comprised of individuals with expertise in cultural and natural resource management, agricul-ture, archaeology, business and marketing, education, Hawaiian culture, and environmental and property law. Building on the initial round of community feedback, a kumupa'a (foundation) for the planning work was established which reads, in part, \"This place is a wahi kapu with mana that has existed since time immemorial and will exist for time eternal. It is an ecosystem of con - nectivity between '\u00e4ina and k\u00e4naka.\" From remediation). These values served as a filter for the entire planning process and continue to serve as the foundation for further devel - opment and implementation of the Conceptual Master Plan (CMP). In all, the planning process took two and a half years. OHA's Conceptual Master Plan and vision for Ku_kaniloko In September 2018, the CMP was presented to OHA trustees who supported the long-term direction of the CMP and authorized ongoing efforts towards its imple - mentation. The CMP focuses on \"embracing the history and culture of Wahiaw\u00e4 by bringing community together through regeneration of the land, food security, cultural education and the design of desirable spaces\" in a way that will \"create a place of intimacy between '\u00e4ina and k\u00e4naka.\" As a result of the planning effort, four programmatic outcomes emerged: Integrated Programming; Education Continuum; Hub & Spoke; and Vegetation Continuum (see sidebar). A key component of the vision for OHA's 511 acres at Wahiaw\u00e4 is reforestation. This includes re-establishment of the native forest, as well as planting a native food (semi-managed) forest, and agro-forestry. Planting native trees to recreate the native forest that was destroyed as a result of ranching and mono - crop agriculture allows for the holistic restoration of the ecosystem, watershed and soil health. Tree species identified for the reforestation effort include 'iliahi (san - dalwood), koa, '\u00f6hi'a lehua, lama and 'ohe (bamboo). It will take decades to transform the land from its current state (overgrown grasslands) back into a forest, so plant - ing efforts have already started, but the availability of water remains an obstacle. The plan also calls for establishment of a semi-man - aged native food forest that integrates native forest trees with trees/plants cultivated for specific medicinal or cultural uses, as well as food crops. The semi-managed native food forest will include 'ulu Working Group Leilani Basham, Ph.D., UH Mnoa Hawai'inuikea School of Hawaiian Knowledge Jesse Cooke, CPA, Ulu Pono Initiative Susan Crow, Ph.D., UH M\u00e4noa, College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources Jo-lin Lenchanko Kalimapau, Hawaiian Civic Jonah La'akapu Lenchanko, Hawaiian Civic Club of Wahiaw Thomas Joseph Lenchanko, Hawaiian Civic Club of Wahiaw Noa Kekuewa Lincoln, Ph.D., UH Mnoa, College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources Kukui Maunakea-Forth, MA 'O Organic Farms Manulani MA Organic Farms Maka Casson-Fisher, Hawaiian Civic Club of Wahiaw Jesse Cooke, CPA, Ulu Pono Initiative TJ Cuaresma, Office of Representative Amy Perusso Hawaiian Civic Club of Organic Farms Kawika International, Inc.

Like the native forest, the semi-managed forest is a high priority as it will take years to establish. The planned agro-forest will be designated for food and medicinal crops, and for plants that are culturally important. This will help to ensure rapid growth for the fast revival of carbon, and provide plants that can be utilized to generate income, as well as plants for medicinal and educational purposes. A significant portion of the land is also being des - ignated for high-tech agriculture that incorporates cutting-edge agricultural methodologies and technolo- gies such as hydroponics, aquaponics and greenhouse cultivation. None of this will affect the 5 acres that protect the sacred stones of K\u00fckaniloko; the 5-acre parcel will be further buffered from other activities on the land by landscaping and native forests. OHA also plans to establish a community space to be used as a gathering place for events and for on-site cultural programming where Hawaiian art and culture can be practiced, shared and taught. And, building on the legacy of leadership inspired by M\u00e4'ilik\u00fckahi, as a center for '\u00d6iwi leadership training. \"This is about creating leaders,\" said CWG member Kukui Maunakea-Forth. \"This is the place to strengthen our l\u00e4hui [with] leaders who are going to go back home, not going to the mainland.\" Added CWG member Tom Lenchanko, \"K\u00fckaniloko can serve as an example of what could happen in your respective places. Experts in every field will be wait-ing here to train the future leaders of our nation.\" In addition to some initial planting of native trees by OHA staff members, and monthly meetings with the K\u00fckaniloko Advisory Hui, work on the plan to date has also included ongoing research in collabora - tion with an '\u00d6iwi-led team of researchers from the University of Hawai'i on soil remediation and vegeta - tion typography. Nearly 80 acres have already been cleared of invasive trees and grasses, and professional designers, along with members of the Wahiaw\u00e4 com - munity, are helping to conceptualize spaces that will facilitate the re-vegetation and educational objectives of the CMP, as well as the protection of K\u00fckaniloko. OHA has also engaged a security contractor to protect the entire site from tresspassing and vandalism. Inspired by the culture and history of this sacred wahi k\u00fcpuna, OHA is collaborating with the commu-nity to create a place where K\u00e4naka Maoli from keiki to k\u00fcpuna, can come together to learn and live our cul - ture, where the legacy of the ali'i born and trained at K\u00fckaniloko for leadership can be carried on by future generations of '\u00d6iwi leaders, and where the natural environment and ecology of the Wahiaw\u00e4 Plateau is restored and can continue to flourish and enrich our l\u00e4hui in perpetuity.

The Education Continuum promotes generationally integrated learning to provide our cur - rent and future generations access to the lessons learned by our kpuna. This concept will be perptuated through education and engagement programs that support a traditional model of reciprocal learning. Hub & Spoke refers to the vision for Kkaniloko to become a \"hub\" to connect other similar efforts on O'ahu and across the pae 'ina. It will bridge movements and leverage resources and iniatives so that people will gain knowledge at Kkaniloko and take that 'ike back to their moku, ahupua'a and 'ili. The Vegetation Continuum incorporates the full spectrum of vegetation planning strategies, from native forests to high-tech agriculture. By creating a diverse ecosystem, native trees will help to restore the watershed, which will feed the understory and, ultimately, feed the lhui.

It is to do all you can for our l\u00e4hui, to m\u00e4lama the place that provides for us, and to perpetuate our lan - guage, culture and traditions. It's hard to understand the depth of that kuleana as a young child, but as I got older, I realized how great a kuleana it is, and how important it is for me to fulfil it. Throughout my childhood I was taught from two different viewpoints: through a paniolo/ ranching lens, as well as a Hawai - ian perspective. I come from generations of paniolo as well as K\u00e4naka on various ali'i lines, predominantly the Keakealani and Keawe lines. I have a deep connection to both my paniolo heritage and my Hawaiian culture. Being a senior and trying to figure out how to make an impact in my commu - nity while balancing what I am passionate about is very diffi - cult. Like most who are raised in Hawai'i it is very hard for me to consider leaving home and pur - suing higher education on the mainland; to consider leaving my family. And yet I realize that such a move will not be permanent, and so that is the very reason I have decided to leave home and give it a try for a few years. There are many different out - looks when it comes to pursuing a higher education. Some feel it is better to stay home and go to col - lege, while others believe leaving is the only way to succeed. Per - sonally I believe that 'a'ole 'ike i ka h\u00e4lau ho'okahi - not all knowl - edge is learned in one place. I plan to go to the mainland for two years, learn all I can, pursue my dreams of doing college rodeo, and come home to fulfill my kuleana once the two years are finished. I feel that we have a kuleana to our '\u00e4ina and our k\u00fcpuna, but we also have one to ourselves: to live, make memories and make the best you can with the life you are given. This is my way of fulfilling both kuleana to myself and to my k\u00fcpuna.

In January 1995, one iwi k\u00fcpuna was repa - triated from the University of Alaska Museum in Fairbanks. The museum director agreed to follow protocol and hand-carry the iwi to Hono - lulu. A month later, another iwi was repatriated by a retired doctor, also from Fairbanks, who explained that the University of Alaska Medical School used the iwi for teaching. He, too, hand-carried the iwi home. Both iwi were reburied on O'ahu. Then in June, we traveled to Hanover, N.H., to repatriate three iwi k\u00fcpuna from the Dartmouth College Hood Museum of Art. The registrar of the museum wrote us saying, \"I am honored that, in some small way, I was able to assist in the return of your ancestors and their mana. Although it saddens me to think that it required an Act of Congress to precipitate such a simple act of respect, I am heartened by these long overdue first steps.\" On that same trip, we also traveled to Rich - mond, Ind., and took possession of two iwi held by the Earlham College Moore Museum. Follow - ing their return, all five iwi k\u00fcpuna were reburied on O'ahu. The following month, we traveled to Califor- nia to repatriate two large sets of human teeth donated by Dr. William Bryan to the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. The niho (teeth) were collected from Mo'omomi, Moloka'i, and were returned there for reburial. In July, we also repatriated and reintered 25 iwi held by the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum that had been removed from Fort DeRussy on O'ahu. We supported the efforts of Hui M\u00e4lama o L\u00e4na'i in October 1995 to repatriate another 212 iwi k\u00fcpuna from L\u00e4na'i also held by the Bishop Museum. This was a troubling case given the circumstances around Dr. Kenneth Emory's col-lection of these iwi. Our support to the L\u00e4na'i families extended to helping them weave the h\u00e4na'i for reburial, as Hurricane 'Iniki had destroyed the lauhala trees on their island three years earlier. A total of 113 iwi k\u00fcpuna, along with moep\u00fc, were successfully repatriated in November 1996 from nine museums and univer - sities: University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology (62), Reading Public Museum (2), University of Arkansas Museum (2), Univer - sity of Kansas Museum of Anthropology (3), UCLA Fowler Museum (7), Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History (17), Cal State Fuller - ton Department of Anthropology (16), California Academy of Natural Science (1) and the Santa Cruz Museum Natural of History (3). We conducted most of the reburials and coor - dinated with various Hawaiian organizations to reinter the remainder on the islands of Hawai'i, Maui, L\u00e4na'i, O'ahu and Kaua'i. The following month, we supported the repatriation of three iwi k\u00fcpuna from Waimea, Kaua'i, held by the Bishop Museum, and ceremonially reburied the remains.

The property is the site of the former Pacific Tsunami Warning Center near the end of Fort Weaver Road in 'Ewa Beach, O'ahu. Congress authorized the trans - fer of government surplus land to the Hawaiian Home Lands Trust in 1995 with the enactment of the HHLRA. The HHLRA intended to provide, in part, for the settlement of claims against the United States through the exchange and transfer of federal lands for the United States' con - tinued retention of lands initially designated as available lands under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, as amended, and for the lost use of such lands. It is anticipated that this convey - ance would utilize $10 million of a $16.9 million land credit that the Hawaiian Home Lands trust has with the federal government stem - ming from an expected transfer of a 47-acre Waipah\u00fc FCC Monitor - ing Station that was not provided to DHHL by an Aug. 31, 2000 deadline. Since the enactment of the HHLRA, nearly 900 acres of fed - eral lands have been transferred to DHHL. The 'Ewa Beach parcel would represent the first transfer of lands that are suitable for homesteading. The property is near water, sewage, and electrical infrastructure with paved roads and an existing resi - dential community. All previous HHLRA land transfers have been in commercial or industrial areas that DHHL and its beneficiaries have designated for revenue-generating purposes through the Department's island planning process. From late February through mid- March, DHHL and the Department of the Interior Office of Native Hawaiian Relations sought input from Hawaiian Homes Commis - sion Act beneficiaries and Native Hawaiian organizations through a digital presentation and follow-up survey. Once the land transfer has been completed, DHHL will request funding from the Legislature for master planning purposes and begin beneficiary consultation to determine the appropriate land use.

As I reflect on who he was and all he stood for, I think of his motto \"Ho'oulu L\u00e4hui,\" which means \"to increase the nation.\" In today's world, K\u00e4naka across the globe are doing their part to learn and perpetuate our culture in so many ways. It's so inspiring to see our culture being revived when it so easily could have been lost many years ago. When I think about how I can be an advocate for our people, I think about my capacity as a realtor. One of the toughest issues I come across often is that more and more Hawaiians cannot afford Hawai'i. Our people are being priced out of our own home and moving to the continent just to be able to live comfortably. As a millennial K\u00e4naka realtor, I want to do all I can to \"Ho'oulu L\u00e4hui\" - to increase the Hawaiian nation in Hawai'i. It's difficult to afford Hawai'i, but not impossible - and being educated is key! So, here are some tips you need to know right now... You do not need a 20% down pay - ment to purchase a home! The USDA loan is a 0% down loan that can be used in many areas on all islands. For active or retired service members, the VA loan is another 0% down loan - it is an earned benefit - do not let it go to waste. A standard conventional loan can be had with as little as 5% down. Credit matters! Credit card debt and a low credit score is the silent killer for want-to-be homeowners. If your credit is low, it may take time to fix, but it is easier than you think. And, of course, living within your means is really important. The smallest sacrifices can make all the difference. If you can fit into the income brackets for \"affordable\" housing through one of the major developments (Ho'opili, Koa Ridge or Gentry Home) do it! Of course there are restrictions, but the rewards outweigh them. Moreover, the homes are brand new, beautiful, and after the live-in requirement, can be sold at market price. Sacrifice some time, and in return you could get a huge equity reward to be used for your dream home. Start small! Many people want their first home to be their dream home, which is an often unrealistic goal especially in Hawai'i. Start small and build up to your dream home. Equity is gained by owning a home and living there over a period of time. Unless you have a crystal ball, you will never truly be able to time the market. Who knows when it will go up or down? All I know is the longer you wait, the more expensive it gets. Pur - chasing real estate is not just for you. It is for your keiki and the generations after.

MA\u00afLAMA I KOU KINO CARE FOR YOUR BODY The Power of Noni By Jodi Leslie Matsuo, DrPH Written records from early historians documented the excellent health observed among Native Hawaiians. Although the variety of food they enjoyed was not nearly as extensive as today, they had what they needed to main - tain their health for generations. When our early Polynesian ancestors planned their migration to Hawai'i, they had to care - fully decide what plants were deemed most essential for their survival. With people, animals, and supplies occupying most of the space, they needed to be thoughtful in their decision-making. The noni plant was among the plants selected, which is of little surprise given its important medicinal qualities. The entire plant - leaves, fruit, bark, and roots - were used for healing. Its fruit may also have been eaten during famines as well. Noni fruit contains vitamins A and C, niacin, potassium, and a number of phy-tonutrients (naturally-occurring plant chemicals), each with unique benefits. Among two phytonutrients worth high - lighting are flavonoids and polyphenols. Flavonoids have been shown to help detox your body and decrease blood pressure and blood sugars. Polyphenols, specifically gallic acid, helps decrease arthritis, ulcers and irritable bowel dis - ease, and improves memory. These and other phytonutrients in noni have also been shown to stimulate the immune system and fight viral and bacterial infections. Noni may also help with weight loss. Besides decreasing body fat, it can also decrease total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The leaves of the noni plant can be heated and applied to bruises, wounds, and burns. The bark was used for cuts, roots for skin disorders, and immature fruit was used in various concoctions to treat a range of ailments including fractures, concussions, menstrual cramps and more. Amazing to consider that all these benefits were pack-aged in one plant! Noni juice is simple to make at home. Pick ripe noni fruit, wash, and air-dry (do not peel it). Fill a glass jar to the top with the fruit. Place the sealed jar in an area of your house that has fairly stable tem - perature and light exposure. As the noni ferments, juice will naturally accumulate at the bottom of the jar. As the fruit shrinks, add more noni to the jar. Once you have enough juice it's ready to drink. Including noni in one's daily routine must be done cautiously, as incorrect use, or too much noni, can be harmful. Con - sume only fresh noni fruit or juice - do not take noni in the form of a pill or supple - ment. According to research, a safe daily amount for adults is 2-3 fluid ounces a day. It is also recommended you talk with your doctor before taking noni, as it shouldn't be combined with certain medi - cations (including some blood pressure medications, blood thinners, and diuret - ics), or if you have chronic kidney disease or liver disease. Add a noni plant to your backyard and start your own homegrown \"farmacy.\" Born and raised in Kona, Hawai'i, Dr. Jodi Leslie Matsuo is a Native Hawaiian Registered Dietician and certified diabetes educator, with training in Integrative and Functional Nutrition.

I am Leiana, born and raised in Honomaka'u. I am Polol\u00fc. We are all, Polol\u00fc. Polol\u00fc Valley is a sacred place to Kohala. This valley holds an extraor - dinary amount of mana to the past and our ancestors. The Kohala commu - nity possesses a unique history and relationship to this special place, a world hidden from malihini foot - steps and parked cars. Our pilina to '\u00e4ina is on many levels, through our genealogy as K\u00e4naka, our kuleana to care for the land, and through our mo'olelo. Our mo'ok\u00fc'auhau connects Polol\u00fc to the first kalo and K\u00e4naka from whom we are all descended. Our k\u00fcpuna taught us that Polol\u00fc, Kohala, Hawai'i was first home to W\u00e4kea and Papa. Through their union we have ko Hawai'i Pae '\u00c4ina, kalo, and K\u00e4naka. Polol\u00fc is also a beloved kalo variety to our people. It is from this place, and with this understand-ing, that it nourished our k\u00fcpuna. It allowed them to thrive in the valleys of Kohala through H\u00e4m\u00e4kua for cen - turies.The Polol\u00fc stream is a treasured feature that supplies the brackish water pond found at the bed of the valley. The rich nutrients from this water would allow protein sources such as i'a and '\u00f6pae to supplement the ancient diet. This allowed ka po'e o Kohala to produce food and supply a prospering community. This abundance of food sources made possible through ke kahawai nui o Polol\u00fc is a metaphor for the mixing of ethnicities that took place there too. When Chinese families migrated to Hawai'i, the production of rice began. They worked alongside each other to grow rice and kalo. I am both Hawaiian and Chinese. This valley was a meeting point where these two cultures came together resulting in a multicultural structure. Polol\u00fc valley holds a deep connection to my 'ohana where my two ances - tors entwined. Mahalo e Polol\u00fc for raising me. My grandfather, Galo Fernandez, was born and raised in Kohala '\u00c4kau. \"Back then, we got around this town on horseback,\" he recalls. \"Some of my greatest memories are going down in the valley. My friend Buzzy Sproat and I would ride horses down in the valley and stay at the cabin in '\u00c4wini. We would hunt and bring home food to give [to] our families and friends.\" This tale is common to 'ohana of Kohala who call Polol\u00fc their home. To share in the bounty with loved ones on the journey home connects each person to Polol\u00fc. My grandfa-ther was saddened to hear the news about plans to develop a parking lot and proposed subdivision on this sacred land. He proclaims, \"I was in the valley so often, I was practically raised there, and it should not be used for money making.\" Let us all remember our aloha to this wahi pana, Polol\u00fc, Kohala. E 'ONIPA 'A KA\u00afKOU BE STEADFAST Invoking abundance in contemporary times By Chris Molina Today, a disproportionate number of Native Hawaiian kamali'i are in foster care. Recent data (2014-2018) reveal Native Hawaiian kamali'i comprise almost half of all children in care. Sadly, the experience of foster care may cause further damage to kamali'i, m\u00e4kua, and their relationships with each other. When looking for helpful responses to sup - port families under stress, we can heed the advice of our ancestors: \"ka w\u00e4 ma mua, ka w\u00e4 ma hope,\" and look to traditional practices for solutions to today's problems. Our ancestors knew the importance of permanency, support, and family unity and developed practices that promote resilience, abundance, and shared kuleana. This includes the practices of h\u00e4nai and luhi. N\u00e4n\u00e4 I Ke Kumu Volume I , defines h\u00e4nai as a permanent arrangement between birth par - ents and extended 'ohana and may be used for a variety of reasons. The kamali'i would be given by the birth parents in the company of others. The parents would declare, \"N\u00e4u, ke keiki k\u00fckae a na'au\" or \"I give this child, intestines, contents and all.\" This declaration made h\u00e4nai a permanent and binding agree - ment. Often birth parents remained involved in the life of their kamali'i and m\u00e4kua would confer with each other concerning the wellbe - ing of the kamali'i. A related traditional practice is luhi, a tem - porary arrangement that allows birth parents to reclaim the child at any time. A key feature of both h\u00e4nai and luhi is recognition of familial relationships while ensuring the wellbeing of kamali'i. As Native Hawaiians, we face the effects of systemic disruptions such as forced assimila - tion and institutional racism. The traditional structures that supported vibrant, nurturing 'ohana became invisible within the structures of this new and often hostile reality. This has worked to estrange us from healthy, culturally resonant ways of being, doing and knowing. While some still practice h\u00e4nai and luhi, it remains outside the child welfare system and without formal recognition. Ka Pili 'Ohana ( Ka Wai Ola 2021-January), is a collaboration between Lili'uokalani Trust, CWS, and other community partners. The col - laboration integrates traditional values and historical practices like 'ohana roles, h\u00e4nai, and luhi to expand a supportive network of both biological m\u00e4kua and resource caregiv - ers to provide safe, stable, and loving care for our kamali'i. In addition to addressing the needs of the kamali'i in care today, we collectively work to transform the foster care system to recognize and honor the importance of our traditional practices and values. Chris Molina is a strategic initiatives liaison - Neighbor Islands at Lili' uokalani Trust. He has a degree in psychology with a social work minor from Pepperdine University. He was raised in M\u00e4'ili, O'ahu.Promoting the Practices of Ha \u00afnai and Luhi Queen Lili'uokalani (seated on the right) was born to Ana - lea Keohok\u00e4lole and Caesar Kapa'akea, and was h\u00e4nai at birth by High Chief Abner P\u00e4k\u00ef and High Chiefess Laura K\u00f6nia.

The plan was developed by the residents of Maui, Moloka'i and L\u00e4na'i, and in partnership with the County of Maui and Maui Visitors and Convention Bureau (MVCB). The DMAP is a guide to rebuild, redefine and reset the direction of tourism on the three islands that make up Maui Nui. \"All credit goes to the people of L\u00e4na'i, Moloka'i and Maui who committed themselves to the DMAP process and were willing to face tough issues, embrace diverse viewpoints, explore new ideas and identify actionable priorities. The DMAP process provides a collab - orative framework within which participants are inspired to m\u00e4lama the places and traditions they cher - ish most,\" said John De Fries, HTA's president and CEO. The community-based plan focuses on key actions deemed necessary over a three-year period. The foundation of the Maui DMAP is based on HTA's 2020-2025 Stra - tegic Plan. The actions are based on the four interacting pillars of HTA's Strategic Plan - Natural Resources, Hawaiian Culture, Community, and Brand Marketing, and were devel- oped by Maui, Moloka'i, and L\u00e4na'i steering committees, comprised of residents representing their own communities, as well as the visitor industry, different business sec - tors, and nonprofit organizations.

Carmen \"Hulu\" Lindsey Chair, Isa, Ph.D. Vice Chair, Trustee, At-large E Ho'oulu i ka L\u00e4hui Ho'ona'auao: Education, Our Most Important Strategic Priority... One of the great goals of King Kal\u00e4kaua was to Ho'oulu L\u00e4hui, or to increase the Hawaiians and the Nation. After working for two and a half months on SB 1334, OHA's Kaka'ako Makai bill, I had an epiph - any upon recalling the words of our last M\u00f6'\u00ef K\u00e4ne, King David La'amea Kal\u00e4kaua, to \"Ho'oulu L\u00e4hui\" which literally means \"to increase the Nation.\" His words called upon Hawaiians to seek greater involvement in their government in response to chang - ing political winds which sought to diminish Hawaiians' power to control their political and economic destinies. Kal\u00e4kaua's words ring true for me today as I reflect upon how we all must now engage with our state legislature to do what is best for all of Hawai'i, especially as it relates to OHA's plans to steward and develop its Kaka'ako lands, and to thereby be able to better steward and care for its Native Hawaiian beneficiaries. State legislators were told of our vision, our hopes, and our dreams for Kaka'ako Makai to create a Hawaiian cultural gathering spot, a Hawaiian sense of place, a place where Hawai'i's people could work, live, and play in an area accessible to jobs, commerce, shopping, mass tran - sit, parks, and the ocean. Those conversations were invigo - rating and exciting, in part because of the assumptions by some that the Office of Hawaiian Affairs was just another developer with no stake and no connection to the land, the ocean, and the people, and that we were out to make as much money as possible with little concern for the '\u00e4ina, our l\u00e4hui, or the people of Hawai'i. As the Indigenous and Native people of Hawai'i, nothing could be further from the truth. On Tuesday, March 9, the Senate passed SB1334 SD1, allowing for res - idential housing on some of OHA's Kaka'ako parcels, and raising the allowable height for two of OHA's lots on busy Ala Moana Boulevard from 200 to 400 feet. Senators overwhelm - ingly understood that it made sense to allow for the development of resi - dential housing away from the shoreline and in the business corridor, and that such a development would be in the best interest of not only OHA's Native Hawai - ian beneficiaries, but for all of Hawai'i as a means to address Hawai'i's perennial housing shortage. On March 15, OHA learned that the House will not be scheduling hear - ings on our bill meaning that unless something drastic happens, OHA's Kaka'ako bill will not pass this year. The OHA trustees' obligation to their Native Hawaiian beneficiaries is to protect their rights and to chal-lenge laws which unconstitutionally prevent them from developing their makai properties as private develop - ers mauka of Ala Moana are now allowed to do. One strategy is to legally chal - lenge HRS 206E-31.5(2) as \"special legislation\" which preserves view planes for residential towers mauka of Ala Moana Boulevard by pro - hibiting Hawaiians from building housing on any of its 30 plus acres of its Kaka'ako makai lands. Another strategy is to pass SB1334 SD1. This isn't about OHA but is instead about \"special interest\" politics. OHA is entitled to parity with the same zoning allowances that other mauka developers have already received. HRS 206E-31.5(2) discriminates against Hawaiians and favors special interests over the public interest. It must either be overturned by a court or repealed by passage of SB1334 SD1. I call upon Hawaiians to ho'oulu l\u00e4hui, to increase your knowledge and understanding of how Hawaiians' rights to self-determination in the use of their trust lands will benefit Hawai - ians in perpetuity. Mahalo a nui loa! Welina! Aloha mai k\u00e4kou! This month I am featuring Dr. Glenn Medeiros, our very own homegrown boy from L\u00e4wa'i, Kaua'i whose education took him from singer/musician to Presi - dent of Saint Louis High School! He wanted to share his journey. Mahalo nui, Dr. Medeiros! I am excited to announce that I am writing a book about the lessons that I have learned both in the music industry and in education, and I wanted to share these with you! My intention in writing this book has always been, and will always be, to help our keiki as they maneuver through their educational journeys. By sharing what I have learned and experi - enced after 35 years as a professional musician and over 20 years as an educator, I challenge them to look at education from a different perspec - tive: 1. GET YOUR EDUCATION FIRST a. Talent takes time to develop, from mimicking others at a young age, to creating your own sound. Open your mind to a world of new knowledge and skills. I say, \"follow your DREAMS and don't let anyone stop you.\" Why just have one dream? Most people love many things. Why not be a musician and an educator, an accountant, or a lawyer? Remember, success takes hard work, but it also takes a lot of luck too. By either going to school or having a day job, you are more likely to make decisions in the music business that are best for you. 2. MAKE YOUR OWN CHOICES a. Everyone will tell you what is wrong with you and your music, but you must remember that most opin - ions are coming from people who stand to benefit from the choices you make. You know what is best for yourself. Listen to what others say, reflect upon their words, and then make your own decisions. b. Remember that you are the only person that will have to live with the legacy you leave behind. c. Stay away from drugs, alcohol, etc. With the harsh environment faced when working long hours and traveling on the road for weeks or months at a time. The truth is that it ruins not only your life, but often the lives of your family mem - bers and friends who love you the most. 3. IT IS IMPORTANT TO BUILD COURAGE AND CONFIDENCE IN OUR STUDENTS a. Everyone is intelligent in their own way. We know through research on multi - ple intelligences by Howard Gardner of Harvard Uni - versity that the traditional measures of intelligence are logical and mathematical intelligence which makes for good lawyers, scientists, mathematicians and engineers, but there are so many other skills needed in the world we live in and that our students are naturally wired for. It is important for schools to expose students to these learning styles and provide them with opportunities to grow their respective \"intelligences.\" b. If students believe in themselves and value education, very little can stop them from experiencing success in school - regardless of their socio-economic status. 4. MASTERY OF CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS Expose students to diverse facts and opinions. With a world of information at the fingertips of students today, it is vital that they learn the skills needed to be able to distinguish between what is fact and simply opinion, and and to teach them to develop new and origi-nal thoughts while cementing what they've learned in their mind. By pro - viding our students with real-world problems to solve, we better prepare them for a future where, regardless of what kind of occupations are avail - able, they will be greatly needed. A hui hou k\u00e4kou until May, Trustee Leina'ala Ahu Isa LEO 'ELELE TRUSTEE | kwo@OHA.org NATIVE HAWAIIAN \u00bb NEWS | FEATURES | EVENTS Help for Native Hawaiian Businesses Facing the COVID Storm Keli'i Akina, Ph.D. Trustee, At-large It's been a full year of living in this global pandemic. As I reflect upon all that has hap - pened, I recognize a common denominator in all that has car - ried us through. Though our l\u00e4hui has faced many new challenges along with the rest of the world, we have surely met them with great resiliency and have taken the time, collectively, to stay grounded in what matters so much to us...'\u00e4ina. When all we have to rely on is ourselves, '\u00e4ina always has been, and always will be, our saving grace and balance. '\u00d6lelo no'eau 466 speaks to this and tells us, H\u00e4nau ka '\u00e4ina, h\u00e4nau ke ali'i, h\u00e4nau ke kanaka. Born was the land, born were the chiefs, born were the common people. Our k\u00fcpuna recognized that our K\u00e4naka and '\u00e4ina belong together. The impacts of COVID-19 over this last year have magni - fied the importance of our traditions and ways of life, our communities, our economics, and government systems that we live in today, echoing the words of many '\u00f6lelo no'eau which speak to our relationship to '\u00e4ina and this coexistence. We've seen individuals and entire commu - nities step up and 'auamo the kuleana to care for and help each other. With all the barriers of \"social distancing\" and \"limited contact,\" we are sharing infor - mation and engaging whenever and however we can to support each other on many levels. I've observed and worked alongside more hui coming together and organizing. I've witnessed and heard so many heartwarming stories during this time. More importantly, we are finding ways to feed each other. With food, with knowledge, with skills, through education and with '\u00e4ina at the core. We have up-and-coming lead - ers using their platforms for pono and sharing our stories in great capacities in communities, on the continent, and globally. Congress - man Kai Kahele recently spoke and brought further attention to '\u00f6lelo Hawai'i, openly sharing his kule - ana with the many hats he wears daily, never straying far from his roots and his aloha to his '\u00e4ina...our '\u00e4ina. What a great example and real testament of a modern, engaged, and progressive Kanaka. Here at home on Kaua'i, I am so blessed to see this '\u00e4ina aloha up close and personal, working and living alongside our fearless island people. Within this aloha for '\u00e4ina also come the tasks to maintain, operate, and protect our '\u00e4ina. Living wahi pana like our Hanap\u00ebp\u00eb Salt Ponds, Wai'oli, Hul\u00eb'ia, Kipu Kai, H\u00e4'ena, and many more are in need of the same fierce aloha we put into our people and practices. In other parts of the pae '\u00e4ina it is the same. In county and state arenas, plans for Wahi - aw\u00e4 and K\u00fckaniloko are a main focus, along with Kaka'ako Makai sparking big con - versation, the stoicism of Waimea Valley operations during this time, the management of Maunakea, all our Hawaiian Homelands, Public Land Trust lands, the list goes on. The value of our '\u00e4ina includes, but goes far beyond, monetary means - it is in who we are as K\u00e4naka. I hope to see an increase in efforts to further m\u00e4lama our '\u00e4ina. Let's keep our conversations going, raise our community engagement, and maintain our relationships on all levels. What's good for '\u00e4ina is good for k\u00e4naka, and what's good for k\u00e4naka is good for everyone. '\u00c4ina is the reason. M\u00e4lama pono! For the past year, the global COVID-19 pandemic has slowed most sectors of the world economy to a crawl. In Hawai'i, countless businesses have reached out for external help, such as government assistance, simply to survive. How - ever, recent survey data reveals that Native Hawaiian-owned businesses have largely weathered the storm of the last year on their own, without assistance from state or local gov - ernment programs. Citing U.S. Census data from 2012, a Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism (DBEDT) report shared that Native Hawaiians own 3,147 firms in Hawai'i, constituting 11.1% of all businesses in the state. In June 2020, OHA collaborated with Kamehameha Schools, Lili'uokalani Trust, the Hawai'i Leadership Forum, Kupu, and the Native Hawaiian Chamber of Commerce to survey over 2,000 residents, businessowners and nonprofit executives about COVID-19's impact on local businesses. Astonishingly, survey findings indicated that 46% of Native Hawaiian-owned businesses reported not requesting any financial assistance such as from the Paycheck Protection Program, Eco - nomic Injury Disaster Loans and other state or local government programs. Yet, many Hawaiian-owned businesses reported a decline in customer/client demand (53%), depletion in cash reserves (49%), event cancellations (34%) and temporary closures (48%). So what is the reason for the low utiliza - tion of financial assistance among Hawaiian business owners? Was it a lack of awareness, limited access to resource centers, or other barriers? Even the survey conductors are puzzled. In any case, the economic impact of COVID-19 remains with us, so it is essen - tial that Native Hawaiian-owned businesses utilize all available resources to survive and thrive at a new level. For example, CNHA and several local financial institutions are currently accepting applications for loans under the popular and well-known Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), created by the CARES Act. The federal government and many banking institutions rose to the challenge presented by the pandemic by offering zero-fee loans of up to $10 million to cover payroll and other operating expenses for cash- strapped small businesses. Eligible borrowers can seek to have PPP loan funds forgiven if spent on eli - gible overhead and payroll costs. Another tool available to small businesses is the Employee Retention tax credit (ERC) that was extended by the American Rescue Plan when it was signed into law on March 11, 2021. The refund - able Employee Retention tax credit (ERC) is now extended to cover wages paid out through June 30, 2021. The ERC is avail - able to employers whose business operations were fully or partially suspended due to gov - ernment-imposed restrictions on commerce, travel or group meetings, or employers whose businesses experienced significant losses in revenue compared with pre-pandemic peri-ods. Through the ERC, qualifying employers can claim any wages paid to employees in excess of amounts used for the PPP program. Native Hawaiian business owners should also be aware of OHA's M\u00e4lama Business and Hua Kanu Business Loan programs, pro - viding \"established small businesses access to credit and capital that allows them to grow.\" (https://loans.oha.org/business/) And all business owners will want to familiarize themselves with the resources highlighted by the Small Business Administration (www. sba.gov). Now, more than ever, it is vital to raise awareness of assistance that may be avail - able to small businesses. All of us who are fortunate enough to call Hawai'i home must walk together on the path to recovery, and that includes finding ways to support our local businesses. E Hana K\u00e4kou! Trustee Akina welcomes your comments and feedback at TRUSTEE Dan Ahuna Trustee, Lee Trustee, At-large LEO 'ELELE TRUSTEE MESSSAGES Federal Native Funding The week of April 4 is National Library Week. This makes me think of the fact that the King - dom of Hawai'i had close to a 95% literacy rate with over 70 Hawaiian language news - papers in publication. The Hawaiian Kingdom was the most literate country in the world. This was accomplished in less than 50 years by a native population with no Indigenous written language. Native Hawaiians' use of oli and mele helped to propel their learning curve in the written word and it was this fact that the missionar - ies used to help get the population literate. It was also this fact that the provisional gov - ernment of Hawai'i used to destabilize the native population after the overthrow. There is instance after instance of political leaders during this time period stating the way to \"Americanize\" the native population was to eliminate the Hawaiian language. Even former trustees from Bishop Estate had been known to agree with the sentiment that the way to keep Native Hawaiians compliant was to deny them their language. For nearly the first 80 years of Kamehameha Schools' existence, Hawaiian language was not even taught. With the Hawaiian renaissance of the 1970s came a resurgence of the Hawaiian language. The birth of P\u00fcnana Leo, followed by the Hawaiian immersion programs and eventually Native Hawaiian Public Charter Schools, have all helped to normalize the once nearly extinct language. When I graduated from Kamehameha in 1987 few students took Hawaiian as their language requirement. Today you can hear our '\u00f6lelo makuahine throughout the halls on campus. While the Office of Hawaiian Affairs provides substantial funding for Native Hawaiian Public Charter Schools, it is the United States Congress that provides the majority of funding through the Native Hawaiian Education Act. This act needs to be reauthorized by Congress regularly as, unlike Native Americans or Alaskan Natives whose funding is guaran - teed through the Indian Education Act, Native Hawaiians are not rec - ognized as an Indigenous people of the United States. This is where the term that has so much friction behind it comes from: \"federal rec - ognition.\" The irony of this is those Indigenous peo - ples whose educational funding is protected by their recognized status by the federal government are looking to Native Hawai - ians and how we have not only brought our language back but that it is now thriving. The other irony behind \"federal recognition\" is that many Native Hawaiians are against it because they believe that the Kingdom of Hawai'i is being illegally occupied by the United States of America. This is ironic because they believe this is a \"fake state.\" If the United States left Hawaiian shores tomorrow, why would recognition as an Indigenous people matter? It would not. How would being recognized by the United States prevent Native Hawaiians from continuing to seek its independence? It would not. What does the Native Hawaiian people being rec-ognized as an Indigenous people have to do with the Kingdom of Hawai'i? Nothing. Did you have to be Native Hawaiian to be a citizen in the Kingdom of Hawai'i? No, you did not. While we continue to have these con - versations about whether to be federally recognized or not, I am grateful for our con - gressional team in Washington, D.C., that continues to fight for the reauthorization of the Native Hawaiian Education Act, Health Act, and other federal programs, and the continued appropriation of funds for these programs to help Native Hawaiians. Mahalo senators Hirono and Schatz and congress - men Case and Kahele.

Hawai'i County Council Resolution 640-18 requested that HBGN consult with the communities impacted by the eruption to ensure that traditional, cul - tural, and family ties were considered in order to establish appropriate names for the Fissure 8 vent and any other features of the 2018 eruption. Mayor Mitch Roth said, \"We are excited to have a name that provides a sense of place, history, and cultural identity to the fissure that took with it so many memories.

Community Voices Call for Bold Policy Leadership The '\u00c4ina Aloha Economic Futures (AAEF) initiative is launching a policy playbook, Growing a Stronger Hawai'i, that outlines key approaches to transforming Hawai'i's economy. The playbook makes 26 specific proposals which collectively estab - lish a framework for a resilient and diverse economy. The policy propos - als are grounded in shared values and prioritize the wellbeing of communi - ties and our natural environment in a post-pandemic future. AAEF co-author, Dr. Noe Noe Wong-Wilson said, \"When the pan - demic hit, we quickly realized that our grassroots communities were not represented in discussions of economic recovery. We saw that the pre-pan - demic economy was not working for a large portion of our community. And we knew it was urgent to amplify the voices of the many individuals and organizations that could bring invalu - able expertise to these discussions.\" The playbook was developed through a series of engagements that involved over 2,750 individuals, organizations and businessess and produced over 180 specific proposals. \"At the midpoint of the legislative session, we are very concerned that decision-makers are going to revert to what they know - the pre-pandemic status quo - and that is a huge problem. The status quo has failed to provide social and environmental justice and equity in our community. It's time for our policymakers to make these changes now,\" said Wong-Wilson.

OHA recognizes these foundations have the power to affect the wellbeing of Native Hawaiians. Therefore, they are woven into OHA's plans to affect change in the areas of education, health, housing, and economics. These four directions will be used to guide OHA's work to better the conditions of Native Hawaiians. Over the next 15 years, OHA will be implementing strategies aligned with our foundations and directions to achieve our envisioned outcomes for a thriving and abundant lhui. 'Ohana is represented here with 'ulu (bread - fruit). According to mo'olelo, the god K fell in love with a human woman. He married her and together they raised a family until a time of terrible famine. Driven by love for his 'ohana, K transformed himself into an 'ulu tree so they would not starve. That was the first 'ulu tree; all 'ulu trees are descended from K.In the time before, our kpuna had no written language. The 'ike and mo'olelo of our people were passed from one generation to the next through oli and hula. Palapalai was one of the plants kapu to Laka, the goddess of hula. Palapalai is often worn by dancers or used to adorn the hula kuahu (altar). Because of this connection, it has been chosen to represent culture.According to tradition, Wkea and Ho'ohkka- lani had a stillborn son they named Hloa. The grieving parents buried their child and from that spot the first kalo plant began to grow. They later had another, healthy boy, who they also named Hloa. He became the first Hawaiian, and thus, kalo is considered the older brother of the Ha- waiian people. Today, Kalo has become a modern symbol of mlama 'ina. In traditional times, the oily kernal of the kukui nut was used for lamps. Indeed, \"kukui\" also means lamp, light or torch, and because of this, the kukui tree has long been a symbol of enlightenment. Education is a path towards enlightenment; acquiring 'ike (knowledge) and no'eau (wisdom), learning to think critically and to apply what is learned - these skills are critical to moving our lhui forward.Noni is a \"canoe plant\" brought to Hawai'i from the South Pacific by the earliest Hawaiian voyagers specifically for its numerous medicinal properties. While its taste and smell are rather unpleasant, noni was known to boost the immune system and to purify the blood. It was used to treat diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and as a poultice to treat various skin diseases. As beautiful as they are strong, 'hia lehua are the first trees able to grow on barren lava fields and reclaim the land. It is a dominant tree of the Hawaiian rainforest, and considered a manifestation of the god, K. While the tree's delicate blossoms and liko (leaf buds) are used to fashion lei, 'hia wood is exceptionally hard and was used traditionally for many purposes, such as framing houses.Pure, fresh water (wai) is the essence and source of all life. The word \"wai\" also means to retain, leave or earn, while \"waiwai\" means wealth, emphasizing the value of water. Our kpuna understood that this pre-cious resource was a gift to be carefully managed and shared. Wai flowed down from upland rainforests, nourishing the lands below which led to abudance and prosperity that enriched the entire community. Zweng DEA Appendices Page 176 of 317E ala! Join Hands!Hands! A call to come together to tackle a given task. - 'lelo No'eau Mana i Mauli Ola, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs' strate - gic plan for 2020-2035, sets the organization's focus for the next 15 years. OHA believes that Native Hawaiians should determine the work that is needed in their own communities, and how their resources should be applied to advance that work. Trustees, staff members and community stake - holders were engaged in the strategic planning process and the collective feedback was essen - tial in the development of the plan. In May and June of 2019, OHA held eight community focus groups across the islands to share about the strategic planning process and gather community input on areas of greatest need. An extensive statewide media campaign utilized radio, tv, print and social media advertising and interviews to encourage beneficiaries and collaborators to attend the community focus groups in person, or provide mana'o via an online survey. All community feedback was compiled and presented to the Board of Trustees, helping to inform the design and integration of the stra - tegic foundations and directions of the new strategic plan. Despite the continuing impacts of COVID- 19, in September 2020, the Board of Trustees affirmed the strategic foundations and direc - tions and approved reworded strategies and outcomes. OHA would like to extend a sincere mahalo nui loa to the hundreds of individuals who took the time to participate and share their mana'o in setting the future direction of the organization. It is OHA's hope that the collaborative pro- cess that informed Mana i Mauli Ola honors the voices of our beneficiaries and communi - ties, and moves us toward an abundant and thriving lhui.Our MissionOur Mission Our VisionOur Vision ADVOCATEMana i Mauli OlaMana Mauli Ola OHA 's 15-YEAR STRATEGIC PLAN FOR 2020-2035 Our RolesOur Roles RESEARCHER ASSET MANAGER COMMUNITY ENGAGERTo mlama Hawai'i's people and environmental resources, and OHA's assets, toward ensuring the perpetuation of the culture, the enhancement of lifestyle and the protection of entitle-ments of Native Hawaiians, while enabling the building of a strong and healthy Hawaiian people and lhui, recognized nationally and internationally.Ho'oulu Lhui Aloha OHA's vision statement (To Raise a Beloved Lhui) blends the thoughts and leadership of both King Kalkaua and his sister, Queen Lili'uokalani. Both faced tumultuous times as we do today, and met their challenges head on. \"Ho'oulu Lhui\" was King Kalkaua's motto. Aloha expresses the high values of Queen Lili'uokalani. As an advocate, OHA speaks, writes and acts in favor of effective policy development, including changing of laws and strengthening implementation of policies and practices that impact the foundations and directions outlined in the organization's strategic plan. Advocates also monitor and evaluate policies and garner public support for causes through community outreach efforts, identifying potentially harmful or ineffective policies and laws, and supporting initiatives that enable communities to advocate to improve the conditions for Native Hawaiians. As an asset manager, OHA makes mindful investment decisions that help maximize the value of the organization's portfolio. These fiduciary duties and responsibilities include managing financial, land, and community property assets prudently, and preserving and perpetuating legacy land holdings.As a researcher, OHA serves by gath- ering, compiling and analyzing data that identifies issues important to the Native Hawaiian community including policies and practices, making observations and recommendations, informing the organization and communities' advocacy efforts, evaluating policies, programs and practices, providing and ensuring that the actions and initiatives undertaken inform actions by OHA, beneficiaries and communities as a whole. As a community engager, OHA works collaboratively with the Native Hawaiian community and general public by sharing in- formation through multiple communication channels that connect the organization with beneficiaries, communities and networks.

Based on representations by the landowner Paul Zweng and consultants Townscape, Inc, it is our understanding that this particular CDUA is strictly to allow for a single family residence to house the landowner's and his family and that the potential for applying for said residence encompasses both TMKs described. As stated by the applicant, the combined TMKs are considered as a single property by the State Department of Land & Natural Resources and only one residence can be considered. The property, including both TMKs, has a State Land Use Designation of Conservation and, within that designation, is under the \"Resource Subzone\" which allows for agro forestry such as the Cacao farm that Mr . Zweng envisions, along with forest preservation under the hulehule Forest Conservancy. In addition to community-based discussion(s) that have taken place in consideration of this request, both with the proponent and Townscape as well as separately - among community participants in association meetings, the Steering Committee would also like to acknowledge receipt of recent communication provided by Lilie Makaila of Townscape to the Kahalu'u Neighborhood Board (the NB includes representation of Sub-Area 1, the Waiahole-Kualoa area). That letter, dated June 3, 2021, has been shared among Steering Committee members. In general, the Committee stands on past support - in concept - of this application for a single family residence. Paul Zweng has been an active, participating member of the Waiahole-Waikane community at large, while pursuing forest conservancy for this special area for over ten years; at the same time, he has also actively participated in community meetings as a member of the Steering Committee, an associate WWCA Community Association member and participant in community events and projects. Zweng DEA Appendices Page 283 of 317(Continue) Zweng's acquisition of the ~1400 acres in Waikanae, in many ways, was welcomed with hopes that the area's traditional, cultural and natural resource values might finally gain some support and protection - values long ignored and/or desecrated by private property \"ownership\" and inappropriate development schemes, mis-use by the military during war years (and failure to address promised restoration) and battles over precious water and watershed resources therein. The work of the hulehule Forest Conservancy has been commendable. Its stated \"long-term vision\" for controlled access (and, hopefully, re-building of essential roads and trails), \"restoration of the historic taro flats'', together with removal of invasive plants and replacement with native are very much in keeping with our valleys' dreams of long-term stewardship. The above said, our continuing concern(s) relate, primarily, to the very long struggle of protecting the above-mentioned values for our \"two green valleys\" of Waiahole & Waikane in perpetuity!. Our support for this CDUA, in concept, does not negate our larger concern for the protection and development of the means to accomplish this. We are well aware that the Conservation designation and/or County-level zoning can help to hold off development attempts such as this community has faced in the past - developments that have taxed our residents and farmers as major distractions and stresses to our daily interests. We are equally aware of that and have witnessed past ef forts to change such designations and zoning. T o this end, our \"support\" for this CDUA is predicated on the desire to see this major land-holding and its current landowner/consultants explore real methods of conservation, in perpetuity, analyzing - for the community's benefit - the feasibility of utilizing tools such as Conservation or Agricultural \"easements'' and funding sources for same. In this way, together, our respective hopes and dreams will be honored and realized. No one resident, farmer, land owner or lessee gets to live \"forever\", but a dream can. Our association, largely comprised of \"tenants' ', has no intention of allowing the community to be a temporary occupant. We have always planned to be here in perpetuity and will continue to push for a commitment to be the same with all who pass through as fellow stewards.

As a result, our clients are saving over $25 million in utility expenses annually. With the the best product and workmanship warranties in the industry, our clients have peace of mind. Come see, touch and learn about the latest Smart Home technologies at our Innovation Center. We hope you'll choose us to do your next home project. We contacted RevoluSun because of their great reputation and because they installed PV for one of our friends. We were not disappointed. Our sales person took the time to understand our needs and design a custom PV system with Tesla Powerwalls under Hawaiian Electric's self supply program. He helped us understand the benefits, tax incentives and how much money we could still save by going solar. We especially love the battery back-up capabilities and knowing we don't have to worry about power outages anymore. Our installation team was great and we are very happy. It's also nice to know they can help us with roofing work in the future, and we're already thinking about having them install AC for us now that we have PV to power it! - Traci M., Hawaii Kai We tested the products, so you don't have to Your home is likely the largest investment you'll ever make, and how it performs affects both your family and your finances.

Join the Revolusun Apples to Apples? It's hard to get a true comparison when evaluating proposals for PV and storage systems. Here are a few important details to keep in mind. Design - RevoluSun Project Developers have been certified by the leading manufacturers for PV and Storage solutions. Project Managers have 'Advanced' and 'Master' Design and Installation certifications and various team members are North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP) accredited (the solar industry's gold standard). PV Panels - Not all PV panels are created equally and a \"watt\" in a laboratory is not necessarily the same \"watt\" in real life. Revolusun installs PV panels that perform better in real world conditions including high temperatures and low light. These panels also carry much better manufacturer's warranties, guaranteeing as much as 92% power production over 25 years. What's more, unlike other modules that only warranty the actual product for 10 years, these modules carry a 25-year power AND product warranty. When comparing PV panels, make sure you understand the difference between power production and product warranties and what's included (or NOT included). Storage - The addition of battery storage technology to PV systems provides exciting new features for PV system owners. However, not all storage solutions provide the same functionality like whole home back-up in the event of a power outage. What's more, the strength and stability of the manufacturer will be important in the future. During the original PV boom, consolidation in panel manufacturers left many homeowners without the equipment warranties they were promised. Revolusun works with the leading manufacturers with superior technology that will be here for the long haul. Respect Your Roof - During the PV installation process, holes are drilled through your roof and into rafters to attach PV equipment. The consequences of a poor installation can be severe. Revolusun uses hurricane rated stainless steel bolts and roof specific waterproofing techniques to protect roof penetrations for the life of your PV system. We also employ a 6000 series aluminum racking structure that won't rust and will limit the number of roof penetrations necessary, while also providing a more secure and structurally sound attachment for panels. Revolusun is a Certainteed certified installer and Certainteed 5-star roofing contractor. This means our installation techniques have the approval of one of the world's largest roofing manufacturers and our installations will not void their roofing material warranty. Partner For the Future - RevoluSun has been a leading PV installer in Hawaii since 2009 and has helped more than 7,000 homeowners make the switch to clean, renewable energy. While the maturation of Hawaii's solar industry has, unfortunately, left many PV system owners without an installation warranty or support for their systems, RevoluSun customers can rest assured. RevoluSun expanded its capabilities to include HVAC, roofing, natural lighting, water heating and home security and automation. This holistic approach to home performance provides benefits to customers in two ways: one, they have a trusted partner able to complete many types of home improvement projects and two, diversification provides RevoluSun the business stability needed to be around for years to come.
