Description of the herbal substance(s), herbal preparation(s) or combinations thereof flower (Malvae sylvestris flos) the whole or fragmented dried flower of Malva sylvestris L. or its cultivated varieties. The flower consists of an epicalyx with 3 oblong or elliptical- lanceolate parts that are shorter than those of the calyx and situated immediately below it ; a calyx with 5 pubescent triangular lobes, gamosepalous at the bas e; a corolla 3 -4 times longer than the calyx with 5 wedge- shaped, notched petals fused to the staminal tube at their base; numerous stamens, the filaments of which fuse into a staminal tube covered by small star-shaped trichomes and occasional simple omes visible sometimes pubescent, encosed in the staminal tube and arranged into a circe around a central style ending with numerous filiform stigmas. In cultivated varieties, the epicalyx is 3 -7 parti te, the calyx 5 -8 partite and the corolla 5 -10 partite. (European Pharmacopoeia edition, 1541) Malva sylvestris L., species, folium Mallow leaf (Malvae folium) represents whole or fragmented, dried leaf of Mal va sylvestris L., Malva neglecta Wallr. or a mixture of both species. The leaves of M. sylvestris are up to 12 cm long and up to 15 cm wide with 3, 5 or 7 lobes and sinuate at the base; the leaves of M. neglecta are up to 9 cm long and wide, round or kidney -shaped with 5- 7 indistinct lobes. The leaves of both species have irregular dentate margins and are green or brownish - green. The abaxial surface of the lamina bears more hairs and shows a more prominent venation than the adaxial surface. The major veins on the upper surface of the leaves and the petioles may be violet. The petioles are as long as the leaves, up to 2 mm wide, rounded and somewhat tlattened, longitudinally slightly grooved, green or brownish -green or violet. The fragmented drug consists of occasionally agglomerated, crumpled pieces of leaves showing prominent veins. (European Pharmacopoeia 9th edition, 2391) Herbal preparation(s) Malvae sylvestris flos.

Not applicable. Malva sylvestris is native to Europe, North Africa, and Asia, and its traditional use has been documented since a long- time ago, although little clinical evidence is available (Barros et al . 2010). Another species distributed in the same regions is the neglected mallow ( M. neglecta ) which is also used as a source of leaves for medical purposes. In ancient times, the plant was used by the Greeks and Romans for its emollient and laxatives properties. In current medical practice M. sylvestris is used in a variety of inflammatory conditions. In the Mediterranean area, young leaves and stems are eaten in soups and salads either as raw or as cooked vegetables. Malva sylvestris is characterized by a high content of mucus consisting of polysaccharides. Besides use in inflammation of the mouth and throat when is applied in a form of infusions, decoctions as a herbal tea or a gargle, cutaneous use for treatment of cuts, infected wounds and skin burns in a form of poultices and lotions is described in literature. (Barros et al . 2010). The following substances were found in Malvae sylvestris flowers: Mucilage polysaccharides The basic structural unit of polysaccharides consisting of glucose, galactose and rhamnose occurs in different proportions in both flowers and leaves of Malva sylvestris . It appears that high molecular weight acid polysaccharides are responsible for the viscosity and increase of the swelling index in aqueous solutions. About 10% of mucilage is present in flowers. Classen and Blaschek (1998) in: Flores (2011), apek (1992), apek and Kardoova (1995) and apek et al. (1999) isolated four polysaccharides from the flowers of Malva sylvestris L. spp: a linear neutral polysaccharide, a branched neutral polysaccharide, high molecular weight acid polysaccharides and a very branched acidic polysaccharide. The molecular weight of the high molecular weight acidic polysaccharide was in the range of 1.6 x10 6 Da. They consisted mainly of glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, rhamnose and galactose. The amount of uronic acids in the dry weight: galacturonic and glucuronic is much higher in flowers, where it accounts for 22.8% than in leaves (8.2%) of Malva sylvestris. apek et al. (1999) isolated from Malva sylvestris sp. mauritiana a neutral heteropolysaccharide wit h relative molecular weight 3.71 x 106. It consisted of the dominant compound L -rhamnose (42%) followed by L -arabinose (34.3%), D -galactose (23.4%) and traces of D -mannose, D -xylose and L - fucose. The investigations indicated a branched structure of the polysaccharide with 3,6 -linked D - galactopyranose, 5 -linked L -arabinofuranose as well as 4 -linked and terminal L -rhamnopyranose residues as the main building units. Hydrolysis of the mucus polysaccharides results in the release of neutral sugars: glucose, arab inose, xylose and rhamnose. (H\u00e4nsel from 0.42 to 7.3% of dry matter (Farina et al. . al . et al the main flavonols in M. sylvestris identified by Barros et al. (2012). Additionally, caffeoylquinic acid, quercetin acetyldihexoside, luteolin -, apigenin - and well as kaempferol hexoside and kaempferol acetylhexoside were found Malvae sylvestris pelargonic acid, stearic acid, -linolenic acid (Loizzo et al. 2016). Other organic acids Other organic acids found by Pereira et al. (2013) - 0.039% (w/w) of essential oil was obtained from dried f lowers containing 143 volatile compounds. The essential oil consisted mainly of hyd rocarbons (2 main component s found were hexadecanoic acid, . 2013) Carotenoids et Redi et al. 2005) A and B (Redi et al. 2005) Tocopherols (Barros et al. 2010) The followi ng substances were found in Malvae sylvestris leaves: Mucilage polysaccharides The leaves of Malva sylvestris contain about 6 to 8% of mucilage according to Wichtl (2004) and PDR (2000). High molecular weight acidic polysaccharides located in epidermal ce lls of the leaves were found to be of the rhamnogalacturonan type. The weight of the high molecular weight acid polysaccharides of leaves of Malva sylvestris is 1.38 x 106 Da with the same basic structural unit consisting of glucose, galactose and rhamnose as in flowers (Classen and Blaschek 1998, in Flores 2011). A mucilage was isolated from the fresh leaves of Malva sylvestris MILL. var . mauritiana in which main constituent is acidic polysaccharide with molecular weight about 6.0x10 6. Quantitative analyse s showed that this polysaccharide was composed of 94.4 % polysaccharide and 5 % peptide moieties. The polysaccharide contained 40 % L -rhamnose, 22.2 % D -galactose, 16 % D -galacturonic acid and 16 % D-glucuronic acid in the molar ratio 6:3:2:2 (Tomoda et al ., 1989). Samavati and crude polysaccharides from the leaves of Malva sylvestris. The experimental yield of polysaccharides was 8.38\u00b10.38%. Gonda et al . (1990) isolated from the leaves of Malva sylvestris. L, var. mauritiana Mill. an acidic polysaccharide with molecular weight of 11 000, composed of L - rhamnose, D -galactose, D -galacturonic acid, and D -glucuronic acid in the molar ratio of 22:6:22:11 and containing 7.7 % peptide. Other constituents Phenolic derivatives The to tal phenolic compounds were found to be 386.5 mg/g in the leaves (Barros et a l. 2010). Polyphenols Presence of the following polyphenols is reported in the literature sources: 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid, 4 methoxybenzoic acid, 4 -hydroxy- 3-methoxybenzoic acid, 2 -hydroxybenzoic acid, 4 -hydroxy- 2 methoxybenzoic acid, 4 -hydroxybenzyl alcohol, 4 - hydroxydi hydrocinnamic acid, 4 -hydroxy- 3 acid, 4 acid and tyrosol (Cutillo et al . 2006), chlorogenic acid (in herb - Terninko et al. 2014). Flavonoids The presence of gossypetin 3- sulphate -8-O--D-glucoside(gossypin) an d hypolaetin 3 - sulphate as the major constituents, followed by hypolaetin 4 -methyl ether 8- O-D-glucuronopyranoside, hypolaetin was (Billeter et al 1991, Luteolin, et 2014). Quercetin, kampferol and myricetin was identified by Alesiani et and Onishcenko, 2013 . (2014), 5,7- Alesiani (2007) and 7- hydroxy- 6-methoxycoumarin (scopoletin) by Tosi et al.

Information on documented medicinal use and historical data from literature There is an evidence of the use of Malva sylvestris for the past thousand years in Europe (Gasparetto et al. 2012; Prudente Goetz 2016). Malva sylvestris remains together with remains of other medicinal plants have been found through archaeological research among the oldest Central European inhabitants - living in Lower Saxony more than 6000 years ago (Dieck 1985) . The medicinal use of Malva sylvestris leave s and flowers has been documented continuously in several pharmacopoeias: the first information about mallow flowers in Poland are included in Materia Assessment report on Malva as flores mucilaginei. Also in the pharmaceutical lexicon published at the turn of the 19th and 20th century flowers of Malva sylvestris are listed (Wiorog\u00f3rski and Zajczkowski 1892 sylvestris\" is DAB 1947, common mallow flowers and leaves. Malvae folium and flos was in the in theCzechoslovak edition 1947, Austrian Pharmac opoeia and mallow leaf (2391). Mallow is traditionally used due to a high mucilage content for treatment of the symptoms of oral or pharyngeal irritations, associated dry cough and gastrointestinal discomfort. In current folk medical practice in Italy Malva sylvestris use is popular , where comes a large number of ethnobotanical information from. It is one of the most important medicinal species in the Italian \"folk pharmacopoeia\". In a local saying is told that: \" La malva, da ogni mal'ti salva\" (the mallow saves you from every disease). So, decoctions of the leaves are used locally in inflammation of the mouth in the region of the northern Italian Ligurian Alps (Cornara et al. 2014). In Valvestino, near Lake Garda also the frequent use of Malva neglecta was notified (Vitalini et al . 2009). use both sylvestris recorded decoction on wounds and sores (Vitalini et al . 2015). In central Italy, decoctions of aerial parts are used as a laxative and topically applied to the cheek or directly into aching teeth (Guarrera et al . 2005). In the central Appenine area Malva sylvestris leaves, flowers and whole aerial parts are used in bronchitis, sore throat and cough. Aerial parts are applied to aching teeth as analgesic and as a mouthwash (Idolo et al . 2010). In Abruzzo, the plant leaves and flowers are used as emollient, expectorant, diuretic and mild laxative for children (Leporatti and Corradi 2001). In Campania, both aerial parts and leaves are used in throat inflammation, bronchitis and cough (Di Novella et al Muoio 2014; In southern Italy in Basilicata Region decoctions of aerial flowering parts are used as a mild laxative, against flu, cold and stomach ache (Montesano et al. 2012; Quave et a l. 2008). In the south of Italy, in the region of Calabria mallow leaves and flowers in infusions and decoctions are used both locally and systemically in mouth inflammation, toothache as mouthwashes, gargles and as a laxat ive (Leporatti and Impieri 2007; Passalacqua et al . 2007). Also in Sicily and in Sardinia Malva sylvestris flowers and leaves are used in folk traditional medicine as herbal tea for digestive and antiinflammatory therapy and in gingivitis and toothache (Le to et al. 2013; Leonti et al . 2009; Tuttolomondo et et al. 2009). In Spain Malva sylvestris flowers, leaves and whole aerial parts are applied directly topically, often without pharmaceutical forms as poultice or to prepare bath as anti pruritic and external antiseptic treatment (Rigat et al . 2015). The plant can cure wounds and inflammations and is used as an analgesic, but also as a herbal tea for respiratory problems and stomach ache (Calvo et al . 2011, 2015; Gonz\u00e1lez et al In Portugal, both Malva sylvestris and Malva neglecta flowers and leaves are used as herbal tea systemically and topically as an anti inflammatory, antiseptic and antiodontalgic treatment (Novais et al . 2004). In Bosnia -Hercegovina Malva sylvestri s herbal tea of leaves and flowers is used orally in common cold, dry cough and croakiness, cough, pulmonary ailments, gastrointestinal spasms and painfull urination et al. 2010). In Serbia, mallow leaves and flowers are topically applied a s poultices on wounds and ulcers difficult to heal Jari et al. 2015). Table 2: Overview of historical data.

Primary pharmacodynamics Antitussive effects Flowers In vivo experiment Mucilage and acidic polysaccharide fraction In experiments performed by Nosalova et al . (1994) a mucilage and acidic polysaccharide fraction (consisting of rhamnogalacturonan) isolated from mallow flowers ( Malva mauritiana) were administered orally to cats at a dose of 50 mg / kg (without anesthesia). Antitussive effect of the polysaccharides was evaluated by surgically implanted chronic endotracheal cannula into the trachea. It served not on ly to register the pressure on electromanometr but also to the irritation of the airway mucous membrane in the desired areas: laryngopharyngeal and tracheobronchial. These areas were five times stimulated mechanically with nylon fiber and then monitored pr ior to application of the tested substance as a control value and after 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 hours after the administration of the polysaccharides. Both mucilage and rhamnogalacturonan fraction significantly diminished the number of incidents of cough and its intensity (during inhalation and exhalation). Mucilage decreased frequency of cough, mostly in the laryngopharyngeal area, while the fraction of rhamnogalacturonan (50 mg/kg. b. w.) was effective in both areas, also in the trachea and bronchi and resulted i n antitussive effects 15% higher than that of the mucilage. Moreover, only a rhamnogalacturonian fraction had an inhibitory effect on the maximum intensity of coughing. The effects of the application of mucilage rhamnogalacturonan fraction and reduction of the number of cough events were compared with the Assessment report on Malva sylvestris L. narcotic drug and codeine phosphate (10 mg/kg). Both mucilage substances of Malva sylvestris origin have had greater inhibitory activity than prenoxdiazine and dropropizine but less than codeine. Depression of respiratory activity, typical of narcotic antitussive drugs was not notified during the experiments with Malva sylvestris mucil aginous substances. Antiinflammatory effects Flowers In vitro experiments Water extract Seiberg et al. (2006) patented the method of enhancing production of the mucus compri sing administering to mucosal tissue effective amount of the water extrac ts of Malvae sylvestris flower. Authors described the effects of the extract on cell cultures tran siently transfected the elastin promoter -luciferase reporter construct, driving the firefly luciferase g ene. The extracts were added to the transfected cells and we re incubated for 48 hours. An increase i n elastin promoter activity was observed in the presence of increasing doses of the extract (2,5% an d 5%), as compared to untreated cells enhancing elastine production. Protection from metalloproteinase degradation w as also investigate d: Matrix Metalloproteinase -12, (MMP- 12), also named human macrophage elastase activity was inhibited by Malva sylvestris extract in a dose dependent manner. The concentration of the Malvae sylvestris extract as low as 0.6% resulted in approximately 23% reduction in MMP -122 activity, while 5% of extrac t inhibited MMP -12 activity for 80%. This shows that Malva sylvestris flowers extract can protect elastin fiber s from damage and degradation (Seiberg et al . 2006). In vivo experiment Hydro-alcoholic extract Nasiri et al. (2015) studied activity of topical application of Malvae sylve stris flowers ethanolic extract on second degree burn injury and wounds in rats. Ethanol (70%) wa s added to the powdered flowers and hydro alcoholic extract of herbal flowers and afterwards was dried to a powder to yield of 9.68% w/w. In experiment 5% and 10% Malvae sylvestris saline (control) and standard silver sulfadiazine 1% (SSD) were used in rats burned wi th hot metal plate. Wound are a, percentage of wound contraction, and histological and bacteriological assessments were evaluated. M. sylvestris cream significantly improved histological changes of tissue c omponents in the process of healing when compared with silver sulfadiazine cream. In vivo experiment Water extract Afshar et al. (2015) investigated the effects of topical administration of the Malva sylvestris, flowers aqueous extract on cutaneous wound healing in BALB/c mice. Experim ental ani mals were divided into three groups: the first, second and third group received topical administration of M. sylvestris 1% water extract in cream, silver sulfadiazine topical cream and cold cream (positive and negati ve control Assessment report on Malva 20/38 groups), respectively. On day s 4, 7 and 10 wound healing was evalua ted histopathologically. On the tenth day of the experiment, the Malva sylvestris treated mice showed significantly less fibrosis, less scar formation, and fewer hair follicles damage. The number of inflammatory cells in M. sylvestris and silver sulfadiazine treated groups were significantly lower than in the control group. Leaves In vitro experiment Ethanolic extract Ethanolic extract (1:6 w/v) of dried leaves of Malva sylvestris was tested for anti- inflammatory activity by Martins et al . (2014). In desferrioxamine- stimulated phorbol 12- myristate 13 -acetate -differentiated culture of U937 cells influence of the M. sylvestris extract on release of the pro -inflammatory mediators prostaglandins PGE2 and PGD2 was measured. They mediate acute and chronic inflammatory responses associated with vasodilatation, fever, pa in, and edema. U937- d cells are estimated as an appropriate model to mimic the oral cavity inflammations, against which M. sylvestris is mainly used. U937- d cells were treated with M. sylvestris ethanolic extract at 10.0 and 50.0 g/mL. A significant -dependent reduction of o The anti-inflammatory activity attributed to M. sylvestris may b e dependent on the reduction of prostaglandins as pro -inflammatory mediators In vitro experiment Ethanolic, chloroform and ethyl acetate extracts Benso et al. (2015) investigated anti -inflammatory activity of Malva sylvestris extracts in the model mimicking the periodontal structure infected by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. An in vitro dual-chamber model to mimic the periodontal structure was dev eloped, using a monolayer of epithelial keratinocytes and a subepithelial layer of fibroblasts. The periodontopathogen A. actinomycetemcomitans was applied to migrate through the cell lay ers and induce the synthesis of immune factors and cytokines in the h ost cells. Ethanolic (absolute etha nol) extract (1:8) (MSE) of the leaves of Malva sylvestris was partitioned using liquid -liquid extract ion with hexane, chloroform and ethyl acetate. The final residue obtained after ethyl acetate fractionation was totally soluble in water and thus was called the aqueous fraction (AF). The extract (MSE), chloroform fraction (CLF) and aqueous fraction were resuspended in 1% ethanol and used in the biological assays. The extract minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 175 g/mL, minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) chloroform fraction (MIC g/mL, MBC 250 g/mL) were found that both MSE and CLF had inhib itory influence on the all four microorganisms tested. Chloroform fraction (CLF) was the most potent, and most effective in reducing the bacterial colonization (p< 0.05) with a MIC against A. actinomycetemcomitans of 150 g/mL, a MIC against F. nucleatum of 500 g/mL and a MIC against P. intermedia of 125 g/mL. The MSE had Assessment report on lowest MIC against P. gingivalis (15.6 g/ml compared to the positive control 10 g/mL). Moreover, chloroform fraction promoted the down -regulation -1beta, IL -6, IL-10, CD14, PTGS, MMP- 1 and FOS as well as the reduction of the IL -1beta, IL -6, IL-8 and GM -CSF protein levels (p< 0.05). In vivo experiment Water extract Chiclana et al. (2009) studied topical antiinflammatory activity of Malva sylvestris L. leaves water extract on carragenin -induced hind paw oedema in rats. A decoction was prepared from 50 g of mallow leaves yielding extract 50%. From this extract creams were prepared at 5, 10 and 20% v/w of the extract as a water -soluble cream base. A significative inhibition of edema was obtained with the 5% malva cream compared to placebo, and the effect of malva was higher than that of a 2% indomethacin cream. In vivo experiment Hydro -alcoholic extract Prudente et al. (2013) investigated the topical anti -inflammatory action of the hydroalcoholic extract of M. sylvestris leaves in vivo on a 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- acetate (TPA)- induced mous e ear oedema model in mice. Oedema was induced on the right ear by topical a pplication of 2.5 g/ear of TPA dissolved in 20 l of acetone. Hydroalcoholic extract of dexamethasone (0.05 mg/ear) which was used as a positive control. Th e extracts were dissolved in 2 l of acetone and topically applied immediately after TPA. The thickness of the ears was measured before and 6 h after induction of inflammation. Topical application of Malvae sylvestris hydroalcoholic extract inhibited ear inflammation and polymorphonuclear cells influx (myeloperoxydase activity) and interleukin -1b levels in the tissues. Malvidin 3 -glucoside was also able to inhibit ear oedema and leukocytes. The oedema reduction induced by the Malvae sylvestris extract exhibited a mean ID 50 value of 0.36 (0.14- 0.90) mg/ ear, with mg/e ar), while malvidin 3 -glucoside caused reduction in oedema of 90 \u00b1 3% (0.2 mol/ear) and an ID 50 value of 0.003 (0.002 -0.004) mol/ear. The extract inhibited TPA increase of myeloperoxydase ac tivity in a dose depend ent way: ID50 = 0.46 (0.3 - 0.7) mg/ear and with inhibition of 73 \u00b1 1% (3 Malvidin a reduction of 70 \u00b1 5% of MPO in the tissue. The increase in the level of IL -1 in the ear was inhibited in a dose dependent manner by topical application of hydroalcoholic extract from Malva sylvestris , presenting a mean ID 50 value of 0.96 (0.92- 1.0) mg/ear and 74.2% of The inhibitory activity of dexamet hasone was similar. The authors conclude that hydroalcoholic extract from Malva sylvestris induces strong anti -inflammatory activity and probably malvidin 3 -glucoside is responsible for this effects. In vivo and in vitro experiments Water extract El Ghaoui et a l. (2008) studied the influence water extract of Malva sylvestris leaves on antibody production in mice immunized with egg albumin. The effect of this e xtract on interleukin -4 (IL-4), interleukin -12 (IL -12) and -interferon gene transcriptio n were investi gated. The extract was prepared Assessment report on Malva L. 22/38 by by heating in distilled water until boiling and left to cool at room temperature. The decoction was filtered and lyophilized and 50 mg/mL solution was reconstitute d using distilled water. Malvae sylvestris extract had no effect on anti egg albumin antibody produ ction but enhanced IL -12 and interferon gene transcription. Authors conclude that Malva sylvestris extract promotes an inflammatory response by induction of macrophages inducing them for production IL-12, which in turn activates Th1 lymphocytes which produce - interferon. Aerial parts (flowers and leaves) In vivo experiment Water extract Sleiman and Daher (2009) investigated the aqueous extract of Malva sylvestris aerial parts in acute and chronic inflammation models induced by carrageenan and formalin in rats. Doses of 50, 100, 250 and 500 mg/kg b.w. of the extract were used. Significant anti -inflammatory activity was observed at most doses used with an optimum inhibition at 100mg/kg body weight ( 60% inhibition) in both models. In other experiment protection against ethanol- induced gastric ulcer was evaluated. After administration of the Malva sylvestris aqueous extract at the dose of 500mg/kg body weight the maximum protection (37%) was obtained, a value significantly higher than that observed with a reference drug cimetidine where it reached 30%. In vivo experiment N-hexane, ethanol, and water extracts Anti-inflammatory effects of different fractions of Malva sylvestris were evaluated in acetic acid - induced ulcerative colitis model in rats by Hamedi et al . (2015). A total of 200 g of powdered aerial parts was sequentially extracted with n -hexane, ethanol, and water (3 x 1 L and 48 hours for each) at room temperature. The fractions were concentrated by a rotary evaporator at 4 0C and dried applying a speed vacuum dryer or a freeze dryer and kept at - 200C. Colitis in male rats was induced by rectal instillation of a 4% solution of acetic acid. Animals were divided into 8 experimental groups (6 in each) as follows: Normal group : without induction of colitis that received normal saline solution rectally at the day of induction. Negative control group : with induction of colitis that received distilled water orally. Positive control group : with induction of colitis that received prednisolone at dose 5 mg/kg/day orally prior to induction of colitis. Treatment group I : with induction of colitis that received aqueous fraction of Malva sylvestris at dose 200 mg/kg/day orally prior to induction of colitis. Treatment group II: with induction of colitis that received ethanolic fraction of Malva sylvestris at dose 200 mg/kg/day orally prior to induction of colitis. Treatment group III: with induction of colitis that received n -hexane fraction of Malva sylvestris at dose 200 mg/kg/day orally prior to induction of colitis. Treatment group IV: with induction of colitis that received the isolated polysaccharide of Malva sylvestris at dose 200 mg/kg/day orally prior to induction of colitis. In groups I to IV treatment was performed for 5 days consecutively before induction of colitis. Treatment group V : with induction of colitis that received the isolated polysaccharide of Malva sylvestris at dose 200 mg/kg/day orally for 5 days after in duction of colitis. Twenty -four hours after the last dose of the drug in treatment group V and 24 hours after induction of colitis in other groups, rats were subjected to autopsy. Macroscopic and microscopic evaluation of colitis showed that the aqueous fr action was very effective in preventing the inflammation and therapeutic effectiveness was lower for ethanolic and n -hexane fractions. Polysaccharide was effective in pretreatment reducing signs of inflammation. Assessment report on Malva protective effect of the water fraction of Malva sylvestris on reduction of microscopic and macroscopic parameters of colitis was significantly higher than prednisolone. Anti- inflammatory effects of the tested fractions in this study seem to be related to their polysaccharide and polyphenol content. Table 6.

Ulcers were not observed in rats treated with water and ethanolic extracts and the damage scores in these 2 groups were significantly lower than in the other groups. 3.1.2. Secondary pharmacodynamics Antimicrobial activity Flowers In vivo experiment Ethanolic extract Delaveau et al. (1980) administered to mice intraperitoneally the dry ethanolic extract (95%) of Malva sylvestris flowers in a dose of 50 mg/kg b.w. and registered an increase of survival of mice infected with Escherichia coli. This effect is attributed to the stimulation of phagocytic activity. Assessment report on Malva Leaves In vitro experiment Water extract Quave et al. (2008) tested several Italian plants, Malva sylvestris include d, for inhibition of growth and biofilms in methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Water extract of Malva sylvestris was made by boiling 1g (plant material) in 50 ml (dH2O) for 30 minu tes. It was fou nd, that biofilm formation by the water extract was inhibited at concentration of IC50 = 32 g/ml. Aerial parts In vitro experiment N-hexane, dichloromethane and methanolic extracts Razavi et of Malva sylvestris n-hexane, dichloromethane and methanolic flower and leaves extracts using disk diffusion method. The antibacterial and antifungal activity of the extracts were estimated against coli The MICs of the extracts against the test microorganisms were determined by the agar dilution method. It was found, that both flowers and leaves of M. sylvestris methanol extracts exhibited high antibacterial activity. These effects were compared with effects of erythromycin, gentamycin and amphotericin. In vitro experiment Decoction, infusion and micr owave Mihaylova et al. (2015) studied different extracts of fresh Malva sylvestris assisted extraction leaves and flowers for their level of total phenolics, antimicrobial activity against Gram -positive, Gram - negative bacteria, molds and yeasts. Moreover, their antioxidant activities were investigated using --picrylhydra zyl power - the change in absorbance owing to the formation of a blue coloured Fe (II) - tripyridyltriazine compound from colourless oxidized Fe (III) form), and CUPRAC (with use of Trolox as a standard and expressed as M of Trolox equivalent (TE)/g fresh weight (FW). Fresh leaves and flowers of Malva sylvestris produced three different types of extracts: 1) decoction - extraction by boiling of the plant material for 30min with distilled water; 2) infusion - extraction by boiling water and then pouring it over the plant material, allowing it to steep in the liquid for 20min; 3) micro wave assisted extraction (MAE) - the experiments were performed with water as solvent. The extracts solutions were filtered before analyses. Antimicrobial activity against saprophytic and pathogenic microrganisms: Gram -positive (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) was determined with the agar diffusion tests. The flowers were found to be more active against pathogenic microorganisms. In vitro experiment Hydroalcoholic extract Assessment report on Malva et al. evaluated antibacterial activity several plants, including the hydroa lcoholic extract of inflorescence and leaves of Malva sylvestris against eleven clinical isolates of Helicobacter pylori and two reference strains. All the strains were previously evaluated against clarithromycin, amoxicillin, furazolidone, tetracycline an d metronidazole. Disk diffusion test and determination of the miniumum inhibitory concentration were performed by the agar dilution method. Results demonstrated that the extracts obtained from M. sylvestris L. were capable of inhibiting the in vitro growth of H. pylori in the range of 0.625 to 5.0 mg/ml. In vitro experiment Chloroform, water and ethanolic extracts Zare et al. (2012) studied in vitro the antibacterial and antifungl activity of chloroform, ethanol and water extracts of the total aerial parts of Malva neglecta and Malva sylvestris . M. sylvestris and Malva neglecta extracts Experiments showed that all extracts were active against S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and P. vulgaris . The ethanolic extract had the highest antibacterial activity compared to other solvents. In vitro experiment Alcoholic extract (20% tincture) Malvae sylvestris antifungal activity was evaluated in vitro against cultures of strains of C. albicans (ATCC minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Malva sylvestris 20% tincture was estimated. As positive control Nystatin 100,000 UI/ml was used. M. sylvestris tincture shown MIC at 25 mg/ml for C. krusei and 100 mg/ml for C. albicans and C. tropicalis. The antimicrobial activity of products based on M sylvestris support their clinical use in the formulations for mouthwashes. In vivo experiment Hydroalcoholic extract Hydroalcoholic extract (2:118, ethanol 96%) of the aerial parts of Malva sylvestris diluted with sodium chloride 0.9% was investigated for antifungal activity in female NMRI mice by Hajyani et al. (2016). Groups of mice received an i.p. injection of 1\u00d7106 cfu/ml (colony -forming unit) once to induce infection of Candida albicans ATCC 1677. Treatment groups received 10 i.p. injections Malva sylvestris hydroalcoholic extract in 50, 100, 200 mg/kg doses for 20 days. Suspension of Candida albicans (1\u00d7106 cfu/ml) was injected between fifth and sixth injections of the extract. The study was carried out to investigate effects of Malva sylvestris extract on the number of viable fungal cells in a sample, plasma proteins and gamma interferon expression. Significant reduction in the amount of albumin in the three treatment groups was found. In turn, the amount of -globulin in groups receiving 50 to 100 mg/kg of the Malva sylvestris extract was significantly increased. Similarly, the amount of gamma interferon for all three treatment groups was also significantly increased when compared to the control group. Authors conclude that Malva sylvestris is able to stimulate an immune cellular response. Antioxidant activity Assessment report on Malva Aerial parts In vitro experiment Water extract The antioxidant activity of Malva sylvestris water extract was evaluated by Della Greca et al. (2009) by its capability to neutralize anionic DPPH and superoxide and to give rise to formation of the phosphomolybdenum complex. The analysis of the water extr act by applying the different chromatography techniques resulted in the isolation of eleven compounds: 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid, 4 - methoxybenzoic acid, 4 -hydroxy- 3-methoxybenzoic acid, 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid, -10 15- dienoic acid. The isolated compounds were present in the range of 0.3 to 3g/g in M. sylvestris . The strongest antioxidant activities were noted for 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid and a sesquiterpene, N- trans-feruloyl tyramine. Their antioxidant effects were significantly higher than shwed by the positive standard, - tocopherol. All metabolites presented an anion superoxide radical scavenging activity over 15% higher than that of a standard compound. In vitro experiment Ethanolic and acetone extracts Beghdad et al. (2014) studied the constituents of the leaves and flowers of mallow, Malva sylvestris L., as well as their ant ioxidant properties using in vitro methods. They used the ferric reducing antioxidant radical and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) based on the reduction of molybdenum (VI) to molybd enum (V). The concentration of phenolic compounds was higher in the extracts isolated from leaves (24.123 \u00b1 0.718 mg of gallic acid equivalents/g dried weight) than in flowers (6.978 \u00b10.602 mg of gallic acid equivalents). Similarly, the total flavonoids content was 5.694\u00b10.017 mg in the leaves and 0.170\u00b10.033 mg in the flowers (expressed as mg rutin equivalent/100 g dried weight). Other authors also found a higher phenolic content in leaves than in flowers (Barros et al. 2010). The evaluation of the antioxidant activity by three methods, including DPPH free radical scavenging activity, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) showed that ethyl acetate (AcOEt) and n-Butanol (n -BuOH) fractions in leaves have a highest value s of antioxidant activity. Concerning DPPH inhibition (%), all the samples proved to have high antioxidant activities (between 98.52 and 62.01%) and the greatest EC50 obtained was that of extracts of flavonoids, especially ethyl acetate (AcOEt - EC50 = 3. 10 mg/ml) showing the highest value of antioxidant activities for almost all parts of leaves. The concentration of the extract necessary to decrease DPPH radical scavenging by 50% and expressed as antiradical activity defined as 1/EC50 was for the leaves 0.059 and for the flowers 0.071 %. At 750 g/ml, the most potent reducing agents were the flavonoid extracts from AcOET (43.110%) and n -BuOH (32.671%) fractions of leaves. In the phosphor molybdenum assay, the extracts exhibited some degree of activity in a dose dependent manner. It was generally observed that AcOEt fraction was more active than the n -BuOH fraction with DPPH and FRAP method. Comparison showed a higher antioxidant capacity to reduce molybdenum (VI) to molybdenum (V) reported for AcOEt fractio n of leaves (0.138 \u00b1 0.006 mg of equivalent of ascorbic acid (EAA/g) and n -BuOH fraction of flower (0.118 \u00b1 0.018 mg EAA/g. The ethanol has been more efficient compared to the acetone Assessment report on Malva sylvestris L. solvent for extraction of antioxidants from leaf parts of M. sylvestris L. The ethanolic fraction has a better capacity probably due to higher hydrogen -donating constituents extracted by the solvent. The increase in antioxidant activity may be explained by the increase of solvent polarity. Other Activities Aerial parts Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity In vitro experiment Water extract and essential oil Ferreira et al. (2006) tested several Portuguese plants for AChE inhibitory activity, aerial parts of Malva sylvestris included. Plant material (12 -30 g) was dried in the dark and ground to a powder to obtain essential oils and ethanolic extracts. By hydrodistillation of the plant material 200 ml of the water -oil layer was obtained. The aqueous layer was extracted with n -pentane and afterwards the organic solvent was removed by vacuum distillation. Ethanolic extract was similarly received by extracting the plant material three times at room temperature. Decoction was prepared by boiling 5 g of dried plant material in 100 m l of distilled water for 20 min. Solutions were filtered. Decoction of Malva sylvestris in concentration of 5m/ml inhibited activity of AChE by 25\u00b15.7%. The essential oil of aerial parts of Malva sylvestris in concentration of 0.1 mg/ml induced inhibition of AChE by 28.1 \u00b1 2.9 %. Ethanolic extract did not had any inhibitory effect. Leaves Antinociceptive activity In vivo experiment Water extract Esteves et al. (2009) evaluated the antinociceptive activity of the Malvae sylvestris leaves aqueous extract. Initially the infusion of the leaves (10% w/v) was was filtered and lyophilized yielding 2.4% of aqueous extract. Experiments were performed on mice with use of writhing test, formalin -induced pain test, capsaicin -induced pain test and hot -plate test. Int raperitoneal administration of 10 mg/kg b.w. the aqueous extract induced significant antinociceptive activity in writhing test (76.4% of inhibition) and inhibition of the neurogenic (61.8%) and (46.6%) phases in the formalin model. In capsaic in-induced pain model, the aqueous extract was also effective with inhibition of 62.9%, but it did not cause significant activity against hot- plate model. The results could suggest that the antinociception caused by aqueous extract is related to the inhib ition of prostaglandins synthesis pathway cyclooxygenase and unrelated to the stimulation of the opioid receptors. In vitro experiment Hydroalcoholic extract Conforti et al. (2008) evaluated the acute toxicity of the hydroalcoholic extracts of Meditterra nean dietary plants, Malva sylvestris included. The Microtox acute toxicity test measures the decrease in Assessm ent report on Malva from the marine luminescent Vibrio fischeri bacteria when exposed to organic extracts. The test is applied in evaluating the toxicity of water soluble substances. The plant leaves were air dried and extracted with 70% aqueous ethanol through maceration (48 h x 3 times) at room temperature. The received extract was dried under reduced pressure. Initially the extract in ethanol 70%, with a concentration of 1 mg/ml, was diluted with the diluent solution to obtain both sample concentration and organic solvent concentration no higher than 1%. Then analytical samples were prepared by scaling dilution of the sample (factor of dilution = 2). It wa s found, that Malva sylvestris hydroalcoholic extract showed bioluminescence inhibition values of 17.16% after 5 min and 17.32% after 15 min of incubation. According to the guidelines ISO (ISO 11348/3, 2007) a toxic sample shows an effect percentage greater than 20%. This means that the hydroalcoholic extract of Malva sylvestris does not show toxicity under the established limit. Aerial parts Cytotoxic activity In vitro experiment Extract prepared with mixture of dichloromethane and methanol,(1: 1,v / v) Kaileh et al. (2007) have shown no cytotoxicity of Malva sylvestris aerial parts (dichloromethane and methanol, 1: 1, v / v) extract on murine fibrosarcoma L929sA cells. Hepatoprotective activity In vivo experiment Methanolic extract Hussain et al. (2014) studied the hepatoprotective effects of the whole plant methanol extract of Malva sylvestris L. against paracetamol hepatotoxicity in mice. The whole plant was washed and air dried. Afterwards it was pulverized into fine powder by a mechanical grinder and stored in the airtight bottles. Dried powder (almost 2 kg) was soaked in 6 L of 95% methanol and was kept on a shaker for 7 consecutive days. After that, the extracts were separated by filtration and concentrated at 40 \u00b0C under reduced pressure by rotary evaporator. The desired concentrations were obtained by dissolving the extract in physiological saline. Silymarin (100 mg / kg) was used as a comparator to analyze therapeutic effects of Malva sylvestris. Two doses (300 and 600 mg / kg) were administered i .p. for 7 consecutive days followed by i. p. injection with paracetamol (250 mg / kg). Paracetamol induced a significant increase of plasma levels of the liver enzymes as the liver damage markers: alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, extract of Malva sylvestris significantly reduced elevated concentrations of the liver enzymes in a dose dependent manner. As a result of the autopsy and histopathological examination of the liver tissue, paracetamol -treated group showed macrophages, plasma cell infiltration, vacuolization and cell necrosis. Treatment with Malva sylvestris followed by paracetamol administration sh owed few binucleated cells while most cells were normal, with slight congestion, vacuolization, and infiltration and dose dependently restored normal histological pattern of the liver. In particular, hepatoprotective effect was observed at a dose of 600 mg of the extract after which use no necrosis was evident. Assessment report on Malva sylvestris L. available 3.1.4. Pharmacodynamic interactions No data available. 3.1.5. Conclusions Available non -clinical data underline the plausibiliy of the traditional use of Malva sylvestris flowers and leaves for the symptomatic treatment of oral or pharyngeal irritation, associated dry cough and gastroenteritis. The reported pharmacological effects are not considered contradictory to the oral and oromucosal traditional use of herbal preparati ons of Malva sylvestris preparations as a demulcent for the symptomatic treatment of irritations of oral and pharyngeal mucosa with associated dry cough and for symptomatic relief of mild gastrointestinal discomfort. None of the reported pharmacological studies constitute any cause for safety concern. 3.2.

Conclusions No data on single dose and chronic toxicity are available. Tests on reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity have not been performed. Due to lack of toxicological data, a list entry for Malvae flos and Malvae folium cannot be recommended. In addition, the use during pregnancy and lactation should be avoided. 3.4. Overall conclusions on non -clinical data Despite non -clinical data on several activities of the extracts fod Malvae flos, Malvae folium and aerial parts of Malva sylvestris exist, a direct correlation of the test results (kind of extract, route of administration in vitro vs. in vivo ) with the clinical situation is not possible. Results from relevant experimental studies can explain the traditional uses of the Malva sylvestris flower and leaves as an infusion/decoction for symptomatic treatment of oral or pharyngeal irritation, associated dry cough and mild gastrointestinal discomfort. Specific data on pharmacokinetics and interactions are not available. Toxicological studies are not available. Tests on genotoxicity, reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity have not been performed. Oral administra tion and oromucosal use of Malvae sylvestris flowers and leaves infusions/decoctions can be regarded as safe at traditionally used small doses doses (maximum daily dose of 5 g for flowers and 5.4 grams for leaves) and adequate duration of use. 4.

Clinical efficacy Assessment report on Malva sylvestris L. Dose response studies No data available. 4.2.2. Clinical studies (case studies and clinical trials) One clinical study on a Malva sylvestris flowers aqueous syrup was found in the literature (Els agh et al. 2015). Briefly, Elsagh et al. (2015) described the placebo -controlled randomized clinical trial in adult patients with functional constipation treated with Malva sylvestris flowers aqueous syrup. A total 110 patients participated and started the medication (55 in verum and 55 in placebo group). Preparation of the M. sylvestris flower syrup was done in the Herbal Medicine Laboratory of the Shahid Beheshti School of Pharmacy (Tehran, Iran). One liter of boiled water (1000C) was added to 100 mg of dry flowers for four hours. The solvent was then removed under vacuum and sugar solution 50% was added to the extract (50 mg of the extract in each 1 cm3 of the syrup). Herb -to-extract ratio was then 6:1. Patients in the verum group received treatment for 4 weeks, 1g of extract/day equivalent to 10 cm3 of the syrup twice daily (2 - 3 h after breakfast and lunch). The the frequency of defecation per week and frequency of hard stool, straining during defecation, sensation of incomplete evacuation, and manual m aneuvers to facilitate evacuation were rated. An improvement or worsening in each symptom was assessed (self -rated) at the end of therapy by telephone interview. The primary outcome of the study was the changes in defecation and constipation symptoms' freq uency after treatment. Changes in stool consistency, overall self reported improvement in symptoms after treatment, and adverse effects were estimated as the secondary outcome. Comparisons between the two groups were performed with the t -Test, Mann -Whitney U Test, and Chi -Square (or Fisher's Exact) Test. ANOVA with repeated measures test for assessing time effect, treatment effect, and interaction between time and treatment was used. All data were analyzed on the intention -to treat rules. The author's repor ted that after 4 weeks treatment an increase in defecation frequency was observed (F = 18.8, p < 0.001) and more decrease in frequency of all constipation symptoms (F = 16.5 to 25.3, all p values <0.001). The verum group experienced also more reduction in frequency of hard stool forms (45.4% vs. 9.1%, P < 0.001) and reported more improvement in all symptoms (all p values <0.01) compared to placebo. Side effects occurred in a few patients from the verum group. In 4 patients diarrhea has been seen, in 4 patients acid regurgitation was observed, 2 patients experienced nausea and individual patients seen worse constipation, epigastric pain, heartburn and urticaria. In the study by Elsagh et al. 2015, a M. sylvestris flower syrup preparation was administered to patients with constipation. There are no medicinal products with this herbal preparation used for the treatment of constipation on the EU market. Therefore, the study can not be taken into consideration for the establishment of a well - establish use monograph. 4.3. Clinical studies in special populations (e.g. elderly and children) No data available. 4.4. Overall conclusions on clinical pharmacology and efficacy There are no published clinical studies on Malvae folium or Malvae sylvestris flos where the active substances of the medicinal product have been in medicinal use within the EU for at least ten years. Well-establish use in accordance with Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC is considered not fulfilled for Malvae fo lium or Malvae sylvestris flos. Clinical Safety/Pharmacovigilance 5.1. Overview of toxicological/safety data from clinical trials in humans No data available. 5.2. Patient exposure Malva sylvestris is traditionally used for food purposes in the countries of the Mediterranean basin: Portugal, Italy and Turkey Young leaves are eaten raw in a salad and are cooked as a vegetable. Unripe fruits are eaten raw (Prudente et al . 2013). 5.3. Adverse events, serious adverse events and deaths In placebo -controlled randomized clinica l trial in adult patients with functional constipation treated with Malva sylvestris flowers aqueous syrupt there was few and moderate side effects. Out of 55 treated patients in 4 patients diarrhea has been seen, in 4 patients acid regurgitation was obser ved, 2 patients experienced nausea and individual patients seen worse constipation, epigastric pain, heartburn and urticaria (Elsagh et al .2015). Literature describes two cases of acute liver and kidney damage, after oral consumption of Malva sylvestris and Malva sylvestris var. grandiflora . In both cases, the patients ate the mallow as a meal, and the nature of organ damage was acute. Fulminant liver failure and renal failure (Aktas et al . 2014) in a 36 year old female patient was fatal (hepatic and renal failure). Laboratory findings at admission were as follow: aspartate aminotransferase 1750 IU phosphatase IU transpeptidase IU / mL (control <38 IU / mL) albumin 2.9 g / dL, total bilirubin 4.2 mg / dL, and direct bilirubin 2.8 mg / dL. Prothrombin time was prolonged to 18 seconds. The case of liver injury associated with Malva grandifolia in 59-year-old woman with a medical history of hypertension was described by Ekiz et al. (2010). The woman with history of dyspepsia and long term hypertension treatment drunk Malva grandifolia juice (250 ml per day) for 4 weeks to control dyspeptic symptoms. Her laboratory da ta were as follows on admission: was notable for liver injury damage. Albumin, bilirubin, and prothrombin time were normal. After stopping drinking the juice, liver enzymes normalized quickly and were within normal limits after 10 days from admission. In both above mentioned case reports the exact amount of Malvae consumed as a vegetable, detailed species were not precisely specified and the clinical toxicological diagnosis is missing. The causal relationship could not be confirmed. 5.4. Laboratory findings No data available Assessment report on Malva sylvestris L. 5.5. Safety in special populations and situations 5.5.1.

Effects on ability to drive or operate machinery or impairment of mental ability No studies on the ability to drive or operate machinery have been performed. 5.5.8. Safety in other special situations Not applicable 5.6. Overall conclusions on clinical safety Recently, scientific literature describes two cases of poisoning of mallow consumed as food. However, there is no scientific confirmation of its toxicity when used in specified strength/posology and rout e of administration in the therapeutic indications proposed in the European Union monograph. The experimental toxicological data are limited, but given the history of long -term and present use in humans, also as food, it seems that there are no safety concerns for the oral or oromucosal use of preparations of common mallow. Assessment report on 37/38 6. Overall conclusions (benefit -risk assessment) There are no published clinical studies on Malvae folium or Malvae sylvestris flos where the active substances of the medicinal product have been in medicinal use within the EU for at least ten years. Well-establish use in accordance with Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC is considered not fulfilled for Malvae folium or Malvae sylvestris flos. The traditional medicinal use of Malva flowers a nd leaves has been documented in several medicinal handbooks with indications consistent with the existing pertinent pharmacological experiments performed in vitro and in vivo and it is substantiated by the presence of medicinal products on the European ma rket. The traditional use of malva preparations a mixture of both species, folium) fulfills the requirement for at least 30 years of medicinal use at a specified strength and specified posology, according to Directive 2001/83/EC as amended. All the requirements for TU (self -medication character, specified strength/posology, appropriate route of administration, period of traditional use, plausibility and safety) are met. The experimental toxicological data are not available, but given the history of long -term and present use in humans, also as food, it seems that there are no safety concerns for the oral or oromucosal use of preparations of common mallow in the doses propo sed in the monograph. The following indications and posologies are proposed for the European Union monographs: Malva sylvestris, L., flos Traditional herbal medicinal product used as a demulcent preparation for the symptomatic treatment of oral or pharyn geal irritation, associated dry cough and for the symptomatic relief of mild gastrointestinal discomfort. Posology for adults and adolescents over 12 years: single dose: 1 to 2 g of the comminuted herbal substance in 250 ml of water as a herbal tea for oral use (both indications) or as a herbal infusion or or as a decoction for oromucosal use 2 - 3 times daily (indication 1); average daily dose: 5 g. Malva sylvestris L. and/or Malva neglecta Wallr., folium Traditional herbal medicinal product used as a demulcent preparation for the symptomatic treatment of oral or pharyngeal irritation, associated dry cough and for the symptomatic relief of mild gastrointestinal discomfort. Posology for adults and adolescents over 12 years: single dose: 1.8 g of the comminuted herbal substance in 150 ml of water as a herbal tea for oral use (both indications) or as a herbal infusion or as a decoction for oromucosal use use 3 times daily (indication 1); daily dose: 5.4 g. The therapeutic areas for browse search with T U indications are: cough and cold and gastrointestinal disorders. As a general precaution related to the therapeutic indication for symptomatic treatment of oral or pharyngeal irritation, associated dry cough and gastrointestinal discomfort, the product in formation should include a warning text advising the patient to consult a doctor or a qualified health care Assessment report on Malva sylvestris L. 38/38 practitioner if the symptoms worsen or persist longer than 1 week during the use of the product for indication 1) and 2 weeks for indication 2). Malvae flos and Malvae folium cannot be recommended for oral use in children under 12 years of age due to lack of adequate data. Safety during pregnancy and lactation has not been established. In the absence of sufficient data, the use during pregnancy and lactation is not recommended. No data on fertility is available. No constituent with known therapeutic activity or active marker can be recognised by the HMPC. Tests on genotoxicity, reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity are not available A European Union list entry is not supported due to lack of data on genotoxicity. Annex List of references "}
