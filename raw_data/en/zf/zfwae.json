Vol. 02-8Preface The Idaho Administrative Bulletin is published once each month by the Department of Administration, Office of the Administrative Rules Coordinator, pursuant to Section 67-5203, Idaho Code. The Bulletin is a compilation of alladministrative rulemaking documents in Idaho. The Bulletin publishes the official text notice and full text of such actions. State agencies are required to provide public notice of rulemaking activity and invite public input. The public receives notice of a rulemaking activity through the Idaho Administrative Bulletin and the Legal Notice published monthly in local newspapers. The Legal Notice provides reasonable opportunity for public input, either oral orwritten, which may be presented to the agency within the time and manner specified in the Legal Notice. After the comment period closes, the agency considers fully all information submitted in regard to the rule. Comment periods are not provided in temporary or final rulemaking activities. CITATION TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The Bulletin is cited by year and issue number. For example, Bulletin 00-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2000, Bulletin 01-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2001, etc. Volume numbers, which proceed from 1 to 12 in a given year, correspond to the months of publication, i.e.; Volume No. 1 refers to January; Volume No. 2 refers to February; and so forth. Example: The Bulletin published in January of 2001 is citedas Volume 01-1, the December 1999 Bulletin is cited as Volume 99-12. The March 2000 Bulletin is cited as Volume 00-3. RELATIONSHIP TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE The Idaho Administrative Code is published once a year and is a compilation or supplemental compilation of all final and enforceable administrative rules in effect in Idaho. In an effort to provide the reader with current, enforceable rules, temporary rules are also published in the Administrative Code. Temporary rules and final rules that have been adopted and approved by the legislature during the legislative session, and published in the monthlyIdaho Administrative Bulletin, supplement the Administrative Code. Negotiated, proposed, and pending rules are not printed in the Administrative Code and are published only in the Bulletin. To determine if a particular rule remains in effect, or to determine if a change has occurred, the reader should refer to the Cumulative Index of Administrative Rulemaking , printed in each Bulletin. TYPES OF RULEMAKINGS PUBLISHED IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The state of Idaho administrative rulemaking process comprises five distinct activities; Negotiated, Proposed, Temporary, Pending, and Final rulemaking. Not all rulemakings consist of all five. At a minimum a rulemakingincludes proposed, pending, and final rulemaking. Many rules are adopted as temporary rules when meeting required statutory criteria and agencies often engage in negotiated rulemaking at the beginning of the process to facilitate concensus building in controversial or complex rulemakings. In the majority of cases, the process begins withproposed rulemaking and ends with final rulemaking. The following is a brief explanation of each type of administrative rule. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKINGIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 5 August 7, 2002 - Vol. 02-8Negotiated rulemaking is a process in which all interested parties and the agency seek a consensus on the content of the rule. Agencies are encouraged to proceed through this informal rulemaking whenever it is feasible todo so. Publication of the text in the Administrative Bulletin by the agency is optional. This process should lead the rulemaking to the temporary and/or proposed rule stage. PROPOSED RULEMAKING A proposed rulemaking is an action by an agency in which the agency is proposing to amend or repeal an existing rule or to adopt a new rule. Prior to the adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, the agency must publish anotice of proposed rulemaking in the Bulletin. The notice of proposed rulemaking must include: a) the specific statutory authority for the rulemaking including a citation to a specific federal statute or regulation if that is the basis of authority or requirement for the rulemaking; b) a statement in nontechnical language of the substance of the proposed rule, including a specific description of any fee or charge imposed or increased; c) the text of the proposed rule prepared in legislative format; d) the location, date, and time of any public hearings the agency intends to hold on the proposed rule; e) the manner in which persons may make written comments on the proposed rule, including the name and address of a person in the agency to whom comments on the proposal may be sent; f) the manner in which persons may request an opportunity for an oral presentation; and g) the deadline for public (written) comments on the proposed rule. As stated, the text of the proposed rule must be published in the Bulletin. After meeting the statutory rulemaking criteria for a proposed rule, the agency may proceed to the pending rule stage. A proposed rule does not have anassigned effective date unless published in conjunction with a temporary rule docket. An agency may vacate a proposed rulemaking if it decides not to proceed further with the promulgation process. TEMPORARY RULEMAKING Temporary rules may be adopted only when the governor finds that it is necessary for: a) the protection of the public health, safety, or welfare; or b) compliance with deadlines in amendments to governing law or federal programs; or c) conferring a benefit. If a rulemaking meets any one or all of the above requirements, a rule may become effective before it has been submitted to the legislature for review and the agency may proceed and adopt a temporary rule. A temporary rule expires at the conclusion of the next succeeding regular session of the legislature unless the rule is approved, amended, or modified by concurrent resolution or when the rule has been replaced by a final rule. In cases where the text of the temporary rule is the same as that of the proposed rule, the rulemaking can be done concurrently as a temporary/proposed rule. State law requires that the text of a proposed or temporary rule be published in the Administrative Bulletin. Combining the rulemaking allows for a single publication of the text.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 6 August 7, 2002 - Vol. 02-8An agency may rescind a temporary rule that has been adopted and is in effect if the rule is being replaced by a new temporary rule or has been published concurrently with a proposed rulemaking that is being vacated. PENDING RULEMAKING A pending rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under the regular rulemaking process and remains subject to legislative review before it becomes a final, enforceable rule. When a pending rule is published in the Bulletin, the agency is required to include certain information in the Notice of Pending Rule. This includes: a) the reasons for adopting the rule; b) a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for any changes; c) the date the pending rule will become final and effective; and d) an identification of any portion of the rule imposing or increasing a fee or charge. Agencies are required to republish the text of the rule when substantive changes have been made to the proposed rule. An agency may adopt a pending rule that varies in content from that which was originally proposed if the subject matter of the rule remains the same, the pending rule is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule, and the original notice was written so as to assure that members of the public were reasonably notified of the subject. It is notalways necessary to republish all the text of the pending rule. With the permission of the Rules Coordinator, only the Section(s) that have changed from the proposed text are republished. If no changes have been made to the previously published text, it is not required to republish the text again and only the Notice of Pending Rule is published. FINAL RULEMAKING A final rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under the regular rulemaking process and is in effect. No pending rule adopted by an agency will become final and effective until it has been submitted to the legislature for review. Where the legislature finds that the agency has violated the legislative intent of the statute under which the rule was made, a concurrent resolution will be adopted rejecting, amending, or modifying the rule orany part thereof. A Notice of Final Rule must be published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin for any rule that is rejected, amended, or modified by the legislature showing the changes made. A rule that has been reviewed by the legislature and has not been rejected, amended, or modified will become final with no further legislative action. Norule shall become final and effective before the conclusion of the regular or special legislative session at which the rule was submitted for review. However, a rule which is final and effective may be applied retroactively, as provided in the rule.

HOW TO USE THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Rulemaking documents produced by state agencies and published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin are organized by a numbering system. Each state agency has a two-digit identification code number known as the \"IDAPA\" number. (The \"IDAPA\" Codes are listed in the alphabetical/numerical index at the end of this Preface.) Within each agency there are divisions or departments to which a two-digit \"TITLE\" number is assigned. There are\"CHAPTER\" numbers assigned within the Title and the rule text is divided among major sections with a number of subsections. An example IDAPA number is as follows: IDAPA 38.05.01.060.02.c.ii. \"IDAPA\" refers to Administrative Rules in general that are subject to the Administrative Procedures Act and are required by this act to be published in the Idaho Administrative Code and the Idaho Administrative Bulletin. \"IDAPA 38. \" refers to the Idaho Department of Administration. \"05.\" refers to Title 05 which is the Department of Administration 's Division of Purchasing. \"01.\" refers to Chapter 01 of Title 05, \"Rules of the Division of Purchasing \". \"060.\" refers to Major Section 060, \"Content of the Invitation to Bid \". \"02.\" refers to Subsection 060. 02. \"c.\" refers to Paragraph 060.02. c. \"ii.\" refers to Subparagraph 060.02.c. ii.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 8 August 7, 2002 - Vol. 02-8DOCKET NUMBERING SYSTEM Internally, the Bulletin is organized sequentially using a rule docketing system. All rulemaking actions (documents) are assigned a \"DOCKET NUMBER \". The \"Docket Number \" is a series of numbers separated by a hyphen \"-\", (38-0501-0101). The docket numbers are published sequentially by IDAPA designation (e.g. the two- digit agency code). The following example is a breakdown of a typical rule docket: \"DOCKET NO. 38-0501-0101\" \"38-\" denotes the agency 's IDAPA number; in this case the Department of Administration. \"0501-\" refers to the TITLE AND CHAPTER numbers of the agency rule being promulgated; in this case the Division of Purchasing (TITLE 05), \"Rules of the Division of Purchasing \" (Chapter 01). \"0101\" denotes the year and sequential order of the docket submitted and published during the year; in this case the first rulemaking action of the chapter published in calendar year 2001. Within each Docket, only the affected sections of chapters are printed. (See Sections Affected Index in each Bulletin for a listing of these.) The individual sections affected are printed in the Bulletin sequentially (e.g. Section\"200\" appears before Section \"345\" and so on). Whenever the sequence of the numbering is broken the following statement will appear: \"(BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) \" INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CITATIONS TO ADMINISTRATIVE RULES IN THE CODE AND BULLETIN When making a citation to another Section or Subsection that is part of the same rule, a typical internal citation may appear as follows : \"...as found in Section 201 of this rule. \" OR \"...in accordance with Subsection 201.06.c. of this rule. \" It may also be cited to include the IDAPA, Title, and Chapter number also, as follows: TITLE number of the agency rule. \"01\" denotes the Chapter number of the agency rule. \"201\" references the main Section number of the rule that is being cited. Citations made within a rule to a different rule chapter (external citation) should also include the name of the Department and the name of the rule chapter being referenced, as well as the IDAPA, Title, and Chapter numbers. The following is a typical example of an external citation to another rule chapter: \"...as outlined in the Rules of the Department of Administration, IDAPA 38.04.04, 'Rules Governing Capitol Mall Parking.

(3-15-02) ii. Facility is Over the Direct Care Limit - If the facility operates a special rate unit, the costs of which exceed the direct care limit, with all direct care costs included in the rate calculation, the special rate for the unit will be equal to the lesser of the per diem amount by which direct care costs exceed the limit, or the special rate add-on calculated as follows: each Medicaid resident approved for a special rate is classified using Medicare 's grouper (currently RUG 's III v.5.12 44 Group) and is assigned a total rate equal to the applicable Medicare price that would be paid if the resident were Medicare eligible. The special rate \"add-on\" to the facility rate is calculated by subtracting the resident-specific Medicaid rate (based on each resident's Medicaid CMI) from the Medicare price. The average ofthe special rate add-on amounts calculated using this methodology shall be compared to the amount the provider is over the limit. The lesser amount is allowed as a special rate. (3-15-02) iii. New Unit Added Before July 1, 2000 - A unit added before July 1, 2000 that does not have sufficient historical cost data in the cost report used to set the rate shall receive the same rate that would have been set under the retrospective system until a cost report with sufficient cost detail is filed. (3-15-02) iv. New Unit Added After July 1, 2000 - To qualify for special rates, new units, or increases to the number of licensed beds in an existing unit must first receive Departmental approval. Since a new unit will not havethe cost history of an existing unit, the provider's relationship to the cap will not be considered in qualifying for a special rate. Those residents who are approved for special rates will have their special rate calculated as the difference between the applicable Medicare price under PPS, and the Medicaid rate for that individual resident as explained inSection 310.08.a.ii. of these rules. However, the amount would not be limited to the amount the provider is over the limit, as the costs of the unit are not in the rate calculation. (3-15-02) v. One Hundred Percent (100%) Special Care Facility in Existence as of July 1, 2000 - If at July 1, 2000 an entire facility is devoted to caring for \"special rate \" residents, including Medicaid residents approved for special rates as well as private pay and other residents who would qualify for special rates if they were Medicaideligible, the facility 's allowable reimbursement will be calculated as follows. The costs of the direct care component will not be subject to the cost limit. However, those costs will still be case-mix adjusted based on the ratio of the Medicaid case-mix to the facility-wide case-mix index. (3-15-02) vi. Customary Charge - If the cost to operate a special rate unit is being included in a facility 's rate calculation process, the facility must report its usual and customary charge for that unit on the quarterly reportingform. A weighted customary charge shall be computed by taking the number of Medicaid days approved for special rates times the usual and customary charge for private pay individuals in that unit, plus the Medicaid days not in the special rate unit times the usual and customary charge for that portion of the facility. (3-15-02) b. Equipment/Non-Therapy Supplies. Equipment and non-therapy supplies not adequately addressed in the current RUG's system shall be reimbursed at invoice cost as an add-on to the facility's rate for the residentreceiving the equipment or supplies. The facility need not exceed the direct care limit to receive a special rate for such services. Items that qualify for such treatment include but are not limited to the following: air fluidized beds, overlay mattresses, TPN supplies and VAC wound care. (3-15-02) c. Ventilator Dependent Residents And Residents Receiving Tracheotomy Care. In the case of ventilator dependent and tracheotomy residents, a two (2) step approach shall be taken to establish the special rate.The facility need not exceed the direct care limit to receive a special rate for ventilator care and tracheotomy care. The first step is the calculation of a staffing add-on for the cost, if any, of additional direct care staff required to meet the exceptional needs of these residents. The add-on shall be calculated following the provisions set forth inSubsection 310.08.d. of these rules. The second step shall be an equipment, and/or supply, or both, add-on to be added to the rate up to the invoice cost or rental amount. The combined amount of these two (2) components shall be considered the special rate.

Residents Who Do Not Reside in a Special Rate Unit Requiring One-to-One Staffing Ratios. Facilities that do not have established units with a cost history built into their cost reports and rates may at times haveresidents who require unusual levels of staffing; such as, one-to-one staffing ratios. If the resident qualifies for a special rate, the additional reimbursement will be allowed as follows: (3-15-02) e. For differing levels of one-to-one care; i.e., eight (8) hours or twenty-four (24) hours, only the total hours of one-to-one care approved would be changed in Subsection 310.08.d. CNA wage rate asdescribed in IDAPA 16.03.09, \"Rules Governing Medical Assistance, \" Section 148 will be updated prior to the July 1st rate setting each year. Should the WAHRS survey be discontinued, prior amounts may be indexed forward, or a comparable survey may be conducted. (3-15-02) 09. Treatment Of The Special Rate Cost For Future Rate Setting Periods . Special rates shall be established on a prospective basis similar to the overall facility rate. When a cost report is used to set a prospectiverate contains special rate cost, an adjustment shall be made to \"offset,\" or remove, the amount received for the special rates from the calculation of costs. The amount received shall be calculated by multiplying the special rate paid for each qualifying resident by the number of days that were paid. The case-mix index for each resident shall be left inthe facility-wide average and the Medicaid average for rate setting purposes, as the offset would only be for the incremental portion of the rate, above what Medicaid would have paid.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5226(1) and 67-5221(1), Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that the Board of Environmental Quality (Board) has adopted a temporary rule and the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) is commencing proposed rulemaking to promulgate a final rule. The action is authorized by Sections 39-105 and 39-107, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: No hearings have been scheduled. Pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hearing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency.Written requests for a hearing must be received by the undersigned on or before August 21, 2002. If no such written request is received, a public hearing will not be held. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a non-technical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: Department of Health and Welfare rule chapter IDAPA 16.05.05, \"Rules Governing Fees for Health and Environmental Operating Permits, Licenses and Inspection Services, \" contains sections imposing environmental fees which are no longer flexible enough to meet the needs of the different health districts. This rulemaking deletessections relating to the imposition of environmental fees, parcel surveys and sanitary restriction administration, and transfers those sections to a new DEQ rule chapter to be cited as IDAPA 58.01.14, \"Rules Governing Fees for Environmental Operating Permits, License and Inspection Services, \" (Docket No. 58-0114-0201). The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should beaddressed. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Due to the nature of this rulemaking, negotiations were not held. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Sections 67-5226(1)(c), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate in that the rule confers a benefit. Temporary adoption wouldbenefit local government, the health districts and the regulated community. By repealing the sections of the rule in IDAPA 16.05.05 that are related to programs administered by DEQ, and DEQ adopting the equivalent language for these sections, there is no increase in fees imposed by these actions. Language has been added to the generalEnvironmental Fees section that allows for local government or the health districts to adopt their own fees for services. Without the timely adoption of this rulemaking, there is a risk that health district fees could not be collected and necessary programs would not be adequately supported. GENERAL INFORMATION: For more information about DEQ 's programs and activities, visit DEQ 's web site at www.state.id.us/deq.

The purpose of this program is to ensure that operators of public wastewater treatment facilities have the technical expertise and certification to operate wastewater facilities in a manner to protect human health and the source waters of the state. The rules will provideconsistency and standardization in nine areas: (1) definition of a public wastewater facility to identify facilities and operators affected by the rule, (2) a classification system for operators and wastewater collection systems and wastewater treatment facilities, (3) operator qualifications, (4) certification renewal requirements, (5) ongoingprofessional growth requirements, (6) re-certification, (7) enforcement provisions for noncompliance, (8) resources needed to implement the new rules, and (9) ongoing stakeholder involvement. The proposed rule also includes reciprocity criteria, confidentiality language, contracting options, grandparenting rights, a wastewater landapplication endorsement for operators of wastewater land application systems, and periodic program and rule reviews. The new rules will affect wastewater treatment and collections operators, the Idaho Water and Wastewater Operator Certification Board, wastewater permit programs, wastewater collection system owners, wastewater treatment facility owners, the Association of Idaho Cities, Pacific Northwest Pollution Control Association, operator trainers,other special interest groups, and the general public. This proposed rule regulates activities not regulated by the federal government but mandated by Idaho statute. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed. After consideration of public comments, the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) intends to presentthe final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in the fall of 2002 for adoption of a pending rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon the conclusion of the 2003 session of the Idaho Legislature. FEE SUMMARY: The rules will allow reasonable fees to be charged for application, examination and annual renewals. The fees will be used to help fund the ongoing costs of administering the wastewater certification program. Indirect fees will result from continuing education requirements. Imposition of the fees is authorized by Section 39-119, Idaho Code.

The action is authorized by Sections 39-105, 39-107, and39-3601 et seq., Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: A public hearing concerning this proposed rulemaking will be held as follows: August 22, 2002, 6:30 p.m. Department of Environmental Quality Conference Center1410 N. Hilton, Boise, Idaho. Before opening the record to receive oral comments, DEQ staff intends to make a brief presentation and answer questions regarding the rule. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made no later than five (5) days prior to the hearing. For arrangements, contact the undersigned at (208)373-0418. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The purpose of this rulemaking is to adopt site-specific water quality criteria for portions of the Boise River for copper and lead. Section 275 of the Idaho water quality standards provide for developing new water quality criteria or modifying existing water quality criteria through site-specific analyses which will effectively protect designated and existing uses. Any person may develop site-specific criteria inaccordance with these rules. In the case of the Boise River, the City of Boise has commissioned tests into differences between the toxicity of copper and lead to test organisms in river water, compared to the toxicity values used in the EPA criteria documents. Results of these tests indicate that copper and lead criteria in the Boise River may be raised by about 2.6 times and 2.0 times respectively, and would still likely protect fish and other aquatic life in the Boise River. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to present the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in the fall of 2002 for adoption of a pending and temporary rule. This rule is proposed for temporary adoptiondue to compliance deadlines. The City of Boise is subject to comply with new effluent limits for copper and lead with the earliest deadline of February 12, 2003. If site-specific criteria modifications for copper and lead are adopted and approved by EPA, some aspects of their compliance schedule would be unnecessary or could be modified. Meetingthe current compliance schedules would incur additional capital and operating expenses for the City and its ratepayers. These additional expenses may not provide a significant benefit to the environment and might be avoided if proposed site-specific water quality criteria become effective. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should beaddressed. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Due to the nature of this rulemaking, negotiations were not held.

Procedures For Establishing Site-specific Water Quality Criteria . The water quality criteria adopted in these standards may not always reflect the toxicity of a pollutant in a specific water body. These criteriaalso represent a limited number of the natural and human-made chemicals that exist in the environment which may pose a threat to designated or existing beneficial uses. Thus, it may be possible in some water bodies to develop new water quality criteria or modify existing criteria through site-specific analyses which will effectively protectdesignated and existing beneficial uses. (8-24-94) a.The following are acceptable conditions for developing site-specific criteria: (8-24-94) i. Resident species of a water body are more or less sensitive than those species used to develop a water quality criterion. (8-24-94) (1) Natural adaptive processes have enabled a viable, balanced aquatic community to exist in waters where natural background levels of a pollutant exceed the water quality criterion (i.e., resident species have evolved agreater resistance to higher concentrations of a pollutant). (8-24-94) (2) The composition of aquatic species in a water body is different from those used to derive a water quality criterion (i.e., more or less sensitive species to a pollutant are present or representative of a water body than have been used to derive a criterion). (8-24-94) ii. Biological availability and/or toxicity of a pollutant may be altered due to differences between the physicochemical characteristics of the water in a water body and the laboratory water used in developing a water quality criterion (e.g., alkalinity, hardness, pH, salinity, total organic carbon, suspended solids, turbidity, naturalcomplexing, fate and transport water, or temperature). (8-24-94) iii. The affect of seasonality on the physicochemical characteristics of a water body and subsequent effects on biological availability and/or toxicity of a pollutant may justify seasonally dependent site-specific criteria. (8-24-94) iv. Water quality criteria may be derived to protect and maintain existing ambient water quality. (8-24-94) v. Other factors or combinations of factors that upon review of the Department may warrant modifications to the criteria. (8-24-94) b.Any person may develop site-specific criteria in accordance with these rules. To insure that theDEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0102-0203 Water Quality Standards/Wastewater Treatment Requirements Proposed Rulemaking IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 104 August 7, 2002 - Vol. 02-8approach to be used in developing site-specific criteria is scientifically valid, the Department shall be involved early in the planning of any site-specific analyses so that an agreement can be reached concerning the availability ofexisting data, additional data needs, methods to be used in generating new data, testing procedures to be used, schedules to be followed and quality control and assurance provisions to be used. (8-24-94) c.Site-specific criteria shall not impair designated or existing beneficial uses year-round (or seasonally for seasonal dependent criteria) and shall prevent acute and chronic toxicity outside of approved mixing zones. If site-specific criteria are seasonally dependent, the period when the criteria apply shall be clearly identified. (8-24-94) d.Site-specific criteria, if appropriate, shall include both chronic and acute concentrations to more accurately reflect the different tolerances of resident species to the inherent variability between concentrations and toxicological characteristics of a pollutant. (8-24-94) e.Site-specific criteria shall be clearly identified as maximum (not to be exceeded) or average values. If a criterion represents an average value, the averaging period shall be specified. The conditions, if any, when the criteria apply shall be clearly stated (e.g., specific levels of hardness, pH, water temperature, or bioavailability).Specific sampling requirements (location, frequency, etc.), if any, shall also be specified. (8-24-94) f.A site may be limited to the specific area affected by a point or nonpoint source of pollution or, if appropriate, an expanded geographical area (e.g., ecoregion, river basin, sub-basin, etc.). For a number of different water bodies to be designated as one site, their respective aquatic communities cannot vary substantially in sensitivity to a pollutant. Site boundaries shall be geographically defined. (8-24-94) g.Proposed site-specific water quality criteria must be approved by the Board in accordance with the Idaho Administrative Procedure Act. The Department of Environmental Quality shall determine whether to approve arequest for site-specific criteria in accordance with this section and within twenty-eight (28) days after receipt of the request, and will introduce acceptable site-specific criteria for rule-making. (8-24-94) h. The following are acceptable procedures for developing site-specific criteria for aquatic life protection. (8-24-94) i. Site-specific analyses for the development of new water quality criteria shall be conducted in a manner which is scientifically justifiable and consistent with the assumptions and rationale in \"Guidelines for Deriving Numerical National Water Quality Criteria for the Protection of Aquatic Organisms and Their Uses, \" EPA 1985. This document is available for review at the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality or may be obtained from EPA or the U.S. Government Printing Office. (8-24-94) ii. Site-specific analyses for the modification of existing water quality criteria shall be conducted in accordance with one of the following procedures, as described in the \"Water Quality Standards Handbook \", EPA 1983. This document is available for review at the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality or may be obtainedfrom EPA or the U.S. Government Printing Office. (8-24-94) (1) Recalculation Procedure. This procedure is used to account for differences in sensitivity to a pollutant between resident species and those species used in deriving the criterion. Bioassays in laboratory water may be required for untested resident species. (8-24-94) (2) Indicator Species Procedure. This procedure is used to account for differences in biological availability and/or toxicity of a chemical between the physicochemical characteristics of the water in a water body and the laboratory water used in developing criteria. Bioassays in site water are required using resident species oracceptable nonresident species. (8-24-94) (3) Resident Species Procedure. This procedure is used to account for differences in both resident species sensitivity and biological availability and/or toxicity of a pollutant. Bioassays in site water using resident species are required. (8-24-94) (4) Water effects ratios as defined by EPA guidance documents.

(8-24-94) (a) Deviations from the above described EPA procedures shall have justifications which are adequately documented and based on sound scientific rationale. (8-24-94) (b) The data, testing procedures and application factors used to develop site-specific criteria shall reflect the nature of the pollutant (e.g., persistency, bioaccumulation potential, avoidance or attraction responses in fish, etc.), the designated and existing beneficial uses, and the most sensitive resident species of a water body. (8-24-94) 02. Water Quality Criteria For Specific Waters . Standards provided in Sections 276 through 298 for specific waters will supersede Sections 210, 250, 251, 252, and 253 when the application of the standards contained in both sections would present a conflict. (4-5-00)( ) (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) 278. LOWER BOISE RIVER SUBBASIN, HUC 17050114 SUBSECTION Salmonid Spawning And Dissolved Oxygen . The waters of the Boise River from Veterans State Park to its mouth will have dissolved oxygen concentrations of six (6) mg/l or seventy-five percent (75%) of saturation, whichever is greater, during the spawning period of salmonid fishes inhabiting those waters. (3-15-02) 02. Indian Creek, SW-3b, Mason Creek, SW-6, And Sand Hollow Creek, SW-17 - Modified Aquatic Life Use . All numeric criteria applicable to the seasonal cold water aquatic life use apply with the exception of dissolved oxygen. Dissolved oxygen concentrations are to exceed four (4) mg/l at all times. (3-15-02) 03. Fifteenmile Creek, SW-7; Tenmile Creek, SW-8, And Five Mile Creek, SW-10 - Modified Aquatic Life Use . All numeric criteria applicable to the seasonal cold water aquatic life use apply.

The action is authorized by Sections 39-105, 39-107, and39-3601 et seq., Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: A public hearing concerning this proposed rulemaking will be held as follows: August 22, 2002, 6:30 p.m. Department of Environmental Quality Conference Center1410 N. Hilton, Boise, Idaho. Before opening the record to receive oral comments, DEQ staff intends to make a brief presentation and answer questions regarding the rule. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made no later than five (5) days prior to the hearing. For arrangements, contact the undersigned at (208)373-0418. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: This rulemaking relates to: 1) annual use designations and 2) criteria for chemical substances in surface water. 1. The Idaho water quality standards include a catalog of all the waters in the state which are to have use designations for state waters. This rulemaking adds new designations to the tables at Sections 110 through 160 and 252. The proposed use designations are based upon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) Beneficial Use Reconnaissance Program (BURP) data, subbasin assessments, or other data compiled by DEQ regional officesrelevant to beneficial use designations. Proposed designations for the \"salmonid spawning \" beneficial use are supported by data that includes the presence of juvenile salmonids which suggests that salmonid spawning occurs in the vicinity. Designations for \"cold water \" aquatic life use without a \"salmonid spawning \" designation are proposed for waters in which cold water species fish or other aquatic life may be found, but no evidence of salmonid spawning has been documented. The significance between a proposed \"cold water \" designation with or without a \"salmonid spawning \" designation is primarily that colder temperature criteria may be applied to \"salmonid spawning \" waters during the spawning season. Designations for waters to have water quality suitable for recreation are proposed as either \"primary contact\" or \"secondary contact. \" \"Primary contact \" designations are appropriate for water bodies suitable for activities like swimming, kayaking, or water skiing where full immersion and incidental swallowing of some water is likely. \"Secondary contact \" designations are appropriate for smaller streams where full immersion and incidental swallowing of water are uncommon. The difference between water suitable for \"primary contact \" or \"secondary contact\" recreation is that more stringent bacteria criteria apply to \"primary contact \" waters. Several streams in the Bear Lake subbasin are additionally proposed for a \"special resource water \" (SRW) designation. This designation is appropriate for waters of unique ecological significance or other characteristics described in Section 056 of the waterquality standards. These Bear Lake tributaries are unique in that they are among the few waters in which Bonneville cutthroat trout live in Idaho. The SRW designations are consistent with existing use designations for other Bear Lake tributaries. 2. The Clean Water Act requires that from time to time, but at least every three years, the State shall seek public participation and hold a public hearing for the purpose of reviewing applicable water quality standardsincluding use designations, and as appropriate modifying and adopting standards. In lieu of only conducting reviews every third year, the DEQ generally conducts ongoing reviews and annually seeks comment on proposed updates to the lists of beneficial uses designated for protection in different water bodies. The act specifically requires that forany water bodies that are not designated so that water quality is suitable for aquatic life and recreation, the State is to review any new information that may have become available. If the new information indicates that the so-called \"fishable\" and \"swimmable \" use designations are attainable, the State shall revise its standards accordingly. Water bodies presently designated as having either use designated as \"unattainable \" are Soda Creek and Soda Creek Reservoir near the town of Soda Springs, and Blackbird, West Fork Blackbird, and Bucktail creeks near the town ofDEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0102-0204 Water Quality Standards/Wastewater Treatment Requirements Proposed Rulemaking IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 107 August 7, 2002 - Vol. 02-8Salmon. The DEQ makes a standing request for 1) recent information regarding whether aquatic life or recreation uses are attainable for these water bodies, and 2) recommendations for other aspects of the Idaho water qualitystandards for future review and potential revision. 3. Currently, chemical water quality criteria are not listed in the Idaho water quality standards. Instead, the June 1993 version of 40 CFR 131.36 is incorporated by reference, with various exceptions. This has proven to be confusing or difficult for the public to look up what the applicable chemical water quality criteria are. The 1993 copy of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) is no longer in print or readily accessible, and current versions of the CFRare different from the 1993 version. The proposed rule would replace the incorporation by reference with the actual values. No substantive changes are proposed to how these criteria have already been incorporated into Idaho water quality standards. Minor changes are proposed to update the publication consistent with the current language of 40CFR 131.36; these include expressing specified metals criteria as dissolved metals consistent with 40 CFR 131.36.c.4.iii and adopting the low flow provisions of 40 CFR 131.36.c.2. These low flow provisions, below which criteria would not apply, have long been used in effluent permit calculations, although they had never actually beenadopted into the State water quality standards. Existing paragraphs for chlorine are deleted since it has been added to the criteria table. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed.

Hardness dependent metals criteria are calculated using values from the following table in the equations: ( ) exp{mc[ln(hardness)]+bc} X Chronic Conversion Factor. ( )i. Aquatic life criteria for these metals are expressed as a function of total hardness (mg/L as calcium carbonate), the pollutant 's water effect ratio (WER) as defined in Subsection 210.03.b.ii and multiplied by an appropriate dissolved conversion factor as defined in Subsection 210.02. For comparative purposes only, the values displayed in this table are shown as dissolved metal and correspond to a total hardness of one hundred (100) mg/L and a water effect ratio of one (1.0). j.Criteria are expressed as weak acid dissociable (WAD) cyanide. k.Total chlorine residual concentrations. l.This criterion is based on carcinogenicity of 10-6 risk. m.Aquatic life criteria for pentachlorophenol are expressed as a function of pH, and are calculated as follows. Val- ues displayed above in the table correspond to a pH of seven and eight tenths (7.8). CMC = exp(1.005(pH)-4.830) CCC = exp(1.005(pH)-5.290) n.PCBs are a class of chemicals which include Aroclors, 1242, 1254, 1221, 11096825 and 12674112 respectively. The aquatic life criteria apply to this set of PCBs. o.This criterion applies to total PCBs, (e.g. the sum of all congener, isomer, or Aroclor analyses).

The criteria established in Section 210 are subject to the general rules of applicability in the same way and to the same extent as are the other numeric chemical criteria when applied to the same use classifications including mixing zones, and low flow design discharge conditions below which numeric standards can be exceeded in flowing waters. ( ) a.For all waters for which the Department has determined mixing zones to be applicable, the criteria apply at the appropriate locations specified within or at the boundary of the mixing zone of the mixing zones; otherwise the criteria apply through the waterbody including at the end of any discharge pipe, canal or other discharge point. ( ) b.Low flow design discharge conditions. Numeric chemical standards can only be exceeded in perennial streams due to permitted discharges when flows are less than the following values: ( ) i.Where \"1Q10\" is the lowest one-day flow with an average recurrence frequency of once in ten (10) years determined hydrologically; ( ) ii.Where \"1B3\" is biologically based and indicates an allowable exceedence of once every three (3) years. It may be determined by EPA 's computerized method (DFLOW model); ( ) iii.Where \"7Q10\" is the lowest average seven (7) consecutive day low flow with an average recurrence frequency of once in ten (10) years determined hydrologically; ( ) iv.Where \"4B3\" is biologically based and indicates an allowable exceedence for four (4) consecutive days once every three (3) years. It may be determined by EPA 's computerized method (DFLOW model); ( ) v.Where \"30Q5\" is the lowest average thirty (30) consecutive day low flow with an average recurrence frequency of once in five (5) years determined hydrologically; and ( ) vi.Where the harmonic mean flow is a long term mean flow value calculated by dividing the number of daily flows analyzed by the sum of the reciprocals of those daily flows.

The maximum hardness allowed for use in those equations shall not be greater than four hundred (400) mg/l, as calcium carbonate, even if the actual ambient hardness is greater than four hundred (400) mg/l as calcium carbonate. ( ) ii.The hardness values used for calculating aquatic life criteria for metals at design discharge conditions shall be representative of the ambient hardnesses for a receiving water that occur at the design discharge conditions given in Subsection 210.03.b. ( ) iii.Except as otherwise noted, the aquatic life criteria for metals (compounds #1 through #13 in the criteria table of Subsection 210.02) are expressed as dissolved metal concentrations. Unless otherwise specified by the Department, dissolved concentrations are considered to be concentrations recovered from a sample which has passed through a forty-five hundredths (0.45) micron filter. For the purposes of calculating aquatic life criteria for metals from the equations in footnote e in the criteria table in Subsection 210.01, the water effect ratio is computed as a specific pollutant 's acute or chronic toxicity values measured in water from the site covered by the standard, divided by the respective acute or chronic toxicity value in laboratory dilution water. The water-effect ratio shall be assigned a value of one (1.0), except where the Department assigns a different value that protects the designated uses of the water body from the toxic effects of the pollutant, and is derived from suitable tests on sampled water representative of conditions in the affected water body, consistent with the design discharge conditions established in Subsection 210.03.b. For purposes of Subsection 210.03.c.iii., the term acute toxicity value is the toxicity test results, such as the concentration lethal one-half (1/2) of the test organisms (i.e., LC5O) after ninety-six (96) hours of exposure (e.g., fish toxicity tests) or the effect concentration to one-half of the test organisms, (i.e., EC5O) after forty-eight (48) hours of exposure (e.g., daphnia toxicity tests). For purposes of Subsection 210.03.c.iii., the term chronic value is the result from appropriate hypothesis testing or regression analysis of measurements of growth, reproduction, or survival from life cycle, partial life cycle, or early life stage tests. The determination of acute and chronic values shall be according to current standard protocols (e.g., those published by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)) or other comparable methods. For calculation of criteria using site-specific values for both the hardness and the water effect ratio, the hardness used in the equations in Subsection 210.02 shall be as required in Subsection 210.03.b. Water hardness shall be calculated from the measured calcium and magnesium ions present, and the ratio of calcium to magnesium shall be approximately the same in laboratory toxicity testing water as in the site water, or be similar to average ratios of laboratory waters used to derive the criteria.

The action is authorized by Sections 39-105, 39-107, and39-3601 et seq., Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: A public hearing concerning this proposed rulemaking will be held as follows: August 22, 2002, 6:30 p.m. Department of Environmental Quality Conference Center1410 N. Hilton, Boise, Idaho Before opening the record to receive oral comments, DEQ staff intends to make a brief presentation and answer questions regarding the rule. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made no later than five (5) days prior to the hearing. For arrangements, contact the undersigned at (208)373-0418. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: On June 20, 2002, the Idaho Board of Environmental Quality directed DEQ to proceed with rulemaking to amend the Idaho Water Quality Standards in response to a Petition to Initiate Rulemaking filed by the Idaho Association of Commerce and Industry. This proposed change to the Idaho Water Quality Standards adds a section to specify various methods to be used for evaluating whether water quality based effluentlimits are necessary in permits. This issue has been the subject of controversy in recent NPDES permits and the rule is necessary to assert the states interpretation of its water quality standards. The proposed changes to the Idaho Water Quality Standards add a section to identify the procedures to determine how to calculate values for the effluent concentration, background concentrations of pollutants in the receiving water and hardness values of the receiving water. These values are then used in calculations to determine if permit limits arenecessary and what permits limits should be used to assure that ambient water quality is protected. Methods for calculating values for effluent concentration are not addressed in federal regulations; therefore, this proposed rule may be broader in scope than federal law. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should beaddressed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to present the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in the fall of 2002 for adoption of a pending rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon the conclusion of the 2003 session of the Idaho Legislature. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Due to the nature of this rulemaking, negotiations were not held. The Board of Environmental Quality has directed DEQ to initiate rulemaking in response to a Petition for Initiation of Rulemakingfiled by the Idaho Association of Commerce and Industry. GENERAL INFORMATION: For more information about DEQ 's programs and activities, visit DEQ 's web site at www.state.id.us/deq.

These procedures are available for review at the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality, or may be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or U.S. Government Printing Office. (8-24-94) 01. Chemical And Physical Procedures . Sample collection, preservation and analytical procedures to determine compliance with these standards shall conform with the guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency, 40 CFR, Part 136, or other methods accepted by the scientific community and deemed appropriate by theDepartment. (8-24-94) 02. Metals Procedures . For the purposes of NPDES permitting, sample collection, preservation and analytical procedures for metals should conform to clean or ultra-clean techniques as described in: (8-24-94) a.\"Guidance Document on Clean Analytical Techniques and Monitoring, \" EPA, October 1993; or (8-24-94) b.\"Interim Guidance on Determination and Use of Water-Effect Ratios for Metals, \" EPA, February 1994; or (8-24-94) c.Other scientifically valid methods deemed appropriate by the Department. (8-24-94) 03. Reasonable Potential To Exceed (RPE) Water Quality Standards . ( ) a.For the purposes of evaluating whether water quality-based effluent limits are necessary in NPDES permits and Department certifications of NPDES permits, the Department shall utilize the following procedures for determining the reasonable potential to exceed (RPE) an instream water quality standard: ( ) i.The projected effluent quality shall be determined from the upper ninety-fifth percentile confidence level of the ninety-fifth percentile effluent concentration based on a log-normal distribution. ( ) ii.If representative upstream background concentration measurements in the receiving stream are available, the geometric mean of these measurements will be used for RPE calculation, unless it is determined that a different average statistic (i.e., arithmetic mean, fiftieth percentile) would be more representative of the upstream background concentration. If on-site background measurements are not available, the permittee may obtain this data or, alternatively, ambient data from similar streams may be used. ( ) iii.The statistic for hardness to be utilized in metals criteria equations is the geometric mean of a valid and representative database of downstream (mixed) hardness measurements. An alternate average statistic (i.e., arithmetic mean, fiftieth percentile) may be used if this value would be more representative of the downstream hardness. If downstream hardness measurements are not available, the downstream hardness may be calculated fromDEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0102-0205 Water Quality Standards/Wastewater Treatment Requirements Proposed Rulemaking IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 141 August 7, 2002 - Vol. 02-8a mass balance of geometric mean upstream hardness with geometric mean effluent hardness. ( ) b.If it is demonstrated that the permittee has a reasonable potential to exceed any instream water quality standard, then the procedures given in Subsections 090.03.a.ii. and 090.03.a.iii. shall also be used to calculate the permittee 's water quality-based effluent limits and any waste load allocation.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5226(1) and 67-5221(1), Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that the Board of Environmental Quality (Board) has adopted a temporary rule and the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) is commencing proposed rulemaking to promulgate a final rule. This rule regulates activities not regulated by the federal government. The action is authorized by Sections 39-105 and 39-107, and 39-119, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: No hearings have been scheduled. Pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hearing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency. Written requests for a hearing must be received by the undersigned on or before August 21, 2002. If no such written request is received, a public hearing will not be held. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: Department of Health and Welfare rule chapter IDAPA 16.05.05, \"Rules Governing Fees for Health and Environmental Operating Permits, Licenses and Inspection Services, \" contains sections imposing environmental fees which are no longer flexible enough to meet the needs of the different health districts. Under Docket No. 16-0505-0201, sections relating to the imposition of environmental fees, parcel surveys and sanitary restriction administration have been deleted from the Health and Welfare rule chapter. This rulemaking transfersthose sections to a new DEQ rule chapter to be cited an IDAPA 58.01.14, \"Rules Governing Fees for Environmental Operating Permits, Licenses and Inspection Services \". Language has been added to Section 100, Environmental Fees, giving health districts the necessary flexibility. This rulemaking allows local government and the health districts toadopt equivalent or more stringent fees to cover the services provided. Some units of local government have adopted environmental fee ordinances and some health districts have revised fee rules that were adopted under their boards ' rulemaking authority. The environmental fee structure needs to be flexible, across the state, to reflect the costs ofproviding environmental services rather than using a flat fee. Some health district environmental service costs are greater than other districts and the fees need to be reflective of the costs so that services can continue to be provided to the public. The districts with higher costs need the flexibility to revise fee structures to cover costs of providingservices. This proposed rule regulates activities that are not regulated by the federal government. This rulemaking proposes to amend long-standing administrative rules. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed. FEE SUMMARY: This rulemaking is a transfer of long-standing rule text relating to the imposition of environmental fees, parcel surveys and sanitary restriction administration from Department of Health and WelfareRule chapter IDAPA 16.05.05, \"Rules Governing Fees for Health and Environmental Operating Permits, Licenses and Inspection Services \" to new DEQ rule chapter IDAPA 58.01.14, \"Rules Governing Fees for Environmental Operating Permits, Licenses and Inspection Services \". Collection of the fees is authorized by Section 39-119, Idaho Code. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Due to the nature of this rulemaking, negotiations were not held. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Sections 67-5226(1)(c), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate in that the rule confers a benefit. Temporary adoption wouldbenefit local government, the health districts and the regulated community. By repealing the sections of the rule in IDAPA 16.05.05 that are related to programs administered by DEQ, and DEQ adopting the equivalent language for these sections, there is no increase in fees imposed by these actions. Language has been added to the generalEnvironmental Fees section that allows for local government or the health districts to adopt their own fees for services. Without the timely adoption of this rulemaking, there is a risk that health district fees could not be collected and necessary programs would not be adequately supported.DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0114-0201 Environmental Operating Permits, Licenses & Inspections Temporary & Proposed Rulemaking IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 190 August 7, 2002 - Vol. 02-8GENERAL INFORMATION: For more information about DEQ 's programs and activities, visit DEQ 's web site at www.state.id.us/deq.
