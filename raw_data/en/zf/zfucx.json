It is a way to develop resilience and release and let go of built-up stress, tension, and trauma. Shaking Medicine\u00ae is a body-based (somatic) approach to stress, tension, and trauma release. Practicing Shaking Medicine\u00ae not only helps to bring balance into our bodies (and life!) but releases deep-seated muscular tension, stress, and mild trauma. These monthly classes will enable you to understand your nervous system, and you will have a chance to learn and practice the Shaking Medicine\u00ae method. Come, shake it off and shake your way to good health! Shaking Medicine\u00ae is sometimes referred to as Bioenergetics or Trauma Release. It is one of the world's oldest self-help medicines. Shaking, rocking, vibration and oscillation are natural human reactions to: Stress, Trauma & Ecstatic states. Shaking Medicine\u00ae is, in short, the healing power of ecstatic movement. Inspired by and brought to us by nature. The practice of Shaking is known by many: Quakers, Gnostics, Taoists, Yoginis, First Nations peoples, Sufis, Druids, Zen Buddhists and more. We are inspired by teachers such as Peter Levine, Bradford Keeney, Osho, Wilhelm Reich, Alexander Lowen, John Peirakkos, David Bercelli.

In our work, meditation is not concentration, but relaxation. You will simply relax into the shaking. Simply relaxing into yourself. The more you relax, the more you feel yourself open and flexible. Relaxation means falling into such a strong state where you are not doing anything, you simply relax into the shaking. Shaking Medicine\u00ae is an organic, dynamic, rejuvenating practice that fuses the elements of movement and stillness to get you out of your head and into your body. This practice supports and inspires instinctual intelligence - a conduit for self-healing through accessing the body's nervous system for a safe, natural, well-being experience. As we shake, we remember how to let go of control and all effort, we relax, allowing ourselves to let go of anxieties and stress to help regulate emotions and develop greater resilience. In this class, you can expect to enhance your strength and flexibility, improve your energy levels, heal injuries through the stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system, reduce inflammation, improve your sleep, create energetic and emotional hygiene for overall well-being, promoting balance and harmony on a deep level. The music will support the experience. We end with a relaxation stage where you are invited to lay down, relax and let your whole Body-Mind system rest. Expect to expect nothing but what naturally arises and unravels as you tune in to what is real for you in any given moment. 1. Please come already dressed in comfortable clothing suitable for movement/fitness and dress in layers. Bring a set of dry clothes/small towel as you will probably get sweaty during the session. 2.

Shaking Medicine\u00ae is sometimes referred to as Bioenergetic Shaking, or Kundalini shaking. It is one of the worlds oldest self-help medicines. Shaking, rocking, vibration and oscillation are natural human reactions to: Stress, Trauma & Ecstatic states. We inherently use oscillation as a tool to calm our nervous system. for example, think of why we rock a crying baby to sleep. The practice of Shaking is known by many: Quakers, Gnostics, Taoists, Yoginis, First Nations peoples, Sufis, Buddhists and more. Shaking Medicine\u00ae is a Self-Healing body response to trauma as it can help to clear and release blocks that cause dis-ease. After a shaking the session, the body naturally shifts to a higher vibration and the shaking brings all of the body systems into balance. Shaking Medicine\u00ae is a wonderful way to let the body really move, shake up and release stress & tension, and bring in new fresh energy - revitalising yourself Body Heart & Soul. Shaking Medicine\u00ae is both 1) a contemporary somatic therapy practice for grounding and mobilising the Body-Mind. And 2) an ancient Shamanic technique for achieving non-ordinary states of consciousness - optional blindfolds available! One of the easiest ways to help the body release tension & stress is to shake. The simple act of shaking your body can produce a multitude of health benefits. Although it may seem simple, it is a very powerful technique. The main purpose of our Shaking Medicine classes is to relax the body and release tension. When we shake the body, we are relaxing all our joints, muscles, tendons and ligaments, helping us to loosen up and feel relaxed. Shaking gently bounces our organs and stimulates our lymphatic system. Our lymphatic system is like our bodies draining system and is responsible for the removal of waste material from every cell in the body, in addition to regulating the immune system. Maintaining a healthy lymphatic system is critical if we want to be radiant and healthy. Shaking also benefits our circulatory system. Most of us hold on to a lot of tension in the body, especially around the neck, shoulders and back area. Poor posture, sitting on chairs and sofas for extended periods of time, stress and even negative thought patterns and emotional blockages can all contribute to the build-up stress and tension in the body. We spend our days hunched over computers, our heads locked on to our iphone screens, then we go home and slouch on the sofa to watch TV for hours. Our fast-paced, stress-filled lifestyles leave us feeling 'uptight' and most of us can never fully relax. If we allow this tension to build up in our bodies if can manifest itself as pain, stiffness, inflammation, and disease.
