BACKGROUND Various chemicals are still used in the manufacture of building materials, despite known or suspected health hazards. Flame retardant chemicals, which are used to increase fire-resistance of materials, include PBDEs (polybrominated diphenyl ethers)\u2014which, based on animal tests, are associated with potential neurobehavioral, carcinogenic and immune effects. Some of these chemicals can bioaccumulate in fat and result in food chain contamination, including human milk. All parts of this feature only apply to materials installed inside the weather proofing membrane of a project. Halogenated flame retardants are limited in the following components to 0.01% (100 ppm) to the extent allowable by local code: a.36 Window and waterproofing membranes, door and window frames and siding. b.36 Flooring, ceiling tiles and wall coverings. c.36 Piping and electrical cables, conduits and junction boxes. d.36 Duct, pipe, acoustic and thermal insulation. e.36 Upholstered furniture furnishings, textiles and fabrics. DEHP, [PVC]) are limited in the following components to 0.01% (100 ppm): a.36 Flooring, including resilient and hard surface flooring and carpet. b.36 Wall coverings, window blinds and shades, shower curtains, furniture and upholstery. c.36 Plumbing pipes and moisture barriers.
