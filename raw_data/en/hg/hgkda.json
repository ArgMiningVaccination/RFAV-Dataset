Immune Booster Hydrotherapy We all get sick at some point and often our immune systems are fatigued from lack of sleep or vital nutrients that may be lacking in our dietary intake. By receiving our immune booster infusion therapy, clients can have peace of mind that they are receiving a supplement of vitamins that are key to keeping the immune system healthy. This will aid the body in mounting a natural immune response to help fight some of the everyday invaders of our bodies such as the common cold. Whether you feel the early signs of a viral illness or are suffering from symptoms, we can provide the immune booster to help the body better fight off offensive systemic offenders. The body's immune system is one of the most intricate systems within the body that we rely upon without realizing just how much we need to protect it. The good news is that you can boost your body's immune system in a number of ways, including through using hydrotherapy. How to Boost Your Immune System Through Hydrotherapy Hydrotherapy is a form of therapy that utilizes hot or cold water of varying pressures as well as steam. This form of therapy can be given through: - Baths and/or showers - A hot tub - A sauna - Swimming pools - Whirlpool spas - Physical therapy tanks Your body uses the immune system to create a natural barrier to help fight antigens that cause infection in the body. Therefore, helping to boost your body's immune system will help to stop foreign invaders from entering the body and wreaking havoc. Having a healthy immune system has many benefits, including helping the body to fight infection, recover more quickly, reduce fatigue, and promote a more healthy quality of sleep. How Does Hydrotherapy Work? Hydrotherapy works by using hot and/or cold water to improve blood circulation, white blood cell circulation, and lymph production to decrease fatigue, support the body's healing, and increase the immune system. Coldwater hydrotherapy restricts the blood flow and aids in healing inflammation while hot water dilates the vessels to reduce pain and stiffness. There are several things that hydrotherapy can help with. Water allows your body to become weightless as you float, helping to increase movement in your joints, alleviate pain and pressure throughout your body, and provide enough resistance as you move to improve muscle strength. Hydrotherapy can be administered in many ways, both at a facility that specializes in this form of therapy as well as at home, such as through: - Soaking in a warm or cool bath: with bath salts, essential oils, or other minerals to promote a healthy immune system. - A cold or hot compress: allowing for targeted hydrotherapy for alleviation of symptoms in a specific area. - Water circuit therapy: involves the person going through more than one form of hydrotherapy back to back and alternating between warm water and cold water. Various techniques are used, such as a warm bath, a cool bath, and a sauna. - Immersion therapy: allows the person to fully submerge themselves in the water through a warm bath, hot tub, whirlpool bath, or swimming pool for full-body symptom relief.
