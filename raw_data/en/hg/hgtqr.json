This is an easy recipe for crystallized ginger that can be tweaked to fit your dietary needs. You can pack some ginger pieces in an airtight sandwich bag and carry them around with you. Ingredients 1 cup ginger (peeled, thinly sliced) 3 cups water 1 cup sugar + 2 tbsps sugar Preparation In a covered saucepan, bring the water to a boil. Add the ginger pieces and 1 cup sugar and cover. Reduce the heat and allow it to simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and allow it to sit for 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 200F. Strain ginger slices and place in a glass pan. Place the pan in the oven until the slices are almost dry but still chewy. Allow it to cool. Toss the cooled ginger in sugar to lightly coat it Variations and Substitutions If you don't want to use sugar in this recipe, boil the ginger in water without adding the sugar. Instead of tossing the cooled ginger in sugar to lightly coat it, sprinkle stevia or another sugar alternative over the ginger pieces to taste. You can also omit the final step and use the ginger without any sugar coating. Cooking and Serving Tips Save time by peeling ginger with a spoon. Simply scrape the spoon across the ginger skin to peel it away. When slicing ginger for this recipe, remember that the pieces will shrink during preparation. If you don't prefer slices, you can also chop the ginger into small cubes or matchsticks. If have a food processor, use it to slice ginger into perfect slices. Save the cooking water after cooking the ginger. Boil it down to make a ginger-flavored simple syrup. Add the syrup to sparkling water or your favorite beverage. Dip ginger pieces in melted chocolate then let them cool for a delicious and easy-to-carry treat. Chop up crystallized ginger into small pieces to add to muffin, cookie, or bread batter. Use it in savory a stir fry with pork or chicken or a variety of vegetables. Make a batch of rice pudding and top it with chopped crystallized ginger. Add it to a cheese board or charcuterie plate with other dried fruits, such as dried fig. Add to cranberry sauce instead of (or along with) orange zest.
