David Colquhoun, University College London This document provides some of the evidence about what is taught to students on the sort of course that the Pittilo report wishes to make com pulsory. It is quite clear when you look at the actual content of the BSc (Hon s) that he recommends as proper training that what is taught endangers the public. This has largely escaped attention because universities who teach this sort of stuff try to keep it secret, and because the bureaucratic mentality finds it easier to tick boxes than to do the necessary investigation. Here is an extract from a handout about \"Zangfu (internal organs)\" used in the BSc (Hons) Chinese Medicine at the University of W estminster. It is about the spleen and it is utter nonsense. It is important to remember that this is not being taught as an interesting ancient myth that arose before anything was known about the spleen. It is being taught as a basis for treating sick p eople in 2009. It forms a basis for treatment that endangers patients. Spleen The main functions of the Spleen are as follows; 1. Controls Transformation and Transportation (T&T) of qi Transformation here means the actual process of digestion and absorption. The Spleen digests the food and absorbs the essential substances along with part of the fluid supplied by the Stomach. It then transmits these substances to the Lung and He art from where they are sent to nourish the whole body. The Spleen receives ingested food and then separates the pure from the relatively impure. The impure parts are passed on to the Small Intestine, Large Intestine and Bladder for further processing. The pure part qi (gu qi ) is sent up to the Lungs where it combines with air to form zong qi and then further on to the Heart where it helps form Blood (with the aid of yuan qi ). The Spleen is seen as the root of post -heaven essence ( houtian zhi jing ) and the production of qi and blood. . . . 2. Rules/controls the muscles and limbs The Spleen function of T&T means that in a normal healthy body there is sufficient qi and blood to nourish the muscles and flesh (strong, sufficient bulk), and the muscl es will be warm, energized and firm. 3. Governs/controls Blood Spleen has a controlling role to play in the holding of blood within the vessels and its proper pathways. 4. Controls the Raising of Qi' (helps hold the organs in place) Spleen is said t o help keep the organs in place, mainly due the action of the qi being sent upward to the Lungs which is said to help keep the organs in place. If this function is weakened, then prolapse can occur. 5. Opens into the Mouth and manifests in the Lips. Spleen has a functional relationship to the mouth and its surrounding muscles via eating. If the Spleen is healthy the mouth can discern the 5 flavours and the lips are red and moist. 6. Houses Thought. (and it is affecte d by pensiveness/over thinking) 2 Here is a slide from a nother lecture on traditional Chinese medicine ( more here ). After the usual myths abo ut \"Qi\" we come to a real patient. At the top, the patient is described Treat with ginger and moxa ? When this appeared on my blog it attracted th is comment \"The University of Westminster \"diag nosis\" described above is actually extremely worrying. Plainly this is a woman of child bearing age, and there is a possibility of an ectopic pregnancy, with bleeding being mistaken for a period. This requires immediate medical referral. Alternatively, the re could be endometriosis or a variety of cancers. The advice to scan for fibroids suggests neither necessity nor urgency. Waiting 3 cycles while moxibustion makes no difference could lead to sterility, serious illness or worse.\" This sort mockery of me dicine is very dangerous to patients who get into the hands of people trained in this way. Diagnosis Woman presenting with painful periods, focused contracting pain in central abdomen, dark blood with black clots . . . 3 An examination paper in acupuncture This exam paper was set by the University of Salford in 2009, though the university has now closed down the course for which it was set. This is really quite absurd . The students are being seriously mislead. The students on this degree are spending three years memorising things like these that are simply untrue. 4 And one more question, It seems that in the 21st century, acupuncture students are being taught the crudest sort of ideas about vital spirits. It is important to remember that students are not being taught this has history or myth, but as a basis for going out to treat sick people. This sort of prop erly trained practitioner is a danger to patients. . 5 A Chinese medicine lecture Again this lecture is from the University of Westminster. These first four slides contradict directly all that has been learned about physiology and anatomy in the last few 100 years It gets even worse, 6 The students are taught that marrow fills the brain. This is so absurd as to leave one speechless. Anyone who believes them (as required to pass the degree) is a menace to the safety of patients , 7 A lecture on herbal approaches for patients with cancer This lecture is perhaps the most shocking example so far. It is not only totally devoid of evidence but it provides a direct incitement to make claims that are illegal under the Cancer Act 1939 This second slide (slide 3) is quite outrageous. It certainly poses a huge danger to patients . It is a direct incentive to make illegal, and untrue claims by using weasel words in an attempt to stay just on the right side of the law. But that, sadl y, is standard practice in alternative medicine, Slide 11 is mostly meaningless. \"Strengthen vitality\" sounds good but means nothing. And \"enhancing the immune system\" is what alternative medicine advocates always say when they can think of nothing else . Its meaning is ill -defined and there is no reason to think that any herbs do it. The idea of a tonic was actually quite common in real medicine in the 1950s. The term slowly vanished as it was realised that it was a figment of the imagination. In the fantasy world of alternative medicine, it lives on. 8 Detoxification, a marketing term not a medical one, has been extensively debunked quite recently. The use of the word by The Prince of Wales c ompany , Duchy Originals recently fell foul of the Advertising Standards Authority , and his herbal remedies were zapped by the MHRA ( Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority). And of course it is well -known that the antioxidant myth is a long -disproved hypoth esis that ha s become a mere marketing term. \"Inhibits the recurrence of cancer\" ! That sounds a direct claim for a curative effect. But if it is so good why is it not even mentioned in the two main resources for information about herbs? In the UK we have the National Library for Health Complementary and Alternative Medicine Specialist Library (NeLCAM), now a part of NHS Evidence. It was launched in 2006 . The clinical lead was none other than Peter Fisher , clinical director of the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, and the Queens homeopathic physician. The library was developed with the School of Integrated Health at the University of Westminster (where this particular slide was shown to undergraduates). Nobody could accuse these people of being hostile to alternative medicine, It seems odd, then, that NeLCAM does not seem to t hnk to think that Centella asiatica , is even worth mentioning. In the USA we have the National Center for Alternative and Complementary Medicine (NCCAM), an organisation that is so friendly to alternative medicine that it has spent a billion dollars on re search in the area, though it has produced not a single good treatment for that vast expenditure. But NCCAM too does not even mention Centella asiatica in its herb list . It does ge t a mention in Cochrane reviews but only as a cosmetic cream and as an unproven treatment for poor venous circulation in the legs. Nothing at all about cancer. 9 The term \"lymph remedy\" has no well-defined meaning at all. It seems to be just another marketing term? \"especially valuable in the treatment of breast, throat and uterus cancer. \" That is a very dramatic claim. It as as though the hapless students were being tutored in doublespeak. What is meant by \"especially valuable in the treatment of\"? Clearly a desperate patient would interpret those words as meaning that there was at least a chance of a cure. That would be a wicked deception because there isnt the slightest reason to think it works . Once again there this \"cure\" is not ev en mentioned in either NELCAM or NCCAM. Phytolacca is mentioned, as Pokeweed, in Wikipedia but no claims are mentioned even there. And it isnt mentioned in Cochrane reviews either. The dramatic claims are utterly unfounded. They are probably illegal too . But students must learn them to pass the exam. Mistletoe is one of the more common things used in alternative medicine. NHS Evidence (NeLCAM) lists three completed assessments . One concludes that more research is needed. Another con cludes that \"Rigorous trials of mistletoe extracts fail to demonstrate efficacy of this therapy\", and the third says \"The evidence from RCTs to support the view that the application of mistletoe extracts has impact on survival or leads to an improved abili ty to fight cancer or to withstand anticancer treatments is weak\". 10 NCCAM says of mistletoe More than 30 human studies using mistletoe to treat cancer have been done since the early 1960s, but major weaknesses in many of these have raised doubts about their findings (see Question 6 ). Very few bad side effects have been reported fr om the use of mistletoe extract, though mistletoe plants and berries are poisonous to humans (see Question 7 ). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved mistletoe as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition (see Question 8 ). The FDA does not allow injectable mistletoe to be imported, sold, or used except for clinical research (see Question 8 ). Cochrane reviews lists several reviews of mistletoe with similar conclusions. For example \"The evidence from RCTs to support the view that the application of mistletoe extracts has impact on survival or leads to an improved ability to fight cancer or to withstand anticancer trea uterine, breast, lung \". A cure for lung cancer? That, of course, depends on how you interpret the weasel words \"indicated for\". Even Wikipedia makes no mention of any claims that Thuja benefits cancer. NHS Evidence (NeLCAM) doesnt mention Thuja for any indication. Neither does NCCAM. Nor Cochrane reviews. That is not the impression the hapless students of this BSc l ecture were given. In my view suggestions that you can cure lung cancer with this tree are just plain wicked. 11 This mixture is pure snake oil, and it isnt eve n spelled correctly, Harry Hoxseys treatment centres in the USA were closed by court order in the 1950s. But it is being taught to herbal medicine students in 2009. More unfounded claims when it says \"treated successfully many cancer patients\". No references and no data to support the claim. It is utterly unfounded and claims t o the contrary endanger the public. 12 Gerson therapy is one of the most notorious and unpleasant of the quack cancer treatments. The Gerson Institute is on San Diego, but their clinics are in Mexico and Hungary. It is illegal in the USA . According to the American Cancer Society you get \"a strict low -salt, low - fat, vegetarian diet and drinking juice from about twenty pounds of fresh fruits an d vegetables each day. One glass of juice is consumed each hour, thirteen times a day. In addition, patients are given several coffee enemas each day. Various supplements, such as potassium, vitamin B12, pancreatic enzymes, thyroid hormone, and liver extra cts, are used to stimulate organ function, particularly of the liver and thyroid.\". At one time you also got several glasses of raw calf liver every day but after infections killed several people] carrot juice was given instead. Cancer Research UK says \"there is no evidence to show that Gerson therapy works as a cure for cancer\", and \"The Gerson diet can cause some very serious side effects.\" Nobody (except perhaps the Price of Wales) has any belief in this unpleasant, toxic and expensive folk -lore. Again patients are endangered by teaching this sort of stuff. And finally, the last slide in the lecture diverts from the topic to make the usual swipe at vaccines. It s nothing to do with herbalism, but just about every alternative medicine advocate seems to subscribe to the anti -vaccination lobby.. It is almost as though they have an active prefere nce for things that are known to be wrong. They seem to believe that medicine and science are 13 part of an enormous conspiracy to kill everyone. Perhaps this dangerous propaganda might have been ameliorated if the students had been shown this slide ( from a talk by Melinda Wharton about CDC numbers ). Lectures like this consistently preach against vaccination. The \"education\" that students get in this so rt of degree, if it were taken seriously , would result in people dying still from smallpox, diphtheria. tetanu s and rabies, This is the sort of education which the Pittilo report wants to make compulsory. Conclusion This selection of slides shows that much of the material that is taught in degrees in herbal medicine and Chinese medicine poses a real danger to public safety and to public health. "}
