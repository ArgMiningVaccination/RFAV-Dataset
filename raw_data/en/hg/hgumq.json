You will need to bring documents about yourself, your family, and your current financial situation at this intake appointment. These documents are listed below. Intake assessment: at this first meeting, a social supports coordinator will: - Review your situation and see if you qualify for Social Assistance; - Explain the program to you and answer your questions; - Complete your application with you and review your documents to make sure they include the information required to properly assess your needs; and - Ask you to sign the Applicant Declaration. This is a legal document that you must sign as part of your application. The social supports coordinator will explain the document and answer your questions to make sure you fully understand it before you sign. By signing the applicant declaration, you agree to: - Follow the rules of the Social Assistance program; and - Allow program staff to verify your information.

You are responsible to provide your social support coordinator with current information about your needs and income and report any changes to your situation, i.e. your relationship status changes, you have more or fewer children in your care, or your employment or income changes. You may be assessed as needing to meet basic needs and you may qualify for assistance for other needs. Basic needs include: - Food; - Clothing; - Household items; - Personal Items; - Telephone or internet costs; - Shelter; and - Utilities (power, heat, fuel and water).
