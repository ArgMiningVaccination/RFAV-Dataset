Rifle or Shotgun? Single Herbs Have deep and subtle acGons, aecGng mulGple systems and processes When matched correctly to a person's symptoms have powerful targeted acGon (like a rifle) Require a lot of knowledge and skill to use eecGvely Herbal Formulas Subtle acGons tend to balance out, creaGng a more generalized acGon Have a more generalized acGon that aects the body in a more diverse way (like a shotgun) Require less knowledge and skill to use eecGvely Herbal Recipes Like creaGng a single dish from a recipe of ingredients, an herbal formula is more than the sum of the single acGons of its ingredients Herbs can both enhance and neutralize the eects of other herbs, so the blend is dierent than the sum of its parts People unskilled in herbalism oQen create \"kitchen sink\" formulas where they simply blend together everything that has been historically used for a problem thinking that will x everything Herbal EnergeGcs Herbs have \"energeGc\" properGes that move the body's energies in certain direcGons, as follows: -Energy ProducGon: Herbs can warm (speed up metabolism) or cool (slow down metabolism) -Minerals and Fluids: Herbs can moisten Gssues or can relax Gssues or constrict (tone) Gssues Herbs and Body Systems Herbs have anity for various body systems and funcGons Formulas can be blended to support specic body systems in both structure and funcGon, such as: -DigesGve formulas -Respiratory formulas -Urinary formulas formulas 9/18/14 2 Herbal ProperGes Herbs have certain properGes, which are used to describe ways they aect structure and funcGon Herbs can be blended by combining remedies with similar properGes, such as: -Nervines -Blood puriers FormulaGon Principles Herbal formulas will be more therapeuGc in their eects when herbs are combined according to common energeGcs or properGes, so that they move the body's energies in a unied direcGon Herbal formulas will be more nourishing in their eects when herbs are combined in ways that cancel out their energeGc eects, so they don't move the body's energies strongly in any direcGon A Plan for Designing Formulas Components 1-\u00ad2 Key Herbs (8-\u00ad16 parts per herb) 2-\u00ad4 SupporGng Herbs (4-\u00ad8 parts per herb) 0-\u00ad3 Balancing Herbs (2-\u00ad4 parts per herb) 0-\u00ad2 Catalysts (1-\u00ad2 parts per herb) Example 8 oz. Key Herb 4 oz. SupporGng Herb 1 4 oz. SupporGng Herb 2 2 oz. SupporGng Herb 3 2 oz. Balancing Herb 1 1 oz. Balancing Herb 2 1 oz. Catalyst Key Herb(s) The key herb(s) has the primary acGon you want in the formula, which can be: -EnergeGc -Body System Anity -Property -A CombinaGon of the Above The key herb is like the king or emperor of the formula; it directs the acGon of the other ingredients SupporGng Herb(s) SupporGng herbs are like the kings advisors They may have a similar acGon to the key herb(s) or may somehow enhance that acGon They may also \"ll in\" eects wanted in the formula that are not supplied by the key herb(s) Balancing Herbs Balancing herbs are added to a formula to restrain undesirable properGes of the key herb, such as: -Toning down harsh or unwanted acGons -Masking unpleasant flavors TCM formulas usually contain small quanGGes of herbs with opposite eects of the main herbs to ensure the eect of the formula isn't too harsh 9/18/14 3 Catalysts Catalysts are herbs that are added in very small amounts to enhance the overall eect of the formula Common Lobelia Catalysts: Capsicum, Fennel, Ginger ArGchoke, Myrrh Gum, Turkey Rhubarb, Burdock, Irish Moss, Licorice, Anise Catalysts: EssenGal oils Example 4: Cardiac Tonic Key Herbs: Hawthorn, Lily of the Valley, Arjuna Suppor9ng wort, Chamomile, Licorice Catalysts: Black Pepper, Ginger 9/18/14 4 Example 6: Fiber Herbs: Psyllium Plantain, Balancing A Dash of Experience Learning to blend herbs is a lot like learning to be a great cook It's not about strictly following a recipe It's more about knowing your ingredients well and being able to adjust them to get the eect you want A Few of My Favorite Formulas Children's ComposiGon 2 parts Yarrow (key herb) 2 parts Elder Flower (key herb) 2 parts Peppermint (supporGng and balancing herb) 1 part Elderberry (opt.) (supporGng and balancing herb) 1 part Chamomile (opt.) (catalyst) Dry Cough 4 parts Mullein Flower (key herb) 4 parts Marshmallow (key herb) 2 parts Licorice (supporGng herb) 2 parts Elderberry (supporGng herb) 1 part Peppermint (balancing herb and catalyst) 9/18/14 5 Damp Cough Formula 4 parts Wild Cherry Bark (key herb) 4 parts White Pine Bark (key herb) 2 parts Plantain (supporGng herb) 2 parts Grindelia (supporGng herb) 1 part Cinnamon (balancing herb and catalyst) \u00bd part Lobelia (catalyst) Herbal Minerals 4 parts Negle Leaf (key herb) 4 parts Alfalfa (key herb) 2 parts Horsetail (supporGng herb) 2 parts Oat straw (supporGng herb) 1 part Red Raspberry (supporGng herb) 1 part Peppermint (balancing herb and catalyst) \u00bd part Dill (balancing herb and catalyst) LymphaGc Formula 4 Echinacea (key herb) 4 Red Root (key herb) 4 Elder Berry (balancing herb) 2 Yarrow (supporGng herb) 1 Thyme (catalyst) Tummy Tonic 4 Catnip (key herb) 4 Fennel (key herb) 2 Meadowsweet (supporGng herb) 1 Peppermint (supporGng herb and catalyst) 1/2 Lobelia (catalyst) (opt.) A Dose of Common Sense Just as you can adjust a recipe with dierent ingredients, the specic ingredients in a blend are less important than the overall result You don't have to be precise with herbal remedies except when dealing with toxic botanicals There's a wide margin of safety in both preparaGon and dosage "}
