Because we realizethat today's students lead complex lives and must juggle multiple roles as student, parent, employee, and spouse, wedeveloped this textbook, with its accompanying electronicancillaries, to present the critical components of maternitynursing in a clear and concise format that lends itself to ease of comprehension while maintaining the integrity of the sub-stantive content. It may be particularly useful for programsdesigned to present the subject of maternity in an abbreviatedor condensed way. We revised the textbook based on the recommendations of those who have used it\u2014faculty from various states andstudents in all types of programs\u2014and our own experiences.Revisions include enhanced rationale for nursing actions in allchapters, increased content in pathophysiology in many areas,and expanded high-risk content. We have updated content to keep current in standards in practice, including new guide-lines for management of postpartum hemorrhage, manage-ment of intrapartal fetal heart rate abnormalities, assessmentand care of the late preterm infant, and assessment and careof the newborn with hyperbilirubinemia. We have expandedsections on patient education, patient teaching resources, andcomplementary and alternative therapies. Professional stan-dards of care for maternity nurses are based on current prac-tice guidelines and research. ORGANIZATION This evidence-based text utilizes theory and clinical knowl-edge of maternity nursing. The conceptual framework isFamily Developmental Theory, and substantive theory thatforms the foundation for maternity care is presented. Thebook is organized according to the natural sequence of theperinatal cycle, pregnancy, labor and birth, postpartum, andneonate. We have taken a bio-psycho-social approach dealingwith the physiological, psychological adaptation, social, andcultural influences impacting childbearing families, withemphasis on nursing actions and care of women and families.We believe childbirth is a natural, developmental process. Nursing is an ever-changing science. New research and clinical knowledge expand knowledge and change clinicalpractice. Maternal-Newborn Nursing: The Critical Components of Nursing Care reflects current knowledge, standards, and trends in maternity services, including the trend toward higherlevels of intervention in maternity care. These standards andtrends are reflected in our inclusion of a chapter on tests dur-ing the antepartal period, as well as a chapter devoted to fetalassessment and electronic fetal monitoring. We have devoteda chapter to the care of cesarean birth families; nearly one-third of births in the United States are cesarean. FEATURES This textbook presents the critical components of maternity ina pragmatic condensed format by using the following features:Information presented in a bulleted format for ease ofreading Flowcharts, diagrams, tables, clinical pathways, and conceptmaps to summarize information Case studies to assist integration of knowledge Audio Book In an effort to help students manage their time more effec-tively, each book comes with access to downloadable audiofiles that contain recorded abridged versions of chapters forstudents to listen to while commuting to and from classes andclinical. Students can use these audio files to reinforce thecontent in the text, to refresh their reading before class, or toreview for an exam. The audio files provide two ways of learn-ing in one product. Critical Components This textbook focuses on the critical components of mater-nity nursing. Critical components are the major areas ofknowledge essential for a basic understanding of maternitynursing. The critical components were determined from theauthors' combined 50 years of teaching maternity nursingin both traditional and accelerated programs and years ofclinical practice in the maternity setting. Current guidelinesand standards are integrated and summarized for a prag-matic approach to patient and family-focused care. Thisfocus is especially evident when discussing complications ordeviations from the norm. The focus of the text is on normal pregnancy and childbirth. Chapters on low-risk antenatal, intrapartal, postpartum, andneonate are followed by chapters on high risk and complica-tions in each area. Complications germane to the nursingdomain and childbearing population focus on understandingand synthesizing the critical elements for nursing care. Care of Cesarean Birth Families Approximately one-third of births are by cesarean section. Inresponse to this increased trend, this book has dedicated achapter to the intrapartum and postpartum care 16/09/13 10:31 Page viiPreface viii Chapter Format This textbook clusters physiological changes, nursing assess-ment, and nursing care content in each chapter. Typically, achapter is divided into systems in which the physiology; nurs-ing care, including assessment and interventions; expectedoutcomes; and common deviations of one subsystem are pre-sented. Psychosocial and cultural dimensions of nursing careare highlighted in each chapter. Flowcharts, Diagrams, Tables, Concept Maps, and Clinical Pathways Flowcharts, tables, concept maps, and clinical pathwayspresent large amounts of information in a clear and conciseformat. Case Studies Two case studies, one low-risk and one high-risk, are presentedin the unit on antepartal care; these are developed further insubsequent chapters. These case studies are presented at theend of each chapter as a strategy to summarize the key elementsof the chapter, to assist the students in their development ofcritical thinking skills, and to help them integrate the contentinto clinical practice. The development of the case studies over multiple content areas\u2014antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum\u2014allows stu-dents to analyze the assessment data in relationship to nursingcare. This type of teaching/learning activity helps bring content\"to life\" for students as they synthesize new knowledge. Review Questions Review question appear at the end of each chapter to helpstudents review key chapter content. Teaching Cards Teaching cards are provided as an electronic resource to helpstudents instruct patients and families. The cards summarizeand organize information on key topics related to mother andbaby care and discharge teaching and planning. The teachingcards have details regarding newborn care and feeding andpostpartum self-care as well as warning signs and guidanceabout when to call the health-care practitioner. Special Features A variety of boxes appears throughout the chapters to high-light information:Critical Component: Highlights critical information in maternal-newborn nursing Medication: Highlights the commonly administered medications used during pregnancy, labor and birth,postpartum, and neonatal periods Cultural Awareness: Stresses the importance of cultural factors in nursing care Evidenced-Based Practice: Highlights current research and practice guidelines related to nursing careStandards of Care and Professional Position Statements: Highlights key perinatal nursing issues from professionalorganizations such as Association of Women's Health,Obstetic and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN) Quality and Safety Education in Nursing (QSEN):Highlights QSEN concepts as they apply to the chaptercontent Glossary For ease of looking up definitions, there is a glossary of termsused in the book related to maternal-newborn nursing. Appendixes The appendixes include:AWHONN guide to breastfeeding Common and standard laboratory values for pregnantand nonpregnant women and the neonate Temperature equivalents Cervical dilation chart Newborn weight conversion chart Immunization and pregnancy table IMPORTANT FEATURES FOR INSTRUCTORS The nursing shortage resulted in the widespread develop-ment and expansion of nursing programs. Many nursingprograms, which can be as short as 12 months, now teachmaternity nursing in a compact or abbreviated format.Faculty are challenged to develop courses with fewer creditunits to be taught in 5 or fewer weeks. This requires a criti-cal analysis to identify essential components of the subjectarea and the appropriate teaching-learning resources.Maternity nursing textbooks are not designed for currentapproaches to nursing education at the associate, traditionalbaccalaureate, accelerated baccalaureate, or entry-level mas-ters' nursing programs. This textbook addresses the realityof nursing education today and presents the critical compo-nents of maternity in a pragmatic, condensed format withancillary course materials to facilitate student learning andfaculty teaching of maternity nursing. Current nursing students comprise a diverse group and many are older, more mature learners. They may enter a nurs-ing program with prior degrees and work experience in fieldsoutside of nursing. Most students want materials presented ina clear and concise format that allows them to use their criti-cal thinking skills to integrate the new knowledge into theirprevious knowledge base and life experiences. Because somenursing students have completed their transition to adult-hood, they are believed by education experts to be betterpoised to master the knowledge they need to arrive at clinicaljudgments and ethical and moral decisions inherent in nursing practice. Utilization of critical elements, mapping,evidenced-based practice guidelines, and focused activitieswill satisfy the needs of these specialized learners who areintolerant of \"busy work\" and extraneous material.3704_FM_i-xxiv 16/09/13 10:31 AM Page viiiPreface ix The theme for the new millennium in nursing educations is \"We can no longer teach as we were taught.\" That includesteaching in shorter periods for both theory and clinical andteaching for understanding of critical elements. This bookresponds to innovations in nursing curricula and the new pop-ulation of nursing students. The ancillary products for this text respond to needs and learning styles of current students. For example, some nursingstudents are already college graduates with academic, life, andwork experience contributing to their critical thinking andability to synthesize complex information and seek evidenced-based solutions to clinical problems. The ancillary resourcesallow them to utilize a variety of technology-based resourcesin place of outdated, more traditional approaches used inother maternity textbooks. Supplemental instructor aids for theory class include: An 8-week syllabus guide Detailed classroom activities for each content area PowerPoint slides Image bank Fully developed and integrated case studies with criticalthinking activities and rationales both for high and low risk. Interactive case studies for students to improve criticalthinking and priority setting Animations to enhance visual learning and application Interactive online student exercises Exam test bank with over 500 updated questions inExamViewPro with item descriptors Activities using Internet resources Supplemental instructor materials for clinical include: Detailed clinical syllabus for inpatient and community-based perinatal settings Clinical integration activities, with critical thinking activ-ities and directions on implementation including:Family study: format and directions for a community-based postpartum home family study for clinical students Topics for clinical integration seminars Expectant parent interview activity Teaching cards for use with postpartum families Medication cards Skill laboratory exercises Chart review exercises Clinical preparation tools Antepartal data collection worksheet Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) data collectionworksheet P ostpartum data collection worksheet Labor and delivery data collection worksheet Newborn assessment worksheet Nursing care plans for postpartum and and delivery3704_FM_i-xxiv 16/09/13 10:31 AM Page ixRoberta Durham, RN, PhD, is Professor at California State University, East Bay, inHayward, California, and a Professor Alumnus at Samuel Merritt University in Oakland,California.

The present trend in an increase in both cesarean births and induction of labor is a significant change in the approach tolabor and birth. Management of labor and birth has movedfrom the low use of obstetrical interventions in the naturalchildbirth era that began in the 1960s to high use of obstetricalinterventions and to a more controlled event. The impetus forthis shift has been a childbearing generation whose membersembrace technology and who have a desire to control when andhow their children are born. The scheduling and method ofchildbirth are also influenced by physicians' preferences. Changes have also occurred in fertility and birthrates, preterm rates, neonatal birth weight rates, infant mortalityrates, and maternal death and mortality rates. Fertility and Birthrates Fertility rate is \"the total number of live births, regardless of age of mother, per 1,000 women of reproductive age, 15-44 years\"(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2007).Birthrate is the number of live births per 1,000 people (CDC, 2007). It is estimated that in 2011 the U.S. birthrate was rankednumber 148 out of 221 countries with a birthrate of 13.83 (CIA,2011). The following is a sample ranking of other countries:Niger is ranked 1 with a rate of 50.54. Egypt is ranked 64 with rate of 24.63. Mexico is ranked 102 with a rate of 19.13. Australia is ranked 158 with a rate of 12.33. The United Kingdom is ranked 161 with a rate of 12.29. Canada is ranked 186 with a rate of 10.28. Japan is ranked 220 with a rate of 7.31. Monaco is ranked 221 with a rate of 6.94 (CIA, 2011).In the United States, there was a 49% decrease in the fer- tility rate and a 57% decrease in the birthrate between 1910and 2010 (Table 1-2). During this period, the fertility ratedecreased from 126.8 to 64.1 live births per 1,000 womenbetween the ages of 15 and 44. The birthrate during this sameperiod decreased from 30.1 to 13.0 live births per 1,000. The decline in fertility rates and birthrates from 1910 to 2010 may be attributed to:Availability of a variety of contraceptive methods with ahigh effectiveness rate Increased numbers of women delaying and/or limitingpregnancy/children to focus on careers3704_Ch01_001-012 03/10/13 2:47 PM Page 1UNIT 1 Maternity Nursing Overview 2 Legalization and availability of elective abortions Couples limiting number of children due to rising cost ofraising childrenAn interesting trend is noted for the 20-year period from 1990 to 2010 (Table 1-3). The birthrates decreased forwomen age 15-29 but increased for women age 30-45 and older. The greatest increase was seen in women ages 40 years and older. The greatest decrease was in women ages15-19 years. In the United States in 2010, there were a total 4,000,279 births; a birthrate of 13.0. The percentages of these births byrace are:American Indian or al., 2011).These percentages reflect the multicultural population of the United States and present an exciting challenge to healthcare workers to adapt their care to reflect an understanding ofthe health care beliefs and cultural practices of a wide varietyof childbearing families. Preterm Births Very premature: Neonates born at less than 32 weeks of gestation Moderately premature: Neonates born between 32 and 33 weeks of gestation Late premature: Neonates born between 34 and 37 weeks of gestation (Hamilton et al., 2006).TABLE 1-1 PAST AND PRESENT TRENDS PAST TRENDS PRESENT TRENDS Nursing: Focus on physiological changes and needs of the mother and infant Primarily home birthsWomen labored in one room and delivered in another room Delivery rooms \"cold and sterile\"Expectant fathers and family excluded from the labor and birth experience Expectant fathers excluded from cesarean births Labor pain management: Amnesia or \"twilight sleep\" to natural childbirth Hospital postpartum stay of 10 daysInfant mortality rate of 58.1 per 1,000 live births in 1933 (Kochanek & Martin, 2004) Maternal mortality rate of 619.1 per 100,000 live births in 1933 (Hoyert, 2007) Induction of labor rate of 9.5% in 1990 (Martin et al., 2006) Cesarean section rate of 20.7% in 1996 (Martin et al., 2006) Low probability of infants surviving who were born at or before 28 weeks of gestationFamily-Centered Maternity Nursing: Focus on both the physiological and psychosocial changes and needs of the childbearing family Primarily hospital birthsWomen labor, deliver, and recover in the same roomBirthing rooms \"warm and homelike\"Expectant fathers and family/friends involved in the labor and birth experience Expectant fathers or family members in the operating room during cesarean births Labor pain management: analgesics and epidurals.Hospital postpartum stay of 48 hoursInfant mortality rate of 6.1 per 1,000 live births in 2011 (CIA, 2011)Maternal mortality rate of 24 per 100,000 live births in 2008 (WHO, 2010) Induction of labor rate of 23.2% in 2009 (Martin et al., 2011)Cesarean section rate of 32.8% in 2010 (Hamilton et al., 2011)Increased survival rates of infants born between 24 weeks and 28 weeks of gestation TABLE 1-2 BIRTH RATES AND FERTILITY RATES 1910-2010 (RATES PER 1,000 LIVE BIRTHS) YEAR 1910 1930 1950 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 BIRTHRATE 30.1 21.3 24.1 18.4 15.9 16.7 14.4 13 FERTILITY RATE 126.8 89.2 106.2 87.9 68.4 70.9 2007, 2009, 2011)3704_Ch01_001-012 03/10/13 2:47 PM Page 2CHAPTER 1 Trends and Issues 3 Despite widespread advances in perinatal care, the preterm birthrate continues to rise. The number of prema-ture births rose from 10.61% of live births in 1990 to11.99% in 2010, reflecting a 13% increase (Hamilton et al.,2011) (Table 1-4). The 2010 percentages of premature births based on race of mother are:American Indian or Alaska Native: 13.6 Asian or Pacific Islander: 10.69 Hispanic: 11.79 Non-Hispanic black: 17.15 Non-Hispanic white: 10.78 (Hamilton et al., 2011).These percentages of preterm birth by race substantially contribute to disparities in health outcomes for infant.Disparities will be discussed later in this chapter. The increase in preterm birthrate is alarming in that it has an impact on:The emotional well-being of parents The length and quality of life for the preterm infant:A shorter gestational period increases the risk of complica-tions related to immature body organs and systems that canhave lifelong negative effects. 68.6% of all infant deaths occur in preterm infants(MacDorman & Mathews, 2008). The increased cost related to health care of preterminfants.The increase in preterm birthrate may have a relationship to the increase of birthrates in women 35 years and older. Aswomen age, they are at greater risk for complications duringpregnancy such as gestational diabetes and hypertensive dis-orders. These complications can have an impact on thelength of the pregnancy and the overall well-being of thedeveloping fetus. Neonatal Birth Weight Rates Neonatal birth weight rates are reported by the CDC in threemajor categories of low, normal, and high. Normal birthweight is between 2,500 and 3,999 grams; high birth weight is4,000 grams or greater; low birth weight is below 2,500 grams.Low birth weight is divided into two categories:Low birth weight (LBW) is defined as birth weight that is less than 2,500 grams but greater than 1,500 grams. Very low birth weight (VLBW) is defined as a birth weight that is less than 1,500 grams.The National Vital Statistics Reports for 2010 birth data states that:The percentage of LBW neonates has increased from 7.0in 1990 to 8.15 in 2010. The percentage of VLBW neonates has increased from1.27 in 1990 to 1.45 in 2010 (Hamilton et al., 2011).The weight of neonates at birth is an important predictor of future morbidity and mortality rates (Martin et al., 2011).Neonates with birth weights between 4,000 and 4,999 gramshave the lowest mortality rate during the first year of life. VLBW neonates are 100 times more likely to die duringthe first year of life than are neonates with birth weightsgreater than 2,500 grams. VLBW neonates account for 1.45% of all births butaccount for 54% of all infant deaths (Martin et al., 2011). Infant Mortality Rates Infant mortality is defined as a death before the first birthday.

This decrease is related to:Improvement and advances in the knowledge and care ofhigh-risk neonatesAdvances in medical technology such as extracorporealmembrane oxygenation therapy (ECMO) that is used forrespiratory distress in preterm infants (see Chapter 17) Advances in medical treatments such as exogenous pulmonary surfactant (see Chapter 17) Although this is a significant decrease, the infant mortality rate remains too high for a nation with the amount of avail-able wealth and health care resources.The 10 major causes of infant deaths are listed in Table 1-6.Between 1995 and 2010, there was a significant decreasein infant deaths related to sudden infant death syndrome(SIDS) and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) of newborns. The decrease in SIDS can be attributed to instructing parents to place their inf ants on their backs to sleep versus on their stomachs. The decrease in deaths related to RDS reflects advances in medical and nur sing car e of preterm infants. The CDC, and the Health Resources and ServiceAdministration in Healthy People 2020, have set a goal todecrease infant mortality rate to 6.0 per 1,000 live birthsby 2020.The death is related to the pregnancy or aggravated bypregnancy or management of the pregnancy. It excludesdeath from accidents or injuries. Direct obstetric death is a death resulting from complica- tions during pregnancy, labor/birth, and/or postpartum,and from interventions, omission of interventions, orincorrect treatment. Indirect obstetric death is defined as a death that is due to a preexisting disease or a disease that developsduring pregnancy that does not have a direct obstetricalcause, but its likelihood is aggravated by the changes ofpregnancy. Late maternal death is defined as a death that occursmore than 42 days after termination of pregnancy from adirect or indirect obstetrical cause. Pregnancy-related cause is defined as maternal death during pregnancy or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy regardless of cause of death (Hoyert, 2007).Maternal mortality rates have significantly decreased from 607.9 per 100,000 live births in 1915 to 7.1 in 1998 (Hoyert,2007). In 1999, there was a change in the InternationalClassification of Diseases (ICD) that added late maternaldeath and pregnancy-related causes to the ICD-10. Since theaddition of these two classifications, the reported maternalmortality rate has increased from 9.9 per 100,000 in 1999 to24.0 per 100,000 in 2009 (Table 1-7).Worldwide there were an estimated 287,000 maternaldeaths in 2010.99% of these deaths occur in developing countries. Three-fifths of the deaths occur in the sub-Saharan Africaregion. 47% decrease in maternal deaths from 1990 to 2010. This decrease of maternal deaths in developing coun-tries is attributed to incr eased female education, increased use of contraception, improved antenatalcare, and increased number of births attended byskilled health personnel (WHO, 2012). Primary causes of maternal deaths worldwide are:Severe hemorrhage Infections Eclampsia Obstructed labor Complications of abortions Other causes, such as anemia, HIV/AIDS, and cardiovas-cular disease (WHO, 2007) TABLE 1-5 INFANT MORTALITY RATES (RATES PER 1,000 LIVE BIRTHS) 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2005 2011 RATE 47.0 29.2 26.0 20.0 12.6 9.2 6.9 6.9 6.1 CIA (2011) and Murphy et al. (2012)CRITICAL COMPONENT Infant Mortality The infant mortality rate is highest for: Mothers 16 years and younger related to socioeconomic status and being biologically immature. Mothers older than 44 years of age related to an increasedrisk of complications due to age, such as gestational dia-betes and hypertensive disorders. Maternal Death and Mortality Rates The Department of Health and Human Services classifiesmaternal deaths as follows:Maternal death is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the death of a woman duringpregnancy or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy.3704_Ch01_001-012 03/10/13 2:47 PM Page 4CHAPTER 1 mosomal abnormalities Disorders related to short gestation and low birth weight Sudden infant death syndromeNewborn affected by maternal com- plications of pregnancy AccidentsNewborns affected by complications of placenta, cord, and membranes Bacteria sepsis of the newbornDisease of the circulatory systemRespiratory distress of newbornsNecrotizing enterocolotitsTABLE 1-6 LEADING CAUSES OF INFANT DEATHS AND MORTALITY RATES (RATES PER 100,000 LIVE BIRTHS) CAUSE OF DEATH 1995 RATE CAUSE OF DEATH 2010 RATE Congenital malformations and chromosomal abnormalities Disorders related to short gestation and low birth weight Sudden infant death syndromeRespiratory distress of newborns Newborns affected by maternal complications of pregnancy Newborns affected by complications of placenta, cord, and membranes Infections specific to the perinatal period Accidents Pneumonia and influenzaIntrauterine hypoxia and birth asphyxia Anderson et al. (1997) and Murphy et al. (2012) ISSUES Primary issues affecting the health of mothers and infants arebirthrates for teenagers, tobacco use during pregnancy, sub-stance abuse during pregnancy, obesity, and health disparities. Birthrate for Teenagers The birthrate for women age 10-19 in the United States:Has decreased by 43% from 1990 to 2010 (Hamilton et al., 2011).The greatest percentage of decrease occurred in ages 10-14 (Table 1-8). Is higher than in other developed countries, withbirthrate of 34.3 compared to Switzerland's rate of 3.9 (Table 1-9).The U.S. birthrates for women 15-19 years of age by (Hamilton et al., 2011).Teen births not only affect teen mothers but also have a long-term effect on their children and present a variety ofissues for both the teen parents and society.Poverty and income disparities75% of teen mothers begin receiving welfare within 5 years of the birth of their first child (The NationalCampaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, 2012).TABLE 1-7 MATERNAL MORTALITY RATIOS 1990 TO 2009 (NUMBER OFMATERNAL DEATHS PER 100,000 LIVE BIRTHS) DATE 1990 1995 2000 2005 2009 RATE 12 11 14 24 24 WHO (2010) and Martin et al.

Health issues for teen mothersTeen mothers are at higher risk for sexually transmittedillnesses and HIV. Chlamydia - increased risk of newborn eye infectionand pneumonia Syphilis - neonatal blindness and increased risk ofmaternal and neonat al death Teen mothers are at higher risk for hypertensive problemsduring pregnancy. Health issues of infants born to teen mothersInfants born to teen mothers are at greater risk for healthproblems that include prematurity and/or low birthweight. Prematurity and/or low birth weight places the infant athigher risk for infant death, respiratory distress syndrome,intraventricular bleeding, vision problems, and intestinalproblems. Infant mortality rate is higher: 16.4 for infants ofwomen under 15 years of age compar ed to 6.8 for infants of women of all ages (National Campaign toPrevent Teen Pregnancy, 2012).Educational issuesOnly 40% of teen mothers graduate from high school (TheNational Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, 2007). Children of teen mothers are at higher risk for not completinghigh school and they have lower scores on standardized tests. Teen fathersTeenage males without an involved father are at a higherrisk for dropping out of school, abusing alcohol and/ordrugs, and being incarcerated (The National Campaign toPrevent Teen Pregnancy, 2007). Unmarried teen fathers pay less than $800 a year in childsupport (The National Campaign to Prevent TeenPregnancy, 2007). Tobacco Use During Pregnancy Tobacco use during pregnancy is associated with an increasedrisk of LBW, intrauterine growth restriction, miscarriage,abruptio placenta, premature birth, SIDS, and respiratoryproblems in the newborn.Cigarette smoking during pregnancy declined from19.5% in 1989 to 13% in 2008 (Tong et al., 2009). Women who smoke during pregnancy are less likely tobreastfeed their infants. 45% of women who smoked prior to pregnancy quit dur-ing pregnancy (Tong et al., 2009). 17% of women ages 18-24 and 19.8% of women ages25-44 smoke cigarettes (MMWR, 2011). Based on race, the highest percentage of female smokersare American Indian and Alaskan Native (Table 1-10). Based on educational level, the highest percentage offemale smokers are women with a GED (MMWR,2011). Substance Abuse During Pregnancy The use of alcohol and illicit drugs during pregnancy can havea profound effect on the developing fetus and the health ofthe neonate.Exposure to alcohol during pregnancy places the develop-ing fetus at higher risk for fetal death, low birth weight,TABLE 1-9 2010 INTERNATIONAL FERTILITY RATE (BIRTHRATE PER 1,000 WOMEN AGES 15-19) NATION RATE NATION RATE Switzerland 3.9 Turkey 30.5 Italy 4.0 Egypt 40.6 Denmark 5.1 Botswana 43.8 France 6.0 Philippines 46.5 Japan 6.0 South Africa 50.4 Iceland 11.6 Argentina 54.2 Canada 11.3 Costa Rica 61.9 Australia 12.5 Mexico 65.5 Saudi Arabia 22.1 India 74.7 Russian 23.2 Brazil 76.0 Federation Unites States 27.4 Iraq 85.9 of America United Kingdom 29.7 Democratic Republic 170.6 of the Congo United Nations Statistics Division (2011)CRITICAL COMPONENT Teen Pregnancies The average related cost for teen pregnancies to federal, state,and/or local government has increased from $9.1 billion in2004 to $10.9 billion in 2008. The majority of the cost is related to consequences to thechildren of teen women, such as: Increased health issues Reduced educational achievement Increased interactions with child welfare and criminal jus-tice system.

Exposure to illicit drugs during pregnancy is associated with incidences of preterm birth, abruptio placenta, drugwithdrawal for the neonate, and a variety of congenitaldefects. Obesity Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) greater thanor equal to 30. In the United States, 35.7% of adults and16.9% of children are obese (Ogden et al., 2012).31.9% of women 20-39 years are obese. 17.1% of girls 12-19 years are obese (Ogden et al., 2012).Obesity in childbearing women has adverse effects on both the woman and her child. Obese pregnant women are athigher risk for:Gestational hypertension Preeclampsia Gestational diabetes Thromboembolism Cesarean birth Wound infections Shoulder dystocia related to macrosomia (birth weight of4,000 grams) Sleep apnea Anesthesia complications (Nodine et al., 2012)The fetuses and/or infants of obese pregnant women are at higher risk for:Fetal abnormalitiesSpina bifida Heart defects Anorectal atresia Hypospadias Intrauterine fetal death Birth injuries related to macrosomia Childhood obesity and diabetes (March of Dimes, 2012)Health Disparities The topic of health disparities addresses the differences inaccess, use of health care services, and health outcomes for various factors such as age, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status,and geographic groups and health status of these populations. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) evaluates the quality of health care based on six core measures:Effectiveness Patient safety Timeliness Patient centeredness Efficiency Access to care (AHRQ, 2011)In the AHRQ 2010 National Healthcare Disparities Report, it was reported that:Based on race, Hispanics experienced the worst health care Based on income, poor experienced the worst health care(AHRQ, 2011)TABLE 1-10 PERCENTAGES OF WOMEN WHO ARE CIGARETTE SMOKERS RACE PERCENTAGE American Indian and Alaskan Native 36.0 Non-Hispanic white 19.6 Non-Hispanic black 17.1 Hispanic 9 Asian or Pacific Islander 4.3 MMWR, 2011 CRITICAL COMPONENT Prenatal Care Low-income women are less likely to seek early and continuousprenatal care. These health care behaviors place both thewoman and her unborn child at higher risk for complicationsduring pregnancy, labor, and birth, and postpartum. The percentages of women who begin prenatal care latein the pregnancy or receive no prenatal care based on raceare listed in Table 1-11. Women under 15 years of age are the highest percentageof women of all ages who begin prenatal care late orreceive no prenatal care (Martin et al., 2006). Disparities exist in birth outcomes as measured by percentages of premature births and low birth weight(Table 1-12). Disparities exist in infant mortality rates based on race(Table 1-13).These disparities can partially be attributed to barriers to access to health care for low-income families. Examples ofbarriers to access to health care are limited finances, lack oftransportation, difficulty with dominant language, and atti-tudes of the health care team. POSITION STATEMENT Access to Health Care\"AWHONN (Association of Women Health, Obstetric andNeonat al Nur ses) considers access to affordable and acceptable health care services as a basic human right. Therefore, AWHONNstrongly supports policy initiatives that guarantee access to suchhealth care services for all people\" (AWHOON, 2008).3704_Ch01_001-012 03/10/13 2:47 PM Page 7UNIT 1 Maternity Nursing Overview 8 TABLE 1-11 PERCENTAGES OF WOMEN RECEIVING LATE OR NO PRENATAL CARE BY RACE AND HISPANIC ORIGIN, 2006 AMERICAN INDIAN ASIAN OR OR ALASKA NATIVE PACIFIC ISLANDER HISPANIC NON-HISPANIC BLACK NON-HISPANIC WHITE 8.1 3.1 5.0 5.7 2.3 Child Trends (2010a) TABLE 1-12 2004 REPORTED PERCENTAGES OF PRETERM BIRTH AND LOW BIRTH WEIGHT BY RACE PRETERM (BORN PRIOR VERY LOW BIRTH WEIGHT LOW BIRTH WEIGHT TO 37 WEEKS) (>1,500 GRAMS) (>2,500 GRAMS) ALL 12.2 1.5 8.5 AMERICAN INDIAN/ 13.5 1.3 7.3 ALASKA NATIVE ASIAN/PACIFIC ISLANDER 10.8 1.1 8.3 HISPANIC 12.0 1.2 6.9 NON-HISPANIC BLACK 17.2 3.0 13.3 NON-HISPANIC WHITE 11.2 1.5 7.1 Martin et al.

With that excitement come issues related to ethicalchallenges, high rates of litigation in obstetrics, and the challengeof practicing safe and evidence-based nursing care that is respon-sive to the needs of women and families. This chapter presentsthe foundational principles set forth by the American NursesAssociation (ANA) Code of Ethics and specialty practice stan-dards from the Association for Women's Health, Obstetric andNeonatal Nurses (AWHONN) that outline duties and obliga-tions of obstetric and neonatal nurses. Ethical principles arereviewed within the context of perinatal dilemmas and ethicaldecision making. Common issues in litigation in maternity nurs-ing are presented. Evidence-based practice and challenges inresearch utilization in the perinatal setting are explored. ETHICS IN NURSING PRACTICE The study of ethics is based in philosophical discussions ofancient Greek scholars about the nature of good and evil orright and wrong. Ethics is an integral part of nursing practiceand represents the ideal of social order. The ethical traditionof nursing is self-reflective, enduring, and distinctive. Nurses'moral and ethical responsibility to do the right thing is dis-cussed in the ANA Code of Ethics for Nurses (2001). ANA Code of Ethics The ANA Code of Ethics makes explicit the primary goals,values, and obligations of the profession of nursing (ANA,2001). The code of ethics for nursing serves as:A statement of the ethical obligations and duties of everynurseThe profession's non-negotiable ethical standard An expression of nursing's own understanding of its com-mitment to societyThe ANA Code of Ethics for Nurses describes the most fundamental values and commitments of the nurse, bound-aries of duty and loyalty, and aspects of duties beyond individ-ual patient encounter (Table 2-1). Ethical Principles Ethical and social issues affecting the health of pregnantwomen and their fetus are increasingly complex. Some of thecomplexity arises from technological advances in reproductivetechnology, maternity care, and neonatal care (McCrink,2010). Nurses are autonomous professionals who are requiredto provide ethically competent care. Some ethical principlesrelated to patient care include (Lagana & Duderstadt, 2004):Autonomy: The right to self-determination Respect for others: Principle that all persons are equallyvalued Beneficence: Obligation to do good Nonmaleficence: Obligation to do no harm Justice: Principle of equal treatment of others or that others be treated fairly Fidelity: Faithfulness or obligation to keep promises Veracity: Obligation to tell the truth Utility: The greatest good for the individual or an action that is valued Ethical Approaches Clinical situations arise where ethical principles conflict with each other. For example, the patient's right to self-determination, autonomy, includes the right to refuse treat-ment that may be beneficial to the pregnancy outcome for the 13 EXPECTED STUDENT OUTCOMES Upon completion of this chapter, the student will be able to: /H17040Define key terms. /H17040Debate ethical issues in maternity nursing. /H17040Explain standards of practice in maternity nursing. /H17040Describe legal issues in maternity nursing. /H17040Examine concepts in evidence-based practice.3704_Ch02_013-024 16/09/13 10:04 AM Page 13UNIT 1 Maternity Nursing Overview 14 fetus. Consideration of ethical approaches can help nurses asthey encounter ethical dilemmas. There are a variety of ethicalapproaches. Two key approaches are:The Rights Approach: The focus is on the individual'sright to choose, and the rights include the right to privacy,to know the truth, and to be free from injury or harm. The Utilitarian Approach: This approach posits that eth-ical actions are those that provide the greatest balance ofgood over evil and provide for the greatest good for thegreatest number.One can see how these two approaches could result in eth- ical dilemmas when decisions are made in clinical situationswhere the individual's right to choose may be in conflict withthe greatest good for society. Ethical Dilemmas An ethical dilemma is a choice that has the potential to violate ethical principles (Lagana & Duderstadt, 2004). Innursing it is often based on the nurse's commitment to advo-cacy. Action taken in response to our ethical responsibility tointervene on behalf of those in our care is patient advocacy.Advocacy also involves accountability for nurses' responses topatients' needs (Lagana, 2000). A unique aspect of maternitynursing is that the nurse advocates for two patients, thewoman and the fetus. The maternity nurse's advocacy role ismore clearly assigned for the pregnant woman than for thefetus, yet the needs of the mother and fetus are interdependent(Lagana & Duderstadt, 2004). In order to be effective advo-cates, nurses need to recognize themselves as equal partners inthe health care team (Simmonds, 2008). Examples of ethicaldilemmas in clinical practice are presented in Box 2-1. Ethics in Neonatal Care Ethics involves determining what is good, right, and fair(Pierce, 1998). The role of nurses in the neonatal intensivecare unit (NICU) requires a dual role for nurses to protect thewell-being of vulnerable infants as well as supporting andrespecting parental decisions. According to the ANA Code ofEthics (2001), nurses have an obligation to safeguard thewell-being of patients, but they also have the obligation toavoid inflicting harm. One example of a situation in whichethical decision making conflicts can arise is in the care ofinfants with extreme prematurity. Pierce (1998) suggeststhree categories for neonates in the NICU:Infants in whom aggressive care would probably be futile,where prognosis for a meaningful life is extremely poor orhopeless Infants in whom aggressive care would probably result inclear benefit to overall well-being, where prevailingknowledge and evidence indicate excellent chances forbeneficial outcomes and meaningful interactions Infants in whom the effect of aggressive care is mostlyuncertain (Fig. 2-1).Caring for infants in the face of prognostic uncertainty can present ethical dilemmas for nurses as they balance theneeds of the infant's well-being with the parents' rights tomake decisions. Nurses must continually involve parents inongoing assessment of the infant's overall well-being. ThisThe nurse, in all professional relationships, practices with compassion and respect for the inherent dignity, worth, and uniqueness of every individual unrestricted by consideration of social or economic status, personal attributes, or nature of the health problems. The nurse's primary commitment is to the patient, whether an individual, family, group, or community.The nurse promotes, advocates for, and strives to protect the health, safety, and rights of the patient.The nurse is responsible and accountable for individual nursing practice and determines the appropriate delegation of tasks consistent with the nurse's obligation to provide optimum care. The nurse owes the same duties to self as to others, including the responsibility to preserve integrity and safety, to maintain competence, and to continue personal and professional growth. The nurse participates in establishing and maintaining health care environments and conditions of employ- ment conducive to the provision of quality health care and consistent with the values of the professionthrough individual and collective action. The nurse participates in the advancement of the profession through contributions to practice, education, administration, and knowledge development. The nurse collaborates with other health professionals and the public in promoting community, national, and international efforts to meet health needs. The profession of nursing, as represented by associations and their members, is responsible for articulating nursing values, for maintaining the integrity of the profession and its practice, and for shaping social policy.TABLE 2-1 AMERICAN NURSES ASSOCIATION CODE OF ETHICS PROVISION 1 PROVISION 2 PROVISION 3PROVISION 4 PROVISION 5 PROVISION 6 PROVISION 7 PROVISION 8 PROVISION 9 American Nurses Association.

Nurses must report data and percep-tions clearly to parents and actively listen to their concernsand understanding of current clinical reality and long-termprognosis. Team conferences with physicians, nurses, par-ents, and social workers can be crucial to developing plans ofcare. Lack of consensus about a plan of care can result in profound harm for the infants, families, the health care team, and society (Penticuff, 1998) and can include needlesssuffering of the infant, psychological distress and conflictbetween the family and providers, and inappropriate expen-diture of societal resources. Penticuff (1998) proposes thatmoral responsibility for the good and harm that comes to aninfant in the NICU is not borne exclusively by either the par-ents or the health care team. Nurses and all health careproviders are obligated to both respect parental wishes anduphold ethical standards. Legal and ethical precedent sug-gests that parents ought to be the chief decision makers(Nurse's Legal Handbook, 2004). However, parents oftenlack the expertise required to make decisions yet are ulti-mately required to care for the long-term needs of the child. Collaboration among parents and professionals is essential to work for the infant's good when making treatment deci-sions for infants in the NICU. Collaborative working rela-tionships encompass working together with mutual respectfor the accountabilities of each profession to the shared goalof quality patient outcomes (Asokar, 1998). Paternalism is a system under which an authority makes decisions for othersand should be avoided in decision making in health care. Society holds the sanctity of life in high regard, as without life other values are irrelevant (Nurse's Legal Handbook,2004). Questions emerge about the quality of life when caringfor critically ill neonates. Nurses must first be clear about theirmoral and ethical perspective to be effective as part of the col-laborative health care team. Nurses spend more time at thebedside providing care for neonates and interacting with par-ents than any other health professional. Central concepts innursing are advocacy and caring. Nurses assume a key role in ethical decision making because of their unique position in all perinatal settings. Ethical sensitivity in professional prac-tice develops in contexts of uncertainty; client suffering andvulnerability; and through relationships characterized by recep-tivity, responsiveness, and courage on the part of professionals.A little dose of practical wisdom goes a long way. Ethics and Practice: Nurses' Rights and Responsibilities AWHONN supports the protection of an individual nurse'sright to choose to participate in any reproductive health careservice or research activity. Nurses have the right under fed-eral law to refuse to assist in the performance of any healthcare procedure, in keeping with their personal moral, ethical,or religious beliefs (AWHONN, 2009). AWHONN considers access to affordable and acceptable health care services a basic human right. AWHONN advo-cates that nurses adhere to the following principles: 1.Nurses have the professional responsibility to providenonjudgmental nursing care to all patients. 2.Nurses have the professional responsibility to providehigh-quality, impartial nursing care to all patients inemergency situations, regardless of nurses' personalbeliefs. 3.Nurses have a professional obligation to inform theiremployers of any attitudes and beliefs that may interferewith essential job functions.BOX 2-1 CLINICAL EXAMPLES OF PERINATAL ETHICAL DILEMMAS Court-ordered treatment Withdrawal of life support Harvesting of fetal organs or tissue In vitro fertilization and decisions for disposal of remainingfertilized ova Allocation of resources in pregnancy care during the previableperiod Fetal surgery Treatment of genetic disorders or fetal abnormalities foundon prenatal screening Equal access to prenatal care Maternal rights versus fetal rights Extraordinary medical treatment for pregnancy complications Using organs from an anencephalic infant Genetic engineering Cloning Surrogacy Drug testing in pregnancy Sanctity of life versus quality of life for extremely prematureor severely disabled infants Substance abuse in pregnancy Borderline viability: to resuscitate or not Fetal reduction Preconception gender selection Figure 2-1 Extremely premature baby in NICU.3704_Ch02_013-024 16/09/13 10:04 AM Page 15UNIT 1 Maternity Nursing Overview 16 STANDARDS OF PRACTICE In addition to a Code of Ethics from the ANA (2001),practice standards help to guide professional nursing practice. AWHONN, the professional organization formaternity nurses, has developed practice standards.AWHONN (2009) practice standards use ANA (2004)scope and standards of practice as its foundation. The stan-dards summarize what AWHONN (2009) believes is thenursing profession's best judgment and optimal practicebased on current research and clinical practice (Table 2-2).AWHONN believes that these standards are helpful for allnurses engaged in the functions described.

The best interest of an individualpatient is always the touchstone of practice. These standards are but one source of guidance. Nursesalso must act in accordance with applicable law, institu-tional rules and procedures, and established interprofes-sional arrangements concerning the division of duties. These standards represent optimal practice. Full compli-ance may not be possible at all times with all patients inall settings. These standards serve as a guide for optimal practice.They are not designed to define standards of practice foremployment, licensure, discipline, reimbursement, orlegal or other purposes. These standards may change in response to changes inresearch and practice. The standards define the nurse's responsibility to thepatient and the roles and behaviors to which the nurse isaccountable. The definition of terms delimits the scope ofthe standards (Table 2-3).The Standards of Practice set forth in this seventh edition are intended to define the roles, functions, andcompetencies of the nurse who strives to provide high-quality services to patients. The Standards of ProfessionalPerformance delineate the various roles and behaviors forwhich the professional nurse is accountable. The standardsare enduring and should remain largely stable over timebecause they reflect the philosophical values of the profes-sion (ANA, 2004).LEGAL ISSUES IN DELIVERY OF CARE Maternity nursing is the most litigious of all the areas of nurs-ing. Contributing to this is the complexity of caring for twopatients, the mother and the fetus. There are five clinical sit-uations that account for a majority of fetal and neonatalinjuries and litigation in obstetrics (Feinstein, Torgersen, &Atterbury, 2003):Inability to recognize and/or inability to appropriatelyrespond to intrapartum fetal compromise Inability to effect a timely cesarean birth (30 minutesfrom decision to incision) when indicated by fetal ormaternal condition Inability to appropriately initiate resuscitation of adepressed neonate Inappropriate use of oxytocin or misoprostol leading to uterine hyperstimulation, uterine rupture, and fetalintolerance of labor and/or fetal death Inappropriate use of forceps/vacuum and/or preventableshoulder dystociaThe number of obstetric malpractice claims represents only about 5% of all malpractice claims, but the dollaramount for the claims represents up to 35% of the totalfinancial liability of a hospital or health care system(Simpson & Creehan, 2008). The literature indicates thatpatients who are more dissatisfied with the interpersonalinteraction with health care providers are more likely to pur-sue litigation (Lagana, 2000). It has also been suggested thatincreased use of technology may interfere with a nurse'sability to engage with women and families in a therapeuticand caring interaction.TABLE 2-2 STANDARDS FOR PROFESSIONAL NURSING PRACTICE IN THE CARE OF WOMEN AND NEWBORNS\u2014cont'd STANDARDS OF PROFESSIONAL PERFORMANCESTANDARD XII.

For that reason,this is the focus of this section and serves as an example ofhow nursing standards, guidelines, and policies should be thefoundation of safe practice. Common allegations related tofetal monitoring are:Failure to accurately assess maternal and fetal status Failure to appreciate a deteriorating fetal status Failure to treat an abnormal or indeterminate FHR Failure to reduce or discontinue oxytocin with an abnor-mal or indeterminate FHR Failure to correctly communicate maternal/fetal status tothe care provider Failure to institute the chain of command when there is aclinical disagreementNurses are accountable for safe and effective FHR assess- ment, and failure to do so contributes to claims of nursing neg-ligence (Gilbert, 2007; Mahlmeister, 2000; Pearson, 2011).AWHONN (2000) provides a position statement on fetalassessment that states:AWHONN strongly advises that nurses should completea course of study that includes physiological interpreta-tion of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) and its implications for care in labor. Each facility should develop a policy that defines when touse EFM and auscultation of FHR and that specifies frequency and documentation based on best available evidence, professional association guidelines, and expertconsensus.Timely communication and collaboration with care providers is essential to ensure Category II (indeterminate) orCategory III (abnormal) FHR patterns are managed appro-priately. Organizational resources and systems should be inplace to support timely interventions when FHR is indeter-minate or abnormal (Simpson & Knox, 2003). Uniform FHRterminology and interpretation are necessary to facilitateappropriate communication and legally defensible documen-tation (Lyndon & Ali, 2009). Interpretation of FHR data can sometimes result in con- flict. There may be agreement about ominous patterns andnormal patterns, but often care providers encounter patternsthat fall between these extremes (Freeman, 2002). Someissues of conflict in the clinical setting cannot be resolvedbetween the caregivers immediately involved, yet need to beresolved quickly. 1.The nurse must initiate the course of action when the clinical situation is a matter of maternal or fetal well-being. 2.In a case of a primary care provider not responding toan abnormal FHR or a deteriorating clinical situation,the nurse should use the chain of command to resolve the situation, advocate for the patient's safety, and seeknecessary interventions to avoid a potentially adverse outcome. 3.At the first level, notify the immediate supervisor to pro-vide assistance. Further steps are defined by the structureof the institution, and a policy outlining communicationfor the chain of command should be present (Fig. 2-2). Risk Management Risk management is a systems approach to the prevention oflitigation. It involves the identification of systems problems,analysis, and treatment of risks before a suit is brought(Gilbert, 2007). There are two key components of a successfulrisk management program:Avoiding preventable adverse outcomes to the fetus during labor requires competent care providers who useconsistent and current FHR monitoring language andwho are in practice environments with systems in placethat permit timely clinical intervention. Decreasing risk of liability exposure includes methods todemonstrate evidence that appropriate timely care wasprovided that accurately reflects maternal fetal statusbefore, during, and after interventions occurred.Not all adverse or unexpected outcomes are preventable or are the result of poor care. Authors suggest (Simpson &Creehan, 2008; Simpson & Knox, 2003) the risk of liabilitycan be reduced and injuries to mothers and neonates can bereduced when all members of the perinatal team follow twobasic tenets:Use applicable evidence and/or published standards and guidelines as the foundation of care. Make patient safety a priority over convenience, productivity, and costs.All nurses need to bear in mind that the most and some- times the only defensible nursing actions are those that have Figure 2-2 Together the nurse and physician review an EFM strip.3704_Ch02_013-024 16/09/13 10:04 AM Page 19UNIT 1 Maternity Nursing Overview 20 as their sole focus the health and well-being of the patient(Greenwald & Monder, 2003). EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE Health care professions are moving toward thinking thatpractice decisions ought to be made with the best availableknowledge or evidence. Evidence-based practice (EBP) andterms such as evidence-based medicine (EBM) and evidence-based nursing (EBN) reflect a very important global paradigmshift in how to view health care outcomes, how the disciplineis taught, how practice is conducted, and how health carepractices are evaluated for quality (Milton, 2007). In the early 1990s in the United States, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) was establishedwith interdisciplinary teams to gather and assess availableresearch literature and develop evidence-based clinical guide-lines. Nurses were prominent members of the interdisciplinaryteams who performed this early work. In the mid-1990s,AHCPR was changed to the Agency for Healthcare Researchand Quality (AHRQ), and it now has a clearinghouse for clin-ical guidelines (http://www.guidelines.gov). The National Guideline Clearinghouse is a publicly avail- able database of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines(CPGs). The database is regularly updated and is therefore animportant resource for clinicians. We recommend the NationalGuideline Clearinghouse as the first place clinicians go toassess whether an established guideline is available. For CPGto be considered by the National Guideline Clearinghouse itmust meet four rigorous criteria (AHRQ, 2000): 1.Contains systematically developed recommendations,strategies, or other information to assist health care decision making in specific clinical circumstances. 2.Produced under the auspices of a relevant professionalorganization. 3.Development process included a verifiable, systematic literature search and review of the existing literature published in peer-reviews journals. 4.Current, that is developed, reviewed, or revised withinthe last 5 years.Many health professionals have chosen to view the EBP movement as a systematic approach to determine the most cur-rent and relevant evidence upon which to base decisions aboutpatient care (Melnyk & Fineout-Overholt, 2005). Rigorouslyconducted research that reports findings that are \"good evi-dence\" may not always translate to the \"right\" decisions for anindividual patient. Most authors and clinicians have extendedthe definition of evidence-based practice (EBP) to include the integration of best research evidence, clinical expertise, and patient values in making decisions about the care of patients (Reilly, 2004). Clinical expertise comes from knowledge and experienceover time. Patient values are the unique circumstances of eachpatient and should include patient preferences. Characteristicsof best research evidence are quantitative evidence such as clin-ical trials and laboratory experiments, evidence from qualitativeresearch, and evidence from experts in practice.Although not absolute, a hierarchy of evidence can be helpful when evaluating research evidence. When consideringpotential interventions, nurses should look for the highestlevel of available evidence relevant to the clinical problem. Ahierarchy of strength of evidence for treatment decisions ispresented in Box 2-2, indicating unsystematic clinical obser-vations as the lowest level and systematic reviews of RCTs asthe highest level of evidence. Evidence-Based Nursing Evidence-based nursing (EBN) has become an internationallyrecognized although sometimes contested part of nursingpractice (Flemming, 2007). EBN is central to the knowledgebase for nursing practice. Critics of EBN dislike the centralrole that randomized controlled trials (RCTs) take in pro-viding evidence for nursing, claiming that the context andexperience of nursing care are removed from evaluation ofevidence. One of the principles of evidence-based health carehas been driven by requirements to deliver quality care withineconomically constrained conditions (Critical Component:Evidence-Based Nursing). Some nurses have adopted a predominantly medical model of evidence, with RCTs as the central, methodologicalapproach to define good evidence. EBN has been criticizedfor this stance, focusing on the lack of relevance of RCTs fornursing practice. Criticisms stem from the fact that RCTs areEvidence-Based Practice Research: CochraneReviews An important resource for evidence-based practice is systemat-ic reviews. One such source is Cochrane Reviews (http://www.cochrane.org). The Cochrane Review is an international con-sortium of experts who perform systematic reviews and meta-analysis on all available data, evaluating the body of evidenceon a particular clinical topic for quality of study design andstudy results. These reviews look at randomized clinical trials ofinterventions related to a specific clinical problem and, afterassessing the findings from rigorous studies, make recommen-dations for clinical practice. They consider the randomized con-trolled trial (RCT) as the gold standard of research evidence.Quality and Safety Education for Nurses(QSEN) Evidence-Based Practice QSEN EBP definition: Integrate best current evidence with clinical expertise and patient/family preferences and valuesfor delivery of optimal health care. Nurses are in a unique position to explore a woman's preferences, and advocate for the use of best current evidenceand clinical expertise for delivery of optimal health care.Some suggestions to foster EBP in clinical settings include: Describe and be able to locate reliable sources for locat- ing evidence reports and clinical practice guidelines Question rationale for routine approaches to care that result in less-than-desired outcomes or adverse events Base individualized care plan on patient values, clinical expertise, and evidenceQSEN3704_Ch02_013-024 16/09/13 10:04 AM Page 20CHAPTER 2 Ethics and Standards of Practice Issues 21 given an illusionary stance of credibility, when there may notbe credible evidence relevant to nursing practice. Utilization of Research in Clinical Practice To enhance EBP and support the choices of childbearingwomen and families, we must utilize qualitative research find-ings in practice (Durham, 2002). Although nursing has devel-oped models for assisting a practitioner in applying researchfindings in practice (Cronenwett, 1995; Stetler, 1994; Titler& Goode, 1995), these models only assist in applying quanti-tative research. Qualitative research is increasingly recognized as an integral part of the evidence that imforms evidence-based practice.Qualitative researchers investigate naturally occurring phenom-ena and describe, analyze, and sometimes develop a theory onthe phenomena. They also describe the context and relation-ships of key factors related to the phenomena. This kind of workis conducted in the \"real world,\" not in a controlled situation,and yields important findings for practice. Practitioners may notbe aware of qualitative research findings, or, if they are, they maynot be able to apply the findings. Reports of qualitative researchshould be more readily understood by persons in practice as theyare conveyed in language that is more understandable to thepractitioner. Story lines from qualitative research are often amore compelling and culturally resonant way to communicateresearch findings, particularly to staff, affected groups, and pol-icy makers (Sandelowski, 1996). Despite the fact that qualitativeresearch is conducted in the \"real world\" and is more under-standable to many practitioners, as with quantitative researchutilization, a gap sometimes exists between the world of quali-tative research and the world of practice. A creative bridgebetween these worlds is needed. Some guidelines for bridgingthat gap are outlined by Swanson, Durham, and Albright(1997) and include evaluating the findings or proposed theoryfor its context, generalizability, and fit with one's own practice;evaluating the concepts, conditions, and variation explained inthe findings; and evaluating findings for enhancing and informingone's practice. In the current era of cost containment, nurses must know what is going on in the real world of their patients becausepractitioners are limited to interacting with clients within anever-smaller window of time and space. Qualitative researchcan assist in bringing practitioners an awareness of that largerworld and its implications for their scope of practice (Swanson,Durham, & Albright, 1997). Qualitative research describes andanalyzes our patients' realities. The research findings have thecapacity to influence conceptual thinking and cause practition-ers to question assumptions about a phenomenon in practice(Cronenwett, 1995). Incorporating qualitative research as evi-dence to support research-based practice has the capacity notonly to enhance nursing practice but also to resolve some of thetensions between art and science with which nurses sometimesfind themselves struggling (Durham, 2002). Research Utilization Challenges Health care often falls short in translating research into prac-tice and improvement of care. While adopting EBP hasresulted in improvements in patient outcome, large gapsremain between what we know and what we do (Scott, 2010).Failing to use the latest health care research is costly, harmful,and can lead to use of ineffective care. Many innovations have become common practice in peri- natal nursing:Fetal monitoring Mother/baby care Early postpartum dischargeThese changes in care were influenced by: Medical and technological innovations Social context of the time and families' preferences Health care costsHow nurses respond to the increasing use of technology during birth, threats of litigation, and providing the best careunder time and cost constraints are the realities facing currentperinatal nursing care today (Martell, 2006; Lothian, 2009). Continuous electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) in labor is one of the most common interventions during labor. However,CRITICAL COMPONENT Evidence-Based Nursing To practice EBN, a nurse is expected to combine the bestresearch evidence with clinical expertise while taking intoaccount the patients' preferences and their situation in the con-text of the available resources. Evidence-based decision makingshould include consideration of the patients' clinical state, clin-ical setting, and clinical circumstances (DiCenso, Ciliska, &Guyatt, 2005).

The reviewers concluded that use of routineEFM has no measurable impact on infant morbidity and mor-tality. In the latest review the authors concluded continuousEFM during labor is associated with a reduction in neonatalseizures but no significant differences in cerebral palsy, infantmortality, or other standard measures of neonatal well-being.However, continuous EFM was associated with an increase incaesarean births and operative vaginal births. They noted thereal challenge is how best to convey this uncertainty to womento enable them to make an informed choice without compro-mising the normality of labor. Although EBP is the goal of nursing care and has become the standard of care in the United States, the evidence aboutEFM has not been used in practice (Wood, 2003). Researchevidence does not support the use of continuous EFM.Despite this, many reasons contribute to its continued use,such as habit, convenience, liability, staffing, and economics(Woods, 2003). It is no longer acceptable for nurses to con-tinue doing things the way they have always been done, bytradition without questioning whether or not it is the bestapproach. One way nurses can ensure EBP in their setting isby participating in multidisciplinary teams that generateresearch-based practice guidelines.

They are the basic functional and physical units of heredity. There are approximately 30,000 genes in the human genome.The genome is an organism's complete set of DNA. Numerous genes are located on each human chromosome.Each human cell contains 46 chromosomes. There are 22 homologous pairs of chromosomes and onepair of sex chromosomes (XX or XY). Genotype refers to a person's genetic makeup. Phenotype refers to how the genes are outwardly expressed (i.e., eye color, hair color, height). Dominant and Recessive Inheritance Genes are either dominant or recessive. When there isboth a dominant and a recessive gene in the pair, thetraits of the dominant gene are present. The traits of the recessive gene are present when bothgenes of the pair are recessive.CRITICAL COMPONENT Genetics and Genomics \"The main difference between genomics and genetics is thatgenetics scrutinizes the functioning and composition of thesingle gene whereas genomics addresses all genes and theirinterrelationships in order to identify their combined influenceon the growth and development of the organism.\" WHO, 2012 Don't have time to read this chapter?

A person who has only one recessive gene for a disorder isknown as a carrier and does not present with the disorder. Genetic disorders related to a dominant gene are rare. Sex-Linked Inheritance Also referred to as X-linked inheritance or traits (seeTable 3-1) These are genes or traits that are located only on the X chromosome. These genes can be either recessive ordominant. The Y chromosome does not have the corre-sponding genes for some of the X chromosome's genes. A male child who receives an X chromosome with a disor-der of one or more of its genes presents with the disorderwhen the Y chromosome does not carry that gene; thegene, even though it may be recessive, becomes dominant. Female children who have one X chromosome with asex-linked trait disorder do not present with the trait, butare carriers of the trait. Relevance of Genetics in the Care of the Childbearing Family The scientific knowledge of genetics is rapidly increasingwith the desire that gene therapy will be used to correctgenetic disorders such as heart disease, diabetes, andDown syndrome.The Human Genome Project, a 13-year international,collaborative research program that was completed in2003, has provided the scientific community with valuable information that is being used in the diagno-sis, treatment, and prevention of genetically linked disorders. 10% of all abnormalities of the developing human are dueto genetic factors (Sadler, 2004). Genetic Testing There are several genetic tests that are selectively used inthe care of the childbearing families. These include:Carrier testing Used to identify individuals who carry one copy of agene mutation that, when pr esent in two copies, causes a genetic disorder. Used when there is a family history of a genetic disorder . When both prospective parents are tested, the test canprovide information about their risk of having a childwith a genetic condition. Preimplantation testing, also known as preimplantationgenetic diagnosis (PGD) Used to detect genetic changes in embryos that are creat ed using assisted reproductive techniques. Prenatal testing Allows for the early detection of genetic disorders, suchas trisomy 21, hemophilia, and T ay-Sachs disease. Newborn screening Used to detect genetic disorders that can be treatedearly in life. TABLE 3-1 GENETIC DISEASES DISEASE (PATTERN OF INHERITANCE) DESCRIPTIONSICKLE-CELL ANEMIA (R) CYSTIC FIBROSIS (R) TAY-SACHS DISEASE recessive; D = dominant.Scanlon & Sanders (2007).The most common genetic disease among people of African ancestry.

Degeneration of neurons and the nervous system results in death by the age of 2 years. Lack of an enzyme to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine leads to severe men- tal and physical retardation. These effects may be prevented by the use of a diet(beginning at birth) that limits phenylalanine. Uncontrollable muscle contractions between the ages of 30 and 50 years, followed by loss of memory and personality. There is no treatment that can delay mental deterioration. Lack of factor VIII impairs chemical clotting; may be controlled with factor VIII from donated blood. Replacement of muscle by adipose or scar tissue, with progressive loss of muscle function; often fatal before age 20 years due to involvement of cardiac muscle.3704_Ch03_025-044 03/10/13 2:48 PM Page 26CHAPTER 3 Genetics, Conception, Fetal Development, and Reproductive Technology 27 Couples who have a higher risk for conceiving a childwith a genetic disorder include:Maternal age older than 35 History of previous pregnancy resulting in a genetic disorder or newborn abnormalities Man and/or woman who has a genetic disorder Family history of a genetic disorder Diagnosis of genetic disorders during pregnancy providesparents with options to:Continue or terminate the pregnancy Prepare for a child with this genetic disorder Use gene therapy when available Nursing ActionsNursing actions for couples who elect to terminate thepregnancy based on information from genetic testing are: Explain the stages of grief they will experience. Inform the couple that grief is a normal process. Encourage the couple to communicate with each otherand shar e their emotions. Ref er the couple to a support group if available in their community . Nursing actions for couples who elect to continue thepregnancy based on information from genetic testing are: Provide them additional information about the geneticdisorder. Ref er them to support groups for parents who have childr en with the same genetic disorder . Provide a list of Web sites that contain accurate information about the disorder . Explain that they will experience grief over the loss ofthe \"dr eam child\" and this is normal. Encour age them to talk openly to each other about their f eelings and concerns. A general understanding of genetics and the possible effectson the developing human are necessary for nurses, especiallythose practicing in the obstetrical or pediatric areas. Nursesmay need to: Explain/clarify diagnostic procedures used in genetic testing (i.e., purpose, f indings, and possible side effects). Clarify or reinforce information the couple received from theirhealth car e pro vider or genetic counselor. Maternal-child nurses need to have knowledge and infor-mation regarding: Genetic counseling services available in the parents' community Access to genetic services Procedure for referral to the different services The information or services these agencies provide TERATOGENS Teratogens are defined as any drugs, viruses, infections, or other exposures that can cause embryonic/fetal devel-opmental abnormality (Table 3-2). Birth defects can occur from genetic disorders or be theresult of teratogen exposure. The degree or types of malformation vary based onlength of exposure, amount of exposure, and when itoccurs during human development.TABLE 3-2 TERATOGENIC AGENTS AGENT EFFECT DRUGS CHEMICALS syndrome occurring when thepregnant woman ingests sixor more alcoholic drinks aday. No amount of alcohol isconsidered safe during preg-nancy. Newborn characteris-tics of fetal alcohol syndromeinclude: \u0081Low birth thatcan lead to renal f ailure and f etal or neonatal death \u0081Intrauterine growth restriction Increased risk f o r: \u0081Neural tubal defects \u0081Craniofacial defects, includingcleft lip and palat \u0081Intrauterine growth restriction Increased risk f o r: \u0081Heart, limbs, face, gastroin-testinal tr act, and genitouri- nar y tract defects \u0081Cerebral infarctions \u0081Placental abnormalities Increased risk f o \u0081Fetal demise \u0081Fetal or newborn hemorrhage \u0081Central \u0081Microcephaly \u0081Cerebral calcification hands and feet \u0081Blindness/cataracts and/or blindness \u0081Mental retardation \u0081Fetal demise Increased risk f o r: \u0081Skin, bone and/or teeth defects \u0081Fetal demise Increased risk shown in a midsagittal section throughthe pelvic cavity.The developing human is most vulnerable to the effectsof teratogens during organogenesis, which occurs duringthe first 8 weeks of gestation. Exposure during this timecan cause gross structural defects (American College ofObstetricians and Gynecologists [ACOG], 1997). Exposure to teratogens after 13 weeks of gestation maycause fetal growth restriction or reduction of organ size(ACOG, 1997).CRITICAL COMPONENT Teratogens The developing human is most vulnerable to the effects of teratogens during the period of organogenesis, the first 8 weeksof gestation. CRITICAL COMPONENT Toxoplasmosis Can cause fetal demise, mental retardation, and blindnesswhen the embryo is exposed to Toxoplasma during pregnancy (see Table 3-2). Toxoplasma is a protozoan parasite found in cat feces and uncooked or rare beef and lamb. Pregnant women or women who are attempting pregnancyneed to avoid contact with cat feces (i.e., changing a litter box). Pregnant women or women who are attempting pregnancyshould avoid eating rare beef or lamb. ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY REVIEW Female The major structures and functions of the female reproductivesystem are (Figs. 3-1 and 3-2): OvariesThere are two oval shaped ovaries; one on each side of uterus. The ovarian ligament and broad ligament help keep theovaries in place.3704_Ch03_025-044 03/10/13 2:48 PM Page 28CHAPTER 3 Genetics, Conception, Fetal Development, and Reproductive Technology 29 Primary follicles are present in the ovaries. Several thousand follicles are present at birth. Each follicle contains an oocyte. The follicle cells follicle. Fallopian tubesThere are two fallopian tubes (also referred to as oviducts). The lateral end partially surrounds the ovary. Fimbriae (fringelike projections) from the lateral endcreat e a current within the fluid to pull the ovum into the fallopian tube (Scanlon & Sanders, 2007). Peristaltic waves created by the smooth muscle contr actions of the f allopian tubes move the ovum through the tube and into the uterus (Scanlon &Sanders, 2007). The medial end opens into the uterus. Fertilization occurs within the fallopian tube. UterusIt is shaped like an upside-down pear. It is approximately 3 inches long; 2 inches wide; 1 inch deep. The fundus is the upper portion of the uterus. The body of the uterus is the large central portion. The cervix of the uterus is the narrow, lower end thatopens to the vagina. The inner lining of the uterus is the endometrium. The endometrium consists of the basilar layer (a perma-nent layer) and the functional layer (a regener ative layer). Estrogen and progesterone stimulate the functionallayer of the endometrium to thicken in pr epar ation for implantation. The endometrium continues to thicken when implanta-tion occur s. The functional layer is lost during the menstrual cyclewhen implant ation does not occur .Implantation normally occurs in the uterus. The uterus expands during pregnancy to accommodate thedeveloping embryo/fetus and placenta. VaginaA muscular tube approximately 4 inches in length thatextends from the cervix to the perineum. Functions Receive sperm during sexual intercourse Provide exit for menstrual blood flow Birth canal during second stage of labor External genital structure, also known as the vulvaClitoris A small mass of erectile tissue anterior to the urethral orifice Responds to sexual stimulation. Labia majora and minora Paired folds of skin that cover the openings to the urethr a and vagina and prevent drying of their mucous membranes. Bartholin's glands They are located in the floor of the vestibule. The ducts of the gland open onto the mucus of thevaginal orif ice. Their etions keep lubricate the vagina during se xual intercour se. Male The major structures and functions of the male reproductivesystem are (Figs. 3-3 and 3-4): ScrotumA loose bag of skin and connective tissue which holds thetestes suspended within it. Temperature inside the scrotum is approximately 96 \u00b0F, which is lower than the body temperature and necessary forthe production of viable sperm (Scanlon & Sanders, Bartholin's gland Figure 3-2 Female reproductive system shown in anterior view.

TestesA pair of testis lies suspended in the scrotum. Testes develop in the fetus near the kidney and normallydescend into the scrotum prior to birth. Each testis is divided into lobes which contain several sem-iniferous takes place the stimulat ed by t decreases the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH); decr eased le vels of FSH causes a decrease testosterone levels. Sperm travel from the seminiferous tubules though thetestis (a tubular network) and enter the epididymis. EpididymisA coiled tube-like structure on the posterior surface of eachtestis Sperm complete their maturation within the epididymis.3704_Ch03_025-044 03/10/13 2:48 PM Page 30CHAPTER 3 Genetics, Conception, Fetal Development, and Reproductive Technology 31 Ductus deferens, also referred to as vas deferensIt extends from the epididymis into the abdominal cavity.In the abdominal cavity, it extends over the urinary blad-der and down the posterior side of the bladder joinswith the ejaculatory duct. Ejaculatory ductsThere are two ejaculatory receive from the ductus deferens and secretionsfrom the seminal vesicles. They empty into the urethra. Seminal vesiclesThey are located posterior to the urinary bladder. They produce secretions that contain fructose, which is anenergy source for sperm. The secretions are alkaline, which enhances sperm motility. Prostate glandIt is a muscular gland located below the urinary bladder. It surrounds the first inch of the urethra as the urethraextends from the bladder. It secretes an alkaline fluid that enhances sperm mobility. Bulbourethral glands, also referred to as Cowper's glandsThey are located below the prostate gland. They secrete an alkaline solution that coats the interiorof the urethra to neutralize the acidic urine that is present.UrethraIt is located within the penis. It is the final duct that the semen passes through as it exitsthe body. PenisIt is the external male genital organ. It consists of smooth muscle, connective tissue, and blood sinuses. The penis is flaccid when blood flow to the area is minimal. The penis is erect when the arteries of the penis dilate andthe sinuses fill with blood. MENSTRUAL CYCLE A woman's menstrual cycle is influenced by the ovarian cycleand endometrial cycle (Fig. 3-5). Ovarian Cycle The ovarian cycle pertains to the maturation of ova and con- sists of three phases:The follicular phase begins the first day of menstruation and last 12-14 days. During this phase, the graafian follicleis maturing under the influence of two pituitary hormones:luteinizing and follicleCorpus luteumCorpus albicansOvulation 0 5 20 25 28 DaysMenstr ual flow Figure 3-5 The menstrual cycle. The levels of the major hormones are shown in relation-ship to one another throughout the cycle.Changes in the ovarian follicle are depicted.The relative thickness 2:48 PM Page 31UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 32 The ovulatory phase begins when estrogen levels peak and ends with the release of the oocyte (egg) from themature graafian follicle. The release of the oocyte isreferred to as ovulation.There is a surge in LH levels 12-36 hours before ovulation. There is a decrease in estrogen levels and an increase inprogesterone levels before the LH surge. The luteal phase begins after ovulation and lasts approxi- mately 14 days. During this phase, the cells of the emptyfollicle undergo changes and form into the corpus luteum.The corpus luteum produces high levels of progesteronealong with low levels of estrogen. If pregnancy occurs, the corpus luteum continues to releaseprogesterone and estrogen until the placenta matures andassumes this function. If pregnancy does not occur, the corpus luteum degeneratesand results in a decrease in progesterone and the beginningof menstruation. Endometrial Cycle The endometrial cycle pertains to the changes in the endometrium of the uterus in responses to the hormonalchanges that occur during the ovarian cycle. This cycle con-sists of three phases:The proliferative phase occurs following menstruation and ends with ovulation. During this phase, theendometrium is preparing for implantation by becomingthicker and more vascular. These changes are in responseto the increasing levels of estrogen produced by thegraafian follicle. The secretory phase begins after ovulation and ends with the onset of menstruation. During this phase, theendometrium continues to thicken. The primary hor-mone during this phase is progesterone, which is secretedfrom the corpus luteum.If pregnancy occurs, the endometrium continues to developand begins to secrete glycogen. If pregnancy does not occur, the corpus luteum begins todegenerate and the endometrial tissue degenerates. The menstrual phase occurs in response to hormonal changes and results in the sloughing off of the endome-trial tissue. OOGENESIS Oogenesis is the formation of a mature ovum (egg). Oogenesis is regulated by two primary hormones.Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secreted the Estrogen secreted the follicle cells promotes the maturation of the ovum. Process of oogenesis (Fig. 3-6)FSH stimulates the growth of ovarian follicle which con-tains an oogonium (stem cell). Figure 3-6 Oogenesis.

The process of mitosis and For each primary spermatocytethat undergoes meiosis, four function-al sperm cells are formed. The struc-ture of the sperm cell is also shown. Through the process of mitosis, the oogonium within theovary forms into two daughter cells: the primary oocyteand a new stem cell. Mitosis is the process by which a cell divides and f orms two genetically identical cells (daughter cells) each con-taining the diploid number of chromosomes. Through the process of meiosis, the primary oocyte formsinto the secondary oocyte and a polar body. The polar bodyforms into two polar bodies. The secondary oocyte formsinto a polar body and a mature ovum. Meiosis is a process of two successive cell divisions that pr oduces cells that contain half the number of chromo- somes SPERMATOGENESIS Spermatogenesis is the formation mature is regulated by three maturationof the sperm. Process of spermatogenesis (Fig. 3-7):Through the process of mitosis, the spermatogonium (stem tubules a new spermatogonia and a spermatogonium. The spermatogonium differentiates and is referred to as theprimary spermatocyte. Through the process of meiosis, the primary spermatocyteforms into two secondary spermatocytes and each secondaryspermatocyte forms into two spermatids and contain thehaploid number of chromosomes. Spermatids mature and are referred to as spermatozoa. CONCEPTION Conception, also known as fertilization, occurs when a sperm nucleus enters the nucleus of the oocyte (Fig. 3-8).Fertilization normally occurs in the outer third of the fallopian tube.3704_Ch03_025-044 03/10/13 2:48 PM Page 33UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 34 The fertilized oocyte is called a zygote and contains the diploid number of chromosomes (46). Cell Division The single-cell zygote undergoes mitotic cell divisionknown as cleavage. Three days after fertilization, the zygote forms into a 16-cell, solid sphere that is called a morula. Mitosis continues, and around day 5 the developinghuman is known as the blastocyst and enters the uterus. The blastocyst is composed of an inner cell mass known as the embryoblast, which will develop into the embryo, and an outer cell mass known as the trophoblast, which will assist in implantation and become part of the placenta. Multiple gestation refers to more than one developing embryo such as twins and triplets.Twins can be either monozygotic or dizygotic. Monozygotic twins, also referred to as identical twins, arethe result of one fertilized ovum splitting during the earlystages of cell division and forming two identical embryos.These developing fetuses are genetically the same. Dizygotic twins, also referred to as fraternal twins, arethe result of two separate ova being fertilized by two separate sperm. These developing fetuses are not geneti-cally the same. Implantation Implantation, the embedding of the blastocyst into the endometrium of the uterus, begins around day 5 or 6.Progesterone stimulates the endometrium of the uterus,which becomes thicker and more vascular in preparationfor implantation. Enzymes secreted by the trophoblast, now referred to asthe chorion, digest the surface of the endometrium inpreparation for implantation of the blastocyst. Implantation normally occurs in the upper part of theposterior wall of the uterus. EMBRYO AND FETAL DEVELOPMENT Embryo The developing human is referred to as an embryo from the time of implantation through 8 weeks of gestation. Organogenesis,the formation and development of body organs, occurs duringthis critical time of human development.Primary germ layers begin to develop around day 14(Table 3-3). These germ layers, known as the ectoderm, mesoderm,and endoderm, form the different organs, tissues, andbody structure of the developing human.The ectoderm is the outer germ layer. The mesoderm is the middle germ layer. The endoderm is the inner germ layer. The heart forms during the 3rd gestational week andbegins to beat and circulate blood during the 4th gestational week. By the end of the 8th gestational week the developinghuman has transformed from the primary germ layers to Fertilization2 cell stage(36 hours) 4 cell stage(48 hours) and early embryonic development.Fertilization takes place in the fallopiantube, and the embryo has reached theblastocyst stage when it becomesimplanted in the endometrium of theuterus.3704_Ch03_025-044 03/10/13 2:48 PM Page 34CHAPTER 3 Genetics, Conception, Fetal Development, and Reproductive Technology 35 a clearly defined human that is 3 cm in length with allorgan systems formed (Fig. 3-9). Fetus The developing human is referred to as a fetus from week 9 to birth. During this stage of development, organ systems aregrowing and maturing (Table 3-4). Fetal Circulation The cardiovascular system begins to develop within thefirst few weeks of gestation. The heart begins to beat during the 4th gestational week. Unique features of fetal circulation are (Fig. 3-10):High levels of oxygenated blood enter the fetal circulatorysystem from the placenta via the umbilical vein. The ductus venosus connects the umbilical vein to the inferior vena cava. This allows the majority of the highlevels of oxygenated blood to enter the right atrium. The foramen ovale is an opening between the right and left atria. Blood high in oxygen is shunted to the leftatrium via the foramen ovale. After delivery, the fora-men ovale closes in response to increased blood returningto the left atrium. It may take up to 3 months for fullclosure.TABLE 3-3 STRUCTURES DER IVED FROM THE PRIMARY GERM LAYERS LAYER STRUCTURES DERIVED* ECTODERM MESODERM ENDODERM *These are representative lists, not all-inclusive ones.

The majority of the oxygenated bloodis shunted to the aorta via the ductus arteriosus withsmaller amounts going to the lungs. After delivery, theductus arteriosus constricts in response to the higher bloodoxygen levels prostaglandins. PLACENTA, MEMBRANES, AMNIOTIC FLUID, AND UMBILICAL CORD Placenta The placenta is formed from both fetal and maternal tissue (Fig. 3-11).The chorionic membrane that develops from the trophoblastalong with the chorionic villi form the fetal side of the pla-centa. The chorionic villi are projections from the chorionthat embed into the decidua basalis and later form the fetalblood vessels of the placenta. The endometrium is referred to beneath the blastocyst, forms the maternal portion of theplacenta. The maternal side of the placenta is divided into com-partments or lobes known as cotyledons. The placental membrane separates the maternal and fetalblood and prevents fetal blood mixing with maternalblood, but allows for the exchange of gases, nutrients,and electrolytes. Function of the Placenta Metabolic and gas exchange: In the placenta, fetalwaste products and CO 2are transferred from the fetal blood into the maternal blood sinuses by diffusion.Nutrients, such as glucose and amino acids, and O 2are transferred from the maternal blood sinuses to the fetalblood through the mechanisms of diffuse and activetransport. Hormone production: The major hormones the placentaproduces are progesterone, estrogen, human chorionicgonadotropin (hCG), and human placental lactogen(hPL), also known facilitates implantation and decreases uterinecontractility. the breasts anduterus. corpus luteum so that it will continueto secrete estrogen and progesterone until the placenta ismature enough to secrete these hormones. This is the hor-mone assessed in pregnancy tests. hCG rises rapidly duringthe first trimester and then has a rapid decline. hPL: Promotes fetal growth by regulating glucose availableto the developing human.

Drugs can cross the placental membrane. Womenshould consult with their health care provider beforetaking any medication/drugs. Drugs with an FDA pregnancy category C, D, or X should be avoided during pregnancy or when attempting pregnancy. The placenta becomes fully functional between the 8thand 10th weeks of gestation. By the 9th month, the placenta is between 15 and 25 cm indiameter, 3 cm thick, and weighs approximately 600 grams.TABLE 3-4 SUMMARY OF FETAL DEVELOPMENT\u2014cont'd GESTATIONAL WEEK LENGTH* AND WEIGHT FETAL DEVELOPMENT/CHARACTERISTICS 24 28 32 36 40 *Length is measured from the crown (top of head) to the rump (buttock).

The chorionic membrane (outer membrane) developsfrom the trophoblast. The amniotic membrane (inner membrane) developsfrom the embryoblast. The embryo and amniotic fluid are contained within theamniotic sac. The membranes stretch to accommodate the growth ofthe developing fetus and the increase of amniotic fluid. Amniotic Fluid Amniotic fluid is the fluid contained within the amnioticsac (Fig. 3-12). Amniotic fluid is clear and is mainly composed of water.It also contains proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, elec-trolytes, fetal cells, lanugo, and vernix caseosa. during the first trimester is producedfrom the amniotic membrane. During the second andthird trimesters, the fluid is produced by the fetal kidneys. Amniotic fluid increases during pregnancy and peaksaround 34 weeks at 800-1,000 mL and then decreases to500-600 mL at term.

CRITICAL COMPONENT Medications Women who are pregnant or attempting pregnancy shouldconsult with their health care provider before taking any pre-scribed or over-the-counter medications, as medications cancross the placental membrane. 03/10/13 2:48 PM Page 38CHAPTER 3 Genetics, Conception, Fetal Development, and Reproductive Technology 39 Function of Amniotic Fluid Acts as a cushion for the fetus when there are suddenmaternal movements Prevents adherence of the developing human to theamniotic membranes Allows freedom of fetal movement, which aids in symmetrical musculoskeletal development Provides a consistent thermal environment Abnormalities Polyhydramnios or hydramnios refers to excess amount of amniotic fluid (1,500-2,000 mL). Newborns of motherswho experienced polyhydramnios have an increased inci-dence of chromosomal disorders and gastrointestinal, car-diac, and/or neural tube disorders. Oligohydramnios refers to a decreased amount of amni- otic fluid (<500 mL at term or 50% reduction of normalamount), which is generally related to a decrease in placental function. Newborns of mothers who experi-enced oligohydramnios have an increased incidence of congenital renal problems. Umbilical Cord Connects the fetus to the placenta Consist of two umbilical arteries and one umbilical veinArteries carry deoxygenated blood. The vein carries oxygenated blood. The vessels are surrounded by Wharton's jelly, a collagenous substance, which protects the vessels from compression. Usually inserted in the center of the placenta. Average length of the cord is 55 cm.Causes One third of the causes are related to female factors alone,one third to male factors alone, and one third to a combina-tion of male and female factors (Frey & Patel, 2004).Male causative factors are classified into five categories:endocrine, spermatogenesis, sperm antibodies, spermtransport, and disorders of intercourse (Porche, 2006).Endocrine: Pituitary diseases, pituitary tumors, and hypo-thalamic diseases may interfere male fertility. Low levelsof luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone(FSH), or testosterone can also decrease sperm production. Spermatogenesis is the process in which mature functional sperm are formed. Several factors can affect the develop-ment of mature sperm. These factors are referred to asgonadotoxins and include: Drugs (e.g., chemotherapeutics, calcium channel block-ers, her oin, alcohol, and nicotine) Infections (e.g., prostatitis, sexually transmitted illnesses,and contr acting mumps af ter puberty) Systemic illness Heat exposure: Prolonged heat exposure to the testicles(e.g., use of hot tubs, wearing tight under wear , and fre- quent bicycle riding) Pesticides Radiation to the pelvic region Sperm antibodies are an immunological r eaction against the sperm that causes a decrease in spermmotility. This is seen mainly in men who have had eithera vasectomy reversal or experienced testicular trauma. Sperm transport factor addresses the structures related tothe male r epr oductive anatomy that might be missing or blocked, thus interfering with the transportation of sperm.These causes can include vasectomy, prostatectomy,inguinal hernia, and congenital absence of the vas deferens. Disorders of intercourse include erectile dysfunction(inability to achie that can interfere with fertility. Female causative factors are classified into three majorcategories: ovulatory dysfunction, tubal and pelvic pathol-ogy, and cervical mucus factor (Frey & Patel, 2004).Ovulatory dysfunction includes anovulation or inconsistentovulation. These factors affect 15%-25% of couples experi-encing infertility and have a very high success rate withappropriate treatment (Storment, 2006). Tubal and pelvic pathology include (1) damage to the fallopi-an tubes most commonly related to previous pelvic inflamma-tory disease or endometriosis and (2) uterine fibroids, benign growths of the muscular wall of the uterus, which can cause anarrowing of the uterine cavity and interfere with embryonicand fetal development, causing a spontaneous abortion. Cervical mucus factors include (1) cervical surgeries such ascryotherapy, a medical intervention used to treat cervicaldysplasia, and (2) infection. These may interfere with theability of sperm to survive or enter the uterus.CRITICAL COMPONENT Umbilical Vessels After delivery of the newborn, assess the number of vessels inthe cord. Newborns with two vessels (one artery and one vein) have a20% chance of having a cardiac or other vascular defect. Document the number of vessels present in the newborn.Record and report abnormalities to the pediatrician or pediatric nurse practitioner. INFERTILITY AND REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGY Infertility is defined as the inability to conceive and maintain a pregnancy after 12 months (6 months for woman older than35 years old age) of unprotected sexual intercourse. Morethan 5 million couples experience difficulties in conceiving(Storment, 2006). In approximately 80% of these couples, acause can be identified. Infertility affects the physical, social,psychological, sexual, and economic dimensions of the cou-ple's lives.3704_Ch03_025-044 03/10/13 2:48 PM Page 39UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 40 Diagnosis of Infertility When a couple is experiencing difficulty in conceiving, boththe man and the woman need to be evaluated. Initial screen-ing for the female partner can be provided by her gynecologist(history, physical examination, and pelvic examination)(Table 3-5). Initial screening for the male partner should beperformed by a urologist and includes history and physical(Table 3-6). The couple may be referred to a reproductivespecialist after this initial screening. Common Diagnostic Tests Screening for sexually transmitted illnesses (STIs) Laboratory test to assess hormonal levels (TSH, FSH,LH, and testosterone) Semen analysisThe male partner abstains for 2-3 days before providing amasturbated sample of his semen. Specimens are either collected at the site of testing orbrought to the site within an hour of collection. The semen analysis includes volume, sperm concentration,motility, morphology, white blood cell count, immunobead,and mixed agglutination reaction test. Several semen analyses may be required because sperm pro-duction normally fluctuates. Assessing for ovulatory dysfunctionBasal body temperature (BBT): The female partner takesher temperature each morning before rising using a basalthermometer and records her daily temperature. Ovulationhas occurred if there is a rise in the temperature by 0.4\u00b0Ffor 3 consecutive days. Ovarian reserve testing: On day 3 of the menstrual cycle aserum FSH and estradiol test is performed. Further evalu-ation is needed by a reproductive specialist when the FSHis greater than 10 IU/L (Frey & Patel, 2004).CRITICAL COMPONENT Risk Factors for Infertility Women:Autoimmune disordersDiabetesEating disorder s or poor nutrition Excessive alcohol drinkingExcessive exercisingObesityOlder ageSexually transmitted infectionsMen:Environmental tr ansmitted infections Smoking PubMed Health, 2011TABLE 3-5 AREAS OF F OCUS FOR THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE FEMALE PARTNER HISTORY COMPONENTS FOCUS OF ASSESSMENTMEDICAL HIST ORY AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS SURGICAL HISTORY MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY SEXUAL HISTORY INFERTILITY HISTORY SOCIAL HISTORY FAMILY HISTORY OF GENETIC DISEASES Frey & Patel (2004).Abnormal hair growthWeight gainBreast dischargeHypothyroid or hyperthyroid symptoms History of diabetes mellitus or current symptoms of DM Current medical problems and medications Vaccination historyAllergiesFallopian tube surgeryEctopic pregnancyAppendectomyOther pelvic surgeriesAge of menarche Breast developmentDysmenorrheaHistory of sexually transmitted illnesses Use of prior contraceptionHistory of diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure History of abnormal results from Papanicolaou smear and subse-quent treatment Frequency of sexual intercourseTiming of intercourse with basal body temperature charting orovulation predictor kits Dyspareunia (painful intercourse)Use of lubricationsPrevious birthsHistory of infertility treatment in pregnancy Duration of current infertilityUse of alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, recreational drugs Exposure to chemotherapy or radiation Excessive stressAncestry-based genetic diseases, i.e., cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, and thalassemia3704_Ch03_025-044 03/10/13 2:48 PM Page 40CHAPTER 3 Genetics, Conception, Fetal Development, and Reproductive Technology 41 Detecting LH surge: There is a rapid increase in LH 36 hours before ovulation that is referred to as the LH surgeand can be tested with urine or serum. The urine test can beperformed at home and be used to assist in identifying theideal time for intercourse when pregnancy is desired. Endometrial biopsy is performed to assess the response of the uterus to hormonal signals that occur during thecycle. The biopsy is performed at the end of the menstru-al cycle. The procedure is performed in the clinical ormedical office. Hysterosalpingogram is a radiological examination that provides information about the endocervical canal, uterinecavity, and the fallopian tubes. Under fluoroscopic observa-tion, dye is slowly injected through the cervical canal intothe uterus. This examination can detect tubal problemssuch as adhesions or occlusions; and uterus, and uterine fistulas.TABLE 3-6 AREAS OF F OCUS FOR THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE MALE PARTNER HISTORY COMPONENTS FOCUS OF ASSESSMENTMEDICAL HISTORY AND REVIEW OF SYS TEMS SURGICAL HISTORY SEXUAL HISTORY FAMILY HISTORY OF GENETIC DISEASES Frey & Patel (2004).General healthErectile functionDegree of virilizationHistory of sexually transmitted (mumps), genital trauma, or undescendedtesticle Pubertal developmentHistory of exposure to high tem- peratures (hot tubs) or recentfever Current medical problems and medications such as calciumchannel blockers Vaccination historyAllergiesHistory of hernia or testicular Previously fathered a pregnancyHistory of contraception useHistory of infertility in a previous relationship Excessive use of lubricantsAncestry-based genetic diseases, i.e., cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, and thalassemia Family history of male infertilityLaparoscopy is performed with a laparoscope that is usedto visualize and inspect the ovaries, fallopian tubes, andthe uterus for abnormalities such as endometriosis andscarring. Treatment Treatment for the male partner ranges from lifestylechanges to surgery.Treatment for endocrine factors may include hormonaltherapy. Treatment for abnormal sperm count may focus on lifestylechanges such as stress reduction, improved nutrition, elimi-nation of tobacco, and elimination of drugs known to havean adverse effect on fertility. Treatment for sperm antibodies is corticosteroids to decreasethe production of antibodies. Treatment for infections of the genitourinary tract mayinclude antibiotics. Treatment for sperm transport factor may include repair of varicocele or inguinal hernia. Treatment for disorders related to intercourse mayinclude surgery such as transurethral resection of ejaculatory ducts. Treatment for the female partner also ranges fromlifestyle changes to surgery.Treatment for anovulation can focus on lifestyle changessuch as stress reduction, improved nutrition, eliminationof tobacco, and elimination of drugs known to have an adverse effect on fertility. Treatment also includes the use of a variety of medications that stimulate eggproduction. The most common medication used isclomiphene citrate. Treatment for tubal abnormalities may include surgery toopen the tubes. Treatment for uterine fibroids may include surgicalremoval of the fibroids known as a myomectomy. Treatment for cervical factor related to infection is antibiotics. Medication Clomiphene Citrate Indication: Anovulatory stimulatesovulation Common side effects: Hot discomfort,headaches, insomnia Route and dose: PO; 50-200 mg/day from cycle day 3-7. (Data from Vallerand & Sanoski, 2013) Common Methods of Assisted Fertility When the previously mentioned treatments are not successful,the couple is usually referred to an infertility expert. This is anobstetrician who has specialized in infertility. Additional test-ing is done, and based on the outcome there are a variety ofprocedures that can be used to assist in fertility (Table 3-7).3704_Ch03_025-044 03/10/13 2:48 PM Page 41UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 42 TABLE 3-7 COMMON ASSISTED FERTILITY TECHNOLOGY ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION (AI): Intracer vical IntrauterinePartner's TRANSFER (ZIFT) GAMETE INTRAFALLOPIAN TRANSFER (GIFT) EMBRYO TRANSFER (ET)Sperm that has been removed from semen is deposited directly into the cervix or uterus using a plastic catheter. The sample is collected by masturbation and the sperm is sepa-rated from the semen and prepared for insemination. Sperm can be from the partner orfrom a donor when the male partner does not produce sperm. Examples of fertility conditions where this procedure is used include (1) poor cervical mucus production as a result of previous surgery of the cervix, (2) anti-sperm antibodies,(3) diminished amount of sperm, and (4) diminished sperm motility. Sperm are aspirated or extracted directly from the testicles. Sperm are then microinjected into the harvested eggs of the female partner. Examples of fertility conditions where this procedure is used is with men who (1) had an unsuccessful vasectomy reversal, (2) have an absence of vas deferens, and (3) have anextremely low sperm count or no sperm in their ejaculated semen. IVF is a procedure in which oocytes are harvested and fertilization occurs outside the female body in a laboratory. In ZIFT, a zygote is placed into the fallopian tube via laparoscopy 1 day after the oocyte is retrieved from the woman and IVF is used. In GIFT, sperm and oocytes are mixed outside of the woman's body and then placed into the fallopian tube via laparoscopy. Fertilization takes place inside the fallopian tube. Examples of fertility conditions in which these procedures are used are (1) a history of failed infertility treatment for anovulation, (2) unexplained infertility, and (3) low sperm count. ET is when through IVF an embryo is placed in the uterine cavity via a catheter.Example of fertility condition in which this procedure is used is when the fallopian tubes are blocked. Emotional Implications Couples experience a \"roller coaster\" effect during diag-nosis and treatment. Each month they become excitedand hopeful that they will conceive, and then the womanhas a period and their excitement and hopes turn to sadness and possibly depression. Infertility can be seen as a crisis in the couple's lives andrelationship (Sherrod, 2004). Diagnosis and treatment of infertility can cause:Stress, anxiety, and depression for both the female and/ormale partner One or both partners may experience guilt and blame him- orherself or the partner for the inability to conceiv e. Strain between the partners Sexual activity becomes prescribed due to the type of testingreq uired and the method of treatment, causing sexual dysfunc- tion (Read, 2004). Strain within the extended family The couple may avoid family gatherings, especially those thatinv olve children because they remind them of their infertility problems. Social isolation Some couples withdraw from social interaction because it is too painful to be around ot her couples who have children.Some couples do not share with others that they are experiencingproblems with fer tility; thus, they do no t have people who can be supportive during diagnosis and treatment. Self-esteem issues The individual's self-esteem can be affected by infertility. The woman may feel less like a woman because she cannot con-ceive, or the man may feel less like a man when he canno t impregnate his partner. The man or woman may feel like he or she has a defective bodyand is ashamed of it. CounselingMost couples can benefit from counseling during the time ofdiagnosis and treatment and after treatment has stopped. Ideally, counseling should start before treatment begins.Couples may have too high expectations regarding repro-ductive technology and may not want to recognize thattreatment may not be successful. Counseling includes: Discussion on how treatment may have an effect onthem as a couple, as an individual, and as a family Discussion on the dif ferent treatment methods and any ethical dilemmas that might be r elated to these tr eatments Discussion on the effects, consequences, and resolutionof treatment Discussion on when to stop tr eatment Discussion on adoption3704_Ch03_025-044 03/10/13 2:48 PM Page 42CHAPTER 3 Genetics, Conception, Fetal Development, and Reproductive Technology 43 Evidence-Based Practice Research Olshanky, E. (2003). A theoretical explanation for previously infertile mothers'vulnerability to depression. Journal of Nursing Scholarship, 35, 263-268. Since the 1980s, the focus of the research of Ellen Olshanky,DNSc, RNC, has been on the psychosocial effects of infertility.In this article, Dr. Olshanky synthesized the results of severalgrounded theory studies on the experience of infertility andsummarized her theory of identity as infertility. According toher theory: Women who are distressed by their infertility become con-sumed with concerns about the infertility and often neglecttheir relationships with friends, spouse, or family members.This can lead to social isolation. Infertility becomes the focus of the marriage or couple rela-tionship, and other aspects of the relationship are oftenignored. This can lead to a dysfunctional marriage or couplerelationship. Career women may experience a sense of loss of self due tothe shift of focus from career to infertility. This also con-tributes to social isolation. Once pregnancy has been achieved, women often have diffi-culty perceiving themselves as pregnant women. Ethical Implications Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are treatments that involve the surgical removal of the oocytes and combin-ing them with sperm in a laboratory setting. These treatmentsinclude IVF, ZIFT, GIFT, and ET. ART has creatednumerous ethical dilemmas. The primary one is what to do with the \"surplus\" embryos. This refers to the embryosproduced from hyperstimulation of the ovaries that occurswhen IVF technologies are being used. Several eggs from thewoman may be harvested and fertilized using IVF, but onlytwo or three are returned to the woman's body. The \"surplus\"embryos are either frozen for future use or allowed to perish.This has raised the question of when life begins and the rightsof the embryo. Other ethical questions that arise are:Who owns the embryos\u2014the woman or the man? Who decides what will happen with the \"surplus\" embryos? Who has access to ART, as health insurance providersmay not pay for the costs of ART? At what point should the health care provider tell thecouple to stop using ART? When artificial insemination with donor sperm is used,do you tell the child and if so, when? Does the sperm donor have any rights or responsibilitiesregarding the child produced from his donation? The Nurse's Role The role of the nurse varies based on where he or she interfaces with the couple who is experiencing infertility. Nurses who work in an infertility clinic take on a varietyof roles (e.g., counseling, teaching, supporting, and assist-ing in the procedures).Nurses, whether they work in acute care settings or inclinics, need to be aware of the emotional impact infer-tility has on the individual as well as on the couple.Couples become frustrated when they work with healthcare professionals who do not understand the effectinfertility has on their lives (Sherrod, 2004). CRITICAL COMPONENT Infertility The experience of infertility has an effect on the individual'sas well as the couple's emotional well-being. Nurses' awareness of how infertility affects all aspects of theindividual's and of the couple's relationship will enhance theeffectiveness of the nursing care provided to these couples orindividuals.

The focus of nursing care during the preconception and antepartum period is:Prior to pregnancy:Assessment of the health of the woman and potential riskfactors Education on health promotion and disease prevention During pregnancy:Regular assessment of the health of the pregnancy Regular assessment and screening of risk factors for poten-tial complications Education on health promotion and disease prevention Inclusion of significant others/family in care and educationto promote pregnancy adaptation Implementation of appropriate interventions based on riskstatus or actual complications PRECONCEPTION HEALTH CARE Preconception care is defined as a set of interventions that aim to identify medical, behavioral, and social risks to a woman'shealth or pregnancy outcome through prevention and manage-ment (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC],2006). Preconception care consists of health promotion, riskscreening, and implementation of interventions for childbearing-aged women before a pregnancy with the goal of modifying risk factors that could negatively impact a pregnancy (CDC,2006; Table 4-1). This care is critical because several risk behaviors (i.e., smoking) and exposures negatively affect fetaldevelopment and pregnancy outcomes (see Critical Component:Preconception Health Care). In addition, because almost half ofpregnancies are unintended (i.e., mistimed or unwanted at thetime of conception), preconception care optimizes a woman'shealth for a potential pregnancy (Martin, Hamilton, Menacker,Sutton, & Mathews, 2007). CRITICAL COMPONENT Preconception Health Care Assessing a woman for risk factors and implementing interven-tions when appropriate can positively impact her current orfuture health as well as the health of any future pregnancies,resulting in better health outcomes for women and families(CDC, 2006). Routine Physical Examination and Screening Two of the primary components of a preconception healthcare visit are a physical examination and relevant healthscreening in the form of laboratory or diagnostic testing (seeTable 4-1).The physical examination includes:Height and weight measurements to calculate BMI andassess whether at a healthy weight Comprehensive physical examination Breast examination Pelvic examination TABLE 4-1 COMPONENTS OF HEALTH HISTORY AND RISK FACTOR ASSESSMENT IN PRECONCEPTION CARE COMPONENT PURPOSE AND ACTIONS IDENTIFYING INFORMATIONAge, gravida/par a, address, race/ethnicity, religion, marital/family status, occupation, education HEALTH STATUSPrior and present health statusTo determine specific risks based on sociodemographic characteristics\u0081Provide education and anticipatory guidance. \u0081To identify psychosocial resources and available sources of support (See Chapt er 5 f or detailed information on psychosocial and cultural assessment.) \u0081Refer for social services, counseling services, spiritual support.

Preconception Anticipatory Guidance and Education Anticipatory guidance is the provision of information andguidance to women and their families that enables them tobe knowledgeable and prepared as the process of pregnancyand childbirth unfolds. Anticipatory guidance and educa-tion in the childbearing-aged population spans topics from health maintenance, self-care, and lifestyle choices tocontraception and safety behaviors. The nurse is key in pro-viding this aspect of care. It is imperative that a woman's age, sexual orientation, culture, religion, and additional val-ues and beliefs are acknowledged and respected, and thatthis information is incorporated appropriately into thenurse's teaching plan Preconception Education The goal of preconception education is to provide a womanwith information she can use to enhance her health beforebecoming pregnant. When a woman seeks care specificallybecause she is planning for a future pregnancy, more emphasisis placed on counseling and anticipatory guidance related topreparation and planning for a pregnancy. Preconception anticipatory guidance and education topics: Nutrition Prenatal vitamins ExerciseSelf-care Contraception cessation Timing of conception Modifying behaviors to reduce risks Nutrition Maintaining a healthy weight is especially important forwomen planning a pregnancy. The body mass index (BMI),a number calculated based on a person's height and weight,represents a measure of body fat. The BMI can be used as aneasy method of screening the nutritional status of women andto identify weight categories that may lead to health prob-lems. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) use the followingtable to interpret the BMI (see Box 4-1). Currently 35.7% of adults in the United States are obese (Ogden, Carroll, Kit, & Flegal, 2012).The number of womenin childbearing years who are overweight or obese has grownover the last three decades, and maternal obesity prior to con-ception has been linked to childhood obesity in their offspring(Whitaker, 2004). Taking into consideration the lifelonghealth consequences associated with obesity, the IOM pub-lished new guidelines in 2009 recommending that womenachieve their normal BMI prior to conceiving (see CriticalComponent: Pre-Pregnancy Weight). CRITICAL COMPONENT Pre-Pregnancy Weight An overweight or obese pre-pregnancy weight increases therisk for poor maternal and neonatal outcomes and may havefar-reaching implications for long-term health and develop-ment of chronic disease. At the other end of the spectrum,underweight pre-pregnancy weight and/or inadequate weightgain increases the risk for poor fetal growth and low birthweight. Women who are either significantly overweight orunderweight should be referred for dietary counseling andplanning in order to achieve a healthier weight before concep-tion.

Complications during childbirth due to large for gestationalage (LGA) infants and macrosomia Prolonged labor and difficult delivery Cesarean delivery Postpartum hemorrhage Poor wound healing following a cesarean birth.Given the detrimental influence of maternal overweight and obesity on reproductive and pregnancy outcomes for themother and child, it is the position of the American DieteticAssociation and the American Society for Nutrition that alloverweight and obese women of reproductive age shouldreceive counseling prior to pregnancy, during pregnancy, andin the interconceptional period on the roles of diet and phys-ical activity in reproductive health, in order to amelioratethese adverse outcomes (American Dietetic Association andAmerican Society for Nutrition, 2009). Poor perinatal outcomes can also result from inadequate maternal weight during pregnancy such as small for gesta-tional age (SGA) infants and preterm Leveno, Bloom, Hauth,Rouse, & Sprong, 2010). Nutritional education for women of childbearing years: Educate on diet and physical activity and their role inreproductive health. Advise on the importance of achieving and maintaining ahealthy weight prior to conception. Encourage nutritious food choices with an emphasis onfresh fruits and vegetables, lean protein sources, low-fator non-fat dairy foods, whole grains, and small amountsof healthy fats. Help choose appropriate foods and serving sizes (seeFig. 4-8). Prenatal Vitamins Many women planning a pregnancy begin taking a prenatalvitamin supplement. Prenatal vitamins contain a wide rangeof vitamins and minerals important for good health duringpregnancy:Folic acid supplementation: Decreases risk of neural tubedefects (see Critical Component: Folic Acid Supplements).Calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D: Contribute to bonehealth and osteoporosis prevention throughout the lifespan, including during the childbearing years. Iron supplementation is commonly prescribed duringpregnancy, although there is some controversy about thebenefit of this practice as a routine recommendation. A woman who is anticipating a short time periodbetween pregnancies is at risk for iron-deficiency anemia.Iron supplementation may be prescribed, and she isencouraged to include iron-rich foods in her diet inbetween pregnancies since she is likely to have reducediron stores and may also be anemic from the previousrecent pregnancy. Megadoses of vitamins and minerals are not recommended,as they may be toxic to the developing fetus. BOX 4-1 BMI SCALE 30.0 World Health Organization (2011). CRITICAL COMPONENT Folic Acid Supplements In 1992, the CDC began recommending daily folic acid supple-mentation of 0.4 mg daily for childbearing-aged women afterfolic acid was shown to reduce the incidence of neural tubedefects (NTDs) such as spina bifida, with an expected reduc-tion in NTD incidence in the United States of 50%. The benefi-cial impact of folic acid supplementation is greatest between 1 month before pregnancy and through the first trimester, theperiod of neural tube development (CDC, 1992) Exercise A program of regular exercise positively impacts a woman'shealth and may generally be continued once she has con-ceived. It is best to implement such a program several monthsin advance of conception so that when pregnancy occurs, regular exercise is already comfortable and routine. Womenembarking on a new exercise regime may want to confer withtheir providers.Some form of aerobic activity, including regular weight-bearing exercise such as walking or running, as well asstretching exercises and some type of weight work/musclestrengthening together provide overall body conditioning. The weight-bearing exercise and weight/strengtheningwork also enhance bone health and help prevent osteoporosis. Self-Care Most women are pregnant for at least 1-2 weeks before beingaware of their pregnancy. For this reason, it is helpful tocounsel the preconception woman to decrease risk behaviorsand eliminate exposure to substances that are known or suspected to be harmful during gestation as soon as she stopsusing contraception or begins trying to become pregnant (Fig. 4-1). The woman should avoid:Alcohol Tobacco Secondhand smoke3704_Ch04_045-086 16/09/13 10:05 AM Page 49UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 50 Excessive use of caffeine Illicit drugs Medications contraindicated in pregnancy (prescription,over-the-counter, and herbal supplements) Environmental toxinsThe woman should be encouraged to: Use safer sex practices to prevent STIs Use seat belts in a car Ensure that smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detec-tors are in working order Apply sunscreen when outdoors Maintain adequate relaxation and sleep Maintain optimal oral health and treat any periodontaldisease before pregnancy, as it has been associated withadverse pregnancy outcomes including preterm birth andlow birth weight (CDC, 2006). Discuss the use of complementary or alternative medicinemodalities, such as acupuncture, herbal supplements,homeopathy, and massage, with her primary health careprovider. Some of these interventions may need to be discontinued before a pregnancy for safety reasons. Contraception Cessation Before conception, it is ideal for a woman to have at least twoor three normal menstrual periods. For all women planning apregnancy, discontinuation of contraception and tracking ofmenstrual cycles will aid in facilitating conception and subse-quently in dating the pregnancy once conception is achieved.Women using some form of hormonal contraceptionneed to stop hormonal contraception and begin the use ofa barrier method of birth control or fertility awarenessfamily planning techniques for the next few monthsbefore conception. Women using Depo-Provera for contraception need to beinformed that it may take from several months up to morethan a year to conceive after discontinuing injections. Women using an intrauterine device (IUD) need to havethe device removed.Timing of Conception Many women are interested in learning more about theirmenstrual cycles in order to gain more control over their abil-ity to conceive.Preconception counseling can include basic informationabout the menstrual cycle, when in the cycle a woman isable to conceive, signs of ovulation, the life span of ovumand sperm, and how to time sexual intercourse in order toincrease the likelihood of conception. Women who have used fertility awareness family plan-ning principles are familiar with these concepts and cansimply reverse the behaviors they practiced when usingthe method to avoid conception. Modifying Behaviors to Reduce Risk With each topic of conversation in preconception counsel-ing, women gain information allowing them to positivelyaffect their overall health and reduce perinatal risk. Severalfactors contribute to risk reduction or elimination by modifying risk factors related to preexisting medical conditions, high-risk behaviors, and self-care and safetybehavior deficits to improve outcomes of future pregnancies(Evidence-Based Practice: Recommendations to ImprovePreconception Health and Health Care in the UnitedStates). Nursing Actions in Preconception Care Provide comfort and privacy. Use therapeutic communication techniques. Obtain the health history. Conduct a review of systems. Provide teaching about procedures. Assist with physical and pelvic exams. Assist with obtaining specimens. Provide anticipatory guidance and education related toplan of care and appropriate follow-up. Assess the patient's understanding. Provide education, recommendations, and referrals to help women make appropriate behavioral, lifestyle,or medical changes based on history or physical examination. Figure 4-1 Nurse providing anticipatory guidance and education on self-care. Evidence-Based Practice: Recommendations toImprove Preconception Health and Health Carein the United States The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) rec-ommendations emphasize that preconception care is not limited to a single visit to a health professional but is aprocess of care that is designed to meet the needs of a womanduring the different stages of her reproductive life. All womenof reproductive age are candidates for preconception care;however, preconception care must be tailored to meet theneeds of the individual (CDC, 2006; Jack, Atrash, Coonrod,Moos, O'Donnell, Johnson, 2008).3704_Ch04_045-086 Page 50CHAPTER 4 Physiological Aspects of Antepartum Care 51 See Table 4-2 for categories of clinical content for precon- ception care. Preconception Care for Men Preconception care for men offers an opportunity, similarto the opportunity it presents for women, for disease prevention and health promotion. In addition, preconcep-tion care for men is an important factor in improving family planning and pregnancy outcomes for women,enhancing the reproductive health and health behaviors of men and their partners, and preparing for fatherhood.The CDC recommends that each male planning with hispartner to conceive a pregnancy should have a comprehen-sive medical evaluation for the purposes of preventing andfinding disease and providing preconception education.Management should be optimized for any high-riskbehaviors or poorly controlled disease states prior toattempting conception (Frey, Navarro, Kotelchuck, & Lu,2008).DIAGNOSIS OF PREGNANCY The diagnostic confirmation of pregnancy is based on a com-bination of the presumptive, probable, and positive changes/signs of pregnancy. This information is obtained through his-tory, physical and pelvic examinations, and laboratory anddiagnostic studies. Presumptive Signs of Pregnancy The presumptive signs of pregnancy include all subjective signs of pregnancy (i.e., physiological changes perceived bythe woman herself):Amenorrhea: Absence of menstruation Nausea and vomiting: Common from week 2-12 Breast changes: Changes begin to appear at 2 to 3 weeksEnlargement, tenderness, and tingling of breasts Increased vascularity of breasts TABLE 4-2 CATEGORIES OF CLNICAL CONTENT FOR PRECONCEPTION CARE Health Promotion\u0081Family Planning and Reproductive Life Plan \u0081Weight \u0081Physical AM Page 51UNIT 2 Antepartal 52 Fatigue: Common during the first trimester Urination frequency: Related to pressure of enlarginguterus on bladder; decreases as uterus moves upward andout of pelvis Quickening: A woman's first awareness of occurs 18-20 weeks' gestation in primigravidas(between 14-16 weeks in multigravidas)All of these changes could have causes outside of preg- nancy and are not considered diagnostic. Probable Signs of Pregnancy The probable signs of pregnancy are objective signs of preg- nancy and include all physiological and anatomical changesthat can be perceived by the health care provider:Chadwick's sign: Bluish-purple coloration of the vaginal seen at 6-8 weeks Goodell's sign: Softening of the cervix and vagina increased leukorrheal discharge; palpated at 8 weeks Hegar's sign: Softening of the lower uterine segment; palpated at 6 weeks Uterine growth and abdominal growth Skin hyperpigmentationMelasma (chloasma), also referred to as the mask of preg- nancy: Brownish pigmentation over the forehead, temples,cheek, and/or upper lip Linea nigra: Dark line that runs from the umbilicus to the pubis Nipples and areola: Become darker; more evident inprimigravidas and dark-haired women Ballottement: A light tap of the examining finger on the cervix causes fetus to rise in the amniotic fluid and thenrebound to its original position; occurs at 16-18 weeks Positive pregnancy test resultsLaboratory tests are based on detection of the presence ofhuman chorionic gonadatropin (hCG) in maternal urineor blood. The tests are extremely accurate, but not 100%. There canbe both false-positive and false-negative results. Because ofthis, a positive pregnancy test is considered a probablerather than a positive sign of pregnancy. A maternal blood pregnancy test can detect hCG levelsbefore a missed period. A urine pregnancy test is best performed using a first morningurine specimen, which has the highest concentration of hCG,and becomes positive about 4 weeks after conception. Home pregnancy tests are also accurate (but not 100%)and are simple to perform. These urine tests use enzymesand rely on a color change when agglutination occurs,indicating a pregnancy. The home tests can be performedat the time of a missed menstrual period or as early as 1 week before a missed period. If a negative result occurs,the instructions suggest that the test be repeated in oneweek if a menstrual period has not begun. All of these changes could also have causes other than preg- nancy and are not considered diagnostic. The presumptive andprobable signs of pregnancy are important components of theassessment in confirming a pregnancy. Early in gestation,before any positive signs of pregnancy, a combination of presumptive and probable signs is used to make a practicaldiagnosis of pregnancy. Positive Signs of Pregnancy The positive signs of pregnancy are the objective signs of pregnancy (noted by the examiner) that can only be attributedto the fetus:Auscultation of the fetal heart, by 10-12 weeks' gestationwith a Doppler Observation and palpation of fetal movement by theexaminer after about 20 weeks' gestation Sonographic visualization of the fetus: Cardiac movementnoted at 4-8 weeks Sonographic Diagnosis of Pregnancy Ultrasound using a vaginal probe can confirm a pregnancyslightly earlier than with the transabdominal method. With a transvaginal ultrasound the gestational sac is visible by 4.5-5 weeks' gestation and fetal cardiac movement can beobserved as early as 4 weeks' gestation. Ultrasound visualiza-tion of a pregnancy has increasingly become a routine andexpected part of prenatal care. Indications for ultrasoundexamination of an early pregnancy for purposes of diagnosisinclude:Pelvic pain or vaginal bleeding in the first trimester History of repeated pregnancy loss or ectopic pregnancy(the implantation of a fertilized ovum outside the uterus) Uncertain menstrual history Discrepancy between actual size and expected size ofpregnancy based on history PREGNANCY The antepartum (antepartal) period, also referred to as the prenatal period, begins with the first day of the last normalmenstrual period (LMP) and ends with the onset of labor (known as the intrapartal period). Pregnancy is also counted in terms of trimesters, each roughly 3 months in length:TrimestersFirst trimester: First day of LMP through 14 completed weeks Second trimester: 15 weeks through 28 completed weeksThird trimester: 29 weeks through 40 completed weeks Calculation of Due Date An important piece of information to share with a newlypregnant woman and her family is her \"due date\" or estimat-ed date of birth (EDB). It is more commonly known now as estimated date of delivery (EDD). This date represents a best estimation as to when a full-term infant will be born.3704_Ch04_045-086 16/09/13 10:05 AM Page 52CHAPTER 4 Physiological Aspects of Antepartum Care 53 The original term used for this date was the estimated date ofconfinement (EDC). Calculation of the EDD is best accomplished with a known and certain last menstrual period date (LMP). Othertools are used to determine the most accurate EDD possibleif the LMP is not known and are used throughout the preg-nancy to confirm EDD based on an LMP. These tools are:Physical examination to determine uterine size First auscultation of fetal heart rate with a Dopplerand/or a fetoscope (stethoscope for auscultation of fetalheart tones) Date of quickening Ultrasound examination History of assisted reproduction Naegele's Rule Naegele's rule is the standard formula for determining an EDD based on the LMP. The formula is: First day ofLMP - 3 months + 7 days (see Box 4-2).41st week of pregnancy. According to the American Academy ofPediatrics (AAP) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) (2007), neonates born prior to 37 completed weeks (<37 6/7 weeks or <259 days) of pregnancyare referred to as preterm, and those delivered after 42 weeks (>426/7 or >294) are classified as post term (AAP & ACOG, 2007). Weeks of Gestation Once an EDD has been determined, a pregnancy is countedin terms of weeks of gestation beginning with the first day ofthe LMP and ending with 40 completed weeks (the EDD).A useful tool for quickly and easily calculating the EDD is thegestational wheel (Fig. 4-2), but it is less reliable thanNaegele's rule due to variations of up to a few days betweenwheels. It is best to calculate a due date initially usingNaegele's rule and then employ a gestational wheel to deter-mine a woman's current gestational age. To use the gestational wheel, place the arrow labeled \"first day of last period\" from the inner circle on the date of theLMP on the outer circle. The EDD is then read as the dateon the outside circle that lines up with the arrow at 40 com-pleted weeks on the inside circle. With the example the LMPis ________ and the EDD is ________. Prenatal Assessment Terminology A set of terms is used to describe obstetrical history and todefine a woman's obstetrical status. An important shorthandsystem for explaining a woman's obstetrical history uses the BOX 4-2 GESTATIONAL AGE Gestational age refers to the number of completed weeks of fetaldevelopment, calculated from the first day of the last normalmenstrual period. Embryologists date fetal age and developmentfrom the time of conception (known as conceptual or embry-ological age), which is usually 2 weeks less. Unless otherwisespecified, all references to dating or fetal age in this textbook willbe gestational ages (based on time since the last menstrual peri-od and not time since conception).FORMULA FOR NAEGELE'S RULE LMP Sept 7 -3 monthsJune 7+7 days EDD June 14 Figure 4-2 Gestational wheel. To use the gestational wheel, place the arrow labeled \"first day of last period\"from the inner circle on the date of the LMP on the outercircle. The EDD is then read as the date on the outside circle that lines up with the arrow at 40 completed weekson the inside circle. With the example in Figure 4-2, theLMP is Sept 7 and the EDD is June 14.It is important to remember that the EDD as deter- mined by Naegele's rule is only a best guess of when a babyis likely to be born. Two factors influence the accuracy ofNaegele's rule:Regularity of a woman's menstrual cycles Length of a woman's menstrual cyclesResults may not be accurate if menstrual cycles are not reg-ular or are greater than 28 days apart. Most women give birth within the time period of 3 weeks before to 2 weeks after their EDD. The length of pregnancy isapproximately 280 days or 40 weeks from the first day of theLMP. In recent years there has been conflicting or inconsistentinformation on the definition of a \"term\" pregnancy. The windowfor term gestation has traditionally been defined as between the 5 weeks from 37 to 42 weeks from the LMP. Statisticians or someexperts now define term pregnancy as one that begins after the 37th competed week of pregnancy through the end of the 3704_Ch04_045-086 16/09/13 10:05 AM Page 53UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 54 GTPALM may be used, and the M represents pregnan-cies with multiple gestations. Nulligravida is a woman who has never been pregnant or given birth. Primigravida is a woman who is pregnant for the first time. Multigravida is someone who is pregnant for at least the second time. PHYSIOLOGICAL PROGRESSION OF PREGNANCY Pregnancy results in maternal physiologic adaptationsinvolving every body system. Every change has either themaintenance of the pregnancy, the development of the fetus,or preparation for the labor and birth as its basis and is pro-tective of the woman and/or the fetus. To both understand awoman's experience of normal pregnancy and be effective inidentifying deviations from normal, the nurse must have abasic foundation in the physiology of pregnancy. This understanding is critical not only for risk assessment and implementation of appropriate nursing interventions toreduce risk but also for providing effective patient educationand anticipatory guidance grounded in knowledge of thephysiological basis for the normal physical changes in preg-nancy and their resulting common, and normal, discomforts.The next sections present the changes that occur in each sys-tem, and Table 4-3 summarizes the major physiological changes and factors that influence these changes.terms gravida and para in describing numbers of pregnancies and births.G/P is a two-digit system to denote pregnancy and birth history.Gravida refers to the total number of times a woman has been pregnant, without reference to how many fetuses therewere with each pregnancy or when the pregnancy ended. Itis simply how many times a woman has been pregnant,including the current pregnancy. Para refers to the number of births after 20 weeks' gestation whether live births or stillbirths. There is no reference to num-ber of fetuses delivered with this system, so twins count as onedelivery, just like a singleton birth. A pregnancy that endsbefore the end of 20 weeks' gestation is considered an abortion,whether it is spontaneous (miscarriage) or induced (elective ortherapeutic), and is not counted using the G/P system. GTPAL (meaning gravida, term, para, abortion, and living) is a more comprehensive system that gives informationabout each infant from prior pregnancies. This system designates numbers of infants as follows:G= total number of times pregnant (same as G/P system above) T= number of term infants born (after 37 completed or 37 6/7 weeks' gestation) P= number of preterm infants born between 20 and 37 completed weeks' gestation or 37 6/7 weeks) A= number of abortions (either spontaneous or induced) before 20 weeks' gestation (or <500 grams at birth) L= the number of children currently living. Tenderness, feeling of fullness, and tingling sensationIncrease in weight of breast by 400 gramsEnlargement of breasts, nipples, areola, and Montgomery follicles (small glands on the areola around the nipple) Striae: Due to stretching of skin to accommodate enlarging breast tissueProminent veins due to a twofold increase in blood flowIncreased growth of mammary glandsIncrease in lactiferous ducts and alveolar systemProduction of colostrum, a yellow secretion rich in antibodies, begins to be produced as early as 16 weeks Hypertrophy of uterine wallSoftening of vaginal muscle and connective tissue in preparation for expan- sion of tissue to accommodate passage of fetus through the birth canal Uterus contractibility increases in response to increased estrogen levels, lead- ing to Braxton-Hicks contractions. Hypertrophy of cervical glands leads to formation of mucus plug, which serves as a protective barrier between uterus/fetus and vagina. Increased vascularity and hypertrophy of vaginal and cervical glands leads to increase in leukorrhea.

RESPIRATORY SYSTEMHormones of pregnancy stimulate the respiratory center and act on lung tissue to increase and enhance respiratory function. Increase of oxygen consumption by 15%-20% Estrogen, progesterone, and prostaglandins cause vascular engorgement and smooth muscle relaxation.Increase in uterine size to 20 times that of non-pregnant uterusWeight of uterus increases from 70 grams to 1,100 grams.Capacity increases from 10 ml to 5000 ml; 80% of that to uteroplacental Blood flow to the uterus is 500-600 mL/min at term.Goodell's sign: Softening of the cervixHegar's of the lower uterine segmentChadwick's sign: Bluish coloration of cervix, vaginal mucosa, and vulvaAcid environment inhibits growth of bacteria.Acid environment allows growth of Candida albicans , leading to increased risk of candidiasis (yeast infection).

The uterus under-goes phenomenal growth, breasts prepare for lactation, andthe vagina changes to accommodate the birthing process(Fig. 4-3). Breasts Breast changes begin early in pregnancy and continuethroughout gestation and into the postpartum period. Thesechanges are primarily influenced by increases in hormone levels and occur in preparation for lactation (see Table 4-3). Uterus The uterus is described in three parts:Fundus or upper portion Isthmus or lower segment Cervix, the lower narrow part, or neck; the external part of the cervix interfaces with the vagina. The Cervical Osis the opening of the cervix that dilates (opens) duringlabor to allow passage of the fetus through the vagina.Uterine changes over the course of pregnancy are profound (see Table 4-3).Before pregnancy, this elastic, muscular organ is the sizeand shape of a small pear weighing 40-50 g.During pregnancy, the uterine wall progressively thins asthe uterus expands to accommodate the developing fetus. By mid-pregnancy, the uterine fundus reaches the level ofthe umbilicus abdominally. Toward the end of pregnancy, the enlarged uterus, con-taining a full-term fetus, fills the abdominal cavity andhas altered the placement of the lungs and rib cage inaddition to the abdominal organs (Fig. 4-4). Intermittent, painless, and physiological uterine contrac-tions, referred to as Braxton-Hicks contractions, begin in the second trimester but some women do not feelthem until the third trimester. These contractions areirregular with no particular pattern. As the uterusenlarges, they are more noticeable. At term, the uterus weighs 1100-1200 g. Vagina The vagina is an elastic muscular canal. As pregnancy pro-gresses, various changes take place in the vasculature and tone(see Table 4-3).An increase of vascularity due to the expanded circulatoryneeds An increase of vaginal discharge (leukorrhea), which isin response to the estrogen-induced hypertrophy of thevaginal glands Relaxation of the vaginal wall and perineal body, which allowsstretching of tissues to accommodate Page 58CHAPTER 4 Physiological Aspects of Antepartum Care 59 Acid pH of the vagina, which inhibits growth of bacteria but allows overgrowth of Candida albicans.This places the pregnant woman at risk for candidiasis(yeast infection). Ovaries The corpus luteum, which normally degrades after ovulationwhen the egg is not fertilized, is maintained during the firstcouple months of pregnancy by high levels of human chorionicgonadatropin (hCG). At the beginning of pregnancy, the cor-pus luteum produces progesterone in order to maintain thethick lining of the uterus, referred to as the endometrium, to allow for implantation and establishment of the pregnancy.There is subsequently no shedding of the endometrium that would result in menstruation. Ovulation ceases as thehormones of pregnancy inhibit follicle maturation and release.By 6-7 weeks' gestation, the placenta begins producing pro - gesterone and the corpus luteum degenerates.Cardiovascular System The cardiovascular system undergoes significant adaptationsduring pregnancy to support the maintenance and developmentof the fetus while also meeting maternal physiological needsduring both the pregnancy and the postpartum period. Thehemodynamic changes are also a protective mechanism for theinevitable maternal blood loss during the intrapartum period(see Table 4-3). Cardiovascular system changes include:Cardiac output (CO) increases 30%-50% and reaches apeak at 25-30 weeks. The heart rate increases 15-20 beats per minute (bpm). Stroke volume increases by 25%-30%. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) increases 10%-20% by thethird trimester. The white blood cell (WBC) count increases, with valuesup to 16,000 mm 3in the absence of infection. The increase is hormonally induced and similar to eleva-tions seen in physiological stress such as exercise. Plasma volume increases 40%-50% during pregnancyuntil reaching a peak about 32-34 weeks and remainingthere until term. In response to increased oxygen requirements of pregnan-cy, the red blood cell (RBC) count increases 30% andRBC volume increases up to 33% with iron supplementa-tion (up to 18% without supplementation).The increase in plasma volume is relatively larger than theincrease in RBCs. This hemodilution is evidenced by decreasedhemoglobin and hematocrit values and is known as physio-logical anemia of pregnancy, or pseudo anemia of pregnancy.See Appendix B for laboratory values during pregnancy. Cardiac work is eased as the decrease in blood viscosityfacilitates placental perfusion. Iron-deficiency anemia is defined as hemoglobin lessthan 11.0 g/dL and hematocrit less than 33%.Maternal iron stores are insufficient to meet the demandsfor iron in fetal development. Blood volume increases by 1,500 mL or by 40%-45% tosupport uteroplacental demands and maintenance of preg-nancy. This is referred to as hypervolemia of pregnancy. The heart enlarges slightly as a result of hypervolemiaand increased cardiac output. The heart shifts upward and laterally as the growinguterus displaces the diaphragm (Fig. 4-5). Hypercoagulation occurs during pregnancy to decreasethe risk of postpartum hemorrhage. These changesplace the woman at risk for thrombosis andcoagulopathies.Plasma fibrin increase of 40% Fibrinogen increase of 50% Coagulation inhibiting factors decrease Blood pressure decreases in the first trimester due to adecrease in peripheral vascular resistance. The blood pressure returns to normal by term.

Physiological changes include: Tidal volume increases 35%-50% Slight respiratory alkalosisDecrease in PCO 2leads to an increase in pH (more alka- line) and decrease in bicarbonate. This change promotes transport of carbon dioxide awayfrom the fetus. Increases in estrogen, progesterone, and prostaglandinscause vascular engorgement and smooth muscle relaxationresulting in edema and tissue congestion, which can lead to:Dyspnea Nasal and sinus congestion Epistaxis (nosebleeds) Anatomical changes include: Diaphragm is displaced upward approximately 4 cm. Increase in chest circumference of 6 cm with an increasein the costal angle of greater than 90 degrees There is a shift from abdominal to thoracic breathing asthe pregnancy progresses (see Fig. 4-5). These anatomical changes may contribute to the physio-logical dyspnea that is common during pregnancy.CRITICAL COMPONENT Supine Hypotensive Syndrome Supine hypotensive syndrome is a hypotensive condition resulting from a woman lying on her back in mid to late preg-nancy ( Fig. 4-6 ). In a supine position, the enlarged uterus compresses the inferior vena cava, leading to a significant dropin cardiac output and blood pressure, and resulting in thewoman feeling dizzy and faint. In the majority of women, a systolic heart murmur or athird heart sound (gallop) may be heard by mid-pregnancy. Peripheral dilation is increased. Varicosities may develop in the legs or vulva as a result ofincreased venous pressure below the level of the uterus. Dependent edema in the lower extremities is caused byincreased venous pressure from the enlarging uterus.Compression of inferior vena cava Figure 4-5 Dotted lines indicate displacement of heart and lungs as pregnancy progresses and uterus enlarges.Figure 4-6 Supine hypotension compression of the inferi- or gravid uterus while in the supine posi-tion reduces venous blood return to the heart causingmaternal hypotension. Respiratory System Throughout the course of pregnancy, the respiratory systemadapts in response to physiological and anatomical demandsrelated to fetal growth and development as well as maternalmetabolic needs (see Table 4-3). Pulmonary function is notcompromised in a normal pregnancy. Renal System The kidneys undergo change during pregnancy as they adaptto perform their basic functions of regulating fluid and elec-trolyte balance, eliminating metabolic waste products, andPATIENT EDUCATION (SEE TABLE 4-4) Educate on the causes of supine and orthostatic hypotensionand advice on self-care measures to prevent a hypotensive event. Encourage the woman to include iron-rich foods and takeiron supplementation to prevent anemia. Instruct the woman in prevention and relief measures fordependent edema and varicosities.PATIENT EDUCATION (SEE TABLE 4-4) Educate and reassure the woman about normal respiratorychanges and suggest symptom relief measures. Encourage the woman to stand and stretch, taking a deepbreath, periodically throughout the day and stretch and takea deep breath periodically throughout the night.3704_Ch04_045-086 16/09/13 10:05 AM Page 65UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 66 helping to regulate blood pressure (see Table 4-3).Physiological changes include: Renal plasma flow increases. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) increases. Renal tubular reabsorption increases. Proteinuria and glucosuria can normally occur in smallamounts related to tubal reabsorption threshold of pro-tein and glucose being exceeded due to increased volume.Even though a small amount of proteinuria and glucosuriacan be normal, it is important to assess and monitor forpathology. Shift in fluid and electrolyte balanceThe need for increased fluid and electrolytes results inalteration of regulating mechanisms including therenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and antidiuretichormone. Positional variation in renal functionIn the supine and upright maternal position, blood pools inthe lower body, causing a decrease in cardiac output, GFR,and urine output; also causing excess sodium and fluidretention. A left lateral recumbent maternal position can: Maximize cardiac output, renal plasma volume, andurine output Stabilize fluid and electrolyte balance Minimize dependent edema Maintain optimal blood pressure These changes support the increased circulatory and meta- bolic demands of the pregnancy because the renal systemsecretes both maternal and fetal waste products. Anatomical changes include: Renal pelvis dilation with increased renal plasma flow Ureter alterationsBecome elongated, tortuous, and dilated Bladder alterationsBladder capacity increases and bladder tone decreases relat-ed to progesterone effect on smooth muscle of the bladdercausing relaxation and stretching. Urinary stasisProgesterone reduces the tone of renal structures, allowingfor pooling of urine. Stasis promotes bacterial growth and increases the woman'srisk for urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis. Hyperemia of bladder and urethra related to increasedvascularity that results in pelvic congestion; edematousmucosa is easily traumatized. Most women experience urinary symptoms of frequen-cy, urgency, and nocturia beginning early in pregnancyand continuing to varying degrees throughout the preg-nancy. These symptoms are primarily a result of thesystemic hormonal changes of pregnancy and may alsobe attributed to anatomical changes in the renal systemand other body system changes during pregnancy, butare not generally indicative of infection. Urinary tractinfections are common in pregnancy and may beasymptomatic (see Critical Component: Urinary TractInfection).CRITICAL COMPONENT Urinary Tract Infection The most common bacterial infection during pregnancy is a uri-nary tract infection (UTI). Physiological changes that occur inthe renal system during pregnancy predispose pregnant womento urinary tract infections. Symptoms of a UTI include urinaryfrequency, dysuria, urgency, and sometimes pus or blood in the urine. Treatment includes anti-infective medication for a 7- to 10-day period. If untreated, the infection can lead topyelonephritis or premature labor. Gastrointestinal System The gastrointestinal (GI) system adapts in its anatomy andphysiology during pregnancy in support of maternal and fetalnutritional requirements (see Table 4-3). The adaptations arerelated to hormonal influences as well as the impact of theenlarging uterus on the GI system as pregnancy progresses. Most pregnant women (90%) experience some degree of nau- sea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP). For the majority of affect-ed women, the symptoms are an expected part of pregnancy andtolerated well; however, about a third of affected women experi-ence significant distress. As the pregnancy progresses, NVPsymptoms usually diminish; 60% of cases resolve by 12 weeks'gestation and 90% have symptom improvement by 16 weeks'gestation (Tan & Omar, 2011). It is important to identifywomen with significant NVP so they can be successfully treated. Additional alterations in nutritional patterns commonly seen in pregnancy include:Increase in appetite and intake Cravings for specific foodsPica is a craving for and consumption of nonfood substances such as starch and clay. It can result in toxicity due toingested substances or malnutrition from replacing nutri-tious foods with nonfood substances. Avoidance of specific foodsAnatomical and physiological changes include: Uterine enlargement displaces the stomach, liver, andintestines as the pregnancy progresses.PATIENT EDUCATION (SEE TABLE 4-4) Educate the woman on reasons for increased frequency ofurination during first and third trimesters. Teach signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection andadvise her to seek prompt treatment if she experiences them. Encourage UTI prevention measures such as: Emptying bladder frequently Wiping front to back Washing hands before and after urination Urinating after intercourse Maintaining adequate hydration with at least 8 glasses ofliquid a day Teach and encourage Kegel exercises and instruct to wearperineal pad if needed.3704_Ch04_045-086 AM Page 66CHAPTER 4 Physiological Aspects of Antepartum Care 67 By the end of pregnancy, the appendix is situated highand to the right along the costal margin. The GI tract experiences a general relaxation and slowingof its digestive processes during pregnancy, contributingto many of the common discomforts of pregnancy such asheartburn, abdominal bloating, and constipation. Hemorrhoids (varicosities in the anal canal) are common inpregnancy due to increased venous pressure and are exacer-bated by constipation. 30%-40% of expe-rience and/or bleeding. Gallstones: Progesterone-induced relaxation of of gallbladder and slowsemptying of bile; bile stasis and elevated levels choles-terol contribute to formation of gallstones. Pruritus: Abdominal pruritus may be an early sign ofcholestasis. Ptyalism: Increase in saliva Bleeding gums and periodontal diseaseIncreased vascularity of the gums can result in gingivitis.distention stretches round ligaments causing spasm and pain. Diastasis recti: This is the separation of the rectus abdominis muscle in the midline caused by the abdomi-nal distention. It is a benign condition that can occur inthe third trimester. The impact of all of the musculoskeletal adaptations inpregnancy resulting in numerous common discomforts ofpregnancy can sometimes be reduced if the woman main-tains a normal body weight and exercises regularly priorto and throughout her pregnancy. Musculoskeletal System Significant adaptation occurs in the musculoskeletal system asa result of pregnancy (see Table 4-3). Hormonal shifts areresponsible for many of these changes. Mechanical factorsattributable to the growing uterus also contribute to muscu-loskeletal adaptation. Anatomical and physiological changes include: Altered posture and center of gravity related to distentionof the abdomen by the expanding uterus and reducedabdominal tone that shifts the center of gravity forward.A shift in the center of gravity places the woman at higherrisk for falls. Altered gait (\"pregnant waddle\"): Hormonal influences ofprogesterone and relaxin soften joints and increase jointmobility. Lordosis: Abnormal anterior curvature of the lumbar spine. The body compensates for the shift in center ofgravity by developing an increased curvature of the spine. Joint discomfort: Hormonal influences of progesteroneand relaxin soften cartilage and connective tissue, leadingto joint instability. Round ligament spasm: Estrogen and relaxin increaseelasticity and relaxation of ligaments, and abdominalIntegumentary System The integumentary system includes the skin and relatedstructures such as hair, nails, and glands. Hormonal influ-ences are primary factors in integumentary system adaptationsduring pregnancy, with mechanical factors associated with theenlarging uterus playing a lesser role in changes associatedwith this body system (see Table 4-3). Anatomical and physiological changes include: Hyperpigmentation: Estrogen and progesterone light to darkbrown pigmentation. Linea nigra: Darkened line in midline of abdomen (Fig. 4-7) Melasma (chloasma), also referred to as mask of pregnancy, is a brownish pigmentation of the skin over the cheeks, nose,and forehead. This occurs in 50%-70% of pregnant womenand is more common in darker skinned women. It usuallyoccurs after the 16th week of pregnancy and is exacerbatedby sun exposure. Striae (stretch marks): Stretching of skin due to growth of breast, hips, abdomen, and buttocks plus the effects ofestrogen, relaxin, and adrenocorticoids Vascularchanges related to hormonally induced increased elasticity ofvessels and increased venous pressure from enlarged uterus. Hot flashes and facial flushing: Caused by increasedblood supply to skin, increase in basal metabolic rate,progesterone-induced increased body temperature, andvasomotor instability. Oily skin and acne: Effects of increase in androgens. Sweating: Thermoregulation process at the level of skinincreased in response to increases in thyroid activity, basalmetabolic rate (BMR), metabolic activity of fetus, andincreased maternal body weight. Although none of these integumentary system adaptationsis seen universally, each alteration is seen commonly, isPATIENT EDUCATION (SEE TABLE 4-4) Discuss musculoskeletal system changes during pregnancy. Encourage good posture and body mechanics to preventsymptoms of pain. Teach symptom relief measures for back or ligament pain. Encourage gentle abdominal strengthening exercises. PATIENT EDUCATION (SEE TABLE 4-4) Reassure of normalcy and self-limiting nature of nausea andvomiting of pregnancy and suggest measures to prevent andrelieve. Advise the woman to maintain good oral hygiene and contin-ue routine preventative dental care. Encourage the woman to eat a high-fiber diet with adequatehydration and physical activity to prevent constipation andhemorrhoids.

Physiologic changes include: Significant alterations in pituitary, adrenal, thyroid, parathy-roid, and pancreatic functioning occur in pregnancy. Forexample, the hormonal production activity and size of thethyroid gland increase during pregnancy in support of mater-nal and fetal physiological needs, and there is an increase inpancreatic activity during pregnancy to meet both maternaland fetal needs related to carbohydrate metabolism.Pregnancy-specific hormones The hormones of pregnancy are responsible for most of the physiological adaptations and physical changes seenthroughout the entire pregnancy. The placental hormonesare initially produced by the corpus luteum of pregnancy.Once implantation occurs, the fertilized ovum and chorionic villi produce hCG. The function of the high hCG level in early pregnancy is to maintain the corpus luteum and its production of progesterone and, to a lesser extent, estrogen until the placenta develops and takes over this function. After the development of a functioning placenta, the placenta produces most of the hormones of pregnancy,including estrogen, progesterone, human placental lactogen (hPL), and relaxin. Each of these hormones plays a role in the physiology of pregnancy, resulting in specific alterations in nearly all body systems, as described in this chapter, to supportmaternal physiological needs, maintenance and progres-sion of the pregnancy, and fetal growth and development.(See Table 4-3 for details on pregnancy hormones.) Immune System Every aspect of the body's very complicated immune systemundergoes adaptation during pregnancy in order to maintaina tenuous balance between preservation of maternal-fetalwell-being through normal immune responses on the onehand, and the necessary alterations of the maternal immunesystem required for maintenance of the pregnancy on the other.This adaptive process involves the maternal immune systembecoming tolerant of the \"foreign\" fetal system so that the fetusis not rejected and, further, so that the fetus is protected frominfection. Immune function changes in pregnancy are far-reaching and beyond the scope of this chapter. This is also arelatively new body of science that is not fully understood. ANTEPARTAL NURSING CARE: PHYSIOLOGY-BASED NURSING ASSESSMENT AND NURSING ACTIONS Prenatal Assessment The prenatal period is the entire time period during which a woman is pregnant through the birth of the baby. It is a timeof transition in the life of a family as they prepare for the birth B Figure 4-7 Pregnant abdomen with striae ( A) B). system adaptations are essential for maintaining thestability of both the woman and her pregnancy and for pro-moting fetal growth and development. Endocrine glandsmediate the many metabolic process adaptations in pregnancy.PATIENT EDUCATION (SEE TABLE 4-4) Offer reassurance as skin pigmentation and/or otherchanges occur. Discuss normalcy of striae in pregnancy and encourage goodweight control. Suggest maintaining skin comfort with daily bathing, lotions,oatmeal baths, non-binding clothing. Advise to limit sun exposure and wear sunscreen.3704_Ch04_045-086 16/09/13 10:05 AM Page 68CHAPTER 4 Physiological Aspects of Antepartum Care 69 of a child. This time period affords an opportunity for positivechange in all aspects of health and health maintenance behav-iors. During ongoing interactions, the nurse places emphasison health education and health promotion involving thewoman in her care. The holistic view of health inherent innursing care for the childbearing woman and her family con-tributes to a unique situation in which the antepartal patienthas ready access to health information, support, and guidanceto help her achieve the healthiest possible pregnancy and thebest possible outcome for mothers and babies (Barron, 2014).The impact of this prenatal care (health care related to preg- nancy) and the possibility for positive change it engenders canextend well beyond the antepartal period into the life of thenew family. Prenatal nursing care and interventions also con-tribute to the woman's and family's ability to make informedchoices about the health care of the entire family throughoutthe childbearing cycle, choices based on an integration ofinformation provided by the nurse with the family's personalvalues, preferences, and beliefs. One of the Healthy People2020 Objectives is to increase by nearly 10% the proportion ofwomen who receive early and adequate prenatal care from70%-78% (United States Department of Health and HumanServices, 2010). Family-centered maternity care is a modelof obstetrical care based on a view of pregnancy and childbirthas a normal life event, a life transition that is not primarilymedical but rather developmental.The initial prenatal visit parallels a preconception healthcare visit (see Table 4-1). It also includes informationabout the health and health history of the father of thebaby (age, blood type and Rh status, current health statusand history of any chronic or past medical problems,genetic history, occupation, lifestyle factors impactinghealth, and his involvement in the woman's life and withher pregnancy). The focus of patient education and anticipatory guidanceshifts toward pregnancy-related health concerns, but thebasic components of the visit as well as the emphasis onhealth maintenance and health promotion remain thesame. Prenatal visits also include specific assessment ofthe pregnancy and fetal status. Some of these compo-nents are uniform across all prenatal visits, and others arespecific to one or more trimesters of the pregnancy. Subsequent prenatal visits are more abbreviated than theinitial visit, with nursing care and interventions focusedon current pregnancy status and patient needs, alwayswith an emphasis on patient education and anticipatoryguidance (see Table 4-5 and Clinical Pathway). The standard accepted frequency of prenatal care visits ina low-risk population in the United States results inapproximately 14-16 prenatal visits per pregnancy.However, available evidence suggests that a schedule withreduced frequency of prenatal visits for this population isnot associated with an increase in adverse maternal orperinatal outcomes and may be associated with increasedlevels of patient satisfaction. In spite of this evidence, theroutine remains unchanged for the present (Villar,Carrolli, Khan-Neelofer, Piaggio, & Gulmezoglo, 2007;Walker, McCully, & Vest, 2001).The efficacy of the current model for individual prenatalcare visits has been questioned as well (see Evidence-Based Practice: Centering Pregnancy). Evidence-Based Practice: Centering Pregnancy The generally accepted model of individual prenatal care cur-rently in use in the United States lacks a scientific basis; there isalso some question as to its effectiveness in meeting publichealth objectives in care provision to a healthy population(Walker & Rising, 2004). A group model of prenatal care deliv-ery, Centering Pregnancy, is designed to promote individualresponsibility for health in pregnancy; provide appropriate pre-natal assessment and risk screening; and provide education,social support, and a sense of community, all in a cost-effectiveand efficient manner. In one early pilot study, perinatal out-comes were comparable to the traditional care control group,and women reported satisfaction with their care, with 96% ofthe Centering Pregnancy participants preferring this alternativemodel to a traditional model of prenatal care (Rising, 1998).Subsequent research has shown positive benefits, includinghigher birth weights in a low socioeconomic status population(Ickovics et al., 2003); fewer missed prenatal appointments,preterm births, and low birth weight babies, and increasedrates of breastfeeding in an adolescent population (Grady &Bloom, 2004); and increased knowledge about pregnancy inthe Centering Pregnancy group compared to the traditionalcare group (Baldwin, 2006). Essential elements of the Centering Pregnancy model of group prenatal care include: 1.Health Assessment occurs within the group space. 2.Participants are involved in self-care activities. 3.A facilitated leadership style is used. 4.Each session has an overall plan. 5.Attention is given to general content outline. 6.There is stability of group leadership. 7.Group conduct honors the contribution of each member. 8.The group is conducted in a circle. 9.Opportunity for socializing is provided. 10.The composition of the group is stable, not rigid (Rotundo , 2011). Advantages of the Centering Pregnancy model of care include: focus on the normalcy of pregnancy, increased timewith the care provider during the pregnancy, a perceived benefitfor both the care provider and the pregnant woman, efficiencyfor the care provider in providing important prenatal educationcontent, development of social connections between groupmembers, social support for participants in managing the nor-mal challenges of pregnancy, and validation of the woman'sexperience of pregnancy by a peer group (Rotundo, 2011).Benefits of group prenatal care include: Improved birth outcomes Improved patient satisfaction Improved patient knowledge and readiness for labor andinfant care Higher breastfeeding initiation rates Improvement in racial disparities with regard to maternaloutcomes No increase in antenatal service costs Sources: Baldwin, 2006; Grady & Bloom, et al., AM 69UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 70 TABLE 4-5 PRENATAL CARE: CONTENT AND TIMING OF ROUTINE PRENATAL VISITS LABORATORY/DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES IN NORMAL HISTORY AND PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT PREGNANCY (RECOMMENDED TIMING) First Trimester Initial visit Return visit (4 weeks after initial visit) Second Trimester Return visits (Ever y 4 weeks)Comprehensive health and risk assess- ment (see Table 4-1) Current pregnancy historyComplete physical and pelvic examinationDetermine EDDNutrition assessment including 24-hour diet recall Psychosocial assessment (see Chapter 5)Assessment for intimate partner violence Chart reviewInterval historyFocused physical assessment: Vital signs, urine, reviewInterval historyNutrition follow-upFocused physical albumin,ketones, weight, fundal height, FHR,fetal movement, Leopold maneuver,edema Pelvic exam or sterile vaginal examination if indicated Confirm established due date.\u0081Blood type and Rh factor screening based on: \u0081Family history \u0081Racial/ethnic background (e.g., sickle \u0081Rubella titer 70CHAPTER 4 Physiological Aspects of Antepartum Care 71 TABLE 4-5 PRENATAL CARE: CONTENT AND TIMING OF ROUTINE PRENATAL VISITS\u2014cont'd LABORATORY/DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES IN NORMAL HISTORY AND PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT PREGNANCY (RECOMMENDED TIMING) Third Trimester RETURN VISITS (Ever y 2 weeks until 36 weeks, then weekly until 40 weeks; typically twice weekly af ter 40 weeks)Chart reviewInterval historyNutrition physical albumin,ketones, weight, fundal height, FHR,fetal movement (i.e., kick counts),Leopold maneuver, edema Pelvic exam or sterile vaginal examination if indicated Goals of Prenatal Care Maintenance of maternal fetal health Accurate determination of gestational age Ongoing assessment of risk status and implementation of risk-appropriate intervention Build rapport with the childbearing family Referrals to appropriate resources Nursing Actions Provide for comfort and privacy. Use therapeutic communication techniques during theinterview and conversation. Demonstrate sensitivity toward the patient related to the personal nature of the interview and conversation. Obtain the woman's identifying information (initial prenatal visit). Obtain a complete health history (initial prenatal visit) or an interval history (subsequent visits) (see Tables 4-1and 4-4 and Clinical Pathway). Conduct a Review of Systems (initial prenatal visit). Obtain blood pressure, temperature, pulse, respirations,weight, height (initial prenatal visit), and BMI (initialprenatal visit). Assess urine specimen for protein, glucose, and ketones. Assess for absence or presence of edema. Provide anticipatory guidance for the patient before andduring the physical examination (initial prenatal visit andsubsequent visits when indicated).Assist with physical and pelvic examination as needed (initial prenatal visit and subsequent visits when indicated). Assist with obtaining specimens for laboratory or diagnos-tic studies as ordered (initial prenatal visit and subsequentvisits when indicated). Provide teaching about procedures as needed (initial prenatal visit and subsequent visits when indicated). Provide anticipatory guidance related to the plan of careand appropriate follow-up, including how and when tocontact care provider with warning signs or symptoms(see Critical Components). Provide teaching appropriate for the woman, her family,and her gestational age. Assess the woman's understanding of the teaching provided. Allow time for the woman to ask questions. Document, according to agency protocol, all findings,interventions, and education provided. Assess for intimate partner violence (see CriticalComponent: Intimate Partner Violence). First Trimester It is best to begin prenatal care in the first trimester. Currentreports from the National Center for Health Statistics indi-cate that 70.8% of women who gave birth began prenatal carewithin the first 3 months of pregnancy, but 7.1% of allwomen received late (care beginning in the third trimester ofpregnancy) or no care (Martin, Hamilton, Sutton, Ventura,Mathews, Kimeyer, & Osterman, 2010). The percentage ofwomen with timely prenatal care declined (down 2%), andGroup B Streptococcus screening: Vaginal and rectal swab cultures done at 35-37 weeks' gestation to determinepresence of GBS bacterial colonization before the onsetof labor in order to anticipate intrapartum antibiotictreatment needs (CDC, 2010) Additional screening testing:\u0081H&H if not done in second trimester \u0081Repeat GC, Chlamydia, RPR, HIV , HbSAg (if indicat ed and not done in late second trimester) \u00811-hour glucose challenge test 24-28 weeks3704_Ch04_045-086 16/09/13 10:05 AM Page 71UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 72 the percentage of women with late or no care increased (up 6%) (Martin et al., 2010). Additionally, current govern-ment statistics reflect a decrease in timely prenatal care andincrease in late or no prenatal care in the United States, and disparities exist among ethnic groups (i.e., Hispanics and African Americans being less timely in accessing care as compared to Euro Americans). Specifically, non-Hispanicwhite women (76.2%) were markedly more likely than non-Hispanic black (59.2%) and Hispanic (64.7%) mothers tobegin care in the first trimester of pregnancy. During the initial prenatal visit, the woman learns the fre- quency of follow-up visits and what to expect from her prena-tal visits as the pregnancy progresses (see Table 4-5 and clin-ical pathway). If the patient is seen for her initial prenatal visitearly in the first trimester, she may have more than one visitduring that trimester. Subsequent visits are similar to thosedescribed for the second trimester. If the woman presents latefor prenatal care and is in her second or third trimester at herinitial prenatal visit, the nurse may need to modify typicalpatient education content to meet the current needs of thepatient and her family. At every prenatal care encounter, it is imperative that the nurse provides a relaxed environment for the woman and herfamily, one in which the childbearing family feels comfortableCRITICAL COMPONENT all pregnant women. AWHONN advocates for universal screen-ing for domestic violence for all pregnant women and recom-mends the ABCs of patient care to guide nurses caring for victimsof abuse (AWHONN, 2007). Learn and practice the ABCs of patient care: A:Alone. Reassure the woman that she is not alone, that therehave been others in her position before, and that help isavailable. B:Belief. Articulate your belief in the victim\u2014that you know theabuse is not her fault and that no one deserves to be hurt ormistreated. C:Confidentiality. Ensure the confidentiality of the informationthat is being provided and explain the implication of manda-tory reporting laws, where applicable. D:Documentation. Descriptive documentation with photo-graphs, taken with the woman's permission, and a verbatimaccount from the patient's perspective is helpful to accuratelycapture and record the nature and extent of injuries. E:Education. Education about community resources can be life-saving. Know where you can refer a woman for help and haveinformation about local shelters readily available. Also ask ifshe knows how to obtain a restraining order. S:Safety. One of the most dangerous times for women is thepoint at which they decide to leave. Tell the woman to call911 if she is in imminent danger and to consider alertingneighbors to call the police if they hear and/or see signs ofconflict.Intimate Partner Violence (Abuse) Intimate partner violence (IPV) against women consists ofactual or threatened physical or sexual violence and psycholog-ical and emotional abuse. IVP crosses all ethnic, racial, reli-gious, ethnic, and socioeconomic levels. Pregnancy does notprotect women from abuse. Homicide is the most likely causeof death in pregnant or recently pregnant women, and a significant portion of those homicides are committed by their intimate partners (Association of Women's Health,Obstetrics and Neonatal Nursing [AWHONN], 2007). Basedon the Abuse Assessment Screen, 16% or one in six pregnantwomen reported physical or sexual abuse during pregnancy(McFarlane, Parker, & Moran, 2007), seriously impactingmaternal and fetal health and infant birth weight. Men whoabuse pregnant women jeopardize the safety of the womanand infant. Pregnancy is often the only time a woman maycome into frequent contact with a health provider. Researchhas documented that three simple screening tools can reliablyidentify abused women. Those questions are:Within the last year have you been hit, slapped, kicked, or otherwise phys- ically hurt by someone? Since you have been pregnant have you been hit, slapped, kicked, or other- wise physically hurt by someone? Within the last year, has anyone forced you to have sexual activities? Assessment for abuse during pregnancy with education, advo- cacy, and referral to community resources should be standard for (AWHONN, 2007; Campbell & Furniss, 2002; McFarlane, Parker, & Moran, 2007) asking questions and sharing personal details about their livesrelated to the health of the woman, her fetus, and the devel-oping family. Components of Initial Prenatal Assessment (seeTable 4-5 and Clinical Pathway) History of current pregnancy: First day of last normal menstrual period (LNMP) anddegree of certainty about the date Regularity, frequency, and length of menstrual cycles Recent use or cessation of contraception Woman's knowledge of conception date Signs and symptoms of pregnancy Whether the pregnancy was intended The woman's response to being pregnant Obstetrical history, detail about all previous pregnancies:TPAL Whether abortions, if any, were spontaneous or induced Dates of pregnancies Length of gestation Type of birth experiences (e.g., induced or spontaneouslabors, vaginal or cesarean births, use of forceps or vacuum-assist, type of pain management) Complications with pregnancy, or labor and birth3704_Ch04_045-086 16/09/13 10:05 AM Page 72CHAPTER 4 Physiological Aspects of Antepartum Care 73 Neonatal outcomes including Apgar scores, birth weight,neonatal complications, feeding method, health and devel-opment since birth Pregnancy loss and assess grieving status Physical and pelvic examinations:The bimanual component of the pelvic examinationenables the examiner to palpate internally the dimen-sions of the enlarging uterus. This information assistswith dating the pregnancy, either confirming an LMP-based EDD or providing information in the absence of a certain LMP. In the absence of a certain LMP orwith conflicting data about gestational age, a decisionmay be made to perform an ultrasound examination ofthe pregnancy in order to determine an EDD. It isimportant to determine an accurate EDD as early aspossible in a pregnancy because numerous decisions related to timing of interventions and management ofpregnancy are based on gestational age as determined by the EDD. Clinical pelvimetry (measurement of the dimensions of thebony pelvis through palpation during an internal pelvicexamination) may be performed during the initial pelvicexamination. Its purpose is to identify any variations inpelvic structure that might inhibit or preclude a fetuspassing through the bony pelvis during a vaginal birth. Assessment of uterine growth:Uterine growth after 10-12 weeks' gestation is assessedby measuring the height of the fundus with the use of acentimeter measuring tape. The zero point of the tape isplaced on the symphysis pubis and the tape is thenextended to the top of the fundus. The measurementshould approximately equal the number of weeks preg-nant. Instruct the woman to empty her bladder before themeasurement because a full bladder can displace theuterus (Fig. 4-8). Maternal position and examiner uniformity are variablesthat render this evaluation somewhat imprecise, but it isuseful as a gross measure of progressive fetal growth as wellas to help identify a pregnancy that is growing outside theoptimal or normal range, either too large or too small forits gestational age. This serves as a screening tool for fetalgrowth. Assessment of fetal heart tones:Fetal heart tones are auscultated with an ultrasoundDoppler in the first trimester, initially heard by 10 and 12 weeks' gestation. The normal fetal heart rate (FHR)baseline is between 110 bpm to 160 bpm. Comprehensive laboratory and diagnostic studies:Laboratory studies are ordered or obtained at the initialprenatal visit to establish baseline values for follow-upand comparison as the pregnancy progresses (see Table 4-5and clinical pathway). Ultrasound might be performed during the first trimesterto confirm intrauterine pregnancy, viability, and gesta-tional age. CRITICAL COMPONENT Warning/Danger Signs of the First Trimester Abdominal cramping or pain indicates possible threatenedabortion, UTI, appendicitis. Vaginal spotting or bleeding indicate possible threatenedabortion. Absence of fetal heart tone indicates possible missed abortion. Dysuria, frequency, urgency indicate possible UTI. Fever, chills indicate possible infection. Prolonged nausea and vomiting indicate possible hypereme-sis gravidarum; increased risk of dehydration.PATIENT EDUCATION General information about physical changes (see Table 4-3) General information about common discomforts of pregnancy Relief measures for normal discomforts in early pregnancyare discussed based on patient need (Table 4-4) General information about fetal development: By the end ofthe first trimester the fetus is 3 inches in length and weighs 1 to 2 ounces, all organ systems are present, the head islarge, and the heartbeat is audible with Doppler. General health maintenance/health promotion information: Avoid exposure to tobacco, alcohol, and recreational drugs. Avoid exposure to environment hazards with teratogenic effects. Obtain input from the care provider before using medications,complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), and nutritionalsupplements. Reinforce safety behaviors (e.g., seat belt, sunscreen). Recognize the need for additional rest. Maintain daily hygiene. Decrease the risk for urinary tract infections (UTI) and vaginalinfections by wiping from front to back, wearing cotton underwear,maintaining adequate hydration, voiding after intercourse, and notdouching. Maintain good oral hygiene: Gentle brushing of teeth and flossing;continue routine preventative dental care. Exercise 30 minutes each day: Avoid risk for trauma toabdomen, avoid overheating, and maintain adequate hydrationwhile exercising. Establish daily Kegel exercises routine to maintain pelvic floor mus-cle strength and decrease risk of urinary incontinence and uterineprolapse. Travel is safe in low-risk pregnancy: Need to stop more frequently tostretch and walk to decrease risk of thrombophlebitis; take copy ofprenatal record. Use coping strategies for stress such as relaxation and meditation. Communicate with partner regarding changes in sexual responses:Sexual responses/desires change throughout pregnancy. Couplesneed to talk openly about these changes and explore different sexualpositions that accommodate the changes of pregnancy. Warning/danger signs that need to be reported to the careprovider (see Critical Component: Warning/Danger Signs AM Page 73UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 74 Nutritional Assessment and Education Nutrition should be discussed at all prenatal visits to reinforcethe importance of appropriate weight gain as both excessiveand inadequate weight gain in pregnancy are associated withpoor perinatal outcomes.Discuss appetite, cravings, or food aversions. Obtain a 24-hour diet recall and review for obvious deficiencies. Based on the woman's pre-pregnancy BMI and IOMguidelines (Boxes 4-1 and 4-3): Assist the woman to set weight gain goals with a recom-mended weight gain of between 1 to 5 pounds during thefirst trimester. Discuss distribution of weight gain during pregnancy (Box 4-4). Encourage the woman to eat a variety of unprocessed foodsfrom all food groups, including fresh fruits, vegetables,whole grains, lean meats or beans, and low-fat dairyproducts. For more detailed information on nutritional needs duringpregnancy, or to design a personalized daily food plan tailored to personal life circumstances, refer her towww.choosemyplate.gov/mypyramidmoms MyPyramid For Moms (Fig. 4-9) outlines the recom-mended daily food group amounts for each trimester. Encourage the woman to drink 8-10 glasses of fluid perday and limit caffeine to 200 mg per day. Certain types of fish (king mackerel, shark, swordfish,and tilefish) should be avoided due to high levels ofmethylmercury; however, most other fish and seafood aresafe as long as fully cooked. Advise on prevention of food borne illnesses:Wash hands frequently. Figure 4-8 Fundal height measurement during prenatal visit.BOX 4-3 NEW RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TOTAL AND RATE OF WEIGHT GAIN DURINGPREGNANCY, BY PRE-PREGNANCY BMI The impact of pre-pregnancy weight and gestational weight gainon perinatal outcomes is significant and is directly related toinfant birth weight, morbidity, and mortality. The current evi-dence suggests that inadequate weight gain and/or an under-weight pre-pregnancy weight increase risk for poor fetal growthand low birth weight. At the other end of the spectrum, excessiveweight gain and/or an overweight or obese pre-pregnancy weightincrease the risk for poor maternal and neonatal outcomes andmay have far-reaching implications for long-term health anddevelopment of chronic disease. Pre-pregnancy weight and BMIas well as gestational weight gain have increased nationally.

Ultrasound around 20 weeks' gestation to confirm EDDand scan fetal anatomy Laboratory and diagnostic studies:Triple screen or quad screen blood tests at 15-20 weeks'gestation 6): Screening for 21are not diagnostic. Amniocentesis is recom-mended if screening tests are positive. Screening for gestational diabetes: 1-hour glucose challengetest recommended between 24 and 28 weeks. 3-hour glucosetolerance test (GTT) is ordered if 1-hour screen is elevated. Hemoglobin and hematocrit between 28 and 32 weeks toidentify anemia and the need for iron supplement. This isthe time in pregnancy when the hemoglobin and hemat-ocrit are likely to be at their lowest, so the result providesthe care provider with valuable information for manage-ment of late pregnancy. Syphilis serology if prevalent or as indicated Antibody screen for Rh-negative women Administer RhoGAM to Rh-negative women with nega-tive antibody screen results.RhoGAM is administered at 28 weeks' gestation to helpprevent isoimmunization and the resulting risk ofhemolytic disease in fetuses in subsequent pregnancies (seeMedication: Rho (D) Immune Globulin (RhoGAM)). Figure 4-10 A nurse-practitioner listening to fetal heart tone with a pregnant mom and her toddler.Medication Rho (D) Immune Globulin (RhoGAM) Indication: Administered to Rh-negative women prophylac-tically at 28 weeks' gestation to prevent isoimmunizationfrom potential exposure to Rh-positive fetal blood duringthe normal course of pregnancy. Also administered withlikely exposure to Rh-positive blood, such as with pregnancyloss, amniocentesis, or abdominal trauma. Specic mechanism of action: Prevents production of anti-Rho (D) antibodies in Rho (D) negative women exposed toRho (D) positive blood. Prevention of antibody responseand hemolytic diseases of the newborn (erythroblastosisfe-talis) in future pregnancies of women who have conceivedan Rho (D)-positive fetus.

Components of Third Trimester Assessments Chart review Interval history Focused assessment (e.g., fundal height) Assessment of fetal well-beingAuscultation of FHR Record woman's assessment of \"kick counts\" Daily fetal movement count (kick counts) is a maternal assessment of f etal movement by counting fetal move- ments in a period of time to identify potentially hypoxicfetuses. Maternal perception of fetal movement wasone of the earliest tests of fetal well-being and remainsan essential assessment of fetal health. The pregnantwoman is instructed to palpate the abdomen and trackfetal movements daily by tracking fetal movements for 1 or 2 hours. In the 2-hour approach recommended by ACOG,maternal perception of at least 10 distinct f etal move- ments within 2 hours is considered reassuring; oncemovement is achieved, counts can be discontinued forthe day. In the 1-hour approach, the count is considered reas-suring if it equals or e xceeds the est ablished baseline; in general 4 movements in 1 hour is reassuring. Define fetal movements or kick counts to include: kicks,flutters, swishes, or rolls. Instruct mother to keep journal or documentation of the time it takes to feel fetal movement. Instruct mother to perform counts at same time every day. Instruct mother to monitor time intervals it takes and tocontact HCP immediately for deviations from normal(e.g., no movements or decreased movements). Decreased fetal activity should be reported to theprovider as fur ther evaluation of the fetus, such as a non-stress test or biophysical profile, is indicated. Pelvic examination to identify cervical change, depend-ing on weeks of gest ation and mat ernal symptoms Leopold's maneuvers to identify the position of the fetusin utero (Chapter 8) Screening for Group B Streptococcus (GBS)A quarter to a third of all women are colonized with GBSin the lower gastrointestinal or urogenital tract (typicallyasymptomatic). GBS infection in a newborn, either early-onset (first weekof life) or late-onset (after first week of life), can be inva-sive and severe, with potential long-term neurologicalsequella. Vaginal and rectal swab cultures are done at 35-37 weeks' gestation to determine presence of GBS bacterial colonization before the onset of labor in order to anticipate intrapartum antibiotic treatment needs(CDC, 2010).CRITICAL COMPONENT Warning/Danger Signs of the Second Trimester Abdominal or pelvic pain indicates possible PTL, UTI,pyelonephritis, or appendicitis. Absence of fetal movement once the woman is feeling dailymovement indicates possible fetal distress or death. Prolonged nausea and vomiting indicates possible hyper-emesis gravidarum; at risk for dehydration. Fever and chills indicates possible infection. Dysuria, frequency, and urgency indicate possible UTI. Vaginal bleeding indicates possible infection, friable cervix due to pregnancy changes, placenta previa, abruptio placenta, or PTL. Third Trimester The focused assessment includes all aspects of the secondtrimester assessment and may also include a pelvic examina-tion to identify cervical change, depending on weeks of gesta-tion and maternal symptoms.

Reinforce warning/danger signs that need to be reported tocare provider (see Critical Component: Warning/DangerSigns of the Third Trimester)Quality and Safety Education in Nursing(QSEN): Informatics Informatics is the use of information and technology tocommunicate, manage knowledge, mitigate error, and sup-port decision making. The Association of Women's Health,Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN) recognizes thevital role of informatics and health information technology(HIT) in health care delivery. AWHONN supports standarddata collection across the perinatal setting. Additionally,AWHONN recognizes the critical need for interoperabilityand archiving in data collection systems. Hospital- andinstitution-wide HIT systems should incorporate specialtyspecific data (e.g., obstetric outpatient records) intopatient records. To accomplish the efficient use of HIT inthe perinatal setting, nurses must be involved in the productselection, development, implementation, evaluation, andimprovement of information systems.

Margarite is a 28-year-old G3 P1 Hispanic womanhere for her rst prenatal care appointment. By her LMP she isat 8 weeks' gestation. Margarite reports some spotting 2 weeksago that prompted her to do a home pregnancy test that waspositive. The spotting has stopped. She tells you that she isvery tired throughout the day, has some nausea in the morningand breast tenderness. She is happy to be pregnant but a bitsurprised.Outline the aspects of your initial assessment.Outline for Margarite what laboratory tests are done during this first prenatal visit and rationale for the tests. Detail the prenatal education and anticipatory guidance appropriate to the first trimester of pregnancy. What teaching would you do for Margarite's discomforts of pregnancy? Discuss nursing diagnosis, nursing activities, and expected out- comes related to this woman. At 18 weeks' gestation Margarite comes to the clinic for a prenatal visit. She states she thinks she felt her baby movefor the first time last week and that the pregnancy now feels real to her. She states she feels \"Great! The nausea and fatigue are gone.\" She is concerned she is not eatingenough protein as she has little interest in red meat but eats beans and rice at dinner. She remembers discussing withyou at her first visit some screening tests for problems withthe baby but now is unsure how they are done and what theyare for.Outline for Margarite nutritional needs during pregnancy, high- lighting protein requirements. Outline for Margarite the screening tests that are done in the second trimester and what they are for. Detail the prenatal education and anticipatory guidance appropriate to the second trimester of pregnancy. Discuss nursing diagnosis, nursing activities, and expected out- comes related to this woman. Margarite comes to your clinic for a prenatal visit and is now at 34 weeks' gestation. She states she feels well but has someswelling in her legs at the end of the day, a backache at the endof the day, and difficulty getting comfortable to fall asleep. Sheis also having difficulty sleeping as she gets up to go to thebathroom two or three times a night. She remembers from her first pregnancy some things she should be aware of that indicate a problem at the end of preg-nancy but is not sure what they are.Detail the prenatal education and anticipatory guidance appropriate to the third trimester of pregnancy. What teaching would you do for Margarite's discomforts of pregnancy? What warning signs would you reinforce with Margarite at this point in her pregnancy? Discuss nursing diagnosis, nursing activities, and expected out- comes specific to Margarite.3704_Ch04_045-086 16/09/13 10:05 AM Page 80CHAPTER 4 Physiological Aspects of Antepartum Care 81 Review Questions 1.The appropriate recommended weight gain during preg-nancy for a woman with a normal BMI is: A. 10-15 lbs.

Less visible than the physical adaptationsof pregnancy, but just as profound, the pregnant woman'spsychological adaptations and development of her identity asa mother are crucial aspects of the childbearing cycle.Psychological, cultural, and social variables all significantlyinfluence this process. Psychosocial support for the pregnantwoman and her family is a distinct and major nursing respon-sibility during the antepartum period. This chapter presentsthe expected emotional changes a woman and her family mustnavigate to achieve a positive adaptation to pregnancy.Factors influencing these changes are also described. Successful adaptation to the maternal role requires important psychological work. Although becoming a motherhas been noted to occur on a long-term continuum, the psy-chological groundwork is laid during the course of eachwoman's individual experience during pregnancy. The preg-nant woman is able to use the 9 months available to her torestructure her psychological and cognitive self towardsmotherhood. Motherhood, an irrevocable change in awoman's life, progressively becomes part of a woman's totalidentity (Koniak-Griffin, Logsdon, Hines, & Turner, 2006;Mercer, 1995, 2004). Maternal Tasks of Pregnancy Maternal tasks of pregnancy were first identified in the psychoanalytic literature (Bibring, Dwyer, Huntington, &Valenstein, 1961), then further explored and outlined by classic maternity nurse researchers Reva Rubin, RamonaMercer, and Regina Lederman. Rubin's research has pro-vided a framework and core knowledge base from whichresearchers and clinicians have worked. Rubin identifiedsignificant maternal tasks women undergo during thecourse of pregnancy on their journey towards motherhood(1975, 1984).Ensuring a safe passage for herself and her child refers tothe mother's knowledge and care-seeking behaviors toensure that both she and the newborn emerge from preg-nancy healthy. Ensuring social acceptance of the child by significantothers refers to the woman engaging her social networkin the pregnancy. Attaching or \"binding-in\" to the child refers to the devel-opment of maternal-fetal attachment. Giving of oneself to the demands of being a motherrefers to the mother's willingness and efforts to makepersonal sacrifices for the child.Building on Rubin's work, Regina Lederman (1996, 2009) identified seven dimensions of maternal role development.These are:Accepting the pregnancyThis task focuses on the woman's adaptive responses to the changes that occur related to pregnancy growth and develop-ment (Lederman, 1996). These responses include: Responding to mood changes Responding to ambivalent feelings. Responding to nausea, fatigue, and other physical discom-forts of the early months of pregnancy. Responding to financial concerns Responding to increased dependency needs Expected findings:Desire and/or acceptance of pregnancy (see CriticalComponent: Ambivalent Feelings Toward Pregnancy) Predominately happy feelings during pregnancy Little physical discomfort or a high tolerance for the discomfort Acceptance of body changes Minimal ambivalent feelings and conflict regarding pregnancy by the end of her pregnancy A dislike of being pregnant but a feeling of love for theunborn child. CRITICAL COMPONENT Ambivalent Feelings Toward Pregnancy It is common for women to experience ambivalent feelingstoward pregnancy during the first trimester. These feelingsdecrease as pregnancy progresses. Ambivalence that continuesinto the third trimester may indicate unresolved conflict. Whenevaluating ambivalence it is important to assess: The reason for the ambivalence The intensity of the ambivalence Identification with the motherhood roleAccomplishment of this task is influenced by the woman's acceptance of pregnancy and the relationship thewoman has with her own mother. Women who have accep - ted their pregnancy and who have a positive relationshipwith their own mothers have an easier time accomplishingthis task (Lederman, 1996). Accomplishment of this task isalso influenced by the woman's degree of fears about laborrelated to helplessness, pain, loss of control, and loss of self-esteem (Lederman, 1996). Vivid dreams are common duringpregnancy, which allows the woman to envision herself as amother in various situations. A woman often rehearses orpictures herself in her new role in different scenarios (Rubin,1975). The motherhood role is progressively strengthenedas she attaches to the fetus. Events that facilitate fetalattachment:Hearing the fetal heartbeat Seeing the fetus move during an ultrasound examination Feeling the fetus kick or move Fetal attachment influences the woman's sense of herchild and her sense of being competent as a mother.3704_Ch05_087-114 16/09/13 10:08 AM Page 88CHAPTER 5 The Psycho-Social-Cultural Aspects of the Antepartum Period 89 Expected Findings:The woman:Moves from viewing herself as a woman-without-child toa woman-with-child Anticipates changes motherhood will bring to her life Seeks company of other pregnant women Is highly motivated to assume the motherhood role Actively prepares for the motherhood role Relationship to her motherA woman's relationship with her mother is an importantdeterminant of adaptation to motherhood. Unresolvedmother-daughter conflicts re-emerge and can confrontwomen during pregnancy (Lederman, 1996). Four components important to the woman's relationship with her own mother are: Availability of the woman's mother to her in the past andin the present The mother's reaction to her daughter's pregnancy The mother's relationship to her daughter The mother's willingness to reminisce with her daughterabout her own childbirth and child-rearing experiences Expected FindingsThe woman's mother was available to her in the past andcontinues to be available during the pregnancy (Fig. 5-1). The woman's mother accepts the pregnancy, respects herautonomy, and acknowledges her daughter becoming amother. The woman's mother relates to her daughter as an adultversus as a child.The woman's mother reminisces about her own childbear-ing and child-rearing experiences. Re-ordering relationships with her partnerPregnancy has a dramatic effect on a couple's relationship. Some couples view pregnancy and childbirth as a growth expe-rience and as an expression of deep commitment to their bond, while others view it as an added stressor to a relationshipalready in conflict. The partner's support during pregnancyenhances the woman's feelings of well-being and is associatedwith earlier and continuous prenatal care (Lederman, 1996,2009). Feeling loved and valued and having her child acceptedby her partner are two major contributors to positive adapta-tion (Cannella, 2006; Orr, 2004). Assessment of the relation-ship between the couple includes: The partner's concern for the woman's needs during pregnancy The woman's concerns for her partner's needs during pregnancy The varying desire for sexual activity among pregnantwomen The effect pregnancy has on the relationship (e.g., does itbeing them closer together or cause conflict?) The partner's adjustment to his or her new role. Expected FindingsThe partner is understanding and supportive of the woman. The partner is thoughtful and \"pampers\" the woman during pregnancy. The partner is involved in the pregnancy. The woman perceives that her partner is supportive. The woman is concerned about her partner's needs of making emotional adjustments to the pregnancy and newrole. Women in relationships with established open com-munication about sexuality are likely to have less difficultywith changes in sexual activity. Couples indicate that they are growing closer to each otherduring pregnancy. The partner is happy and excited about the pregnancy andprepares for the new role. Preparation for laborPreparation for labor means preparation for the physiologi- cal processes of labor as well as the psychological processes ofseparating from the fetus and becoming a mother to the child.Preparation for labor and birth occur by taking classes, reading,fantasizing, and dreaming about labor and birth (Lederman,1996, 2009). The degree of preparation for labor and birth hasan effect on the woman's level of anxiety and fear. The moreprepared a woman feels, the lower the level of anxiety and fear. Expected FindingsThe woman attends childbirth classes and reads booksabout labor and birth. The woman mentally rehearses (fantasizes) the labor andbirthing process. The woman has dreams about labor and birth. The woman develops realistic expectations of labor and birth. Figure 5-1 Pregnant woman and her mother participating in baby shower.3704_Ch05_087-114 16/09/13 10:08 AM Page 89UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 90 The pregnant woman may engage in a flurry of activityknown as \"nesting behavior,\" hurrying to finish preparingfor the newborn's arrival (Driscoll, 2008). Prenatal fear of loss of control in laborLoss of control includes two factors (Lederman 1996, 2009):Loss of control over the body Loss of control over emotions The degree of fear is related to:The woman's degree of trust with the medical and nursingstaff, her partner, and other support persons The woman's attitude regarding the use of medication andanesthesia for labor pain management Expected FindingsThe woman perceives individual attention from medical staff. The woman perceives that she is being treated as an adultand her questions and concerns are addressed by the medical staff. The woman perceives that the nursing staff is compassion-ate, understanding, and available. The woman perceives that she is being supported by herpartner and family/friends. The woman has realistic expectations regarding manage-ment of labor pain and these expectations are met. Prenatal fear of loss of self-esteem in labor Some women have fears that they will lose self-esteem in labor and \"fail\" during labor (Lederman, 2009). Whena woman feels a threat to her self-esteem, it is importantto assess the following areas (Lederman, 2009):The source of the threat The response to the threat The intensity of the reaction to the threat Behaviors that reflect self-esteem are:Tolerance of self Value of self and assertiveness Positive attitude regarding body image and appearance Expected FindingsAble to develop realistic expectations of self during laborand birth and an awareness of risks and potential complications Able to identify and respect her own feelings Able to assert herself in acquiring information needed tomake decisions Able to recognize her own needs and limitations Able to adjust to the unexpected and unknown Able to recover from threats quickly As the woman prepares to experience labor, give birth, and take on the maternal role, the process of maternal adaptationto pregnancy is completed. With the dominating physical dis-comforts of the third trimester, most women become impa-tient for labor to begin. There is relief and excitement aboutgoing into labor. The mother is ready and eager to deliver andhold her baby. She has prepared for her future as a mother(Rubin, 1984). Nursing Actions During the antepartal period, the nurse can take on a varietyof roles: teacher, counselor, clinician, resource person, rolemodel (see Critical Component: Nursing Actions ThatFacilitate Adaptation to Pregnancy).Nursing actions should be focused on health promotion,individualized care, and prevention of individual andfamily crises (Driscoll, 2008; Matson & Smith, 2004;Lederman, 2009). Factors That Influence Maternal Adaptation The ability of the woman to adapt to the maternal role isinfluenced by a variety of factors, including parity, maternalage, sexual orientation, single parenting, multiple gestation(twins, triples), socioeconomic factors, and abuse. Multiparity Multigravidas may have the benefit of experience, but itshould not be assumed that they need less help than afirst-time mother. They know more of what to expect interms of pain during labor, postpartum adaptation, andthe many added responsibilities of motherhood, but theymay need time to process and develop strategies for inte-grating a new member into the family. Pregnancy tasks may be more complex. Giving adequateattention to all of her children and supporting siblingadaptation are unique challenges faced by the multi-gravida. She may spend a great deal of time working outa new relationship with the first child, and grieve forthe loss of their special relationship. She also has toconsider the financial issues associated with feeding,clothing, and providing for another child while at thesame time maintaining a relationship with her partnerand continuing her career, whether inside or outside thehome (Jordan, 1989). Maternal Age Adolescent MothersAdolescents who have an unintended pregnancy face a number of challenges, including abandonment by their partners, increased adverse pregnancy outcomes, and inabil-ity to complete school education, which may ultimately limit their future social and economic opportunities (Ehiri, Meremikwu, & Meremikwu, 2005). The majordevelopmental task of adolescence is to form and becomecomfortable with a sense of self. Pregnancy presents a chal-lenge for teenagers who, as expectant parents, must copewith the conflicting developmental tasks of pregnancy andadolescence at the same time. Achieving a maternal identityis very difficult for an adolescent who is in the throes ofevolving her own identity as an adult capable of psychosocialindependence from her family. Although she may achieve3704_Ch05_087-114 16/09/13 10:08 AM Page 90CHAPTER 5 The Psycho-Social-Cultural Aspects of the Antepartum Period 91 CRITICAL COMPONENT may be more anxious about body changes in the secondtrimester. The woman may begin to have fears or phobias. Thenurse needs to acknowledge and validate the woman's feel-ings, and help the woman work towards resolving any conflict-ing feelings. Discuss normal changes in sexual activity and provide informa-tion and acknowledge the woman's sexuality. Encourage \"tuning in\" to fetal movements; discuss fetal capac-ities for hearing, responding to interaction, and maternal activ-ity. This will encourage the attachment process, and helpempower the woman with increased involvement in care. Reinforce to partner and family the importance of giving theexpectant mother extra support; give specific examples of waysto help (helping her eat well, helping with heavy work, givingextra attention). This will encourage family and partner partic-ipation in the pregnancy process and promote support for thewoman. A well-supported woman will likely have a more pos-itive adaptation to pregnancy. Third Trimester Encourage attendance at childbirth classes to promote knowl-edge and decrease fears. Discuss preparations for birth, parenthood; explore expecta-tions of labor. The woman will begin to focus more on theimpending birth during the third trimester, and her learningneeds will be more focused on this area. It is important to pro-vide anticipatory information and guidance. Assess partner's comfort level with labor coach role and reas-sure as needed; stress that help in labor will be available;encourage presence of second support person if appropriate.The woman's partner may not feel comfortable providinglabor support, and it is important to discuss prior to the onsetof labor so all roles can be claried. Refer to appropriate educational materials on parenthood.Encourage discussions of plans, expectations with partner.Give anticipatory guidance regarding the realities of infantcare, breastfeeding, and so on. This will promote communica-tion and planning with the expectant parents, as well as a pos-itive transition to parenthood. If psychosocial complications develop, plan for appropriatereferrals to coordinate with social workers, nutritionist, andcommunity agencies to ensure continuity of psychosocialassessment and provide appropriate support during thewoman's pregnancy. Help expectant mother identify and use support systems topromote positive adaptation to pregnancy, birth, and post-partum. To anticipate the need for postpartum support, anddecrease the risk of postpartum depression.Nursing Actions That Facilitate Adaptation toPregnancy First Trimester: Begin psychosocial assessment at initial contact; assess woman'sresponse to pregnancy; assess stressors in woman's life. It allowsthe nurse to determine whether there are issues that may requirereferrals, and to begin to develop the plan of care. Promote pregnancy and birth as a family experience; encouragefamily and father or partner participation in prenatal visits;encourage questions from father and family members about thepregnancy. It is important to offer an inclusive model of care thatacknowledges the needs of the family as well as the individual.Pregnancy signicantly affects all family members. Meeting withfamily members provides additional information to the nurse,and helps to complete the family assessment. Positive family support is associated with positive maternal adaptation. Assess learning needs. It allows the nurse to provide individu-alized information. Offer anticipatory guidance regarding normal developmentalstressors of pregnancy, such as ambivalence during early preg-nancy, feelings of vulnerability, mood changes, and activedream/fantasy life. It allows the nurse to emphasize normalcy,health, universality, strengths, and developmental concepts, todecrease anxiety. Assess for increased anxieties and fear; if anxieties seemgreater than normal, refer to psych care provider. Excessiveanxiety and stress, and prenatal depression have a negativeimpact on the course of a woman's pregnancy and also affectthe physiology of the developing fetus. Specialized interven-tion is needed. Listen, validate, provide reassurance, and teach expected emo-tional changes. Educate partner and family members, andstress normalcy of feelings to decrease anxiety and ensure thewoman feels \"heard\" and validated. If appropriate, discuss common phases through which expec-tant fathers progress through pregnancy. Be aware of phasesof paternal adaptation when counseling parents about expect-ed changes of pregnancy; provide anticipatory guidanceregarding potential communication conflicts. This willacknowledge the partner as a significant participant in thepregnancy process, and assist in improving communicationand decreasing stress in the relationship. Second Trimester: Encourage verbalization regarding possible grief process dur-ing pregnancy related to body image changes, loss of old life,changing relationships with family and friends. The woman (Driscoll, 2008; Lederman, 2009; Simpson & Creehan, 2008; Mattson & Smith, 2010) the maternal role, research indicates that she functions at alower level of competence than do older women (Mercer,2004). The younger she is, the more difficulty the adoles-cent woman has with body image changes, acknowledgingthe pregnancy, seeking health care, and planning for thechanges that pregnancy and parenting will bring. Delayedentry into prenatal care is common. There is also a higherrate of abuse among pregnant adolescents (Montgomery,2003; Porter, 2011). Successful adaptation to pregnancy andparenthood may greatly depend on the age of the adolescent(Fig. 5-2). Comprehensive and community-based health care pro-grams for adolescents have been shown to be effective in3704_Ch05_087-114 16/09/13 10:08 AM Page 91UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 92 improving outcomes for the teen mother and her infant.Examples include programs that have been implementedin schools, clinics, community agencies, or home visitationprograms. Additionally, higher levels of support andhigher self-esteem are associated with a more positiveadaptation to mothering for adolescents (Key Lair,2008; Porter & Holness, 2011). Early adolescence can be defined as the period between 11 and 15 years. Adolescents in this phase of life are self-centered and oriented towards the present. Additionally,there is a greater likelihood that pregnancy at this age is aresult of abuse or coercion. Moving into the maternal role isa difficult challenge for this age group. Grandmothers willplay a significant role in caring for the infant as well as providing guidance to their daughter regarding motheringskills. (Mercer, 1995; Montgomery 2003; Pinazo-Hernandis& Tompkins, 2009). Middle adolescence is defined as the period between 14 and16 years. During this time, the adolescent will be morecapable of abstract thinking and understanding conse-quences of current behaviors. By age 17-20, as adolescents mature into late adoles-cence, these skills will be further developed and eventually mastered. The older pregnant adolescent is more likely to be a capable and active participant in health care decisions (DeVito, 2010; Montgomery,2003).Older MothersIn North America, increasing numbers of women have delayed childbearing until after the age of 30-35. The majorityof women in this age group deliver at term without adverseoutcomes. However, even with good prenatal care, there is anincreased incidence of adverse perinatal outcomes. Chronicdiseases that are more common in women over 35 may affectthe pregnancy. Older mothers are also more likely to have mis-carriages, fetal chromosomal abnormalities, low birth weightinfants, premature births, and multiple births. In women over40, the risk increases for placenta previa, placenta abruptio,caesarean deliveries, and gestational diabetes. In fact, 49.5% ofbabies of women over the age of 40 are delivered by caesareansection (Bayrampour & Heaman, 2010; CDC, Liston, 2005). The moremature woman is better equipped psychosocially to assume the maternal role. However, she also might have increased difficulty with the changing roles in her life, experiencingheightened ambivalence. She might have difficulty balancing acareer with the physical and psychological demands of preg-nancy. The sometimes unpredictable nature of pregnancy,labor, and life with a newborn may challenge a woman whomay have developed a predictable life over which she has much control (Carolan, 2005; Dobrzykowski & Stern, 2003;Schardt, 2005). Older mothers are more commonly from ahigher socioeconomic background and have a greater numberof years of education. They are more likely to be established in a career, their relationships, and their lifestyles. Pregnancyis often chosen and planned. Sometimes it culminates afterinfertility treatments and may involve extensive use of repro-ductive technologies. Pregnant women in this age group arehighly motivated to seek information about childbirth andparenting from books, friends, and electronic resources. Lesbian Mothers Little research has been conducted on the process of maternaladaptation to pregnancy in lesbian women. Although thedevelopmental tasks of pregnancy are likely to be similar, thelesbian woman faces unique obstacles and challenges intoday's health care environment. Healthy People 2020 hasadded new objectives relating to improving the health, safety,and well-being of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender(LGBT) individuals (U.S. DHHS, 2010).Lesbian women may be more likely to lack social support,particularly from their families of origin. They may beexposed to additional stress due to homophobic attitudes,in particular in the health care system. Finding supportive health care providers with whom theyare comfortable disclosing sexual orientation is an impor-tant need identified by lesbian women (Fig. 5-3).Heteronormative health care environments in which par-ents are assumed to be a man and a woman present barriersto care for all same-sex couples. The role of the woman'spartner and legal considerations of the growing family willalso affect the lesbian experience of pregnancy (McManus,Hunter, & Renn, 2006; Rondahl, 2009; Ross, 2005). Figure 5-2 Pregnant adolescent. courtesy of Randi Willis and Gwen Ortiz.)3704_Ch05_087-114 16/09/13 10:08 AM Page 92CHAPTER 5 The Psycho-Social-Cultural Aspects of the Antepartum Period 93 Lesbian mothers most commonly plan their pregnancies,conceiving through donor insemination. In addition, ithas been observed that many lesbian couples participatein a relatively equal division of child care. These factorscan combine to help decrease the stress a lesbian mothermight experience and act as protection from perinataldepression (Ross, 2005). Nursing assessments of lesbian women should be adapt-ed accordingly. Nurse needs to strive toward the use ofinclusive language and avoid making assumptions abouta woman's gender orientation without further informa-tion. Birth partners who are not the biologic fathersexperience the same fears, questions, and concerns.Birth partners need to be kept informed, supported, and included in all activities in which the mother desires their participation. Single Parenting The literature reports a higher degree of stress for pregnantsingle women (e.g., greater anxiety; less tangible reliable sup-port from family and friends) (Logsdon, 2000; Simpson &Creehan, 2008).Single mothers may live at or below the poverty level, fac-ing greater financial challenges, resulting in a higher riskof depression. Single women engage in the maternal tasksof pregnancy and face more complex tasks and a variety ofchallenges. With the initial news, the decision must bemade whether or not to proceed with the pregnancy.Telling the family may cause concern.Issues regarding legal guardianship in the event she isincapacitated must be considered. Putting the father's name on the birth certificate is anotherdecision she must make. The reasons surrounding the pregnancy and the presenceor absence of strong support persons can significantlyinfluence her adaptation (Beeber & Canuso, 2005). Initialassessments are crucial for providing appropriate care:Is the woman single by choice? Is she a single mother by accident? (i.e., death of partnerfollowing conception, separation, divorce) Did she get pregnant by a casual acquaintance? Multigestational Pregnancy A multiple gestation pregnancy (twins, triples, etc.) placesadded psychosocial stressors on the family unit. The diagnosisshocks many expectant parents, and they may need additionalsupport and education to help them cope with the changesthey face. The increased risk for adverse outcomes results inincreased fears and anxieties for the pregnant woman.If the woman is found to be carrying more than threefetuses, the parents may receive counseling regardingselective reduction of the pregnancies to reduce the inci-dence of premature birth and allow the remaining fetusesto grow to term gestation.This situation poses an ethical dilemma and emotionalstrain for many parents, particularly if they have beenattempting to achieve pregnancy for Socioeconomic Factors The resources of the family to meet the needs for food, shelter,and health care play a crucial role in how a family responds topregnancy.Financial barriers have been identified as the one of themost important factors contributing to maternal inabilityto receive adequate prenatal care. Immigrant women face significant economic barriers.Women in this group are often marginalized, and manymay work in low-income service oriented jobs. Access tohealth care may be particularly limited (Driscoll, 2008;Jentsch, Durham, Hundley, & Hussein, 2007; Meleis,2003). The elimination of these health care disparities resultingfrom low income has been noted as one of the majorgoals of Healthy People 2020 (U.S. DHHS, 2010). The Abused Woman Pregnancy can often be a trigger for beginning or increasedabuse, or intimate partner violence (IPV) (see Chapters 4 and 7).Yet, pregnancy offers a unique opportunity for health careproviders to recognize abuse and to intervene appropriately.Screen all pregnant women for abuse. For further infor-mation on IPV, refer to Chapters 4 and 7.Figure 5-3 Lesbian pregnant couple. (Photo courtesy of Gwen Ortiz and Randi Willis.) 3704_Ch05_087-114 16/09/13 10:08 AM Page 93UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 94 Nursing Actions Assess adaptation to pregnancy at every prenatal visit. Earlyassessment and intervention may prevent or greatly reducelater problems for the pregnant woman and her family. Identify areas of concern, validate major issues, and makesuggestions for possible changes. Refer to the appropriate member of the health care team. Establish a trusting relationship, as women may be reluc-tant to share information until one has been formed (e.g.,questions asked at the first prenatal visit bear repeatingwith ongoing prenatal care). Use psychosocial health assessment screening tools.A variety of screening tools can be used to assess adaptationto pregnancy and to identify risk factors. Psychosocialassessment reported in the literature ranges from a fewquestions asked by the health care provider to question-naires and risk screening tools focusing on a specific areasuch as depression or abuse (Beck, 2002; Carroll et al.,2005; Midmer, Carroll, Bryanton, & Stewart, 2002;Priest, Austin, & Sullivan, 2006; Spietz & Kelly, 2003). The Antenatal Psychosocial Health Assessment (ALPHA)form, developed in Ontario, Canada, has been demon-strated to be a useful evidence-based prenatal tool thatcan identify women who would benefit from additionalsupport and intervention (Box 5-1) (Carroll et al.,2005; Midmer et al., 2002). PATERNAL ADAPTATION DURING PREGNANCY The news of a pregnancy has a profound effect on the man.Men have fears, questions, and concerns regarding the preg-nancy, his partner, and his transition to fatherhood. EachMilitary Deployment Military deployment can significantly influence adaptationto pregnancy. Thousands of women of childbearing age areserving and being deployed in the U.S. military. Womencurrently comprise more than 14% of active duty forces.Although women are excluded from serving in direct com-bat roles in the military, they serve in positions that putthem in the direct line of fire and may cause significantstress (e.g., convoy driver, patrol).For women veterans, pregnancy can exacerbate mentalhealth conditions (Mattocks et al., 2010) (see Evidence-Based Practice: Women in the Military). Since theVeterans Health Administration (VHA) does not pro-vide pregnancy care, pregnant veterans may also befaced with fragmentation between the VHA and non-VHA care providers, putting them at further risk forpoor outcomes. Women with deployed partners may also have more diffi-culty with accepting the pregnancy, and experience greaterconflict. There is evidence, however, that on-base com-munity support can have a positive effect on pregnancyacceptance for these women (Weis et al., 2008; Weis &Ryan, 2012). The Centering Pregnancy model of care, implemented atvarious military treatment facilities, also shows promisefor offering effective group support for military spouses(Foster, Alviar, Neumeier, & Wootten, 2012). Evidence-Based Practice: Women in the Military Mattocks, K., et al. (2010). Pregnancy and mental health among women veter-ans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Journal of Women's Health, 19 (12), 2166-2159. Little is known about mental health problems or treatmentamong pregnant women veterans. Veterans may experience sig-nificant stress during military service that can have lingeringeffects. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of mental health problems among veterans who received pregnan-cy related care in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA)system. Data was collected and analyzed from the Defense Manpower Data Center deployments roster of military dis-charges from October 2001 to April 2008, resulting in a cohortof 43,078 female veterans. Pregnancy and mental health condi-tions were quantified according to VHA codes. Results indicate that veterans with a pregnancy were twice as likely to have a diagnosis of depression, anxiety, post-trau-matic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia asthose without a pregnancy. Limitations of the study are that only women who received VHA care were included. Women veterans seeking care outsidethe VHA system were not included. Results point to the need for further study to understand the overlap between pregnancy and mental health conditions inVHA patients, and the impact of mental health treatment onpregnancy outcomes among women veteransBOX 5-1 ANTENATAL PSYCHOSOCIAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT (ALPHA) The Antenatal Psychosocial Health Assessment is an evidence-based prenatal tool that can help providers identify womenwho would benefit from additional support and intervention.This tool assesses the following areas:Social supportRecent stressful life eventsCouple's relationshipOnset of prenatal carePlans for prenatal educationFeelings toward pregnancy after 20 weeksRelationship with parents in childhoodSelf-esteemHistory or psychiatric/emotional problemsDepression useFamily violence (2005).3704_Ch05_087-114 16/09/13 10:08 AM Page 94CHAPTER 5 The Psycho-Social-Cultural Aspects of the Antepartum Period 95 man brings to pregnancy a unique history with which hebegins his own experience of becoming a father. Some menrelish the role and look forward to actively nurturing a child.Others may be more detached or even hostile to the idea offatherhood. Fathers' Participation Changing cultural and professional attitudes have encouragedfathers' participation in the birth experience.Some fathers respond well to this expectation, wishing toexplore every aspect of pregnancy, childbirth, and parent-ing (May, 1980). Others are more task oriented and view themselves asmanagers. They may direct the woman's diet and restperiods and act as coaches during childbirth but remaindetached from the emotional aspects of the experience. Some men are more comfortable as observers and prefernot to participate. In some cultures, men view pregnancy and childbirth asexclusively a woman's domain, and may be removed fromthe experience completely. In high-risk populations, increased paternal involvementcan be one way to potentially improve birth outcomesand reduce health care disparities. Fatherhood initiativesand employment assistance are examples of programs thatcan promote paternal involvement (Alio et al., 2010;Alio, Bond, Padilla, Heidelbaugh, Lu, & Parker, 2011;Misra, Caldwell, Young, & Abelson, 2010).Effect of Pregnancy on Fathers Concerns about the well-being of his partner are heightened,and worries may be present about whether he and his partnerwill be good parents.Increased emphasis on his role as provider causes areevaluation of lifestyle and job or career status.There may be anxiety about providing financial stabilityfor his growing family. Changes in relationships and roles will challenge expec-tant fathers, creating the potential for distancing fromtheir partners.There may be a higher risk for infidelities. With the focus of prenatal care on the woman and the growing fetus, the man may struggle at times tofeel that he is relevant in the pregnancy (Widarsson et al., 2012). Some fathers may find themselves without models toassist them in taking on the role of active and involvedparent (Genesoni & Tallandini, 2009; Hanson et al.,2009). Men may experience pregnancy-like symptoms and dis-comforts similar to those of their pregnant partner, suchas nausea, weight gain, or abdominal pains. This isreferred to as Couvade Syndrome (Brennan, 2007). Abuse may begin or escalate with the news of pregnancy. Paternal Developmental Tasks There is evidence that paternal adaptation involves uniquedevelopmental tasks for fathers (Table 5-1). May's classicresearch (1982) on men identified three phases that fathersexperience as the pregnancy progresses:The announcement phase The moratorium phase The focusing phaseThese experiences unfold concurrently but in a distinctly different manner than the pregnant woman's adaptive experience. Nursing Actions Explore the man's response to news of pregnancy. Reassure that ambivalence is common in the earlymonths of pregnancy. Reassure normalcy of pregnancy-like symptoms (CouvadeSyndrome). Encourage attendance in childbirth classes (i.e., provideresources for classes, discuss advantages of attendingclasses). Encourage the man to negotiate his role in labor with hispartner. Explore his attitudes and expectations of pregnancy,childbirth, and parenting (see Critical Component:Nursing Actions That Facilitate Adaptation toPregnancy).Patient-Centered Care Definition: Recognize the patient or designee as the sourceof control and full partner in providing compassionate andcoordinated care based on respect for patient's preferences,values, and needs. This chapter explores the influence of culture on values and beliefs, the effects of pregnancy on the woman as wellas on members of the immediate and extended family, and variables that influence the woman's adaptation topregnancy. We explore many topics related to patient and family empowerment, barriers to culturally competent care, andhow to remove those barriers. We describe how diverse cultural, ethnic, and social backgrounds function as sources of patient, family, andcommunity values. We explore patient-centered care with sensitivity and respect for the diversity of human experience. There is an emphasis on women's choices in choosing a provider and place of birth, and developing a birth plan. Nursing actions are focused on providing autonomy and choices based on the respect for the woman's preferences,values, and needs. Health promotion, individualized care,and a family-centered approach are all crucial componentsof nursing care.QSEN3704_Ch05_087-114 16/09/13 10:08 AM Page 95UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 96 Common concerns related to sexual activity include:Fears about hurting the fetus during intercourse or causingpermanent anomalies as a result of sexual activity. Fear the birth process will drastically change the woman'sgenitals. Changes in body shape and body image will influenceboth partners' desire for sexual expression. Nursing Actions Discuss fears and concerns related to sexual activity. Encourage communication between partners and discusspossible changes with couples.Encourage the couple to verbalize fears and to ask questions. Use humor and encourage the couple to use humor torelieve anxiety or embarrassment. Advise pregnant women that there are no contraindica-tions to intercourse or masturbation to orgasm providedthe woman's membranes are intact, there is no vaginalbleeding, and she has no current problems or history ofpremature labor (Crooks & Baur, 2010). Review sexual positions to increase comfort for couplewith advancing pregnancy. Discuss alternative forms of sexual expression. FAMILY ADAPTATION DURING PREGNANCY The family is a basic structural unit of the community and constitutes one of society's most important institutions. It is a key target for perinatal assessment and intervention.SEXUALITY IN PREGNANCY Sexuality in pregnancy occurs on a wide continuum of respons-es for women. Some women feel more beautiful and desirablewith advancing pregnancy and others unattractive and ungain-ly. The sexual relationship can be significantly affected duringpregnancy. Physical, emotional, and interactional factors allplay a part in the woman's and her partner's sexual responseduring pregnancy (Crooks & Baur, 2010).The desire for sexual activity varies among pregnantwomen. Sexual desire can vary even in the same womanat different times during the pregnancy.During the first trimester, fatigue, nausea, and breast tenderness may affect sexual desire. During the second trimester, there may be an increase indesire as a result of increased sense of well-being and thepelvic congestion associated with this time in pregnancy. During the third trimester, sexual interest may once againdecrease as the enlarging abdomen creates feelings of awk-wardness and bulkiness. Women in relationships with established open communi-cation about sexuality are less likely to have difficultywith changes in sexual activity. It may be necessary for a couple to modify intercoursepositions for the pregnant woman's comfort.The side-by-side, woman-above, and are generally more comfortable than the man-abovepositions. Nonsexual expression of affection is important as well.TABLE 5-1 PATERNAL ADAPTATION TO PREGNANCY ANNOUNCEMENT PHASEMen may react to the news of pregnancy with joy, distress, or a combination of emotions, depending on whether the pregnancy is planned or unwanted. MORATORIUM PHASEDuring this phase, many men appear to put conscious thought of the pregnancy aside for some time, even as their partners are undergoing dramatic physical and emotional changes right before their eyes. FOCUSING PHASEThe focusing phase begins in the last trimester.Men will be actively involved in the pregnancy and their relationship with the child. Source: May, 1982.Occurs as the news of the pregnancy is revealed.It may last from a few hours to several weeks.It is very common at this phase for men to feel ambivalence.The main developmental task is to accept the biologic fact of pregnancy.Men will begin to attempt to take on the expectant father role.This can cause potential conflict when women attempt to communicate with their partners about the pregnancy. Sexual adaptation will be necessary as well; men may fear hurting the fetus during intercourse. Feelings of rivalry may surface as the fetus grows larger and the woman becomes more preoccupied with her own thoughts of impending motherhood. Men's main developmental task during this phase is to accept the preg- nancy. This includes accepting the changing body and emotional stateof his partner, as well as accepting the reality of the fetus, especiallywhen fetal movement is felt. Men begin to think of themselves as fathers.Men participate in planning for labor and delivery, and the newborn.Men's main developmental task is to negotiate with their partner the role they are to play in labor and to prepare for parenthood.3704_Ch05_087-114 16/09/13 10:08 AM Page 96CHAPTER 5 The Psycho-Social-Cultural Aspects of the Antepartum Period 97 This primary social group assumes major responsibility forthe introduction and socialization of children, and forms apotent network of support for its members. An understand-ing of the different family structures and the life cycle of thefamily and the related developmental tasks can assist thenurse in the development of nursing care during pregnancy.The family has traditionally been defined as \"the funda-mental social group in society typically consisting of oneor two parents and their children\" (Friedman, Bowen, &Jones, 2003). The structure of families varies widely among and withincultures. Social scientists now commonly recognize thatfamilies exist in a variety of ways, and that during thecourse of their lives, children may indeed belong to sever-al different family groups. Changing Structures of the Family The U.S. census data indicates major shifts in the configura-tion of families over the past several decades. A woman'sfamily is the primary support during the childbearing yearsand has a direct influence on her emotional and physicalhealth. It is essential that the nurse identify the woman's def-inition of family and provide care on that basis. Nurses mustsupport all types of families (Fig. 5-4). The variety of familyconfigurations includes (Friedman, 2003):The nuclear family: a father, mother, and child livingtogether but apart from both sets of grandparents. The extended family: three generations, including mar-ried brothers and sisters and their families. Single parent family: divorced, never married, separated,or widowed man or woman and at least one child. Three generational families: any combination of first,second and third generation members living within ahousehold. Dyad family: couple living alone without children. Stepparent family: one or both spouses have beendivorced or widowed and have remarried into a familywith at least one child.Blended or reconstituted family: a combination of twofamilies with children from one or both families andsometimes children of the newly married couple. Cohabiting family: an unmarried couple living together. Gay or lesbian family: a homosexual couple living togeth-er with or without children; children may be adopted,from previous relationships, or conceived via artificialinsemination. Adoptive family: single persons or couples who have atleast one child who is not biologically related to them andto whom they have legally become parents.Family theorists have identified eight stages in the life cycle of a family that provide a framework for nurses caring for childbearing families (Duvall, 1985, Friedman, et al., 2003):Beginning families Childbearing families Families with preschool children Families with school-aged children Families with teenagers Families launching young adults Middle-aged parents Family in retirementEach of these stages has developmental tasks that the family needs to accomplish to successfully move to the next stage. Developmental Tasks The events of pregnancy and childbirth are considered adevelopmental (maturational) crisis in the life of a family,i.e., those changes associated with normal growth and development.All family members are significantly affected.Previous life patterns may be disturbed and there may be asense of disorganization. Certain developmental tasks have been identified which afamily must face and master to successfully incorporate anew member into the family unit and allow the family tobe ready for further growth and development. The devel-opmental tasks for the childbearing family are:Acquiring knowledge and plans for the specific needs ofpregnancy, childbirth, and early parenthood Preparing to provide for the physical care of the newborn Adapting financial patterns to meet increasing needs Realignment of tasks and responsibilities Adjusting patterns of sexual expression to accommodatepregnancy Expanding communication to meet emotional needs Reorienting of relationships with relatives Adapting relationships with friends and community totake account of the realities of pregnancy and the antici-pated newborn The accomplishment of these tasks during pregnancy lays the groundwork for later adaptation required when the new-born is added to the family unit (Duvall, 1985; Friedman, et al., 2003). Figure 5-4 Multicultural family.3704_Ch05_087-114 16/09/13 10:08 AM Page 97UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 98 Nursing Actions Assess knowledge related to pregnancy, childbirth, andearly parenting. Assess progress in developmental tasks of pregnancy. Explore patterns of communication related to emotionalneeds, responsibilities, and new roles. Include the entire family; assessments and interventionsmust be considered in a family-centered perspective. Provide education and guidance related to pregnancy,childbirth, and early parenting (see Critical Component:Nursing Actions That Facilitate Adaptation toPregnancy). GRANDPARENT ADAPTATION Grandparents are often the first family members to be toldabout the pregnancy. They must make complex adjust-ments to the news. When it is their first grandchild, mostgrandparents are delighted. A first pregnancy is also unde-niable evidence that they are growing older, and some mayrespond negatively, indicating that they are not ready to begrandparents.New parents recognize that the tie to the future representedby the fetus is of special significance to grandparents. Grandparents provide a unique sense of family historyto expectant parents that may not be available else-where. They can be a valuable resource and canstrengthen family systems by widening the circle of support and nurturance. Grandparents may also be called upon for more long-term help. Teen pregnancy, parents' incarceration, sub-stance abuse, child abuse, and death or mental illnessesof the parents are examples of situations where grand-parents may have to assume the care and upbringing ofthe newborn. The demands of helping to raise their grandchild maycreate added stressors in their lives that they may nothave anticipated. Community and home-based multigen-erational parent support interventions may address someof these concerns (Sadler & Clemmens, 2004; Pinazo-Hernandis, & Tompkins, 2009). Nursing Actions Assess the grandparents' response to pregnancy. Explore grandparents as a resource during pregnancy andearly parenting. SIBLING ADAPTATION Sharing the spotlight with a new brother or sister can be amajor crisis for a child. The older child often experiences asense of loss or feels jealous at being \"replaced\" by the newsibling. During pregnancy, areas of change that impact siblings the most involve maternal appearance, parentalbehavior, and changes in the home environment such assleeping arrangements.Sibling adaptation is greatly influenced by the child's ageand developmental level, and the attitude of the parents.Children under the age of 2 are usually unaware of thepregnancy and do not understand explanations about thefuture arrival of the newborn. Children from 2-4 years of age may respond to the obviouschanges in their mother's body but may not remember frommonth to month why the changes are occurring. This agegroup is particularly sensitive to the disruptions of thephysical environment. Therefore, if the parents plan tochange the sibling's sleeping arrangements to accommodatethe new baby, these arrangements should be implementedwell in advance of the birth. Children still sleeping in acrib should be moved to a bed at least 2 months before thebaby is due. Children ages 4-5 often enjoy listening to the fetal heart-beat and may show interest in the development of thefetus. As pregnancy progresses, they may resent the changesin their mother's body that interfere with her ability to liftand hold them, or engage in physical play. School-age children ages 6-12 are usually enthusiastic andkeenly interested in the details of pregnancy and birth.They have many questions and are eager to learn. Theyoften plan elaborate welcomes for the newborn and wantto be able to help when their new sibling comes home(Fortier, Carson, Will, & Shubkagel, 1991). Adolescent responses to pregnancy will vary according totheir developmental status. They may be uncomfortablewith the obvious evidence of their parents' sexuality orbe embarrassed by the changes in their mother's appear-ance. They may be fascinated and repelled by the birthprocess all at once. Older adolescents may be somewhatindifferent to the changes associated with pregnancy butalso may respond in a more adult fashion by offeringsupport and help. Expectant parents should make a special effort to pre-pare and include the older child as much as their devel-opmental age allows. Preparation must be carried out atthe child's level of understanding and readiness to learn(Box 5-2). Some children may express interest in being present atthe birth. If siblings are to attend the birth, they shouldparticipate in a class that prepares them for the event.During the labor and birth, a familiar person who has noother role should be available to explain what is takingplace and to comfort or remove them if the situationbecomes overwhelming. Nursing Actions Explore with parents strategies for sibling preparation(see Box 5-2). Assess adaptation to pregnancy at every prenatal visit. Earlyassessment and intervention may prevent or greatly reducelater problems for the pregnant woman and her family.3704_Ch05_087-114 16/09/13 10:08 AM Page 98CHAPTER 5 The Psycho-Social-Cultural Aspects of the Antepartum Period 99 Discuss strategies to facilitate sibling adaptation based onthe child's age and development. Facilitate discussion of the birth plan if parents want thechildren present during the sibling's birth. DIFFICULTIES WITH ADAPTATION TO PREGNANCY Women may present with psychosocial issues and concernsthat are beyond the realm of the perinatal nurse. Nurses needto be aware of community mental health resources and beprepared to collaborate with psychiatric or mental health spe-cialties, social services, or community agencies. Mental healthissues during pregnancy can create problems for the pregnantwoman across several dimensions.Difficulty with taking on the maternal role, making thenecessary transitions to parenthood, and mourning lossesassociated with that time before pregnancy are all poten-tial areas of concern. Prenatal depression, maternal stress, and anxiety all exertbiochemical influences that significantly impact thedeveloping fetus and contribute to adverse birth outcomesthat have long-term consequences (e.g., low birth weight,shorter gestational age, adverse neonatal behavioralresponses) (Lederman, 2009). When assessing mood, emotional states, and anxiety,the nurse should consider three aspects: frequency,duration, and intensity. If the woman is having difficulty functioning in her daily life and having difficulty coping, a referral is necessary (Simpson &Creehan, 2008; Lederman, 2009). Nursing Actions Assess adaptation to pregnancy at every prenatal visit.Early assessment and intervention may prevent orgreatly reduce later problems for the pregnant womanand her family. Assess the woman's mood, anxiety, and emotional state and consider three aspects: frequency, duration, and intensityof patients' emotional response. Assess the woman's support system and coping mechanism. Discuss expectations about pregnancy, childbirth, andparenting. Identify areas of concern, validate major issues, and makesuggestions for possible changes. Refer to the appropriate member of the health care team. Establish a trusting relationship, as women may be reluc-tant to share information until one has been formed (e.g.,questions asked at the first prenatal visit bear repeatingwith ongoing prenatal care). Make appropriate referrals to other health professionalswhen needed. PSYCHOSOCIAL ADAPTATION TO PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS The majority of the time, pregnancy progresses with fewproblems and results in generally positive outcomes.However, with the diagnosis of pregnancy complications,normal concerns and anxieties of pregnancy are exacerbatedeven more. Uncertainty of fetal outcome can interfere withparental attachment.Response to pregnancy complications depends on:Pregnancy condition Perceived threat to mother or fetus Coping skills Available support Disequilibrium, feelings of powerlessness, increased anxi-ety and fear, and a sense of loss are all responses to thenews of a pregnancy complication. The pregnant woman may distance herself emotionallyfrom the fetus as she faces varying levels of uncertaintyabout the pregnancy, impacting attachment (Gilbert, 2010). Events such as antepartal hospitalization or activityrestrictions may contribute to a greater incidence ofdepression in the pregnant woman.BOX 5-2 TIPS FOR SIBLING PREPARATION Pregnancy: Take the child on a prenatal visit. Let the child listen to thefetal heartbeat and feel the baby move. Take the child to the homes of friends who have babies to givethem an opportunity to see firsthand what babies are like. Take the child on a tour of the hospital or birthing center;if available, enroll in a sibling preparation class, it ageappropriate. After the Birth: Encourage parents to be sensitive to the changes the siblingis experiencing; that jealousy and a sense of loss are normalfeelings at this time. Plan for high-quality, uninterrupted time with the older child. Encourage older children to participate in care of their sib-ling, i.e., bringing a diaper, singing to the baby, sitting withMom during infant feeding times. Teach a parent to be watchful when the older child is with thenewborn; natural expressions of sibling jealousy may involverough handling, slapping or hitting, throwing toys, etc. Reassure parents that regressive behaviors in the very youngchild may be a normal part of sibling adjustment (i.e., returnto diapers, wanting to breastfeed or take a bottle, tantrums),and with consistent attention and patience the behaviors willdecrease. Praise the child for acting age appropriately; show the childhow and where to touch the baby. In the hospital: encourage sibling visitation; call older chil-dren on the phone; have visitors greet the older child beforefocusing on the newborn. Give a gift to the new sibling from the newborn; let the sib-ling select a gift for the baby before delivery to bring to thenewborn after the birth.3704_Ch05_087-114 16/09/13 10:08 AM Page 99UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 100 The risk of crisis for the pregnant woman and her familyclearly increases due to an unpredictable or uncertainpregnancy outcome (Durham, 1998). How a woman and her family respond to this additionalstress is crucial in determining whether a crisis will develop.Having a realistic perception of the event, adequate situa-tional support, and positive coping mechanisms are all factors that help a woman maintain her equilibrium and avoid crisis. Poor self-esteem, lack of confidence in the mothering role,and an inability to communicate concerns to health careproviders and close family members are all factors thatincrease the risk of crisis. Nursing Actions When caring for a pregnant woman with complications, thefirst priority is to re-establish and maintain physiologic stability.However, nurses must also be able to intervene to promote psy-chosocial adaptation to the news of pregnancy complications(Giurgescu et al., 2006; Lederman, 2011; Mattson & Smith,2010) (see Concept Map: Maternal Adaptation to PregnancyComplications). The following actions can assist to reduce orlimit the detrimental effects of complications on individual orfamily functioning:Provide frequent and clear explanations about the problem,planned interventions, and therapy. Assess and encourage the use of the woman's supportsystems. Support individual adaptive coping mechanisms. Make appropriate referrals when additional assistance isneeded. SOCIAL SUPPORT DURING PREGNANCY Social support refers to that support given by someone with whom the expectant mother has a personal relationship. Itinvolves the primary groups of most importance to the indi-vidual woman. During pregnancy, the predominant sources ofsupport for the woman are her spouse or partner, and thewoman's mother. A high-quality relationship with one's part-ner has a positive effect on physical and emotional well-being(Logsdon, 2000; Ngui, 2009; Lederman, 2011). Social sup-port takes several forms: material, emotional, informational,and comparison support have all been identified as importanttypes of support for the pregnant woman.Material (aka instrumental) support consists of practicalhelp such as assistance with chores, meals, and managingfinances. Emotional support involves support that gives affection,approval, and encouragement feelings of togetherness. Informational support consists of sharing information,helping women investigate new sources of information. Comparison support consists of help given by someone ina similar situation. Their shared information is useful andcredible because they are experiencing or have experi-enced the same events in their lives.Social Support Research Research from several disciplines provides evidence for theimportance of social support for the pregnant woman'shealth, positive adaptation to pregnancy, and the preventionof pregnancy complications. It is a naturally occurringresource that can prevent health problems and complicationsand promote health. Receiving adequate help from othersenhances self-esteem and feelings of being in control (seeEvidence-Based Practice: Measurable Outcomes of SocialSupport Intervention). Women who have little support dur-ing pregnancy are more likely to begin prenatal care late andexperience depression during pregnancy and postpartum(Beeber & Canuso, 2009).Social support benefits the expectant mother the mostwhen it matches the pregnant woman's expectations,referred to as perceived social support. It is importantthat the woman identify and clarify her expectations andneeds for support. Perceived support expectations that do not materialize for the pregnant woman can lead to increased distress and problems with adaptation to pregnancy (Ngai, 2010). Pregnant women frequently need social support that differs from that they receive. Nurses can advise the pregnant woman how best to use her existing supportnetworks or how to expand her support network so herneeds are met. Nurses have the opportunity and responsi-bility to help women explore potential sources of supportsuch as childbirth education classes, church, work, orschool. High-risk populations including adolescents,women with pregnancy complications, and low-incomewomen may need particular direction from nurses inobtaining adequate support (Beeber & Canuso, 2005;Logsdon et al., 2005). A woman's cultural background also influences theamount of social support received and who provides this support. Women in cultures that value individual-ism, self-sufficiency, and independence may have moredifficulty receiving social support than those from a culture that values interdependence and collectivism(Meleis, 2003). Recent immigrants face many challenges in obtainingneeded social support. The disruption of lifelong attach-ments can cause anxieties and a sense of disorientation.Language barriers and socioeconomic struggles are additional stressors facing immigrant women, creating a higher risk for depression (Zelkowitz et al., 2004).Their families, experiencing the same difficulties, maynot be able to provide sufficient support. Further researchis needed in the area of examining the impact of cultureon social support. Social support is not considered professional support,although professionals can provide supportive actionssuch as counseling, teaching, role modeling, or problemsolving. When expectant mothers have no other means 3704_Ch05_087-114 16/09/13 10:08 AM Page 100CHAPTER 5 The Psycho-Social-Cultural Aspects of the Antepartum Period 101 of support, some community programs will employ para-professionals to visit expectant mothers, providing educa-tion and social support. Programs which capitalize on theskills of experienced mothers living in the communitiesmay be less expensive and more culturally sensitive thanpurely hospital-based programs led by teams of healthcare professionals. Additionally, post-delivery follow-upprograms offering home-based social support may alsohave important benefits for socially disadvantaged moth-ers and children (Cannella, Dawley & Beam, 2005;Logsdon, 2000; Logsdon et al., 2005).that social support improves pregnancy outcomes, the follow-ing nursing actions are recommended:Provide opportunities for the woman to ask for support,and rehearse with her appropriate language to use in ask-ing for support. Invite key support providers to attend prenatal and post-partum visits. Facilitate supportive functioning and interactions withinthe family. Encourage the pregnant woman to interact with otherpregnant or postpartum women she knows. Suggest church, health clubs, work and/or school as sitesto meet women with similar interests and concerns. Provide information regarding community resources. CHILDBEARING AND CULTURE Childbirth is a time of transition and celebration in all cultures(Callister, 2014). Culture is a distinct way of life that charac- terizes a particular community of people. It has a significantinfluence on a client's perspective on health. Every culture hasa set of behaviors, beliefs, and practices that influence womenand their families profoundly during childbearing. Culture canaffect how women think, make decisions, and act. A culturallyresponsive nurse recognizes these influences and considersthem carefully when planning care (Amidi-Nouri, 2011;Moore, Moos, & Callister, 2010). See Box 5-3 for further cultural information.It is critical that nurses acquire the knowledge and skillsto provide quality care to culturally divergent groups.Expectations of nursing practice will increasingly demandsensitivity to the cultural needs of families and compe-tence in providing care. All nursing care is given within the context of many cul-tures: that of the patient, nurse, health care system, and thelarger culture of the society. A holistic approach to carewill provide the most effective outcomes (Meleis, 2003). Statistics of the U.S. Population The U.S. Census Bureau identifies five major groups in the United States: African American/Blacks, AmericanIndian/Alaska Native, Asian American/Pacific Islander,Hispanic/Latino, and Arab-Americanand populations together comprise another 2%-3% ofthe total population (Semenic, Callister, & Feldman, 2004;U.S. Census, 2010). From a global perspective, the movementof immigrants, refugees, and diplomatic and military per-sonnel and their families worldwide has resulted in increas-ingly diverse populations. Although the U.S. Census hasclassified these populations primarily by race, it is importantto recognize that many may also identify with their countryof origin, or ethnicity. Indeed, the 2010 U.S. Census hasexpanded its classifications in an attempt to achieve greaterclarity and includes Hispanic/Latino as a population as wellas an option to select multiple races (Table 5-2).Evidenced-Based Practice: Measurable Outcomesof Social Support Interventions There is substantial evidence that social support interventionsimprove pregnancy outcomes on the following factors:Attachment to infant and improved interactions with infantCompliance with health care regimenImproved functional statusImproved copingImproved birth lonelinessSatisfaction with supportSatisfaction with intimate relationships Source: Logsdon, 2000. Assessing Social Support Assessing social support is a crucial component of prenatalcare. The following areas of assessment should be addressedwhen planning care:Who is available to help provide support? Who is avail-able to provide each type of support (material, emotional,informational, and comparison)? Is the support adequatein each category? With whom does the pregnant woman have the strongestrelationships, and what type of support is provided bythese individuals? Is there conflict in relationships with support providers? Is there potential for improvement of the woman'ssupport network? Should members who provide morestress than support be deleted? Should new membersbe added? Who are the people living with the pregnant woman? Who assists with household chores? Who assists with child care and parenting activities? Who does the pregnant woman turn to when problemsoccur or during a crisis? Nursing Actions The nurse has an important role in promoting social supportduring pregnancy (Logston, 2000). Due to the strong evidence3704_Ch05_087-114 16/09/13 10:08 AM Page 101UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 102 Culturally Based Behavioral Practices Cultural practices can be viewed from a variety of dimensions,which nurses need to consider when planning care (Moore,Moos, & Callister, 2010).Decision MakingAre decisions made by the woman alone or by others such as her partner, extended family, male elders, spiritualleaders?Concept of TimeIs the culture past, present, or future oriented? This may affect the woman's understanding about the need for specifictime commitments, such as prenatal care appointments. The dominant U.S. culture is future oriented, which means people act today with expectations for future rewards.Cultures that are not future oriented may not see the need forpreventative care.CommunicationVerbal communication may be challenging due to lan- guage barriers, meanings of words in different cultures, orhow willing a client is to disclose personal information. Cultures may have different practices regarding such non- verbal communication practices as eye contact, personal space,use of gestures, facial expressions, and appropriate touching.ReligionMay have a powerful influence on sexual attitudes and behaviors.WorldviewA client's understanding of how human life fits into the larger picture. How is illness explained? Examples include ancestral dis- pleasure, body imbalance, breach of taboo, evil eye, germ the-ory, spirit possession.Modesty and GenderWhat are the norms for interaction between men and women? Some cultures accept public exposure of the human body, while in others, women are expected to cover almost all theirbodies. Common Themes for the Childbearing Family During the prenatal period, preventing harm to the fetus andensuring a safe and easy birth are common themes throughvarious cultures. Common themes influencing labor anddelivery include general attitudes toward birth, preferred posi-tions, methods of pain management, and the role of familymembers and the health care provider.The postpartum period is generally considered to be a timeof increased vulnerability for both mothers and babies, influ-encing care of the new mother as well as infant care prac-tices related to bathing, swaddling, feeding, umbilical cordcare, and circumcision (Lauderdale, 2011; Mattson, 2010). Pregnancy and childbirth may elicit certain customs andbeliefs during pregnancy about acceptable and unaccept-able practices which have implications for planning nurs-ing care and interventions. All of these beliefs must betaken into consideration when assessing and promotingadaptation to pregnancy (Box 5-4). Prescriptive behavior is an expected behavior of the preg- nant woman during the childbearing period. Restrictive behavior describes activities during the child- bearing period which are limited for the pregnant woman.BOX 5-3 RESOURCES FOR FURTHER CULTURAL INFORMATION Africa online: www.africaonline.com/siteAlliance for Hispanic Health: www.hispanichealth.orgAmerican www.theodora. com/resource.html Arab www.al-bab.comAsian and Pacific Language Line: www.languageline.comGay Society: www.tcns.org TABLE 5-2 U.S. NATIONAL POPULATION BY RACE AND ETHNICITY, 2010 CENSUS EXAMPLES OF PERCENT OF U.S. GROUP ETHNIC ORIGIN POPULATIONWhite Europe, 72.4 North Africa African Africa, West Indies, 12.6 American/ Dominican Republic, Black Haiti, Jamaica Asian American China, Japan, Korea, 4.8 Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, India, Pakistan American Indian/ Navajo, Cherokee, 0.9 Alaska Native Aleut Hispanic or 16.3 Latino Native Hawaiian Fiji, Tonga, 0.2 and other American Samoa Pacific Islander Some other race 6.2 Two or more 2.9 races3704_Ch05_087-114 16/09/13 10:08 AM Page 102CHAPTER 5 The Psycho-Social-Cultural Aspects of the Antepartum Period 103 Taboos are cultural restrictions believed to have serious supernatural consequences.Cultural practices can also be classified as functional (enhances well-being), neutral (does not harm or help), ornon-functional (potentially harmful). Nurses must be able todifferentiate among these beliefs and practices, and respectfunctional and neutral practices even if they differ from theirown beliefs (Box 5-5). Nurses need to keep in mind that few cultural customs related to pregnancy are dangerous; although they mightcause a woman to limit her activity and her exposure to someaspects of life, they are rarely harmful to herself or her fetus.When encountering non-functional practices, the nurseshould first try to understand the meaning of the practice forthe woman and her family and then work carefully to bringabout change. An example of a non-functional practice wouldbe the ingestion of clay during pregnancy (Lauderdale, 2011;Moore, Moos, & Callister, 2010). Barriers to Culturally Sensitive Care Cultural health disparities are created when nurses and othercare providers fail to understand the importance of clientbeliefs about health and illness (Moore, Moos, & Callister,2010). Nurses' attitudes can create barriers to culturally com- petent care. Ethnocentrism, the belief that the customs and values of the dominant culture are preferred or superior insome way, creates obstacles that can make culturally sensitivecare challenging to implement. Stereotyping, the assumption that everyone in a group is the same as everyone else in thegroup, also creates barriers. Contributing to barriers is:Lack of diversity of health care providersOnly 16% of registered nurses come from racial or ethnicminority backgrounds (U.S. DHHS, 2010). There is strong evidence that the quality of health carevaries as a function of race, ethnicity, and language(Amidi-Nouri, 2011; Meleis, 2003; Moore, Moos, &Callister, 2010). Mainstream models of obstetric care as practiced inNorth America can present a strange and confusing pic-ture to many women from different ethnic backgrounds.The predominant culture's emphasis on formal prenatalcare, technology, hospital deliveries, and a bureaucratichealth care system presents barriers to care for manygroups.Protocols, a strange environment, and health careproviders who only speak English all create barriers thatconfuse, intimidate, and result in inadequate access to care. Health literacy, or a person's ability to obtain and usehealth information, may also be affected by language, cul-tural traditions, and beliefs. Groups with low or marginalhealth literacy skills may not be able to gather and processhealth information in a useful way (Ferguson, 2008). These obstacles to health care significantly contribute to healthcare disparities, or differences in care experienced by one pop-ulation compared with another population. (For furtherinformation on health care disparities, see Chapter 1.) Disparities also may occur in gender, age, economic status,religion, and sexual preference. Culturally Responsive Nursing Practice Nurses have an obligation to provide to patients and their fam-ilies effective, understandable, and respectful care in a mannerthat is compatible with their cultural beliefs, practices, andBOX 5-4 EXAMPLES OF CULTURAL PRESCRIPTIONS, RESTRICTIONS, AND TABOOS Prescriptive BeliefsRemain active during pregnancy to aid the baby's circulation.Remain happy to bring the baby joy and good fortune.Drink chamomile tea to ensure an effective labor.Soup with ginseng root is a good general strength tonic.Pregnancy cravings need to be satisfied or the baby will be born with a birthmark. Sleep flat on your back to protect the fetus from harm.Attach a safety pin to an undergarment to protect the fetus from cleft lip or palate. Restrictive BeliefsDo not have your picture taken because it might cause stillbirth.Avoid sexual intercourse during the third trimester because it will cause respiratory distress in the newborn. Coldness in any form may cause arthritis or other chronic illness.Avoid seeing an eclipse of the moon; it will result in a cleft lip or palate. Do not reach over your head or the cord will wrap around the baby's neck. TaboosAvoid funerals, and visits from widows or women who have lost children because they will bring bad fortune to the baby. Avoid hot and spicy foods as they can cause overexcitement for the pregnant woman. An early baby shower will invite the evil eye and should be avoided.Avoid praising the newborn; it will call the attention of the gods to the vulnerable infant.

Educational background, family heritage,social class, economic factors, work/occupational experience,urban/rural origin, length of time in the United States (orplace of migration), and a variety of individual characteristicsor choices such as sexual orientation, disability, and strength ofethnic identity will all influence how women experience healthand illness (Machado, 2001; Meleis, 2003). It is also important to recognize that socioeconomic factors may be blended with culturally influenced patterns of behavior.Variations that appear to be cultural may actually be a reflectionof socioeconomic conditions in which many minority groupslive. This arises in part because ethnic minorities tend to bepoorer than European Americans, are overrepresented amongthe very poor, and have fewer opportunities for education andupward mobility. The economic gap accentuates differences,and soon the assumption is made that observed differences arecultural in origin (May, 1994). Cultural Assessment When considering cultural aspects of care (Andrews & Boyle,2011; Moore, Moos, & Callister, 2010), the nurse caring forexpectant families must answer a variety of questions to indi-vidualize care:What is the woman's predominant culture? To whatdegree does the client identify with the cultural group? What language does the client speak at home? What arethe styles of nonverbal communication (for example, eyecontact, space orientation, touch)? How does the woman's culture influence her beliefs aboutpregnancy and childbirth? Is pregnancy considered a statepreferred language. The goal is to gain knowledge to create anenvironment in which a trusting relationship with the clientcan be developed (see Box 5-3).Mandates from professional health care accrediting bodiesand government agencies provide evidence of increasedcommitment to providing culturally appropriate healthcare. Examples of these directives include:The Joint Commission for Accreditation of Health CareOrganizations (JCAHCO) mandated plan of patient careincludes cultural and spiritual assessments and interventions(Andrews & Boyle, 2003). The American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN)has stated that nursing graduates should have the know -ledge and skills to provide holistic care that addresses theneeds of diverse populations. AACN has also published spe- cific end-of-program cultural competencies for baccalaureatenursing education (AACN, 2008). Cultural competence is addressed explicitly in the DHHSHealthy People 2020 focus area of health communications,stating that cultural sensitivity is necessary for effective com-munication with individuals and the public to stimulatesystems change and to influence health behavior (US DHSS,2010). The U.S. DHHS office of minority health has published 14 National Standards for Culturally and LinguisticallyAppropriate Services (CLAS Standards) (U.S. DHHS,1999). Culturally sensitive nursing practice (see CriticalComponent: Strategies for Nurses: Improving CulturallyResponsive Care):If the nurse is willing to maintain an open attitude andsensitivity to differences, the chances of providing culturallycompetent care increase greatly. CRITICAL COMPONENT Use the cultural wisdom (beliefs, values, customs, and habits)of the client to shape his or her participation in health prac-tices and care plans. Seek out client-friendly teaching and assessment tools. Review the literature to generate a culture database. Read literature from other cultures. Participate in professional development/continuing educationprograms which address cultural competence. Recognize all care is given within the context of many cultures. Develop linguistic skills related to your client population. Learn to use nonverbal communication in an appropriate way. Learn about the communication patterns of various cultures. Advocate for organizational change. Understand and apply the various regulatory standards(CLAS, AACN, etc.). Promote cultural practices that are helpful, tolerate practicesthat are neutral, and work to educate women to avoid prac-tices that are potentially harmful.Strategies for Nurses: Improving Culturally Responsive Care Maintain an open attitude. Recognize yourself as a part of the diversity in society andacknowledge your own belief system. Examine the biases and assumptions you hold about differentcultures. Avoid preconceptions and cultural stereotyping. Explore and acknowledge historical and current portrayals ofracial and ethnic groups in society. Develop an understanding of how racial or ethnic differencesaffect the quality of health care. Acknowledge the power you have to use professional privilegepositively or negatively. Recall your commitment to \"individualized care,\" \"respect,\"and \"professionalism.\" Identify who the client calls \"family.\" Include notes on cultural preferences and family strengths andresources as part of all intake and ongoing assessments, andnursing care plans and care maps. (Callister, 2014; Amidi-Nouri, 2011; Moos, & 104CHAPTER 5 The Psycho-Social-Cultural Aspects of the Antepartum Period 105 of illness or health? How does the culture explain illness?Are there particular attitudes towards age at the time ofpregnancy? Marriage? Who would be an acceptablefather or partner? What is considered acceptable in termsof pregnancy frequency? Are there cultural prescriptions, restrictions, or taboosrelated to certain activities, dietary practices, or expressionsof emotion? What does the pregnant woman consider tobe normal practice during pregnancy, birth, postpartum? How does the woman interpret and respond to experi-ences of pain? How is modesty expressed by men and women? Are there culturally defined expectations about male-female relationships? What is the client's educational background? Does it affecther knowledge level concerning the health care deliverysystem, teaching/learning, written material given? How does the client relate to persons outside her culturalgroup? Does she prefer a caregiver with the same culturalbackground? What is the role of religious beliefs related to pregnancyand childbirth? How are childbearing decisions made, and who isinvolved in the decision making process? How does the woman's predominant culture view theconcept of time? (Cultures may be past, present, or futureoriented.) How does the woman's culture explain illness? (Examples:ancestral displeasure, germ theory, etc.) Nursing Actions With the increasing diverse patient population, it is imperativenurses provide culturally sensitive care. Professionals mustacknowledge belief and value systems different from their own,and consider these differences when delivering care to childbear-ing women and their families (Callister, 2008; communicationGreet respectfully Establish rapport Demonstrate empathy and interest Listen actively Emphasize the woman's strengths; consider eachwoman's individuality regarding how she conforms to tra-ditional values and norms. Respect functional and neutral practices. If proposed practices are non-functional, work with thewoman and her support network to bring about change. Accommodate cultural practices as appropriate. Identify who the client calls \"family.\" Determine who the family decision makers are andinclude them. Provide an interpreter when necessary (Box 5-6). Recognize that a patient agreeing and nodding \"yes\" tothe nurse's instruction or questions may not always guar-antee comprehension. Use nonverbal communication and visual aids in anappropriate way.When providing patient education, include family andelicit support from the established caretakers in thefamily (i.e., grandmother, aunt, etc.). Demonstrate how scientific and folk practices can becombined to provide optimal care. PLANNING FOR BIRTH Planning and preparing for childbirth requires many decisionsby the woman and her family during pregnancy (i.e., choosinga provider, choosing a place of birth, planning for the birth,and preparing for labor through education). These choicesaffect how the woman approaches her pregnancy and cancontribute significantly to a positive adaptation. Choosing a Provider One of the first decisions a woman makes is who will be hercare provider during her pregnancy and birth. This importantdecision also influences where her birth will take place. Physicians Obstetricians and family practice physicians attend approxi-mately 91% of births in the United States. Most physicianscare for their patients in a hospital setting.Care often includes pharmacologic and medical manage-ment of problems as well as use of technologic procedures. Their practice includes both low- and high-risk patients. Midwives The focus of midwifery care is on non-interventionist care,with an emphasis on the normalcy of the birth process.Midwives care for women in hospital settings, alternativebirth centers, or a home setting. In many countries, midwives are the primary providers ofcare for healthy pregnant women, and physicians are con-sulted when medical or surgical intervention is required(Kennedy & Shannon, 2004). Nurse-midwives are registered nurses with advance train-ing in care of obstetric patients. They provide care for BOX 5-6 WORKING WITH AN INTERPRETER A trained medical interpreter should be used for medical inter-pretations. A friend or family member may not understandterms used by the health care provider. A woman may be dis-cussing issues she wants to keep private. The interpreter can bea valuable member of the health care team. The nurse should be alert to the client's nonverbal cues and ask the patient to repeat information that she needs to recalllater. Many nursing schools and health care institutions may pro- hibit nursing students from interpreting, for example, to obtainconsent for a procedure, because limited knowledge about theprocedure may lead the student to give inaccurate information.

Nurse-midwives practicewith physicians or independently with a contracted healthcare provider agency for physician backup. Lay midwives manage about 1% of the births in theUnited States and Canada, with the majority taking placein the home setting. Their training varies greatly, frombeing self-taught to having formal training and licensing. Direct entry midwives are trained in midwifery schools oruniversities as a profession distinct from nursing.Increasing numbers of midwives in the United Kingdomand Ireland fall into this category. Given the variations in midwifery training and knowl-edge, pregnant women considering midwifery care mayneed education and information regarding the experienceand credentials of the midwife providing their care inorder to make informed decisions (Box 5-7). Choosing a Place of BirthHospitals In the United States, approximately 99% of all births takeplace in hospital settings. Hospital maternity services can vary greatly, from tradi-tional labor and delivery rooms with separate newbornand postpartum units to in-hospital birth centers. Labor, delivery, and recovery rooms (LDRs) may be avail-able in which the expectant mother is admitted, labors,gives birth, and spends the first 2 hours of recovery. In labor, delivery, recovery, postpartum units (LDRPs),the mother remains in the same room for her entire hospital stay. Birth Centers Free-standing birth centers are usually built in locationsseparate from the hospital but may be located nearby incase transfer of the woman or newborn is needed. Only women at low risk for complications are includedin care. Birth centers are usually staffed by nurse-midwives orphysicians who also have privileges at the local hospital. They offer homelike accommodations, with emergencyequipment available but stored out of view. Home Births Home births are popular in European countries such asSweden and the Netherlands, with rigorous screeningpolicies in place to ensure that only low-risk women arehaving home births, and are attended by trained mid-wives (deJong, 2009). In developing countries, home birth may occur due to thelack of hospitals or adequate birthing facilities. In the United States, home births account for less than1% of births. In the North American medical community,many have concluded that home birth exposes the motherand fetus to unnecessary danger. Consequently, a womanseeking a home birth may find it more challenging to finda qualified health care provider willing to give prenatalcare and attend the birth. Home births allow the expectant family to be in controlof the experience, and the mother may be more relaxedthan in the hospital environment. It may be less expen-sive, and there may be decreased risk of serious infection. If home birth is the woman's choice, the following crite-ria will promote a safe home birth experience:The woman must be comfortable with her decision. The woman should be in good health; home birth is not forhigh-risk pregnancy.BOX 5-7 PROFESSIONAL POSITION STATEMENT: AWHONN POSITION STATEMENT ONMIDWIFERY AWHONN supports the practice of the certified nurse-midwife as a primary care provider who is prepared to inde-pendently manage most aspects of women's health care. Thecertified nurse-midwife's practice should include appropriateprofessional consultation, collaboration, and referral as indi-cated by the health status of the patient and applicable stateand federal laws.BackgroundAWHONN identifies a wide range of disparate educationalrequir ements and certification standards in the United States that fall under the umbrella category of midwifery. The follow-ing titles are attributed to midwives without prior nursing cre-dentials who are not graduates of ACNM-accredited programs:direct entry, lay, licensed, or professional. Direct entry midwivescover the spectrum from the doctorally prepared Europeanmidwife to the self-taught, beginning practitioner. The wide range of what is actually meant by the designation \"midwife\" can easily confuse consumers, health care institutions,and legislators. Definitions of various certification levels are: CNM: Certified Nurse-Midwife (administered by ACNM) CM: Certified by ACNM) CPM: Certified Professional Midwife [administered byNARM (North American Registry of Midwives)]. Alsoreferred to as direct entry, lay, orlicensed midwife. Midwives with a state license or permit (administered on astate-by-state basis). Also referred to as direct entry, lay, or licensed midwife. Midwives without formal credentials (no administrative over-sight). Also referred to as direct entry or lay midwife. Individual state-by-state laws govern the practice of midwifery in the United States. Certified nurse-midwives and certified mid-wives often practice in collaboration and consultation with otherhealth care professionals to provide primary, gynecological, andmaternity care to women in the context of the larger health caresystem. Certified nurse-midwives may have prescriptive privileges,admitting privileges to hospitals, and may own and/or managefreestanding practices. The scope of practice for a direct entry, orlay, midwife who is not ACC accredited is typically limited to thepractice of home birth or birth center options for women, butvaries according to state-by-state regulations. Source: Association of Women's Health, and The Psycho-Social-Cultural Aspects of the Antepartum Period 107 The woman should have access to a good transportationsystem in case of transfer to the hospital. The woman should be attended by a well-trained healthcare provider with adequate medical supplies and resusci-tation equipment (Romano, 2010; deJong, 2009). The Birth Plan A birth plan is a tool by which parents can explore their child-birth options and choose those that are most important tothem. A written birth plan can help women clarify theirdesires and expectations and communicate those desires withtheir care providers (Lothian, 2006).Birth plans typically emphasize specific requests for laborand immediate post-delivery care. Some involve expecta-tions surrounding postpartum and newborn care as well. The birth plan document can be inserted into thewoman's prenatal record or hospital chart as a way ofcommunicating with care providers. The Doula The word \"doula\" comes from ancient Greek and means\"woman's servant\" (ICEA, 1999). A doula is an individual who provides support to women and their partners duringlabor, birth, and postpartum. The doula does not provideclinical care.Continuous support by a trained doula during labor hasbeen associated with shorter labors, decreased need foranalgesics, decreased need for many forms of medicalinterventions, and increased maternal satisfaction(Campbell, Lake, Pascali-Bonaro &Kroeger, 2004). women should be made aware of the benefits ofdoula care. Many hospitals have implemented doula services that areeither free or fee-based. (Mottl-Santiago, Walker, Ewan,Vragovic, Winder, & Stubblefield, 2008). Childbirth Education The roots of prenatal education began in the early 1900s withclasses in maternal hygiene, nutrition, and baby care taught bythe American Red Cross in New York City. Childbirth edu-cation as we know it today developed as a consumer responseto the increasing medical control and technologic manage-ment of normal labor and birth during the 1950s and 1960sin Europe and North America. Early proponents of child-birth education such as Lamaze, Bradley, and Dick-Readfocused primarily on the prevention of pain childbirth.Methods childbirth\" (Dick-Read), \"psychopro-phylaxis\" among middle-classgroups. Childbirth education has evolved since that timetowards a more eclectic approach. The focus has shifted awayfrom rigid techniques to embrace a philosophy that \"affirmsthe normalcy of birth, acknowledges women's inherent abil-ity to birth their babies, and explores all the ways that womenfind strength and comfort during labor and birth\" (LamazeInternational, 2009; Walker, 2009). The content of child-birth education classes has also greatly expanded, assistingwomen and their families to make informed decisions aboutpregnancy and birth based on knowledge of their options andchoices.Specialized classes have been developed to meet the needsof specific groups as well (e.g., classes for breastfeeding;sibling preparation; and refresher, or prenatal/postpartumexercise, online childbirth preparation). Programs havebeen developed for adolescents, mothers expecting twins,and mothers older than 35. Nurses and childbirth educa-tors have played an important role in the development ofthese innovative education programs. Professional organizations including InternationalChildbirth Education Association ( ICEA), LamazeInternational, and Association of Women's Health,Obstetrics and Neonatal Nursing (AWHONN) have allpublished position papers that delineate expectations ofbasic components of prenatal education. Through thedevelopment of position papers as well as teacher trainingand certification programs, these organizations haveensured that childbirth educators have a sound knowl-edge base and specific competencies. The Healthy People 2020 Maternal Infant and ChildHealth goals include an objective that commits toincreasing the proportion of pregnant women whoattend a formal series of prepared childbirth classes (U.S. DHHS, 2010). The overall goal of childbirth education is to promote thecompetence of expectant parents in meeting the chal-lenges of childbirth and early parenting. The focus is onpromoting healthy pregnancy and birth outcomes andfacilitating a positive transition to parenting. Class content typically includes the physical and emotional aspects of pregnancy, childbirth and earlyparenting, coping skills, and labor support techniques(Box 5-8). Values clarification and informed decision making areemphasized, as well as the promotion of wellness behav-iors, and healthy birth practices. Pregnant women areencouraged to identify their own unique goals for child-birth (Green & Hotelling, 2009; Lothian, 2011). Class formats have evolved to meet the varied needs ofexpectant families and may include a traditional weeklyseries, one-day intensives, or online classes.Childbirth classes remain a popular and well-established component of care during the childbearing years. However, theevidence regarding the effects of antenatal education remainsinconclusive. As the body of research on childbirth and child-birth education increases and as more childbirth educators useresearch findings as a basis for their teaching, evidence-basedpractice will be enhanced (see Evidence-Based Practice:Effectiveness 10:08 AM Page 107UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 108 Nurses need to be aware of these powerful influences onthe health-related decisions of childbearing women andtheir families. The quality of information and advicevaries widely. For a list of reliable Internet resources forparent education, see Box 5-9.Evidence-Based Practice: Effectiveness ofAntenatal Education Gagnon, A. J., & Sandall, J. (2007). Individual or group antenatal education forchildbirth or parenthood, or both. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews2007, Issue 3. Art. No.: CD002869. A great deal of research has attempted to assess the effective-ness of antenatal education in preparing women for pregnancy,birth, and child care. Researchers have attempted to link atten-dance at childbirth classes with a variety of outcomes, includingshorter labors, higher Apgar scores, decreased incidence ofcesarean sections, decreased anxiety, breastfeeding success,pain management, maternal satisfaction, infant care competen-cies, and teaching methods (Gagnon & Sandall, 2007). Themajority of the evidence has been inconclusive. Difficulties withsample size, poorly designed methodologies, and lack of fund-ing have persistently hindered the creation of an evidence-basedbody of knowledge. The effects of general antenatal educationfor childbirth or parenthood, or both, remain largely unknown.Despite its popularity, more research is needed to determine theeffects and benefits of childbirth education in a variety of pop-ulations and programs, and to ensure that effective ways ofhelping health professionals support pregnant women and theirpartners in preparing for birth and parenting are investigated sothat the resources used meet the needs of parents and their new-born infants.BOX 5-8 PERINATAL EDUCATION: SAMPLE CONTENT IN CLASS IntroductionIntroductionsOver view of childbir th education: Rationale and pain theory Physical and emotional changes of pregnancy; fetal developmentNutrition, exercise, and self-care during pregnancyIntroduction to breathing and relaxation techniquesLaborSigns of laborStages and phases of labor and deliver y Labor support techniques; the role of the support person in laborPractice of breathing and relaxation techniquesBirth PlansLabor review, incorporating labor support techniques and non- pharmacological comf or t strategies Birth options and birth plans: Developing advocacy skillsPharmacological interventionsPractice of breathing and relaxation techniquesHospital tourVariations in LaborVariations of labor: back labor, prodromal labor, precipitous labor Cesar ean deliver y Medical procedures (IVs, episiotomy, assisted delivery, EFM, Pitocin, epidurals) Practice of relaxation and breathing techniquesNewbornReview of labor; practice of relaxation and breathing techniquesNewborn car e Br eastfeeding PostpartumPostpartum and transition to parenthoodCommunity r esources f or new parentsIn addition to classes, there are books, pamphlets, maga-zines, and videos aimed at childbearing women and theirfamilies.

PATIENT EDUCATION Mobile Phone Education: Text4BabyText4Baby is an innovative educational program offering peri-natal education via t ext messages. It is estimated that over 90% of American households have cell phones, with the majority ofthose phones with text messaging capabilities. The programwas developed through a collaboration of public and privateagencies, including the National Healthy Mothers HealthyBabies Coalition, Voxiva, Johnson & Johnson, the Departmentof Health & Human Services, and Office of Science andTechnology. Message content was reviewed by an interdiscipli-nary panel of experts to ensure the information reflected evi-dence-based practice. Once signed up for the service, women will receive three free SMS text messages each week timed to their due dates. Theprogram provides vital health information to pregnant womenand new mothers. Examples of topics include nutrition, season-al flu prevention and treatment, mental health topics, risks oftobacco use, oral health, and safe infant sleeping.

The focus of the chapter is on tests for at-risk and/or high-risk pregnancies. Common maternal con-ditions indicating need for antenatal tests are presented inTable 6-1. The purpose, indication, basic procedure, inter-pretation, advantages, risks, and nursing actions are out-lined. Specifics on procedures are not detailed as they mayvary from institution to institution. Routine tests per-formed during pregnancy are presented in Chapter 4.Antenatal tests are often performed as outpatient proce-dures, such as ultrasound, amniocentesis, and non-stresstests. Antenatal tests may also be performed during an antenatal hospitalization for a high-risk pregnancy. Thenurse's role and responsibility related to antenatal tests may vary based on the inpatient or outpatient setting.Nursing care may be provided before, during, and/or after aprocedure.ASSESSMENT FOR RISK FACTORS The nurse needs to assess for factors that place the womanand/or her fetus at risk for adverse outcomes:Biophysical factors originate from the mother or fetus and impact the development or function of the mother orfetus. They include genetic, nutritional, medical, andobstetric issues (see Table 6-1 ). Psychosocial factors are maternal behaviors or lifestyles that have a negative effect on the mother or fetus.Examples include smoking, caffeine use, alcohol/druguse, and psychological status. Sociodemographic factors are variables that pertain tothe woman and her family and place the mother and thefetus at increased risk. Examples include access to prena-tal care, age, parity, marital status, income, and ethnicity. Environmental factors are hazards in the workplace or the general environment that impact pregnancy outcomes. 115 EXPECTED STUDENT OUTCOMES On completion of this chapter, the student will be able to: /H17040Define terms used in antenatal tests. /H17040Identify the purpose and indication for key antenatal tests. /H17040Describe the procedure, interpretation, advantages, and risks of common antenatal tests. /H17040Articulate the nursing responsibilities related to key antenatal tests. /H17040Identify patient teaching needs related to antenatal tests. Nursing Diagnosis /H17039Knowledge decit related to antenatal tests /H17039Anxiety related to antenatal tests /H17039Risk of fetal injury or death related to invasive antenatal testsNursing Outcomes /H17039The pregnant woman and her family will verbalize underst anding of antenatal tests. /H17039The pregnant woman will be able to make informed decisions. /H17039Complications of antenatal tests will be identified promptly and appropriate nursing interventions will be initiated.3704_Ch06_115-130 16/09/13 10:08 AM Page 115UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 116 Various environmental substances can affect fetal develop-ment. Examples include exposure to chemicals, radiation,and pollutants.The underlying mechanism for how some risk factors impact pregnancy outcomes is not fully understood. Manyrisk factors appear to have a combined or cumulative effect.Identification of risk factors for poor perinatal outcomes isessential to minimize maternal and neonatal morbidity andmortality. Risk factors are described in more detail inChapters 7, 10, 14, and 17 as they relate specifically to preg-nancy, labor, the postpartum period, and the neonate. THE NURSE'S ROLE IN ANTEPARTAL TESTING The nurse's role during antepartal testing varies based on thespecific test. In general, it includes assessment of risk factors andproviding information and emotional support and comfort towomen undergoing antenatal tests. Many women having ante-natal tests are at high risk for fetal and maternal complicationsand are anxious and vulnerable. In some instances, the nurseassists or performs the antenatal test, but in most instances thisrequires advanced competencies (i.e., ultrasound). To provide appropriate support to families, nurses need to understand (Barron, 2014; Gilbert, 2011; Torgerson, 2001):The variety of tests available during pregnancy (see Critical Component: Antepartal Screening andDiagnostic Tests) The risks and benefits of tests/procedures The indications for the test/procedure The interpretation of findingsThe nursing care associated with the test/procedure The physical and psychological benefits, limitations, andimplications of the test/procedure Nursing Actions for Women Undergoing Antenatal Testing Establish a trusting relationship. One of the main functions of nursing is to promoteinformed decisions and prevent uninformed decisions bypatients. Assess for factors that place the woman and/or her fetusat risk for adverse outcomes. Provide information regarding the test.Explain how the test/procedure is performed. Explain potential risks and benefits. Explain what the woman can expect during the test/procedure. Explain what the test measures. Encourage questions. Encourage and foster open communication with providers. Provide online resources for further information (Box 6-1). Provide comfort.Assist woman into a comfortable position. Preserve the woman's modesty by closing doors and exposingonly the portions of her body necessary for the test/procedure. Reassure the woman and her significant other.Address the woman's and her significant other's concernsregarding the test/procedure such as type of discomfort orpain she may experience and effects on her and/or herunborn child. If she prefers, encourage the woman's significant others tobe with her during procedures. Provide psychological support to the woman and her significant other (Fig. 6-1).Incorporate understanding of cultural and social issues. Remain with the woman and her significant other duringthe test/procedure. Assess for anxiety and provide care to reduce the level ofanxiety. Allow client to vent feelings and frustrations with the discomfort, time-consuming demands, and limitationsimposed by high-risk pregnancy and antenatal testing. Allow the woman to express feelings related to high-riskpregnancy. Encourage expression and exploration of feelings. Document the woman's response and the results of tests. Report results of tests to providers. Schedule appropriate follow-up. Reinforce information given by the woman's providerregarding the results of the tests and need for furthertesting, treatment, or referral. BIOPHYSICAL ASSESSMENT Since the 1970s, the fetus has become more accessible withthe refinement of new technology such as ultrasound. Fetalphysiological parameters that can now be assessed includeTABLE 6-1 COMMON MATERNAL CONDITIONS INDICATING NEED FOR ANTENATAL TESTS PREEXISTING MEDICAL CONDITIONS PREGNANCY-RELATED CONDITIONS FETAL CONDITIONS Source: American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2002).

Limited ultra-sound can be used to measure amniotic fluid volume, to evaluate interval growth, to evaluate the cervix, to confirmfetal cardiac activity or fetal presentation as an adjunct toultrasound guided amniocentesis or external version, for con-firmation of embryonic number, for measurement of crown-rump length, or for confirmation of a yolk sac or uterine sacwith assisted reproductive technology. Specialized ultra-sounds include those involving fetal Doppler assessment, performance of biophysical profile (BPP), assessment ofamniotic fluid, fetal echocardiography, or measurement ofadditional fetal structures (AAP & ACOG, 2007). Timing Standard ultrasounds are typically done in the first trimester toconfirm pregnancy and calculate gestational age. Additionalultrasounds may be done at other times as needed.BOX 6-1 INFORMATIVE ONLINE RESOURCES American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG): http://acog.net Association of Women's Health, Obstetrics and http://awhonn.org Gene 6-1 Nurse counseling a pregnant woman.CRITICAL COMPONENT Antepartal Screening and Diagnostic Tests Screening TestA screening test is a test designed to identify those who arenot af f ected by a disease or abnormality. Some screening tests are offered to all pregnant women and include multiplemarker screening and ultrasound. Other screening tests are reserved for high-risk pregnancies to provide informationon fetal status and well-being. If the results of screening tests indicate an abnormality, fur ther testing is indicated. Screening tests include: Amniotic fluid index Biophysical prole Contraction stress test Daily fetal movement count Multiple marker screening: Alpha-fetoprotein screening,triple marker, and quad marker Non-stress artery Doppler flow Vibroacoustic stimulation Diagnostic TestsDiagnostic tests help to identify a particular disease or provideinformation which aids in the making of a diagnosis. Most f etal diagnostic tests are reserved for high-risk pregnancies wherethere is increased risk to fetus for developmental or physicalproblems. Prenatal diagnosis is the science of identifying struc-tural or functional anomalies or birth defects in the fetus(Cunningham et al., 2010). Diagnostic tests include: Amniocentesis Chorionic villi sampling Magnetic resonance imaging Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling Ultrasonographyfetal movement, urine production, and observing fetal struc-tures and blood flow. Tests used in biophysical assessment ofthe fetus are ultrasonography, umbilical artery Doppler flow,and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). UltrasonographyDefinition Ultrasonography is the use of high-frequency sound waves toproduce an image of an organ or tissue (Fig. 6-2). It is themost common diagnostic test during pregnancy (Cunninghamet al., 2010). Ultrasound use varies based on trimester (Table 6-2) and is commonly used to obtain vital information:Gestational age Fetal growth Fetal anatomy Placental abnormalities and location Fetal activity Amount of amniotic fluid Visual assistance for some invasive procedures such asamniocentesis.A standard ultrasound is one that is used for evaluating fetal presentation, amniotic fluid volume, cardiac activity,placental position, gestational age measurements, and fetalnumber (Fig. 6-3A). Other categories of ultrasound include3704_Ch06_115-130 16/09/13 10:08 Page 117UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 118 Procedures Transvaginal ultrasoundIs generally performed in the first trimester for earliervisualization of the fetus. The woman is in a lithotomy position. A sterile covered probe/transducer is inserted into the vagina. Abdominal ultrasound (Fig. 6-2)A full bladder is necessary to elevate the uterus out of thepelvis for better visualization when abdominal ultrasoundis performed during the first half of pregnancy.The woman is in a supine position. Transmission gel and transducer are placed on the maternal abdomen. The transducer is moved over the maternal abdomen tocreate an image of the structure being evaluated. Interpretation of Results Post-procedure interpretation is typically done by a practitioner such as a radiologist, obstetrician, or nurse-midwife. After specialized training, nurses can performlimited obstetrical ultrasound (Box 6-2). Ultrasound for gestational age is determined through mea - surements of fetal-crown rump length, biparietal diameter,and femur length. It is most accurate when performedbefore 20 weeks' gestation (AAP & ACOG, 2007). Normal findings for the fetus are appropriate gesta-tional age, size, viability, position, and functionalcapacities. Normal findings for the placenta are expected size, normal position and structure, and an adequate amnioticfluid volume. Abnormal findings should be referred for further testing and management of fetal anomalies (AAP & ACOG, 2007). Advantages Accurate assessments of gestational age, fetal growth, and detection of fetal and placental abnormalities Noninvasive Provides information on fetal structures and status Risks None, but controversy exists on the use of routine ultrasound for low-risk pregnant women as there is noevidence it improves outcomes.TABLE 6-2 INDICATIONS FOR ULTRASOUND BY TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY FIRST TRIMESTER SECOND TRIMESTER THIRD TRIMESTER Confirm intrauterine pregnancy.

Figure 6-2 Nurse explains ultrasound to a pregnant woman having an ultrasound test.3704_Ch06_115-130 16/09/13 10:08 AM Page 118CHAPTER 6 Antepartal Tests 119 Nursing Actions Explain the procedure to the woman and her family.Explain that ultrasound uses sound waves to produce animage of the baby. Assess for latex allergies with transvaginal ultrasound. For transvaginal, have patient put on gown and undressfrom waist down. For abdominal ultrasound, only thelower abdomen needs to be exposed. Inform the woman that a sterile sheathed probe is usedfor transvaginal ultrasound and is inserted into the vagi-na. Inform her that she may feel pressure, but no pain isusually felt. Position patient in lithotomy for transvaginal ultrasoundand supine for abdominal ultrasound. Provide comfort measures to the woman during the procedure such as a pillow under her head and a warmblanket above and below her abdomen. Be sensitive to cultural and social as well as modestyissues. Provide emotional support. Schedule appropriate follow-up. Document ultrasound examination according to the institutional policy. Three-Dimensional and Four-Dimensional UltrasoundDefinition Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound and four-dimensional(4D) ultrasound are more advanced types of trans-abdominalultrasounds that take thousands of images at once to producea 3D or 4D image. They allow for visualization of complexfacial movements and features, as well as the branching ofplacental stem vessels, and connection of the umbilical vesselsto the chorionic plate of the placenta (Fig. 6-3B). Currentrecommendations are that 3D ultrasound be used only as anadjunct to conventional ultrasonography. Purpose Standard determination of gestational age, fetal size,presentation, and volume of amniotic fluid Determination of complications such as vaginal bleeding,ventriculomegaly, hydrocephaly, and congenital braindefects Diagnosis of fetal malformations, pelvic abnor-malities, hypoxic ischemic brain injury, and inflammatorydisorders of the brain (Torgersen, 2011). Timing 3D and 4D ultrasounds are ordered as needed for furtherevaluation of possible fetal anomalies such as face andcardiac and skeletal. BOX 6-2 AWHONN ULTRASOUND GUIDELINES The Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and NeonatalNurses (AWHONN) has developed guidelines for the didacticand clinical preparation for nurses who perform limited obstet-ric ultrasound. A minimum of 8 hours of didactic content isrecommended in the following areas: (1) ultrasound physicsand instrumentation; (2) patient education; (3) nursingaccountability; (4) documentation; (5) image archiving; (6) legal and ethical issues; (7) lines of authority and responsi-bility (AWHONN, 2010). Currently there are no certification requirements for nurses performing limited ultrasound. Appropriate institutional poli-cies, didactic and clinical education, and evaluation compo-nents are needed to ensure competence for nurses to performlimited ultrasound.Assessing the number of fetusesAssessing for the presence or fetal activityAssessing fetal presentationAssessing placental locationAssessing amniotic Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN).

Interpretation of Results Same as ultrasound Advantages More detailed assessment of fetal structures 3D presentation of placental blood flow Measurement of fetal organs 4D ultrasound allows for evaluation of brain morphologyand identification of brain lesions. Risks Same as standard ultrasound Nursing Actions Same as standard ultrasound Umbilical Artery Doppler FlowDefinition Umbilical artery Doppler flow is a noninvasive screening technique that uses advanced ultrasound technology toassess resistance to blood flow in the placenta. It evaluatesthe rate and volume of blood flow through the placenta andumbilical cord vessels using ultrasound. This assessment iscommonly used in combination with other diagnostic teststo assess fetal status in intrauterine growth restricted(IUGR) fetuses. Purpose Assesses placental perfusion Used in combination with other diagnostic tests to assessfetal status in intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR)fetuses Not a useful screening tool for determining fetal compro-mise and therefore is not recommended to the generalobstetric population (Harman, 2009). Procedures The woman is assisted into a supine position. Transmission gel and transducer are placed on thewoman's abdomen. Images are obtained of blood flow in the umbilical artery. Interpretation of Results The directed blood flow within the umbilical arteries is calculated using the difference between systolic anddiastolic flow (Gilbert, 2011). As peripheral resistance increases, diastolic flow decreasesand the systolic/diastolic increases. Reversed end-diastolicflow can be seen with severe cases of intrauterine growthrestriction (AAP & ACOG, 2007).Umbilical artery Doppler is considered abnormal if thesystolic/diastolic (S/D) ratio is above the 95th percentilefor gestational age, or a ratio above 3.0, or the end-dias-tolic flow is absent or reversed (Cunningham, Leveno,Blooms, Hauth, Rouse, & Spong, 2010). Advantages Noninvasive Allows for assessment of placental perfusion Risks None Nursing Actions Explain the procedure to the woman and her family. The Doppler test evaluates the blood flow through theplacenta and umbilical cord vessels using ultrasound. Address questions and concerns. Provide comfort measures. Provide emotional support. Schedule appropriate follow-up. Magnetic Resonance ImagingDefinition Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic radio- logical evaluation of tissue and organs from multiple planes.During pregnancy, it is used to visualize maternal and/or fetalstructures for detailed imaging when screening tests indicatepossible abnormalities. It is most commonly performed forsuspected brain abnormality. Purpose Scan tissue and organs. Procedure The woman is instructed to remove all metallic objectsbefore the test. The woman is placed in a supine position with left lateraltilt on the MRI table. The woman's abdominal area is scanned. Interpretation Interpretation of the study is done by a radiologist. Advantages Provides very detailed images of fetal anatomy; particularlyuseful for brain abnormalities and complex abnormalitiesof thorax, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary systems. Risks No known harmful effects Nursing Actions Nurses are involved in the pre- and post-procedure. Explain the procedure to the woman and her family. The MRI is used to see maternal and/or fetal structuresfor detailed pictures. Address questions and concerns.3704_Ch06_115-130 16/09/13 10:08 AM Page 120CHAPTER 6 Antepartal Tests 121 BIOCHEMICAL ASSESSMENT Biochemical assessment involves biological examination andchemical determination. Procedures used to obtain biochem-ical specimens include chorionic villi sampling, amniocente-sis, percutaneous blood sampling, and maternal assays. Morethan 15% of pregnancies are at sufficient risk to villus (CVS) is aspiration of small amount of placental tissue (chorion) for chromosomal, meta-bolic, or DNA testing. This test is used for chromosomalanalysis between 10 and 12 weeks' gestation to detect fetalabnormalities caused by genetic disorders. It tests for meta-bolic disorders such as cystic fibrosis but does not test for neural tube defects (NTDs). Timing Preformed during first or second trimester, ideally at 10-13 weeks' gestation. Procedure The woman is in a supine position or lithotomy positiondepending on route of insertion. A catheter is inserted either transvaginally through thecervix using ultrasonography to guide placement, orabdominally using a needle and ultrasongraphy to guideplacement as well. A small biopsy of chorionic (placental) tissue isremoved. The villi are harvested and cultured for chromosomalanalysis and processed for DNA and enzymatic analysisas indicated (Fig. 6-4).Interpretation of Results Results of chromosomal studies are available within 1 week. Detailed information is provided on specific chromoso-mal abnormality detected. Advantages Can be performed earlier than amniocentesis, but is notrecommended before 10 weeks (AAP & ACOG, 2007) Examination of fetal chromosomes Risks There is a 7% fetal loss rate due to bleeding, infection,and rupture of membranes. 10% of women experience some bleeding after the procedure. Nursing Actions Review the procedure with the woman and her family.This test obtains amniotic fluid to test for fetal abnor-malities caused by genetic problems. Instruct the woman in breathing and relaxation techniques she can use during the procedure. Assist the woman into the proper position.Lithotomy for transvaginal aspiration Supine for transabdominal aspiration Provide comfort measures. Provide emotional support. Recognize anxiety related to test results. Label specimens. Assess fetal and maternal well-being post-procedure.Fetal heart rate is auscultated twice in 30 minutes. Instruct the woman to report abdominal pain or cramp-ing, leaking of fluid, bleeding, fever, or chills to the careprovider. Administer RhoGAM to Rh-negative women post-procedure as per order to prevent antibody formation in Rh-negative women. AmniocentesisDefinition Amniocentesis is a diagnostic procedure in which a needle is inserted through the maternal abdominal wall into theuterine cavity to obtain amniotic fluid. It is commonly per-formed for genetic testing, assessment of fetal lung maturity,and assessment of hemolytic disease in fetus or for intrauter-ine infection. Risk factors for fetal genetic disorders include advanced maternal age (older than 35 years of age), history of geneticdisorders, positive screening test such as a positive alpha-fetoprotein, and known or suspected hemolytic disease inthe fetus. Timing Usually preformed Page 121UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 122 Procedure Detailed ultrasound is performed to take fetal measurementsand locate the placenta to choose a site for needle insertion. A needle is inserted transabdominally into the uterine cavity using ultrasonography to guide placement (Fig. 6-5). Amniotic fluid is obtained. Interpretation of Results Amniocentesis has an accuracy rate of 99% (Gilbert, 2011). Amniotic fluid sample is sent to a lab for cell growth, andresults of chromosomal studies are available within 2 weeks. Elevated bilirubin levels indicate fetal hemolytic disease. A positive culture indicates infection. If the purpose of the test is to determine fetal lung matu-rity, lecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), as follows (Torgerson, 2011):L:S ratio >2:1 indicates fetal lung maturity. L:S ratio <2:1 indicates fetal lung immaturity in increasedrisk of respiratory distress syndrome. Positive PG indicates fetal lung maturity. Negative PG indicates immature fetal lungs. A LBC of 50,000/L is highly indicative of fetal lungmaturity. A LBC of 15,000/L highly indicative of fetal lungimmaturity. LBC results can be hindered by the presence of meconium,vaginal bleeding, vaginal mucous, or hydramnios. Advantages Examines fetal chromosomes for genetic disorders Direct examination of biochemical specimens Risks Less than 1% fetal loss rate after 15 weeks' gestation;increases to 2%-5% earlier in gestation (AAP & ACOG, 2007) Trauma to the fetus or placentaBleeding Preterm labor Maternal infection Rh sensitization from fetal blood into maternal circulation Nursing Actions Review the procedure with the woman and assure herthat precautions are followed during the procedure with ultrasound visualization of fetus to avoid fetal orplacental injury (Leeuwen, Kranpitz, & Smith, 2006). Explain that in the amniocentesis procedure a needle isinserted through the abdomen into the womb to obtainamniotic fluid for testing. Explain that during needle aspiration discomfort will beminimized with the use of a local anesthetic. Explain that a full bladder may be required for ultrasoundvisualization if the woman is less than 20 weeks' gestation. Instruct the woman in breathing and relaxation tech-niques she can use during the procedure. Provide comfort measures. Provide emotional support. Recognize anxiety related to test results. Prep abdomen with an antiseptic such as betadine if indicated. Label specimens. Assess fetal and maternal well-being post-procedure,monitoring and evaluating the FHR. Instruct the woman to report abdominal pain or cramp-ing, leaking of fluid, bleeding, decreased fetal movement,fever, or chills to the care provider. Instruct woman not to lift anything heavy for 2 days. Administer Rho(D) immune globulin (RhoGAM) toRh-negative women post-procedure as per order to pre-vent antibody formation in the Rh-negative women. Delta OD 450Definition Delta OD 450 is a diagnostic evaluation of amniotic fluid obtained via amniocentesis to predict life-threatening anemiain the fetus during the second and third trimester. This test isoften done when alloimmunization exists, due to the increaserisk for severe fetal anemia from RBC hemolysis. Studieshave determined that Umbilical Artery Doppler Flow is asafer option in the management of RH-alloimmunized preg-nancies than Delta OD 450 (Oepkes et al., 2006). UmbilicalArtery Doppler Flow is a non-invasive procedure which canmeasure the peak velocity of systolic blood flow in the middlecerebral artery of the fetus, and therefore does not involve therisks associated with amniocentesis. Timing Second and third trimester Procedure Amniotic fluid is collected via amniocentesis and used ina lab to determine whether there is a deviation of opticaldensity (OD) at 45 nm. Ultrasound guide Uterine 122CHAPTER 6 Antepartal Tests 123 Advantages Early evaluation and detection leads to early intervention,including fetal intrauterine transfusion, to increasechances of fetal survival. Risks Membrane rupture Infection Worsening sensitization Fetal loss Nursing Actions See amniocentesis above. Fetal Blood Sampling/Percutaneous Umbilical Blood SamplingDefinition Fetal blood sampling/percutaneous umbilical blood sam-pling (PUBS), or cordocentesis, is the removal of fetal blood from the umbilical cord. The blood is used to test for meta-bolic and hematological disorders, fetal infection, and fetalkaryotyping. It can also be used for fetal therapies such as redblood cell and platelet transfusions. Timing Usually used after ultrasound has detected an anomaly inthe fetus. May be done as early as 11 weeks but is generally done in the second trimester to evaluate results of potentialdiagnoses and make further recommendations for medicalmanagement if necessary (Gilbert, 2011). Procedure A needle is inserted into the umbilical vein at or near pla-cental origin and a small sample of fetal blood is aspirated(Fig. 6-6). Ultrasound is used to guide the needle. Interpretation of Results Results are usually available within 48 hours. Interpretation of studies is based on the indication for theprocedure. Biochemical testing on the blood may include a completeblood count with a differential analysis, anti-1 and anti-Icold agglutinin, \u00df-hCG, factors IX and VIIIC, and AFPlevels (Gilbert, 2011). Advantages Direct examination of fetal blood sample Risks Complications are similar to those for amniocentesisand include cord vessel bleeding or hematomas, maternal-fetal hemorrhage, fetal bradycardia, and risk for infection. The overall procedure-related fetal death rate is 1.4% butvaries depending on induction (Cunningham et al., 2010).Nursing Actions Nurses may be involved in the pre- and post-procedure. Explain the procedure to the woman and her family.During PUBS fetal blood is removed from the umbilicalcord. Address questions and concerns. Position client in a lateral or wedged position to avoidsupine hypotension during fetal monitoring tests. Have terbutaline ready as ordered in case uterine contrac-tions occur during procedure (Torgersen, 2011). Assess fetal well-being post-procedure for 1-2 hours viaexternal fetal monitoring. Educate patient on how to count fetal movements forwhen she goes home (Gilbert, 2011). MATERNAL ASSAYS Alpha-Fetoprotein/ 1-Fetoprotein/Maternal Serum Alpha-FetoproteinDefinition Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a in the fetal liver, gastrointestinal tract, and yolk sac in early gesta-tion. Assessing for the levels of AFP in the maternal bloodis a screening tool for certain developmental defects in thefetus such as fetal NTDs and ventral abdominal walldefects. Because 95% of NTDs occur in the absence of riskfactors, routine screening is recommended (Cunningham etal., 2010). Timing 15-20 weeks' gestationFigure 6-6 Percutaneous 3704_Ch06_115-130 16/09/13 10:08 AM Page 123UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 124 Procedure Maternal blood is drawn and sent to the lab for analysis. Interpretation of Results Increased levels are associated with defects such asNTDs, anencephaly, omphalocele, and gastroschisis. Decreased levels are associated with trisomy 21 (Downsyndrome). Abnormal findings require additional testing such as amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, or ultrasonography to make a particular diagnosis. Advantages 80%-85% of all open NTDs and open abdominal walldefects and 90% of anencephalies can be detected early in pregnancy (AAP & ACOG, 2007). Risks There is a high false-positive rate (meaning the testresults indicate an abnormality in a normal fetus) thatcan result in increased anxiety for woman and her family related to identification of a potential defect as they wait for results of additional testing. High falsepositives can occur with low birth weight, oligohy-dramnios, multifetal gestation, decreased maternalweight, and underestimated fetal gestational age. False low levels can also occur as a result of fetal death,increased maternal weight, and overestimated fetal gestational age (Gilbert, 2011). Nursing Actions Educate the woman about the screening test. The AFPtest is a maternal blood test that evaluates the levels ofAFP in the maternal blood to screen for certain fetalabnormalities. Support the woman and her family, particularly if resultsare abnormal. Assist in scheduling diagnostic testing when results areabnormal. Provide information on support groups if a NTD occurs. Multiple Marker ScreenDefinition Triple marker screening combines all three chemical markers\u2014AFP, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG),and estriol levels\u2014with maternal age to detect some tri-somies and NTDs. It is sometimes used as an alternative toamniocentesis. Quad screen adds inhibin-A to the triple marker screen to increase detection of trisomy 21 to 80%(Queenan, Hobbins, & Spong, 2005). Timing 15-16 weeks' gestation Procedure Maternal blood is drawn and sent to the lab for analysis. Interpretation Low levels of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP)and unconjugated estriol levels suggest an abnormality. levels are twice as high in pregnan-cies with trisomy 21. Decreased estriol levels are an indicator of NTDs. Advantages 60%-80% of cases of Down syndrome can be identified. 85%-90% of open NTDs are detected. Risks None Nursing Actions Educate the woman about the test. This is a maternalblood test that assesses for the levels of chemicals in thematernal blood to screen for certain developmentalabnormalities. Provide emotional support for the woman and her family. Assist in scheduling additional testing if needed. Provide information on support groups if a NTD occurs. TESTS OF FETAL STATUS AND WELL-BEING The assessment of fetal status is a key component of perinatalcare. A variety of methods are available for ongoing assessmentof fetal well-being during pregnancy (AWHONN, 2008):Daily fetal movement count (kick counts) Non-stress test (NST) Vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) Contraction stress test (CST) Amniotic fluid index (AFI) Biophysical profile (BPP)The goal of fetal testing is to reduce the number of prevent- able stillbirths and to avoid unnecessary interventions. The pur-pose of antenatal testing is to validate fetal well-being or identifyfetal hypoxemia and to intervene before permanent injury ordeath occurs (AWHONN, 2008; Torgerson, 2011). In mostclinical situations a normal test result indicates that intrauterinefetal death is highly unlikely in the next 7 days and is highlyreassuring (AAP & ACOG, 2007). In most pregnancies, when indicated, testing begins by 32-34 weeks (Cunninghamet al., 2010). Daily Fetal Movement CountDefinition Daily fetal movement count (kick counts) is a maternal assessment of fetal movement by counting fetal movements in a period of time to identify potentially hypoxic fetuses.Maternal perception of fetal movement was one of the earliestand easiest tests of fetal well-being and remains an essentialassessment of fetal health. Fetal activity is diminished in thecompromised fetus, and cessation of fetal movement has beendocumented preceding fetal demise (AWHONN, 2008). 3704_Ch06_115-130 16/09/13 10:08 AM Page 124CHAPTER 6 Antepartal Tests 125 Timing Kick counts have been proposed as a primary method of fetal surveillance for all pregnancies after 28 weeks'gestation. However, many women may begin feeling fetalmovement around 16-20 weeks (Gilbert, 2011). Procedure The pregnant woman is instructed to palpate herabdomen and track fetal movements daily for 1-2 hours. Interpretation In the 2-hour approach, maternal perception of 10 dis-tinct fetal movements within 2 hours is considered nor-mal and reassuring; once movement is achieved, countscan be discontinued for the day. In the 1-hour approach, the count is considered reassur-ing if it equals or exceeds the established baseline; in general 4 movements in 1 hour is reassuring. Reports of decreased fetal movement should be reportedto the provider and is an indication for further fetalassessment such as a non-stress test or biophysical profile. Fewer than four fetal movements in 2 hours should bereported to provider (Barron, 2014). Advantages Done by pregnant women Inexpensive, reassuring, and relatively easily taught topregnant women Risks None Nursing Actions Teach the woman how to do kick counts and provide ameans to record them. Instruct the woman to lie on herside while counting movements. Explain that maternalassessment of fetal movement by counting fetal move-ments is an important evaluation of fetal well-being. If fetal movement is decreased, the woman should beinstructed to have something to eat, rest, and focus onfetal movement for 1 hour. Four movements in 1 hour isconsidered reassuring. Instruct the woman to report decreased fetal movementbelow normal, as decreasing fetal movements are an indi-cation for further assessment by care providers. Non-Stress TestDefinition The non-stress test (NST) is a screening tool that uses elec- tronic fetal monitoring (EFM) to assess fetal condition or well-being (Fig. 6-7). The heart rate of a physiologically normal fetuswith adequate oxygenation and intact autonomic nervous sys-tem accelerates in response to movement (AWHONN, 2008).The NST records accelerations in the fetal heart rate (FHR) in relation to fetal activity. It is the most widely acceptedmethod of evaluating fetal status, particularly for high-risk preg-nant women with complications such as hypertension, diabetes,multiple gestation, trauma and/or bleeding, woman's report oflack of fetal movement, and placental abnormalities. Procedure The FHR is monitored with the external FHR transduceruntil reactive (up to 40 minutes), while running a FHRcontraction strip for interpretation. Monitor FHR and fetal activity for 20-30 minutes(placement of EFM and interpretation of EFM aredescribed in Chapter 9). Interpretation The NST is considered reactive when the FHR increases15 beats above baseline for 15 seconds twice or more in20 minutes. In fetuses less than 32 weeks' gestation two accelera-tions peaking at least 10 bpm above baseline and lasting 10 seconds in a 20-minute period is reactive(AWHONN, 2008). Nonreactive NST is one without sufficient FHR accel-erations in 40 minutes and should be followed up withfurther testing such as a BPP (AAP & ACOG, 2007). Presence of repetitive variable decelerations that are >30 seconds requires further assessment of amniotic fluid (Cunningham et al., 2010). Advantages Noninvasive, easily performed, and reliable indicator offetal well-being Risks No indicated risks NST has a high false-positive rate, 80%-90%, but doeshave a low false-negative rate of less than 1% (APA &ACOG, 2007). Figure 6-7 Monitoring for 16/09/13 10:08 AM Page 125UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 126 Nursing Actions Explain the procedure to the woman and her family. The NST uses electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) toassess fetal well-being. Have the patient void prior to the procedure and lie in asemi-Fowler's or lateral position. Provide comfort measures. Provide emotional support. Interpret FHR and accelerations; report results to thecare provider. Document the date and time the test was started, thepatient's name, the reason for the test, and the maternalvital signs. Schedule appropriate follow-up; the typical interval fortesting is biweekly or weekly depending on indication. Vibroacoustic StimulationDefinition Vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) is a screening tool that uses auditory stimulation (using an artificial larynx) to assess fetal well-being with EFM when NST is nonreac- tive. Vibroacoustic stimulation may be effective in eliciting a change in fetal behavior, fetal startle movements, andincreased FHR variability. VAS is only used when the base-line rate is determined to be within normal limits. Whendeceleration or bradycardia is present, VAS is not an appro-priate intervention (Gilbert, 2011). Procedure VAS is conducted by activating an artificial larynx on the maternal abdomen near the fetal head for 1 second in conjunction with the NST. This can be repeated at 1-minute intervals up to 3 times. Interpretation The NST using VAS is considered reactive when theFHR increases 15 beats above baseline for 15 secondstwice in 20 minutes. Advantages Using VAS to stimulate the fetus has reduced the incidence of nonreactive NSTs and reduced the timerequired to conduct NSTs. Risks No adverse effects reported Not recommended as a routine procedure in high-riskpregnancies Nursing Actions Explain the procedure to the woman and her family. The test uses a buzzer (in auditory stimulation) to assessfetal well-being. Provide comfort measures. Provide emotional support.Interpret FHR and accelerations and conduct VASappropriately. Report results to physician or midwife and document. Schedule appropriate follow-up. Contraction Stress TestDefinition The contraction stress test (CST) is a screening tool to assess fetal well-being and uteroplacental function with EFM inwomen with nonreactive NST at term gestation. The purposeof the CST is to identify a fetus that is at risk for compromisethrough observation of the fetal response to intermittentreduction in utero placental blood flow associated with stim-ulated uterine contractions (UCs) (AWHONN, 2008). Procedure Monitor FHR and fetal activity for 20 minutes. If no spontaneous UCs, contractions can be initiated in some women by having them brush the nipples for 10 minutes. If nipple stimulation is unsuccessful, UCs can be stimu-lated with oxytocin via IV until 3 UCs in 10-20 minuteslasting 40 seconds occur. (Placement of EFM and inter-pretation of EFM are described in Chapter 9.) Interpretation The CST is considered negative or normal when thereare no significant variable decelerations or no late decel-erations in a 10-minute strip with 3 UCs > 40 secondsassessed with moderate variability. The CST is positive where there are late decelerations of FHR with 50% of UCs usually assessed with minimalor absent variability. A positive result has been associated with an increased rateof fetal death, fetal growth restriction, lower 5-minuteApgar scores, cesarean section, and the need for neonatalresuscitation due to neonatal depression (Harman, 2009).This requires further testing such as BPP. The CST is equivocal or suspicious when there are inter-mittent late or variable decelerations, and further testingmay be done or the test repeated in 24 hours. Advantages Negative CSTs are associated with good fetal outcomes. Risks CST has a high false-positive rate which can result inunnecessary intervention. Cannot be used with women who have a contraindicationfor uterine activity. Nursing Actions Explain the procedure to the woman and her family. TheCST stimulates contractions to evaluate fetal reaction tothe stress of contractions. Have patient void before testing. Position patient in a semi-Fowler's position.3704_Ch06_115-130 16/09/13 10:08 AM Page 126CHAPTER 6 Antepartal Tests 127 Monitor vitals before and every 15 minutes during the test. Provide comfort measures. Provide emotional support. Correctly interpret FHR and contractions. Safely administer oxytocin (i.e., avoid uterine tachysystole).Uterine tachysystole is defined as more than five uterinecontractions in 10 minutes, fewer than 60 seconds betweencontractions, or a contraction greater than 90 seconds witha late deceleration occurring (Gilbert, 2011). Recognize adverse effects of oxytocin. Schedule appropriate follow-up. Amniotic Fluid IndexDefinition The amniotic fluid index (AFI) is a screening tool that mea - sures the volume of amniotic fluid with ultrasound to assessfetal well-being and placental function. The amniotic fluidlevel is based on fetal urine production, which is the predom-inate source of amniotic fluid and is directly dependent onrenal (Queenan, Hobbins, & Spong, 2005). In pro-longed fetal hypoxemia, blood is shunted away from fetal kid-neys to other vital organs. Persistent decreased blood flow tothe fetal kidneys results in reduction of amniotic fluid produc-tion and oligohydramnios. In conjunction with NST, AFI isa strong indicator of fetal status, as it is accurate in detectingfetal hypoxia. Procedure Ultrasound measurement of pockets of amniotic fluid infour quadrants of the uterine cavity via ultrasound. Interpretation of Results Average measurement in pregnancy is 8-24 cm(Cunningham et al., 2010). Abnormal AFI is below 5 cm. An AFI 5 cm is indica- tive of oligohydramnios. Oligohydramnios is associated with increased prenatal mortality and a need for closematernal and fetal monitoring. Represented graphically: decreased uteroplacental perfusion decreased fetal renal blood flow decreased urine production oligohydramnios An AFI above 24 cm is polyhydramnios, which may indicate fetal malformation such as NTDs, obstruction of fetal gastrointestinal tract, or fetal hydrops. Advantages AFI is a reflection of placental function and perfusion to the fetus as well as overall fetal condition. Risks None Nursing Actions Explain the procedure to the woman and her family.

Biophysical ProfileDefinition The biophysical profile (BPP/BPA) is an ultrasound assess- ment of fetal status along with an NST. It involves evaluationof fetal status through ultrasound observation of various fetalreflex activities that are central nervous system (CNS) con-trolled and sensitive to fetal hypoxia. If fetal oxygen consump-tion is reduced, the immediate fetal response is reduction ofactivity regulated by the CNS. The BPP includes assessmentof fetal breathing movement, gross body movement, fetal tone,amniotic fluid volume, and heart rate reactivity. The BPP pro-vides improved prognostic information because physiologicalparameters associated with chronic and acute hypoxia are eval-uated. It is indicated in pregnancies involving increased risk offetal hypoxia and placental insufficiency such as maternal dia-betes and hypertension. Some controversy exists related to thistest as a Cochrane Review concluded that available evidencefrom randomized clinical trials provides no support for the useof BPP as a test of fetal well-being in high-risk pregnancies(Alfirevic & Neilson, 2006). Procedure BPP consists of an NST with the addition of 30 minutesof ultrasound observation for four indicators: fetalbreathing movements, fetal movement, fetal tone, andmeasurement of amniotic fluid.Assess fetal breathing movements: One or more episodes ofrhythmic breathing movements of 30 seconds or movementwithin 30 minutes is expected. Assess fetal movement: Three or more discrete body or limbmovements in 30 minutes are expected. Assess fetal tone: One or more fetal extremity extensionwith return to fetal flexion or opening and closing of thehand is expected. Assess amniotic fluid volume: A pocket of amniotic fluidthat measures at least 2 cm in two planes perpendicular to each other is expected. Interpretation A score of 2 (present) or 0 (absent) is assigned to each ofthe five components. A total score of 8/10 is reassuring. A score of 6/10 is equivocal and may indicate the needfor delivery depending on gestational age. A score of 4/10 means delivery is recommended becauseof a strong correlation with chronic asphyxia (AAP &ACOG, 2007). A score of 2/10 or less prompts immediate delivery. Fetal activity decreases or stops to reduce energy and oxy-gen consumption as fetal hypoxemia worsens. Decreasedactivity occurs in reverse order of normal development.3704_Ch06_115-130 16/09/13 10:08 AM Page 127UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 128 Fetal activities that appear earliest in pregnancy (tone andmovement) are usually the last to cease, and activities thatare the last to develop are usually the first to be dimin-ished (FHR variability).

Schedule appropriate follow-up; the typical interval fortesting is 1 week but for specific pregnancy complicationsmay be biweekly. Modified Biophysical ProfileDefinition The modified BPP combines an NST as an indicator of short-term fetal well-being and AFI as an indicator of long-term placental function to evaluate fetal well-being. It is indi-cated in high-risk pregnancy related to maternal conditions orpregnancy-related conditions (see Table 6-1). Procedure A modified BPP combines the use of an NST with an AFI. Interpretation A modified BPP is considered normal when the NST isreactive and the AFI is greater than 5 cm. An AFI lessthan or equal to 5 is indicative of oligohydramnios.Oligohydramnios is associated with increased perinatalmortality, and decreased amniotic fluid may be a reflec-tion of acute or chronic fetal asphyxia (Feinstein,Torgesen, & Atterbury, 2003).

The nature of perinatal nursing is unpredictable, and preg- nancy complications can arise abruptly, resulting in rapiddeterioration of maternal and fetal status. It is imperative thatnurses understand the underlying physiological mechanismsof pregnancy, the impact of complications on maternal andfetal well-being, and current interventions to optimize mater-nal and fetal outcomes. GESTATIONAL COMPLICATIONS Although most pregnant women experience a normal preg-nancy, various complications can develop during pregnancythat affect maternal and fetal well-being. When womenexperience pregnancy complications, astute assessment, rapidintervention, and a collaborative team approach are essentialto optimize maternal and neonatal outcomes. In this section,complications related to pregnancy are presented along withthe physiological and pathological basis for the most com-mon complications of pregnancy. Nursing care and appropri-ate management are discussed. Preterm Labor and Birth Preterm labor (PTL) is the onset of labor before 37 weeks'gestation. Preterm birth (PTB) refers to gestational age at birth of less than 37 weeks. According to an Institute ofMedicine report (2007), preterm birth is a complex cluster ofproblems with a set of overlapping factors of influence. Itscauses may include individual level behavioral and psychoso-cial factors, neighborhood characteristics, environmentalexposures, medical conditions, infertility treatments, biologicalfactors, and genetics. Many of these factors occur in combina-tion, particularly in those who are socioeconomically disadvan-taged or who are members of racial and ethnic minority groups(Berhman & Stith Butler, 2007). Most preterm births are a result of spontaneous preterm labor; however, between 20% and 25% of preterm necessary, and3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:44 AM Page 131UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 132 indicated for problems such as hypertension, preeclampsia,hemorrhage, and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) whereearly delivery would improve either maternal or fetal status. A preterm/premature infant is born after 20 weeks and before 37 completed weeks of gestation (Fig. 7-1). More spe-cific classifications of prematurity include (PeriStats, 2012):Late preterm infant: An infant born between 34 and 36 weeks of gestation Very preterm infant: An infant born before 32 completedweeks of gestation Low birth weight infant (LBW): An infant who weighs less than 2,500 grams at delivery, regardless of gestationalage; among low birth weight infants, two thirds arepreterm. Very low birth weight infant: An infant who weighs lessthan 1,500 grams at birth Extremely low birth weight infant: An infant who weighsless than 1,000 grams at birthDuring the last 20 years, the preterm birth rate has increased more than 28%, from 9.6% in 1983 to 11.0% in 1993to 12.3% in 2003, and to 12.2% (over 500,00 infants per year)in 2009 (Martin, Hamilton, Ventura, Osterman, Kirmeyer,Mathews, & Wilson, 2011; March of Dimes, 2012). Between1999 and 2009, the rate of infants born preterm in the UnitedStates increased more than 3%. Prematurity is the number one cause of neonatal mortality and the number two cause of infant mortality in the UnitedStates. Data indicated hospital charges for premature infantsthat year totaled more than $18 billion in immediate costs of neonatal intensive care and the morbidity associated with pre-maturity, such as respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricularhemorrhages, and necrotizing enterocolitis (March of Dimes,2006b). The annual societal economic cost (medical, education-al, and lost productivity) associated with preterm birth in the United States was over $26 billion. The average first-yearmedical costs, including both inpatient and outpatient care,were about 10 times greater for preterm ($32,325) than for terminfants ($3,325). Long-term sequelae for preterm infants include cerebral palsy, hearing and vision impairment, and chronic lung disease.Long-term costs include not only health care costs but also special education costs for learning problems, costs of develop-mental services, and health care costs for long-term sequelaeassociated with prematurity. The goals of Healthy People 2020and the March of Dimes are to reduce the preterm birth ratefrom 12.2% to 11.4% (March of Dimes, 2012). Pathophysiological Pathways of Preterm Labor Spontaneous preterm birth may be characterized by a syn-drome composed of several components including uterine(preterm labor), chorioamnionic-decidual (premature ruptureof membranes), and cervical (cervical insufficiency) (Owens &Harger, 2007). Yet the specific causes of spontaneous pretermlabor and delivery are largely unknown. Preterm labor is char-acterized as a series of complex interactions of factors. No sin-gle factor acts alone, but multiple factors interact to initiate acascade of events that result in preterm labor and birth (Reedy,2014). The pathways to preterm birth are thought to be mul-ticausal, and contributing factors include (Iams, 2007; Marchof Dimes, 2006a) (Fig. 7-2):Uterine overdistentionProstaglandin can be produced, stimulating the uterus tocontract when overdistended from multiple gestation, orpolyhydramnios, or uterine abnormalities. Decidual activationFrom hemorrhage From fetal-decidual paracrine system From upper genital tract infection Premature activation of the normal physiological initiatorsof labor, activation of the maternal-fetal hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis Inflammation and infection in the decidua, fetal mem-branes, and amniotic fluid are associated with preterm birth.Inflammatory cytokines or bacterial endotoxins can stimu-late prostaglandin release resulting in cervical ripening,contractions, and weakening and rupture of membranes. Psychosocial factors are also hypothesized to contribute to a stress response that results in uterine contractions (UCs). Studiesof chronic and catastrophic stress exposures are suggestive of anassociation between stress and preterm birth (IOM, 2008). Because we do not know what triggers normal labor at term, it is difficult to know what causes preterm labor. Extensiveresearch has been conducted over the past three decades to predict which women are at risk to deliver preterm so thatintensive interventions can be implemented to prevent prema-turity. Risk factors predict only about half the women who willdeliver preterm. Risk Factors for Preterm Labor and Birth Despite its use for decades, risk factor assessment alone has alimited utility for identifying who will deliver preterm (Marchof Dimes, 2011). Fifty percent of women who deliver preterm Figure 7-1 Premature infant in the NICU.3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:44 AM Page 132CHAPTER 7 High-Risk Antepartum Nursing Care 133 have no risk factors. Seventy percent of women who are at risk for preterm delivery go on to deliver at term. Researchindicates it is a complex interplay of multiple risk factors(PeriStats, 2008). A host of behavioral, psychosocial, socio-demographic, and medical/pregnancy conditions, and biological factors areassociated with risk for preterm birth (March of Dimes,2011). The most consistently identified risk factors includea history of preterm birth; for example, the additive riskassociated with multiple prior preterm births is especiallyevident when early preterm births are considered. Womenwith one prior preterm delivery <35 weeks have a 16% recur-rence risk, those with two early preterm deliveries have a41% risk, and those with three prior preterm deliveries havea 67% risk of subsequent preterm birth before 35 weeks(NIH, DHHS, 2008). Common risk factors include (Freda, Patterson, & Wieczorek, 2004; Goldstein, 2007):Prior preterm birth (single most important factor reoc-currence rates of up to 40%) History of second trimester loss History of incompetent cervix Cerclage IVF pregnancy Multiple gestation (50% of twins delivered preterm,90% higher multiples delivered preterm) Uterine/cervical abnormalities, diethylstilbestrol (DES)exposure Hydramnios or oligohydramnios Infection, especially genitourinary infections and peri-odontal disease Premature rupture of membranes Short pregnancy interval (less than 9 months) Pregnancy associated problems such as hypertension, dia-betes, and vaginal bleeding Chronic health problems such as hypertension, diabetes,or clotting disorders Inadequate nutrition, low BMI, low pre-pregnancyweight, or poor weight gain Age younger than 17 or older than 35 years oldLate or no prenatal care Obesity, high BMI, or excessive weight gain Low BMI Working long hours, long periods of standing Ancestry and ethnicityPreterm birth rates are highest for African Americaninfants (17.8% vs. 12.2%) (March of Dimes, 2012). Maternal unmarried status is associated with an increasedrisk of preterm birth as well as low birth weight and smallfor gestational age (Shah, Zao, & Ali, 2011). Preterm birth is more likely in the presence of intimatepartner violence (IPV), mental health issues, substanceabuse, and other psychosocial stressors (March ofDimes, 2011).Maternal exposure to domestic violence is associated withsignificantly increased risk of low birth weight and pretermbirth. Inadequate prenatal care, higher incidences of high-risk behaviors, direct physical trauma, stress, and neglectare postulated mechanisms (Shah & Shah, 2010). Lack of social support Smoking, alcohol, and illicit drug use Lower education and socioeconomic status, povertyMost preterm births (75%) are a result of spontaneous (40%) and/or preterm premature rupture ofmembrane than 20% preterm births are clinically indicated for complications (intentional preterm birth). Prediction and Detection of Preterm Labor Early detection of pregnant women who will give birth pre-maturely has been extensively research since the 1970s withfew definitive findings. No screening methods have beenfound to be consistently effective. Tests for preterm birth prediction include biomarkers for decidual-membrane separation, such as fetal fibronectin; pro-teomics to identify inflammatory activity; and genomics forsusceptibility for preterm birth. Since 1998, cervical length,bacterial vaginosis, and the presence of fetal fibronectin incervicovaginal fluid have been identified as factors mostAbnormal uterine distention \u0081 Uterine contr 2 Antepartal Period 134 strongly linked to risk of spontaneous preterm births (Marchof Dimes, 2011). Uterine contraction monitoring and cervical change has a40% false positive rate. Transvaginal cervical ultrasonographyIn symptomatic women a cervical length of >30 mm reli-ably excludes preterm labor. A cervical length of <20 mm has strong positive predictivevalue. Fetal fibronectin has a low positive predictive value but ahigh negative predictive value, thereby making it a usefultest to predict those women who will NOT deliverpreterm. Risks for the Woman Related to Preterm Labor and Birth Complications related to bed rest and treatment withtocolytics Risks for the Fetus and Newborn Related to PretermLabor and Birth Complications of prematurity and long term sequelaeassociated with prematurity (see Chapter 17) Assessment Findings Criteria for the diagnosis of preterm labor have varied, andthere is not universal agreement on criteria.Persistent uterine contractions (see Critical Component:Diagnosis of Preterm Labor) Dilated to 1 cm markerFetal fibronectin (fFN) is an extracellular matrix pro-tein that acts as glue that attaches the fetal membranesto the underlying uterine decidua (Iams, 2007). It isdetected via immunoassay; a positive test is greater than50 ng/mL. A negative fFN has a high negative predic-tive value (up to 95%) that the woman will not deliverin 7-14 days. It has a poor positive predictive value(25%-40%), which limits its ability to predict womenwho will deliver preterm (Iams, 2007; Simpson &Creehan, 2008). In other words, fFN is better at pre-dicting who will not deliver preterm than who willdeliver preterm.Medical Management Current interventions to stop preterm labor have not beenproven to be effective (Cunningham et al., 2010; Goldstein,2007). The cornerstones of management of preterm labor arestill administration of medications to stop uterine contractionsand bed rest. Although there is little evidence to support thesestrategies and despite recommendations to the contrary(ACOG, 2012), they are still commonly used. Typically man-agement is focused on delaying delivery for several days (optimalis 72 hours) to give glucocorticoids (corticosteroids) time tofacilitate fetal lung maturity. Medical management includes:Tocolytic drugs are medications that are used to suppressuterine contractions in preterm labor. There are no clear\"first-line\" tocolytic drugs to manage preterm labor. Clinicalcircumstances and physician preferences should dictatetreatment (ACOG, 2003). These agents have drawbacksand potential serious adverse effects (Table 7-1). A reviewof evidence on tocolytic therapy revealed a small improve-ment in pregnancy prolongation and that extended use haslittle or no value (Berkman et al., 2003). Tocolytic drugs may prolong pregnancy for 2 to 7 days,which may allow for administration of steroids toimprove fetal lung maturity and the consideration ofmaternal transport to a tertiary care facility. Neither maintenance treatment with tocolytic drugs norrepeated acute tocolysis improve perinatal outcome; neithershould be undertaken as a general practice (ACOG, 2012). Current management now is focused on delaying delivery forseveral days to give corticosteroids time to work and to treatGroup B Streptococcus infections. Using tocolytic drugs to delay delivery for a few days is well documented. However,their impact on decreasing prematurity is yet unproved(Creasy, Resnik, & Iams, 2004). Terbutaline pump therapyhas not been shown to decrease the risk of preterm birth byprolonging pregnancy (Nanda, Cook, Gallo, & Grimes,2002). Bed rest, hydration, and pelvic rest do not appear toimprove the rate of preterm birth and should not be routinelyrecommended (ACOG, 2013; Goldstein, 2007). Despite extensive evidence, bed rest is not effective; bedrest is a widely used first step in the treatment of pretermlabor. Current evidence based on systematic reviews ofresearch on bed rest during pregnancy highlights poten-tial adverse effects on the woman and her family (Maloni,1993, Sosa, Althabe, Beliz\u00e1n, & Bergel, 2004):Muscle atrophy Cardiovascular deconditioning Maternal weight loss Stress for the woman and her family Intravenous hydration is a common strategy to reducepreterm uterine contractions because it increases vascularvolume and may help to decrease contractions. It shouldbe used with caution due to the potential for pulmonaryedema when tocolytic agents are used. There has been noevidence that hydration can avert PTB. Antibiotics are commonly used to treat genital urinaryinfections, but prophylactic antibiotic treatment is not CRITICAL COMPONENT Diagnosis of Preterm Labor The diagnosis of preterm labor is made when the following criteria are met: Gestational age of >20 weeks and <37 weeks Documented regular uterine contractions (UCs) >6/hour and at least one of the following: Rupture of membranes (ROM) Cervical change: Cervix 135TABLE 7-1 COMMON TOCOLYTIC DRUGS PHARMACOLOGY DOSAGE AND MATERNAL EFFECTS NURSING DRUG AND ACTION ADMINISTRATION AND CONTAINDICATIONS FETAL EFFECTS CONSIDERATIONS MAGNESIUM SULFATE(MgSO 4) NaproxenFenoprofenMonitor FHR and UCs.Monitor serum magnesium maternal toxicity respiratoryra te < of pulmonar y edema.

In addition, oral terbutaline should not be used for prevention or any treatment of preterm labor because it has not been shown to be effective and has similar safety concerns. FDA is requiring the addition of a new Boxed Warning and Contraindication to the terbutaline drug labels to warn health care professionals about these risks.

Antibioticsdo not appear to prolong gestation and should be reservedfor group B streptococcal prophylaxis in patients in whomdelivery is imminent (ACOG, 2012). Progesterone supplementation may be useful to prevent preterm birth for women with a history of 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone-caproate at 250 mg/week beginning at 16 weeks to 36weeks of gestation is considered safe (Meis, 2007). It is notrecommended for prophylactic use in multiple gestation. Neonatal neuroprophylaxis with magnesium sul-fate administration is recommended to birth of Rouse, loading bolus and maintenance doseis given to the mother for 12 hours to protect the fetal brainand can be repeated whenever preterm delivery is imminent. Corticosteroid therapy, with antenatal steroids, is currentlyrecommended to women at risk of preterm birth (seeMedication: Corticosteroids). Betamethasone is one ante-natal steroid given to women to accelerate fetal lung matu-rity, thereby decreasing the severity of respiratory distresssyndrome and other complications of prematurity in theneonate. Treatment with antenatal corticosteroids enterocolitis, andinfectious morbidity in the neonate when used between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation (Roberts & Dalziel, 2006).The short-term benefits for babies of less respiratory distressand fewer serious health problems in the first few weeksafter birth support the use of repeat dose(s) of prenatal cor-ticosteroids for women still at risk of preterm birth seven days or more after an initial course. These benefits wereassociated with a small reduction in size at birth. The cur-rent available evidence reassuringly shows no significantharm in early childhood, although no benefit (Crowther,McKinlay, Middleton, & Harding, 2011). If UCs decrease to fewer than five per hour, then womenare often transferred to less acute antenatal units for furtherobservation for several days. If they remain stable, they maybe discharged to home undelivered. Discharge instructionstypically include bed rest or activity restriction, self-moni-toring of uterine activity, and signs and symptoms ofpreterm labor, and may include oral tocolytics or use ofterbutaline pump therapy, but these are no longer com-monly used. There has been no demonstrated benefit tomaintenance tocolytic therapy (Cunningham et al., 2010). Contraindications to treating preterm labor include:Active hemorrhage Severe maternal disease Fetal compromise Chorioamnionitis Fetal death Previable gestation and PPROM with nifedapine, terbutaline use in the previous 4 hours, and evidence of fetal compromise or placentalinsufficiency (ACOG, 2012). Myocardial compromise orcardiac conduction defects, renal disease, and hypertensivedisease are indications for precautionary use. Medication CorticosteroidsBetamethasone Indication: Given to women at 24 and 34 weeks' gestationwith signs of preterm labor or at risk to deliver preterm Action: Stimulate the production of more mature surfac-tant in the fetal lungs to prevent respiratory distress syn-drome in premature infants Adverse reactions: Will raise blood sugar and may requiretemporary insulin coverage to maintain euglycemia in dia-betic women Route and dose: Betamethasone 12 mg IM every 24 hours \u00d72 doses (Deglin & Vallerand, 2009; Goldstein, 2007; ACOG, 2012) Nursing Actions Nurses can provide expertise in directing patient care, stabilizingthe woman and fetus, counseling, coordinating care, and pro-viding patient teaching (Grey, 2006; March of Dimes, 2006b).Immediate care, including assessment and stabilization, occursin labor and delivery. If uterine activity decreases, generally tofewer than 5 UCs/hr, and there is no further cervical change,women are often moved to a less intensive care setting than alabor and delivery unit. Once moved to an antenatal high-riskunit, they are often observed for several days and, if stable, discharged to home undelivered. Immediate care: Review the prenatal record for risk factors and establishgestational age through history and ultrasound (ultrasoundearly in pregnancy is more reliable for gestational age). Assess the woman and fetus for signs and symptoms of:Vaginal and urinary infection Rupture of membranes A sterile speculum exam may be performed to assess forferning of the amniotic f luid. Vaginal bleeding or vaginal discharge Dehydration Assess fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contractions.Report fetal tachycardia or increased uterine contractionsto the health care provider. Obtain vaginal and urine cultures as per orders. Obtain fFN as per orders.This should be obtained before the sterile vaginal exam.Contraindicated if ROM, bleeding, sexual intercourse, orprior collection in the last 24 hours.3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 138CHAPTER 7 High-Risk Antepartum Nursing Care 139 Maintain strict input and output (I&O). Provide oral or IV hydration.May restrict total intake to 3,000 mL/24 hr if on tocolytics. Administer tocolytic agents as per protocol.Monitor for adverse reactions (see Table 7-1). Administer glucocorticoids (betamethasone) as per orders. Position the patient on her side to increase uteroplacentalperfusion and decrease pressure on the maternal inferiorvena cava. Assess vital signs per protocol for tocolytic administered.Report to the provider blood pressure greater than 140/90mm Hg or less than 90/50 mm Hg; heart rate greater than120; temperature greater than 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C). Auscultate lungs for evidence of pulmonary edema. Assess cervical status with a sterile vaginal exam unlesscontraindicated by ROM or bleeding (may be done bythe health care provider to minimize multiple exams);cervical ultrasound may be done (cervical length of lessthan 30 mm is clinically significant). Facilitate a clear understanding of the treatment planand the woman and family's involvement in clinicaldecision making. Notify the care provider of findings.Continuing care once stable: Provide emotional support to the woman by providingopportunities to discuss her feelings. Women often feelguilt that they caused the preterm labor, are concernedfor the infant's health, and have anxiety and sadness overloss of \"normal\" newborn and normal pregnancy laborand delivery (see Critical Component: Nursing Actionsto Promote Adaptation to Pregnancy Complications). Facilitate a clear understanding of the treatment plan and thewoman and family's involvement in clinical decision making. Facilitate consultations with the neonatal staff regardingneonatal survival rates, the anticipated care of the new-born, treatments, complications, and possible long-termdisabilities. The family may be taken on a tour of NICU. Monitor the woman's response to treatment includingFHR baseline and variability and uterine contractions,maternal vital signs, woman's response to tocolytics,increase in vaginal discharge, or ROM. Assessment of women on tocolytics is based on tocolyticused and is detailed in Table 7-1, but generally includesmonitoring of blood pressure and pulse and auscultationof lungs for pulmonary edema. Watch for:Shortness of breath, chest tightness or discomfort, cough,oxygen saturation less than 95%, increased respiratory andheart rates Changes in behavior such as apprehension, anxiety, orrestlessness Encourage a side-lying position to enhance placentalperfusion. Evaluate laboratory reports such as urine and cervicalcultures.White blood cell (WBC) counts are elevated in womenwho have received corticosteroids; therefore, elevatedWBCs are not indicative of infection.Provide ongoing reassurance and explanations to thewoman and her family. Explain the purpose and side effects of the medication. Set short-term goals such as completion of a gestationalweek or milestones. Facilitate family interactions and visiting by having flexi-ble visiting policies. Facilitate a clear understanding of the treatment plan andthe woman's involvement in clinical decision making. Assist with passive limb exercises for women on bed restto decrease muscle deterioration. Assist with hygiene and self-care based on orders for activity. Provide diversional activities that interest the woman. CRITICAL COMPONENT Nursing Activities to Promote Adaptation to Pregnancy Complications Pregnancy complications represent a threat to both the womanand fetus's health and to the emotional well-being of the family.Assessment of emotional status and coping of the entire family isnecessary to provide comprehensive care. Implementing individ-ualized plan of care will facilitate the family's transition during anoften unexpected and frightening experience (Gilbert, 2011).Responses to high-risk pregnancy can include: Anxiety related to unmet needs Threats to self-esteem; the woman may feel she has some-how failed as a woman and/or is failing as a mother. Self-blaming commonly occurs for real or imagined wrongdoing. Frustration often occurs when goals of having a healthypregnancy, a normal birth, and a healthy baby are impededby a pregnancy complication. Conflict can occur when competing and opposing goals arepresented during a high-risk pregnancy. Crisis occurs when the woman and her family are threatenedby a pregnancy complication and an uncertain outcome. Some general nursing actions include: Provide time for the woman and family to express their con-cerns, which may include apprehension, fear, anger, andfrustration. Talking can help them identify, analyze, andunderstand their experience and fears. Provide information repeatedly with patient and signicantother(s) to facilitate a realistic appraisal of events. Explain high-risk conditions, procedures, diagnostic tests,and treatment plan in layman's terms. Provide ongoing updates. Clarify misconceptions. Facilitate referrals related to the condition, which mayinclude social services and chaplain services to enhance fam-ily coping and provide resources. Practice active listening. Self-blaming commonly occurs for real or imagined wrong-doing. Discussing with the woman the underlying causes ofa complication may help to alleviate these feelings. Encourage the woman and her family to participate in decision making and care to provide autonomy. If patient is hospitalized, have flexible guide lines for the family to minimize separation.3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 139UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 140 Discharge Plan All plans should be decided with the woman's and family'sstrengths, needs, and goals in mind and with their participa-tion (March of Dimes, 2006b) (Fig. 7-3). Discharge teachingshould include:Warning signs and how and when to call the provider(Box 7-1) A clear understanding of the treatment plan including useof tocolytics and bed rest/activity restriction (Box 7-2)Programs have demonstrated some improvement in outcomes with nurse phone or home care follow-up (Freda,Patterson, & Wieczorek, 2004; Gilbert, 2007). Typically,women treated for preterm labor are sent home without follow-up at home except for weekly prenatal visits. Topics that should be discussed include (Durham, 1998; Maloni,1998):Effects of activity restriction on the woman and family,including emotional distress (see Evidence-Based Practice:Cochrane Review on Social Support during at-riskPregnancy) Maternal anxiety about the health of the woman and fetus Child care difficulties when on bed rest and plan for at home Financial and career difficulties Physical activity restrictions may include restricted sexualactivity. Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes/Chorioamnionitis Preterm (PPROM) is rup- membranes with a premature gestation (<37 weeks). Itoccurs in about 3% of pregnancies yet is responsible for about30% of all preterm births. Premature rupture of membranesis defined as rupture of the chorioamniotic membranesbefore the onset of labor but at term. Adding to the confu-sion is prolonged rupture of membranes, which is greaterthan 24 hours (PROM). This section focuses on thosewomen that have rupture of membranes preterm (PPROM)because it accounts for approximately one third of prematurebirths. Once the membranes rupture preterm, most womengo into labor within a week. The term latency refers to the time from membrane rupture to delivery. Previable PROMis rupture of membranes (ROM) before 23-24 weeks, Figure 7-3 Nurse doing discharge teaching with high-risk pregnant woman in the hospital.

Premature rupture of membranes is a multifactorial, although choriodecidual, infection and inflammation appearsto be an important factor especially with preterm PROM atearlier gestations (Mercer, 2007). Bacterial infections arethought to weaken the membranes leading to rupture, but inmost cases the cause is unknown. Risk Factors for Preterm PROM Previous preterm PROM or preterm delivery Bleeding during pregnancy Hydramnios Multiple gestation (up to 15% in twins, up to 20% in triplets) Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) Cigarette smoking Risks for the Woman Maternal infection (i.e., chorioamnionitis) Preterm labor and birth Increased rates of cesarean birth Risks for the Fetus and Newborn Fetal or neonatal sepsisThe earlier the fetal gestation at ROM, the greater the riskfor infection The membranes serve as a protective barrier that separates thesterile fetus and fluid from the bacteria-laden vaginal canal. Preterm delivery and complications of prematurity Hypoxia or asphyxia because of umbilical cord compres-sion due to decreased fluid Fetal deformities if preterm PROM before 26 weeks'gestation Assessment Findings Confirmed premature gestational age by prenatal historyand ultrasound Confirmed rupture of membranes with speculum examand positive ferning test Oligohydramnios on ultrasound may be seen but is notdiagnostic. Medical Management The risk of perinatal complications changes drastically withgestational age at membrane rupture. Therefore, a gestationalage-based approach is appropriate for medical management(Mercer, 2007). Medical treatment is aimed at balancing therisks of prematurity and the risks of infections. Unless nearterm gestation premature PROM, management is aimed atprolonging gestation for the woman who is not in labor, notinfected, and not experiencing fetal compromise. Conservativemanagement refers to treatment directed at continuing thepregnancy. According to ACOG (2007), guidelines for man-agement include:Patients with PROM between 34-36 weeks should bemanaged as if they were at term with induction of laborand treatment for group B streptococcal prophylaxis recommended. Patients with PROM before 32 weeks of gestationshould be cared for expectantly until 33 completed weeksof gestation if no maternal or fetal contraindications exist.A 48-hour course of intravenous ampicillin and erythro-mycin followed by 5 days of amoxicillin and erythromycinis recommended during expectant management of pretermPROM remote from term to prolong pregnancy and toreduce infectious and gestational age-dependent neonatalmorbidity. Although antibiotics have been unsuccessful forthe treatment of women with intact membranes, adjunc-tive antibiotic therapy is recommended for women who aremanaged expectantly after preterm PROM. All women with preterm PROM and a viable fetus,including those known to be carriers of group B strepto-cocci and those who give birth before carrier status can bedelineated, should receive intrapartum chemoprophylaxisto prevent vertical transmission of group B streptococciregardless of earlier treatments. A single course of antenatal corticosteroids should beadministered to women with preterm PROM before 32 weeks of gestation to reduce the risks of respiratorydistress syndrome (RDS), perinatal mortality, and othermorbidities. Delivery is recommended when preterm PROM occursat or beyond 34 weeks of gestation. With preterm PROM at 32-33 completed weeks of ges-tation, labor induction may be considered if fetal pul-monary maturity has been documented. Digital cervical examinations should be avoided inpatients with PROM unless they are in active labor orimminent delivery is anticipated. Monitor for infection, labor, and fetal compromise. Assess for fetal lung maturity with LS ratio/phosphatidylglycerol (PG). Administer prophylactic antibiotic therapy to reducematernal and fetal infections. The use of tocolytics is controversial, as is the use of corti-costeroids to accelerate lung maturity, but they appear toimprove outcomes when used before 32 weeks' gestationand in prophylactic 24 weeks' gestation, rec-ommendations include:Patient counseling about risks to fetus Expectant management or induction of labor Group B streptococcal prophylaxis is not recommended. Corticosteroids are not recommended. Antibiotics\u2014there are incomplete data on use in prolong-ing latency. Nursing Actions Assess FHR and uterine contractions. Assess for signs of infection including:Maternal and/or fetal tachycardia Maternal fever 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) or greater3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 141UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 142 Uterine tenderness Malodorous fluid or vaginal discharge Monitor for labor and for fetal compromise. Provide antenatal testing including non-stress tests(NSTs) and biophysical profiles (BPPs). See Critical Component: Nursing Activities to PromoteAdaptation to Pregnancy. The cause of cervical incompetence is unclear, but it is associated with previous cervical trauma such as cervical dila-tion and curettage or cauterization, and abnormal cervicaldevelopment from genetics or diethylstilbestrol (DES) expo-sure in utero, infection and inflammation, and/or local or sys-temic hormonal effects. Risks to the Woman Repeated second trimester or early third trimester births Recurrent pregnancy losses (e.g., spontaneous abortions) Preterm delivery Rupture of membranes/infection Risk to the Fetus and Newborn Preterm birth and consequences of prematurity Assessment Findings Woman reports pelvic pressure and increased mucoidvaginal discharge. Shortened cervical length or funneling of the cervix,although use of ultrasound to diagnose cervical incom-petence is not currently recommended (Cunningham et al., 2010). Obstetrical history of second trimester cervical dilation orfetal losses Live fetus and intact membranes Medical Management Obtain transcervical ultrasound to evaluate cervix forcervical length, and funneling may be done but is notdiagnostic. Cervical cultures for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and othercervical infections Treatment of incompetent cervix is cerclage, which is a type of purse string suture placed cervically to reinforce aweak cervix (Fig. 7-4).Prophylactic cerclage may be placed in women with ahistory of unexplained recurrent painless dilation andsecond trimester birth, generally between 12 and 16 weeks of gestation. Rescue cerclage is placed after the cervix has dilated withno perceived contractions, up to about 24 weeks of gesta-tion (Cunningham et al., 2010). Administer antibiotics or tocolytics, but this has not beendemonstrated to be effective and is controversial in peri-operative period (Owen & Harger, 2007). Remove sutures if membranes rupture, infection occurs,or labor develops. Postoperative Nursing Actions Monitor for uterine activity with palpation. Monitor for vaginal bleeding and leaking of fluid/ruptureof membranes. Monitor for infection.Maternal fever Uterine tenderness Administer tocolytics to suppress uterine activity as perorders.Evidence-Based Practice: Cochrane Review on Social Support During At-Risk Pregnancy Hodnett, E. (2010). Support during pregnancy for women at increased risk of lowbirthweight babies. Cochrane Database Of Systematic Reviews, (6), Accessed November 23, 2012. Programs offering additional support during pregnancy werenot effective in reducing the number of babies born too earlyand babies with low birth weights. Babies born to mothers insocially disadvantaged situations are more likely to be smalland so have health problems. Programs providing emotionalsupport, practical assistance, and advice have been offered inaddition to usual care. Randomized trials of additional support during at-risk preg- nancy by either a professional (social worker, midwife, ornurse) or specially trained layperson, compared to routine care.They defined additional support as some form of emotionalsupport (e.g., counseling, reassurance, sympathetic listening)and information or advice, or both, either in home visits or dur-ing clinic appointments, and could include tangible assistance(e.g., transportation to clinic appointments, assistance withcare of other children at home). The review of 17 randomized controlled trials, involving 12,264 women, found that women who received additionalsupport during pregnancy were less likely to be admitted to thehospital for pregnancy complications and to have a cesareanbirth. However, the additional support did not reduce the like-lihood of giving birth too early or that the baby was smallerthan expected. Authors' ConclusionsPregnant women need the support of caring family mem- bers, friends, and health professionals. While programs whichoffer additional support during pregnancy are unlikely to pre-vent the pregnancy from resulting in a low birth weight orpreterm baby, they may be helpful in reducing the likelihood ofantenatal hospital admission and caesarean birth. Incompetent Cervix Incompetent cervix is classically defined as a mechanical defect in the cervix that results in painless cervical dilation inthe second trimester that can progress to ballooning of themembranes into the vagina and delivery of a premature fetus(Cunningham et al., 2010). When undiagnosed, it can resultin repeated second trimester abortions. Currently there ismore discussion of cervical insufficiency, a process of prema-ture cervical ripening, and the notion of cervical competencyexisting of reproductive performance on a continuum ratherthan all or none, competent versus incompetent (Owen &Harger, 2007).3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 142CHAPTER 7 High-Risk Antepartum Nursing Care 143 Discharge teaching may include teaching patient to:Monitor for signs and symptoms of uterine activity, rup-ture of membranes, bleeding, infection Modify activity and pelvic rest for a week Multiple Gestation Multiple gestation pregnancies are pregnancies with more than one fetus. In 2009, 3.5% of all live births were multiplebirths, and 96.5% were singleton births in the United States.Over 3 decades, the twin birth rate rose 74% (Martin, Hamilton,& Osterman, 2012). An increase in multiple births is relatedto increasing maternal age and greater use of infertility treat-ment. They are more common now because of the use ofovulation-stimulating drugs and assisted reproductive tech-nology (ART). Approximately one third of twins aremonozygotic (from one egg) and two thirds are dizygotic(from two eggs) (Fig. 7-5A & B).Monozygotic twins are from one zygote that divides in the first week of gestation. They are genetically identical andsimilar in appearance and always have the same gender. Dizygotic twins result from fertilization of two eggs. Dizygotic twins may be the same or differing genders. Ifthe fetuses are of differing gender, they are dizygotic andtherefore dichorionic.Either of these processes can be involved in the develop- ment of higher order multiples. The rate of twin specific complications varies in relation to zygocity and chorionicity. There are two principal placentaltypes, monochorionic (one chorion) and dichorionic (two chorions). twins are monochorionic, and it indi-cates monozygotic twins. There are increased rates of perinatalmortality and neurological injury in monochorionic, diamniot-ic twins compared with dichorionic pairs (Fig. 7-5A).Only 1% of monozygotic twins are monoamniotic that share the same amniotic sac. Because they share the samesac, monoamniotic twins have a fetal mortality rate of 50%-60% due to entangling of umbilical cords (Creasy, Resnik,& Iams, 2004) (Fig. 7-5B). Conjoined twins may result from an aberration in the twinning process ascribed toincomplete splitting of an embryo into two separate twins(Cunningham et al., 2010). Although multiple gestations are only about 3% of births in the United States, they contribute disproportionately tomaternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality(Cunningham et al., 2010). Risks for both the fetus and thewoman increase with increased number of fetuses (Creasy,Resnik, & Iams, 2004). Compared with women with twins,women with triplets or higher order multiples (HOM) are at even higher risk of pregnancy related morbidities and mortality (Bowers, 2014). Risks for the Woman Preterm labor and delivery rate is 50% or greater relatedto over distension of the uterus. Premature prolonged rupture of membranes related toover distension of the uterus occurs up to 15% in twinsand up to 20% in triplets. Hypertensive disorders and preeclampsia, which tend todevelop earlier and be more severe, are related to enlargedplacenta. Gestational diabetes often occurs due to physiologicalchanges related to supporting multiple fetuses. Antepartum hemorrhage, abruptio placenta, placentaprevia Anemia related to dilutional anemia Pulmonary edema related to increase cardiac workload Cesarean birth Risks for the Fetus and Newborn Increase in fetal morbidity and mortality due to sharinguterine space and placental circulationIncreased perinatal mortality (threefold higher than insingleton pregnancy) Intrauterine fetal death of one fetus after 20 weeks' gesta-tion increases the risks to the surviving fetus(es). Delivery before term is the major reason for increasedmorbidity and mortality in twins. Rate of preterm delivery(50% higher in twins and >90% higher in multiples; i.e.,triplets or higher). As the number of fetuses increases, theduration of gestation decreases. Increase of low birth weight neonates (20% higher thansingleton) Increase of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) anddiscordant growth (weight of one fetus differs signifi-cantly from the others, usually 25%) related to placen- tal insufficiency.Discordant growth and twin-to-twin transfusions fromsharing a placenta Vascular anastomosis between twins can occur withmonochorionic twin Most of these vascularSuture Cervix Figure 7-4 Cerclage.3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 143UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 144 communications are hemodynamically balanced and donot impact fetal development and perfusion. In twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, blood is trans-fused from donor twin to recipient twin. Twin-to-twintransfusion is due to an imbalance in blood flow throughthe vasculature of the placenta because of arteriovenousanastomosis in the placenta. This results in overperfusionof one twin and can result in circulatory overload andheart failure and underperfusion and anemia of the co-twin.

Increased uterine size, which leads to increased susceptibilityto uterine hypotensive syndrome and PTL and PPROM.This displaces lungs and can result in increased dyspneaand shortness of breath. Increased plasma volume 50%-100% (results in dilutionalanemia) Increased iron-deficiency anemia Increased lower back and ligament pain Increased dermatosis Antepartal Medical Management A woman pregnant with multiple fetuses needs ongoing, fre-quent surveillance of the pregnancy because of the increasedrates of complications, including:Ultrasound for discordant fetal growth and IUGR, aswell as placental sites, dividing membranes, congenitalanomalies, and gender(s) Genetic testing for anomalies Monitor for preterm labor and prevent preterm birth(Cunningham et al., 2010)Corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity are effective inreducing RDS and other complications of prematurity. Studies demonstrate routine use of bed rest does not prolongpregnancy. There is no evidence that tocolytic therapy improves outcomes. Prophylactic cerclage has not been shown to be effective. Monitor for maternal anemia. Fetal surveillance including NST, BPP Monitor for hypertension and preeclampsia. Monitor for hydramnios. Monitor for antepartal hemorrhage. Monitor for intrauterine fetal demise. Nutritional consult Consultation with perinatologist if complications occur Intrapartum Medical Management Many complications of labor and birth are encountered moreoften in multiple gestation deliveries including pretermlabor, uterine contractile dysfunction, abnormal presenta-tion, umbilical cord prolapse, abruption, and post-partumhemorrhage.Type and crossmatch blood immediately available. Ultrasound to confirm placental location and fetal positions Continuous electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) of all fetuses Cesarean birth access should be immediately available,including anesthesia, obstetricians, circulating nurse, andscrub personnel. Agents for hemorrhagic management available, includingmedications and blood products The neonatal team available should be sufficient for allinfants. Birth mode varies with fetal presentations, maternal andfetal health, and preference of the mother and the clini-cian (See Chapter 10):Vaginal birth for both infants Cesarean birth for both Combined vaginal and cesarean birth if first fetus is bornvaginally and second fetus needs to be delivered by cesareanbirth for malpresentation or category II or III fetal heartrate patterns. Triplets and higher multiples are delivered by cesarean birth. Nursing Actions Assess for the following possible complications:Preterm labor, however, uterine contractions as preterm laborcan be more difficult to identify in women pregnant withmultiple gestations because of more discomfort, stretching,and pressure with multiple fetuses, and overdistention of theuterus results in more uterine irritability (Gilbert, 2011). Hypertension or preeclampsia Antepartal hemorrhage Conduct antepartal surveillance including NST, amnioticfluid index (AFI), and BPP. Provide information to the woman and her familyregarding signs and symptoms of preterm labor,preeclampsia, and other possible complications related tomultiple gestations. Facilitate nutritional consult. The woman has anincreased need for iron, calcium, and magnesium to sup-port growth of multiple fetuses. Provide emotional support to the woman and family.The woman and her family often experience an increaseof stress related to fear of pregnancy loss, high-riskpregnancy, and potential complications during preg-nancy and delivery, and anxiety related to caring formore than one infant. Explain plan for PNC and antenatal testing and followup related to multiple gestation. Assess woman's and her partner's response to twin diag-nosis and adaptation to multiple gestationAcknowledge feeling of distress and fear toward pregnancy. Provide family with information on multiple and supportgroups. Provide psychological support appropriate to family'sresponse.3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 145UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 146 Discuss the plan of care for delivery. Cesarean birth isoften recommended for multiples. Facilitate referrals such as perinatologist, neonatologist,and social worker. Hyperemesis Gravidarum Hyperemesis gravidarum is vomiting during pregnancy that is so severe it leads to dehydration, electrolyte, and acid-baseimbalance, starvation ketosis, and weight loss. Hyperemesisappears to be related to rapidly rising serum levels of pregnan-cy related hormones such as chorionic gonadotropin (hCG),progesterone, and estrogen levels. An association has beennoted with H. pylori, but evidence is inconclusive (ACOG, 2004). Other factors may include a psychological componentrelated to ambivalence about the pregnancy, but this is con-troversial. Regardless of the cause, a woman experiencinghyperemesis presents in the clinical situation severely dehy-drated and physically and emotionally debilitated, sometimesin need of hospitalization to manage profound and prolongednausea and vomiting (ACOG, 2004; Gilbert, 2011; Queenan,Hobbins, & Spong, 2005). Assessment Findings Vomiting that may be prolonged, frequent, and severe Weight loss, acetonuria, and ketosis Signs and symptoms of dehydration including:Dry mucous membranes Poor skin turgor Malaise Low blood pressure Medical Management Treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy withvitamin B 6or vitamin B6plus doxylamine is safe and effective should be used for the patient whocannot tolerate oral liquids for a prolonged period or ifclinical signs of dehydration are present. Correction ofketosis and vitamin deficiency should be strongly consid-ered. Dextrose and vitamins, especially thiamine, should be included in the therapy when prolonged vomiting ispresent. In refractory cases of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy,the following medications have been shown to be safe andefficacious in pregnancy: antihistamine H 1receptor block- ers, phenothiazines, and benzamides (ACOG, 2004). Laboratory studies to monitor kidney and liver function Correction of ketosis and vitamin deficiency should bestrongly considered. Dextrose and vitamins, especiallythiamine, should be included in the therapy when pro-longed vomiting is present. Nursing Actions Assess factors that contribute to nausea and vomiting. Reduce or eliminate factors that contribute to nausea andvomiting, such as eliminating odors.Treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy withginger has shown beneficial effects and can be consideredas a nonpharmacological option. In refractory cases of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy,use antiemetics as ordered. Early treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy isrecommended to prevent progression to hyperemesisgravidarum. Provide emotional support. Provide comfort measures such as good oral hygiene. Provide IV hydration with vitamins and electrolytes asper orders. Check weight daily. Monitor I&O and specific gravity of urine to monitorhydration. Monitor nausea and vomiting. Monitor laboratory values for fluid and electrolyteimbalances. Ensure that the woman remains NPO until vomiting iscontrolled, then slowly advance the diet as tolerated. Facilitate nutritional and dietary consult. Determine the woman's food preferences and provide them. Minimizing fluid intake with meals can decrease nauseaand vomiting. Explore complementary therapies to manage hyperemesis,such as traditional Chinese medicine, hypnotherapy, andacupuncture (see Chapter 4). In a recent Cochrane Reviewon nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, 27 trials, with 4041 women, were reviewed covering many interventions,including acupressure, acustimulation, acupuncture, ginger,vitamin B 6, and several antiemetic drugs (Matthews, Dowswell, Haas, Doyle, & O'Math\u00fana, 2010). effectiveness acupressure, the P6 limit-ed. Acupuncture (P6 or traditional) showed no significantbenefit to women in pregnancy. The use of ginger productsmay be helpful to women, but the evidence of effectivenesswas limited and not consistent. There was only limited evi-dence from trials to support the use of pharmacologicalagents including vitamin B 6, and anti-emetic drugs to relieve mild or moderate nausea and vomiting. DIABETES MELLITUS Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disease character- ized by hyperglycemia as a result of limited or no insulinproduction. Type 1 diabetes is a result of autoimmunity of beta cells of the pancreas resulting in absolute insulin deficiencyand is managed with insulin. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and inadequate insulin production. This is the most prevalentform of diabetes, and the rates are increasing as it islinked to increased rates of obesity. It is typically con-trolled with diet, exercise, and oral glycemic agents. Oralhypoglycemic agents are not recommended for use duringpregnancy in type 2 diabetic women (Gilbert, 2011).3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 146CHAPTER 7 High-Risk Antepartum Nursing Care 147 Women with diabetes in pregnancy can be divided intotwo groups: pregestational and gestational diabetics. Diabetes in Pregnancy For many of the complications of pregnancy, and particularlyfor diabetes, medical management is continually under inves-tigation and recommendations for treatment are changing.This chapter provides a general discussion of diabetes in preg-nancy and then considers pregestational diabetes, followed bya discussion of gestational diabetes. Many of the same princi-ples apply in the approach to both conditions. Diabetes inpregnancy is categorized into two groups:Women with diabetes in pregnancy can be divided intotwo groups: pregestational and gestational diabeties. Pregestational diabetes (either type 1 or type 2 diabetes) Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is glucose intolerancethat had not previously been present prior to pregnancy.Some of the normal physiological changes in pregnancy pres- ent challenges for managing diabetes in pregnancy. The physio-logical changes that accompany pregnancy produce a state ofinsulin resistance. To spare glucose for the developing fetus, theplacenta produces several hormones that antagonize insulin:Human placental lactogen Progesterone Growth hormone Corticotropin-releasing hormoneThese hormones shift the primary energy sources to ketones and free fatty acids. Most pregnant women maintain a normal glucose level in pregnancy despite increasing insulin resistance by producingincreased insulin. Whether preexisting or gestational dia-betes, the risk of the perinatal morbidity and mortality for thewoman and neonate are significant. For preexisting or gestational diabetes, the treatment goals are the same and management strategies are similar:Maintain euglycemia control. Minimize complications. Prevent prematurity.Overall, diabetes in pregnancy is a complex health problem that requires a multidisciplinary approach to facilitate ahealthy outcome for both the woman and her baby. Care forwomen with diabetes should begin before conception and forGDM at the time of diagnosis. The goal of preconceptioncare is to maintain the lowest possible glycosylated hemoglo-bin (HbA 1C) without episodes of hypoglycemia, and the care should include (Mattson & Smith, 2011):Assessment and education regarding current diabetesself-management skills Exploration of strategies to improve adherence to treatment regimen Involvement of the woman and her family in the treatment regimen (essential in improving adherence to treatment regimen) Establishment of mutual goals for glycemic controls andself-monitoringPregestational Diabetes The incidence of pregestational diabetes is approximately 1% of all pregnancies and affects 10,000-14,000 womenannually (ACOG, 2005). Women with preexisting pregesta-tional diabetes have a fivefold increase in the incidence ofmajor fetal anomalies of the heart and central nervous system(CNS). The precise mechanism for teratogenesis in diabeticwomen is not well understood but is believed to be related tohyperglycemia and deficiencies in membrane lipids andprostaglandin pathways. The quality of diabetic controlthroughout pregnancy is key in the prevention of major complications of diabetes and the associated risks for diabetes during pregnancy (Gilbert, 2011). Risks for the Woman Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA, 1%), especially in secondtrimester Hypertensive risk) disturbances hyperemesis, nausea,and vomiting of pregnancy Preterm labor (25% risk) Spontaneous abortion (30+% risk) Polyhydramnios/oligohydramnios: Polyhydramniosrelated to fetal anomalies and fetal hyperglycemia (20% risk). Oligohydramnios related to decreased placental perfusion. Cesarean delivery Exacerbation of chronic diabetes-related conditions such as: heart disease, retinopathy, and infection, chorioamnionitis, and postpartumendometritis Induction of labor Risks for the Fetus and Newborn Congenital defects including cardiac, skeletal, neurologi-cal, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal related to maternalhyperglycemia during organogenesis (first weeks ofpregnancy) Growth disturbances, macrosomia related to fetal hyperinsulinemia Hypoglycemia related to fetal hyperinsulinemia Hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia Intrauterine growth restriction related to maternal vascu-lopathy and decreased maternal perfusion Asphyxia related to fetal hyperglycemia and hyperinsu-linemia Respiratory distress syndrome related to delayed fetallung maturity Polycythemia (hematocrit <65%) related to increased to polycythemia and redblood cell breakdown Prematurity because of maternal complications Cardiomyopathy related to maternal hyperglycemia3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 147UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 148 Birth injury related to macrosomia Stillbirth in poorly controlled maternal diabetes, especial-ly after 36 weeks' gestation Assessment Findings Pregestational diabetes, history type 1 or type 2 diabetes Abnormal blood glucose levels HbA1C test to determine the average blood glucose levels over the last 4-8 weeks Cardiac, renal, and ophthalmic function assessment andevaluation Self-Management Comprehensive self-management of diabetes is complex yetessential for successful pregnancy outcomes:Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) by checkingblood glucose levels 4-8 times per day (before and aftermeals and at bedtime) in pregnancy. This is the mostimportant parameter for determining metabolic control.Table 7-2 Self-monitoring of urine ketone. Self-testing is done bytesting the first void specimen for ketones, when bloodglucose level is greater than 200 mg/dL, during maternalillness, and/or when glucose control is altered. Moderateto large amounts of ketones is an indication of inadequatefood intake. Moderate to large amounts of ketone shouldbe reported to care provider. Record keeping of blood glucose levels, food intake,insulin, and activity need to be maintained for appropri-ate management of treatment regimen. Exercise is beneficial for glycemic control and overallwell-being. Generally, exercise three times a week for atleast 20 minutes is recommended, but some contraindica-tions such as hypertension and preeclampsia do exist. Review signs and symptoms of maternal hypoglycemiafor the prevention and management of hypoglycemicepisodes. Patients should keep a source of fast-actingcarbohydrate with them at all times (hard candy or fruit juice). Medical Nutritional Therapy Medical nutritional therapy (MNT) is a cornerstone of dia- betes management for all diabetic women, and the goal is toprovide adequate nutrition, prevent diabetic ketoacidosis, andpromote euglycemia. MNT needs to be individualized andcontinually adjusted based on blood glucose values and insulinregimen and the woman's lifestyle. A registered dietitianshould meet with the woman regularly to assess and reevalu-ate the nutritional needs of the woman. Medical Management Preconception care for women with preexisting diabetes iskey to a successful pregnancy and decreasing risks to thewoman and her fetus. Achieving euglycemic control for 1- 2 months is recommended, achieving a HbA 1C less than 7%. Pregnancies complicated by preexisting diabetes aremanaged by a multidisciplinary team including a perinatol-ogist, diabetes nurse educator, and dietitian. Screening atdiagnosis of pregnancy may include kidney, heart, and thy-roid function and ophthalmic exams. Additional diagnostictesting is typically done related to the fetus, including regular ultrasound examinations, intensive prenatal careschedule, and antenatal testing. The insulin needs of type 1diabetic women increase such that by the end of pregnancy,insulin requirements may be two to three times that of pre-pregnancy levels and may require three or four injections per day of Humulin insulin. Delivery Issues Timing of delivery is a tremendous challenge in pregnan-cies complicated by diabetes. At term, the risk of stillbirthincreases, as does that of macrosomia. In contrast, interven-tion may place the woman at risk for prolonged labor andoperative deliveries. Thus it is necessary for care providersto determine the pregnancies that should be allowed to gointo spontaneous labor and those in need of labor induc-tion. Most guidelines state that diabetes in pregnancy is notan automatic indication for scheduled cesarean delivery(Cunningham et al., 2010). Complicating the issue of when and how to deliver is the fact that infants of diabetic women (IDM) have delayed pul-monary lung maturity and are at risk for respiratory distresssyndrome (RDS). Excess maternal glucose levels result inexcess insulin production by the fetus in utero, which isknown to result in delayed surfactant production thus inter-fering with fetal lung maturity (Mattson & Smith, 2011). The following are general recommendations for intra- partal care:Evaluate fetal lung maturity by checking if amniotic fluidis positive for phosphatidylglycerol, to try to avert RDSin the newborn who is less than 38 weeks' gestation. Thelecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio is not a specific indi-cator for fetal lung maturity in diabetic women. Maintain maternal plasma glucose levels at 70-110 mg/dLduring labor. Administer intravenous insulin when necessary to achievedesired glucose levels. Nursing Actions Extensive teaching is needed for women with diabetes inpregnancy. For type 1 diabetic pregnant women, this meansTABLE 7-2 BLOOD GLUCOSE GOALS TIMING BLOOD 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 148CHAPTER 7 High-Risk Antepartum Nursing Care 149 learning about the effects pregnancy has on the managementof diabetes and the adjustments required to the prior diabeticmanagement regimen. The pregnancy represents new stres-sors and challenges for diabetic women and their families.Women may feel vulnerable and anxious related to theirhealth and that of their fetus.Provide information on:Physiological changes in pregnancy and the impact ondiabetes Changes in insulin requirements during pregnancy withadvancing gestation Assist the woman in arranging for dietary counselingwith a dietitian. Dietary counseling should include the woman's prefer-ences and pregnancy requirements. Review self-monitoring of blood glucose, urine ketones,signs and symptoms of hyper- and hypoglycemic episode,dietary intake, and activity. Emphasize the importance of record keeping of dietaryintake, urine ketones, glucose levels and activity. Instruct the woman to bring records to prenatal appoint-ments to be reviewed by the primary health care provider. Review signs and symptoms, and treatment of hyper-glycemia based on the individualized treatment plan. Review signs and symptoms, and treatment of hypo-glycemia (blood glucose <70 and irritability; somnolence; and pallor (Daley, 2014) Ingest 10-15 g of carbohydrate for blood glucose of 60 mg/dLto raise blood glucose by 30-40 mg/dL in 30 minutes. Review signs and symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis,including:Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, polyuria, polydip-sia, fruity breath, leg cramps, altered mental status, andrapid respirations (Daley, 2014) Care for women admitted to the hospital in diabeticketoacidosis during pregnancy should be provided bynurses with experience in intensive care and obstetrics.The goals of care include fluid resuscitation, restorationof electrolyte balance, reduction of hyperglycemia, andtreatment of underlying cause such as infection(Gilbert, 2010). Provide information on when and how to call the careprovider:Glucose levels greater than 200 mg/dL, moderate ketonesin urine, persistent nausea and vomiting, decreased fetalmovement, and other indicators based on individualizedplan of care (Daley, 2014) Provide information on management of nausea, vomiting,and illness:The glucose level should be checked every 1-2 hours, urineketones checked every 4 hours; insulin should still be givenwith vomiting (Daley, 2014) Provide an expected plan of prenatal care, antenatal tests,and fetal surveillance. Provide an expected plan for labor and delivery.Assist the woman in arranging to meet with a diabeticnurse educator:Ideally, women are referred to a diabetic nurse educator tohelp them to learn self-care management of diabetes and tofacilitate regulation of diabetes in pregnancy. Emphasize that changes in the management plan may benecessary every few weeks due to the physiologicalchanges of pregnancy. Arrange for antenatal testing: Antenatal testing generally starts at 28 weeks' gestationand includes NST and BPP. Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Metabolic changes during pregnancy lower glucose tolerance.Blood glucose levels rise and more insulin is produced inresponse. As the pregnancy develops, insulin demandsincrease. For the majority of pregnant women, this is a nor-mal physiological process. However, some women develop glucose intolerance result- ing in gestational diabetes (Alwan, Tuffnell, & West, 2011).Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with the onset or first recognition inpregnancy (ACOG, 2011; American Diabetes Association[ADA], 2004). This definition applies whether the GDM iscontrolled only with diet and exercise or with insulin as well. When medical nutrition therapy is inadequate to controlglucose in GDM, insulin is required. Approximately 7% ofpregnancies are complicated by GDM, resulting in more than200,000 cases annually (ADA, 2004). Pregnancy is a conditioncharacterized by progressive insulin resistance that beginsmid-pregnancy and progresses throughout the gestation.Insulin resistance during pregnancy stems from a variety offactors, including alterations in growth hormone and cortisolsecretion (insulin antagonists), human placental lactogensecretion (which is produced by the placenta and affects fattyacids and glucose metabolism, promotes lipolysis, and decreas-es glucose uptake), and insulinase secretion (which is producedby the placenta and facilitates metabolism of insulin). In addi-tion, estrogen and progesterone also contribute to a disruptionof the glucose insulin balance. Increased maternal adiposedeposition, decreased exercise, and increased caloric intakealso contribute to this state of relative glucose intolerance(Hoffert Gilmartin, Ural, & Repke, 2008). Two main contributors to insulin resistance are: Increased maternal adiposity Insulin desensitizing hormones produced insulin in the fetus andreduces peripheral uptake of glucose in the woman. It hasbeen proposed that, as the placenta increases in size withincreasing gestation, so does the production of these hor-mones, leading to a progressive insulin-resistant state.Women with deficient insulin secretory capacity developGDM. Because maternal insulin does not cross the placenta,the fetus is exposed to maternal hyperglycemia and in3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 149UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 150 response the fetus produces more insulin, which promotesgrowth and subsequent macrosomia. The American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends routine screening for all pregnantwomen at 24-28 weeks of gestation, with a nonfasting 1-hour50-g oral glucose tolerance test (ACOG, 2011). A positive testis a result of 130 mg/dL or 140 mg/dL depending on the criteriaused (Griffith & Conway, 2004). For women who test positive,a 3-hour glucose tolerance test is done after the woman ingestsa 100-g glucose load; plasma glucose levels are drawn at 1, 2,and 3 hours post glucose load. If two or more glucose levels are above these thresholds, a diagnosis of GDM is made: fasting (ACOG, 2011). Less stringent criteriahave been proposed and may be used by some institutions orproviders. Risks Factors for GDM No known risk factors are identified in 50% of patientswith GDM. History of fetal macrosomia Strong family history of diabetes Obesity Risks for the Woman Hypoglycemia and DKA Preeclampsia Cesarean birth Development of nongestational diabetes Risks for the Fetus and Newborn Macrosomia is the most common morbidity (15%-45%)(Perkins, Dunn, & Jagasia, 2007).Macrosomia places the fetus at risk for birth injuries suchas brachial plexus injury. Hypoglycemia during the first few hours post-birth Hyperbilirubinemia Shoulder dystocia Respiratory distress syndrome The magnitude of fetal-neonatal complications is propor-tional to the severity of maternal hyperglycemia. Risks of GDM for newborns are similar to risks withpregestational diabetes, except they are not at risk forcongenital anomalies. Risks for newborns born to GDMare similar to the risks for newborns born to pregestation-al diabetic women, except GDM newborns are not at riskfor congenital anomalies. Assessment Findings Abnormal glucose screening results Medical Management GDM may be managed by care providers with consulta-tion and referral as appropriate. For most women with GDM, the condition is controlledwith diet and exercise.Up to 40% of women with GDM may need to be managedwith insulin. Oral hypoglycemic agents may be used, but there is notagreement on their recommended use during pregnancy. Cesarean birth is recommended for estimated fetalweight >4,500 g. Women with GDM need to be monitored for type 2 dia-betes after the birth. About one third of women will haverecurrent GDM in subsequent pregnancies (Griffith &Conway, 2004). Nursing Actions The cornerstone of management of GDM is glycemiccontrol. For women diagnosed during pregnancy withGDM, this means learning many complex skills andmanagement strategies to maintain a healthy pregnancy. Teach the woman to test glucose four times a day, onefasting and three postprandial checks/day (suggested glucose control is to maintain fasting glucose less than 95 mg/dL before meals, and between 120-135 mg/dL after meals) (Hoffert, Gilmartin, Ural, & Repke, 2008). (Fig. 7-6 and Table 7-2) Provide information on effects of elevated glucose ondeveloping fetus and rationale for managing euglycemicglucose levels. Encourage active participation in management and deci-sion making. Teach the woman to monitor fasting ketonuria levels inthe morning. Teach proper self-administration of insulin (site selec-tion, insulin onset, peak, duration, administration). Forthe gestational diabetic, consider that it may be the firstinsulin administration time related to the pregnancy.Unlike for women with preexisting diabetes, this can create a tremendous change in lifestyle. Successful self-administration of insulin requires patience, support and Figure 7-6 Blood glucose levels need to be checked regu- larly for any woman who has diabetes at any time duringpregnancy.3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 150CHAPTER 7 High-Risk Antepartum Nursing Care 151 encouragement, and reassurance by the nurse educator(Kendrick, 2004). Teach the woman signs and symptoms and treatment forhypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and diabetic ketoacidosisoutlined above. Reinforce diet management. The recommended overalldietary ratio is 33%-40% complex carbohydrates, 35%-40% fat, and 20% protein. This calorie distribution willhelp 75%-80% of GDM women become normoglycemic. Reinforce plan of care related to self-management andfetal surveillance. Exercise has been shown to improve glycemic control.The mechanism of this improvement is mostly second-ary to increasing tissue sensitivity to insulin. Walking10-15 minutes after a meal is beneficial and can bemanaged by most pregnant women. Typically exercisingthree or more times a week for at least 15-30 minutesduration is recommended. PREGNANCY HYPERTENSION Hypertension is identified as systolic pressure 140 mm Hg orgreater or diastolic pressure 90 mm Hg or greater. Hypertensivedisorders of pregnancy have a 12%-22% occurrence rate, are themost common complication of pregnancy, and are the secondleading cause of maternal death and contribute to neonatal mor-bidity and mortality. Hypertension is directly responsible for17.6% of maternal deaths in the United States. Hypertensionduring pregnancy has increased more than 50% since 1990(ACOG, 2012; Cunningham et al., 2010; Martin, Hamilton,Ventura, Osterman, Kirmeyer, Mathews, & Wilson, 2011;National High Blood Pressure Education Working Group[NHBPEP], 2000). Hypertensive disorders are classified intofour categories by NHBPEP:Preeclampsia and eclampsia syndrome: Preeclampsia is a systemic disease with hypertension accompanied by pro-teinuria after the 20th week of gestation. Ten percent of all first pregnancies are affected by preeclampsia-eclampsia(Gibson, Carson, & Letterie, 2007). Eclampsia is the onset of convulsions or seizures that cannot be attributedto other causes in a woman with preeclampsia. Preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension:Hypertensive women who develop new-onset proteinuria;proteinuria before the 20th week of gestation; or suddenincrease in proteinuria or BP or platelet count <100,00/Lin women with hypertension and proteinuria before 20 weeks' gestation. Almost 25% of women with chronichypertension develop preeclampsia (Cunningham et al.,2010; Gibson, Carson, & Letterie, 2007). Gestational hypertension: Systolic BP 140/90 for the first time after 20 weeks, without proteinuria. Almost50% of women with gestational hypertension developpreeclampsia syndrome. When the blood pressure increas-es appreciably, it can be a danger to the mother and thefetus. In the United States, gestational hypertension, formerly termed pregnancy-induced hypertension, devel-ops in 5%-6% of all pregnancies (Gibson, Carson, &Letterie, 2007). Final diagnosis is made postpartum. Chronic hypertension: Hypertension (BP 140/90) before conception or before the 20th week of gestation, orhypertension first diagnosed after 20 weeks' gestation thatpersists after 12 weeks postpartum; may put the woman athigh for developing preeclampsia (ACOG, 2012). Evidence-Based Practice: Cochrane for Women with ComplicatedPregnancy Cowswell, T., Middleton, P., & Weeks, A. (2009) Antenatal day care units versushospital admission for women with complicated pregnancy. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2009, Issue 4. Art. No.: CD001803. DOI: 10.1002/ 14651858.CD001803.pub2. The use of antenatal day care units is widely recognized inter-nationally as an alternative for inpatient care for women withpregnancy complications. Antenatal day care units allowwomen with pregnancy complications to spend part or mostof a day at an outpatient setting cared for by nurses and mid-wives with physician and perinatologist consults receivingcomplication-based antenatal testing and assessments andinterventions. Antenatal day care units have been widely usedas an alternative to inpatient care for women with pregnancycomplications including mild and moderate hypertension, andpreterm premature rupture of the membranes. The objective ofthis review is to compare day care units with routine care orhospital admission for women with pregnancy complicationsin terms of maternal and perinatal outcomes, length of hospital stay, acceptability, and costs to women and healthservices providers. Randomized trials comparing antenatal daycare with inpatient hospitalization for women with pregnancycomplications were reviewed. Three trials with a total of 504 women were included. Main ResultsThe findings were that women receiving day care had to make more visits to the hospital as outpatients but were lesslikely to stay in the hospital overnight. Care in day units did notseem to affect other outcomes for mothers and babies orincrease or reduce interventions in labor; although women inone trial were less likely to have their labors induced if theyreceived day care. Two studies provided evidence that womenpreferred day care to hospital admission, and no womenexpressed a preference for more inpatient care; most women inboth groups felt they had received good care and were satisfiedwith it. Outcomes including mode of birth were similar forwomen in both groups, and there were no significant differ-ences in infant birth weight. SummaryRandomized trials to date have been too small to assess the effect of day care units on important clinical outcomes. Therewas, however, some evidence that women preferred day care tohospital admission. These findings may suggest a strategy toreduce hospitalizations for complications during pregnancy inthe United States that extend s beyond brief antenatal testing appointments done in the United States.3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 151UNIT 2 Antepartal Period Preeclampsia is a hypertensive, disorder preg- nancy etiology remains unknown. Preeclampsia is bestdescribed as a pregnancy-specific syndrome of reduced organperfusion secondary to vasospasm and endothelial activation(Cunningham et al., 2010). Although management is evidence-based, preventative measures/screening tools are lacking, treatment remains symp-tomatic, and delivery remains the only cure. Preeclampsia is adisease of pregnancy that ranges from mild to severe and ishypertension accompanied by underlying systemic pathologythat can have severe maternal and fetal impact.The incidence of preeclampsia complicating pregnancy is4% (Martin et al., 2009). Despite extensive research, there is no consensus as to thecause of preeclampsia. The only cure for preeclampsia-eclampsia is delivery ofthe neonate and placenta.The criteria for diagnosis of preeclampsia and preeclamp- sia superimposed on chronic hypertension are presented inCritical Component: Criteria for Diagnosis of Preeclampsia-Eclampsia and Preeclampsia Superimposed on ChronicHypertension. Pathophysiology of Preeclampsia To understand the pathophysiological mechanisms ofpreeclampsia, it is important to review the normal physiolog-ical changes of pregnancy. Normal pregnancy is a vasodilatedstate in which peripheral vascular resistance decreases 25%.Within the first weeks, the woman's blood pressure falls,largely due to a general relaxation of muscles within the bloodvessels. Diastolic blood pressure drops 10 mm Hg at mid-pregnancy and gradually returns to pre-pregnant levels atterm. There is a 50% rise in total blood volume by the end ofthe second trimester, and cardiac output increases 30%-50%.Increased renal blood flow leads to an increased glomerularfiltration rate. Because preeclampsia is a syndrome of reducedorgan perfusion secondary to vasospasm and endothelial acti-vation, the physiological changes that predispose women topreeclampsia also have an effect on other organs/systems suchas the hepatic system, renal system, coagulation system, cen-tral nervous system, eyes, fluid and electrolytes, and pul-monary system (Fig. 7-7).In preeclampsia there is an increase in microvascular fatdeposition within the liver, which is proposed as onecause of epigastric pain. Liver damage may be mild ormay progress to HELLP syndrome (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelets). Hepatic involvement can lead to periportal hemorrhagic necrosis in the liverthat can cause a subcapsular hematoma, which can resultin right upper quadrant pain or epigastric pain and maysignal worsening preeclampsia and reducerenal flow and glomerular filtration rate (NHBPEP,2000). Protein is excreted in the urine. Uric acid, creatinine,and calcium clearance are decreased and oliguria develops as the condition worsens. Oliguria is a sign of severepreeclampsia and kidney damage. The coagulation system is activated in preeclampsia andthrombocytopenia occurs, possibly due to increasedplatelet aggregation and deposition at sites of endothelialdamage, activating the clotting cascade. A platelet countbelow 100,000 cells/mm 3is an indication of severe preeclampsia (NHBPEP, 2000). Endothelial damage to the brain results in fibrin deposi-tion, edema, and cerebral hemorrhage, which may lead to hyperreflexia and severe headaches and can progress to eclampsia (NHBPEP, 2000). Retinal arterial spasms may cause blurring or doublevision, photophobia, or scotoma (NHBPEP, 2000). The leakage of serum protein into extracellular spacesand into urine, by way of damaged capillary walls, Endothelial cell dysfunction Increased permeability AM Page 152CHAPTER 7 High-Risk Antepartum Nursing Care 153 results in decreased serum albumin and tissue edema(NHBPEP, 2000). Pulmonary edema is most commonly caused by volumeoverload related to left ventricular failure as the result ofextremely high vascular resistance (Gilbert, 2007).Risks for the Fetus and Newborn Prematurity delivery may be indicated preterm related todeterioration of maternal status. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) related todecrease uteroplacental perfusion Low birth weight Fetal intolerance to labor because of decrease placentalperfusion Stillbirth Assessment Findings Accurate assessment is essential so that early recognition ofworsening disease will allow for timely intervention that mayimprove maternal and neonatal outcome.Elevated blood pressure: Hypertension with systolic pres-sure 140 mm Hg or greater and diastolic pressure 90 mmHg or greater. Proteinuria is 1+ or greater. Lab values may indicate elevations in liver function tests,diminished kidney function, and altered coagulopathies. Medical Management Once diagnosed, the woman and fetus should be monitoredweekly for indications of worsening condition, as preeclamp-sia can be a progressive disease (see Critical Component:Comparison of Assessment Findings between Mild andSevere Preeclampsia). Women can also present with abruptonset of the disease. Indications of worsening of the diseasefrom mild to severe and severe preeclampsia are treated withhospitalization and evaluation. Antihypertensive drugs areused to control elevated blood pressure, but because the onlycure for preeclampsia is delivery, delivery is indicated in severepreeclampsia, even before term to protect the woman andfetus from severe sequelae. Care in labor and delivery includesuse of magnesium sulfate to prevent seizures. The primary goal in preeclampsia and preeclampsia super- imposed on chronic hypertension is to control the woman'sblood pressure and to prevent seizure activity and cerebralhemorrhage. Medical management includes:Magnesium sulfate, a central nervous system depressant,has been proven to help reduce seizure activity withoutdocumentation of long-term adverse effects to womanand fetus (see Medication: Intravenous Administration of Magnesium Sulfate). Antihypertensive medications are used to control bloodpressure (Box 7-3). Outpatient management for women with mildpreeclampsia is an option if the woman can adhere toactivity restriction, frequent office visits, and antenataltesting, and can monitor blood pressure (see Evidence-Based Practice: Cochrane Review: Antenatal Day CareUnits versus Hospital Admission for Women withComplicated Pregnancy). Delivery of the fetus and placenta is the only \"cure\" forpreeclampsia. There are little data to suggest that any thera-py alters the underlying pathophysiology. Therefore, allCRITICAL COMPONENT Criteria for Diagnosis of Preeclampsia-Eclampsia andPreeclampsia Superimposed on Chronic Hypertension Preeclampsia-Eclampsia Diagnosed after the 20th week of pregnancy. Blood pressure is >140 mm Hg systolic or >90 mm Hg dias-tolic with proteinuria (measurement of 3.0 g [300 mg/dL] ormore of protein in a 24-hour urine collection period). If proteinuria is absent, the diagnosis is suspected ifheadache, visual changes, abdominal pain, or laboratoryabnormalities, specically low platelets or elevated levels ofliver enzymes, are noted along with hypertension. Eclampsia describes grand mal seizure in a preeclampticwoman. Edema occurs in many normal pregnant women and there- fore is no longer considered a clinical marker for preeclampsia.Preeclampsia Superimposed on Chronic Hypertension New-onset proteinuria or an abrupt increase in proteinuria Increase in blood pressure that previously had been undercontrol Changes in laboratory values, specifically platelet alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) Because of poorer prognosis and difficulty in differentiating preeclampsia from an exacerbation of chronic hypertension,over diagnosis of preeclampsia is acceptable. (Report of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on HighBlood Pressure in Pregnancy, 2000) Risk Factors for Preeclampsia/Eclampsia Nulliparity Age younger than 19 or older than 35 years Obesity Multiple gestation Family history of preeclampsia Preexisting hypertension or renal disease Previous preeclampsia or eclampsia Diabetes mellitus Risks for the Woman Cerebral edema/hemorrhage/stroke Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) Pulmonary edema Congestive heart failure Hepatic failure Renal failure Abruptio placenta3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 153UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 154 other interventions are designed to safeguard the motherwhile allowing time for fetal maturity. Although deliverycures preeclampsia, its effect is not immediate and womenremain at risk of continuing problems, including eclampsia,as long as five days postpartum (Peters & Flack, 2004).Nursing Actions Accurate assessment is essential in that early recognitionof worsening disease allows for timely intervention andmay improve maternal and neonatal outcome. Blood pressure should be measured with the woman seat-ed and her arm at heart level, using an appropriate sizedcuff (Fig. 7-8). Placing the woman in a left lateral recum-bent position is no longer recommended to evaluate bloodpressure as it gives an inaccurately low blood pressurereading (Cunningham et al., 2005; NHBPEP, 2000). Administer antihypertensive as per orders (generally forblood pressure >160/110 mm Hg) (see Box 7-3). Administer magnesium sulfate as per orders (see CriticalComponent: Care of the Woman on Magnesium Sulfate). Assess for CNS changes including headache, visualchanges, deep tendon reflexes (DTRs), and clonus (Box 7-4 and Fig. 7-9). Auscultate lung sounds for clarity and monitor the respi-ratory rate. Assess for signs and symptoms of pulmonary edema such as:Shortness of breath, chest tightness or discomfort, cough,oxygen less 95%, increased respiratory is used in se vere preeclampsia; however, caution should be used to prevent rapid decreases in blood pressure. Rapidreduction in maternal blood pressure can decrease uteropla-cental perfusion and decrease oxygen to fetus. Methyldopa (Aldomet): Exact mechanism is unknown; may work on CNS. May take a few days for onset, so this drug is nota first choice in an acute situation. Research shows no long-term effects on fetus. Labetalol (beta blocker): Slows the heart rate and decreases systemic vascular resistance.

Frequency isthen determined by the patient status. Assess DTRs every 2 hours.Monitor strict intake and output. Patients with oliguria or renal diseaseare at risk for toxic levels of magnesium. Monitor serum magnesium levels (therapeutic level is 5-7 mg/dL). Monitor for signs and symptoms ofmagnesium toxicity: Decreased reflexes could be a signof pending respiratory Loss of DTRs respiratoryrate <24 Chest pain EKG changes If toxicity is suspected, discontinuethe infusion and notify the healthcare provider. Respiration difcultyand cardiac arrest can occur withmagnesium levels above 12 mEq/L. Keep calcium gluconate immediate-ly available (1g IV). Maintain seizure precautions and keep resuscitation equipment nearby. Patients receiving IV labetalol for blood pressure control should havecardiac monitoring. Maintain continuous fetal heart rate monitoring Monitor FHR. Alert the neonatal team before delivery of use of magnesium sulfatein labor. Eclampsia Eclampsia is the occurrence of seizure activity in the presence of preeclampsia (Gilbert, 2007). Eclampsia can occur ante-,intra-, or postpartum; about 50% of cases occur antepartum.3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 155UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 156 Women with severe preeclampsia have an increased risk (7%-24%) of developing HELLP syndrome. HELLP maydevelop in women who do not present with the cardinal signs of severe preeclampsia. HELLP may appear at any timeduring the pregnancy in 70% of cases, and the immediatepostpartum period accounts for 30% of cases (Queenan,Hobins, & Spong, 2005). The only definitive treatment isdelivery. However, some women may experience worseningHELLP syndrome over the first 48-hour postpartum period.Women with only some of the laboratory changes are diag-nosed with partial HELLP syndrome. CRITICAL COMPONENT Laboratory Values Indicative of HELLP Syndrome Platelets <100,000/mm3 Liver enzymes (AST, the Woman Abruptio placenta Renal failure Liver hematoma and possible rupture Death Risks for the Fetus and Newborn Preterm birth Death Assessment Findings The woman may present with a complaint of generalmalaise, nausea, and right upper gastric pain. The woman may have unexplained bruising, mucosal bleed-ing, petechiae, and bleeding from injection and IV sites. Assessment findings are related to alternations in labora-tory tests associated with changes in liver function andplatelets (see Critical Component: Laboratory ValuesIndicative of HELLP Syndrome). Medical Management The only definitive cure for HELLP syndrome is immediatedelivery of the fetus and placenta. Resolution of disease isgenerally in 48 hours postpartum. Medical management mayinclude replacement of platelets and is the same as those forthe women with severe preeclampsia (Poole, 2014). Nursing Actions Perform a thorough assessment of the woman related tothe diagnosis of preeclampsia. Evaluate laboratory tests. Notify the physician immediately if HELLP syndrome issuspected or lab values deteriorate.Eclampsia is thought to be triggered by one or more of thefollowing:Cerebral vasospasm Cerebral hemorrhage Cerebral ischemia Cerebral edemaWarning signs of potential eclampsia include: Severe persistent headaches Epigastric pain Nausea and vomiting Hyperreflexia with clonus RestlessnessCare during a seizure includes: Remaining with the patient. Calling for help. Providing for patient safety by assessing airway andbreathing.Lower the head of the bed and turn the woman's head toone side. Anticipate the need for suctioning to decrease the risk ofaspiration. Aspiration is the leading cause of maternal mortality(Poole, 2014). Preventing maternal injury.If possible, a padded tongue blade should be inserted to prevent tongue injury (a tongue blade is still recom-mended by guidelines but not typically used in clinicalpractice). Keep side rails up and padded if possible. Recording the time, length, and type of seizure activity. Notifying the physician.After the seizure, the following is done: Rapidly assess maternal and fetal status. Assess airway; suction if needed. Administer supplemental oxygen: 10 L/min via mask. Ensure IV access. Administer magnesium sulfate per orders. Provide a quiet environment. HELLP Syndrome HELLP syndrome (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelets) is the acronym used to designate the variant changes in laboratory values that can occur as a complicationof severe preeclampsia (see Critical Component: LaboratoryValues Indicative of HELLP Syndrome).Hemolysis is a result of red blood cell destruction as thecells travel through constricted vessels. Elevated liver enzymes result from decreased blood flowand damage to the liver. Low platelets result from platelets aggregating at the site of damaged vascular endothelium thrombocytopenia 10:45 AM Page 156CHAPTER 7 High-Risk Antepartum Nursing Care 157 Administer platelets as per orders. Assessment and management are the same for thewomen diagnosed with HELLP syndrome as for thewomen with severe preeclampsia. Provide the woman and the family with informationregarding HELLP and its treatment. Provide emotional support to the woman and her family,as the woman and family are at risk for increased levels ofanxiety related to diagnosis (Mattson & Smith, 2011). PLACENTAL ABNORMALITIES AND HEMORRHAGIC COMPLICATIONS Major blood loss during pregnancy is a significant contribu-tor to both maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Up to1,000 mL/min of maternal blood flows through the placenta at term. Hemorrhage predisposes a woman to hypo-volemia, anemia, infection, and premature birth. Significantmaternal blood loss can result in decreased perfusion andoxygen to the fetus, resulting in progressive deterioration offetal status and even death (Burke-Sosa, 2014). Placentalabnormalities and hemorrhagic complications of pregnancyare presented in this section. The major causes of antepartumhemorrhage are placenta previa and placental abruption. Thebasic principles with typeof antepartum hemorrhage include: assessment of maternaland fetal condition; prompt maternal resuscitation if this isrequired; and consideration of early delivery if there is evi-dence of fetal distress and if the baby is of sufficient maturityto be potentially capable of survival. Up to 15% of maternalcardiac output up to 1000 mL/min flows through the placen-tal bed at term; unresolved bleeding can result in maternalexsanguination in 8 to 10 minutes (Burke-Sosa, 2014).trimester with development of the lower uterine segment, andwhen uterine contractions dilate the cervix, thereby applyingshearing forces to the placental attachment to the lower seg-ment, or when separation is provoked by vaginal examination(Neilson, 2003). Placenta previa is most often diagnosedbefore the onset of bleeding when ultrasound is performed forother indications (Burke-Sosa, 2014). There are four classifications of placenta previa (Fig. 7-10; Cunningham et al., 2010):Total placenta theinternal placenta previa: The placenta partially covers theinternal cervical os. Marginal placenta previa: The edge of the placenta is atthe margin of the internal cervical os. Low-lying placenta: The placenta is implanted in the loweruterine segment in close proximity to the internal cervical os. Risk Factors for Placenta Previa Endometrial scarringPrevious endometrial vascularizationAdvanced maternal age (>35 years) Diabetes or hypertension Cigarette smoking Uterine anomalies/fibroids/endometritis CRITICAL COMPONENT Vaginal Bleeding A sterile vaginal exam is contraindicated in all pregnant women with extensive vaginal bleeding until the source of bleeding isidentified. If a vaginal exam is performed with a placenta previatorrential, vaginal bleeding could occur related to dislodging ofthe placenta from maternal tissues. Maternal blood loss resultsin decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, which directly impactsoxygen delivery to maternal organs and placental blood flow,thus decreasing oxygen to the fetus. Therefore, the managementof placenta previa is dependent on maternal and fetal status. Placenta Previa The incidence of placenta previa is 1 in 300 deliveries(Cunningham et al., 2010). Placenta previa occurs when the placenta attaches to the lower uterine segment of the uterus,near or over the internal cervical os instead of in the body orfundus of the uterus. The cause is unknown (Gilbert, 2010).Hemorrhage is especially likely to occur during the third Internal os External os Membr anesBlood Internal os External osBlood Membr anes Internal os osBloodA B C Figure 7-10 Classification of placenta previa.

Anemia Potential Rh sensitization as Rh-negative women canbecome sensitized during any antepartum bleeding episode. Risks for the Fetus and Newborn Disruption of uteroplacental blood flow can result in progressive deterioration of fetal status, and the degree of fetal compromise is related to the volume of maternalblood loss (Burke-Sosa, 2014). Blood loss, hypoxia, anoxia, and death (<10%) related tomaternal hemorrhage may occur. Fetal anemia may develop due to maternal blood loss. Neonatal morbidity and mortality is related primarily toprematurity. Assessment Findings The classic presentation of a placenta previa is painlesshemorrhage and fetal malposition. Bleeding usually occurs near the end of the secondtrimester or in the third trimester of pregnancy, and initial bleeding episodes may be slight. The first episode of bleeding is rarely life threatening or a cause of hypovolemic shock. Ultrasound confirms placental location at the cervix. A vaginal exam is contraindicated (see Critical Component:Vaginal Bleeding). Emergency Medical Management Cesarean delivery is necessary when either maternal or fetalstatus is compromised as a result of extensive hemorrhage. Cesarean birth is necessary in practically all women withplacenta previa because the placenta is at the cervix, andlabor and cervical dilation results in placental hemorrhage(Cunningham et al., 2010). Vaginal delivery may be attempted with a low-lying placenta if one can proceed with an emergency cesareanbirth if needed. Placenta previa may be associated with placenta accreta,placenta increta, or placenta percreta (see Chapter 10). Blood is transfused as needed. Medical Management After Stabilization When the maternal and fetal status is stable and bleeding isminimal (<250 mL), prolonging pregnancy and delaying deliv-ery may be possible. This expectant management or conserva-tive management is performed when the fetus is premature toallow for fetal lungs to mature. This typically includes closeobservation and hospitalization. If the woman and fetus remainstable and bleeding stops, discharge home may be consideredwith maternal bed rest, antenatal surveillance, and close proxim-ity to the hospital. A Cochrane Review of clinical trials revealedthere was little evidence of any clear advantage or disadvantageto a policy of home versus hospital care (Neilson, 2003). Nursing Actions Nursing actions are related to maternal fetal status and theamount of vaginal bleeding and include:Perform the initial assessment:Evaluation of color, character, and amount of vaginal bleeding Arrangement for ultrasound to determine placental location Determination of fetal well-being, gestational age, andfetal lung maturity Assessment of vital signs for increased pulse and respiratoryrate and falling blood pressure every 5-15 minutes ifactive bleeding. The woman can have up to a 40% mater-nal blood loss before exhibiting hemorrhagic hemodynamicchanges in the blood pressure and pulse. Notify the physician of any of the following:Onset or increase in vaginal bleeding Blood pressure less than 90/60 mm Hg; pulse less than 60 or more than 120 bpm Respirations less than 14 or more than 26 breaths/min Temperature greater than 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) Urine output less than 30 mL/hr Saturated oxygen less than 95% Decreased level of consciousness Onset or increase in uterine activity Category II or III FHR pattern Assess abdominal pain, uterine tenderness, irritability,and contractions. Initiate bed rest with bathroom privileges. Maintain IV access with large-bore IV in case bloodreplacement therapy is needed. Ensure availability of hold clot and blood components. Assess FHR and UCs and facilitate antenatal testing asordered. Give corticosteroids to accelerate fetal lung maturity, ifindicated. Monitor lab values including CBC, platelets, and clottingstudies. See Critical Component: Nursing Activities to PromoteAdaptation to Pregnancy Complications. Inform the patient and family of maternal and fetal status. Reassure the patient and her family. Anticipate a cesarean birth if patient is unstable. If undelivered and mother is RH negative, administerRhoGAM. Placental Abruption Placental abruption, also referred to as abruptio placentae, is the premature separation of a normally implanted placen-ta. Placental abruption is initiated by hemorrhage into thedecidual basalis. hematoma forms that leads to destruc-tion of the placenta adjacent to it. In some instances spiralarterioles that nourish the decidua and supply blood to the3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 158CHAPTER 7 High-Risk Antepartum Nursing Care 159 placenta rupture. Bleeding into the decidua basalis results in hemorrhage and placental separation (Fig. 7-11 and Table 7-3). The separation may be partial or total and canbe classified as grade 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe)(Gilbert, 2007). Bleeding with placental abruption is almostalways maternal. This is a uniquely dangerous condition for the woman and fetus because of its potentially seriouscomplications. The reported frequency is 1 in 200 deliveries(Cunningham, 2010). Maternal and fetal status determines the management of the pregnancy. The signs and symptoms of abruption can varyconsiderably and are:Severe sudden onset of intense abdominal pain Uterine contractions Mild Gr ade (<15% placenta separ ates with separ ates with concealed hemorrhage) Moder (up to 50% placenta separ ates with apparent hemorrhage) MILD: GRADE 1 MODERATE: GRADE 2 SEVERE: GRADE 3 DEFINITION SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS MATERNAL EFFECTS MATERNAL COMPLICATIONS FETAL/NEONATAL COMPLICATIONS Source: Gilbert (2011).Less than one-sixth of placenta separates prematurely.

This results in uterine ten-derness and abdominal pain. If the separation occurs at the edge of the placenta, thenthe blood usually escapes externally. Signs of hypovolemia Abnormal fetal heart rateThe fetal response to abruptio placenta depends on the volume of blood loss and the extent of uteroplacental insuffi-ciency. Management depends on maternal and fetal status andgestational age. The cause of abruptio placenta is unknown butis associated with risk factors. Risk Factors Previous abruption increases risk up to 15% Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy Abdominal trauma Cocaine, methamphetamine use, and/or cigarette smoking Preterm premature rupture of membranes Thrombophilia Uterine anomalies/fibroids Risks for the Woman Hemorrhagic shock Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) of therelease of thromboplastin into the maternal venous sys-tem triggering DIC Hypoxic damage to organs such as kidneys and liver Postpartum hemorrhage Risks for the Fetus and Newborn Preterm birth Hypoxia, anoxia, neurological injury, and fetal deathrelated to hemorrhage Intrauterine growth restriction Neonatal death (15%) Assessment Findings Maternal assessment findings Vaginal bleeding (but can be concealed hemorrhage) Severe abdominal pain Uterine contractions/tenderness/hypertonus/increasinguterine distention Nausea and vomiting Decreased renal output Remember, during pregnancy signs of shock are usually notuntil 25%-30% of maternal blood loss has occurred. Kleihauer-Betke test in maternal blood may be positiveand indicate the presence of fetal red blood cells.Fetal assessment findings include (see Table 7-3):Tachycardia Bradycardia Category II or II FHR patterns including: loss or vari-ability of FHR, late decelerations, decreasing baseline Emergency Medical Management If abruption results in unstable or deteriorating maternal orfetal status, delivery by cesarean is indicated. Treatmentincludes:Monitoring maternal volume status Restoring blood loss Monitor fetal status Monitoring coagulation status Correcting coagulation defects Expediting delivery Medical Management After Stabilization If the maternal status is stable and the fetus is immature, thenexpectant management would include:Hospitalization Close monitoring of maternal and fetal status including:FHR Maternal bleeding Uterine activity Abdominal pain Vaginal bleeding Maternal laboratory and coagulation studies Corticosteroids may be given to accelerate fetal lungmaturity. Tocolysis may be considered. Nursing Actions Monitor vaginal bleeding (can be concealed hemorrhage). Assess abdominal pain. Palpate the uterus for contractions/tenderness/hypertonus/increasing uterine distension. Manage nausea and vomiting. Assess for decreased renal output. Monitor maternal cardiovascular status for hypotensionand tachycardia. Maintain IV access with a large-bore needle. Administer oxygen at 8-10 L/min by mask. Assess FHR for baseline changes, variability, and periodicchanges indicative of an abnormal FHR. Monitor lab values including CBC and clotting studies. Provide emotional support to the woman and her family. Provide information to the woman and her familyregarding treatment plan and status of their infant. Monitor lab values including CBC, platelets, and clottingstudies. Monitor ultrasound results and umbilical flow Dopplerstudy trends.3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 160CHAPTER 7 High-Risk Antepartum Nursing Care 161 See Critical Component: Nursing Activities to PromoteAdaptation to Pregnancy Complications. Inform the patient and family of maternal and fetal status. Reassure the patient and her family. Anticipate a cesarean birth if patient is unstable. If undelivered and mother is RH negative, administerRhoGAM. Placenta Accreta Placenta accreta is an abnormality of implantation defined by degree of invasion into the uterine wall of trophoblast ofplacenta. Placenta accreta can be diagnosed by ultrasound prenatally but typically is diagnosed after delivery when theplacenta is retained. If the placenta does not separate readily,rapid surgical intervention is needed. Up to 90% of womenlose more than 3,000 mL of blood operatively as a result ofplacenta accreta. A more comprehensive discussion of placentaaccreta is in Chapter 10.Placenta accreta: Invasion of the trophoblast is beyondthe normal boundary (80% of cases). the extendsinto the uterine musculature and can adhere to otherpelvic organs (5% of cases). Abortion Abortion is the spontaneous or elective termination of preg- nancy before 20 weeks' gestation. Abortions are referred to asinduced, elective, therapeutic, and spontaneous. Inducedabortion is the medical or surgical termination of pregnancy before fetal viability. Elective abortion is termination of pregnancy before fetal viability at the request of the womanbut not for reasons of impaired health of the mother or fetaldisease. Termination of pregnancy is done transcervicallythrough dilation of the cervix, then evacuation of the uterusmechanically by curettage, scraping of the contents, or vacu-um. Legally induced abortions have an extremely low com-plication rate. Early medical abortion with medications suchas mifepristone and misoprostol can be highly effective.Therapeutic abortion is termination of pregnancy for serious maternal medical indications or serious fetal anomalies. Thissection focuses on spontaneous abortion as it is associatedwith hemorrhage. Spontaneous abortion (SAB) is abortion occurring with- out medical or mechanical means, also called miscarriage.Hemorrhage in the decidua basilis followed by necrosis ofthe tissue usually accompanies abortion. Approximately10%-30% of pregnancies end in spontaneous abortion. Themajority (80%) occur in the first 12 weeks of gestation andare termed early abortion, and more than half of those are aresult of chromosomal abnormalities (Cunningham et al.,2010). Early spontaneous abortions typically are related to anabnormality of the zygote, embryo, fetus, or at times the placenta. Late spontaneous abortions are between 12 and 20 weeks' gestation.Risk Factors for Spontaneous Abortion Increased parity Increased maternal and paternal age Endocrine abnormalities such as diabetes or luteal phasedefects Drug use or environmental toxins Immunological factors such as autoimmune diseases Infections Systemic disorders Genetic factors Uterine or cervical abnormalities Assessment Findings for Spontaneous Abortion Clinical manifestations and categories are listed in Table 7-4. Uterine bleeding first then cramping abdominal pain in afew hours to several days later Ultrasound confirms diagnosis. Medical Management for Spontaneous Abortion Medical management depends on classification and signs andsymptoms and is presented in Table 7-4. Nursing Actions Related to Care after SpontaneousAbortion Monitor vital signs per protocol and PRN. Monitor bleeding. Review labs. Give RhoGAM if indicated. Follow agency guidelines and facilitate and support thefamily's decisions about disposition of the products ofconception. Assess significance of loss to woman and family(Gilbert, 2011).Acknowledge feeling of sadness, distress, or relief towardpregnancy loss. Give parents' choices and opportunities for decision making. Provide family with information on miscarriage, preg-nancy loss, and support groups. Provide psychological support appropriate to family'sresponse. Discharge teaching related to self-care and warning signsincluding:Teach pericare. Pelvic rest includes no tampons, douching, or sexual inter-course for several weeks. Teach patient to monitor for excessive bleeding and signsand symptoms of infection such as fever and uterine ten-derness or foul-smelling discharge. Teach about diet high in iron and protein for tissue repairand red blood cell replacement. Review plan for follow-up with care provider. Ectopic Pregnancy An ectopic pregnancy develops as a result of the blastocyst implanting somewhere other than the endometrial lining ofthe uterus (Fig. 7-12). The embryo or fetus in an ectopic preg-nancy is absent or stunted, and this is a nonviable pregnancy.3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 161UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 162 TABLE 7-4 CLASSIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF SPONTANEOUS ABORTIONS/MISCARRIAGE CLASSIFICATION DEFINITION MANIFESTATIONS MEDICAL MANAGEMENT THREATENED ABORTION INEVITABLE ABORTION INCOMPLETE ABORTION COMPLETE ABORTION MISSED ABORTION SEPTIC ABORTION RECURRENT SPONTANEOUS ABORTION Sources: Cunningham et al.

Because the vastmajority of ectopic pregnancies are tubal, the focus of this sec-tion is on tubal ectopic pregnancy. In a tubal pregnancy, thetube lacks a submucosal layer, and the fertilized ovum burrowsthrough the epithelium of the tubal wall, tapping into theblood vessels; however, the tubal environment cannot supportthe rapidly proliferating trophoblast. The incidence of tubal pregnancy is increasing and not always reported, but accounts for up to 10% of maternal mor-tality (Cunningham et al., 2010). Hemorrhage is the leadingcause of death in women. Women with tubal pregnancy have3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 162CHAPTER 7 High-Risk Antepartum Nursing Care 163 diverse clinical symptoms that largely depend on whetherthere is a rupture. Risk Factors for Ectopic Pregnancy (in order of risk) Prior tubal damageTubal corrective surgery Tubal sterilization Previous ectopic pregnancies Assisted reproduction Pelvic inflammatory disease Smoking Abdominal adhesions Risks for the Woman Hemorrhage related to rupture of fallopian tube Decreased fertility related to removal of fallopian tube Assessment FindingsAssessment Findings before Tubal Rupture Most women now present prior to tubal rupture, and withadvances in diagnosis and imaging the outcomes have dra-matically improved. Common findings are:Pelvic or abdominal pain (95%) Abnormal bleeding (60%-80%) Abdominal and pelvic tenderness is uncommon. Uterine changes are minimal. Vital signs are stable prior to rupture. Assessment Findings After Tubal Rupture Severe lower abdominal pain Pelvic pain described as sharp, stabbing, or tearing Vertigo or syncope Vital signs become unstable, indicating hypovolemia ifhemorrhage is significant. Pain in neck or shoulder with peritoneal hemorrhagebecause of diaphragmatic irritation. Medical Management Diagnosis generally is made with clinical signs, physicalsymptoms, serial human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) lev-els, transvaginal ultrasonography, serum levels. surgical or medical manage-ment of unruptured ectopic pregnancy. Laparoscopy is preferred surgical method for hemody-namically stable women. Surgical management dependson the location and cause of the ectopic pregnancy, andextent of tissue involvement. Non-surgical medical management of ectopic pregnancymay be indicated in an and hemodynamicallystable woman (ACOG, 2008). Methotrexate, a folic acidantagonist type of chemotherapy agent, will causedissolution of the ectopic mass. Nursing Actions Ensure stabilization of cardiovascular status. Offer explanations and reassurance related to the plan of care.Assess response to diagnosis related to anxiety, fear, guilt. Provide support related to the pregnancy loss. Explain plan for follow-up care, which is determined bytreatment plan, surgical or medical. Give RhoGAM if indicated. Assess significance of loss to woman and family(Gilbert, 2011):Acknowledge feeling of sadness, distress, or relief towardpregnancy loss. Give parents' choices and opportunities for decision making. Provide family with information on pregnancy loss andsupport groups. Provide psychological support appropriate to family'sresponse. Discharge teaching related to self-care and warning signsincluding:Teach patient to monitor for severe abdominal pain, exces-sive bleeding, and signs and symptoms of infection such asfever. Teach about diet high in iron if woman experiences a highestimated blood loss (EBL). Review plan for follow-up with care provider. Teach patient appropriate pain management. Teach patient signs and symptoms that need to be reported,such as severe abdominal pain, fever, bleeding. Special considerations for teaching women treated withmethotrexate (ACOG, 2008):Because methotrexate affects rapidly dividing tissues, gas-trointestinal side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, andstomatitis, are the most common. Therefore, women treat-ed with methotrexate should be advised not to use alcoholand nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It is not unusual for women treated with methotrexate toexperience abdominal pain 2-3 days after administration,presumably from the cytotoxic effect of the drug on the tro-phoblast tissue, causing tubal abortion. Gestational Trophoblastic Disease The term gestational trophoblastic disease refers to a spec- trum of placental related tumors. Gestational trophoblasticdisease is categorized into molar and nonmolar tumors.Nonmolar tumors are grouped as gestational trophoblasticneoplasia or malignant gestational trophoblastic disease(ACOG, 2004). As an example, one of the nonmalignanttumors will be described. A hydatiform mole is a benign proliferating growth of the trophoblast in which the chorionic villi develop into edema-tous, cystic, vascular transparent vesicles that hang in grape-like clusters without a viable fetus (Fig. 7-13). Hydatiformmole develops in 1 to 2 of 1,000 pregnancies in the UnitedStates (Cunningham et al., 2010). This is a nonviable preg-nancy. In a normal pregnancy, the trophoblast cells develop into the placenta. The trophoblast cells have chorionic villithat form the endometrium. With a hydatiform mole pregnancy, there is a proliferation of the placenta and tro-phoblastic cells, which absorbs fluid from the maternal blood.Fluid accumulates into the chorionic villi and vesicles form3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page Period 164 out of the chorionic villi. The erythroblastic tissue of the complete hydatiform mole never develops into a fetus. The erythroblastic tissue of a partial hydatiform mole may includesome fetal tissue, but this is always abnormal and never matures. Risk Factors Maternal age younger than 15 or older than 45 years Previous molar pregnancy Risks for the Woman Increased risk of choriocarcinoma Assessment Findings Amenorrhea Nausea and vomiting Abnormal uterine bleeding ranges from spotting to pro-fuse hemorrhage Enlarged uterus Abdominal cramping and expulsion of vesicles Diagnosis of Medical Management Diagnosis of molar pregnancy is much earlier than beforebecause the routine use of ultrasound in early pregnancydetects the molar pregnancy earlier. hCG and transvaginal ultrasound Medical Management Immediate evacuation of mole with aspiration/suctionD&C Follow-up of hCG levels for at least 6 months to detecttrophoblastic neoplasia. After hCG levels fall to normalfor 6 months, pregnancy can be considered. Nursing Actions for Post Evacuation of Mole Monitor for signs and symptoms of hemorrhage such asabnormal VS, abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding. Assess uterus. Offer explanations and reassurance related to the planof care. Offer emotional support related to pregnancy loss. Assess response to diagnosis and treatment plan relatedto anxiety, fear, guilt.Provide support related to the pregnancy loss. Explain plan for follow-up care related to serial hCG. Give Rhogam if indicated. Assess significance of loss to woman and family(Gilbert, 2011).Acknowledge feeling of sadness, distress, or relief towardpregnancy loss. Give parents' choices and opportunities for decision making. Provide family with information on pregnancy loss andsupport groups. Provide psychological support appropriate to family'sresponse. Discharge teaching related to self-care and warning signsincluding:Teach patient to monitor for severe abdominal pain, exces-sive bleeding, and signs and symptoms of infection such asfever. Review plan for follow-up with care provider. Teach patient appropriate pain management. Emphasize importance of medical follow-up with regularHCG levels because of the risk of malignant trophoblas-tic disease and choriocarcinoma. Prophylactic chemotherapy is not routinely recommended(ACOG, 2004). INFECTIONS Infection is a common complication of pregnancy. The impactof infection on pregnancy is dependent on the infectious organ-ism involved. Some infectious agents, such as Trichomonas, areeasily treated and affect only the mother. Other infections, suchas rubella, can actively infect the fetus during pregnancy.Infections can be acquired by the fetus transplacentally, such asHIV; may ascend the birth canal; or can be acquired thoughcontact at the time of a vaginal birth, such as herpes. In the fol-lowing section, sexually transmitted diseases and TORCHinfections are reviewed, highlighting maternal and fetal effects,treatment, and nursing implications. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV/AIDS) The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) organism is a retrovirus of the lentivirus family that has an affinity for theT-lymphocytes, macrophages, and monocytes. HIV/AIDS isa virus passed from one person to another through blood andsexual contact. The cases of HIV/AIDS among female adultsand adolescents >13 years of age increased from 7% in 1985to 27% in 2007 (Gilbert, 2011). According to the Centers forDisease Control, among female adults and adolescents diag-nosed with HIV/AIDS in 2007, 83% of 10,977 HIV/AIDScases were attributed to high-risk heterosexual contact, 16%to injection drug use, and 1% to other risk factors. Transmission of HIV/AIDS is by exposure to blood or blood products or by-products. Transmission of HIV perina-tally happens through transplacental, intrapartal, and breastmilk exposure. Before the of antiviral therapy in pregnancy,Figure 7-13 Hydatidiform mole.3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 164CHAPTER 7 High-Risk Antepartum Nursing Care 165 the risk of infection for a neonate to an HIV seropositive mother was approximately 25%, ranging from 13%-39%.However, today most pregnant women are on regular anti-retroviral drug regimen, decreasing their HIV viral load toundetectable. As a result, the rate of maternal-child transmis-sion has decreased to less than 2% (ACOG, 2007). Factors Associated with Increased PerinatalTransmission Mother with AIDS Preterm delivery Decreased maternal CD4 count High maternal viral load Chorioamnionitis Blood exposure due to episiotomy, vaginal laceration, andforceps delivery Risks to Fetus and Newborn Risk of transmission is 20%-25% without the use of anti-retroviral drugs but can be as low as 2% with appropriateantepartal drug treatment. Preterm delivery Preterm PROM IUGR Assessment Findings Physical findings include fever, fatigue, vomiting, diar-rhea, weight loss, generalized lymphadenopathy, oral gin-givitis, vaginitis, and opportunistic infection. Medical Management Perform routine screening starting at first perinatal visit. Treatment of at least three antiretroviral drugs Nursing Actions in Antepartal Period Provide education and counseling on plan of care. Provide education and counseling on potential conse-quences of pregnancy on HIV disease progress, risk fortransmission, and consequences for neonate. Education to facilitate health promotionAdequate sleep Adequate diet as protein deficiency can depress immunity;adequate zinc and vitamin A for cell growth Avoidance of infection Provide emotional support. If the woman is diagnosed with HIV during pregnancy,she needs extensive and ongoing education and counsel-ing on plan of care and management. Nursing Actions in Intrapartal Period Avoid using instruments during birth. Leave fetal membranes intact. Avoid fetal scalp electrode. Avoid episiotomy and assisted vaginal delivery. Provide and reinforce education. Provide emotional support.Sexually Transmitted Infections Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), sometimes referred to as sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) remain a major public health challenge in the United States. The Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC, 2010) estimates that 19 millionnew infections occur every year, almost half of them amongyoung people age 15-24 years. STIs affect women of everysocioeconomic and educational level, age, race, and ethnicity. In addition to the physical and psychological consequences, the costs of treating STIs are estimated at more than $17 billionannually (CDC, 2010). Women who are pregnant can becomeinfected with the same STIs as women who are not pregnant.Pregnancy does not provide protection for the woman or thebaby, and consequences of an STI can be serious in pregnancy,even life-threatening for the woman and her baby. Intrauterineor perinatal transmitted STIs can have severely debilitatingeffects on women, their partners, and their fetuses. All womenshould be screened for STIs during their first prenatal visit.Table 7-5 shows the estimated number of women infected with specific STIs annually. Risks for the Woman STIs can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (Table 7-6). Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) can lead to infertility,chronic hepatitis, and cervical and other cancers. STIs during pregnancy can lead to PTL, PROM, anduterine infection.Table 7-7 summarizes information on maternal effects and management of STIs (CDC, 2010). Risks for the Fetus STIs can pass to the fetus by crossing the placenta; somecan be transmitted to the baby during delivery as the babypasses through the birth canal (see Table 7-7). Harmful effects to babies include preterm birth, low birthweight, neonatal sepsis, and neurological damage.

It is a common and serious complication of STIs.Pregnant women with PID are at high risk for maternal morbidity and preterm delivery and should be hospitalized and treated with IV antibiotics. An estimated more than 1 million women in the United States have an episode of acute PID. Can lead to infertility, ectopic pregnancy, abscess formation, and chronic pelvic pain.Scar tissue in fallopian tubes increases the occurrence of ectopic pregnancies. 10%-15% of women with PID become infertile. Signs and symptoms vary from none to severe including: Lower abdominal pain, fever, unusual vaginal discharge, painful urination, and irregular menstrual bleeding. Vague symptoms may go unrecognized. PID can be cured with antibiotics, but treatment does not reverse damage to reproductive organs.

TORCH Infections TORCH is an acronym that stands for Toxoplasmosis, Other (hepatitis B), R ubella, and C ytomegalovirus and Herpes simplex virus. TORCH infections are unique in theirpathogenesis and have potentially devastating effects on thedeveloping fetus (Table 7-8). Each disease is teratogenic tothe developing fetus. Risk Factors The risk status for these infections varies based on route oftransmission. Some are sexually transmitted diseases, such as3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 168CHAPTER 7 High-Risk Antepartum Nursing Care 169 TABLE 7-8 TORCH INFECTIONS MATERNAL PR EVENTION AND INFECTION EFFECTS FETAL EFFECTS MANAGEMENT NURSING ISSUES TOXOPLASMOSIS BDirect contact with blood or body from infected MEASLES)Nasopharyngeal HERPES SIMPLEXVIRUS (HSV)Chronic lifelong viral infection Contact at ascending infection Source: Queenan, Hobbins, adults mayhave mononucleo-sis-like syndrome.

Two catastrophic events canoccur during pregnancy after blunt trauma to the abdomen:Placental abruption Uterine ruptureExtensive discussion of management and care during trau- ma in pregnancy is beyond the scope of this chapter, but keyelements of stabilization of the woman and the fetus andassessments are briefly reviewed. Treatment priorities forinjured pregnant women typically are directed as they wouldbe for non-pregnant women. Some important considerationsrelated to pregnancy are presented in the following section. Assessment Findings Assessment findings are based on injury. Initial maternalevaluation is the systematic evaluation performed accordingto the standard Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) pro-tocols. Initial maternal evaluation and resuscitation takesprecedence over fetal evaluation. Early recognition of mater-nal compromise and rapid resuscitation reduces maternalmortality, which in turn reduces fetal mortality.Physiological changes in pregnancy might delay the usualvital sign changes of hypovolemia; blood loss of up to1,500 mL can occur without a change in maternal vitalsign changes. Uterine contractions more frequently than every 10 min-utes may be an indication of placental abruption(Cunningham et al., 2010). Fetal well-being reflects maternal and fetal status, andconversely fetal heart rate changes may indicate maternaldeterioration such as hypoxia. Medical Management Treatment priorities and medical management for the preg-nant trauma patient are the same as for the non-pregnantwoman in the initial evaluation. Admission and continuousfetal monitoring for 24 to 48 hours after stabilization, in par-ticular for abdominal injuries because of the increased inci-dence of placental abruption, is recommended. Nursing Actions Treatment priorities for injured pregnant women typical-ly are directed as they would be for non-pregnantwomen. Initial actions in trauma care are focused on maternal sta-bilization. PREGESTATIONAL COMPLICATIONS Women who enter pregnancy with a preexisting disease orchronic medical condition are at increased risk for complicationand are considered high-risk. These high-risk pregnanciesherpes; others have various routes of transmission to woman(CDC, 2010). Risk for the Woman Depends on the infectious agent (CDC, 2010; seeTable 7-8) Risks for the Fetus The usual route of transmission to the fetus is transpla-centally (see Table 7-8). Infections acquired in utero can result in intrauterinegrowth restriction, prematurity, chronic postnatal infec-tion, and even death. Assessment Findings Maternal assessment findings vary with the organism (seeTable 7-8). Medical Management Medical management varies based on the organism,trimester of exposure, and clinical evidence of neonatalsequelae (see Table 7-8). Nursing Actions Nursing considerations vary with the organism (seeTable 7-8). Provide emotional support. Instruct woman on treatment plan. TRAUMA DURING PREGNANCY Trauma is the leading cause of maternal death during pregnancyand is more likely to cause maternal death than any other com-plication of pregnancy. The most common cause of maternaldeath by trauma is abdominal injury (resulting in hemorrhagicshock) and head injury. Injury to the pregnant woman can resultfrom blunt or penetrating trauma. The most common cause ofblunt injury is motor vehicle accidents. The most common causeof penetrating trauma is from gunshot wounds. The mecha-nisms of maternal and fetal injury, gestational age of the fetus,and secondary complications determine the maternal-fetalresponse to trauma. Maternal outcome in trauma corresponds tothe severity of the injury. Fetal outcome depends on injury andmaternal physiological response (Van Otterloo, 2011). It isessential to keep in mind that at term, 15% of maternal cardiacoutput, that is, 750 mL to 1000 mL/min, flow through the placental bed; unresolved bleeding can lead to maternal exsan-guination in 8 to 10 minutes (Burke-Sosa, 2014). Pregnancy causes both anatomic and physiological changes that impact the woman's response to traumatic injury. Forexample, increased plasma volume by 50% and increased redblood cell volume of 30% can mask hemorrhage. Any conditionthat results in maternal hypotension, such as hemorrhage orhypovolemia, results in vasoconstriction of the uterine arteriesand shunting of blood to vital organs. The shunting of bloodfrom the uteroplacental unit maintains maternal blood pressureat the expense of perfusion to the fetus. The pregnant woman3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 170CHAPTER 7 High-Risk Antepartum Nursing Care 171 require extensive surveillance and collaboration of multiple disciplines to achieve an optimal pregnancy outcome. Womenoften experience fear and anxiety for their health and that of the fetus regarding the impact of the chronic disease on thepregnancy outcome. Any preexisting medical disease can com-plicate the pregnancy or be exacerbated during pregnancy.Increasing numbers of women with chronic diseases are achiev-ing pregnancy. Nursing care is focused on decreasing compli-cations and providing support and education to patients andfamilies to facilitate their participation in their health care during pregnancy. Women and their families should participate in decision- making and the plan of care to optimize outcomes for both thewoman and the fetus. Maternal safety is the prime considerationin all pregnancies. The major preexisting medical complicationsthat impact pregnancy are discussed in this chapter, although allof the possible preexisting medical conditions impacting preg-nancy are beyond the scope of this chapter. When caring forwomen who have preexisting diseases, textbooks on high-riskpregnancy management and perinatal journals are the bestsources of information. (See Quality and Safety Education forNurses (QSEN) Patient Centered Care.)and ischemic heart disease is on the rise as a result of obesity,hypertension, diabetes, and delayed childbearing (Arafeh,2014). Some of the normal cardiac changes during pregnancycan exacerbate cardiac disease during pregnancy, including:Increase in total blood volume 30%-50% Increase in cardiac output that peaks at 28 to 32 weeks ofgestation Plasma volume expansion by 45% Increase in RBC by 20% Increased cardiac output by 40% Increased heart rate by 15% Heart slightly enlarges and displaces upward and to theleft anatomically. The weight of the gravid uterus can lie on the inferiorvena cava, causing compression and hypotension anddecreasing cardiac output. Increased estrogen leads to vasodilatation, which lowersperipheral resistance and increases cardiac output. Autonomic nervous system influences are more promi-nent on blood pressure.Marked hemodynamic changes in pregnancy can have a profound effect on the pregnant woman with cardiac diseaseand may result in exceeding the functional capacity of the dis-eased heart (Cunningham et al., 2010; Arafeh, 2014; Mattson& Smith, 2004), resulting in:Pulmonary hypertension Pulmonary edema Congestive heart failure Maternal or fetal deathExtensive discussion of specific cardiac disorders and their management is beyond the scope of this text. Reference totexts that deal with management of high-risk pregnancy par-ticularly during labor and delivery is indicated when caring forwomen with underlying heart disease, but general principlesare presented. The management of cardiac disease is relatedto the cardiac disorder that is present and the impact it has oncardiac function responsible for specific symptoms. Risks for the Woman Maternal mortality with cardiac disorders ranges from1%-50% based on cardiac disorder. Maternal effects include severe pulmonary edema, sys-temic emboli, and congestive heart failure. Risks for the Fetus and Newborn Fetal effects are a result of decreased systemic circulationand/or decreased oxygenation. If maternal circulation is compromised because of decreasedcardiac function, uterine blood flow is reduced, which canresult in intrauterine growth restriction. Fetal oxygenationis impaired when maternal oxygenation is impaired. Fetal hypoxia can result in permanent CNS damagedepending on length and severity of decreased oxygenation. Neonatal death secondary to maternal cardiac diseaseranges from 3%-50%.Quality and Safety Education for Nurses(QSEN) Patient-Centered Care Recognize the patient or designee as the source of controland full partner in providing compassionate and coordinatedcare based on respect for the patient's preferences, values,and needs. Women experiencing pregnancy complications are vul- nerable in very special ways physiologically, psychologically,emotionally, and spiritually. Nurses are in a unique positionto explore a woman's needs and advocate for the woman'sparticipation in management of pregnancy complications.Some suggestions to foster respect for a woman's prefer-ences, values, and needs include: Elicit patient values, preferences, and expressed needs as part of clinical interview, implementation of care plan,and evaluation of care. Communicate patient values, preferences, and expressed needs to other members of the health care team. Value the patient's expertise with her own health and symptoms. Respect patient and family preferences for degree of active engagement in care process.QSEN Cardiovascular Disorders Pregnancy complicated by cardiovascular disease is potentiallydangerous to maternal and fetal well-being. The incidence ofcardiac disease among pregnant women ranges from 0.5%-4% and varies in form and severity (Gilbert, 2011; Gaddipati& Troiano, 2013). Cardiac disease during pregnancy may be categorized as congenital, acquired, or ischemic. The spec-trum and severity of heart disease observed in reproductive-age women is changing. Today, congenital heart diseaseaccounts for more than half of cardiac disease in pregnancy,3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 171UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 172 Assessment Findings Diagnosis of cardiac disease is based on symptoms anddiagnostic tests, which may include ECG, echocardio-gram, and lab tests. The usual signs of deteriorating cardiac function include:Dyspnea, severe enough to limit usual activity Progressive orthopnea Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea Syncope during or after exertion Palpitations Chest pain with or without activity Fatigue Cyanosis Thromboembolitic changes Fluid retention Medical Management Medical management varies based on cardiac disease andshould include collaboration between obstetricians,maternal fetal medicine specialists, cardiologists, anesthe-siologists, and other specialists as needed. Discuss with the woman estimations of maternal and fetal mortality, potential chronic morbidity, and interventions to minimize risk during pregnancy and delivery. Obtain laboratory test to evaluate renal function andprofusion (electrolytes, serum creatinine, proteins, anduric acid). Invasive pulmonaryartery catheters, peripheral arterial catheters, or centralvenous pressure monitors may be necessary. Drug therapy is dependent on cardiac lesion. Vaginal delivery is recommended for most patients withcardiac disease. Preterm delivery may be indicated for deterioratingmaternal or fetal status. Nursing Actions Nursing measures are directed toward prevention of com-plications (Gilbert, 2011). Review the woman's history related to cardiovascular disorder, including previous therapies or surgery, currentmedications, and current functional classification of cardiac disease. Conduct a cardiovascular assessment (Gaddipati &Troiano, 2013) that includes:Auscultation of heart, lungs, and breath sounds LOC, BP, HR, capillary refill check Evaluation of respiratory rate and rhythm Evaluation of cardiac rate and rhythm Body weight and weight gain Assessment of skin color, temperature, and turgor Identification of pathological edema Additional noninvasive assessment assessment with 12-lead EKG ElectrocardiogramUrinary output Electronic fetal monitoring Review laboratory results related to renal function andperfusion.Electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine,proteins, uric acid Determine the patient's and family's understanding of theeffect of her cardiac disease on her pregnancy. Provide information to the woman and her familyregarding status of woman and fetus and plan of care.Antepartal testing including NSTs, BPPs, and ultrasounds New medications may include anticoagulation therapy;therefore, women need to learn to give self-injections. Provide emotional support to the woman and her family. Refer patient to high-risk pregnancy support groups. Facilitate home health and other referrals PRN. Hematological Disorders Pregnancy results in intravascular volume expansion, withthe increase in plasma volume larger than the rise in erythro-cyte volume, resulting in hemodilution of pregnancy thatresults in a drop in the hemoglobin and hematocrit. Duringpregnancy there is an increased potential for thrombosisresulting from increased levels of coagulation factors anddecreased fibrinolysis, venous dilation, and by the gravid uterus. Thromboembolyic dis-eases occurring most frequently in pregnancy include deepvein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism; both areaddressed in Chapter 7. Iron-Deficiency Anemia Anemia complicates 15%-60% of all pregnancies (Yancy, 2011),and 75% of those anemias are a result of iron deficiency relatedto a diet low in iron content and insufficient iron stores.Pregnancy results in an intravascular volume expansion with theincrease in plasma volume larger than the rise in RBCs, resultingin the hemodilution of pregnancy; the net result is a physiologicaldrop in hemoglobin and hematocrit values. Iron deficiency ane-mia during pregnancy is the consequence primarily of expansionof plasma volume without normal expansion of maternal hemo-globin mass (Cunningham et al., 2010). Anemia is present if the hemoglobin drops below 11 g/dL in the first and third trimestersand below 10 g/dL in the second trimester (Yancy, 2011).Discussion of acquired and inherited anemias and hemoglo-binopathies are beyond the scope of this chapter. Risk Factors History of poor nutritional status or eating disorder Close spacing of pregnancies Multiple gestation Excessive bleeding Adolescence Risks for the Woman Fatigue Reduced tolerance to activity3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 172CHAPTER 7 High-Risk Antepartum Nursing Care 173 Risks for the Newborn Preterm birth Intrauterine growth restriction Assessment Findings Pallor Fatigue, weakness, and malaise Reduced exercise tolerance and dyspnea Anorexia and/or pica Edema Hemoglobin below 10-11 g/dL Hematocrit below 30% Medical Management Iron supplementationSupplement with 325 mg tid ferrous sulfate. Nursing Actions Refer the woman to a dietitian for nutritional counselingand reinforce dietary interventions. Advise that taking iron supplementation at bedtime andon an empty stomach may increase absorption anddecrease gastrointestinal upset. Discuss strategies to deal with constipation PRN. Assess fatigue and develop interventions and a plan ofcare to deal with fatigue. Pulmonary Disorders Normal physiological changes of pregnancy can cause awoman with a history of compromised respiratory functionto decompensate. Pulmonary disease has become moreprevalent in women of childbearing age. Pulmonary dis-eases, such as pneumonia or tocolytic induced pulmonaryedema, can develop during pregnancy whereas other condi-tions such as asthma preexist. It is important to rememberthat some of the normal respiratory changes during preg-nancy can exacerbate respiratory disease during pregnancy.Alteration in the immune system and mechanical andanatomical changes have a cumulative effect to decrease tolerance to hypoxia and acute changes in pulmonary func-tion (McMurtry-Baird & Kennedy, 2014; Gilbert, 2011).These include:Increased progesterone during pregnancy results inmaternal hyperventilation and increased tidal volume. Changes in configuration of the thorax with advancingpregnancy decrease residual capacity and volume whileoxygen consumption increases. Increased estrogen levels result in mucosal edema, hyper-secretion, and capillary congestion. Respiratory physiology in normal pregnancy tends towardrespiratory alkalosis.Respiratory emergencies, such as pulmonary embolism and amniotic fluid embolism (anaphylactoid syndrome), are dis-cussed in other sections of the chapter. Asthma is presentedas an exemplar of the impact of pregnancy on a preexistingpulmonary disorder.Asthma Asthma is the most common form of lung disease that canimpact pregnancy and complicates about 8% of pregnancies.Asthma is an irrevocable syndrome characterized by varying levels of airway obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness,and bronchial edema. Diagnosis and management goals of asthma during preg- nancy are the same as for nonpregnant women. People withasthma have airways that are hyperresponsive to allergens,viruses, air pollutants, exercise, and cold air. This hyperre-sponsiveness is manifested by bronchospasm, mucosal edema,and mucus plugging the airways. Goals of therapy include:Protection of the pulmonary system from irritants Prevention of pulmonary and inflammatory response toallergen exposure Relief of bronchospasm Resolution of airway inflammation to reduce airwayhyper-responsiveness Improve pulmonary function Risks for the Woman Pregnancy has varying effects on asthma, with about one-third of pregnant women becoming worse, one-third improving, and one-third remaining the same(Gilbert, 2011). If symptoms worsen, they tend to do so between 17-24 weeks' gestation (Gilbert, 2011). With aggressive management of asthma, pregnancy out-comes can be the same as for nonasthmatic pregnantwomen. Uncontrolled asthma increases the risk of preeclampsia,hypertension, and hyperemesis gravidarum. Risks for the Fetus and Newborn Hypoxia to the fetus is a major complication. Preterm birth Low birth weight Assessment Findings Signs and symptoms of asthma:Cough (productive or nonproductive) Wheezing Tightness in chest Shortness of breath Increased respiratory rate (> 20 breaths/min) Signs and symptoms of hypoxia:Cyanosis Lethargy Agitation or confusion Intercostal retractions Respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min Medical Management Asthma should be aggressively treated during pregnancy, as thebenefits of asthma control far outweigh the risks of medicationuse. During pregnancy, monthly evaluation of pulmonary 3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 173UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 174 function and asthma history are conducted. Serial ultrasoundfor fetal growth and antepartal fetal testing is done for moder-ately or severely asthmatic women.Medications commonly used for asthma management areconsidered safe during pregnancy and include bronchodila-tors, anti-inflammatory agents such as inhaled steroids,oral corticosteroids, allergy injections, and antihistamines. Nursing Actions Take a detailed history and assessment of respiratory status, including pulmonary function and blood gases. Assess for signs and symptoms including cough, wheez-ing, chest tightness, and sputum production. Care for women with acute asthma exacerbations includes:Oxygen administration to maintain Pa O2greater than 95% Ongoing maternal pulse oximeter Baseline arterial blood gases as per orders Baseline pulmonary function tests performed to gatherbaseline data as per orders Beta-agonist inhalation therapy as ordered Monitor maternal oxygen saturation (should be at 95% tooxygenate the fetus). Assess fetal well-being and for signs of fetal hypoxia. Evaluate pulmonary function test results and laboratorytests (i.e., arterial blood gases). Explain the plan of care and goals. Teach the woman to avoid allergens and triggers. Teach the woman to monitor pulmonary function dailyand her normal parameters. Teach the woman the role of medications, correct use ofmedications, and adverse effects of medications. Teach the woman to recognize signs and symptoms ofworsening asthma and provide a treatment plan to man-age exacerbations appropriately. Discuss warning signs and symptoms to report to theprovider, such as dyspnea, shortness of breath, chesttightness, or exacerbations of signs and symptoms beyondthe woman's baseline asthma status. Gastrointestinal Disorders Cholelithiasis, presence of gallstones in the gallbladder, occurs in approximately 8% of pregnancies (Gilbert, 2011).Decreased muscle tone allows gallbladder distension andthickening of the bile and prolongs emptying time duringpregnancy, increasing the risk of cholelithiasis. Assessment Findings Colicky abdominal pain presents in the right upper quadrant;anorexia, nausea, and vomiting; the woman may have a fever.Gallstones are present on an ultrasound scan. Medical Management Cholelithiasis is typically treated with conservative managementsuch as IV fluids, bowel rest, nasogastric suctioning, diet, andantibiotics. Increasingly, it is managed by surgical interventionwith laparoscopic cholecystectomies (Cunningham et al., 2010).If gallbladder disease is nonacute, surgical intervention may bedelayed until the postpartum period. Nursing Actions Manage pain, administering pain medication as needed. Manage nausea and vomiting, minimizing environmentalfactors that cause nausea and vomiting such as odors. Administer antiemetics as needed. Provide comfort measures based on symptoms. Explain procedures and plan of care including dietaryrestrictions. Venous Thromboembolic Venous stasis in the blood volume, and compression of theinferior vena cava and pelvic veins with advancing gestationall combine to increase risk five times over non-pregnantwomen (Krivak & Zorn, 2007). About half of the cases ofvenous thromboembolism during pregnancy are associatedwith a common risk factor for thrombophilia. Acquiredand/or inherited thrombophilia are associated with severepreeclampsia, restriction(IUGR), intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD), preterm birth,and recurrent miscarriage Creehan, 2008).Thrombophilia can be an inheritable hypercoagulable condi-tion caused by mutations in clotting mechanisms. The mostcommon acquired thrombophilia during pregnancy isantiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLA). These anti-bodies are a result of antigenic changes in which during pregnancy include:Bed rest Obesity Severe varicose vein Dehydration Trauma History of thrombosis Medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, renaldisease or serious infections Assessment Findings Classic signs of DVT are dependant edema, unilateral legpain, erythema, low-grade fever, and positive Homan'ssign (i.e., pain with dorsiflexion of foot). A PE may present with shortness of breath, tachypnea,tachycardia, dyspnea, pleural chest pain, fever, and anxiety. Medical Management Objective tests for DVT include Doppler ultrasound, magneticresonance venography, and pulsed Doppler study. X-ray, CT, and electrocardiography are used to diagnose PE.Treatment goals include prevention of further clot propagation,3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 174CHAPTER 7 High-Risk Antepartum Nursing Care 175 prevention of PE, and prevention of further venous throm-boembolism (Krivak & Zorn, 2007).Anticoagulation therapy is required for women experi-encing a DVT during pregnancy with heparin. Treatment of PE is to stabilize a woman with a life-threatening PE and transfer to ICU. Thromboembolitictherapy and catheter or surgical embolectomy may be done. Nursing Actions Manage pain, administering pain medication as needed. Teach woman how to administer heparin SQ to herabdomen. Instruct woman to report side effects such as bleedinggums, nosebleeds, easy bruising, or excessive trauma atinjection sites. Maternal Obesity Maternal obesity has long been recognized as a risk factor inpregnancy. There is a well-established risk factor for thedevelopment of diabetes,and thrombosis (ACOG, McLean, 2008). Many of the systemic physiological alter-ations that occur during pregnancy may be altered when thepregnant woman is obese (Ramachenderan, Bradford, &McLean, 2008). For example:The typical increase in cardiac output associated withpregnancy is compounded when a woman is obese and isinfluenced by the degree and duration of obesity. Cardiacoutput increases by 30-50 mL/min for every 100 g of fatdeposited. Blood volume is increased as well. A degree ofcardiac hypertrophy is normal during pregnancy, but obe-sity exaggerates the hypertrophy and contributes tomyocardial dilation. Although obese women can experience more frequentepisodes of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) than womenwith normal BMI, pregnancy may exert a protectiveeffect on OSA occurrence. Pregnant women are more prone to gastric reflux, givenassociated hormonal and anatomic changes. The inci-dence of hiatus hernia is greater in obese patients, andabdominal pressure and intragastric volume are increasedin the obese patient. Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state, and obesity furtherincreases the risk of thrombosis by promoting venous sta-sis, increasing blood viscosity, and promoting activationof the coagulation cascade. A large panniculus, that is, a thick layer of adipose tissuein the abdominal area, sometimes called a fatty apron,may contribute to uterine compression and exaggerate the vena cava syndrome to which pregnant women aresusceptible. Assessment Findings BMI of 30Medical Management Provide specific information on maternal risks of obesityin pregnancy. Provide specific information on the increased risk for aninfant with a neural tube defect and for a stillborn infant. These risks require heightened and ongoing evaluation ofthe pregnant woman and fetus. Nursing Actions Reinforce information on maternal and fetal risks associ-ated with obesity. Provide teaching on signs and symptoms of preeclampsia,diabetes, sleep apnea, and vena cava syndrome. Ensure woman understands plan of care for increased andongoing evaluation of pregnancy. Because pregnancy presents an ideal time during whichto initiate simple healthy behaviors, such as walking andproper diet that can be maintained after birth, offer sug-gestions and encouragement for lifestyle changes. Provide referrals to dietitian for nutritional counselingand reinforce guidelines for diet and weight gain. Use caution when shifting the panniculus to assess forfetal heart sounds or when providing personal hygiene, asthe redistributed weight may alter maternal hemodynam-ics and increase the risk of vena cava compression. Encouraging the woman to sleep in a sitting positionmay help, as effects of obesity on the respiratory systemare decreased in this position. Making appropriate environmental changes to accommodatethe larger patient, such as assuring that patient beds, examin-ing tables, and chairs can support at least 400 pounds. SUBSTANCE ABUSE Alcohol, cigarette, and illicit drug use during pregnancy cancause poor pregnancy outcomes and early childhood behavioraland development problems. Recent reports show that alcoholuse among pregnant women in the first trimester was 19.0%,for those in the second trimester 7.8%, and for the thirdtrimester 6.2%. There were similar patterns for past-monthbinge alcohol use, cigarette use, and marijuana use (SubstanceAbuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Office ofApplied Studies, 2009). The findings in this report suggest that many U.S. women, particularly those in the thirdtrimester, are getting the message and abstaining from sub-stance use. Still, a sizeable proportion of women in the firsttrimester of pregnancy were past-month users of alcohol, ciga-rettes, or marijuana, and one in seven women used cigarettes inthe second or third trimester. In addition, many women areresuming use of these substances after childbirth, and thatresumption appears to be rapid given the higher rates for mothers of infants under 3 months old compared with pregnantwomen in the second or third trimesters. Effective interventionsfor women to further reduce substance use during pregnancyand to prevent postpartum resumption of use could improve theoverall health and well-being of mothers and infants.3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 175UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 176 Many pregnant women who use illicit drugs also use alco- hol and tobacco, and it may be difficult to determine whichcomplications are associated with which substance. Risks ofspecific complications vary based on substance used; however,general risks resulting from substance abuse for both thewoman and fetus/newborn are presented. Pregnant womenusing illicit substances often fear legal consequences and mayavoid seeking prenatal care. A nonjudgmental and factualapproach with attention toward reducing risks offers the bestapproach for these complex pregnancies. Chemically depen - dent pregnant women may engage in other risky behaviors. Aholistic, comprehensive approach to care that deals not onlywith the prenatal aspects of care, but also with the complexsocial and psychological contributing factors, is needed. Smoking/Tobacco Use Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of prematuredelivery, low-birth-weight infants, and stillbirth. Pregnantwomen were more likely to have smoked cigarettes duringtheir first trimester (22.9%) than during their second (14.3 %) or third (15.3 %) trimesters (Substance Abuse andMental Health Services Administration, 2007). The samereport cites studies suggesting that women who stop smok-ing by the first trimester give birth to infants with weightand body measurements comparable with those of infants ofnonsmokers (US DHHS, 2008). The physiological effectsof smoking are a result of transient intrauterine hypoxemia.The more the woman smokes, the greater the risk (March ofDimes, 2008a). Cigarette smoke contains many chemicals,in particular nicotine and carbon monoxide, that causeadverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly low birth weightand prematurity.Nicotine reduces uterine blood flow. Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin, reducing theoxygen-carrying capacity of the blood (Creasy, Resnik, &Iams, 2004). Alcohol Alcohol use during pregnancy can cause physical and mentalbirth defects, preterm births, and miscarriages. Because a safelevel of alcohol intake during pregnancy cannot be deter-mined, both the U.S. Surgeon General and the March ofDimes Foundation recommend that pregnant women notconsume any alcohol. White women were more likely thanHispanic women to have drunk alcohol in the past monthregardless of their pregnancy status. Generally, higher educa-tion status and higher family income were associated withhigher rates of alcohol use among all women of childbearingage regardless of their pregnancy status. Among women aged18-44, those with a college education were nearly twice aslikely as their counterparts with less than a high school edu-cation to have used alcohol in the past month in each preg-nancy status category. Similarly, women age 15-44 withannual family incomes of $75,000 or higher had the highestrates of alcohol use in the prior month compared with thosewith lower family incomes in all three pregnancy status categories (Substance Abuse and Mental Health ServicesAdministration, 2008). Other data from the CDC reports12.2% of pregnant women (about 1 in 8) drink during preg-nancy, and 1.9% of pregnant women (about 1 in 50) reportedbinge drinking in the past 30 days. Pregnant women age 15-17 years may be in particular need of alcohol prevention services tailored for their agegroup because nearly 16% of them used alcohol in the pastmonth. Pregnant women in this age group consumed an aver-age of 24 drinks in the past month (i.e., they drank on anaverage of six days during the past month and an average ofabout four drinks on the days that they drank). Alcohol is the most common teratogen (Gilbert, 2007). When a pregnant woman drinks, alcohol passes swiftly to thefetus through the placenta. Because alcohol is processed moreslowly in the fetus's liver, the alcohol level can be even higherand can remain elevated longer. Drinking alcohol duringpregnancy can result in a wide range of physical and mentalbirth defects. The term \"fetal alcohol spectrum disorder\"(FASD) is used to describe the many problems associatedwith alcohol exposure prior to birth. Alcohol consumed during pregnancy increases the risk of alcohol-related birth defects, including growth deficiencies,facial abnormalities, central nervous system impairment,behavioral disorders, and impaired intellectual development(Bertrand, Floyd, Weber, O'Connor, Riley, Johnson, &Cohen, 2004). Each year in the United States up to 40,000infants are born with FASDs (March of Dimes, 2008b).Chapter 17 provides additional information on FASDs. Theconsensus is that no level of drinking alcohol is consideredsafe in pregnancy. Illicit Drugs An average of 5.2% of pregnant women use illicit drugs suchas marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, heroin, and Ecstasy (US DHHS, 2008). The effect of the drug on placental function and fetal development depends on its nature. Forexample, cocaine causes vasoconstriction that can impact theplacenta and uterus, resulting in abruption of the placenta orpreterm birth (Foley, 2002; March of Dimes, 2006c). Womenwho use illicit drugs are counseled to stop, except for heroinusers, for whom methadone treatment is recommended toprevent stillbirth. Cocaine Cocaine abuse and addiction is a complex problem whichinvolves physiological changes in the brain as well aschanges in psychosocial and environmental factors.Biologically, cocaine blocks the reuptake of catecholaminesat the nerve terminal, which results in an increase in circu-lating catecholamines in the blood and leads to vasocon-striction. Cardiovascular and neurological complicationssuch as hypertension, tachycardia, uterine contractions,myocardial dysrhythmias, subarachnoid hemor-rhage, thrombocytopenia, seizures and even sudden deathhave been described among patients who abuse cocaine.Acute use of cocaine during the third trimester can result in3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 176CHAPTER 7 High-Risk Antepartum Nursing Care 177 preterm labor, a greater incidence of PROM, abruptio placentae, precipitous delivery, increased risk for meconiumstaining, and premature and low-birth-weight infants(Moran, 2011). Heroin Heroin abuse during pregnancy is linked to adverse conse-quences to both mother and fetus. It is believed that the hazards of heroin to the fetus are directly related to the physiological dependence effect on the fetus and the maternal lifestyle associated with heroin use. The primaryeffects of heroin include analgesia, sedation, feeling of well-being, and euphoria. Women who use heroin duringpregnancy typically do not seek early prenatal care for fear ofdetection of heroin use and are at an increased risk to expo-sure to serious infections such as STDs, hepatitis, and HIV.The neonatal effects of prenatal heroin exposure includewithdrawal symptoms, increased incidence of meconiumaspiration at birth, increased incidence of sepsis, IUGR, andneurodevelopmental behavioral problems (Moran, 2011). Marijuana Marijuana use causes tachycardia and low blood pressure,which can result in orthostatic hypotension. Research hasshown the neonates born to mothers who used marijuanaduring pregnancy can have an altered response to visual stim-uli, increased tremilousness, and even a high-pitched crywhich may indicate a problem with neurological development(Moran, 2011). Risks for the Woman Using Substances duringPregnancy Preterm labor PPROM Poor weight gain and nutritional status Placental abnormalities (placenta previa, abruptio placentae) Risks for the Fetus and Newborn Effects of maternal substance use on the neonate aredetailed in Chapter 17. Stillbirth Low birth weight Preterm birth Intrauterine growth restriction Neonatal withdrawal syndrome (symptoms are dependenton drug used during pregnancy) (See Chapter 17) Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) Assessment Findings in Women Using Substancesduring Pregnancy A variety of screening tools have been proposed, and screeningfor smoking, alcohol use, and illicit drugs is recommended tostart at the first prenatal visit. Universal screening of all pregnantwomen is recommended in a supportive and nonjudgmentalmanner (Gilbert, 2007). One simple screening tool includesasking the following four questions for a yes or no response,described as Ewing's 4 P's (Taylor, Zaichkin, & Bailey, 2002).Have you ever used alcohol or drugs during this pregnancy? Have you had a problem with drugs or alcohol in the past? Does your partner have a problem with drugs or alcohol? Do you consider one of your parents to have a problem with drugs or alcohol?A yes answer to any of these questions should trigger further evaluation of habits. Medical Management (Creasy, Resnik, & Iams, 2004) Screen for substance use in pregnancy with all pregnantwomen (American College of Obstetricians andGynecologists, 2008). Refer to multispecialty clinics. Refer to drug treatment programs. Screen for domestic violence. Conduct frequent urine toxicology tests. Use targeted ultrasound to rule out congenital anomalies. Provide patient education. Conduct antepartal testing. Nursing Actions for the Woman Using Substancesduring Pregnancy Women are more receptive to treatment and lifestylechanges during pregnancy; therefore, pregnancy may be awindow of opportunity for chemically dependent womento enter treatment. To facilitate this, nurses must be armedwith knowledge and information necessary to screen andidentify women who abuse substances during pregnancy. Provide health education about the risks to the fetus ofsubstance use during pregnancy and facilitate early diag-nosis and appropriate intervention and referral. Laws governing drug screening during pregnancy varyfrom state to state. Nurses need to be aware of laws andlocal guidelines for toxicology screening of pregnantwomen and treatment options and availability of pro-grams, as many treatment programs will not accept preg-nant women. Counsel women who test positive for drug or alcohol useand those who smoke during pregnancy to stop and sup-ply referrals to assist with cessation and refer to localtreatment centers for pregnant women (Box 7-5). Maintain a nonjudgmental and nonpunitive attitude (Selleck& Redding, 1998); remember addiction is a disease. It has been proposed that government policies can beviewed as either \"facilitative\" or \"adversarial\" (Bornstein,2003). Facilitative policies improve women's access toprenatal care, food, shelter, and treatment. Adversarial policies propose that women who fail to seektreatment are liable to criminal prosecution and maydiminish utilization of prenatal care. Because of the substantial costs and repercussions of druguse during pregnancy for newborns, women, and society,it is essential to devise methods of intervention thatdecrease this risky behavior. Pregnant women aged 15-17 may be in particular needof alcohol prevention services tailored for their age groupbecause of the high rates of alcohol use in pregnancy.3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 177UNIT 2 Antepartal Period 178 Many women who need substance abuse treatment may not receive it due to lack of money or child care, fear of losingcustody of their children, or other barriers. For successfulrecovery, women often need a continuum of care for anextended period of time, including:Comprehensive inpatient or outpatient treatment foralcohol and other drugs Case managementCounseling and other mental health treatment Medical and prenatal care Child care Transportation Follow-up pediatric and early intervention services forchildren Services that respond to women's needs regardingreproductive health, sexuality, relationships, and victimization Other support services, such as housing, education andjob training, financial support services, parenting educa-tion, legal services, and aftercare.A study of women who continued to use alcohol or drugs after learning they were pregnant found that they were morefrequent users than spontaneous quitters, more likely tosmoke cigarettes, and had more psychosocial stressors(Harrison & Sidebottom, 2009). Achieving higher rates ofcessation may require approaches that simultaneously addresssubstance use and impediments to quitting. Research showsthat residential substance abuse treatment designed specifical-ly for pregnant women and women with children can havesubstantial benefits in terms of recovery, pregnancy outcomes,parenting skills, and women's ability to maintain or regaincustody of their children.BOX 7-5 REFERRALS FOR INFORMATION AND SUPPORT ON QUITTING SUBSTANCEUSE DURING PREGNANCY Alcoholics Anonymous www.aa.org Narcotics Anonymous www.na.org Smoking Cessation www.ahrg.gov/consumer/tobacco/quits.htmwww.helppregnantsmokersquit.comwww.cancer.orgwww.smokefreefamilies.orgwww.marchofdimes.org3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 178CHAPTER 7 High-Risk Antepartum Nursing Care 179 Problem No. 1: Central Nervous System Irritability Goal: Prevent seizures and cerebral edema Outcome: Patient will remain seizure free and not develop neurological sequelae.

As the nurse, you evaluate Mallory Polk in triage in the laborand delivery unit. She presented in the triage unit at 8 P.M. at 32 weeks' gestation with complaints of a persistent low, dull backache; increased vaginal discharge; and pelvic pressurein her vagina for two days with some vaginal spotting this evening when she went to the bathroom. She attributedthe discomforts of backache and pulling to working long hours for the past week in arbitration on a \"big case,\" as she is a partner in a large law firm. Mallory is a 42-year-old single African American woman. She is accompanied by hersister Alison, who is visiting for the week from out of state.When placed on the monitor, Mallory is contracting every 5-7 minutes that she reports as \"menstrual cramping.\" The FHR is in the 150s baseline with accelerations to 170s with moderate variability. A review of her prenatal recordreveals she is a G2 P0 and the pregnancy is a result of in vitrofertilization. She has received regular prenatal visits. She doesnot smoke or drink alcohol. Her prenatal laboratory results areas follows: /H17039Blood negative Summary Mallory began prenatal care at 10 weeks' gestation and receives regular prenatal care. She conceives after three attemptsat in vitro fertilization. She has no prior medical complicationsand has experienced a normal pregnancy. Her first pregnancywas terminated at 6 weeks of gestation. She is allergic to shellfishand is allergic to sulfa drugs. An ultrasound at 12 weeks confirmsa gestational age of 32 weeks.Detail the aspects of your initial assessment and what you would report to her physician. Within 40 minutes of arrival, you phone her physician, who is completing a delivery, and report your assessment findings. Thephysician comes to the unit in 10 minutes to evaluate Mallory.Based on her assessment, she orders an IV lactated Ringer's 300-mL bolus, a CBC, and urinalysis clean catch; does a fetalfibronectin; and does a sterile vaginal exam that reveals her cervixis 2 cm dilated/75% effaced/0 station. Her physician orders a 4-g magnesium sulfate bolus over 30 minutes, then 2 g per hour.Betamethasone is to be given 12 mg now and to be repeated in24 hours. An ultrasound is ordered for fetal size and position.TYING IT ALL TOGETHER3704_Ch07_131-184 20/09/13 10:45 AM Page 180CHAPTER 7 High-Risk Antepartum Nursing Care 181 Ampicillin 1 g is ordered IV every 6 hours. Her physician discuss-es the plan of care for treatment of preterm labor with Malloryand answers her questions, and Mallory agrees to the plan toattempt to stop the contractions and delay delivery.What are your immediate priorities in nursing care for Mallory?Discuss the rationale for the priorities.State nursing diagnosis, expected outcome, and interventions related to this problem. List Mallory's risk factors for preterm labor.What teaching would you include? Within 10 minutes of starting the magnesium sulfate bolus, she reports feeling hot and flushed and feels burning at the IV site. After the magnesium sulfate bolus is complete, you start the magnesium sulfate infusion at 2 g per hour. At midnight, her contractions slow down to every 15 minutes or 4-5 contractions/hour. The FHR baseline is 140s with minimal variability and periodic accelerations. An ultrasound revealsthe fetus is vertex, estimated fetal weight (EFW) is 1,560 g, andfetal fibronectin is positive.What are the assessments for a woman treated for preterm labor on mag- nesium sulfate? Discuss the rationale for the assessments.What teaching would you include in the nursing action plan? At 7 A.M. when you sign off, Mallory is sleeping intermittently. Her contractions are 2 -3 per hour and the FHR is reassuring. Mallory is very concerned about giving birth to a premature baby.She is concerned that a baby will not survive at this gestation andstates, \"I have always wanted to be a mother and was so happywhen I was finally ready to have a baby and conceived with IVF.\"She is worried about not being able to return to work over thenext few days and weeks, as she has many active cases pendingover the next few weeks. She states that she is not ready for thebaby to come and has not set up the crib or finished the nursery.She feels guilty that she did not come to the hospital sooner andconsidered the backache as just part of pregnancy discomforts.Before you leave, you have requested Mallory be seen that day bythe neonatal clinical specialist to review status and care forneonates born prematurely and to have Mallory's sister tour theNICU.Detail the aspects of your psychosocial assessment for a woman with a high- risk pregnancy. Discuss the rationale for the assessment.Discuss nursing diagnosis, nursing actions, and expected outcomes related to this psychosocial assessment. The next night, you come onto your shift at 7 P.M. and care for Mallory again. She remains on the magnesium sulfate andappears to be tolerating the medication. Her magnesium level is5.6 mEq/L. She still feels warm and somewhat lethargic with soremuscles due to being in bed all day. She is due for her seconddose of betamethasone. Her I&O for the past 24 hours are: I: 2,500 mL; O: 2,300 mL. The plan is to wean her off themagnesium sulfate in the next 2 days and transfer her to theantenatal unit in the morning.Detail the aspects of your ongoing assessment for a woman treated with magnesium sulfate and diagnosed with preterm labor. Discuss the rationale for the assessment. At 0320 she reports feeling a gush of fluid from her vagina after a strong contraction. Between her legs is a large amount of clearfluid. The FHR is baseline 140s with minimal variability and acceler-ations. Mallory appears frightened and anxious. She is crying andher sister is at her side holding her hand and reassuring her.What are your immediate priorities in nursing care for Mallory?Discuss the rationale for the priorities. Within 45 minutes, her physician comes in to see Mallory and does an SVE. She is 5 cm, 90% effaced, and +1 station, and anultrasound reveals the fetus is vertex. The physician recommendsthey turn off the magnesium sulfate and anticipate a vaginalbirth because of the advanced preterm labor. Mallory agreeswith the plan.

The process by which this normally occurs iscalled labor. Childbirth is the period from the conclusion of the pregnancy to the start of extrauterine life of theinfant. This chapter discusses the intrapartum/childbirthprocess, including the factors affecting labor and delivery,progression of labor and delivery, and the nursing careinvolved.LABOR TRIGGERS The question of when and how labor begins has been studied foryears. The exact cause of the onset of labor is not completely under-stood, although there are several theories. Generally it is proposedthat labor is triggered by both maternal and fetal factors (Fig. 8-1)(Mattson & Smith, 2011; Simpson & O'Brien-Abel, 2013). Maternal Factors Uterine muscles are stretched to the threshold point, lead-ing to release of prostaglandins that stimulate contractions.3704_Ch08_185-232 03/10/13 2:49 PM Page 185UNIT 3 The Intrapartal Period 186 Increased pressure on the cervix stimulates the nerveplexus, causing release of oxytocin by the maternal pitu-itary gland, which then stimulates contractions. Estrogen increases, stimulating the uterine response. Progesterone, which has a quieting effect on the uterus, iswithdrawn, allowing estrogen to stimulate contractions. Oxytocin stimulates myometrial contractions. Oxytocinand prostaglandin work together to inhibit calcium bind-ing in muscle cells, raising intracellular calcium levels andactivating contractions. The oxytocin level surges from stretching of the cervix. Fetal Factors As the placenta ages it begins to deteriorate, triggeringinitiation of contractions. Prostaglandin synthesis by the fetal membranes and thedecidua stimulates contractions. Fetal cortisol, produced by fetal adrenal glands, rises andacts on the placenta to reduce progesterone that quietsthe uterus, and increases prostaglandin that stimulates theuterus to contract. THE PROCESS OF LABOR Signs of Impending Labor A few weeks before labor, changes occur that indicate thewoman's body is preparing for the onset of labor. Thesechanges are also referred to as premonitory signs of labor. These signs are:Lightening refers to the descent of the fetus into the true pelvis that occurs approximately 2 weeks before term infirst-time pregnancies. The woman may feel she canbreathe more easily but may experience urinary frequencyfrom increased bladder pressure. In subsequent pregnan-cies, this may not occur until labor begins. Braxton-Hicks contractions: These are irregular UCs that do not result in cervical change and are associatedwith false labor. These contractions begin to coordinatethe many muscle layers of the uterus to perform whentrue labor begins. Cervical changes: The cervix becomes soft (ripens) andmay become partially effaced and begin to dilate. Surge in energy: Some women may experience a burst ofenergy or feel the need to put everything in order; some-times referred to as nesting. Gastrointestinal changes: Less commonly, some womenmay experience a 1- to 3-pound weight loss and someexperience diarrhea, nausea, or indigestion preceding labor. Backache: The woman may experience low backache andsacroiliac discomfort due in part to the relaxation of thepelvic joints. Bloody show: The woman may experience a brownish or blood-tinged cervical mucus discharge referred to asbloody show. FACTORS AFFECTING LABOR Labor is defined by UCs that bring about effacement anddilation of the cervix. Factors that have been traditionallyidentified as the essential components in the outcome of laborand delivery include the \"4 Ps\": Powers (the contractions) Passage (the pelvis and birth canal) Passenger (the fetus) Psyche (the response of the woman)In more recent times a fifth \"P\" has been added: Position (maternal postures and physical positions tofacilitate labor) Powers Powers refer to the involuntary UCs of labor and the volun- tary pushing or bearing down powers that combine to propeland deliver the fetus and placenta from the uterus (seeChapter 9 for assessment of UCs). Uterine Contractions The uterine muscle, known as the myometrium, contractsand shortens during the first stage of labor. The uterus is divided into two segments known as theupper segment and the lower segment.The upper segment composes two-thirds of the uterus andcontracts to push the fetus down. The lower segment composes the lower third of theuterus and the cervix and is less active, allowing the cervixto become thinner and pulled upward. Uterine contractions are responsible for the dilation(opening) and effacement (thinning) of the cervix in thefirst stage of labor. Uterine contractions are rhythmic and intermittent. Each contraction has a resting phase or uterine relaxation period that allows the woman and uterine muscle a pausefor rest. This pause allows blood flow to the uterus and pla-centa that was temporarily reduced during the contractionLabor Triggers Maternal f actors Fetal factors Stretching of uterine m uscles Fetal cortisol changes Placenta agesEstrogen/progesterone changes Oxytocin release Release Figure Labor triggers.3704_Ch08_185-232 03/10/13 2:49 PM Page 186CHAPTER 8 Intrapartum Assessment and Interventions 187 phase. It is during this pause that much of the fetalexchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products occurs in the placenta. With every contraction, 500 mL of bloodleaves the utero-placental unit and moves back into mater-nal circulation. Uterine contractions are described in the following ways(Fig. 8-2):Frequency: Time from beginning of one contraction to the beginning of another. It is recorded in minutes (e.g., occur-ring every 3-4 minutes). Duration: Time from the beginning of a contraction to the end of the contraction. It is recorded in seconds (e.g., eachcontraction lasts 45-50 seconds). Intensity: Strength of the contraction. It is evaluated with palpation using the fingertips on maternal abdomen and isdescribed as: Mild: The uterine wall is easily indented during contraction. Moder ate: The uterine wall is resistant to indentation during a contr action. Str ong: The uterine wall cannot be indented during a contr action. There are three phases of a contraction (see Fig. 8-2):Increment phase: Ascending or buildup of the contractionthat begins in the fundus and spreads throughout theuterus; the longest part of the contraction. Acme phase: Peak of intensity but the shortest part of thecontraction Decrement phase: Descending or relaxation of the uterinemuscle Contractions facilitate cervical changes (Fig. 8-3A, B, C).Dilation and effacement occurs during the first stage oflabor when UCs push the presenting part of the fetustoward the cervix, causing it to open and thin out as themusculofibrous tissue of the cervix is drawn upwards (seeFig. 8-3B).Dilation is the enlargement or opening of the cervical os. The cervix dilates from closed (or <1 cm diameter) to10 cm diameter (see Fig. 8-3C ). When the cervix reaches 10 cm dilation, it is consideredfully or complet e ly dilated and can no longer be palpated on vaginal examination. Effacement is the shortening and thinning of the cervix (Fig. 8-3A, B, C). Before the onset of labor the cervix is 2 to 3 cm longand appr oximately 1 cm thick (Fig. 8-3A). The degree of effacement is measured in percentageand goes fr om 0% in first-time pregnancy.Effacement and dilation progression of the cervix occurstogether in subsequent pregnancies. Bearing-down powers occur once the cervix is fully dilated (10 cm), and the woman feels the urge to push; shewill involuntarily bear down. The urge to push is triggeredby the Ferguson reflex, activated when the presenting partstretches the pelvic floor muscles. Stretch receptors are activated, releasing oxytocin, stimulating contractions(Simpson & O'Brien-Abel, 2013). The bearing-down pow-ers are enhanced when the woman contracts her abdominalmuscles and pushes. Passage The passage includes the bony pelvis and the soft tissues of the cervix, pelvic floor, vagina, and introitus (external openingto the vagina). Although all of these anatomical areas play arole in the birth of the fetus, it is the maternal pelvis that isthe greatest determinate in the vaginal delivery of the fetus.The assessment of the size and shape of the pelvis is impor-tant. Assessment of the pelvis is performed manually throughpalpation with a vaginal exam by the care provider duringpregnancy.

Pelvis Types of bony pelvis (Fig. 8-4):Gynecoid (most common and found in about 50% ofwomen) Android Anthropoid Platypelloid (least common type and found in about 3% ofwomen) The anatomical structure of the pelvis divided into (Fig. 8-5B):False pelvis, which is the shallow upper section of the pelvis. True pelvis, which is the lower part of the pelvis and con-sists of three planes, the inlet, the midpelvis, and the outlet.The measurement of these three planes defines the obstetriccapacity of the pelvis. The pelvic joints include the symphysis pubis, the rightand the left sacroiliac joints, and the sacrococcygeal joints. The actions of the hormones estrogen and relaxin duringpregnancy soften cartilage and increase elasticity of theligaments, thus allowing room for the fetal head. Station refers to the relationship of the ischial spines to the presenting part of the fetus and assists in assessing for fetaldescent during labor (Fig. 8-6). Station 0 is the narrowestdiameter the fetus must pass through during a vaginal birth. Soft Tissue The soft tissue of the cervix effaces and dilates, allowingthe descending fetus into the vagina. The soft tissue of the pelvic floor muscles helps the fetusin an anterior rotation as it passes through the birth canal. The soft tissue of the vagina expands to allow passage 8 Intrapartum Assessment and Interventions 189 Passenger The passenger is the fetus. It is the fetus and its relationship to the passageway that is the major factor in the birthingprocess. The relationship between the fetus and the passagewayincludes fetal skull, fetal attitude, fetal lie, fetal presentation,fetal position, and fetal size. At the onset of labor, the positionof the fetus with respect to the birth canal is critical (Cunninghamet al., 2010). In general, in the United States, when a fetus is in a position other than cephalic (head first), a cesarean delivery isconsidered. Size of the fetus alone is less significant in thebirthing process than the relationship among fetal size, position,and pelvic dimensions (Mattson & Smith, 2011). Fetal Skull The fetal head usually accounts for the largest portion ofthe fetus to come through the birth canal. Bones and membranous spaces help the skull to moldduring labor and birth. Molding is the ability of the fetal head to change shape to accommodate/fit through the maternal pelvis (Fig. 8-7). The fetal skull is composed of two parietal bones, twotemporal bones, the frontal bone, and the occipital bone(Fig. 8-8 A).The biparietal diameter (BPD), 9.25 cm, is the largest transverse measurement and an important indicator ofhead size (see Fig. 8-8 B). The membranous space between the bones (sutures) and thefontanels (intersections of these sutures) allows the skullbones to overlap and mold to fit through the birth canal(see Fig. 8-8A and B). Sutures are used to identify the positioning of the fetalhead during a vaginal exam. By identifying the anteriorFigure 8-6 Station of presenting part: Fetal head in rela- tion to ischial spines. Figure 8-5 Pelvic structures. of 189UNIT 3 The Intrapartal Period fontanel in relationship to the woman's pelvis, the exam-iner can determine the position of the head and the degreeof rotation that has occurred. Fetal Attitude or Posture Fetal attitude or posture is the relationship of fetal parts toone another. This is noted by the flexion or extension of thefetal joints (Fig. 8-9).At term, the fetus's back becomes convex and the headflexed such that the chin is against the chest. Thisresults in a rounded appearance with the chin flexedforward on the chest, arms crossed over the thorax, thethighs flexed on the abdomen, and the legs flexed atthe knees.With proper fetal attitude, the head is in complete flexion in a vertex presentation and passes more easilythrough the true pelvis. Fetal Lie Fetal lie refers to the long axis (spine) of the fetus in relation-ship to the long axis (spine) of the woman.The two primary lies are longitudinal and transverse (Fig. 8-10).In the longitudinal lie, the long axes of the fetus and themother are parallel (most common). In the transverse lie, the long axis of the fetus is perpendi-cular to the long axis of the mother. A fetus cannot be delivered vaginally in the transverse lie. Presentation Fetal presentation is determined by the part or pole of thefetus that first enters the pelvic inlet. There are three mainpresentations (Fig. 8-11):Cephalic (head first) (Fig. 8-11A) Breech (pelvis first) (Fig. 8-11B) Shoulder (shoulder first) (Fig. 8-11C) Presenting Part The presenting part is the specific fetal structure lying nearest to the cervix. It is determined by the attitude or posture of the fetus.Sinciput(brow)FrontalboneAnteriorfontanelle Mentum(chin)Vertex Pariet al cm)Figure 8-7 Molding of fetal head.

The degree of flexion or extension of the head and neck fur-ther classifies cephalic presentations. Vertex presentation indicates that the head is sharplyfl exed and the chin is touching the thorax. The denomi- nator is the occiput (Fig. 8-12A).Frontum or brow presentation indicates partial exten-sion of the neck with the br ow as the pr esenting part. The denominator is the frontum (Fig. 8-12B). Face presentation indicates that the neck is sharplyextended and the back of the head (occiput) is arching to the f etal back. The denominator is the mentum-chin (Fig. 8-12C). Breech presentations: The presenting part is the buttockand/or feet (Fig. 8-13).Breech presentations are further classified into: see newsuggested pictures Complete breech: Complete f lexion of the thighs and the legs extending over the anterior surfaces of the body(see Fig. 8-13A ) Frank breech: Complete flexion of thighs and legs (see Fig. 8-13B) Footling breech : Ext ension of one or both thighs and legs so that one or both f eet are presenting (see Fig. 8-13C) Transverse presentation: The presenting part is usuallythe shoulder (see Fig. 8-9C).This usually is associated with a transverse lie. Compound presentation: The fetus assumes a uniqueposture usually with the arm or hand presenting along-side the presenting part.AB C Figure 8-11 Fetal presentation. A. Cephalic. B. Breech. C.

The occiput is the specific fetal structure for a cephalicpresentation (see Fig. 8-11A). The sacrum is the specific fetal structure for a breechpresentation (see Fig. 8-11B). The acromion is the specific fetal structure for a shoulderpresentation (see Fig. 8-11C). The mentum is the specific fetal structure for the facepresentation (see Fig. 8-12C). Position is designated by a three-letter abbreviation (Fig. 8-14):First letter: Designates location of presenting part to theleft (L) or right (R) of the woman's pelvis (Fig. 8-14). Second letter: Designates the specific fetal (O), (M), and shoulder (A)(Fig. 8-14). Third letter: Designates the relationship of the presentingfetal part to the woman's pelvis such as anterior (A), posterior (P), or transverse (T) (Fig. 8-14). Psyche Nursing care of the woman during the intrapartum periodaddresses not only the physical aspect of care but also thepsychosocial aspect to result in woman's wellness and satis-faction. Preparation of childbirth, both physically and mentally, helps the woman manage labor. This preparationpromotes in the woman a sense of security and safety. Awoman's experience and satisfaction during the labor andbirthing process can be enhanced when there is a coordina-tion of collaborative goals between the woman and healthcare personnel in the plan of care (Perla, 2002). This is acritical part that influences her self-esteem, self-confidence,her relationship to others, and a general view she holds of life. Factors that influence the woman's coping mechanism include her culture, expectations, a strong support system, andtype of support during labor.CultureCulture influences the woman's reaction to labor expecta-tions and how she interacts with others. Cultural influencesmay be most apparent in the newly immigrated woman.The nurse needs to be culturally aware and sensitive to theneeds and practices of the individual. Nurses need to integrate the woman's cultural and reli-gious values, beliefs, and practices to provide a mutuallyacceptable plan of care. When the woman feels that theplan of care is one she is actively involved in and inte-grates her cultural and/or religious values, beliefs, andpractices with the decision making, her feeling of safetyand control are further facilitated (Cultural Awareness:Culture and Birth Traditions). Cultural Awareness: Culture and Birth Traditions Giving birth is a pivotal life event, and the meaning of birthand parenthood is culturally defined (Moore, Moos, &Callister, 2010). Culture influences all aspects of a woman'sresponse to labor and impacts factors such as:Who is with the woman in labor, their role, and whoparticipates in decision making Preferences for use of pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain management in labor Who they want to care for them in relation to gender andmodesty How they respond to labor, so the nurse needs to help women formulate their concerns, priorities, and decisions.Behaviors in birth are complex and personal. It is impor- tant for nurses to have a general understanding of birthpractices of the groups with which they work (Bar-Yam,1994). Some strategies for providing culturally sensitive careare presented in Chapter 5 and in the Critical Component:Strategies for Nurses: Improving Culturally ResponsiveCare in Labor & Birth. By identifying the patient's beliefsand being sensitive to her experiences of the health care system, nurses can provide individualized care to her and her support system and provide information when there aredifferences encountered.Occiput posterior Occiput anteriorROP 3704_Ch08_185-232 03/10/13 2:49 PM Page 192CHAPTER 8 Intrapartum Assessment and Interventions 193 ExpectationsExpectations for the birth experience are related to howchildbirth is viewed by the woman (e.g., as a naturalprocess or as a stressful or threatening experience). Thenurse should review the woman's expectations to help alle-viate fear and to help set realistic goals. Unrealistic expectations can cause an increase in mater-nal anxiety. Past experience and complications of pregnancy, labor, andbirth strongly influence women's expectations of labor andresponse to labor. Women who have experienced a negative previousbirthing e xperience are at risk for increased anxiety; women who experienced a positive previous birthingexperience have lower anxiety levels. Women that are recent immigrants may have had verydiff erent birth experiences in other countries, and that influences their expectations, hopes, and fears. Current pregnancy experience with difficulty conceiving,an unplanned pregnancy, or a high-risk pregnancy mayincrease a woman's anxiety and fears. Support systemThe woman's perception of being able to maintain controlduring labor and delivery is an important contributingfactor to a positive and favorable evaluation of childbirth.CRITICAL COMPONENT Strategies for Nurses: Improving Culturally ResponsiveCare in Labor & Birth Learn the traditions of the cultural groups you care for andthe specic preferences of each woman and her family. Recognize there are sub-cultures within cultures. Listen to the woman and her support persons and help themnd meaningful and acceptable support activities. Identify who the client calls \"family.\" Use the beliefs, values, customs, and expectations of thewoman to shape her plan of care for labor and birth. Include notes on cultural preferences and family strengthsand resources as part of all intake and ongoing assessments,and nursing care plans. Instead of focusing on technology, look beyond the routineand appreciate the needs of all women. Develop linguistic skills related to your client population. Learn to use nonverbal communication in an appropriate way. Learn about the communication patterns of various cultures. Recognize and acknowledge your own belief system whilemaintaining an open attitude. Examine the biases and assumptions you hold about differ-ent cultures. Avoid preconceptions and cultural stereotyping. Recognize all care is given within the context of many cultures. Advocate for organizational change that is flexible to culturalvariations. (Adapted from Simpson & O'Brien-Abel, 2013; Amidi-Nouri, 2011; Moore, Moos, &Callister, 2010.)This includes control of pain perception, control over emotions and actions, and being able to influence decisionswhile being an active participant (Mackey, 1995). Studies have shown that with a support person, be it afamily member, friend, doula, or professional such as anurse, the patient experiences a decrease in anxiety and hasa feeling of being in more control. This results in a decreasein interventions, a significantly lower level of pain, andan enhanced overall maternal satisfaction (Hodnett,Gates, Hofmeyr, & Sakala, 2007). Nursing care of women in labor should incorporate the following types of support and interventions: Emotional support, including continuous presence,reassur ance, and praise Information about labor progress and advice regardingcoping techniques Comfort measures (e.g., comforting touch, massage,warm baths/shower s , promoting adequate fluid intake and output) Advocacy, including assisting the woman in articulatingher wishes to other s Evidence-Based Practice: Supportive Care forAdolescents in Labor Adolescents have a very different view of labor & birth as theystruggle with self-identity and self-esteem. It can pose a chal-lenge for providers and nurses to work with adolescents to pro-mote a positive birthing experience. Nurses need to have anunderstanding of adolescent development, expectations, andneeds to provide a positive birthing experience. According toSauls (2010), four themes became apparent based on feedbackof over 180 adolescents in three tertiary centers during theirpostpartum interviews: Respectful nurse caring: during interactions be kind, friendly,and make her feel welcome. Include her in decision making,informing her of her options related to her care. Assistance with pain control: Assist her with pain manage-ment options with explanations of both pharmacologicaland non-pharmacological. Assess often her ability to manageher pain. Nursing support of the adolescent's support person: Payattention to her support person's emotional and physicalneeds. Encourage them as they work through labor, includ-ing them in explanations and plan of care discussions. Childbirth guidance: Orient her and her support system to hospital facilities and to the birthing process, anticipatingquestions and explaining procedures. Answer questions truth-fully and in a manner that is appropriate for the age group. Sauls, D. J. (2010). Promoting a Positive Childbirth Experience for Adolescents. Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, and Neonatal Nursing, 39, 703-712. Labor supportSince the middle of the 20th century, a majority of womenhave given birth in a hospital rather than at home, evenin poorer, less developed countries. Access to continuous careand support during labor has become the exception rather3704_Ch08_185-232 03/10/13 2:49 PM Page 193UNIT 3 The Intrapartal Period 194 than the routine in the hospital setting. Concerns about theconsequent dehumanization of women's birth experienceshave resulted in demands for a return to continuous, one-to-one support by women for women during labor(Fig. 8-15) (Evidence-Based Practice: Continuous LaborSupport for Women During Childbirth). Two complementary theoretical explanations have beenoffered for the effects of labor support on childbirth out-comes (Hodnett, Gates, Hofmeyr, & Sakala, labor support enhances laborphysiology and woman's feelings of control and competence. First theory: During labor women may be uniquely vul-nerable to unfamiliar environmental influences; currentobstetric care frequently subjects women to institutionalroutines, high rates of intervention, unfamiliar personnel,and lack of privacy. These conditions may have an adverse effect on theprogr ess of labor and on the development of feelings of competence and confidence; this may in turn impairadjustment to parenthood and establishment of breast-feeding, and increase the risk of depression. This response may, to some extent, be buffered by theprovision of sup port and companionship during labor. Second theory describes two pathways: enhanced passage ofthe fetus through the pelvis and soft tissues, and decreasedstress response (Hodnett, 2002). Enhanced fetopelvic relationships may be accomplishedby encouraging mobility and ef fective use of gravity, sup- porting women to assume their preferred positions andrecommending specific positions for specific situations. Studies of the relationships among fear and anxiety, thestress r esponse, and pregnancy complications have shown that anxiety during labor is associated with highlevels of the stress hormone epinephrine in the blood,which may lead to abnormal fetal heart rate (FHR) pat-terns in labor, decreased uterine contractility, a longeractive labor phase with regular well-established contrac-tions, and low Apgar scores (Lederman, 1986).Emotional support, information and advice, comfortmeasur es, and advocacy may r educe anxiety and fear and associated adverse effects during labor. Anxiety (a sense of uneasiness in response to a vague unspe- cific threat) can interfere with labor and increase nauseaand crying, as well as interfering with the ability to focus. Fear (a painful, uneasy feeling in response to an identifi- able threat) can be fear related to the unknown, fear ofinjury to self and fetus, or fear of pain. Fear can decreaseUCs and enhance the perception of pain. Procedures andan unfamiliar environment can result in a sense of loss ofcontrol and feeling of helplessness. Women in labor can feelabandoned (Mattson & Smith, 2011). Nurses can help and support women to be actively involvedin their own care by allowing time for discussion, listeningto worries and concerns, and offering information to helpwomen gain increased self-determination in the context ofcare (Nordgren & Fridlund, 2001). Position Discussion of the influence on labor often includes a fifth \"P,\"referred to as maternal position during labor and birth. Thewoman's position has an effect on both the anatomical andphysiological adaptations to labor (Fig. 8-16).During the first stage of labor, an upright position (walking, sitting, kneeling, or squatting) and/or a lateralposition is encouraged (Fig. 8-17A).These positions are used to decrease the compression of thematernal descending aorta and ascending vena cava thatcould result in a compromised cardiac output. Compressionof these vessels can lead to supine hypotension, resulting indecreased placental perfusion. Figure 8-15 Woman receiving labor support from her nurse. Figure 8-16 Woman walking in labor with her nurse. 3704_Ch08_185-232 03/10/13 2:49 PM Page 194CHAPTER 8 Intrapartum Assessment and Interventions 195 The upright position has shown benefits of aiding in thedescent of the infant and more effective contractions thatresult in shorter labor (Gupta, Hofmeyr, & Smyth, 2004). Frequent position changes are associated with a reductionof fatigue, an increase of comfort, and improved circulationto both mother and fetus. During the second stage of labor, the upright positionhas been shown to increase the pelvic outlet and betteraligns the fetus with the pelvic inlet (Fig. 8-17B) (Simkin& Ancheta, 2000). The position most used in births in the United States isthe lithotomy position, which allows for provider visuali-zation and control during the delivery process. ONSET OF LABOR As the woman comes closer to term pregnancy, the uterusbecomes more sensitive to oxytocin and the contractionsincrease in frequency and intensity. This can be an anxioustime for the woman and family in trying to determine if sheneeds to proceed to the birthing center. An understanding oftrue versus false labor can help to alleviate some of these fears. True Labor Versus False Labor True labor contractions occur at regular intervals and increasein frequency, duration, and intensity (Fig. 8-18).True labor contractions bring about changes in cervicaleffacement and dilation. False labor is irregular contractions with little or no cervi-cal changes. Assessment of Rupture of the Membranes (ROM) Spontaneous rupture of the membranes (SROM) may occur before the onset of labor but typically occurs during labor.Once the membranes have ruptured, the protective barrier toinfection is lost, and ideally the woman should deliver within24 hours to reduce the risk of infection to herself and her fetus.

Use of AmniSure testing kit. The AmniSure ROM Test is a rapid, non-invasive immunoassay that aids clinicians with the diagnosis ofROM in pregnant women with signs and symptoms suggestive of thecondition. According to published data it is ~99% accurate.Hodnett, E., Gates, S., Hofmeyr, G., & Sakala, C. (2007). Continuous support forwomen during childbirth. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2007, Issue 3, Art. No. CD003766. DOI: 10.1002/1465185.CD003766.pbb2. In recent decades in hospitals worldwide, continuous supportduring labor has become the exception rather than the routine.Concerns about the consequent dehumanization of women'sbirth experiences have led to calls for a return to continuous sup-port by women for women during labor. Objective of Systematic ReviewPrimary: To assess the effects, on women and their babies, of continuous, one-to-one intrapartum support compared with theusual care. Secondary: To determine whether the effects of contin-uous support are influenced by (1) routine practices and policies inthe birth environment that may affect a woman's autonomy, free-dom of movement, and ability to cope with labor; (2) whether thecaregiver is a member of the staff of the institution; and (3) whetherthe continuous support begins early or later in labor. Selection CriteriaAll published and unpublished randomized controlled trials comparing continuous support during labor with usual care. Main ResultsSixteen trials involving 13,391 women met inclusion criteria and provided usable outcome data. Primary comparison: womenwho had continuous intrapartum support were likely to have aslightly shorter labor, and were more likely to have a spontaneousvaginal birth and less likely to have intrapartum analgesia or toreport dissatisfaction with their childbirth experiences. Subgroupanalyses: In general, continuous intrapartum support was asso-ciated with greater benefits when the provider was not a memberof the hospital staff, or when it began early in labor and in set-tings in which epidural analgesia was not routinely available. SummaryContinuous support in labor increased the chance of a spon- taneous vaginal birth, had no identified adverse effects, andwomen were more satisfied. Supportive care during labor may involve emotional sup- port, comfort measures, information, and advocacy. These mayEvidence-Based Practice: Continuous Support for Women During Childbirth enhance normal labor processes as well as women's feelings ofcontrol and competence, and thus reduce the need for obstetricintervention. The review of studies included 16 trials from 11 countries, involving more than 13,000 women in a widerange of settings and circumstances. Women who received continuous labor support were more likely to give birth \"spontaneously,\" i.e., give birth with neither cesarean birth norvacuum nor forceps. In addition, women were less likely to usepain medications, were more likely to be satisfied, and hadslightly shorter labors. Common elements of this care include emotional support (con- tinuous presence, reassurance, and praise); information aboutlabor progress; advice regarding coping techniques and comfortmeasures (comforting touch, massage, warm baths/showers, pro-moting adequate fluid intake and output); and advocacy (helpingthe woman articulate her wishes to others). A systematic review examining factors associated with women's satisfaction with the childbirth experience suggests thatcontinuous support can make a substantial contribution to thissatisfaction. When women evaluate their experience, four factorspredominate: the amount of support from caregivers, the qualityof relationships with caregivers, being involved with decision-making, and having high expectations or having experiences thatexceed expectations (Hodnett, 2002). Authors' Conclusions and Implications for PracticeContinuous support during labor should be the norm, rather than the exception. All women should be allowed and encour-aged to have support people with them continuously duringlabor. In general, continuous support from a caregiver duringlabor appears to confer the greatest benefits when the provider isnot an employee of the institution, when epidural analgesia is notroutinely used, and when support begins in early labor. Every effort should be made to ensure that women's birth environments are empowering, are not stressful, afford privacy,communicate respect, and are not characterized by routine inter-ventions that add risk without clear benefit.

There is a higher risk of umbilical cord prolapse when thepresenting part is not engaged. Assess the amniotic fluid for color, amount, and odor.Normal amniotic fluid is clear or cloudy with a normalodor that is similar to that of ocean water or the loam of aforest floor. Fluid can be meconium stained and this needs to be report-ed to the care provider, as this may be an indication offetal compromise in utero. Document the date and time of SROM, characteristic offluid, and FHR. Guidelines for Going to the Birthing Facility By law, all pregnant women have access to medical careregardless of their ability to pay (Box 8-1). Ongoing communication with your pregnancy careprovider will help assure a smooth transition from preg-nancy to labor management. By discussing when to go tothe birthing facility before labor happens, women willhave less anxiety and be more prepared for when laborbegins. When to go to the birthing facility dependsgreatly on the past history of pregnancies, location of thebirth center, and risk status of the pregnancy.A B Figure 8-19 Assessment of rupture of membranes A.

BOX 8-1 EMERGENCY MEDICAL TREATMENT AND ACTIVE LABOR ACT The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act(EMTALA) is a federal regulation that was enacted to ensuretreatment for a woman seeking care in an emergency or if shethinks she is in labor, regardless of her ability to pay. Nurses whowork in the labor and delivery unit(s) of the hospital need to befamiliar with EMTALA regulations (Angelini & Mahlmeister,2005). In general, the criteria for admission to the hospital for labor are cervical dilation to 3-4 cm and/or ruptured membranes (Cunningham et al., 2010). A general rule of thumb for first-time pregnancy with no risk factor is to wait until contractions are 5 minutesapart, lasting 60 seconds, and are regular. The woman should go to the birthing center when:The membrane ruptures, or \"bag of waters\" break. The woman is experiencing intense pain. There is an increase of bloody show. MECHANISM OF LABOR The postponed changes in the presenting part required to navigate the birth canal constitute the mechanism of labor.These mechanisms are cardinal movements of labor (Fig. 8-20).Engagement: When the greatest diameter of the fetalhead passes through the pelvic inlet; can occur late inpregnancy or early in labor (see Fig. 8-20A) Descent: Movement of the fetus through the birthcanal during the first and second stages of labor (seeFig. 8-20A) Flexion: When the chin of the fetus moves toward the fetal chest; occurs when the descending head meets resistance from maternal tissues; results in the smallest fetal diameter to the maternal pelvicdimensions; normally occurs early in labor (see Fig. 8-20A) Internal rotation: When the rotation of the fetal headaligns the long axis of the fetal head with the long axis ofthe maternal pelvis; occurs mainly during the secondstage of labor (see Fig. 8-20B) Extension: Facilitated by resistance of the pelvic floorthat causes the presenting part to pivot beneath the pubicsymphysis and the head to be delivered; occurs during thesecond stage of labor (see Fig. 8-20C) External rotation: During this movement, the sagittalsuture moves to a transverse diameter and the shouldersalign in the anteroposterior diameter. The sagittal suturemaintains alignment with the fetal trunk as the trunknavigates through the pelvis (see Fig. 8-20D). Expulsion: The shoulders and remainder of the body aredelivered (see Fig. 8-20E).3704_Ch08_185-232 03/10/13 2:49 PM Page 197UNIT 3 The Intrapartal Period 198 STAGES OF LABOR AND CHILDBIRTH Labor or parturition is the process in which the fetus, placenta, and membranes are expelled through the uterus.The care of women and families during labor and deliveryrequires astute and ongoing assessments of the bio-psycho-social adaptation of the woman and fetus. Becausechildbirth is a natural process, care should move forward on a continuum from noninvasive to least invasive interven-tion and from non-pharmacological to pharmacologicalinterventions according to the desires of the woman andassessment of health care providers based on individual clin-ical situations (Simpson & O'Brien-Abel, 2013). See CriticalComponent: Care Practices That Support and PromoteNormal Physiologic Birth. In the United States in 2010, 98.8% of all births were deliv- ered in hospitals.

(2008). Promoting, Protecting & Supporting NormalBirth: A look at the Evidence. Journal of Obstetrics, Gynecologic & Neonatal Nursing, 37,94-105.3704_Ch08_185-232 03/10/13 2:49 PM Page 198CHAPTER 8 Intrapartum Assessment and Interventions 199 67.0% were in a residence (home) and 28.0% were in a freestand-ing birthing center. Doctors of medicine (M.D.s) attended the vast majority (86.3%) of hospitals births in 2010, followed bycertified nurse midwives (CNMs) (7.6%), and Doctors ofOsteopathy (D.O.s) (5.7%) (Martin, Hamilton, Ventura,Osterman, Wilson, & Mathews, 2012). Because most babies aredelivered in the hospital by physicians, nurses in the intrapartalsetting have a key role in providing comprehensive and individ-ualized care for women and their families. To provide this care,nurses must understand the process of labor, birth, and postpar-tum. By understanding the stages and phases of labor, the nursecan facilitate, assist, and provide care for the woman, the fetus,and her support system (see Concept Map and Figure 8-21). Labor and birth is divided into four stages (Table 8-1): The first stage begins with onset of labor and ends with complete cervical dilation. The second stage begins with complete dilation of cervix and ends with delivery of baby. The third stage begins after delivery of baby and ends with delivery of placenta. The fourth stage begins after delivery of the placenta and is completed 4 hours later; it is the immediate postpartumperiod. First Stage The first stage of labor is defined as the progression of cervicalchanges. This stage is divided into three phases: latent phase,active phase, and transition. Characteristics of the first stageof labor are:It begins with onset of true labor and ends with completecervical dilation (10 cm) and complete effacement (100%). Stage 1 is longest stage, typically lasting 12 hours forprimigravidas and 8 hours for multigravidas. There are normally tremendous variations in lengths oflabor (Cunningham et al., 2010).The bag of waters or fetal membranes usually rupturesduring this stage. The woman's cardiac output increases. The woman's pulse may increase. Gastrointestinal motility decreases, which leads to increasein gastric emptying time (Mattson & Smith, 2011). The woman experiences pain associated with UCs thatresult in the dilation and effacement of the cervix. The first stage has three phases: the latent, active, andtransition phases (see Table 8-1). Assessment Assessment during all phases of the first stage of labor includes:Maternal vital signs The woman's response to labor and pain FHR and UCs Cervical changes Fetal position and descent in the pelvis Nursing Actions Nursing actions during all phases of the first stage of labor arerelated to:Diet and hydrationTypically once admitted to the hospital, medical orderslimit oral intake to clear liquids The WHO recommends women dictate their oral intake ofcarbohydrates to decrease maternal ketosis. (Sharts-Hopko,2010) Activity and restEncouraging frequent position changes and upright posi-tions assists labor progression, facilitates fetal descent, anddecreases pain perception. EliminationFrequent emptying of bowel and bladder assists in comfortof the mother, provides more pelvic room as baby descends,and decreases pressure and injury to the urethra and bowel. ComfortProviding comfort measures and therapies facilitates laborprogress, decreases pain perception, and supports maternalcoping mechanisms to manage the labor process.

Latent Phase The latent phase, is the early and slower part of labor with an average length of 9 hours for primiparous and 5 hours for mul-tiparous women. Women in this phase are usually both excitedand apprehensive about the start of labor. They are talkative andable to relax with the contractions. Many women choose to stayhome during this phase, although some women are admitted tothe birth center during this time. Indications for admittance tothe birth center are if there is cervical change/ROM or fetalintolerance of labor. Most can go back home to a more relaxedsetting at this stage and return to the birth center when laborprogresses. Awaiting admission until active labor decreases theneed for medical interventions, and facilitates fetal descent andlabor support of the family to the patient.Characteristics of this phase are: Cervical dilation from 0 to 3 cm with effacement from 0 to 40%. Contractions occur every 5-10 minutes, lasting 30-45 seconds, and mild intensity. Women often describethem as feeling like strong menstrual cramps. Medical Interventions Order laboratory tests, which may include completeblood count (CBC), urinalysis, and possible drugscreening. Order IV or saline lock. Order intermittent fetal monitoring or continuous fetaland uterine monitoring.3704_Ch08_185-232 03/10/13 2:49 PM Page 205UNIT 3 The Intrapartal Period 206 CRITICAL COMPONENT Calm environment (dim lighting, quiet, music, minimize inter-ruptions) Informational Support Provide information on the progress of labor. Explain all procedures. Communicate in lay language so the woman and her familyunderstand. Offer advice Use interpreters as needed. Advocacy Support decisions made by the woman and her family. Ensure respect for the woman's decisions. Manage the environment, which includes visitors. Translate the woman's wishes to others Support of the Partner and Family Offer support and praise. Role model therapeutic behaviors. Assist the partner with food and rest. Provide breaks if desired or needed.Nonpharmacological Strategies for Nurses and ComfortMeasures in Labor Labor support is a repertoire of techniques used to help women withthe process of childbirth (Wood & Carr, 2003). Providing supportand comfort is one of the primary activities of nurses and includes:Emotional Support Sustaining physical presence, eye contact Verbal encouragement, reassurance, and praise Listening to woman and family Distraction Physical Support Comfort measures such as ice chips, fluids, food, and painmedications Hygiene including mouth care, pericare, and changing soiledlinens Assistance with position changes and ambulation Reassuring touch, massage Application of heat and cold Hydrotherapy in shower and tub. Hydrotherapy is safe andeffective as a complementary pain management therapy (Stark& Miller, 2009). (Wood & Carr, 2003; Burke, 2013) Nursing Actions (see Clinical Pathway and Concept Map) Admit to the labor unit and orient the woman, her part-ner, and family to the labor room. The review of the prenatal record will give informationfrom pregnancy onset to the present. The prenatal recordshould include: all lab tests and ultrasounds (for estimateddate of delivery (EDD) and placental location) as well asany prior obstetrical history (pregnancy, births, abortions,and living children) should be included. A review of aller-gies and medications, trends in vital signs and weightgain, chronic conditions, or pregnancy-related complica-tions will also be a part of the record. Biochemical andinfectious disease laboratory test results; for example,Group B streptococcus (GBS) status, are also included Complete labor and delivery admission record (Fig. 8-22). Review childbirth plan and discuss the woman's expectations.Woman may present with a birth plan: Some providersand childbirth educators encourage the family to thinkabout how they \"see\" the labor and birth process. It is awish list that allows the woman to express her wishesand preferences and communicate with care providersduring her prenatal appointments. This discussionshould include hospital policies and medical interven-tions. Review this plan with the woman during theadmission process and clarify what you can and cannotprovide. This will facilitate open communication andshow respect for her expectations. Teach and reinforce relaxation and breathing techniques.Support what they have been practicing or teach techniquesas needed to decrease pain and anxiety. Obtain laboratory tests as per orders.Provides information on patient status and health. Start IV or insert saline lock, if ordered.Provides access for fluids and or medications if needed. Review the woman's report of onset of labor. Assess and record the following (see Fig. 8-22 andClinical Pathway and Concept Map):Maternal vital signs FHR Uterine contractions Cervical dilation and effacement; and fetal presentation,position, and station by performing a sterile vaginalexamination (SVE) (Fig. 8-24, see Box 8-2). Status of membranes Amniotic fluid for color, amount, consistency, and odor Vaginal bleeding or bloody show for amount and charac-teristics of vaginal discharge Fetal position with Leopold maneuver (Fig. 8-25, see Box 8-3) Deep tendon reflexes Signs of edema Heart and lung sounds3704_Ch08_185-232 03/10/13 2:49 PM Page 206CHAPTER 8 Intrapartum Assessment and Interventions 207 Emotional status Pain and discomfort Review laboratory results, note blood Rh status hematocritand hemoglobin and dipstick urine for glucose and protein. Review GBS status, if GBS positive intrapartum IVantibiotic prophylaxis is given.Group B streptococci (GBS), also known as Streptococcusagalactiae, is an important cause of perinatal morbidityand mortality. Between 10% and 30% of pregnantwomen are colonized with GBS in the vagina or rectum.Implementation of national guidelines for intrapartumantibiotic prophylaxis since the 1990s has resulted in anapproximate 80% reduction in the incidence of early-onset neonatal sepsis due to GBS. Vertical transmissionof GBS during labor or delivery may result in invasiveinfection in the newborn during the first week of life.Penicillin remains the drug of choice, with ampicillin asan alternative (American college of Obstetrics &Gynecology, 2011). Intrapartum GBS prophylaxis (CDC, 2010) is indicated:Previous infant with invasive GBS disease GBS bacteria during and trimester of current pregnancy Positive GBS vaginal-rectal screening culture in lategestation during current pregnancy Unknown GBS status at onset of labor with <37 weeksgestation, or ROM >18 hours, or temperature > 100.4\u00b0For >38.0\u00b0C or intrapartum NAAT positive for GBS Document allergies, history of illness, and last foodintake. Encourage fluid intake; food may or may not berestricted. Provide comfort measures (see Critical Component:Non-pharmacologic Strategies for Nurses and ComfortMeasures in Labor). Encourage the woman to walk as much as possible by:Explaining the importance of walking in facilitating laborprogression and fetal descent and rotation and in makingUCs more efficient Walking with the woman, which can provide a comfortingand reassuring presence and distraction Assess cultural needs and incorporate beliefs in the nurs-ing care and delivery plan. Establish a therapeutic relationship through active listen-ing and providing labor support (Box 8-4). Incorporate understanding of the couple's maturitylevel, educational level, and previous experience intonursing care. Review the labor plan with the woman and her partner. Inquire about concerns and questions the womanand/or her partner have concerning the labor and birth process. Provide clear explanations and updates on progress.Above noted nursing actions will provide information to the nurse to facilitate teaching moments, decrease patientanxiety, and support the plan of care. Figure 8-24 Sterile vaginal exam.Teamwork and Collaboration: Leading HealthCare Organizations Issue Recommendationsfor Quality Patient Care in Labor and Delivery Although the infant mortality rate in the United Statesdeclined in 2010, the U.S. rate remains higher than mostEuropean nations. In addition, U.S. health care providershave seen an increase in pregnancy complications. Thesetrends, along with the recognition that collaborationamong physicians, midwives, and nurses is essential topositive health outcomes, prompted professional organi-zations from the nation's leading obstetrics, family medi-cine, and pediatric organizations to develop joint recom-mendations. The \"Call to Action\" includes recommenda-tions for health care providers and administrators: Ensure that patient-centered care and patient safety are organizational priorities that guide decisions for policiesand practices. Foster a culture of openness by promoting the active communication of good outcomes and opportunities forimprovement. Develop forums to facilitate communication and track issues of concern. Provide resources for clinicians to be trained in the prin- ciples of teamwork, safety, and shared decision-making. Develop methods to systematically track and evaluate care processes and outcomes. Facilitate cross-departmental sharing of resources and expertise. Ensure that quality obstetric care is a priority that guides individual and team decisions. Identify and communicate safety concerns, and work together to mitigate potential safety risks. Disseminate and use the best available evidence, includ- ing individual and hospital-level data, to guide practicepatterns. The joint call to action underscores the collective belief among health care providers that ongoing collaboration isa key element to improving health care outcomes. By pro-viding interprofessional collaboration and care manage-ment for families in labor, the overall experience can pro-mote optimal patient care, satisfaction, and maternal andfetal outcomes (AWHONN, 2011).QSEN3704_Ch08_185-232 03/10/13 2:49 PM Page 207Active Phase The active phase (dilation to 7 cm) of labor averages 3-6 hours in length. It is typically shorter for multigravidas (Table 8-1).Women in this phase may have decreased energy and expe-rience fatigue. They become more serious and turn attentionUNIT 3 The Intrapartal Period 208 Figure 8-25 Leopold's maneuver.BOX 8-3 LEOPOLD'S MANEUVERS The purpose of Leopold's maneuvers is to inspect and palpatethe maternal abdomen to determine fetal position, station, andsize (Fig. 8-25). The first maneuver is to determine what part of the fetus islocated in the fundus of the uterus. The second maneuver is to determine location of the fetal back. The third maneuver is to determine the presenting part. The fourth maneuver is to determine the location of thecephalic prominence. Mattson & Smith (2004). AB CDBOX 8-2 STERILE VAGINAL EXAM Intrapartal Sterile Vaginal ExamTo perform a vaginal exam, the labia are separated with a ster-ile gloved hand. Finger s ar e lubricated with a water-soluble lubricant. The first and second fingers are inserted into theintroitus; the cervix is located and the following parameters areassessed (Fig. 8-24): Cervical dilation: This measurement estimates the dilation ofthe cervical opening by sweeping the examining finger from themargin of the cervical opening on one side to that on the other. Cervical effacement: This measurement estimates the shorten-ing of the cervix from 2 cm to paper thin measured by palpa-tion of cervical length with the fingertips. The degree of cervicaleffacement is expressed in terms of the length of the cervicalcanal compared to that of an unaffected cervix. When it isreduced by one-half (1 cm), it is 50% effaced. When the cervixis thinned out completely, it is 100% effaced. Position of cervix: Relationship of the cervical os to thefetal head and is characterized as posterior, midposition,or anterior. Station: Level of the presenting part in the birth canal in rela-tionship to the ischial spines. Station is 0 when the presentingpart is at the ischial spines or engaged in the pelvis. Presentation: Cephalic (head first), breech (pelvis first),shoulder (shoulder first) Fetal position: Locate presenting part and specific fetalstructure to determine fetal position in relation to the maternal pelvis.BOX 8-4 STANDARD OF PRACTICE. AWHONN PRACTICE STATEMENT: PROFESSIONALNURSING SUPPORT LABORINGWOMEN Association for Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses(AWHONN) maintains that continuously available labor sup-port by a professional registered nurse is a critical component toachieve improved birth outcomes. AWHONN views labor careand labor support as powerful nursing functions, and believes itis incumbent on health care facilities to provide an environmentthat encourages the unique patient-nurse relationship duringchildbirth. Only the registered nurse combines adequate formalnursing education and clinical patient management skills withexperience in providing physical, psychological, and sociocultu-ral care to laboring women. The registered nurse facilitates thechildbirth process in collaboration with the laboring woman.The nurse's expertise and therapeutic presence influence patientand family satisfaction with the labor and delivery experience.Evidence supports women who are provided with continuouslyavailable support during labor experience improved labor anddelivery outcomes compared with those who labor without askilled support person. The support provided by the professionalregistered nurse should include: Assessment and management of the physiological and psychological processes of labor Provision of emotional support and physical comfort measures Evaluation of fetal well-being during labor Instruction regarding the labor process Patient advocacy and collaboration among members of thehealth care team Role modeling to facilitate family participation during laborand birth Direct collaboration with other members of the health careteam to coordinate patient care AWHONN (2000a). to internal sensations. As labor progresses, most women turninward. Characteristics of this phase are:The cervix dilates, on average, 0.5 cm/hr for primi-parous women and 1.5 cm/hr for multiparous women.Current evidence suggests that the slowest dilation ratefor primiparous women in early active labor is 0.5cm/hr.(Neal al., 2010).3704_Ch08_185-232 03/10/13 2:49 PM Page 208CHAPTER 8 Intrapartum Assessment and Interventions 209 Cervical dilation progresses from 4 cm-7 cm with effacement of 40%-80%. Fetal descent continues. Contractions become more intense, occurring every 2-5 minutes with duration of 45-60 seconds. Discomfort increases, and this is typically the time thewoman comes to the birth center or hospital if she hasnot done so already. Medical Interventions Rupture membranes if not previously ruptured if indicated. Evaluate fetal status by fetal monitoring as indicated,either intermittent or continuous. Perform internal monitoring with application of internalfetal electrode and/or uterine transducer, if necessary. Pain assessment: order pain medication or epiduralanesthesia. Evaluate progression in labor. Nursing Actions (see Clinical Pathway and Concept Map) Monitor FHR and contractions every 15-30 minutes. Monitor maternal vital signs every 2 hours; every 1 hourif ROM. Perform intrapartal vaginal exam as needed to assess cervical changes and fetal descent (Box 8-2). Assess pain (location and degree). Administer analgesia as per orders and desire of woman. Evaluate effectiveness of epidural or other pain medication. Monitor intake and output (I&O), hydration status, andfor nausea and vomiting. Offer oral fluids as per orders (ice chips, popsicles, car-bohydrate liquids, and water). Encourage the woman tolisten to her body in regard to hydration and nausea andallow her to decide when she has had enough intake. Offer clear explanations and updates of progress. Promote comfort measures (see Critical Component:Non-pharmacologic Strategies for Nurses and ComfortMeasures in Labor). Assist with elimination (bladder distension can hinderfetal descent). Encourage breathing and relaxation methods (see Box 8-4).Review and reinforce relaxation techniques. Maintain eye contact and physical proximity to the woman. Develop a rhythm and breathing style to deal with eachcontraction. Use a direct and gentle voice and have a calm and confi-dent manner. Use touch of massage if acceptable to the woman. Interdisciplinary collaboration management of laborassists in communicating the woman's progress and statuswith other care providers. Incorporate the support person in care of patient by:Role modeling supportive behaviors Offering support and praise Assisting partner with food and rest Providing breaks if desired or neededExplain procedures before initiating, asking for permis-sion from the patient. Assess the environment for adjustments to be made; typi-cally decrease stimulation with dim lighting and decreasenoise and interruptions. Provide reassurance, updates on progress, and positivereinforcement. Transition Phase The transition phase (dilation to 10 cm), is usually the mostdifficult but shortest of the first stages of labor (Table 8-1). Intransition, women are easily discouraged and irritable, andmay be overwhelmed and panicky. They often feel and act outof control. Characteristics of this phase are:Cervical dilation from 8-10 cm with complete (100%)effacement Intense contractions every 1-2 minutes lasting 60-90 seconds Exhaustion and increased difficulty concentrating Increase of bloody show Nausea and vomiting Backache: woman complains of back pressure, hand goesover hip, rubbing and pressing on area. Trembling Diaphoresis: especially upper lip and facial area Strong urge to bear down or push, more vocal with primalnoises and facial expressions. Medical Interventions Perform amniotomy (AROM) if not previously done. Assess fetal position and cervix. Prepare for delivery Nursing Actions (see Clinical Pathway and concept Map) Assess FHR and UCs every 15 minutes. Provide calming support and reassurance, speaking slowlyin low, soothing tone, giving short and clear directs suchas: \"You are in control;\" \"It is normal to feel so muchpressure as the baby moves down;\" \"You are doing a greatjob working with your contractions.\"Woman who are given encouragement and empowered tofollow their body will have less anxiety and fear of theprocess and will perform with more control and conviction. Encourage the woman to breathe during contractions andrest between contractions by staying with patient andbreathing with her (see Box 8-4). Assist with breathingand relaxation methods by demonstrating breathingthrough demonstration and reinforcement.Providing support and encouragement will assist indecreasing fear and anxiety. Assess I&O and assist with toileting as needed.Bladder distension may hinder fetal descent, cause bladdertrauma and discomfort. Promote comfort measures (see Critical Component:Non-pharmacologic Strategies for Nurses and ComfortMeasures in Labor).3704_Ch08_185-232 03/10/13 2:49 PM Page 209UNIT 3 The Intrapartal Period 210 Attend to the hygiene needs of the woman, such asmopping her brow and face, providing pericare, andchanging chux.Providing comfort and hygiene measures shows attentionto and respect for the patient's personal needs. Prepare the room and couple for delivery.Familiarize the woman and support people with usualroutine and keep them informed of what to expect. Open the delivery tray. Turn on the infant radiant warmer. Use brief explanations, as the woman's focus is narrowed. Remain in the room with the woman and family. Provide encouragement and reassurance to the womanand her support person(s).Keep them apprised of labor progress, such as changes incervical dilation. Compliment them on their effective breathing and relax-ation techniques. Second Stage The woman enters the second stage of labor when cervical dilation is complete (10 cm) (see Table 8-1). This stage endswith the birth of the baby (Fig. 8-26). Women in the secondstage may have a burst of energy, be more focused, and mayfeel like they are able to actively participate in facilitating birthwith active pushing efforts. Characteristics of this stage are:Typically lasts 50 minutes for primigravidas and 20 minutesfor multigravidas, although a second stage of several hoursis normal. Woman may feel an intense urge to push or bear downwhen the baby reaches the pelvic floor.Studies have shown that bearing down in the second stageis less tiring and more effective when begun after thewoman has the urge to do so instead of beginning to pushwithout an urge to (Roberts, 2002, 2003). In nulliparouswomen with epidurals, there was a 27% less pushing timefor those who delayed their efforts until they felt the urge topush (Ferguson's reflex), which decreased maternal fatigue,provided increased maternal satisfaction in the birth experience, and allowed women to fully participate inpostpartum activities (Gillesby et al., 2010). Contractions are intense, occurring every 2 minutes andlasting 60-90 seconds in duration. Bloody show increases. The perineum flattens and the rectum and vagina bulge. Labor Position and Bearing Down Variation in practice exists in positioning of women duringthe second stage of labor. Many women maintain a semi-recumbent position, but there are benefits to a more uprightposition. Along with the timing of the bearing-down efforts,which include the spontaneous versus the directed pushing,the way a woman pushes has also been studied. Two typeshave been studied for the effects on the fetus: the closed-glottis (Valsalva maneuver) and the open-glottis pushing (seeEvidence-Based Practice: Guideline of Nursing Managementof Second Stage of Labor). The results are that fetal hypoxiaand acidosis have been associated with the prolonged breathholding (closed glottis) and forceful pushing efforts. No sig-nificant differences have been found in the duration of thesecond stage of labor with the timing and how a womanpushes (Mayberry et al., 2000). Evidence-Based Practice: AWHONN Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guideline: NursingManagement of Second Stage of Labor Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and NeonatalNurses (AWHONN) clinical practice recommendations formanagement of pushing include: Assess the woman's knowledge of pushing techniques,expectations for pushing, presence of Ferguson's reflex (urgeto bear down), and readiness to push as well as the fetalpresentation, position, and station. Encourage open glottis pushing for 4-6 seconds followed bya slight exhale, repeating this pattern for five or six pushes percontraction. Open glottis refers to spontaneous, involuntarybearing down accompanying the forces of the uterine con-traction and is usually characterized by expiratory grunting orvocalizations. This spontaneous method usually involves fiveor six pushes of 4-6 seconds' duration with each contraction. Whenever possible, discourage the traditional practice ofbreath holding for 10 seconds with each contraction. Closedglottis pushing, also referred to as the Valsalva technique,involves a voluntary or directed strenuous bearing-downeffort against a closed glottis for at least 10 seconds. Thismethod usually involves two to three pushes of 10 secondseach during a contraction. Provide birthing aids such as birthing balls, squat bars, birthingstools, and cushions to support the woman and the pelvis. Evaluate the effectiveness of pushing efforts and descent ofthe presenting part. Support and facilitate the woman's spontaneous pushingefforts. Evaluate the effectiveness of upright or other positions onfetal descent, rotation, and maternal-fetal condition. Upright positioning for the second stage of labor refers tothe patient's position sitting with the head of the bed at a 45-degree angle or greater, squatting, kneeling, or standingduring the second stage of labor. Benefits of upright posi-tioning include: pelvic diameter may be increased by 30%,shortened duration of second stage, pain may be decreased,and perineal trauma may be decreased. Ferguson's reflex is a physiological response of the woman,activated when the presenting part of the fetus is at least at+1 station; it is usually accompanied by spontaneous bear-ing-down efforts. Pushing efforts may be delayed until theFerguson reflex is present. Delayed pushing is waiting for fetal descent and or initiationof Ferguson's reflex before pushing begins in the secondstage of labor. Delayed pushing is also referred to as \"labor-ing down,\" \"passive pushing,\" and \"rest and descend.\" Delayed pushing may also be appropriate for women withepidural anesthesia/analgesia who do not feel the urge to push.

Provide reassurance to the woman while she pushes andbrings baby down through the birth canal. Perform episiotomy if necessary (Box 8-5). Assist the woman in the birthing of her child. Nursing Actions (see Clinical Pathway) Instruct the woman to bear down with the urge to push(see Evidence-Based Practice guideline).More progress is made and fewer traumas are noted to mother and fetus with spontaneous pushing efforts.

Advocate on the woman's behalf for her desires of thedelivery plan. Assist the support person and partner.Role model supportive behaviors. Offer support, praise, and encouragement. Assist with food and rest and provide breaks. Third Stage The third stage of labor begins immediately after the deliv- ery of the fetus and involves separation and expulsion of theplacenta and membranes (see Table 8-1). As the infant isborn, the uterus spontaneously contracts around its dimin-ishing contents. This sudden decrease in uterine size isaccompanied by a decrease in the area of placental implan-tation. This results in the decidual layer separating from theuterine wall. Placental separation typically occurs within afew minutes after delivery. Once the placenta separates fromthe wall of the uterus, the uterus continues to contract untilthe placenta is expelled (Fig. 8-29). This process typicallytakes 5-30 minutes post-delivery of the Perine al bodyBOX 8-5 EPISIOTOMY AND LACERATIONS Episiotomy is an incision in the perineum to provide more space for the presenting part at delivery (see Fig. 8-27 ). Routine use of episiotomy at delivery is no longer typical. A median or midline episiotomy is at the midline and tends to heal more quickly with less discomfort. A medilateral episiotomy is cut at a 45-degree angle to the left or right and may be used for a large infant. It tends to healmore slowly, causes greater blood loss, and is more painful. Lacerations are tears in the perineum that may occur at delivery (see Fig. 8-28 ): Lacerations can occur in the cervix, vagina, and/or the per- ineum (Fig. 8-28A). A A third-degree laceration involves skin, mucous membrane, and muscle of the perineal body and extends to the rectalsphincter (Fig. 8-28D). A fourth-degree laceration extends into the rectal mucosa and exposes the lumen of the rectum (Fig. 8-28E). Figure 8-27 Episiotomy locations. spontaneously. Signs that signify the impending delivery ofthe placenta include:Upward rising of the uterus into a ball shape Lengthening of the umbilical cord at the introitus Sudden gush of blood from the vagina Active management of placental delivery consists of theuse of uterotonics, controlled cord traction, and uterinemassage (Murray & Huelsmann, 2009).Normal blood loss for a vaginal birth is approximately 500 mL. The placenta, membranes, and cord are examined by the care provider for completeness and anomalies.Uterotonics may be administered after the delivery of the placenta. See Medication: Uterotonics.

During this stage,the nurse is caring for both the woman and her newborn child(see Table 8-1). This stage also begins the postpartum period(see Chapter 12 for a discussion of postpartum period). Medical Interventions Repair the episiotomy or laceration (see Box 8-5, Fig. 8-27, and Fig. 8-28). Inspect the placenta. Assess the fundus for firmness. Order uterotonics.

Assess pain and medicate as per orders. Stay with the mother and family. Offer congratulations and reassurance on a job well doneto the woman and family. Encourage mother-baby interaction by:Providing immediate newborn contact Assisting with early breastfeeding, if desired Pointing out the newborn's quiet, alert state Monitor newborn status, including temperature, heartand respiratory rates, skin color, adequacy of peripheralcirculation, type of respiration, level of consciousness, andtone and activity every 30 minutes. Provide an opportunity for the support person to interactwith newborn (Fig. 8-31). CRITICAL COMPONENT Newborn Family Attachment An important goal during the fourth stage is the newborn-familyattachment. This is promoted by allowing early contact with thenewborn and encouragement of eye contact and touch, and alsoby allowing time to hold the newborn. Positive maternal bondingbehaviors include making eye contact, touching and talking to thebaby, and other positive behaviors such as smiling and cuddlingthe newborn. This is often the best time to institute breastfeeding.The newborn may remain in the labor and delivery room with thefamily for all of the immediate recovery period. A B C Figure 8-29 A.

An Apgar score of:0-3 indicates severe distress4-6 indicates moderate difficulty with transition to extrauter- ine life 7-10 indicates stable status. The Apgar score is not used to determine the need for resuscitation, nor is it predictive of long-term neurologicaloutcome of the neonate (American Academy of Pediatrics[AAP] and American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology[ACOG], 2006). Rather it is a rapid, objective, convenientshorthand for reporting the status of the newborn and theresponse to resuscitation immediately after birth. At every delivery, there should be one person who is solely responsible for assessment of the neonate response tothe birth and who has the capacity to initiate resuscitationof the neonate if needed. Only 1% of neonates need exten-sive resuscitation at birth (AAP & AHA, 2011). The initialsteps of resuscitation are to provide warmth by placing the baby under a radiant heat source, positioning the headin a \"sniffing\" position to open the airway, clearing the air-way if necessary with a bulb syringe or suction catheter,drying the baby, and stimulating breathing. Further discus-sion of neonatal resuscitation is beyond the scope of thisbook except to mention optimal management of oxygenduring neonatal resuscitation becomes particularly impor-tant because of the evidence that either insufficient orexcessive oxygenation can be harmful to the newborninfant. More recent guidelines recommend use of a pulseoximeter to provide a continuous assessment of the pulsewithout interruption of other resuscitation measures. Oncepositive pressure ventilation or supplementary oxygenadministration is begun, assessment should consist ofsimultaneous evaluation of three vital characteristics: heartrate, respirations, and the state of oxygenation, the latteroptimally determined by a pulse oximeter. The most sensi-tive indicator of a successful response to each step is anincrease in heart rate (Kattwinkel, Perlman, Aziz, Colby,Fairchild, neonatal resuscitation is in 8-32.

Initial assessments can be safely done withthe infant skin-to-skin on the mother's abdomen after deliv-ery, if the infant is stable. Apgar scores should be obtained at1 minute and 5 minutes after birth. If the 5-minute Apgarscore is less than 7, additional scores should be assigned every5 minutes up to 20 minutes. Temperature, heart and respira-tory rates, skin color, adequacy of peripheral circulation, typeof respiration, level of consciousness, tone, and activity shouldbe monitored and recorded at least every 30 minutes until thenewborn's condition has remained stable for at least 2 hours. The Apgar score is a rapid assessment of five physiological signs that indicate the physiological status of the newborn andincludes (Table 8-2):Heart rate based on auscultation Respiratory rate based on observed movement of chest Muscle tone based on degree of flexion and movement ofextremities Reflex irritability based on response to tactile stimulation Color 03/10/13 2:49 neonatal resuscitation flow diagram:Newly born infants who do not require resuscitation can generally be identified by a rapid assessment of the following 3 characteristics: Term gestation?Crying or breathing?Good muscle tone?If the answer to all 3 of these questions is \"yes,\" the baby does not need resuscitation and should not be separated from the mother. The baby should be dried, placed skin-to-skin with the mother, and covered with dry linen to maintain temperature.Observation of breathing, activity, and color should be ongoing. The initial steps of resuscitation are to provide warmth by placing the baby under a radiant heat source, positioning the head in a \"sniffing\" position to open the airway, clearing the airway if necessary with a bulb syringe or suction catheter, dry ing the baby, and stimulating breathing.

Childbirth preparation may decrease anxiety anddecrease pain. The woman's expectations influence her satisfaction withher birth experience (Evidence-Based Practice: MaternalSatisfaction).Pain in childbirth is transmitted from the periphery of the body along nerve pathways to the brain. This pain isattributable to:Uterine contractions resulting in uterine pain from adecrease in blood supply to the uterus Increased pressure and stretching of the pelvic structuresresulting in the pulling and expansion of ligaments, muscle,and peritoneum Cervical dilation and stretching resulting in the stimulationof the nerve ganglia.A comprehensive discussion of the newborn's transition toextrauterine life, physical assessment, and routine proce-dures are presented in Chapter 15. One of the first procedures after birth is newborn identifica- tion. Perinatal nurses must be meticulous when recording theidentification band number, and birth and newborn information,and applying identification bands to mothers and newborns.Institutional policies for newborn identification and newbornsafety may vary. Routinely three medications are administered to newborns: Erythromycin ointment is administered to the eyes asprophylaxis to prevent gonococcal and Chlamydiainfections. Vitamin K is administered via intramuscular injection to prevent hemorrhagic disease caused by vitamin Kdeficiency. Hepatitis B virus vaccine is recommended for all new-borns (American Academy of Pediatrics Committee onInfected Diseases, 2009).Newborn care is discussed in Chapter 15. MANAGEMENT OF PAIN AND DISCOMFORT DURING LABOR AND DELIVERY Pain in childbirth is a universal experience and considered anormal occurrence. Most pain in labor results from normalphysiologic events (Burke 2014). Pain associated with laborhas been described as one of the most intensely painful expe-riences possible. Labor pain differs from other conditions inwhich pain is experienced in several ways. Understanding the cause and characteristics of pain in the labor and delivery setting helps the nurse develop a planof care for the woman in each stage of the labor process.Labor pain is acute pain and presents in many ways. Duringthe first stages of labor pain is caused by uterine musclehypoxia, accumulation of lactic acid in the muscles, loweruterine and cervical stretching, traction on pelvic organs,and pressure on the bony pelvis. During the second stage,pain is due to pelvic muscle distention and pressure on theperineum, cervix, urethra, and rectum. Back pain duringlabor is thought to be caused by pressure of the fetal occiputon the maternal spine and pelvis. Factors influencing pain response include both the physi- cal and psychosocial:Rate of cervical dilation and strength of contractions Size and position of fetus impacts length of labor. Sleep deprivation and exhaustion from long labor increasespain perception. Culture of the woman influences her response to laborand pain. Pain behaviors are culturally bound (seeCultural Awareness: Culture and Birth Traditions). The woman's labor support system can affect her anxietylevel and perception of pain.Evidence-Based Practice: Maternal Satisfaction Florence, D., & Palmer, D. (2003). Therapeutic choices for the discomforts oflabor. Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing, 17(4), 238. Hodnett, E. (2002). Pain and women's satisfaction with the experience of child-birth: A systematic review. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 186 (5), S160-S172. Research has shown that maternal satisfaction post-birth is influenced by the degree of pain endured but is far more influenced by whether the actual birth event met the woman's personal expectations (Hodnett, 2002).Satisfaction with the labor experience is based on variablesthat include cultural influence, previous experiences, commu-nication from family and providers, and prenatal education(Florence & Palmer, 2003). Gate Control Theory of Pain The use of the gate control theory of pain can be applied tothe process of labor and birth (Fig. 8-33). This theory statesthat sensation of pain is transmitted from the periphery ofthe body along ascending nerve pathways to the brain.Because of the limited number of sensations that can travelalong these pathways at any given time, an alternate activitycan replace travel of the pain sensation, thus closing the gatecontrol at the spinal cord and reducing pain impulses travel-ing to the brain. Based on this premise, the application ofpressure to certain areas of the body, the cutaneous stimula-tion such as effleurage (gentle stroking of the abdomen), orthe use of heat or cold can have a direct effect on closing thegate, which then limits the transmission of pain. A similargating mechanism can be found in the descending nervefibers from the hypothalamus and cerebral cortex. Strategiessuch as breathing, focusing, and visual and auditory stimu-lation may affect whether pain impulses reach the level ofconscious awareness.3704_Ch08_185-232 03/10/13 2:49 PM Page 218CHAPTER 8 Intrapartum Assessment and Interventions 219 Non-pharmacological Management of Labor Discomfort Non-pharmacological management of labor discomfort includespreparation by the woman for childbirth, cutaneous stimulation,thermal stimulation, mental stimulation, and the presence of asupport person(s). It is essential that nurses have a repertoire ofstrategies to manage discomfort and pain during labor (seeCritical Component: Non-pharmacologic Strategies for Nursesand Comfort Measures in Labor). A willingness to try a varietyof strategies, adapt those that are effective, and modify and aban-don those that are not effective are important aspects of care.Usually no one strategy works for very long in labor, making flex-ibility and adaptability key qualities for labor nurses.Childbirth preparation methods: Education and explanationof birth process is offered through classes to the woman andher support person before the delivery time. In these classes,the woman and her partner learn about pregnancy, the laborprocess, the painful aspects of labor, and methods to helprelieve the discomforts of pregnancy and childbirth. Relaxation and breathing techniques: Varied breathingpatterns that promote relaxation and avoidance of pushingbefore complete cervical dilation. Most childbirth prepara-tion methods teach some form of relaxation and breathingtechniques (Fig. 8-34). Most women are taught to take adeep breath at the beginning of the contraction to signalthe onset of the contraction and then to breathe slowlyduring the contraction. As labor pain increases, the womanmay need to breathe in a more rapid and shallow manner.On occasion, a woman will experience hyperventilationfrom this type of breathing. Symptoms are related to respiratory alkalosis and include tingling of the fingers orcircumoral numbness, light-headedness, or dizziness. This undesirable side effect can be eliminated by havingthe woman breathe into a bag or cupped hands. This causes her to rebreathe carbon dioxide and reverses the res-piratory alkalosis. Discuss with the woman and her supportteam how they plan on managing labor. This will stimulateconversation, facilitate a plan of care to assist them in painmanagement, and give an opportunity to teach and or support them as needed. Effleurage is cutaneous stimulation done by lightly stroking the abdomen in rhythm with breathing during contractions.Another form of cutaneous stimulation is back massageand/or counter pressure to the sacral area by another.Strong signalsent to thalam us nervous system Central nervous system ++ +-- - - Figure 8-33 Gate control theory of pain modula- tion.

Thisincreased internal pressure by the fetal head is often associ-ated with the posterior position of the fetus during labor.As labor advances, women may not want to be touched. Thermal stimulation: Application of warmth or cold,such as use of warm showers or ice packs. The use ofhydrotherapy via whirlpools, warm baths, or showers isvery effective and promotes relaxation and comfort. Thismay reduce the woman's anxiety and promote well-being,causing a reduction in catecholamine production, whichinterferes with uterine contractility. Application of coldmay release musculoskeletal pain, and the numbing effectof cold may decrease the sensation of pain. Mental stimulation: Focal points, imagery, and musichelp the woman to concentrate on something outside herbody. This helps her to focus away from the pain. Withimagery, the woman is encouraged to bring into her minda picture of a relaxing scene. Support person(s): Significant other(s) and/or a doula provide emotional support and physical comfort and aidsin a beneficial form of care. Research has shown that support early in labor significantly relieves pain, improvesoutcomes, decreases interventions and complication rates,and thus enhances overall maternal satisfaction (Simkin &O'Hara, 2002). A doula can also be used as a support forwomen during pregnancy through postpartum. Doulas areunique in that they are trained to provide support, promotecomfort, and instill confidence to the laboring woman.Doulas are trained through many organizations and arepaid by the family that hires them. Doulas do not performclinical tasks and do not have direct communicationresponsibility to care providers (Burke, 2014). Some stud-ies have shown that women who used a doula had shorterlabors, less use of analgesia, fewer instrument deliveries,and decreased C-sections (Hodnett et al., 2003). Complementary Therapy Many therapies have been used to promote relaxation anddecrease the perception of pain while providing a complementto decrease the use of pharmacological interventions(Zwelling, Johnson, & Allen, 2006).Aromatherapy: Use of essential oils: can be inhaled (suchas by vaporizers) or used in a carrier oil or lotion to beused with massage to promote relaxation and decrease theperception of pain. A few drops placed in a bath can bean adjunct to hydrotherapy. Lavender and jasmine oilspromote relaxation and decrease pain perception, whilepeppermint may decrease feelings of nausea. Massage: Multiple studies have shown massage to decreasepain and promote relaxation, which in turn promotes laborprogress. A quiet, soothing voice along with encouragingthe woman to image a safe place assists in relaxation. Thisused in conjunction with aromatherapy has proven toenhance relaxation in laboring women, allowing for thewomen to have better control of their labor.Birthing ball: This ball (65-cm) came out of physicaltherapy programs but has been used successfully in thelabor suite. It facilitates an upright position, opens thepelvis, and allows the woman to roll or bounce as shedeems necessary to manage her contractions and pain. Hydrotherapy: The use of water has been used in manyareas of medicine for many years to promote relaxationand pain control. The use of a shower or large tub is idealfor releasing endorphins, decreasing muscle tension, andpromoting circulation. The use of hydrotherapy with rup-tured membranes (ROM) has shown no increase ofinfections. The many benefits of hydrotherapy include:less medication needs, less anesthesia, faster labors, facili-tation of fetal positions (which decreases the number ofinstrumental deliveries), fewer episiotomies, decrease inblood pressure and edema, diuresis andincreased satisfaction in the birthing experience. Music therapy: Music calms the spirit, and decreasesstress and distress by diverting attention from the painreceptors and promoting relaxation.All of these complementary therapies are being used in some form today either alone or in conjunction with eachother, in all birthing venues, from home births to stand-alonebirth centers to hospital suites. They can assist the womanand her support team by providing comfort, empowering thebirth experience as the woman sees it, and promoting a safenon-invasive birth. Most classes teach a variety of strategies to manage labor pain. Specific methods include:Dick-Read method: Advocates birth without fear by edu-cation and environmental control and relaxation. Lamaze: Promotes psychoprophylaxis with conditioningand breathing. Bradley: This is husband-coached childbirth and supportby working with and managing the pain rather thanbeing distracted from it. Pharmacological Management of Labor Discomfort Pharmacological management of discomfort and pain in laborrequires the nurse to assess the woman's preferences for painmanagement throughout labor. The decision to use painmedication in labor should be made by the woman in collab-oration with her physician or midwife. The unique circum-stances of every labor influence the experience and perceptionof pain (Burke, 2014).Assessment of pain is an essential part of nursing care.Assessment of labor pain should include intensity, loca-tion, pattern, and degree of distress for the woman,aswell as using pain scale with numerical self report usinga scale of 1-10. The use of medication in the relief of pain during laborfalls into two major categories:Analgesia (Table 8-3) Anesthesia (Table 8-4) established.3704_Ch08_185-232 03/10/13 2:49 PM Page 220CHAPTER 8 Intrapartum Assessment and Interventions 221 TABLE 8-3 ANALGESIC MEDICATIONS IN LABOR MEDICATION CLASS SIDE EFFECTS NURSE INTERVENTION Meperidine (Demerol)50-100 mg IM25-50 mg IVMorp Sublimaze (Fentanyl)50-100 mg IM25-50 mg IMMay be used in conjunction with regional anesthesia Faucher & Brucker (2000); Florence & Palmer (2003); Spratto & Woods (2006); Burke (2013).Avoid use when close to delivery time (about 1 hour).

Used mainly in emergency cesarean birth Medication should provide relief to the woman with mini-mal risk to the baby. Neonatal depression may occur if medication is givenwithin an hour befo re delivery. Women with a history of drug abuse may have a lessenedeff ect from pain medication and require higher doses. Basic principles for anesthesia include:Local anesthesia is used at the time of delivery for episioto-my and repair. Regional anesthesia is used during labor and at delivery. Regional anesthesia includes the pudendal block,epidura l block, and spinal block.Regional or general anesthesia is used for cesarean deliveries. (Chapter 11 addresses care of cesarean birthwomen.) Parenteral Opioids The use of opioids in labor is common. Advantages includeavailability, ease of administration, and cost. Depending onthe dose, route of administration, and stage of labor parenteralanalgesia does not illuminate pain but causes a blunting effect,leading to a decrease in sensation of pain and inducing som-nolence (Burke 2013). Opioids cross the placenta Assessment and Interventions 223 Nitrous Oxide Analgesia A new interest in self-administered nitrous oxide for laboranalgesia has emerged in recent years in the United States. Ithas been used widely in Europe for decades, with favorableresults (Stewart & Collins, 2012). A recent published reviewconcludes nitrous oxide analgesia is safe for mothers,neonates, and those who care for women during childbirth(Rooks, 2011). In the context of obstetric analgesia, \"nitrousoxide\" usually refers to a half-and-half combination of oxygenand nitrous oxide gas, called by the trade name \"Nitronox.\" Itis self-administered by the laboring woman using a mouthtube or face mask, when she determines that she needs it,about a minute before she anticipates the onset of a strongcontraction until the pain eases. Its use can be started andstopped at any point during labor, according to the needs andpreferences of the woman. It takes effect in about 50 secondsafter the first breath and the effect is transient\u2014essentiallygone when no longer needed. It is simple to administer anddoes not interfere with the release and function of endoge-nous oxytocin, and has no adverse effects on the normal phys-iology and progress of labor. This analgesia may be of help for women who want to have an unmedicated birth but may needhelp at some point during labor and want whatever methodthey use to be under their control (Rooks, 2007). Epidural Anesthesia Epidural anesthesia is one of the most common forms of pain relief during labor used in the United States. In a recent report61 % of women who had a singleton birth in a vaginal deliveryin 2008 received epidural or spinal anesthesia (Osterman &Martin, 2011). Epidural anesthesia involves the placement ofa very small catheter and injection of local anesthesia and oranalgesia between the fourth and fifth vertebrae into theepidural space. A combined spinal epidural analgesia (CSE)involves the injection of local anesthetic and/or analgesic intothe subarachnoid space. Some patients may be able to ambu-late with this type of anesthesia; hence it is referred to as a\"walking epidural.\" Because of the widespread use of epiduralanesthesia in labor, AWHONN has generated evidence-basedpractice guidelines for care of pregnant women receivingregional anesthesia/analgesia (AWHONN, 2011).Three of every five women undergoing labor in theUnited States use this method each year and the rate ofepidural use in labor appears to be increaeseing (Osterman& Martin, 2011). Some research shows that epidural anal-gesia is associated with a lower rate of spontaneous vaginaldelivery, a higher rate of instrumental (e.g., vacuum suc-tion and/or forceps) vaginal delivery, longer labors, andincreased incidence of intrapartum fevers and/or suspectedsepsis (Buckley, 2005; Osterman & Martin, 2011). Areview of the evidence has concluded that research aboutthe effects of regional anesthesia/analgesia on the progressof labor may not be significant (AWHONN, 2011). Elevations in maternal temperature associated withregional anesthesia have been reported, but it is unclearwhether they are a response to infection versus a responseto sympathetic blockade. They may be associated withdecreased maternal hyperventilation, reduced perspira-tion, and altered thermoregulatory transmission. A wide variety of medications and dosing regimens areused for regional analgesia/anesthesia. Nurses are respon-sible for knowing general information about classificationof these medications, their actions, potential side effects,and complications (AWHONN, 2011). CRITICAL COMPONENT Epidural Anesthesia Nurses monitor, but not manage, the care of women receiv-ing epidural anesthesia. Catheter dosing of intermittent and continuous infusion ofregional analgesia/anesthesia is outside the scope of regis-tered nursing. Only qualied, licensed anesthesia providers should performinsertion, injection, and/or manage rate changes of a contin-uous infusion (AWHONN, 2011). Responsibilities of nurses caring for women receiving region-al anesthesia/analgesia are assessment, monitoring, andinterventions to minimize complications. After the stabilization of the patient after regional anesthesia,the nurse monitors the woman's vital signs, mobility, level ofconsciousness, and perception of pain, as well as fetal status. Nursing Actions Before the Epidural Nursing actions are based on AWHONN guidelines (2011):Assess woman's level of pain. Determine the woman's and her family's knowledge andconcerns about epidural anesthesia. Provide information about options for anesthesia/analgesia. Notify obstetrical and anesthesia care providers when thewoman requests epidural anesthesia. Assess and document baseline blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and temperature. Assess FHR to confirm a normal FHR pattern; if indeter-minate or abnormal, report to the physician or midwife. Encourage the patient to void before initiation of epidural anesthesia. If ordered, administer an IV bolus as ordered to decreaseincidence of hypotension. Obtain platelet count, blood type, and screen. Conduct a pre-procedure verification process per facilitypolicy. Conduct time out. Nursing Actions During Administration of EpiduralAnesthesia Assist the anesthesia provider, anesthesiologist, or nurseanesthetist (CRNA) with placement of the epidural,including placement of patient in the lateral position withhead flexed toward chest, or sitting position with head3704_Ch08_185-232 03/10/13 2:49 PM Page 223UNIT 3 The Intrapartal Period 224 flexed on chest, elbows on knees and feet supported onstool (AWHONN, 2011) (Fig. 8-35 and Fig. 8-36). Nursing Actions After Epidural Administration(AWHONN, 2011) Monitor vital signs according to agency protocols gen-erally every 5-15 minutes. Assess for hypotension andrespiratory distress.Up to 40% of women may experience hypotension.Difficulty breathing may indicate the catheter is in thesubarachnoid space. Hypotension is defined as systolic blood pressure less than100 mm Hg or a 20% decrease in blood pressure from pre-anesthesia levels. Notify the anesthesia provider if thepatient becomes hypotensive. Assess FHR every 5-15 minutes Facilitate lateral or upright positioning with uterine displacement.Helps to avoid supine hypotension. Assess for effectiveness of the epidural and the woman'spain levels and description of pain (see CriticalComponent: Epidural Anesthesia).Notify the anesthesia provider of inadequate pain relief. Assess for sedation if opioid medication is administeredwith local anesthesia.Drowsiness can occur in up to 50% of women who receivecombination local/opioid analgesia. Assess the level of motor blockade according to agencycriteria.If the patient receives an epidural that allows ambulation:Before ambulation, the nurse assesses somatosensory status,motor and ability to ambulate. Monitor for pruritis.Up to 90% of women who receive opioids in epiduralshave itching. Medicate as indicated. Monitor for nausea and vomiting.Up to 50% of women experience this and may be treatedwith antiemetics. Assess for post-procedural headache.Occurs in up to 3% of women related to leakage of spinalfluid with inadvertent puncture. If this occurs, it should bereported to the anesthesia provider. Assess the woman for urinary retention.This occurs in some women who receive epidural anesthesiabecause of decreased motor function. Catheterization istypically necessary. Assess the partner's or support person's response toepidural pain relief and answer questions (see Evidence-Based Practice: Expectant Fathers and Labor Epidurals). Monitor uterine contractions as uterine activity may slowfor up to 60 minutes after epidural placement. This maybe a side effect of the neuroaxial block and usually notreatment is needed. Some providers will initiate oxytocinaugmentation to stimulate contractions. Monitor for signs and symptoms of intravascular injectionincluding: This normally occurs during placement and ismonitored by a test dose being given by the anesthesiologist.Maternal tachycardia or bradycardia Hypertension Dizziness Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) Metallic taste in the mouth Loss of consciousness If intravascular injection occurs, the anesthesia care provider should be immediately notified and care includesadministering oxygen, fluids, and medication as ordered.Initiating CPR may be necessary.A higher level of anesthesia is necessary for a cesareanbirth than for labor (Fig. 8-37). Evidence-Based Practice: Expectant Fathers andLabor Epidurals Chapman, L. (2000). Expectant fathers and labor epidurals. Maternal Child Nursing, 25, 133-138. A qualitative research study using grounded theory methodolo-gy was conducted with the aim to describe and explain theexpectant father's experience during labor and birth whenepidural anesthesia/analgesia is used for labor pain manage-ment. Based on the research data a theory, \"cruising throughlabor,\" was developed. The epidural labor process is differentfrom nonepidural labor and is comprised of six phases: Holding out Surrendering Waiting Getting Cruising Pushing Expectant fathers explained that before the epidural they felt like they were \"losing\" their partner as the increasing paincaused the woman to focus inward and away from interactionwith those in the labor room. The expectant fathers explainedthat they felt a loss of connection with their partner and a lossof control. They felt that the pain of labor overtook their part-ner and was all-encompassing. The men further explained thatthey felt helpless, frustrated, and a sense of losing her to thepain of labor. The men explained that the labor nurse played a significant role in supporting them during this time. The major supportivebehaviors by the nurse were: Remaining in the labor room Explaining what was happening to their partner Including the men in the care of their partner Expectant fathers reported that once the epidural was administered and the woman experienced relief from laborpain, they saw a dramatic change in their partner's behavior.They often stated, \"She's back,\" that she was comfortableand able to interact with those around her. One man stated,\"She wasn't in pain. Her color was back. Her pain was gone. She wasn't throwing up. She was back. She was comfortable.\" Men further explained that the effects of the epidural in decreasing the degree of labor pain allowed the men to shifttheir focus from labor pain management to enjoying the laborand birthing experience ( Fig. PM 224CHAPTER 8 Intrapartum Assessment and Interventions 225 Figure 8-35 Lateral (A) and sitting (B) positions for placement of spinal and epidural block.

She arrived in the triage unit at midnight in early labor. She presented with uterine contractions that were 5 minutes apart for 3 hours. Patient is a 28-year-old G3 P1Hispanic woman. She is 39 weeks' gestation. Jos\u00e9, her husband,has accompanied her to the unit. Two years ago, she had a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery NSVD after an 18-hourlabor for a baby girl, Sonya, that was 7 lbs., 3 oz. Margarite's cervix is now 4 cm/80%/0 station and fetal position is left rate 18; temperature 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C). Began prenatal care at 10 weeks of gestation and received regular prenatal care. She gained 22 pounds during pregnancy,and her current weight is 164 lbs. She is 5 feet, 4 inches tall. Shehas no prior medical complications and has experienced a normal pregnancy. Her first pregnancy ended in miscarriage at 8 weeks' gestation. She has no allergies to food or medication.She does not have a birth plan and states, \"I just hope for a normal delivery and a healthy baby.\"Detail the aspects of your initial assessment. EFM reveals a FHR pattern that is normal, category I, with a FHR baseline of 140s moderate variability with accelerations to160s ( 20 seconds. She is uncomfortable with contractions andrates her pain at 5. She requests ambulation, as she feels morecomfortable with walking. At 0120 she has SROM for a large amount of clear amniotic fluid. FHR is baseline 130s with moderate variability, and accel-erations and contractions are every 3 minutes and feel moderateto palpation. Her SVE reveals her cervix is 5 cm/90/0 station. Sheis very uncomfortable with contractions but does not want painmedication at this time. Jos\u00e9 appears anxious and at a loss forhow to help his wife.What are your immediate priorities in nursing care for Margarite and Jos\u00e9 Sanchez? Discuss the rationale for the priorities.What teaching would you include?State nursing diagnosis, expected outcome, and interventions related to managing her labor pain. What are appropriate interventions to manage her labor pain nonpharma- cologically? At 2 A.M. Margarite is increasingly uncomfortable with contrac- tions and cries out that she can no longer take the pain. Her cervi-cal exam is 6/100/0. She requests pain medication and is given adose of Nubain at 0215 for pain relief in active labor. Jos\u00e9 asks howmuch longer the labor will be and when the baby will be born.Detail the aspects of your ongoing assessment.What are your current priorities in nursing care for Margarite Sanchez?Discuss the rationale for the priorities.Further teaching would include the following:State nursing diagnosis, expected outcome, and interventions related to this problem. At 0410 Margarite is very uncomfortable with contractions and cries out that she feels more pressure. She vomits a smallamount of bile-colored fluid, and is perspiring and breathinghard with contractions. Her cervical exam is 8/90/0. Sherequests pain medication and is given a dose of Nubian at 0440for pain relief in transition.What are appropriate interventions? At 0630 Margarite reports an urge to bear down and push with contractions, is very uncomfortable with contractions, and criesout that she feels more pressure. Her sterile vaginal exam (SVE)reveals she is 10 cm/100% and +1 station. She has a strong urgeto push with contractions that are every 2 minutes and strong topalpation. The fetal heart rate is 130 with moderate variability,and the FHR drops to 90 bpm for 40 seconds with pushing efforts.What are your immediate priorities in nursing care for Margarite Sanchez?Discuss the rationale for the priorities.What does the FHR indicate?Teaching would include the following:State nursing diagnosis, expected outcome, and interventions related to managing her labor pain.

INTRODUCTION This chapter is an introduction to basic electronic fetal mon-itoring (EFM) concepts. Fetal heart rate (FHR) assessmentbegan almost 200 years ago when Europeans (Swiss surgeonMayor in 1818 and nobleman Kergaradec in 1821) (Freemanet al., 2003) reported the presence of fetal heart sounds viaauscultation (hearing sounds via ear-to-abdomen or stetho-scope). It continues to be the primary method for intrapartumfetal surveillance despite concerns regarding its efficacy andability to improve neonatal outcomes (Freeman, 2002;Tucker et al., 2009). The goal of fetal monitoring is the interpretation and ongoing assessment of fetal oxygenation (Feinstein, Torgersen,& Atterbury, 2003). EFM is a technique for fetal assessmentbased on the fact that the FHR reflects fetal oxygenation(Lyndon, O'Brien-Abel, & Simpson, 2014). Current practiceindicates that EFM is used for virtually all women during laborin the United States. EFM is essential in the assessment ofmaternal and fetal well-being in antepartal and intrapartal settings (Menihan & Kopel, 2008).Nurses are expected to independently assess, interpret, and intervene related to interpretations of EFM patterns.Assessments and interactions with monitored women andtheir families are individualized and geared to providinginformation and explanation, and reducing anxiety. Clear andaccurate communication with care providers and the perinatalteam is essential for optimizing perinatal care (see Qualityand Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) Teamwork andCollaboration). Assessment of FHR in the intrapartal periodis the focus of this chapter. TERMINOLOGY RELATED TO FETAL ASSESSMENT Definitions used in this chapter are from the National Instituteof Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).Research Planning Workshop (1997) and the 2008 NICHDWorkshop Report on Electronic Fetal Monitoring: Update on Definitions, Interpretations and Research Guidelines publications (Macones et al., 2008; ACOG Practice Bulletin,July 2010).There is a current movement to standardize language 233Don't have time to read this chapter?

It is critical for labor units to select one set of definitionsfor FHR patterns for all types of professional communications(Simpson, 2004a; AWHONN, 2009) (Table 9-1 and Box 9-1). Clinicians should be familiar with these definitions and use themconsistently in clinical practice. TABLE 9-1 TERMINOLOGY RELATED TO FETAL HEART RATE ASSESSMENT TERMINOLOGYBASELINE (2008).DEFINITIONMean fetal heart rate (FHR) rounded to increments of 5 beats per minute (bpm) during a 10-minute window , excluding accelerations and decelerations. Fluctuations in the baseline FHR that are irregular in amplitude and frequency. The fluctuations are visually quantified as the amplitude of the peak to trough in bpm. It is determined in a 10-minute window, excluding accelerations and decelerations. It reflects the interaction betweenthe fetal sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. \u0081Absent: Amplitude range is undetectable is visually undetectable 5 bpm \u0081Moderate: Amplitude from peak to trough 6 bpm to 25 bpm \u0081Marked: Amplitude range >25 bpm Visually apparent, abrupt increase in FHR above the baseline. The peak of the acceler ation is 15 bpm over the baseline FHR f or 15 seconds and >2 minutes. \u0081Before 32 weeks' gestation acceleration is 10 beats over the baseline FHR f or 10 seconds. Prolonged acceler ations are 2 minutes, but 10 minutes. Transitory decrease in the FHR from the baseline.\u0081Early deceleration is a visually apparent gr adual decrease in FHR below the baseline. The nadir (lowest point) of the deceler ation occurs at the same time as the peak of the UC. In most cases the onset, nadir, and recovery of the deceleration are coincident or mirror the contraction. \u0081Variable deceleration is a visually apparent abrupt decrease in the FHR below baseline; the decrease in the FHR is 15 bpm lasting 15 seconds and <2 minut es in dur ation. \u0081Late deceleration is a visually apparent gr adual decrease of FHR below the baseline. Nadir (lowest point) of the deceler ation occurs after the peak of the contraction. In most cases the onset, nadir, and recovery of the deceleration occurs after the respective onset, peak, and end of the UC. \u0081Prolonged deceleration is a visually apparent abrupt decrease in FHR below baseline that is 15 bpm lasting 2 minutes but 10 minutes. \u0081Sinusoidal pattern is defined as having a visually apparent smooth sine-like wave like undulating patt ern in FHR baseline with a cycle frequency of 3-5/min that persists for 20 minutes. Baseline FHR of >160 bpm lasting 10 minutes or longer.Baseline FHR of <110 bpm lasting for 10 minutes or longer.FHR pattern that reflects a favorable physiological response to the maternal fetal environment.FHR pattern that reflects an unfavorable physiological response to the maternal fetal environment.QSEN Teamwork and Collaboration The QSEN definition for teamwork and collaboration is tofunction effectively within nursing and inter-professionalteams, fostering open communication, mutual respect, andshared decision-making to achieve quality patient care.Communication and collaboration are particularly essentialrelated to EFM. Some suggestions to foster your developmentin this area related to EFM include: Follow communication practices that minimize risks asso- ciated with EFM communication among providers.Appreciate the importance of intra- and inter-professional collaboration to improve patient outcomes. Integrate the contributions of others who play a role in helping patient and family achieve a healthy birth. Respect the centrality of the patient/family as core mem- bers of any health care team. Acknowledge your own potential to contribute to effective team functioning in this critical setting.QSEN3704_Ch09_233-260 16/09/13 10:14 AM Page 234CHAPTER 9 Fetal Heart Rate Assessment 235 MODES OR TYPES OF FETAL AND UTERINE MONITORING Auscultation Auscultation is use of the fetoscope or Doppler to hear theFHR by externally listening without the use of a paperrecorder (Feinstein et al., 2008) (Fig. 9-1). Auscultationwith a fetoscope allows the practitioner to hear the soundsassociated with the opening and closing of ventricular valvesvia bone conduction. A Doppler, by contrast, uses ultra-sound technology, using sound waves deflected from fetalheart movements (similar to that used on an electronic fetalmonitor external ultrasound transducer). This ultrasounddevice then converts information into a sound that repre-sents cardiac events. Auscultation limits assessment data to FHR baseline, rhythm, and changes from baseline. Auscultation cannotdetect certain types of decelerations and variability, which areenabled only by a combination of a paper recorder and ultra-sound technology (part of electronic fetal monitoring). Research evidence supports the use of intermittent auscul- tation (IA) as a method of fetal surveillance during labor forlow-risk pregnancies (Lyndon & Ali, 2008; Feinstein,Sprague, & Trepanier, 2008). Box 9-2 provides the Clinical Position Statement of the Association of Women's Health,Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN) with regard tofetal heart monitoring. In summary, fetoscope and Dopplerobtain information differently but are both appropriate insome auscultation clinical situations. Palpation of Contractions When the uterus contracts, the musculature becomes firmand tense and can be palpated with the fingertips by thenurse. The frequency, duration, tone, and intensity of con-tractions can be assessed by palpation (AWHONN, 2009).This is a subjective assessment and can be biased by the fatdistribution around the pregnant woman's uterus.Palpation of uterine contractions is done by the nurseplacing her fingertips on the fundus of the uterus andassessing the degree of tension as the contractions occur.BOX 9-1 COMMON ABBREVIATIONS FOR ELECTRONIC FETAL MONITORING bpm beats per minute ED Early deceleration EFM Electronic fetal monitoring FHR Fetal heart rate FSE Fetal scalp electrode IA UC Uterine contractions US Ultrasound VD Variable deceleration VE Vaginal examination Figure 9-1 Auscultation of fetal heart rate.

BOX 9-2 AWHONN FETAL HEART MONITORING CLINICAL POSITION STATEMENT The professional organization for perinatal nursing states:\"AWHONN supports the assessment of the laboring woman andher fetus through the use of auscultation, palpation and/or elec-tronic monitoring techniques...to assess and promote maternaland well being.\" AWHONN \"does not support the use ofEFM as a substitute for appropriate professional nursing careand support of women in labor\" (AWHONN, 2008, p. 1). The policy statement recommends ongoing education in the interpretation of fetal assessment. The policy recommends that guidelines are developed in facilities specifying modes andfrequency of fetal assessment as well as policies that addresscommunication and collaboration essential to providing qualitycare and optimizing patient Source: AWHONN Intrapartal Period 236 The intensity of contractions is measured at the peak ofthe contraction and is rated as:Mild or 1+ feels like the tip of the nose (easily indented) Moderate or 2+ feels like the chin (can slightly indent) Strong or 3+ feels like the forehead (cannot indent uterus) The resting tone is measured between contractions andlisted as either soft or firm uterine tone. External Electronic Fetal and Uterine Monitoring External electronic fetal and uterine monitoring uses an ultra-sound device to detect FHR and a pressure device to assessuterine activity (Fig. 9-2 and Box 9-3), which is attached to a paper recorder.The FHR is measured via an ultrasound transducer.External baseline, variability, acceler-ations, and decelerations. Erratic FHR recordings or gaps on a paper recorder may be due to inadequate conduction of ultrasound signal displacement of the transducer (may be picking up maternal heart rate), fetal or maternal movement,inadequate ultrasound gel, or fetal arrhythmia (mayneed to auscultate to verify). Contractions are measured via a tocodynamometer, an external uterine monitor.The relative frequency and duration of uterine contractions(UCs), and relative resting tone, which is the tone of theuterus between contractions, can be measured by thismethod. External uterine monitors cannot measurepressure/intensity. Pressure/intensity of the contraction must be estimated by palpation of contractions. Contractions not recording on a paper recorder may be due to transducer not on area of uterus palpated to bestrongest area of contraction; resting tone not dialed to 15-20 mm Hg when uterus is relaxed. Internal Electronic Fetal and Uterine Monitoring Internal electronic fetal monitoring uses a fetal scalp elec-trode (FSE)/internal scalp electrode (ISE) that is applied to the presenting part of the fetus to directly detect FHR. Internal electronic uterine monitoring involves anintrauterine pressure catheter (IUPC) placed in the uterinecavity to directly measure uterine contractions (Fig. 9.3 and Box 9-4). Membranes must be ruptured for both methods(AWHONN, 2009). The decision to insert an FSE is based on the need for con- tinuous FHR tracing when troubleshooting methods do notalter quality of tracing. A nurse or care provider certified toattach this should be aware of relative contraindications todirect methods of monitoring. These include chorioamnionitis,active maternal genital herpes and human immunodeficiencyBOX 9-3 GUIDELINES FOR PLACEMENT OF AN EXTERNAL ELECTRONIC FETALMONITOR Explain the procedure to the woman and her family. Forexample: \"The monitor records your baby's heart rate, uterine contractions, and tells us the baby's response to uterine contractions. We place twomonitors on your abdomen and secure them with belts. You can movearound in bed and we will adjust the monitors.\"FHR UCs Use Leopold's maneuver tolocate f et al back.

IUPC monitoring is initiated based on the clinical need for additional uterine activity information. It may be usedwhen external monitoring is inadequate due to maternalobesity or due to lack of progress in labor when quantita-tive analysis of uterine activity is needed for clinical deci-sion making. In addition, an IUPC may be inserted to treata worsening Category II tracing (e.g., recurrent variabledecelerations with nadir greater than 60 mm Hg frombaseline) via amnioinfusion. IUPCs provide an objectivemeasure of the frequency and duration of contractions, aswell as the intensity of contractions (as opposed to palpa-tion, which is subjective) and resting tone both expressedin mm Hg.FHR is measured via an internal fetal spiral electrode(FSE).Internal EFM detects FHR baseline, variability, accelera-tions, decelerations, and limited information on some typesof arrhythmias. It is attached to the presenting part of the fetus by thenurse or care provider. Contractions are measured via an intrauterine pressurecatheter (IUPC).IUPC provides an objective measure of the pressure of contractions expressed as mm Hg.IUPC monitoring can detect actual frequency, duration,and strength of UCs and resting tone in mm Hg. Uterine contraction intensity is measured using anIUPC = Peak pressure minus the baseline pressure in mm Hg. Contraction intensity varies during labor, from 30 mm Hgin early spontaneous labor to 70 mm Hg in transition to70-90 mm Hg in the second stage. Peak pressure is the maximum uterine pressure during a contraction measured with an IUPC. Resting tone orbaseline pressure is the uterine pressure between contrac- tions and should be about 5-25 mm Hg. The contraction and resting tone intensity is a combina-tion of pressure from myometrial muscle contraction as wellas intrauterine hydrostatic pressure (pressure exerted fromamniotic fluid above the catheter). Therefore, positioningof the patient\u2014measuring IUPC pressures in left, right,supine, and possible erroneous con-clusions about induction or augmentation management(AWHONN, 2009). Uterine contractions may also be quantified viaMontevideo units (MVUs) measured by the peak pressurefor each contraction in a 10-minute period. ACOG hasrecommended at least 200 MVUs every 10 minutes for 2 hours as adequate uterine contraction intensity for normal progress of labor. An IUPC can be used to perform an amnioinfusion. The IUPC is inserted by the care provider. Some insti-tutions may have protocols for nurses to insert IUPCs;nurses need to check hospital policy on IUPC insertion. Telemetry This is a type of continuous electronic fetal monitoring whichinvolves connecting the patient to a radio frequency transmit-ter that allows the patient to walk and take a bath withouthaving to be connected to the monitor. Nurses can overseethe fetal and uterine information as if the patient were con-nected directly to the monitor (Tucker et al., 2009). It can beused in all phases of labor. Monitor Paper Used for the Electronic Fetal Monitor Monitor paper is used for EFM (Fig. 9-4). Assuming that thepaper speed is 3 cm per minute (standard for the UnitedStates), each dark vertical line represents 1 minute and eachlighter vertical line represents 10 seconds. The FHR is recorded on the top grid of the paper while uterine contractions are recorded on the lower grid. SomeEFM systems allow for maternal pulse (obtained via a pulseoximeter attached to the laboring mother) also to be recordedon the paper in the top grid. Clinicians may need this addi-tional information to distinguish between maternal and fetalheart rate. Both external and internal fetal monitors mayinadvertently pick up maternal rate, which is especially criti-cal if the fetus is not tolerating labor or actually dead(Murray, 2004).BOX 9-4 GUIDELINES FOR PLACEMENT OF AN INTERNAL ELECTRONIC FETALMONITOR Explain the procedure to the woman and her family. For example: \"The internal fetal scalp electrode allows us to directly monitor your baby's heart rate. It is clipped on the baby's scalp with a vaginal exam andthe monitor is attached to your leg. You can still move around and go tothe bathroom.\" \"The intrauterine pressure catheter tells us exactly how strong your contractions are. It is a direct measurement of the pressure of yourcontractions. It is placed in your uterus with a vaginal exam.\"FHR UCs Placement of the FSE requiresskills and t echniques of vagi- nal e xamination and EFM as well as risks, limitations, andcontraindications (primarilypreexisting infections such asherpes or HIV). For placement of FSE, a vaginal exam is performedand the guide tube with theelectrode is advanced andattached to the presentingpart of the fetus.Placement of an IUPC is aninvasive procedure where thenurse should have knowl-edge and understanding ofindications and contraindi-cations and risks of internalmonitoring. For placementof the IUPC, the manufacturerdirections are reviewed asthere are several types ofIUPC with different set-upguidelines. The IUPC and theguide tube are inserted in thevagina with a vaginal exam,and the catheter is advancedthrough the cervix into theuterus.3704_Ch09_233-260 16/09/13 10:14 AM Page 237INFLUENCES ON FETAL HEART RATE An understanding of FHR physiology aids in the interpreta-tion of FHR patterns. The FHR responds to multiple physi-ological factors. The following sections review the influenceson the FHR. Utero-Placental Unit At term, about 10%-15% of maternal cardiac output (600-750 mL) perfuses the uterus per minute. Oxygenated bloodfrom the mother is delivered to the intervillous space in theplacenta via the uterine arteries. Maternal-fetal exchange ofoxygen, carbon dioxide, nutrients, waste products, and wateroccurs in the intervillous space across the membranes thatseparate fetal and maternal circulations. Oxygen and carbonUNIT 3 The Intrapartal Period 238 AWHONN STANDARDS FOR FREQUENCY OF ASSESSMENT OF FHR Frequency of FHR assessment is based on assessment of riskstatus, stage of labor, and ongoing clinical assessment(AWHONN, 2008a; Lyndon & Ali, 2009) (Box 9-5; Fig. 9-5).The frequency of assessment increases:When indeterminate Category II or abnormal Category IIIFHR characteristics are heard Before and after rupture of membranes or administrationof medication When indeterminate or abnormal characteristics areheard, electronic FHR monitoring is used to:Clarify pattern interpretation Assess baseline variability Further assess fetal status In the presence of risk factors, continuous EFM is recommended and the FHR should be evaluated:Every 15 minutes in the active phase Every 5 minutes while pushing It is common practice for all women to have a baselineEFM tracing of at least 20 minutes at the time they arefirst evaluated in labor. Routine continuous FHR monitoring remains contro-versial.

(2008). Continuous cardiotocography (CTG) as a form of electronicfetal monitoring (EFM) for fetal assessment during labour. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, (4). A review was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety ofroutine continuous EFM of labor with intermittent ausculta-tion using the results of published randomized controlled tri-als (RCTs). This review found 12 trials involving over 37,000women. But most studies were not of high quality, and thereview was dominated by one large, well-conducted trial ofalmost 13,000 women who received care from one personthroughout labor in a hospital where the membranes eitherruptured spontaneously or were artificially ruptured as earlyas possible and oxytocin stimulation of contractions wasused in about a quarter of the women. There was no differ-ence in the number of babies who died during or shortly afterlabor (about 1 in 300). Neonatal seizures in babies were rare(about 1 in 500 births), but they occurred significantly lessoften when continuous EFM was used to monitor fetal heartrate. There was no difference in the incidence of cerebralpalsy, although other possible long-term effects have notbeen fully assessed and need further study. Continuous mon-itoring was associated with a significant increase in cesareansection and instrumental vaginal births. Both procedures areknown to carry the risks associated with a surgical procedure,although the specific adverse outcomes have not beenassessed in the included studies. Authors' ConclusionsContinuous EFM during labor is associated with a reduc- tion in neonatal seizures, but there are no significant differ-ences in cerebral palsy, infant mortality, or other standardmeasures of neonatal well-being. However, continuous EFMwas associated with an increase in cesarean sections andinstrumental vaginal births. The authors believe the real chal-lenge is how best to convey this uncertainty to women toenable them to make an informed choice without compro-mising the normality of labor. A decision tree for managing fetal assessment may be utilized (Fig. 9-5).3704_Ch09_233-260 16/09/13 10:14 AM Page 238CHAPTER 9 Fetal Heart Rate Assessment 239 Sufficient placental area Unconstricted umbilical cord Appropriate oxygenation to the fetus depends on:Adequate oxygenation of the mother Adequate blood flow to the placenta Adequate uteroplacental circulation Adequate umbilical circulation The fetus's own innate ability to initiate compensatorymechanisms to regulate the FHR Additional factors in the fetal environment that influencefetal oxygenation include:Uteroplacental function Uterine activity Umbilical cord issues Maternal physiological function Having a basic understanding of the extrinsic influenceon FHR, such as normal physiological changes in preg-nancy, uterine and placental blood flow, and umbilicalblood flow, improves the nurse's ability to assess FHRpatterns (Lyndon & Ali, 2009) The influences related to labor are discussed in Chapter 10. Autonomic Nervous SystemParasympathetic Nervous System Parasympathetic stimulation decreases the heart rate. The parasympathetic nervous system is primarily mediatedby vagus nerve innervating sinoatrial (SA) and atrioven-tricular (AV) nodes in the heart. Vagus nerve stimulation slows FHR and helps maintainvariability.Variability in FHR develops at 28-30 weeks of gestation.BOX 9-5 STANDARDS FOR FREQUENCY FOR FHR ASSESSMENT Intermittent Auscultation (IA)In the absence of risk factors, FHR should be auscultated: Every 1 hour in the latent phase of labor Every 5-30 minutes in the active and transition phase Every 5-15 minutes in the second stage In the presence of risk factors (e.g., when there is thick meconium, the mother has a fever, or there is an obvious prob-lem with the placenta, or when the fetus is not tolerating thestress of labor well as evidenced by late decelerations), contin-uous EFM is recommended. Intermittent auscultation can only interpret Category I and Category II FHR characteristics as all Category III patternsinclude assessment of FHR variability not possible with inter-mittent auscultation (IA).Intermittent Electronic Fetal Monitoring (EFM)In the absence of risk factors, FHR should be evaluated: Every 30 minutes in the active phase of labor Every 5-15 minutes in the second stage, although typically inthe second stage there is continuous EFM. In the presence of risk factors, continuous EFM is recommended. Source: Lyndon & Ali (2009).

Nerves are distributed widely in the fetal heart, and stim-ulation produces an increase in strength of fetal heartcontraction. SNS is responsible for FHR variability. Action occurs through release of norepinephrine. Stimulation of SNS increases fetal heart rate. SNS may be stimulated during hypoxemia. Baroreceptors Baroreceptors are stretch receptors in the aortic arch andthe carotid arch which detect pressure changes. They provide a protective homeostatic mechanism forregulating heart rate by stimulating a vagal responseand decreasing FHR, fetal blood pressure, and cardiacoutput. Central Nervous System (CNS) CNS is the integrative center responsible for variations inFHR and baseline variability related to fetal activity. CNS regulates and coordinates autonomic activities. Mediates cardiac and vasomotor reflexes Responds to fetal movement Chemoreceptors Chemoreceptors are located in the aortic arch and thecentral nervous system (CNS). They respond to changes in fetal O 2and CO2and pH levels. Decreased O2and increased CO2cause peripheral chemoreceptors to stimulate the vagal nerveand slow the heart rate, and central chemoreceptorsrespond to an increased heart rate and an increasedblood pressure. Hormonal Regulation The fetus responds to a decrease in O2or uteroplacental blood flow by releasing hormones that maximize bloodflow to vital organs such as the heart, brain, and adrenals. Epinephrine, norepinephrine, catecholamines, and vaso-pressin facilitate oxygenation. hypoxia causes arelease of epinephrine norepinephrine that increasesFHR and increases bloodpressure in response to hypoxia. Renin-angiotensin secreted by the kidneys producesvasoconstriction in response to hypovolemia. FETAL RESERVES Placental reserve describes the reserve oxygen available to thefetus to withstand the transient changes in blood flow andoxygen during labor (Lyndon & Ali, 2009). In a healthymaternal-fetal unit, the placenta provides oxygen and nutri-ents beyond the baseline needs of the fetus.When oxygen is decreased, blood flow is deferred to vitalfetal organs to compensate. When placental reserves of oxygen are decreased ordepleted, the fetus may not be able to adapt to or tolerate decreased oxygen that occurs during a laborcontraction. Fetal adaptation to the stresses of labor occurs throughhomeostatic mechanisms.Prolonged or repeated hypoxemia may deplete reserves,resulting in decompensation. Interpretation of FHR data requires the ability to differentiate three types of fetal responses: Nonhypoxic reflex responses such as FHR accelerations Compensatory responses to hypoxemia, such as variable deceler decompensation r esponses such as late deceler ations (Lyndon & Ali, 2009) Umbilical Cord Blood Acid-Base Analysis After Delivery Umbilical cord blood acid-base acidosis analysis can be a use-ful objective way to quantify fetal acid base balance at birth.An understanding of respiratory and metabolic acidosis andacidemia and associated clinical applications is required tointerpret the findings (AWHONN, 2009). Although maternal and fetal components of oxygen trans- port are similar, there are features of oxygen transport thatare unique to the fetus. Fetal oxygen transport is directlydependent on the maternal transport system. The fetus haslower oxygen tension (25%) than the adult (100%). Fetuseshave higher oxygen affinity (due to different fetal hemoglo-bin) than adults. The amount of oxygen being transported tothe fetus may be affected by the sufficiency of blood flow tothe uterus and placenta, the integrity of the placenta, and theflow of blood through the umbilical cord. Normally, the fetus is able to maintain normal aerobic metabolism even though there are transient decreases inblood flow to the uterus. However, when available oxygen inthe intervillous space falls below 50% of normal levels, thereis a sequential process that occurs: 1)Redistribution of blood to vital organs (heart, brain, andadrenal glands). In scenarios when oxygen is alteredchronically, fetal growth will decelerate and lead tointrauterine growth retardation. 2)Fetal myocardium will change in oxygen consumption,leading to changes in FHR such as fetal heart variability. 3)Fetus will convert from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism.In fetal heart muscle cells, normal cellular metabolism utilizes glucose and oxygen or aerobic metabolism. Carbondioxide and water are the waste products that need to betaken away from the muscle cell by the fetal blood flow andincrease of hydrogen ions in the tissue (acidosis).3704_Ch09_233-260 16/09/13 10:14 AM Page 240CHAPTER 9 Fetal Heart Rate Assessment 241 When the fetus experiences hypoxia, the fetus may switch to anaerobic metabolism, which is non-oxygendependent. The waste product produced during this processis lactic acid. Accumulation of this acid leads to cell deathand eventually to acidemia (increase of hydrogen ions in theblood). Shortly after birth, blood is drawn from the umbilical vein and one of the umbilical arteries. The umbilical vein representsoxygen supply available to the fetus, and the arterial blood bestrepresents fetal usage of oxygen because it is the end point offetal metabolism as blood returns to the placenta. Respiratory acidosis occurs when an elevated P CO2 level is present. An elevated P CO2 is indicative that the fetus is still processing oxygen via aerobic metabolism. It can develop rap-idly in the fetus during acute hypoxia but can also be correctedrapidly when carbon dioxide is allowed to diffuse. Base excesswith acidemia, during anaerobic metabolism, can become ele-vated. With a normal P CO2, it may reflect a prolonged hypoxic insult (Tucker et al., 2009). The following box contains normal values for umbilical cord blood. Note that greater absolute values for base deficitor excess (bicarbonate concentration which increases to com-pensate for greater hydrogen ion concentration) are associatedwith acidemia. Also, acidemia is determined by the pH level.Our goal for a vigorous infant at birth is a pH of 7.1 and a base excess of -12 (Box 9-6). NICHD Criteria for Interpretation of FHR Patterns A variety of systems and terminology have been used in the interpretation of FHR patterns. The FHR should beinterpreted within the context of the overall clinical circum-stances. Clinical conditions that impact FHR patternsinclude gestational age, prior results of fetal assessment,medications, maternal medical conditions, and fetal condi-tions. FHR patterns are dynamic and transient and requirefrequent assessment. A careful review of current evidence hasresulted in a new recommendation for FHR interpretation inthe intrapartum period from NICHD based Component: Three-Tier System).Category I a well-oxygenated, nonacidotic fetus with anormal fetal acid-base balance. They may be followed ina routine manner and no action is required. Category II FHR tracings are indeterminate. They arenot predictive of abnormal fetal acid-base status, yetthere is not adequate evidence to classify them asCategory I or III. They require evaluation and contin-ued surveillance and reevaluation in the context of theclinical circumstances. Category III FHR tracings are abnormal. They are predictive of abnormal fetal acid-base status and require prompt evaluation. Depending on the clinicalsituation, efforts to resolve the underlying cause of the abnormal fetal heart rate pattern should be madeexpeditiously.

There must be at least 2 minutes of identifiablebaseline segments (not necessarily contiguous) in a 10-minuteperiod or the baseline for that period is indeterminate.Characteristics The normal range is 110-160 bpm. FHR baseline above 160 bpm for at least 10 minutes istachycardia. FHR baseline below 110 bpm for at least 10 minutes isbradycardia. Medical Management Assess the baseline over a 10-minute period. Nursing Actions Assess the baseline over 10-minute period. Fetal Tachycardia Tachycardia is a FHR above 160 bpm that lasts for at least 10 minutes (Fig. 9-7).Tachycardia may be a sign of early fetal hypoxemia, espe-cially with decreased variability and decelerations. If tachycardia persists above 200-220 bpm, fetal demisemay occur. A number of causes of fetal tachycardia, such as maternalfever or exposure to medications such as terbutaline, donot reflect a risk of abnormal acid-base balance.

Causes Maternal related causes:Fever Infection Chorioamnionitis Dehydration Anxiety Anemia Medications such as betasympathomimetic, sympathomimetic,ketamine, atropine, phenothiazines, and epinephrine Illicit drugsFetal related causes: Infection or sepsis Activity/stimulation Compensatory effort following acute hypoxemia Chronic hypoxemia Fetal tachyarrhythmia Cardiac abnormalities Anemia Medical Management Treat the underlying cause of tachycardia, such as antibioticsfor infection or fluids for dehydration. Consider delivery. Nursing Actions Assess maternal vital signs (particularly temperature andpulse), as maternal fever and tachycardia increase FHR. Initiate interventions to decrease maternal temperature, ifelevated.Give medications as ordered (i.e., antibiotics, antipyretics) Use ice packs to decrease maternal fever.Assess hydration by checking skin turgor, mucous mem-branes, urine specific gravity, and intake and output.Hydrate the woman by oral intake and/or IV fluids. Reduce anxiety by explaining, reassuring, and encouraging. Assess FHR variability and consider need for positionchange or oxygen to promote fetal oxygenation. Decrease or discontinue oxytocin. Notify the physician or midwife. Fetal Bradycardia Fetal bradycardia is a baseline FHR of less than 110 bpm. A decreased FHR can lead to decreased cardiac output,which causes a decrease in umbilical blood flow that leadsto decreased oxygen to the fetus, causing fetal hypoxia. Unresolved bradycardia may result in fetal hypoxia andneeds immediate intervention. Sudden profound bradycardia (less than 80 bpm) is anobstetrical emergency. Bradycardia may be tolerated by the fetus if the FHRremains above 90 bpm with variability. Bradycardia with normal variability may be benign. Bradycardia with loss of variability or late decelerations isassociated with current or impending fetal hypoxia(NICHD, 1997). Sudden, profound bradycardia is an obstetrical emergency. Characteristics FHR less than 110 bpm for more than 10 minutes (Fig. 9-8) Causes Maternal related:Supine Page 244CHAPTER 9 Fetal Heart Rate Assessment 245 Acute maternal cardiopulmonary compromise (cardiac arrest,seizures) Rupture of uterus or vasa previa Placental abruption Medications such as anesthetics and Fetal response to hypoxia Umbilical hypoxemia Late or profound hypoxemia Hypothermia Hypokalemia Chronic fetal head compression Fetal bradyarrythmias Medical Management Intervene related to the cause of bradycardia. Consider delivery. Nursing Actions Confirm if EFM is monitoring FHR versus maternal HR. Assess fetal movement. Assess the fetal response to fetal scalp stimulation. This isdone when FHR is between contractions and when it isdefinitely determined that baseline has changed. Perform a vaginal exam and assess for a prolapsed cord. Assess maternal vital signs (especially blood pressure). Assess hydration and hydrate prn to reduce UCs and variability and other FHR character-istics, consider:Maternal position change (left or right lateral) to promotefetal oxygenation Discontinuing oxytocin to reduce UCs Giving oxygen 10 L/min via nonbreather face mask topromote fetal oxygenationModifying pushing to every other contraction or stoppushing until the FHR recovers to promote fetal oxygenation Encourage open glottis pushing efforts Discourage prolonged or sustained breath holding with pushing Support the woman and her family Notifying the physician or midwife Baseline Variability Baseline variability refers to the fluctuations in the baselineFHR that are irregular in amplitude and frequency. Cyclesportray the peak to trough (rise and fall) of the heart ratewithin its baseline range over a minute. It is the mostimportant predictor of adequate fetal oxygenation and fetalreserve during labor (AWHONN, 2009). It is a reflectionof an intact pathway from the cerebral cortex to the mid-brain (medulla oblongata) to the vagus nerve and finally tothe heart, and an interaction between the fetal sympatheticand parasympathetic nervous system. Accelerations anddecelerations are excluded from the evaluation of baselinevariability. Characteristics Variability is described as follows:Absent: (Fig. bpm range (Fig. 9-10) Moderate: Amplitude from peak to trough 6 bpm to 25 bpm (Fig. 9-11). Moderate variability predicts a well-oxygenated fetus with normal acid-base balance at thetime. Marked: Amplitude range greater than 25 bpm (Fig. 9-12) Minimal or absent variability can occur when the fetus is in a sleep, sedated by certain central nervous system depres-sants, such as opiates or magnesium 3 The Intrapartal Period 246 240210180 150 120 90 60 30240210180 150 120 90 60 30 Figure 9-9 Absent variability (abnormal).

Minimal orabsent variability can also be significant for presence of fetalhypoxia or acidosis especially if persisting over 60 minutesdespite interventions as listed below. Causes of Minimal or Absent Variability Maternal-related:Supine hypotension Cord compression Uterine tachysystole Drugs (prescription, illicit drugs, alcohol) Fetal-related:Fetal sleep PrematurityMedical Management Consider artificial rupture of membranes (AROM) and more invasive internal monitoring with fetal spiralelectrode (FSE). Manage cause of decreased variability. Consider delivery. Nursing Actions Change the maternal position to promote fetal oxygenation. Assess fetal response to fetal scalp stimulation or vibroa-coustic stimulation (VAS). Assess hydration. Give IV bolus to reduce uterine activityand promote uterine perfusion.3704_Ch09_233-260 16/09/13 10:14 AM Page 246CHAPTER 9 Fetal Heart Rate Assessment 247 Discontinue oxytocin to reduce uterine activity. Deliver oxygen to the woman at 10 L/min via non-breather face mask to promote fetal oxygenation. Consider invasive monitoring such as internal FSE. Support the woman and her family. Notify the physician or midwife. Periodic and Episodic Changes Periodic changes are accelerations or decelerations in the FHR that are in relation to uterine contractions and persistover time. They include accelerations and four types of decel-erations: early, variable, late, and prolonged.Episodic changes are acceleration and deceleration patterns not associated with contractions. Accelerations are the mostcommon episodic change. Fetal Heart Rate Accelerations The presence of FHR accelerations is predictive of adequatecentral fetal oxygenation and reflects the absence of fetalacidemia. They identify a well-oxygenated fetus and requireno intervention. The absence of FHR accelerations, especiallyin the intrapartum period, however, does not Figure 9-11 Moderate variability (normal). Figure 9-12 Marked variability.240210180 150 120 90 60 30240210180 150 120 90 60 30 240210180 150 120 90 60 30240210180 150 120 90 60 303704_Ch09_233-260 16/09/13 10:14 AM Page 247UNIT 3 The Intrapartal Period 248 Characteristics FHR accelerations are the visually abrupt, transient increases (onset to peak <30 seconds) in the FHR above the baseline(Fig. 9-13).They are 15 beats above the baseline and last from 15 seconds to less than 2 minutes. Before 32 weeks' gestation, accelerations are defined asacceleration 10 bpm or greater over the baseline FHR for10 seconds. Prolonged accelerations are 2 minutes, but 10 minutes. Causes Sympathetic response to fetal movement Transient umbilical vein compression Medical Management None Nursing Actions Record accelerations in the woman's labor documentation.Fetal Heart Rate Decelerations Fetal heart rate decelerations are transitory decreases in the FHR baseline. They are classified as early, variable, late, andprolonged decelerations.They are classified according to their shape, timing, andduration in relationship to the contraction. Decelerations are defined as recurrent when they occur with at least 50% of UCs over a 20-minute period Decelerations are defined as intermittent when they occur with fewer than 50% of UCs over a 20-minuteperiod. Early Decelerations Early decelerations are visually apparent, usually symmetrical, with a gradual decrease and return of FHR associated with aUC (Fig. 9-14).They do not occur early or before the contraction starts;thus, this term is something of a misnomer. Figure 9-13 Fetal heart rate accelerations. Figure 9-14 Early decelerations.3704_Ch09_233-260 16/09/13 10:14 AM Page 248CHAPTER 9 Fetal Heart Rate Assessment 249 Characteristics The nadir (the lowest point of the deceleration) occurs at the peak of the contraction. Generally the onset, nadir, and the recovery mirror thecontraction. Causes When a UC occurs, the fetal head is subjected to pressurethat stimulates the vagal nerve. Fetal head compression resulting in increased intracranialpressure, decreased transient cerebral blood flow, and cor-responding decrease in P O2with stimulation of cerebral chemoreceptor (Fig. 9-15) Medical Management None Nursing Actions Early decelerations are benign and no intervention isneeded.Variable Decelerations Avariable deceleration is a visually apparent abrupt decrease in the FHR.They are the most common decelerations seen in labor. When variable decelerations persist over time, fetal toler-ance is confirmed by the presence of variability or acceler-ations in the FHR (Lyndon & Ali, 2009). An acceleration that precedes or follows the decelerationis a shoulder. It is a compensatory response to hypoxemiaand is an increase in the FHR of 20 bpm for < 20 seconds. Characteristics They can be periodic or episodic and may vary in duration,depth or nadir, and timing in relation to UCs (Fig. 9-16). The decrease in FHR is 15 bpm lasting 15 seconds and <2 minutes in duration. The shape can be a U, W, or V. The depth of the deceleration is not related to fetalhypoxemia or acidosis. They can mimic early or late decelerations. CRITICAL COMPONENT Encourage physiologic pushing techniques, alter pushingefforts, or stop pushing, or pushing with every other or everythird UC to provide time for fetus to recover when FHR is inde-terminate or abnormal during the second stage. Support the woman and her family to decrease anxiety or pain, andimprove uterine blood flow and maximize oxygenation to fetus. Obtain fetal acid-base status if possible with scalp or Vas orfetal scalp sampling if available. Abnormal FHR patterns are associated with fetal acidemia. Notify primary provider. The presence of one of the abnormal patterns warrants imme-diate bedside evaluation by a physician who can initiate acesarean birth. Notify or activate OR, anesthesia, and pediatric teams asindicated. Move patient to OR as indicated. When a Category II or III FHR pattern is identified, initial assessment may also include: Assess maternal vital signs, especially: Maternal temperature for maternal fever and maternalblood pressure for hypotension Assess uterine activity for uterine tachysystole. Perform cervical exam to assess for: Umbilical cord prolapse Rapid cervical dilation Rapid descent of fetal headIntrauterine Resuscitation Interventions Interventions for category II and III indeterminate or abnormal FHRpatterns are referred to as intrauterine resuscitation (See Fig. 9-5). These interventions maximize uterine blood flow, umbilical circula-tion, and James, 2005). Interventions include: Maternal positioning to minimize or correct cord compres-sion and decrease frequency of UCs and improve uterineblood flow (either left or right) Administration of IV bolus of fluid of at least 500 mL of lac-tated Ringer's to maximize maternal intravascular volume of O2at 10 L/min via non-rebreather face mask to improve fetal oxygen status Reduction of uterine activity if UCs are too frequent, as theremay be insufcient time for blood to perfuse placenta. Decrease or discontinue oxytocin. Remove cervical ripening agent, if possible. Terbutaline may be used to relax the uterus. Amnioinfusion has been used to resolve variable FHR deceler-ation by correcting umbilical cord compression as a result ofoligohydramnios in the rst stage of labor. Amnioinfusion is a procedure in which a saline solution at room temperature is introduced transcervically via anIUPC to correct the FHR Page 249UNIT The Intrapartal Period 250 An overshoot or rebound overshoot is a gradual smoothacceleration in FHR of 10-20 bpm for >60-90 seconds. Characteristics of normal variable decelerations include:Duration of <60 seconds Rapid return to baseline Accompanied by normal baseline and variability Characteristics of indeterminate or abnormal variabledecelerations include:Prolonged return to baseline Persistence to less than 60 bpm and 60 seconds Presence of overshoots tachycardia Repetitive overshoots and absent variability Causes Umbilical cord occlusion Umbilical cord compression triggers a vagal response thatslows the FHR, usually related to decreased cord perfusion.This results in initial compression of the umbilical vein(decreased P O2and chemoreceptor stimulation) and then compression of the more muscular umbilical arter-ies (fetal hypertension with resultant baroreceptorsstimulation; remember that hypertension is oftenaccompanied with a corresponding drop in heart rate)(see Fig. 9-15). Prolonged cord compression produces a decrease in P O2 with direct myocardial depression, adrenal activation, andrebound tachycardia (note: rebound tachycardia does notalways occur). Variable decelerations can also occur with suddendescent of the vertex late in active phase of labor (i.e., head compression). These appear different from early decelerations in thatthey are usually not repetitive nor smooth or regular inshape.Figure 9-15 Causes and examples of periodic decelerations. Figure 9-16 Variable decelerations.Early deceler ation Fetal head compression FHR 100 50 UC 0Variable deceler ation Umbilical cord compression (CC) Variable 50 UC 0Late deceler ation Uniform shape UC 0Cause: Example: 3704_Ch09_233-260 16/09/13 10:14 AM Page 250CHAPTER 9 Fetal Heart Rate Assessment 251 Characteristics Onset is gradual with onset to nadir 30 seconds (Fig. 9-17). Nadir (lowest point) of the deceleration occurs after thepeak of the contraction. In most cases the onset, nadir, and recovery of thedeceleration occurs after the respective onset, peak, and end of the UC. Nadir decreases 10-20 bpm and rarely 30-40 bpm(Freeman, Garite, & Nageotte, 2003). Causes Reflect fetal response to transient or chronic uteroplacen-tal insufficiency Related to decreased availability of O 2because of utero- placental insufficiency (see Fig. 9-15) Suppression of the fetal myocardium Late decelerations are not completely understood.Usually related to placental insufficiency (in which casethey are often accompanied by decreased or absent FHRvariability) Late decelerations with moderate variability reflect a com-pensatory response and are not associated with significantfetal acidemia. Late decelerations with minimal or absent variability reflecthypoxia and represent a risk of significant fetal acidemia. Can be related to aorto-caval compression or obstetricalanesthesia, in which case they are usually accompanied bymoderate FHR variability and can be corrected by positionchange or improving maternal blood pressure. This lattertype of late deceleration is sometimes referred to as a \"reflexlate deceleration.\" Fetal hypoxia stimulates chemoreceptors when it is acute(i.e., recently occurring) and, if prolonged, results fromdirect myocardial depression. Maternal related factors associated with decreased utero-placental circulation include: Hypotension from regional anesthesia, supine position-ing, hemorrhage Mat ernal hypertension, gestational or chronic Placental changes affecting gas exchange such as post-maturity or placent al abnormalities Decr eased maternal hemoglobin or oxygen saturation from se vere anemia or cardiopulmonary disease Uterine tachysystole Medical Management Interventions are directed at causes of late decelerations. Consider tocolytics. Consider delivery. Nursing Actions (see Critical Component: IntrauterineResuscitation Interventions and Fig. 9-5) The degree to which the deceleration is abnormal dependson the status and response of the fetus after the deceleration. Change the maternal position to promote fetal oxygenation.Medical Management Consider amnioinfusion (see Critical Component:Amnioinfusion). Consider tocolytics. Consider delivery. Nursing Actions (see Critical Component: IntrauterineResuscitation Interventions and Fig. 9-5) Change the maternal position to promote fetal oxygenation. Perform SVE to evaluate cord and labor progress andperform fetal scalp stimulation. Perform amnioinfusion if ordered to alleviate umbilicalcord compression by increasing volume of fluid in uterusand thereby correcting umbilical cord compression (seeCritical Component: Amnioinfusion). Administer O 2at 10 L/min via non-rebreather face mask to improve fetal oxygen status. Decrease or discontinue oxytocin. Consider need for tocolytic to reduce UCs. Consider more invasive monitoring with fetal spiralelectrode (FSE). Modify pushing. Support the woman and her family to decrease anxietyor pain. Notify the physician or midwife. Plan for delivery and care of the neonate. CRITICAL COMPONENT Amnioinfusion Amnioinfusion is a therapeutic option when there are recurrent variable decelerations as a result of decreased amniotic fluid.During amnioinfusion, room temperature normal saline isinfused into the uterus transcervically via an intrauterine pres-sure catheter to increase intraamniotic fluid to cushion theumbilical cord and reduce cord compression.Indications: Variable decelerations in first stage of laborContraindications: Vaginal bleeding, uterine anomalies, and active infectionCareful monitoring of maternal and fetal response is needed; documentation of fluid infused is also important to avoid iatro-genic polyhydramnios. (Lyndon & Ali, 2009, Lyndon, O'Brien-Abel, & Simpson,2014) Late Decelerations Late deceleration is a visually apparent symmetrical gradual decrease of FHR associated with UCs.Late decelerations can be a sign of fetal intolerance tolabor. Fetal tolerance of late decelerations is assessed by evaluat-ing the baseline, presence of variability, and the presenceof accelerations.3704_Ch09_233-260 16/09/13 10:14 AM Page Discontinue oxytocin (consider terbutaline) to reduceuterine activity. Assess hydration. Give an IV bolus to promote fetal oxygenation. Consider fetal scalp stimulation or VAS to assess fetalstatus. Administer O 2at 10 L/min via non-rebreather face mask to improve fetal oxygen status. Consider more invasive monitoring with fetal spiral electrode (FSE). Support the woman and her family. Notify the physician or midwife. Plan for delivery and care of the neonate. Prolonged Decelerations Prolonged deceleration is a visually apparent abrupt decrease in FHR below baseline that is 15 bpm, lasting 2 minutes but <10 minutes (Fig. 9-18).Prolonged decelerations that are not recurrent and arepreceded and followed by normal baseline and moderatevariability are not associated with fetal hypoxemia. Characteristics Episodic decelerations that last >2 minutes and <10 minutes May be abrupt or gradual Causes May be any mechanism that causes a profound change in the fetal O 2 Interruption of uteroplacental perfusionTachysystole Maternal hypotension Abruptio placenta Cord prolapse Vagal stimulationProfound head compression Rapid fetal descentMedical Management Treat the cause of prolonged deceleration. Consider amnioinfusion. Consider tocolytics. Consider delivery. Nursing Actions (see Critical Component: IntrauterineResuscitation Interventions and see Fig. 9-5) Assess baseline variability preceding and following deceleration. Change the maternal position to improve fetal oxygenation. Discontinue oxytocin (consider terbutaline) to decreasethe UCs. Administer O 2at 10 L/min via non-rebreather face mask to improve fetal oxygen status. Assess hydration. Give an IV bolus to promote fetal oxygenation. Perform SVE to assess labor and cord, and perform scalpstimulation. Perform amnioinfusion, if ordered, to alleviate umbilicalcord compression. Consider more invasive monitoring with fetal spiral electrode (FSE). Support the woman and her family. Notify the physician or midwife. Plan for delivery and care of the neonate. Uterine Activity and Contraction Patterns Uterine activity is an integral part of fetal monitoring interpretation. Interpretation of the FHR pattern is done inconcurrence with uterine activity. Interpretation of uterineactivity includes assessment of contractions' frequency,duration, and intensity, and uterine resting tone (Fig. 9-19).Uterine activity can be monitored by palpation or via anIUPC.Frequency of contractions is determined by counting number of contractions in a 10-minute period, count-ing from the start of one contraction to the start of the next contraction in minutes. It is recorded in 100 AM Page 252CHAPTER 9 Fetal Heart Rate Assessment 253 minutes (i.e., frequency of contractions is every 3 minutes). Duration of contractions is measured by counting from the beginning to the end of one contraction andmeasured in seconds. Because contractions often vary in their duration, this is often calculated for severalcontractions and expressed as a range. Intensity is strength of the contraction and measured by palpation, or internally by an IUPC in mm Hg. Resting tone is the pressure in the uterus between con- tractions. It is measured by an IUPC when internal fetalmonitoring is used or by palpation when an externalmonitor is used. It is described as the number of mm Hgwhen the uterus is not contracting when an IUPC isbeing used and as \"soft\" if the uterus feels relaxed by palpation. Normal: 5 or fewer contractions in 10 minutes averaged over a 30-minute window Tachysystole: More than 5 contractions in 10 minutes over a 30-minute window Tachysystole Tachysystole, also referred to as hyperstimulation, is excessive uterine activity (Fig. 9-20).Contraction patterns that may contribute to fetal hypoxia Tachysystole should be treated regardless of fetal response. Tachysystole can result in decreased uteroplacental blood flow andresult in indeterminate or abnormal fetal heart rate patterns. Characteristics of Tachysystole More than 5 contractions in 10 minutes Contractions lasting 2 minutes or longerContractions occurring within 1 minute of each other Increasing resting tone greater than 20-25 mm Hg, peakpressure greater than 80 mm Hg, or Montevideo unitsgreater than 400 Causes Tachysystole can be spontaneous or stimulated labor. Most commonly, tachysystole can be caused by medicationsused for cervical ripening, induction, and augmentation oflabor. Medical Management Manage cause of tachysystole (e.g., discontinuing oxytocin,removing cervical ripening medication). See Chapter 10. Nursing Actions Reducing uterine activity can be accomplished with avariety of interventions, such as the following (these prac-tices are known as intrauterine resuscitation):Changing maternal position Providing hydration Using IV fluid bolus Reducing maternal anxiety or pain Administering a tocolytic (terbutaline) Supporting woman and family SPECIAL MONITORING CIRCUMSTANCES Monitoring the Preterm Fetus As noted in Chapter 7, preterm labor can be defined as theonset of labor at less than 37 weeks' gestation. With the cur-rent preterm birth rate continuing to rise (Martin Prolonged deceleration. Mild, moder ate, strong Interv al (uterine relaxation) Duration (seconds) Frequency (min utes and fr actions of a min ute)Figure 9-19 Example of contraction frequency, duration, intensity, andresting tone.3704_Ch09_233-260 16/09/13 10:14 AM Page 253UNIT 3 The Intrapartal Period 254 monitoring a preterm fetus during the antepartum and intra-partum period is a common occurrence in many obstetricalunits. Two important points to remember when caring for themother with a preterm fetus are:Physiologic responses of the preterm fetus are dependenton the stage of development of the fetus. Physiologic responses and tolerance to stress (maternaltachycardia and sepsis) in the preterm fetus can be different(more rapid deterioration) from those in the term fetus.Characteristics include: Higher baseline although still within normal FHR range Accelerations may be of lower amplitude (see earliersection on accelerations)\u2014accelerations of at least 10 bpm of baseline lasting 10 seconds are considered to be acceptable for fetus less than 32 weeks' gestation(Mascones et al., 2008). However, once the pretermfetus (sometimes as early by 24-26 weeks) demonstratesaccelerations of 15 beats per minute above baseline that last for 15 seconds, the fetus is generally held tothat criteria in subsequent evaluations (Baird & Ruth, 2002). Variability may be decreased, although specific parame-ters have not been quantified (Freeman, Garite, &Nageotte, 2003). Variable decelerations may occur more frequently in the preterm fetus even in the absence of contractions(Druzin, Smith, Gabbe, & Reed, 2007). During labor,variable decelerations occur in approximately 70%-75%of preterm fetuses compared to 30%-50% in term fetuses(Freeman, Garite, & Nageotte, 2003). Late and prolonged decelerations occur at the same fre-quency in preterm labor as in term labor. But conditionsassociated with late decelerations, such as IUGR,preeclampsia, and abruption, C D Figure UC patterns. A. Normal UCs. B. Tachysystole (<5 UCs 10 minutes). C.Tachysystole (tetanic contraction verified by (inadequate interval of resting tone between UCs).3704_Ch09_233-260 16/09/13 10:14 AM Page 254CHAPTER 9 Fetal Heart Rate 255 Magnesium sulfate decreases FHR variability and Beta-sympathomimetics associatedby tachycardia in both mother and fetus.The preterm fetus is more likely to be subjected to hypoxia. These include conditions such as preeclampsia, abruption, andintrauterine infection that frequently are either the indicationfor, or a cause of, preterm delivery. The loss of variability in apreterm fetus is more predictive of acidosis and depressedApgar scores at birth than for a term infant (Froen, Heazell,Tveit, Saaseted, Fretts, & Flenady, 2008). It is therefore important to continually evaluate trends and continually assess the maternal and fetal condition whenmaking clinical decisions regarding the antepartum and intra-partum management of the preterm fetus. Monitoring the Woman with Multiple Gestation Current monitors have the capability of monitoring twins(or higher multiples) at the same time due to the presence oftwo ultrasound transducers on the same monitor. The dualtracings distinguish each fetus by a thicker or darker tracingfor one fetus and a thinner or lighter tracing for the other.To more clearly distinguish between the fetuses, their posi-tions on the mother's abdomen can be documented as wellas the transducers appropriately labeled. In identifying twinsor higher multiples, the more advanced (lower in uterus)fetus is labeled as A, the next one B, and so on. Once themembranes are ruptured, it is recommended that the moreadvanced fetus is monitored by a scalp electrode, to distin-guish it from the other fetus. Two monitors are required forhigher multiples, with the third fetus on the second monitorwhich has an identical clock setting to the first one (Tuckeret al., 2004). At the time of birth, the first twin that is delivered may not necessarily be twin A, especially with cesarean sections. Inthat case, the medical chart should be written as first twin (B)and second twin (A) or vice versa.Other Topics Monitoring of fetal arrhythmias and sinusoidal pattern (aCategory III or impending decompensation fetal response) isbeyond the scope of this chapter.

INTRODUCTION Most pregnant women go into labor spontaneously and have anormal labor and spontaneous vaginal birth. However, inter-ventions to initiate or accelerate labor and birth are increasinglycommon. This chapter presents problems encountered duringlabor and birth and interventions related to those complica-tions. Nurses have a key role in identification of complicationsand implementing nursing actions in response to them toimprove maternal and neonatal outcomes. DYSTOCIA Dystocia is abnormal labor that results from abnormalities of the power, the passenger, or the passage (American Collegeof Obstetrics and Gynecology [ACOG], 2003). It is diag-nosed when there is an alteration in the progress of laborrelated to cervical dilation and/or descent of the fetus.Dystocia is the most common reason for primary cesareansections (Queenan, Hobbins, & Spong, 2005). It is associatedwith the same factors that influence normal labor; the 4 Ps arediscussed in Chapter 8:Powers of labor (uterine contractions [UCs]) Passenger (fetal aspects/position) Passage (pelvis) Psychological response of the woman Dysfunctional labor is abnormal UCs that prevent the normal progress of cervical dilation or descent of the fetus.Abnormal uterine activity typically has a hypertonic or hypo-tonic pattern. The American College of Obstetricians andGynecologists (ACOG, 1995) currently suggests two practi-cal classifications of abnormal labor in the active phase:Protraction disorders: Slower than normal labor Arrest disorders: Complete cessation of UCsThe primary issues impacting nursing care with regard to dystocia are related to uterine factors, which are described in 261Don't have time to read this chapter?

Other factors are presented in Chapter 8. Riskfactors for dystocia include:Congenital uterine abnormalities such as bicorniateuterus Malpresentation as occiput posterior, Cephalopelvic disproportion Tachysystole of the uterus with oxytocin Maternal fatigue and dehydration Administration of analgesia or anesthesia early in labor Extreme maternal fear or exhaustion, which can resultin catecholamine release interfering with uterine contractility. Hypertonic Uterine Dysfunction Hypertonic uterine dysfunction is uncoordinated uterineactivity. Contractions are frequent and painful but ineffectivein promoting dilation and effacement. When this occurs inearly labor it may be referred to as prodromal labor. Women who experience hypertonic uterine dysfunction are at risk forexhaustion related to the prolonged labor, and the fetus is atrisk for fetal intolerance of labor and asphyxia related todecreased placental profusion. Risk Factors Nulliparous woman are more subject to abnormal early labor. Assessment Findings Painful, frequent UCs with inadequate uterine relaxationbetween UCs with little cervical changes (Fig. 10-1B). May be Category II (indeterminate) or Category III(abnormal) fetal heart rate (FHR) related to prolongedlabor and inadequate uterine relaxation Medical Management Evaluate labor progress. Evaluate cause of labor dysfunction. Hydrate to improve uterine perfusion and coordination of UCs. Provide pain management to allow the woman to sleepand prevent exhaustion. Nursing Actions Promote rest to try to break the pattern of frequent but ineffective UCs. The pattern typically becomes effec-tive when the woman sleeps for a period of several hoursand awakens in a normal labor pattern of active labor.Methods used to promote uterine rest are:Administration of pain medication such as Demerol ormorphine as per order to decrease labor contractions andallow the uterus to rest Promotion of relaxation Warm shower or tub bath Quiet environment Minimal interruptions to allow for long period of sleepHydrate the woman with IV or PO fluids if tolerated.Dehydration can result in dysfunctional labor. Assess FHR and UCs. Evaluate labor progress with a sterile vaginal exam (SVE). Inform the woman and family of the progress of laborand explain interventions. Inform the care provider of the woman's response andprogress in labor. Hypotonic Uterine Dysfunction Hypotonic uterine dysfunction occurs when the pressure of the UC is insufficient (IUPC pressure <25 mm Hg) to pro-mote cervical dilation and effacement (Gilbert & Harmon,2003). Typically, the woman makes normal progress duringthe latent phase of labor, but during active labor the UCsbecome weaker and less effective for cervical changes andlabor progress (see Fig. 10-1A). The woman is at risk forexhaustion and infection related to the prolonged labor, andthe fetus is at risk for fetal intolerance of labor and asphyxia. Risk Factors Multiparous women often have more problems in theactive phase. Extreme fear may result in catecholamine release, inter-fering with uterine contractility. Assessment Findings Decreased frequency, strength, and duration of UCs Little or no cervical changeLess than 0.5 cm/hr progress in cervical dilation for aprimiparous woman in active labor Less than 1.0 cm/hr progress in cervical dilation for amultiparous woman in active labor Increased fear and anxiety levels Medical Management Evaluate labor progression. Determine the cause of the dysfunction. Consider obstetrical interventions:Augment labor with oxytocin. Perform amniotomy. Perform cesarean birth when other interventions havefailed or when there are signs of fetal intolerance of labor. Nursing Actions Assess uterine activity. Assess maternal and fetal status. Stimulate uterine activity to achieve a normal labor pattern using the following methods:Ambulate and change the position of the woman to promote comfort and labor progress. Hydrate with IV or PO as per orders as dehydration canresult in dysfunctional labor. Administer IV fluids to maximize maternal fluid volume,to correct maternal hypotension and improve placentalperfusion. Augment labor with oxytocin as per protocol.3704_Ch10_261-290 16/09/13 10:14 AM Page 262CHAPTER 10 High-Risk Labor and Birth 263 Evaluate labor progress with SVE. Inform the woman and the family of the progress of laborand explain interventions. Provide emotional support. Anxiety levels can increasedue to prolonged labor; increased anxiety and fear caninterfere with effective UCs. Maintain good aseptic technique to minimize the risk ofinfection if ROM.Minimize vaginal exams. Maintain perineal cleanliness. Inform the care provider of the woman's response andprogress in labor. Precipitous Labor Precipitous labor is a labor that lasts fewer than 3 hours fromonset of labor to birth. The current rate of precipitous laborfor women is 2.4% (Martin et al., 2011). Women who expe-rience a precipitous labor often have higher anxiety and painlevels related to the rapid and intense labor experience.Precipitous labor and/or birth places the woman at risk forpostpartum hemorrhage related to uterine atony or lacera-tions. It places the fetus/neonate at risk for hypoxia and at riskfor central nervous system (CNS) depression related tohypoxia from the rapid birth. Risk Factors Grand multiparity History of precipitous labor Assessment Findings Hypertonic UCs (tetanic UCs) that are occurring every 2 minutes or more frequently, lasting greater than 60 seconds and strong (Fig. 10-2). Potential for Category II (indeterminate) or Category III(abnormal) FHR and nursing actions are based on FHRpattern (see Chapter 9). Rapid cervical dilation such that labor is less than 3 hours. Medical Management Prepare for and stand by for precipitous birth. 100 80604020 0100 Hypertonic versus hypotonic versus normal uterine contractions. A. Hypotonic uterine contraction pattern. B. Hypertonic uterine contraction pattern. C. Normal uterinecontraction The Intrapartal Period 264 Nursing Actions Remain in the room with the woman since birth is oftenvery rapid with precipitous labor. Monitor FHR and UCs every 15 minutes. Assess labor progress and cervical change closely withsterile vaginal exams (SVEs).Assess the cervix if the woman states she feels pressure or feels like \"the baby is coming!\" It may be a sign ofimpending birth. Support the woman and the family. This type of laborcan be frightening, overwhelming, and painful. Anticipate potential maternal postpartum complicationssuch as hemorrhage and lacerations. Anticipate potential neonatal complications such ashypoxia and CNS depression related to rapid birth. Prepare for delivery. Inadequate Expulsive Forces Inadequate expulsive forces occur in the second stage of laborwhen the woman is not able to push or bear down. It was pre-viously thought that limiting the second stage to 2 hours wasessential to decrease fetal morbidity and mortality. It is nowknown that waiting beyond 2 hours is safe for the fetus andthe 2-hour time frame is no longer clinically valid.The fetus is at higher risk for asphyxia related to pro-longed second stage of labor. The woman with a prolonged second stage, beyond 4 hours, is at risk for operative vaginal birth and perinealtrauma. Risk Factors Maternal exhaustion Epidural anesthesia because woman may not feel the urgeto push Assessment Findings Inadequate or ineffective pushing with little or no descentof the fetal head with expulsive pushing efforts Potential for Category II (indeterminate) or Category III(abnormal) FHR Medical Management Evaluate the woman's progress, maternal-fetal status, andlikelihood of vaginal birth. Augment with oxytocin. Assist birth with vacuum or forceps. Perform cesarean birth when other interventions are inef-fective or signs of fetal intolerance to labor. Nursing Actions Assess fetal descent. Evaluate fetal response to expulsive pushing. Facilitate the second stage of labor by doing the following:Coaching the woman in bearing-down efforts Minimizing the Valsalva maneuver by using open glottispush strategiesMaintaining adequate pain relief for the woman withlabor epidurals Changing the maternal position to a more upright positionto facilitate fetal descent Supporting the woman's involuntary pushing efforts Fetal Dystocia Fetal dystocia may be caused by excessive fetal size, malpre- sentation, multifetal pregnancy, or fetal anomalies. The fetuscan move through the birth canal most effectively when thehead is flexed and is presenting anterior to the woman's pelvis(occiput anterior position). This allows the smallest diameterof the fetal head to enter the maternal pelvis and the mostflexible part of the fetal body, the back of the neck, to adaptto the curve of the birth canal. When the fetal position isother than flexed and vertex or the fetus is large in compari-son to the maternal pelvis, labor may be difficult and vaginalbirth a challenge. Complications of fetal dystocia are:Neonatal asphyxia related to prolonged labor Fetal injuries, such as bruising Maternal lacerations Cephalopelvic disproportion disproportion is a condition in which the size, shape, or position of the fetal head prevents it from passingthrough the lateral aspect of the maternal pelvis orwhen the maternal pelvis is of a size or shape that prevents the descent ofthe fetus through the pelvis. A diagnosis of CPD often necessi-tates a cesarean birth. CPD can rarely be diagnosed until laborhas progressed for some time. The success of any labor depends on the complex interrela- tionship of several factors: Fetal size, presentation, and position Size and shape of the maternal pelvis Quality of the UCs Risk Factors Abnormal fetal presentation or position such as face,brow, or breech (Table 10-1) Fetal anomalies, such as hydrocephalus, and/or any otherfetal anomaly that interferes with fetal descent throughthe birth canal Fetal macrosomia; birth weight greater than 4500 g Assessment Findings FHR may be heard above the umbilicus versus in thelower uterine segment; this is a sign that the fetus may bein position other than vertex. The SVE reveals a buttocks or face when malpresentationis the cause of dystocia. The presenting part is not engaged in the maternal pelvis. There is no fetal descent through the pelvis.3704_Ch10_261-290 16/09/13 10:14 AM Page 264CHAPTER 10 High-Risk Labor and Birth 265 TABLE 10-1 MALPRESENTATION OF THE FETUS MALPRESENTATION DESCRIPTION IMPLICATIONS OCCIPUT POSTERIOR FACE PRESENTATION BROW PRESENTATION SHOULDER PRESENTATION/COMPOUND PRESENTATIONThe occiput of the fetus is in the poste- rior portion of the pelvis rather thanthe anterior. As the fetus movesthrough the birth canal, the occiputbone presses on the woman's sacrum. Rotation of fetal head may occur during fetal descent. Fetal head is in extension rather than flexion as it enters the pelvis. Fetal head presents in a position mid- way between full flexion and extremeextension. This causes the largestdiameter of the head to engage in thepelvis. Shoulder presentation: The fetal spine is vertical to the maternal pelvis. Compound presentation: One or more fetal extremities accompany the presenting part.Prolonged labor and prolonged second stage Severe back pain Labor and pushing may be prolonged. Cesarean delivery may be indicated. The neonate's face may have extensive bruising. Prolonged second stage of labor. Higher risk of prolapsed cord.Cesarean delivery is typically indicated.

Determine the type of obstetrical interventions, such as useof vacuum extractor, forceps, or need for cesarean birth. Nursing Actions Perform Leopold's maneuver as described in Chapter 8 todetermine the fetal position. Assess the location of the FHR. Assess the fetal position with SVE. Alert the care provider if there is any question regardingfetal presentation, position, or absence of fetal descent. Pelvic Dystocia Pelvic dystocia is related to the contraction of one or more of the three planes of the pelvis. During the prenatal period, the careprovider determines the general pelvic size and configuration byvaginal examination. Pelvic measurements are not typicallydone. Descent and engagement of fetal head in labor indicateadequate pelvic inlet. The outcome of labor is dependent on theinterrelationship of the size and shape of the pelvis, fetal size,presentation and position, and quality of the UCs (see CriticalComponent: Cephalopelvic Disproportion). The three contractions of the pelvic planes are: Inlet contraction occurs when the widest part of thepelvis is small. Midpelvis contraction related to prominent ischial spines,convergent pelvic side walls, and a narrow sacrosciaticnotch may result in arrest of descent of the vertex. Outlet contraction can be estimated by measuring thetransverse diameter of the pelvis. Normally, the antero-posterior diameter is 14 cm. Risk Factors Small pelvis Abnormal pelvic shape Assessment Findings Delayed descent of fetal head Medical Management Evaluate the pelvis for contraction of one or more of theplanes of the pelvis. Evaluate the descent and engagement of the fetal head. Nursing Actions Perform SVE to evaluate the progress of labor and fetaldescent into pelvis (i.e. check station). Maternal Obesity The World Health Organization and the National Institute of Health define obesity as a BMI of 30 or greater. Maternalobesity was recognized as a risk factor in pregnancy more than50 years ago. A global epidemic of obesity is unfolding,resulting in new challenges for the management of obesity inup to 30% of pregnant women. The obstetric complications ofmaternal obesity are generally related to issues of maternalpre-pregnancy obesity rather than excessive weight gain during pregnancy (Catalano, 2007). Maternal obesity is a well-established risk factor for the development of preeclampsia,gestational diabetes, and thrombosis. The impact on pregnan-cy also translates to complications in labor, including laborinduction, cesarean births, and failed vaginal birth after cesare-an (Ramachenderan, Bradford, & McLean, 2008; Morin &Reilly, 2007). It is currently recommended that every perinataldepartment should have policies and practices specific to thispatient population (Maher, 2014). Risks at Delivery Abnormal progress of labor Fetal macrosomia Shoulder dystocia Higher rates of operative vaginal birth and cesarean birth Performing epidural or spinal anesthesia on morbidlyobese patients may be extremely problematic. Not only do obese women experience higher rates of failedvaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC), but obese womenwho have a VBAC experience higher rates of infection. Increased postoperative complications including woundinfection, delayed wound healing, excessive blood loss,DVT, and endometritis (Catalano, 2007) Assessment Findings Delayed descent of fetal head Abnormal labor progress Nursing Actions Anticipate impact of pregnancy complications listedabove on labor and birth. Assess for normal progress of labor. Assure that patient beds, examining tables, and chairs cansupport patient's weight. Facilitate patient positioning for administering epiduralanalgesia to obese women. LABOR INTERVENTIONS The majority of pregnant women go into labor spontaneouslyat term (37-42 weeks' gestation) and progress through thelabor and birth experience without complications. Increasingly,the approach to labor has shifted from a natural process to onethat should be \"managed\" by the woman, nurse, and careprovider. Management of labor has resulted in an increase inlabor interventions, including induction of labor (which mayalso include cervical ripening) and augmentation to speed uplabor. This section reviews interventions to induce (initiate)and augment (strengthen) labor. Labor interventions are medically indicated when either the condition or safety of the woman or fetus would beimproved with birth. Because spontaneous labor is associatedwith fewer complications than induced labor, induction oflabor without a medical indication is discouraged. Despite risks to the woman and fetus (such as increased rates of cesarean birth), labor interventions such as electiveinduction are at an all-time high (see Critical Component:Elective Induction of Labor). Because of the potential risks3704_Ch10_261-290 16/09/13 10:14 AM Page 267UNIT 3 The Intrapartal Period 268 The nurse may face a dilemma when women are admitted for induction or cervical ripening without documented indica-tions for the induction. It is the nurse's responsibility to ensurethat the woman is fully informed by her provider before begin-ning a procedure (Simpson, 2009). Induction of labor is a complex intervention that leads to a \"cascade of interventions\" that typically includes:Intravenous (IV) fluids Activity restriction or bed rest More frequent or continuous electronic fetal monitoring Increased pain medication use and epidural anesthesia Amniotomy Prolonged stay in the labor Atterbury, 2003; Simpson & O'Brien-Abel, 2013)A number of methods of induction of labor have been pro- posed as effective in initiating labor. When the decision hasbeen made to induce labor, the next important question raisedis how to induce labor. When deciding on the method of induc-tion of labor, certain clinical factors are considered, including:Parity Status of membranes: Ruptured or intact Status of the cervix: Favorable or unfavorable History of previous cesarean birthsAll these factors or clinical situations are thought to be important to a provider in making the decision about whichmethod of labor induction should be used. Labor inductionis thought to be less successful when the cervix is unfavor-able (not ripe). It is more successful in parous women thanin nulliparous women. Little attention has been given to thecombination of these factors, which may be important towomen and clinicians when attempting to make informeddecisions about induction of labor (Kelly, Alfirevic,Hofmeyr, Kavanagh, Neilson, & Thomas, 2009). Oxytocin Induction A pharmacological for induction of labor is adminis-tration of oxytocin. Oxytocin is the most common inductionagent used worldwide to initiate labor. It has been used alone,in combination with amniotomy, or after cervical ripeningwith other pharmacological or non-pharmacological meth-ods. Before the introduction of prostaglandin agents, oxytocinwas used as a cervical ripening agent as well.Endogenous oxytocin is a peptide synthesized to the posterior lobe ofthe pituitary gland, where it is released in the maternalcirculation in response to vaginal and cervical stretching.The release of oxytocin stimulates UCs. Synthetic oxytocin is identical to endogenous response occurs to oxytocin in 3-5 minutes,with a half-life of 10 minutes. Considerable controversy exists related to dose and rateincrease intervals when oxytocin is used for induction oflabor.There was a trend to use higher doses of oxytocin, termed \"active management of labor\" (Box 10-1). with induction of labor, elective induction shouldbe undertaken only after fully informing the woman of risksand benefits and establishing a gestational age of 39 weeks orgreater. The nurse providing care for the woman during cervical ripening, induction, or augmentation of labor shouldbe aware of the indications, actions, expected results, andpotential risks of each agent. Before any agent is used, maternalstatus and fetal well-being should be established and cervicalstatus should be assessed and documented (Simpson, 2009). Labor Induction Induction of labor is the deliberate stimulation of UCs before the onset of spontaneous labor to facilitate a vaginal delivery.According to the National Center for Health Statistics, therate of induction of labor has increased significantly duringthe past 15 years from an induction rate of 9.5% in 1990 to23.2% in 2009, more than a 100% increase (Martin et al.,2011). Data show that outcomes for newborns are greatlyimproved when gestation is longer than 39 weeks. Yet studiesindicate that almost one-third of all babies delivered in theUnited States are electively delivered\u2014most for convenience.This impacts short-term neonatal morbidity. New guidelinesare being set by the Joint Commission to decrease electiveinductions of labor prior to 39 weeks' gestation (Institute forHealthcare Improvement, 2010). CRITICAL COMPONENT Elective Induction of Labor It is estimated that 25%-50% of inductions are elective or non-medical. Prior to elective induction, fetal maturity must be con-firmed to be 39 weeks or greater by the following:1.Ultrasound before 20 weeks' gestation confirms gestationalage of 39 weeks or gr eater . 2.Fetal heart tones have been documented as present byDoppler f or 30 weeks. 3.It has been 36 weeks since a positive serum or urine pregnancytest was conrmed. (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. (2009). Induction of Labor ACOGPractice Bulletin, No 107. Washington DC: ACOG.)PATIENT EDUCATION Healthy Mom&Baby, the consumer magazine from the Associationof Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN),launched the \"Go the Full 40\" campaign in early 2012. This educational campaign is designed to help women understand themany reasons it's important for a mom to carry her baby to term.With 40 reasons, Healthy Mom & Baby is busting the myth that it's okay for babies to be born just a little early. In fact, babies need thebenefit of a full-term pregnancy. Inducing labor before 40 weeks isassociated with prematurity, cesarean surgery, hemorrhage, andinfection. Babies born before 37 completed weeks of gestation areat risk for breathing problems, feeding issues, jaundice, low bloodsugar, and problems stabilizing their own body temperature.3704_Ch10_261-290 16/09/13 10:14 AM Page 268CHAPTER 10 High-Risk Labor and Birth 269 is based on research conducted in the 1970s in Dublin, Ireland.However, current evidence supports lower dose infusions(Simpson, 2002), with research reporting more successful vagi-nal births, fewer operative vaginal deliveries, and less tachysys-tole and lower cesarean birth rates. Continued increases in oxytocin rates over a long period during induction can result in oxytocin receptor desensitization or down-regulation, makingoxytocin less effective in producing normal UCs. Indications Post-term pregnancy Pregnancy-induced hypertension Preeclampsia/eclampsia Maternal medical conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus, renaldisease, chronic pulmonary disease, cardiac disease,chronic hypertension) Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) Chorioamnionitis Fetal stress or compromise, such as severe intrauterinegrowth restriction, oligohydramnios, or isoimmunization Fetal demise History of rapid labors/distance from the hospital Psychosocial considerations Contraindications Any contraindications for vaginal birth Previous vertical (classical) uterine scar or prior transfun-dal uterine scar Placental abnormalities such as complete placenta previaor vasoprevia Abnormal fetal position Umbilical cord prolapse Active genital herpes Pelvic abnormalities Risks Associated With Inductions Tachysystole leading to Category II (indeterminate) orCategory III (abnormal) FHR pattern is the primarycomplication of oxytocin in labor (see CriticalComponent: Tachysystole). Side effects of oxytocin use are primarily dose related;tachysystole and subsequent FHR decelerations are com-mon side effects (ACOG, 1999) (see CriticalComponent: Administering Oxytocin in Labor). Water intoxication can occur with high concentrations ofoxytocin with large quantities of hypotonic solutions butusually only with prolonged administration with at least40 mU/min. Assessment Findings The woman understands the indication for induction. Assessment findings and prenatal records reflect an indi-cation for induction. If elective induction, confirmed gestational age of 39 ormore weeks Medical Management Advise of indication for induction of labor and orderinduction of labor as per institutional protocol. Be available to respond to complications.BOX 10-1 PRINCIPLES OF ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF LABOR The original research on active management of labor includedonly nulliparous women in spontaneous, active labor (O'Driscoll,Jackson, & Gallagher, 1970; O'Driscoll, Strange, & Minoque,1973). The following is the summary of their findings:True labor was defined as UCs with either bloody show, sponta- neous rupture of membranes, or 100% cervical effacement. Women received 1:1 labor care from the midwife or nurse.Amniotomy was performed if membranes did not rupture spontaneously once labor was diagnosed. If cervical dilation did not proceed at 1 cm/hour, oxytocin was administered at beginning at 6 mU/min and increasing by 6 mU/min every 15 minutes until adequate labor was established (maximum dose 40 mU/min). The principles of active management have not been shown to decrease the cesarean birth rate in the United States. CRITICAL COMPONENT Tachysystole Tachysystole, previously referred to as hyperstimulation, is excessive uterine activity and is the most concerning side effectof oxytocin because it can result in a progressive adverse effecton fetal status (Simpson & O'Brien-Abel, 2013) ( Fig. 10-3 ). UCs cause an intermittent decrease in blood flow in the inter-villous space where oxygen exchange occurs. The decreasedintervillous blood flow associated with tachysystole leads todecreased oxygen to the fetus. Tachysystole can result in pro-gressive deterioration in fetal status and hypoxemia that resultin an abnormal fetal heart rate. Tachysystole may result inabruptio placenta or uterine rupture, which are rare complica-tions (ACOG, 1999). Tachysystole is defined as: Five or more UCs in 10 minutes over a 30-minute window A series of single UCs lasting 2 minutes or longer UCs occurring within 1 minute of each other Nursing actions for tachysystole with Category I (normal) FHR pattern: Maternal repositioning (left or right lateral) IV fluid bolus of at least 500 mL of lactated Ringer's solution Decrease rate of oxytocin infusion by at least half if noresponse to above measures. Discontinue oxytocin if the pattern persists. Nursing actions for tachysystole with a Category II (indeter- minate) or Category III (abnormal) FHR pattern would alsoinclude (Lyndon & Ali, 2008): Discontinue oxytocin. Maternal repositioning (left or right lateral) IV fluid bolus of at least 500 mL of lactated Ringer's solution Consider O2at 10 L/min by nonrebreather mask. Notify provider of actions taken and maternal fetal response. Consider terbutaline if no response to above measures.3704_Ch10_261-290 16/09/13 10:14 AM Increasing doses when UCs are inadequate; however, thelowest possible dose should be used to achieve laborprogress (Simpson & Atterbury, 2003). Once active labor is established, oxytocin should be discontin-ued to avoid downregulation. Maternal-fetal response to oxytocin is the primary consider-ation. If the frequency, intensity, duration, or resting tone ofthe contraction is increased by oxytocin, this can impedeuterine blood flow and can cause fetal compromise, result-ing in a Category II or Category III FHR pattern. Thus oxy-tocin must be administered with careful monitoring andprompt recognition and interventions for tachysystole toprevent fetal acidosis. Avoid tachysystole because it frequently results in Category II(indeterminate) or Category III (abnormal) fetal heart ratepattern. Continuous EFM is typically used with oxytocin administration. In the absence of risk factors, intermittent auscultation ispermitted with evaluation of FHR and UCs at least every 30 minutes in active labor and every 15 minutes in the second stage. For Category II (indeterminate) or Category III (abnormal)FHR pattern, interventions include the following actions: Discontinue oxytocin. Change maternal position to lateral position. Initiate IV hydration of at least 500 mL lactated Ringer's. Administer O2by nonrebreather mask at 10 L/min. Consider terbutaline if no response Notify the provider and request bedside evaluations forCategory III abnormal FHR.Administering Oxytocin in Labor The goal of oxytocin use in labor is to establish uterine contrac-tion patterns that promote cervical dilation of about 1 cm/hronce in active labor. Generally the UC pattern consists of: 3 UCs in 10 minutes, lasting 40-60 seconds, intensity of 25-75 mm/Hg with IUCP with resting tone 20mm Hg with 1 minute between each UC Oxytocin is administered intravenously and is piggybacked toa mainline IV solution at the port most proximal to the venoussite ( Fig. 10-4 ). Oxytocin is always infused via a pump. There is variation in the concentrations of oxytocin, and itshould be prepared by the pharmacy, as it is a high-alertmedication. Typical concentrations are: 10 units of oxytocin in 1000 mL of lactated Ringer's resultin an infusion rate of 1 mU/min = 6 mL/hr. 20 units of oxytocin in 1000 mL of lactated Ringer's resultin an infusion rate of 1 mU/min = 3 mL/hr. Current dose recommendations are for low-dose oxytocin start-ing at 0.5 mU/min and increasing the dose by 1-2 mU/minevery 30-60 minutes until adequate labor progress is achieved(i.e., effacement or cervical dilation of 0.5-1 cm/hr)and regular UCs every 2-3 minutes lasting seconds. Nursing responsibilities during oxytocin infusion involve care-ful titration of the drug to the maternal and fetal response. The titration process includes decreasing dosage rates ordiscontinuing infusion when UCs are too frequent. Discontinuing oxytocin when FHR is abnormal (Simpson,2013; Simpson & O'Brien-Abel, 2013). Nursing Actions Ensure informed consent has been obtained by providing information about induction, discussing the agents, methods, options, and risks (Gilbert, 2011). Review prenatal record with woman for indication forinduction of labor.Administer low-dose oxytocin starting at 0.5 mU/min(current dose recommendations) and increase the dose by 1-2 mU/min every 30-60 minutes (see Critical Component: Administering Oxytocin inLabor). In the absence of risk factors, evaluate and documentFHR at least every 30 minutes in active labor and every3704_Ch10_261-290 16/09/13 10:14 AM Page 270CHAPTER 10 High-Risk Labor and Birth 271 15 minutes in the second stage via intermittent ausculta-tion or electronic fetal monitoring (EFM). In the presence of risk factors, continuous EFM is recommended and FHR should be evaluated and documented every 15 minutes in active labor and every 5 minutes in the second stage. Monitor strength, frequency, and duration of UCs as anindicator of oxytocin efficacy Q 30 min. Evaluate uterine resting tone by palpation or IUPC pressure below 20 mm Hg to ensure uterine relaxationbetween contractions. Decrease or discontinue oxytocin in the event of uterinetachysystole or indeterminate or abnormal fetal status.The current recommendation when decreasing oxytocinis to lower the dose by half. Assess FHR in response to UCs (see Chapter 9). For Category II (indeterminate) or Category III(abnormal) FHR pattern, interventions include the following actions:Change maternal position to lateral position. IV bolus of at least 500 mL of lactated Ringer's If no response, consider terbutaline Administer O 2by nonrebreather mask at 10 L/min. Discontinue oxytocin. Notify the provider and request a bedside evaluation if theFHR is III. Assess emotional response of patient and support person toinduction of labor. Provide information and reassurance asneeded to alleviate feelings of failure. Assess patient's level of fear and provide information andreassurance. Monitor labor progress with SVE for cervical dilationand fetal descent. Cervical change of 1 cm/hr indicates sufficient progress. Assess the character and amount of amniotic fluid. Assess the character and amount of bloody show. Assess the maternal response, including level of discom-fort and pain and effectiveness of pain management andlabor support Q 30 min. Assess VS per policy, generally Q 2 hr. Assess input and output (I&O) for fluid overload; outputshould mirror intake. Signs and symptoms of fluid over-load include decreased urine output, edema, increasedBP, and pulmonary edema. Ensure adequate hydration, assess I&O Q 8 hr. Greater than 50% of all legal settlements involved perinatal cases, with 40%-50% of these cases related tomanagement of oxytocin (Jonsson, Norden-Lindeberg,& Hanson, 2007). Nurses must minimize the risk ofpatient harm by being well-educated regarding oxytocinrisks as well as being proactive with interventions when there is evidence of tachysystole or abnormalFHR patterns. Follow the constitutions of chain of command if nursingdisagrees with the plan of care (Gilbert, 2011).Oxytocin High Alert Medication Patient injury from drug therapy is the single most com-mon type of adverse event that occurs in the inpatient setting (Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality, 2001;Institute for Healthcare Improvement, 2007). When med-ication errors result in patient injury, there are significantcosts to the patient, health care providers, and institu-tion. Some medications that have a heightened risk ofcausing significant patient harm when they are used inerror are called \"high-alert medications.\" In 2007, theInstitute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) (IV) oxytocin to their list of high-alert med-ications (ISMP, 2007). Special considerations and pre-cautions are required before and during administration ofhigh-alert medications (ISMP, 2007).This is significantfor perinatal care providers because oxytocin is a drugthat they use quite frequently. Errors that involve IV oxy-tocin administration for labor induction or augmentationare most commonly dose related and often involve lack oftimely recognition and appropriate treatment of excessiveuterine activity (i.e., tachysystole) (Clark, Simpson, Knox,& Garite, 2008). Other types of oxytocin errors involvemistaken administration of IV fluids with oxytocin for IVfluid resuscitation during Category II or III fetal heart ratepatterns and/or maternal hypotension and inappropriateelective administration of oxytocin to women who are lessthan 39 completed weeks' gestation. Oxytocin medica-tion errors and subsequent patient harm is generally preventable (Simpson & Knox, 2009). The perinatal teamcan develop strategies to minimize risk of maternal-fetalinjuries related to oxytocin administration consistent with safe care practices used with other high-alert medications. 1.Requirement that women having elective labor inductionbe at least 39 complet ed weeks' gest ation 2.Standard order sets and protocols that reflect a standard-ized clinical ap pr oach to labor induction and augmenta- tion based on current pharmacologic and 3.Standard concentration of oxytocin prepared by thepharmacy 4.Standard definition of uterine tachysystole that does notinclude a Cat egor y III or II (abnormal or indeterminate) FHR pattern (a contraction frequency of more than fivein 10 minutes, a series of single contractions lasting 2minutes or more, contractions of normal durationoccurring within 1 minute of each other) 5.Standard treatment of oxytocin-induced uterinetachy systole guided by fetal status Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

Indications When the woman has little or no cervical effacement When pharmacological methods are contraindicated,such as women with prior uterine incision Risks Associated With Mechanical Cervical Ripening The infection rate is higher. Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) Assessment Findings The cervix is unripe based on SVE and Bishop score. Prenatal record reflects indications for induction. Medical Management The physician or midwife places the mechanical dilators,which usually stay in place for 6-12 hours before beingremoved by the care provider. Figure 10-4 Intravenous oxytocin administration. Cervical Ripening The cervix, composed of connective tissue, is typically closeduntil labor begins. At the onset of labor it undergoes rapidchanges including ripening, effacement, and dilation (Fig. 10-5). Cervical ripening is the process of physical soft-ening and opening of the cervix in preparation for labor andbirth. Because cervical status is the most important predictorof successful induction of labor, cervical status is assessedbefore induction of labor. Typically, cervical status is assessedvia the Bishop score (Table 10-2). A score of 6 or more isconsidered favorable for successful induction of labor. However, when the score is unfavorable (a Bishop score of less than 6), cervical ripening is usually considered. Amechanical or pharmacological cervical ripening agent maybe used. These agents can also sometimes stimulate labor. Mechanical Cervical Ripening Mechanical cervical ripening methods are devices that areinserted through the vagina and into the cervix to dilate thecervix. They are among the oldest methods to initiate labor.More recently, pharmacological prostaglandins 2012). lowerrisk of tachysystole compared to pharmacological methods.Examples of mechanical cervical ripening methods are:Laminaria, lamicil, or dilapanThese materials expand by absorbing fluid from the cervi-cal tissues and cause the cervix to dilate and release localprostaglandin.3704_Ch10_261-290 16/09/13 10:14 AM Page 272CHAPTER 10 High-Risk Labor and Birth 273 Nursing Actions Obtain informed consent following an informative dis-cussion as to the procedure, etc. Prepare the patient and assist with the insertion procedure. Instruct the patient that she might experience discomfortor cramping during insertion. Provide ongoing emotional and informational supportand encourage relaxation. Record the type of dilator and number of dilators or thesize of the balloon placed. Assess onset of UCs. Assess FHR. Assess maternal temperature, as the woman is at higherrisk for infection. Assess for rupture of membranes and vaginal bleeding. Assess maternal and fetal status as per institutional policy. Pharmacological Methods of Cervical Ripening Pharmacological methods of cervical ripening in preparationfor induction of labor may use one of a variety of hormonalpreparations (Table 10-3). These preparations, which areplaced in or near the cervix, produce cervical ripening by caus-ing softening and thinning of the cervix. Occasionally theseagents can stimulate labor contractions. A review of researchon the use of prostaglandins concluded there is an improve-ment in labor stimulation in vaginal birth rates in 24 hours,no increase in operative birth rates, and significant improve-ments in cervical favorability within 24-48 hours when usingprostaglandins (Kelly, Kavanagh, & Thomas, 2003). Indications See indications for induction. Risks Associated With Pharmacological Methods ofCervical Ripening Tachysystole of the uterus (see Critical Component:Uterine Tachysystole) Assessment Findings Unripe cervix based on SVE and Bishop score of 6 or less Prenatal record reflecting indication for inductionMedical Management Determine the need for cervical ripening. Insert the pharmacological agent.Administration of the agent should be done at or near thelabor and birthing unit. Nursing Actions Obtain informed consent. Evaluate the prenatal record for indications and contraindi-cations for induction (see contraindications to augmenta-tion and induction of labor) Document baseline cervical exam and Bishop scorewith SVE. Obtain baseline FHR Monitor FHR and uterine activity as indicated based onmedication and institutional policies. Stripping the Membranes Stripping the membranes is digital separation of the chorionic membrane from the wall of the cervix and loweruterine segment during a vaginal exam done by a primarycare provider to stimulate labor. The exact mechanism ofaction is unclear, but it is commonly believed it releasesprostaglandins and also may cause maternal oxytocinrelease. It is most effective in first-time pregnancies with anunripe cervix. However, there is little scientific evidence ofthe efficacy of stripping the membranes.The procedure is usually done in the care provider'soffice. The care provider is responsible for explaining the proce-dure and its risks. The FHR should be assessed before and after the procedure. The woman might experience some spotting after theprocedure. The woman might experience mild cramping immediatelyafter the procedure. Indications See indications for oxytocin induction.TABLE 10-2 BISHOP SCORE TO ASSESS CERVICAL -1/0 +1/+2 Consistency of cervix Firm Medium Soft Cervical position Posterior Medium Anterior Bishop (1964).3704_Ch10_261-290 16/09/13 10:14 AM Page 273UNIT The ACTIONS Gilbert (2011); Simpson & O'Brien-Abel, 2013.0.5 mg gel is placed below cervical os with speculumexam, can be repeatedevery 6 hours for a maximum of 3 doses Inserted by MD or CNM.

Risks Associated With Stripping of the Membranes Infection Bleeding from undiagnosed placental problem Unplanned rupture of membranes (ROM) Assessment Findings Intact membranes Presenting part engaged Term gestation Medical Management Stripping the membranes is done by the primary careprovider during a SVE by inserting a finger into the cervixand sweeping the finger around the cervix to separate themembrane from the cervix. Amniotomy Amniotomy is the artificial rupture of membranes (AROM) to induce or augment labor with an amnihookduring a SVE (Fig. 10-6). Amniotic fluid release increases the conversion of prostaglandins following theamniotomy. Amniotomy is most typically used to augment or shorten labor but may also be used to induce labor. There is insuffi-cient evidence to support the value of this as a sole interven-tion for induction (Bricker & Luckas, 2000).3704_Ch10_261-290 16/09/13 10:14 AM Page 274CHAPTER 10 High-Risk Labor and Birth 275 This procedure is done by the primary care provider and only if an emergency delivery can be performed nearby (Gilbert, 2011). It is most effective in multiparous women who are dilated to 2 cm or more. Amniotomy in early labor increases the risk of cesarean birth for abnormal FHR. Indications To stimulate labor Contraindications Fetal head not engaged in the maternal pelvis Maternal infection such as HIV and active genital herpes Risks Associated With Amniotomy Severe variable decelerations Bleeding from undiagnosed placental abnormality Umbilical cord prolapse when presenting part is notengaged Intra-amniotic infection increases with duration of therupture. A Cochrane Review of trials noted early interventionwith amniotomy and oxytocin appears to be associatedwith a modest reduction in cesarean births (Wiv, Wo,Xu, Luo, Roy, & Fraiser, 2009). Assessment Findings The woman leaks amniotic fluid vaginally. Medical Management The procedure is done by the primary care provider witha SVE when head is engaged in the pelvis. Nursing Actions Assess the FHR before ROM and immediately followingROM because of the risk of umbilical cord prolapse.Offer comfort and support to the woman, as the proce-dure may be uncomfortable. Assess the color, amount, and odor of amniotic fluid. Monitor UC pattern. Document the time of the AROM. Assess maternal temperature every 4 hours or more frequently if signs and symptoms of infection occur. Administer pericare, as the woman continues to leak fluidafter AROM. Typically nurses do not perform an amniotomy. Theremay be individual institutional policies allowing nurses toperform AROM under specific criteria. Labor Augmentation Wide variations in labor progress and duration occur amongwomen in labor, and there is no consensus among experts as tothe appropriate length of labor. The terms dystocia and failureto progress are sometimes used to characterize an abnormallylong labor. Many providers believe there is benefit to decreas-ing the length of labor through augmentation with oxytocin(Simpson, 2002). The rate of augmentation of labor hasincreased 50% over the last decade, to a current rate of at least18% (Martin et al., 2006). Generally, maternal-fetal status andindividual clinical situations are the basis for labor manage-ment decisions. According to ACOG, contraindications toaugmentation are similar to for labor mayinclude placenta or vasa previa, umbilical cord uterine incision, active genital herpes infection,pelvic structural deformities, or invasive cervical cancer. Labor augmentation is the stimulation of ineffective UCs after the onset of spontaneous labor to manage labor dystocia.All of the principles of oxytocin induction apply to the use ofoxytocin for augmentation of labor. Lower doses of oxytocin are required for augmentation of labor because cervical resistance is lower in women in labor whohave some cervical effacement and dilation. This may not be indi-cated in induction protocols, as some protocols have been influ-enced by research on active management of labor (see Box 10-1). Indications To strengthen and regulate UCs To shorten the length of labor Contraindications Any contraindications for vaginal birth Previous vertical (classical) uterine scar or prior trans-fundal uterine scar Placental abnormalities such as complete placenta previaor vasa previa Abnormal fetal position Umbilical cord prolapse Active genital herpes Pelvic abnormalities Risks Associated With Augmentation Tachysystole leading to a Category II or Category IIIFHR pattern is a primary complication of oxytocin inlabor (see Page 275UNIT 3 The Intrapartal Period 276 Assessment Findings Prolonged labor Inadequate UCs and inadequate labor progress Medical Management Determine the need for labor augmentation. Be available to respond to complications of use of oxy-tocin in labor for augmentation. Nursing Actions Administer low-dose oxytocin starting at 0.5 the UCs are typicallycontinuously monitored, but intermittent monitoring iswithin the standard of care (see Chapter 9). Follow the same principles of nursing care for inductionof labor (see Critical Component: Tachysystole andCritical Component: Administering Oxytocin in Labor). Decrease or discontinue oxytocin in the event of uterinetachysystole or Category II (indeterminate) or Category III(abnormal) fetal heart rate. Complementary Therapies to Stimulate Labor A variety of strategies have been proposed over many decadesto initiate and/or augment labor. For example, acupuncturemay stimulate the uterus. Other practices include bowel stim-ulation with castor oil or an enema to increase prostaglandinproduction. Cochrane reviews of complementary therapiesindicate further research is needed to determine the effective-ness of most therapies to stimulate or induce labor (Kelly,Kavanagh, & Thomas, 2001).Therapies include:Herbal preparationsBlack cohosh Blue cohosh Evening primrose oil Raspberry leaves may be taken orally to promoteprostaglandin or oxytocin production. Sexual intercourse:Semen contains prostaglandin to open the cervix, and orgasmmay be associated with prostaglandin and oxytocin release. OPERATIVE VAGINAL DELIVERY Operative vaginal delivery is a vaginal birth that is assisted by a vacuum extraction or forceps. Since 1996, the rate of cesare-an birth has increased and the percentage of operative vaginaldeliveries with either forceps or vacuum extraction hasdecreased 45% over 10 years, from 9.4% to 4.5% (Martin etal., 2011). Indications for operative vaginal delivery are toimprove maternal or fetal status by shortening the secondstage of labor. Facilitating birth and shortening the secondstage of labor can be performed only by care providers withhospital privileges for these procedures. Although sometimesindicated, operative vaginal birth is not without risk of com-plications to the woman and the fetus. Specific guidelines forthe use of forceps and vacuum extraction are provided, anduse of only one method, either forceps or vacuum, for an indi- vidual patient is recommended. If attempts are unsuccessful,the physician proceeds with a cesarean birth. Vacuum-Assisted Delivery Vacuum-assisted delivery or vacuum extraction is a birth involving the use of a vacuum cup on the fetal head to assistwith delivery of the fetal head (Fig. 10-7). The cup is placedon the fetal head and suction is increased gradually until a sealis formed. Gentle traction is then applied to deliver the fetalhead (Fig. 10-8). The rate of vacuum-assisted delivery, which had increased by 77% between 1989 (3.5%) and 1997 (6.2%), has sincedecreased to 4.5% for 2009 (Martin et al., 2011). Some advan-tages to the use of vacuum over forceps include:Easier application Less anesthesia required Less maternal soft tissue damage Fewer fetal injuriesCurrent guidelines for vacuum application are: The fetal head needs to be engaged and the cervix com-pletely dilated. There should be a maximum of three attempts for a peri-od of 15 minutes: the \"three-pull rule.\" Cup detachment from the fetal head (pops off of the vac-uum) is a warning sign that too much pressure or ineffec-tive force is being exerted on the fetal head. The physician should proceed with a cesarean birth whenvacuum attempts are not successful. Indications Suspicion of immediate or potential fetal compromise Need to shorten the second stage for maternal benefit Prolonged second stageNulliparous woman with lack of continuing progress for 3 hours with regional anesthesia, or for 2 hours withoutanesthesia Figure 10-7 \u00a9 CooperSurgical.3704_Ch10_261-290 16/09/13 10:14 Page 276CHAPTER 10 High-Risk Labor and Birth 277 Multiparous woman with lack of continuous progress for 2 hours with regional anesthesia, or for 1 hour withoutregional anesthesia (ACOG, 2000) Risks for the Woman Vaginal and cervical lacerations Extension of episiotomy Hemorrhage related to uterine atony, uterine rupture Bladder trauma Perineal wound infection Risks for the Newborn Cephalohematoma (15%) and therefore increased risk ofjaundice (Fig. 10-9) and retinal hemorrhage Scalp lacerations or bruising (10%) Assessment Findings Fetus at 36 weeks' gestation and the fetal head is engaged,at least at 0 station in the maternal pelvis (Cunningham,Leveno, Bloom, Hauth, Rouse, & Spong, 2010).Medical Management Explain the procedure and obtain the woman's consent. Place the vacuum appropriately. After three unsuccessful attempts, proceed with acesarean birth. The recommendations of the manufacturer of the vacuumdevice should be followed. Nursing Actions Assess the woman's comfort level. Urinary bladder may be emptied by provider or nurse todecrease risk of trauma. Educate and reassure the woman and her family. Anticipate potential complications for the woman andthe newborn. Pump up the vacuum pump manually to the pressureindicated on the pump, not to exceed 500-600 mm Hg.Cup detachment (pop off) is a warning sign that too muchineffective force is being exerted on fetal head. Pressure should be released between contractions. The vacuum procedure should be timed from insertion ofthe cup into the vagina until the birth, and the cup shouldnot be on the fetal head for longer than 15-20 minutes.Adherence to the guidelines for the vacuum device relatedto pressure and maximum time will minimize the nurse'sliability in vacuum-assisted vaginal births. Forceps-Assisted Delivery Forceps-assisted birth is one in which an instrument is used toassist with delivery of the fetal head, typically done to improvethe health of the woman or the fetus. The rate of forceps deliveryhas decreased over the last 20 years from 5.55% to only 1.0%(Martin et al., 2011). Outlet forceps are used when the head isvisible on the perineum and the skull has reached the pelvic floor,and rotation is less than 45 degrees (Fig. 10-10). Low forceps isused when the skull is at +2 station or lower in the maternalpelvis and not on the pelvic floor and rotation is greater than 45 degrees (ACOG, 2000) (Fig. 10-11). Only outlet and lowforceps are currently recommended for use in assisting delivery. Indications The fetal head engaged and the cervix is completely dilated. There is suspicion of immediate or potential fetal compromise.A B C Used with permission from Cooper-Surgical The Intrapartal Period 278 To shorten the second stage for maternal benefit (e.g.,maternal exhaustion and/or fetal compromise) Prolonged second stageNulliparous woman with lack of continuing progress for 3 hours with regional anesthesia, or for 2 hours withoutanesthesia Multiparous woman with lack of continuous progress for 2 hours with regional anesthesia, or for 1 hour withoutregional anesthesia High level of regional anesthesia that inhibits pushing Maternal cardiac or pulmonary disease that contraindi-cates pushing efforts Risks for the Woman Vaginal and cervical lacerations Extension of episiotomy Hemorrhage related to uterine atony, uterine rupture Perineal hematoma Bladder trauma Perineal wound infection Risks for the Newborn Cephalohematoma Nerve injuries including craniofacial and brachial plexusinjuriesSkin lacerations or bruising Skull fractures Intracranial hemorrhage Assessment Findings The cervix is completely dilated and the membranes areruptured. The fetal head is engaged. The woman has adequate anesthesia. Medical Management Use only on a fetus that is at least 36 weeks' gestation. Explain the procedure and obtain the woman's consent. Place forceps appropriately. Nursing Actions Assess the woman's anesthesia level and comfort level. Insert a straight catheter to empty the bladder to decreasethe risk of bladder trauma and increase room for the fetalhead and forceps. Provide emotional support for the woman and her part-ner, since use of forceps can increase the anxiety level. Document the type of forceps, number of applications,and time of application. Anticipate potential complications for the woman andthe neonate. OPERATIVE BIRTH Cesarean birth is a common operation performed onwomen, with reported rates varying across the world (Fig. 10-12). In developed countries, cesarean birth accounts for 21.3% of births in the United Kingdom; in Australia; 32.9% in the and more than 50% in some private hospitals inChile, Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay (Viswanathan et al.,2006). The cesarean section rate in the United States is 60% higher than the 1996 rate of 20.7%. Based on currentdata, 49.5% of women age 40 or older deliver by cesareansection (Martin et al., 2011). The benefits and harms ofSimpson forceps (outlet)Blade ShankHandle Page 278CHAPTER 10 High-Risk Labor and Birth 279 elective cesarean birth, repeat cesarean birth, and vaginalbirth after cesarean (VBAC) are under vigorous debate.Because cesarean birth accounts for one-third of births inthe United States, Chapter 12 is devoted to care of cesareanwoman and their families. Despite recommendations fromACOG on the safety of this, there has been a decrease in therate of VBAC, which fell from 4% to 1% of all deliveries in2008. At the same time the rate of repeat C-section nearlydoubled. As a result, nearly all childbirths after a previousC-section (91%) were a repeat C-section (Podulka,Stranges, & Steiner, 2011). Vaginal Birth After a Cesarean Vaginal birth after a cesarean (VBAC) is used to describe labor and vaginal birth in a woman who has had a priorcesarean birth. A trial of labor after cesarean or TOLAC offer women an opportunity of achieving a VBAC. Evidencesuggests that benefits of VBAC outweigh risks in womenwith lower uterine transverse cesarean birth who have no con-traindications for a vaginal birth. Benefits of VBAC includeshorter recovery time and overall lower morbidity and mortal-ity, including less blood loss, fewer infections, and fewerthromboembolic problems (ACOG, 2010). AdditionallyACOG notes for those considering larger families, VBACmay avoid potential future maternal consequences of multiplecesarean deliveries such as hysterectomy, bowel or bladderinjury, transfusion, abnormal previa and placenta accreta. According to ACOG, most women with one previous cesarean birth with a low transverse incision are candidates forvaginal birth after cesarean birth and should be counseledabout VBAC and offered a trial of labor (ACOG, 2010).However, VBAC rates have fallen 67% since 1996 (Martin etal., 2006). This is reported to be related to more conservativeACOG practice guidelines, legal pressure, and the continuingdebate over the harms and benefits of vaginal birth comparedwith cesarean birth and an increase in repeat cesarean births.Regardless of the reason for the previous cesarean birth, oncea woman has had a cesarean birth there is a more than 90% chance that subsequent deliveries will be by cesarean(Martin et al., 2006). VBAC is associated with a small butimportant risk of uterine rupture, and that risk increases withthe number of previous cesarean births. Indications One or two prior low transverse cesarean births with noother uterine scars Clinically adequate pelvis Physician and OR team immediately available to performemergent cesarean birth. Contraindications Prior vertical (classical) or T-shaped uterine incision orother uterine surgery (Fig. 10-13) Previous uterine rupture Pelvic abnormalities Medical or obstetric complications that preclude a vaginalbirth Inability to perform an emergent cesarean birth if neces-sary because of insufficient personnel such as surgeons,anesthesia, or facility Risks Associated With VBAC Uterine rupture and complications associated with uterinerupture (1%)Waiting for spontaneous labor and avoiding use ofprostaglandins and oxytocin reduces the risk of uterinerupture. A failed TOLAC is associated with more complicationsthan elective repeat cesarean delivery.Figure 10-12 Family in cesarean birth. Figure 10-13 Vertical uterine incision.3704_Ch10_261-290 16/09/13 10:14 AM Page 279UNIT 3 The Intrapartal Period 280 Uterine rupture or dehiscence is the outcome associatedwith TOLAC that most significantly increases thechance of additional maternal and neonatal morbidity. Neonatal morbidity is higher in the setting of a failedTOLAC than in a vaginal birth after cesarean delivery(VBAC). Assessment Findings Records confirm prior transverse uterine scar. Medical Management Explain the risks and benefits of VBAC. Induction of labor for maternal or fetal indicationsremains an option in women undergoing TOLAC. Use of misoprostol for cervical ripening is contraindicated. The physician and surgical team must be available to per-form a cesarean birth if necessary. Nursing Actions Review the prenatal record for documentation of prioruterine scar because VBAC is contraindicated in verticaluterine incisions. Monitor closely and continuously uterine activity and FHR. Assess the progress of labor. Provide information, reassurance, and support to thewoman. Report any complaints of severe pain and be alert to signsof uterine rupture such as vaginal bleeding and ascendingstation of fetal presenting part. POST-TERM PREGNANCY Apost-term pregnancy or prolonged pregnancy is one that has a gestational period of 42 completed weeks or more from thefirst day of the last menses (if the menstrual cycle is 28 days).The actual cause of post-term pregnancy is unclear; the etiologyand pathophysiology are not completely understood (Gilbert,2007). For 5%-10% of pregnant women, their pregnanciescontinue beyond 294 days (42 completed weeks) and aredescribed as being \"post-term\" or \"postdate\" (Cunningham etal., 2010). Postmaturity refers to the abnormal condition of thenewborn resulting from prolonged pregnancy. Both the womanand infant are at increased risk of adverse events when the preg-nancy continues beyond term. After 41 weeks, neonatal andpostneonatal death risk increase significantly (G\u00fclmezoglu,Crowther, & Middleton, 2006). Obstetric problems associated with post-term pregnancy include:Induction of labor with an unfavorable cervix Cesarean birth Prolonged labor Postpartum hemorrhage Traumatic birthIt is likely that some of these unwanted outcomes result from intervening when the uterus and cervix are not ready for labor.First-trimester pregnancy ultrasound is associated with a reduced incidence of post-term pregnancy, possibly by avoid-ing incorrect dating and misclassification of postdates.Induction of labor is widely practiced to try to prevent the problems mentioned above and to improve the healthoutcome for women and their infants.Labor induction may itself cause problems, especiallywhen the cervix is not ripe. The ideal timing for induction of labor is not clear. Inthe past, there was a tendency to await spontaneous laboruntil 42 completed weeks. Current practice is to offer induction of labor between 41 and 42 weeks.The gestational age and the cervix being unfavorable (unripe) may affect the success of the induction of labor andresult in an increase in cesarean birth rates.When the cervix is favorable (usually a Bishop score of 6 or more), induction is often carried out via oxytocinand AROM. If the cervix is not favorable, usually a prostaglandin gelor tablet is placed in the vagina or cervix to ripen thecervix and to initiate the UCs and labor. Many protocolsare used with varying repeat intervals and transition tooxytocin and amniotomy depending on the onset of UCsand progress of cervical dilation. Risks Associated With Post-Term Pregnancy Prolonged pregnancy results in a decrease in amnioticfluid volume and may impact fetal status because amnioticfluid cushions the fetus and cord from pressure and injuryand amniotic fluid volume is an indicator of placentalfunction. As the placenta begins to age, there are increased areas ofinfarction and deposition of calcium and fibrin within itstissue. This creates decreased placental reserve (Fig. 10-14). placenta in placenta.3704_Ch10_261-290 16/09/13 10:14 AM Page 280CHAPTER 10 High-Risk Labor and Birth 281 Meconium-stained fluid occurs in 25%-30% of post-termpregnancies. This creates an increased risk for meconiumaspiration of the neonate at birth (Cunningham et al.,2010). There is an increased risk of fetal macrosomia as the fetusincreases in size approximately 1 ounce per day after term. Assessment Findings Category II or III FHR related to decreased amnioticfluid and uteroplacental insufficiency with aging placenta Meconium-stained fluid Women report increased anxiety and frustration withprolonged pregnancy Fetal macrosomia Medical Management Antenatal surveillance Induction of labor offered at 41 weeks of gestation Nursing Actions Review the plan of care with the woman. Confirm prolonged pregnancy on the prenatal record. Anticipate management with induction of labor and possible cervical ripening agents. Monitor FHR because of increased incidence of utero-placental insufficiency. Assess amniotic fluid for amount and meconium stainingwith (see Concept Map for post-term pregnancyand labor induction). OBSTETRICAL EMERGENCIES Obstetrical emergencies are urgent clinical situations that place either the maternal or fetal status at risk for increasedmorbidity and mortality. Intrapartum emergencies may berelated to one or more maternal, fetal, uterine, cord, and/orplacental factors. The physiological effects of intrapartumemergencies on the woman and fetus may create rapid deteri-oration in oxygenation and perfusion. Intrapartum emergen-cies may place the woman and fetus at risk of exceeding theiroxygen and perfusion reserves (Curran, 2003). Interventionsare directed to stabilization of maternal status, which in turnstabilizes fetal status. Shoulder Dystocia Shoulder dystocia refers to difficulty encountered during delivery of the shoulders after the birth of the head. The ante-rior shoulder or more rarely both shoulders become impactedabove the pelvic rim. The first sign is a retraction of the fetalhead against the maternal perineum after delivery of the head,sometimes referred to as turtle sign. This impaction of the fetal shoulders may lead to a prolonged delivery time of morethan 60 seconds. Shoulder dystocia is an unpreventable andunpredictable obstetrical emergency that can result in seriousfetal morbidity and even mortality if not recognized and successfully managed.Neonatal morbidity includes: Brachial plexus injuries Clavicle fracture Neurological injury Asphyxia DeathReduction in the interval of time from delivery of the head to the body is crucial to fetal outcome. Most experts note thatmore than a 5-minute delay in head to body interval may resultin fetal hypoxemia and acidosis. It is estimated that a newborncan survive for approximately 6 minutes before irreversiblebrain and organ damage occurs. The incidence of shoulderdystocia ranges from reports of 0.6%-1.4% (ACOG, 2002).Most cases of shoulder dystocia cannot be accurately predictedor prevented (Cunningham et al., 2010). Additionally, there is no clear evidence to support the use of prophylactic maneu-vers to prevent shoulder dystocia (Atukorala, Middleton, &Crouther, Associated With Shoulder Dystocia Fetal macrosomia (wt >4,500 grams) Maternal diabetes History of shoulder dystocia Prolonged second stage Excessive weight gain Risks Associated With Shoulder Dystocia Delay in delivery of the shoulders results in compressionof the fetal neck by the maternal pelvis, which impairsfetal circulation and results in possible increased intracra-nial pressure, anoxia, asphyxia, and brain damage. Brachial plexus injury and clavicle fracture in the neonatecan also occur. Maternal complications include lacerations, infection,bladder injury, or postpartum hemorrhage. Assessment Findings The first sign is a retraction of the fetal head against thematernal perineum after delivery of the head, sometimesreferred to as turtle sign. Delay in delivery of shoulders after delivery of head Medical Management Downward traction may be applied to the fetal head withsuprapubic pressure. Extend the midline episiotomy to obtain room formaneuvers. The McRoberts maneuver is a reasonable initialapproach. The Woods corkscrew maneuver progressively rotates theposterior shoulder 180 degrees to disimpact the anteriorshoulder. Deliver the posterior shoulder by sweeping the posteriorarm across the fetus's chest followed by delivery of the arm.3704_Ch10_261-290 16/09/13 10:14 AM Page 281UNIT 3 The Intrapartal Period 282 Most shoulder dystocias are resolved by using the abovemaneuvers. The Zavanelli maneuver is cephalic replacement into thepelvis and then cesarean delivery, for catastrophic casesonly (ACOG, 2002). Planned cesarean birth to prevent shoulder dystocia maybe considered for suspected fetal macrosomia with anestimated fetal weight exceeding 5,000 grams in womenwithout diabetes and 4,500 grams in women with diabetes (ACOG, 2002). Nursing Actions Explain the situation to the woman and the family andexplain the interventions to resolve dystocia and impor-tance of woman's assistance with maneuvers. Request assistance, as additional nurses may be needed toimplement maneuvers to resolve dystocia. Insert a straight catheter into the woman to empty thebladder if it is distended to make more room for the fetus. A variety of techniques may be used to free the impacted shoulder from beneath the symphysis pubis(Camune & Bracher, 2007); pressure can be appliedabove bone or laterally to the pubic bone todislodge the anterior shoulder and push it beneath thesymphysis (Fig. 10-15A). The mother should not push except when instructed toand only when it is believed the shoulder has beenreleased. The McRoberts maneuver consists of sharply flexing thethigh onto the maternal abdomen to straighten thesacrum (Fig. 10-15B). Use of fundal pressure is controversial and not indicatedin shoulder dystocia. Notify the neonatal team. Prepare for neonatal resuscitation. Document the series of interventions and clinical eventswith time intervals (Simpson & O'Brien-Abel, 2013). Prolapse of the Umbilical Cord Prolapse of the umbilical cord is when the cord lies below thepresenting part of the fetus (Fig. 10-16). The cord may pro-lapse in front of the presenting part, into the vagina, orthrough the introitus. Occult prolapse is when the cord is pal-pated through the membranes but does not drop into thevagina. When cord prolapse occurs, it is typically withAROM or SROM when the presenting part is not engagedin the pelvis. The cord becomes entrapped against the pre-senting part and circulation is occluded, resulting in FHRbradycardia. A loop of cord may be palpated or visualized inthe vagina. An emergency cesarean birth is typically done toimprove neonatal outcomes with a prolapsed cord. Risk Factors for Prolapse of the Umbilical Cord Malpresentation of the fetus (such as breech) Unengaged presenting partPolyhydramnios Small or preterm fetus Multiple gestation High parity Risks Associated With Prolapse of the UmbilicalCord Total or partial occlusion of the cord, resulting in rapid deterioration in fetal perfusion and oxygenation(Curran, 2003) Assessment Findings Sudden fetal bradycardia (i.e., prolonged decelerations) Prolapsed umbilical cord that may be felt with a SVE orvisualized in or protruding from the vagina Medical Management Vaginal birth or operative vaginal delivery may beattempted if birth is imminent. Perform emergency cesarean section.Figure 10-15 McRoberts maneuver and subrapubic pres- sure. When fetal shoulders become impacted under thematernal symphis pubis, the nurse should initiate McRobertsmaneuver by hyperextending woman's legs ontoher abdomen and simultaneously providing suprapubic pres-sure to assist the fetus in adducting the arms closer to thebody in an attempt to release the impacted shoulders. 3704_Ch10_261-290 16/09/13 10:14 AM Page 282CHAPTER 10 High-Risk Labor and Birth 283 Nursing Actions Occlusion of the cord may be partially relieved by lifting the presenting part off the cord with a vaginal exam. Theexaminer's hand remains in the vagina, lifting the present-ing part off the cord until delivery by cesarean (Fig. 10-17). Request assistance and notify the medical provider. Explain the situation to the woman and family and thatinterventions are necessary to expedite delivery. Explain to the woman the importance of her assistance. Recommend position changes such a knee-chest positionor Trendelenburg to try to relieve pressure on the occludedcord (Fig. 10-18). Administer O 2at 10 L/min by mask. Give IV fluid hydration bolus. Discontinue oxytocin. Administer a tocolytic agent to decrease uterine activity. Move toward emergency delivery. If birth is imminent,the provider may proceed with vaginal delivery. If birth isnot imminent, anticipate and prepare for emergencycesarean section.the cord into the membranes rather than the placenta or fromvessels running between lobes of the placenta with one ormore accessory lobes (Fig. 10-19). If perinatal mortality of 60% (Oyelese, 2004).Pressure on unprotected vessels by the presenting part canlead to fetal asphyxia and death. Ruptured vasa previa refers to when the fetal vessels running through the membranes,over the cervix, that are unprotected rupture (Oyelese &Smulian, 2007). Rupture of membranes frequently leads torapid fetal exsanguination (Cunningham et al., 2010). Risk Factors for Vasa Previa Low lining placenta Placenta previa Pregnancies in which the placenta has accessory lobes Multiple gestation Pregnancies resulting from IVF Risks Associated With Vasa Previa Fetal asphyxia from cord compression Fetal death from exsanguination Assessment Findings Vasa previa is most commonly diagnosed when rupture ofthe membranes is accompanied by vaginal bleeding orfetal distress or death.

Planned cesarean birth at 35 weeksimproves neonatal survival to 95% (Oyelese & Smulian,2007). When acute bleeding occurs, emergent delivery is indi-cated. Usually cesarean birth is indicated.Nursing Actions If a woman is diagnosed by ultrasound during pregnancy,she may be admitted to the hospital for surveillance, corticosteroids to promote lung maturity, and a plannedcesarean birth at 35 weeks. Nursing care related to ante-natal hospitalization for high-risk pregnancy is detailed in Chapter 7. If bleeding is observed upon examination by the nurse,an immediate bedside evaluation by the provider is indicated. Rupture of the Uterus Rupture of the uterus is a partial or complete tear in the uter- ine muscle.In complete uterine rupture, all of the layers of the uterine wall are separated. In incomplete uterine rupture (uterine dehiscence), the uterine muscle is separated but the visceral peritoneum is intact.Signs and symptoms of uterine rupture are related to inter- nal hemorrhage and reflected in both the maternal and fetalstatus, in relationship to the extent of the rupture.The condition usually becomes evident because of signsof fetal compromise and maternal hypovolemia related tohemorrhage. If the fetal presenting part is in the pelvis, loss of stationmay occur, which is detected with a vaginal exam.Maternal and fetal survival depends on prompt identifica- tion and surgical intervention.Fetal mortality with uterine rupture is reported at 50%-70%. Maternal mortality is 5%. Risks Associated With Rupture of the Uterus The greatest risk factor is previous cesarean section withTOLAC 0.5-0.9% (ACOG, 2010) (Cunningham et al.,2010); others are previous vertical uterine scar, multifetalgestation, and uterine tachysystole. Potential effects on woman and fetus include hypovolemicshock, infection, hypoxemia, acidosis, neurological damage,and possible death. Maternal complications are primarily due to hypovolemiaas a result of hemorrhage. Complications to the fetus may be due to uteroplacentalinsufficiency, placental abruption, cord compression,asphyxia, and/or hypovolemia. Assessment Findings Maternal assessment findings may include signs andsymptoms of hypovolemic shock, such as:Hypotension Tachypnea Tachycardia Pallor Severe sensation, burning \"stabbing\" pain, andcontractionsChorionic platePlacenta Uterus Placenta succenturi ata Marginal insertion the cord Velamentous insertion of the cord Figure 10-19 A. Normal insertion of umbilical cord into chorionic plate. Normally the umbilical cord inserts nearthe center of the chorionic plate, which stabilizes the fetalvessels as they leave the umbilical cord. Like the roots of atree, the fetal vessels branch over the surface of the chori-onic plate and then dive into the placental parenchyma. B. Illustration depicting abnormalities of umbilical cordinsertion into the placenta. With a velamentous insertionof the umbilical cord into the membranes or with a suc-centuriate lobe, fetal vessels, within the chorionic mem-branes and unprotected by the placenta, may courseacross the cervix and result in a vasa previa.

Ascending station of the fetal presenting part Medical Management Perform emergency cesarean birth.Control maternal hemorrhage. Hysterectomy may be necessary. Transfusions may be needed. Nursing Actions Request assistance and notify the medical provider. Stabilize the woman with O2and IV fluids and blood products. Prepare for emergency cesarean birth. Explain the situation to the woman and her family thatinterventions that will expedite delivery, and the impor-tance of their assistance. Anaphylactic Syndrome (also known as Amniotic Fluid Embolism) Anaphylactic Syndrome is a rare but often fatal complication that occurs during pregnancy, labor, and birth, or the first 24 hours post-birth. An embolism forms when the amnioticfluid that contains fetal cells, lanugo, and vernix enters thematernal vascular system and results in cardio respiratory collapse. This is discussed more completely in Chapter 14. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a syn- drome that occurs when the body is breaking down bloodclots faster than it can form a clot. This quickly depletes thebody of clotting factors, leads to hemorrhage, and can rapidlylead to maternal death. Women who experience DIC aretransferred to the critical care unit and a perinatologistmanages the care. This is discussed more completely inChapter 14. Critical Care in Perinatal Nursing Critical care intrapartum nursing may be required when awoman has a preexisting condition or a maternal or fetal com-plication develops during pregnancy. The ability of a hospitalto deliver this high level of care may vary; because high-risk andcritically ill women may be encountered in any setting, all intra-partum nurses should be prepared to identify and participate instabilizing critically ill women for transport to a tertiary carecenter or intensive care unit (AWHONN, 2008). Intrapartumnurses who care for critically ill women receive additional education and undergo didactic and verification of learning andclinical skills beyond the scope of this chapter. Most criticallyill pregnant women are cared for in adult intensive care units or in specialized obstetric critical care units. No matter wherethe care is delivered, a comprehensive plan of care shouldaddress the unique physiologic needs of the pregnant woman.Therefore, it is essential that when indicated, critical care andperinatal nurses collaborate to coordinate care for this uniquepopulation. Women who have any of the disorders or diseasespresented in the high-risk didactic content have the potentialto become critically ill if their condition deteriorates. OBSTETRIC COMPLICATIONS Pregnancy-Related Complications in Labor Most pregnancy-related complications have the potential toimpact labor. For example, diabetic women in labor needcontinuous monitoring of glucose, in particular becausehyperglycemia impacts placental perfusion. Another exampleis preeclampsia, where of preeclampsia also diminishes perfusion and impactsboth maternal and fetal outcomes. Rather than repeat all theinformation from Chapter 7 on complications during preg-nancy, we are referring you to that chapter for managementand care of patients with these disorders. Pregestational Complications Impacting Intrapartal Period Labor complicated by cardiovascular disease is potentiallydangerous to maternal and fetal outcomes. Marked hemody-namic changes in labor have a profound effect on the womenin labor, placental perfusion, and fetal status. Extensive dis-cussion of specific pregestational complications and theirmanagement in labor is beyond the scope of this text. Pleaserefer to Chapter 7 for additional information on managementof pregestational complications. Multiple Gestation Delivery The patient with a multiple gestation pregnancy is at higher risk for many complications during the intrapartum period,which include preterm birth, preeclampsia, and hemorrhage.With the mean gestational age of delivery being 35 weeks fortwins, 32 weeks for triplets, and 29 weeks for quadruplets,preparing for the delivery of multiples is not only high risk butcomplex (Gilbert, 2011). Decisions on method of delivery aredependent on a number of factors, including: number of fetuses,position of presentation of fetuses, and in particular the present-ing fetus (twin A) and fetal weight. If the first twin is vertexpresentation, vaginal delivery may be attempted. It is commonnow for women to be delivered by cesarean birth with twins.High order multiple gestations are typically delivered by cesare-an birth (Cunningham et al., 2010). See Chapter 7 for more onmultiple gestation pregnancy and Chapter 9 for fetal monitor-ing with multiples. Delivery of Intrauterine Fetal Demise Intrauterine fetal demise is the death of the fetus in utero.Further discussion of the care of families experiencing anintrauterine fetal demise can be found related to postpartumnursing care in Chapter 17.3704_Ch10_261-290 16/09/13 10:14 AM Page 285UNIT 3 The Intrapartal Period 286 Causes Often unexplained Severe medical maternal complications with diabetes, renaldisease, cardiovascular disease, connective tissue diseaseand autoimmune disease Placental abruption Labor with fetus less then 24 weeks of gestation Malnutrition Maternal trauma Post-term pregnancy (more then 2 weeks beyond theestimated date of delivery) Cord accidents Extreme prematurity Congenital or genetic abnormalities making the fetusincompatible with life Risks Associated With Intrauterine Fetal DemisePregnancy Prolonged retention of the dead fetus may lead to thedevelopment of disseminated intravascular coagulation(DIC) in the mother and puts the mother at higher riskfor infection, which can result in sepsis or endometritis. Assessment Findings Decreased or absent fetal movement for several hoursor moreIntrauterine Fetal Death (IUFD) is confirmed by visuali-zation of the fetal heart with absence of heart action onultrasound. Medical Management Induction of labor within 24-48 hours of confirmeddiagnosis Stillborn delivery Nursing Actions Provide anticipatory guidance in slow, small increments Talk to patient and family directly. Give simple explanations. Allow the patient to grieve. Provide comforting touch to the patient. Continuity of care; prevent unnecessary moves from laborroom to delivery room to recovery room. Allow unlimited time with infant after delivery. Provide the patient and family with mementos; babyclothing, photos of baby with family and patient, measur-ing tape, baby comb, blanket, footprints, and handprints.

She is a 42-year-old, single, African-American attor-ney whom you admitted yesterday at 32 weeks' gestation with thediagnosis of preterm labor. She was treated with magnesium sul-fate and Betamethasone. Tonight when you came on your shift at7 P.M. she remained on magnesium sulfate but was contractingregularly and at 3:20 A.M. had SROM for clear fluid. At 4:00 A.M.her cervix was 5 cm/90%/+1. At that time the magnesium sulfatewas discontinued and normal spontaneous vaginal birth is antici-pated because of advanced preterm labor. Over the next hourMallory is contracting every 2-3 minutes and is coping well withuterine contractions. Her sister, Allison, is at the bedside providinglabor support. The FHR baseline is 140s, with average variability,occasional accelerations, and no FHR decelerations. At 5:15 A.M.,Mallory feels the urge to have a bowel movement and you do anSVE. Her vaginal exam reveals that she is 10 cm/100%/+1.Who needs to be notified of your significant assessment findings?What would you report? Within 15 minutes of your report, her physician arrives, con- firms your assessment that Mallory is completely dilated, andwants her to start to push. You coach Mallory to begin pushingwith her next contraction.What are your priorities in nursing care for Mallory?Discuss the rationale for the priorities.State nursing diagnosis, expected outcome, and interventions related to this problem. What would you anticipate as Mallory's teaching needs? Over the next hour, Mallory's contractions slow to every 7 minutes and she is pushing with open glottis pushing andfeels the urge to bear down with the peak of contractions. Asterile vaginal exam reveals that she is completely dilated anddescent of the fetal head is +2 station. You request the physi-cian to come to the bedside to evaluate fetal descent. After herphysician evaluates Mallory, she requests oxytocin augmenta-tion to increase the frequency of her contractions. You initiateoxytocin augmentation at 1 mU/min per physician orders.Discuss the risk associated with oxytocin augmentation.Outline nursing actions when caring for a patient with oxytocin augmentation.What teaching would you include related to oxytocin augmentation? Within 30 minutes of starting the oxytocin, Mallory is hav- ing UCs every 1-2 minutes lasting 45 to 55 seconds moderateto palpation with a relaxed uterus between contractions. TheFHR baseline is in the 140s with variable decelerations to 90sfor 40 seconds with UCs, and FHR variability is moderate.What are your priorities in nursing care?Discuss the rationale for the priorities and nursing actions.What are your nursing actions based on your assessment?State nursing diagnosis, expected outcomes. Over the next hour, Mallory's contractions are every 3-4 minutes and she is pushing with contractions and has a strongurge to bear down with contractions. The FHR is 140s withmoderate variability and variable decelerations to 100 bpm for30 seconds with contractions and open glottis pushing.

INTRODUCTION Cesarean birth, also referred to as cesarean section, C-section (C/S), or surgical birth, is an operative procedure in which thefetus is delivered through an incision in the abdominal walland the uterus. A cesarean birth is major abdominal surgery.Approximately one-third of pregnant couples experience acesarean birth. The percentage of cesarean births hasincreased from 20.7% in 1996 to 32.9% in 2009 and reflects a60% increase over a 13-year period (Hamilton, Martin, &Ventura, 2010; Martin, Hamilton, Sutton, &Ventura, 2011).Rates have continued to increase for mothers in all age groupsand among all ethnicities and races, but in particular for olderwomen (Hamilton et al., 2010). This increase in cesareanbirth rate is partially attributed to:A decrease in vaginal birth after cesarean section (VBAC)rates from 30.1 per 100 live births of women with previ-ous cesarean section in 1996 to 8.5 in 2006 (ACOG,2010). VBACs are discussed further in Chapter 10. The incidence of vacuum and forceps deliveries hasdecreased. Most fetuses presenting as breech are now delivered bycesarean. An increase in the number of cesarean deliveries onmaternal request (CDMR). CDMR is a cesarean section that is performed at the request of the woman before the 291Don't have time to read this chapter? Want to reinforce your reading?

Rates of labor induction continue to rise, and inducedlabor increases the risk of cesarean birth. Average maternal age is rising, and older women, inparticular nulliparous, are at risk for cesarean birth.Current statistics indicate nearly half of cesarean births,49.5%, were credited to women 40 or older. However,rates have continued to increase for mothers in all agegroups and among all ethnicities and races (Hamilton et al., 2010). Malpractice litigation continued to be perceived as con-tributing to the cesarean rate (Cunningham et al., 2010).The needs and experiences of cesarean birth couples are distinctly different from those of couples who experience avaginal birth. These differences include:Increased length of hospitalization Longer period of physical recovery Increased pain Increased negative emotional responses to the childbirthexperienceAdditionally, the experiences are also different for couples who experience a planned cesarean birth versus an unplannedcesarean birth. Women who experience an unplanned cesareanbirth may experience feelings of guilt and failure for not beingable to achieve a vaginal birth. Reports of these feelings havedecreased as the rates of cesarean births have increased andcesarean births have become more common. INDICATIONS FOR CESAREAN BIRTH As shown in Box 11-1, repeat cesarean birth and those per-formed for dystocia are the leading causes in the UnitedStates. The major maternal medical indications for a cesareanbirth are:Previous cesarean birth Placental abnormalities Dystocia, difficult childbirth, or dysfunctional labor thatis caused by:Ineffective uterine contractions that lead to prolonged firststage of labor Cephalopelvic disproportion Cephalopelvic disproportion occurs when ineffective uterine contractions lead to prolonged first stage of labor, or it occurs when the size, shape, or position of the fetal head prevents it from passingthrough the maternal pelvis or when the maternal bony pelvis isnot large enough or appropriately shaped to allow for fetal descent.Previous uterine surgerySurgeries that involved an incision through the myometriumof the uterus Maternal failure to progress through labor (Berghella,2011b; Menacker & Hamilton, 2010) termed failure toprogress or dystocia.Evidence-Based Practice: Cesarean Delivery on Maternal Request National Institutes of Health. (2006). NIH State-of-the-Science Conference:Cesarean Delivery on Maternal Request. Responding to the increased rates of cesarean delivery onmaternal request (CDMR), NIH conducted a systematic litera-ture review and a conference focusing on the risks and benefitsof CDMR. The panel reached the following conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to fully evaluate the benefitsand risks of CDMR as compared to planned vaginal delivery;more research is needed. Until quality evidence becomes available, any decision to per-form a CDMR should be carefully individualized and consis-tent with ethical principles. Given the risk of placenta previa, placenta accreta, andgravid hysterectomy rise with each cesarean CDMRis not recommended for women desiring several children. CDMR should not be performed prior to 39 weeks of gesta-tion or without verification of lung maturity, because of thesignificant danger of neonatal respiratory complications(ACOG, 2007). CDMR should not be motivated by the unavailability ofeffective pain management. Although some physicians have shifted their perception of CDMR risks and benefits since these conclusions were pub-lished, their practice patterns have not changed significantly,fearing risks of malpractice suits (Coleman-Cowger, Croswell,Erikson, Portnoy, Schulkin, & Spong, 2010). Women may per-ceive elective cesarean births as a way to control their birthexperience, but may not be fully aware of negative short- andlong-term implications. Educating women about informedconsent requires providers to discuss the risks and benefits aswell as the possible short- and long-term effects of a surgicalbirth. ACOG recently published a committee opinion that may help to reduce this trend. They state that given the balance ofrisks and benefits in the absence of maternal or fetal indica-tions for cesarean delivery a plan for vaginal delivery is safe andappropriate. CDMR is particularly not recommended for womendesiring multiple children because of increased risk (ACOG,2013). National Institutes of Health. (2006).

The leading driver ofboth the rise and variation is first-birth cesarean deliveriesperformed during labor. Additionally with the large increasein primary cesarean deliveries, repeat cesarean delivery nowhas emerged as the largest single indication. The economiccosts, health risks, and negligible benefits for most mothersand newborns of these higher rates highlight the need for aquality improvement multi-strategy approach, including clin-ical improvement strategies with careful examination of labormanagement practices; payment reform to eliminate negativeor perverse incentives; education to recognize the value ofvaginal birth; and full transparency through public reportingand continued public engagement (Main, Morton, Melsop,Hopkins, Giuliani, & Gould, 2012). Other key points identified to assist with reduction in cesarean delivery rates include that labor induction should beperformed primarily for medical indication; if done for non-medical indications, the gestational age should be at least 39weeks or more and the cervix should be favorable, especiallyin the nulliparous patient. Review of the current literaturedemonstrates the importance of adhering to appropriate def-initions for failed induction and arrest of labor progress. Thediagnosis of \"failed induction\" should only be made after anadequate attempt. Adequate time for normal latent and activephases of the first stage, and for the second stage, should beallowed as long as the maternal and fetal conditions permit.The adequate time for each of these stages appears to belonger than traditionally estimated. Operative vaginal deliveryis an acceptable birth method when indicated and can safelyprevent cesarean delivery (Spong, Berghella, Wenstrom,Mercer, & Saade, 2012). Main and colleagues concluded that national attention to the problem of unnecessary cesarean deliveries is needed as apublic health concern in the search for value and quality inU.S. health care. It is currently believed that there is no evi-dence to demonstrate that a 33% cesarean delivery rate is beneficial to women or their infants. Rather, this rate exposeswomen and infants to unnecessary risks in the perinatal period and long term and results in considerable unnecessaryhealth-care costs. CLASSIFICATION OF CESAREAN BIRTHS Cesarean births are classified into two major groupings ofscheduled (planned) and unscheduled (unplanned).Scheduled cesarean births occur before the onset oflabor. Common reasons for a scheduled cesarean birth are:Previous cesarean birth Maternal or fetal health conditions that place the womanor fetus at risk during labor and/or vaginal birth Malpresentation, such as breech presentation, diagnosedbefore labor Cesarean delivery on maternal request (CDMR) Unscheduled cesarean births are divided into emergent,urgent, and non-urgent.Emergent cesarean birth indicates an immediate need to deliver the fetus (e.g., prolapse of umbilical cord or ruptureof uterus). Urgent cesarean birth indicates a need for rapid delivery of the fetus such as with malpresentation diagnosed afterlabor has begun or placenta previa with mild bleeding andfetal heart rate with normal Category I FHR. Non-urgent cesarean birth indicates a need for cesarean birth related to such complications as failure to progress(cervix does not fully dilate) and failure to descend (fetusdoes not descend through the pelvis) with normal CategoryI FHR. RISKS RELATED TO CESAREAN BIRTH Maternal deaths in the United States related to cesarean birthhave decreased due to improved surgical techniques, anes-thetic care, and the availability of blood transfusions andantibiotic therapy but still pose a risk to both the woman andher fetus. However, women who experience a cesarean birthare at higher risk for postpartum infection, hemorrhage, andthromboembolic disease and maternal death (Hacker, Moore,& Gambone, 2004). Neonates are at higher risk for respiratorymorbidity (Chestnut, 2006). One cohort study of cases found the risk of postpartum death to be 3.6 times higher after cesarean delivery than aftervaginal delivery (Deneux-Tharaux, Carmona, Bouvier-Colle,& Breart, 2006). The causes of death after cesarean births in this study included venous thromboembolism (VTE),amniotic fluid embolus, puerperal infections, Rates of re-hospitalization are higher andcosts associated with cesarean births are often double thoseof vaginal births. 3704_Ch11_291-308 16/09/13 10:15 AM Page 293UNIT 3 The Intrapartal Period 294 RISKS RELATED TO REPEAT CESAREAN BIRTH The most significant long-term complication of repeat surgicalbirth is placenta accreta (Hull accrete includes:Accreta: the placenta does not penetrate the entire thickness of the uterine muscle. Increta: the placenta extends further into the myometrium. Percreta: the placenta extends fully through the uterinewall and may attach to other internal organs, such as theintestine or bladder.In all forms of placenta accreta, the placenta does not separate from the uterine wall after delivery, potentiallyleading to excessive hemorrhage, disseminated intravascularcoagulopathy, organ failure, and, in severe cases, death (Silver,2010). Typically, a hysterectomy is needed to control a massivehemorrhage. PERIOPERATIVE CARE Perioperative perinatal nursing incorporates the skills of thespecialties of obstetrics, surgery, and post-anesthesia care toprovide safe and comprehensive care to promote safe andcomprehensive care to women who have a cesarean birth(Simpson & O'Brien-Abel, 2013). It is common in the United States for cesarean births to be performed in an OR in the obstetrics department andfor labor and delivery nurses to care for the family throughoutthe perioperative experience. Preoperative care may varysomewhat based on the urgency of the cesarean birth. Scheduled Cesarean Birth Couples are admitted to the labor and birthing unit the day ofsurgery (Fig. 11-1). Diagnostic laboratory work, such as com-plete blood count (CBC), platelet count, urinalysis, blood type,and cross match may be completed a few days before admission. Medical Management Explain the reason for the cesarean birth and what it involvesprior to hospital admission and obtain surgical consent. Schedule the surgery. Order presurgery diagnostic laboratory tests, such asCBC, blood type, and Rh. Send the prenatal record and orders to the birthing unitto be placed in the woman's hospital chart. Provide education about the woman's current medications. Identify which medications should be taken or eliminated on the day of surgery. Skin Preparation Encourage women to take at least one preoperative shower using an antiseptic agent on the night prior to the scheduled procedure. Anesthesia Management The anesthesiologist or certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) meets with the couple during the admission process and before the woman is transferred to the operating room. The anesthesiologist or CRNA reviews the prenatal record. The anesthesiologist or CRNA completes an anesthesiahistory and physical, discusses anesthesia options with thecouple, and answers their questions regarding anesthesiaand the procedure. The anesthesiologist or CRNA determines, based on thewoman's history, physical, and clinical signs, if a plateletcount is required before administration of epidural or spinal(American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force, 2007). Nursing Actions Complete the appropriate admission assessments andrequired preoperative forms.Expected findings Couples and families may have an increased level of anxietyrelated to the sur gery and method of anesthesia. Anxiety may be related to this being the woman's first surgi-cal experience and fears of the unknown for self and fetus. The expectant father may have concerns about injury tohis partner and/or child.Evidence-Based Practice Guidelines Nursing specialty organizations such as the Association ofWomen's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses facilitatethe use of research finding in clinical practice through thedevelopment of evidence-based practice guidelines. One suchguideline is perioperative care of the pregnant women. Thisguideline describes evidence-based practice to insure the following: 1.Patient safety measures for perioperative care of the pregnant woman 2.Family cent ered education and care practices 3.Assessment and interventions appropriate during preopera-tive, intr aoper ative, and postoperative periods for women undergoing cesarean birth.

Obtain baseline vital signs Obtain laboratory testing as per orders, CBC, platelets,and type and screen. A delay in lab results can result in adelay in surgery. Obtain a baseline fetal heart rate monitor strip before andafter administration of regional anesthesia.Expected findings Category I fetal heart rate Review the prenatal chart for factors that place thewoman at risk during or after cesarean birth and ensurethat physician and anesthesiologist or CRNA are awareof risk factors such as low platelet count. Assess womens' knowledge and educational needs. Provide preoperative education. Identify and respect the cultural values, choices, and preferences of the woman and her family. Individualize care to meet needs of patient and family. Ensure that all required documents, such as prenatalrecord, current laboratory reports, and consent forms, arein the woman's chart. Verify that the woman has been NPO for 6-8 hoursbefore surgery. Women without complications undergo-ing scheduled cesarean birth may have limited amountsof clear liquids up to 2 hours prior to induction of anes-thesia (American Society of Anesthesiologists TaskForce, 2007). Follow hospital policy for NPO status. Complete the surgery checklist, which includes removalof jewelry, eyeglasses/contact lenses, and dentures.Eyeglasses can be given to the support person to bringinto the operating room so the woman can use them tosee her newborn baby. Explain to the couple what they can expect before, dur-ing, and after the cesarean birth. Start an IV line and administer an IV fluid preload as perorders (see Critical Component: IV Fluid Preload beforeAnesthesia). Insert a Foley catheter as per order. Insertion may bedone in the operating room after placement of the spinalor epidural and before the prep. Shave the abdominal and pubic regions with electricclippers. Administer preoperative medications per orders.This might include sodium citrate to neutralize stomachacids. Flamotidine or metoclopramide may be used toreduce the incidence of nausea or vomiting. Prepare the expectant father or the support person whoplans to be present for the birth for the experience byproviding appropriate surgical garb to wear in the operating room. Instruct the expectant father or the support person as towhere he or she will sit and what he or she can anticipateregarding sights, sounds, and smells typical of an operating room. Provide emotional support for the couple as they wait tobe transferred to the operating room. Antibiotic and Venous Thromboembolic Prophylaxis (VTE) Administration of narrow-spectrum prophylactic antibioticsshould occur within 60 minutes prior to the skin incision(AWHONN, 2011). Antibiotics of choice include cefa-zolin, or for women with penicillin and cephalosporin allergy, clindamycin with gentamicin may be given. Perform an assessment for risk of VTE and classify thewoman according to VTE classification guidelines.Preoperative anticoagulant therapy may be necessary for women classified as moderate or high risk, or withhistory of recurrent thrombosis. (American Society ofAnesthesiologists Task Force, 2007 and AWHONN,2011). Apply sequential compression devices prior to surgery onwomen classified as moderate or high risk of VTE. Unscheduled Cesarean Birth Unscheduled cesarean births are usually due to an urgent oremergent cause such as fetal intolerance of labor or placentalproblems. The woman and her family are usually highly anxious and have fears that either the woman and/or infant'shealth is in danger.Emergent cesarean births require immediate preparationof the woman for surgery with minimal time to spendexplaining in detail what is happening. Therefore, thewoman and her partner or support person need an oppor-tunity to debrief during the immediate postpartum period. Urgent and non-urgent cesarean births allow the timenecessary to explain fully what and why a cesarean birth isrequired, but the family still needs time in the postpartumunit to review the events leading up to the cesarean birth. Medical Management Determine the need for a cesarean birth. Explain the reason for the cesarean birth. Explain the surgical procedure and obtain consent.CRITICAL COMPONENT IV Fluid Preload before Anesthesia An IV fluid preload of 500-1,000 mL is given before administra-tion of spinal or epidural anesthesia to increase fluid volume anddecrease risk of hypotension related to effects of anesthetic agent(American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force, 2007 and AWHONN,2011). The use of prewarmed IV fluids in women having a cesare- an birth results in an increased maternal core temperature,improved neonatal umbilical arterial pH, and improved Apgarscores (Yokoyama, et al., 2009).3704_Ch11_291-308 16/09/13 3 Intrapartal Period Anesthesia Management The anesthesiologist or CRNA completes an anesthesiahistory and physical and discusses anesthesia options withthe woman. This may not occur until the woman istransferred to the operating room based on the amount oftime from the decision for need of cesarean birth andtransfer to the operating room. The anesthesiologist or CRNA explains the procedurefor type of anesthesia and addresses the woman's and herpartner's or support person's questions and concerns. The anesthesiologist or CRNA determines the need for aplatelet count.Alert neonatal personnel of the impending cesarean birth. Assess the woman's vital signs.Expected findings The woman's blood pressure is elevated related to anxiety level. There is a potential increase in temperature and pulsera te due to infection and/or dehydration related to prolonged labor and rupture of membranes. Start an IV and administer IV fluid preload as per orders. Ensure labs are completed as per orders; CBC, platelets,and type and screen. Complete and witness surgical and anesthesia consentforms. Insert a Foley catheter as per order. Insertion may bedone in the operating room after placement of the spinalor epidural anesthesia and before prep. Assess the couple's emotional response to the need for acesarean birth.Expected findings Couples and family may experience high levels of anxiety based on fear of injur y to the woman and/or unborn child. Couples are not emotionally or mentally prepared forcesar ean bir th. Couples and family have a knowledge deficit regardingcesar ean bir th and anesthesia options. Couples and family ask questions regarding cesareanbirth and anesthesia options. If hair needs to be removed because it interferes with surgical site, use hair clippers on the pubic region. Ensure that all required documents are in the patient's chart. Complete the surgical checklist. Reinforce reason for cesarean section and address questions. Facilitate the transition to unscheduled surgical birth in atimely manner. Guidelines in all hospitals providing OBcare should have the capability of responding to obstetri-cal emergencies within 30 minutes (AAP & ACOG,2007). Hence the 30-minute \"decision to incision rule.\" Provide emotional support to the couple and familymembers. Review with the couple what to expect during and afterthe cesarean birth. Explain that the woman may feel pressure or pulling asher baby is being born. Prepare the expectant father or support person who plans to attend the birth as to what to anticipate in theoperating room and provide him or her with proper surgical garb to wear in the operating room. INTRAOPERATIVE CARE The cesarean birth often is the first surgical experience formost women and can increase the anxiety level for both thewoman and her partner. Couples are anxious irrespective ofwhether this is a scheduled or unscheduled cesarean birth. Tohelp decrease the anxiety level, ideally the nurse who admittedthe woman for a scheduled cesarean section or the nurse whoEvidence-Based Practice: Predictive Relationshipof Preoperative Anxiety With PostoperativeSatisfaction Hobson, J., Slade, P., Wrench, I., & Power, L. (2006). Preoperative anxiety andpostoperative satisfaction in women undergoing elective cesarean section.International Journal of Obstetric Anesthesia, 15, 18-23. The aim of this study was to determine the predictive relation-ship of preoperative anxiety with postoperative maternal satis-faction. The sample included 85 women scheduled for electivecesarean birth. Degree of anxiety, social support, and aspectsof preoperative preparation were measured within 24 hours of the scheduled cesarean birth. Postoperative measuresincluded the maternal satisfaction scale for cesarean section,recovery from cesarean section scale, and postoperative discharge summary form. Results from this study indicate that the lower the preoper- ative anxiety, the higher the postoperative maternal satisfac-tion. They also indicate that postoperative satisfaction washighest when the woman was highly satisfied with the preoper-ative information provided by the anesthesiologist and whenthe woman's perceived support by her partner was high. Implications of this study for evidence-based practice in enhancing the woman's satisfaction with her birthing experienceare the importance of providing preoperative information to thewoman and facilitating support to the woman from her partner. Nursing Actions Notify the anesthesia and labor and delivery team of theimpending cesarean birth. Initiate continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring.Expected findings Category II or Category III fetal heart rate pattern whenthe cesarean section is r elated to fetal intolerance of labor Help ensure the woman and her support person(s) receiveinformation appropriate to the circumstances. Provide emotional support during transitional processfrom labor to preparation for surgery. Facilitate communication with entire health care team todecrease fear, anxiety, and distress. Facilitate presence of patient support person during preoperative preparation and surgical procedure becauseemotional support decreases anxiety. Administer oxygen when indicated (i.e., signs of fetal intolerance of labor).3704_Ch11_291-308 16/09/13 10:15 AM Page 296CHAPTER 11 Intrapartum and Postpartum Care of Cesarean Birth Families 297 cared for the couple during labor continues to care for themduring the surgery as the circulating nurse. The completeintraoperative team includes a surgeon, an anesthesia provider,surgical first assist, circulating nurse, and neonatal staff. Complications Intraoperative complications are rare owing to the advancesin obstetrical anesthesia and surgical techniques. Womenwho are healthy during pregnancy are at low risk for compli-cations. Intraoperative complications include:HemorrhageIncreased morbidity and mortality rates are associated withpostpartum hemorrhage, which can result in the need foremergency hysterectomy, hypovolemic shock, disseminatedintravascular coagulation, and renal and hepatic failure. Bladder, ureters, and bowel trauma Maternal respiratory depression related to anesthesia Maternal hypotension related to anesthesia, whichincreases the risk for fetal distress Inadvertent injection of the anesthetic agent into thematernal bloodstreamThe woman experiences ringing in her ears, metallic taste in her mouth, and hypotension that can lead tounconsciousness and cardiac arrest (Schwartz, 2006). Anesthesia Management Determine the method of anesthesia.The determination of type of anesthesia is based on which one: Is the safest and most comfortable for the woman Has the least effect on the fetus/neonate Provides the optimal conditions for the surgery(Hughes, Levinson, & Rosen, 2002). Method of anesthesia (Fig. 11-2) Spinal anesthesia is the preferred method for scheduledcesarean sections or f or laboring women who do not have an epidural in place. Spinal anesthesia, which isfaster to place, provides a full sensory and motor block. Epidural anesthesia is used for laboring women whohave an epidur al in place f or labor pain management and then require a cesarean birth. Women with epiduralsmay feel tugging and pulling during the procedurebecause epidurals are not as dense and do not providefull sensory and motor block. General anesthesia, which is rarely used and carriesincreased risks, is indicat ed in the following situations: Rapid delivery is imperative Severe hemorrhage Seizures Failed spinal Gastric aspiration leading to pneumonitis is a potentialcomplication of general anesthesia. Additional conditions that may incr ease the risk of aspir ation include: Morbid obesity Diabetes Difficult airway (American Society of AnesthesiologistsTask Force, 2007). Contraindications for epidural or spinal anesthesiaThe woman's refusal or inability to cooperate with theprocedure Increased intracranial pressure Infection at the site of needle insertion Low platelet count Uncorrected maternal hypovolemia (Chestnut, 2006) Administration (Kuczkowski, Reisner,& Lin, 2006). Position patient with a left tilt to maintain a left uter-ine displacement before, during, and after administra-tion of anesthesia to decrease the risk of aortocavalcompression related to compression on the aorta andinferior vena cava due to weight of the gravid uterus(Chestnut, 2006). Monitor vital signs and oxygen saturation.Expected findings Vital signs and oxygen saturation within normal limits withpotential mild incr ease in blood pressure due to anxiety Hypotension following administration of the anestheticagent Monitor level of anesthesia and effectiveness of anesthesia. Estimate blood loss (EBL). An EBL of up to 1,000 cc isexpected in a cesarean birth. Administer oxytocin after the delivery of the placenta. Administer antibiotics when indicated. Medical Management Operative techniques:There are two primary operative techniques used forcesarean births. Most often, a Pfannenstiel incision or \"bikini cut\" is the skin incision. This is a transverse skin incision made at the level ofthe pubic hairline (Fig. 11-3A). Typically, a lower uterinesegment incision is performed on the (Fig. Figure Spinal and epidural placements.3704_Ch11_291-308 16/09/13 10:15 AM Page 297UNIT 3 The Intrapartal Period 298 The classical cesarean delivery is a vertical incision in the body of the uterus (see Fig. 11-3D). This technique is rareand is used in emergent cesarean births when immediatedelivery is critical. The neonate is delivered through the uterine and abdominal incisions (Fig. 11-4). The placenta is manually removed. The uterus is lifted out of the abdominal cavity and theuterine incision is repaired. Abdominal tissues and incision are repaired. Nursing Actions Conduct a preprocedure informational process according tofacility policy. Include assessments, comments, and lab work. Position patient with a left tilt to maintain a left uterinedisplacement before, during, and after administration ofanesthesia to decrease the risk of aorto-caval compressionrelated to compression on the aorta and inferior vena cavadue to weight of the gravid uterus (Chestnut, 2006).Continue external fetal heart rate monitoring untilabdominal preparation is initiated. Remove the internal scalp electrode after abdominalpreparation and before delivery. FSE should not beremoved until MD orders removal.Expected findings Normal fetal heart rate unless abnormal fetal heart ratewas indication for cesar ean birth Conduct a time-out before the administration of anesthe-sia for validating correct patient, site, and procedure (seeQSEN Safety: Universal Protocol for Preventing WrongPatient, Wrong Site, Wrong Person Surgery). Assist the woman into the proper position for epidural orspinal anesthesia. Reposition the woman after epidural or spinal anesthesiain a supine position with a left lateral tilt to decrease thepressure from the uterus on the inferior vena incision Classicvertic al uterine Lowtransver se uterine Figure 11-3 Abdominal wall and uterine incisions for cesarean births.

Perform abdominal skin prep. Secure the woman to the operating room table with astrap over her upper legs. Perform the duties of the circulating nurse, includinginstrument count, needle count, and sponge count. Check equipment used for the newborn to ensure it is inworking order and all supplies are readily available forcare of the neonate. Assess the couple's response to the cesarean birth.Expected findings Anxiety levels increase related to operating room environment and impeding sur gery. Couples may have concerns related to potential injuryto the woman fr om anesthesia and/or sur gery. The woman may feel abdominal pressure as theneonat e is being deliver ed. Position the expectant father or support person on a stoolnext to the woman's head. Instruct the expectant father or support person as to whathe or she can and cannot touch. Instruct the expectant father or support person to remainseated on the stool. Provide emotional support to the woman and her partneror support person. Facilitate care for the neonate. This is done by theneonatal personnel (neonatal nurse, nurse practitioner,and/or neonatologist) who are present for the birth. At least one person skilled in neonatal resuscitation shouldbe available whose only responsibility is to receive and carefor the baby. Expected findings The neonate's 1- and 5-minute Apgar scores are 7 or aboveunless there is f etal intolerance of labor before the birth. Record the time of delivery of the neonate and delivery ofthe placenta. Complete identification bands and place on theneonate and parents before the neonate leaves the operating room. Ensure that the new mother has an opportunity to seeand touch her newborn and that the new father or support person has an opportunity to hold the newborn if the newborn is going to the nursery. In many birthingunits the neonate, if stable, remains in the operatingroom, skin-to-skin contact is encouraged, and theneonate is then transferred to the L&D recovery roomwith the woman and her partner. Whenever possible, the newborn should remain in theoperative suite with the mother. (AWHONN, 2011). Transfer unstable neonates to the nursery and encouragethe new father or support person to accompany the new-born to the nursery. Neonatal personnel are responsiblefor transferring unstable neonates. Address parents' questions regarding the health of theirnewborn. Complete intraoperative documentation.POSTOPERATIVE CARE The recovery time following a cesarean birth is longer com-pared to vaginal delivery due to the tissue trauma related tosurgical intervention. The usual hospital stay is 3-5 days,with full recovery from surgery taking 6 weeks or longer. Thematernal morbidity rate is increased twofold with cesareandelivery compared with vaginal delivery (Cunningham,Leveno, Bloom, Hanth, Ronse, & Spong, 2010). Principalsources of complications are infection, hemorrhage, andthromboembolism. There is a twofold increase in rehospital-ization. Rates of complications vary based on status ofcesarean, emergency versus planned. Rates of infection withemergency cesarean are reported at 12%, wound complica-tions at 1.2%, and operative injury at 0.5% (Cunningham et al., 2010). Complications Women who enter pregnancy in a healthy state and haveexperienced a healthy pregnancy are at low risk for complica-tions. In contrast, women who experience a prolonged labor,multiple interventions such as internal monitoring, or whohave experienced prolonged rupture of membranes are athigher risk for embolism Paralytic ileus Hematuria related to bladder trauma Infections of the bladder, endometrium, and incision Postpartum hemorrhage is most often identified in the intraoperative period or within the first few hourspost-op.Quality and Safety Education for Nurses(QSEN): Safety Universal Protocol for Preventing Wrong Patient,Wrong Site, Wrong Person Surgery Utilization of the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs)of safety minimizes risk of harm to patients and providersthrough both system effectiveness and individual per-formance (QSEN, 2012). Joint Commission Standard PC13.20 EP 9 states that \"the site, procedure, and patientare accurately identified and clearly communicated usingactive communication techniques, during a final verifica-tion process such as time-out before the start of any sur-gical or invasive procedure\" (Joint Commission, 2003). The operating room circulating nurse assists in actively verifying that this is the correct patient and procedure when\"time-out\" is called immediately before the epidural orspinal procedure begins and immediately before the surgi-cal incision is made to verify that it is the correct site, procedure, and patient.QSEN3704_Ch11_291-308 16/09/13 10:15 AM Page 299UNIT 3 The Intrapartal Period 300 Immediate Postoperative Care (PACU) Immediate assessment and monitoring of maternal and new-born status is influenced by the type of anesthesia and anycomplications preoperatively or intraoperatively, and focuseson both maternal and fetal oxygenation, ventilation, circula-tion level of consciousness, and body temperature. The pur-pose of PACU care is to stabilize VS, bleeding, pain, itching,and nausea, and to monitor anesthesia level (see ClinicalPathway).Equipment comparable to that in the main PACUshould be available to care for post-op OB patients.One RN should be assigned solely to the care of the moth- er until the critical elements are completed, such as report,assessments, and maternal stable vital signs (see CriticalComponent: Postoperative Complications). Estimate blood loss in the PACU. Hospital policy maybe to weigh on a scale pads and chux for more accuratemeasurement of EBL (1gram = 1 cc). Monitor I&O Active warming measures should be monitored if patientis hypothermic One RN should be assigned solely to the newborn until critical elements are completed, such as report,assessment, and stable newborn vital signs. Use facility-based scoring system to determine the appropriate timing for discharge from the recovery room (AWHONN, 2011). First 24 Hours after BirthMedical Management Assess the woman for involutional changes and signs ofpotential complications. Medical orders are usually standardized. These ordersinclude:IV therapy Medications such as analgesics and stool softeners Antibiotic therapy for the woman at risk for infectionrelated to prolonged rupture of membranes, prolongedlabor, or elevated temperature during labor Progression of dietRemoval of the Foley catheter Activity level Immediate care of the newborn is the same for vaginaldelivery and is detailed in Chapters 8 and 15. Anesthesia Management Order pain medications. Order PRN medication to counteract side effects ofintrathecal morphine. When intrathecal morphine isused for post-operative pain management, the anesthe-sia provider manages the woman's pain for the first 24 hours (see Medication: Preservative-Free Morphine).CRITICAL COMPONENT levels. Increased morbidity and mortality rates are associatedwith postpartum hemorrhage, which can result in the need hypovolemic shock, disseminatedintravascular coagulation, and renal and hepatic failure. Surgical site infection rate is estimated to be 3%-15% andsigns include serous or purulent drainage, erythema, fever,pain, and wound dehiscence. Endometritis is usually diagnosed within the rst few daysafter delivery. Fever is the most common sign. Other signsinclude chills, uterine tenderness, and foul smelling lochia.Postoperative Complications A multidisciplinary team approach is needed to provide care towomen experiencing postoperative complications (AWHONN,2011). Nurses have a key role in recognizing deteriorating conditionsin the postoperative period. The most common preventable errorsrelated to cesarean births are: failure to recognize and act uponchanges in vital signs and failure to act on postpartum hemorrhage. Pulmonary embolism presents as an acute event. Signs andsymptoms are dyspnea, tachypnea, chest tightness, shortnessof breath, hypotension, and decreasing oxygen saturation Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN).

Nursing actions are similar to care of women withvaginal birth and/or emphasis on the following (see ClinicalPathway):Review prenatal, labor, and intrapartal records for riskfactors. Monitor vital signs as per protocol. Monitor respiratory rate and level of sedation every hourfor the first 24 hours after administration of intrathecalmorphine (see Critical Component: Maternal RespiratoryDepression Related to Intrathecal Morphine). Assess woman for pain. Use pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for pain relief. Reassess pain at appropriate levels. Monitor the level of sensation. Monitor for side effects of intrathecal morphine and provide appropriate interventions. The primary sideeffects and interventions are:Pruritus (80%): Administer medication as per order, naloxone or Nausea/vomiting (53%): naloxone metoclopramide. Urinary retention (43%) that occurs after removal ofcatheter: Administer naloxone or catheterize as per order. Respiratory depression (3%): Administer oxygen as neededand/or naloxone as per order (Hughes, Levinson, &Rosen, 2002). Monitor for complications of anesthesia. These are:Postpartum hemorrhage related to uterine atony Seizures Neurological deficits (e.g., prolonged decreased sensation in legs) Postdural puncture headaches Assess the fundus and lochia as per protocol. Auscultate lungs, encourage coughing and deep breathing,and assist patient in using incentive spirometry. Assess the abdominal dressing for signs of bleeding. Assess for paralytic ilieus. Sign and symptoms includeabdominal distention, diffuse and persistent abdominalpain, and nausea or vomiting. Monitor for signs of hemorrhage, such as increasedbleeding, increased pulse, and decreased blood pressure. Monitor intake and urinary output (per Foley catheter). Advance diet as tolerated. Regulate IV fluids as per order.Oxytocin is usually added to IV fluids to reduce the risk ofpostpartum hemorrhage related to uterine atony. Assist the woman into a comfortable position for infantfeeding. Breastfeeding mothers may be more comfortablein a side lying position or using the football hold, whichprevents pressure on her abdomen. Assist with infant care. Provide emotional support by actively listening to thecouple recalling their birth experience and by addressingtheir questions and concerns.Expected Assessment Findings Vital signs are within normal limits. Lochia is moderate to scant. The fundus is firm and midline and generally 1-2 cmabove the umbilicus. The abdominal dressing is dry. The catheter is draining clear/yellow urine.Blood in the urine occurs when there has been trauma tothe bladder. The IV site is free of signs of infiltration or inflammation. The pain level is below 3 on a pain scale of 0-10. The woman gradually regains full motor and sensoryfunction as the effects of anesthetic agent decrease.The woman sits at the bedside for short periods of time. The woman may experience itching, nausea, or decreasedrespirations related to side effects of morphine.Itching and nausea are the most common side effect of morphine. Itching varies from a facial rash to a full body rash.Antihistamines ar e given to promote comfort. The woman feeds her newborn with assistance. The partner and family assists in care of the newborn. The couple may be tired and need time to rest. Women with unplanned cesarean births may experienceguilt feelings or a sense of failure or disappointment. Couples with unplanned cesarean births may ask questionsabout the cesarean birth and the events leading up to it. The couple will want time alone with their newborn child. The couple will call family and friends, informing themof the birth. 24 Hours Postoperative to DischargeMedical Management Assess the woman for involutional changes and signs ofpotential postoperative complications. Remove abdominal dressing. The dressing is usuallyremoved on the first postoperative day. Provide discharge instructions. Nursing Actions Nursing actions are similar to the care of women with vaginalbirth with addition to and/or emphasis on the following (seeClinical Pathway):Monitor vital signs as per protocol, generally every 8 hours. Assess breath sounds. Instruct the woman to deep breathe and cough every 2 hours. Instruct the woman on the use of an incentive spirometerif ordered. Assess postoperative pain and medicate as indicated. Use non-pharmacological pain management strategies. Assess the fundus and lochia as per protocol. Use gentlepressure when assessing the fundus due to the woman'sabdomen being tender. Monitor for signs of hemorrhage and infection. Assess the abdominal dressing or surgical wound fordrainage and signs of infection.3704_Ch11_291-308 16/09/13 10:15 AM Page 302CHAPTER 11 Intrapartum and Postpartum Care of Cesarean Birth Families 303 Administer antibiotics as per order. Women who experiencea prolonged labor, prolonged rupture of membranes, orincreased temperature may be placed on antibiotic therapy. Remove the Foley catheter as per order when the womanis able to ambulate to bathroom. This generally occurs 8-12 hours postsurgery. Ensure woman voids after urinary catheter removal at least 200-300 cc. Assist the woman with ambulation and encourage her to ambulate to reduce risk of abdominal pain related togas buildup. Encourage fluid intake to assist in hydration. Discontinue IV fluids per order when the woman is ableto take fluids by mouth and the fundus and lochia arewithin normal limits. Assess bowel sounds and advance to a regular diet as perorder based on the presence of bowel sounds and absenceof nausea and vomiting. Provide information on nutrition to promote tissue healing. Assist the woman into a comfortable position for infantfeeding. Breastfeeding mothers may be more comfortablein a side lying position or football hold, which preventspressure on the abdomen. Assist the woman with infant care. Provide opportunities for the family to ask questionsabout their cesarean birth experience. Facilitate mother-infant attachment by bringing the infant to the woman and ensuring the woman'scomfort. Instruct the family that they need to assist the womanwith infant care and housework as she needs 6 weeks torecover from surgery.Provide teaching on infant care, postoperative care, andpostpartum care. Remove staples before discharge per protocol. Expected Assessment Findings Vital signs are within normal limits.Temperature elevations may be a sign of infection. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. The woman deep breathes and coughs every 2 hourswhile awake. The pain level is 3 or below on a pain scale of 0-10 withthe use of nonpharmacological and pharmacologicalinterventions. The fundus is firm and midline at one finger breadthbelow the umbilicus. The lochia is moderate to scant. The abdominal incision is clean, intact, approximated,and free of redness, edema, ecchymosis, and drainage. The woman spontaneously voids at least 200 mL within4-6 hours of removal of the Foley catheter. The woman ambulates to the bathroom and in hallways. Bowel sounds are present and the woman reports passing gas. The woman is able to tolerate oral fluids and food. Negative Homan's sign. The mother is able to feed her newborn with assistance. The couple cares for the needs of their newborn. The woman may remain in the taking-in phase longerrelated to her focus being on pain control and integrationof the birthing experience.

It is a time of rapid physiological changes within the woman'sbody as it returns to a pre-pregnant state. Women who enter pregnancy in a healthy state and experience a low-riskpregnancy and labor and birth are at low risk for complicationsduring the postpartum period (see Critical Component:Physiological Aspects of Postpartum Nursing Care and Critical Component: Overview of the Postpartum Assessment). The CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotionhave set national health goals that are published in HealthyPeople 2020, several of which relate to the postpartum period(Table 12-1).3704_Ch12_309-336 03/10/13 2:49 PM Page 309UNIT 4 Postpartal Period 310 THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM The reproductive system, which includes the uterus, cervix,vagina, and perineum, undergoes dramatic changes duringthe 6 weeks after the birthing experience. Women are at riskfor hemorrhage and infection. Nursing assessments and interventions are aimed at reducing these risks. Uterus After delivery of the placenta, the uterus begins the process ofinvolution, by which the uterus returns to a pre-pregnant size, shape, and location; and the placental site heals. This occursthrough uterine contractions, atrophy of the uterine muscle,and a decrease in the size of uterine cells. Primiparous womenusually do not experience discomfort related to uterine con-tractions during the postpartum period. Multiparous womenor women who are breastfeeding may experience \"afterpains\"during the first few postpartum days. Afterpains are moderate to severe cramp-like pains that are related to the uterus working harder to remain contracted and/or to the increase ofoxytocin that is released in response to infant suckling. Theuterus needs to be in a contracted state during the postpartumperiod to decrease the risk of postpartum hemorrhage. Thecontracted uterine muscle compresses the open vessels at theplacental site and decreases the amount of blood loss. Nursing Actions Assess the uterus for location, position, and tone of thefundus.After the third stage of labor, assess the uterus: Every 15 minutes for the first hour Every 30 minutes for the second hour Every 4 hours for the next 22 hours Every shift after the first 24 hours or as stated in hospit al/unit pr otocols More frequently if the assessment findings are not within normal limits Rationale: Frequent assessment of uterine tone and place-ment allows for the identification of potential complicationssuch as uterine atony (decreased uterine muscle tone) thatmay lead to postpartum hemorrhage (James, 2008).Therisk for postpartum hemorrhage is the greatest within theTABLE 12-1 HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 OBJECTIVES RELATED TO THE POSTPARTUM PERIOD OBJECTIVEReduce the rate of maternal mortality Reduce maternal illness and complications due to pregnancy (complications during hospital labor and delivery) Increase the proportion of infants that are breastfed:EverAt 6 months At 1 yearReduce postpartum smoking relapse among women who quit smoking during pregnancy Increase the number of women giving birth who attend a postpartum care visit with a health care worker Increase the proportion of pregnancies that are intendedReduce the proportion of females experiencing pregnancy despite use of reversible contraceptive method Reduce the proportion of pregnancies conceived within 18 months of a previous birth Reduce pregnancy rates among adolescent females U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2012.BASELINE12.7 maternal deaths per 100,00 live births 31 .1% of pregnant females experi- enced complications during hospi-talized labor and delivery. 74%43.5%22.7%No baseline data providedNo baseline data provided51.0%12.4%35.3%40.2%TARGET11.4 maternal deaths per 100,000 28%81.9% 60.6%34. 1% No target providedNo target provided56%9.9%31.7%36.2% CRITICAL COMPONENT Physiological Aspects of Postpartum Nursing Care The focus of the physiological aspect of postpartum nursingcare is: Assessing for early signs of potential complications Providing comfort and restoring physiologic functions affected by childbirth Health promotion Family education3704_Ch12_309-336 03/10/13 2:49 PM Page 310CHAPTER 12 Postpartum Physiological Assessments and Nursing Care 311 first hour following delivery (James, 2008).Primary (early)postpartum hemorrhage occurs during the first 24 hoursafter birth, and secondary (late) postpartum hemorrhage ismost prevalent during the first 6-14 days following birth(James, 2008). See Chapter 14 for more informationabout the care of the woman with postpartum hemorrhage. Before assessment: Inform the woman that you will be palpating her uterus. Explain the procedure. Instruct the woman to void. Rationale: An overdistended bladder can result in uterinedisplacement and atony (James, 2008).Encouraging thewoman to void prior to uterine assessment will allow foran accurate assessment of uterine placement and tone. Provide privacy. Lower the head and foot of the bed so that the womanis in a supine position and f l at. Support the lower uterine segment by placing one handjust above the symphy sis pubis ( Fig. 12-1 ). Rationale: During pregnancy there is stretching of the lig-aments that hold the uterus in place. Fundal pressurecould result in uterine inversion (James, 2008).Supporting the lower uterine segment may prevent uter-ine inversion during fundal assessment or massage. Locate the fundus with the other hand using gentledownward pressure. Determine the tone of the fundus: Firm (contracted) orsoft (boggy).A boggy uterus indicates that the uterus is not contractingand places the woman at risk for excessive blood loss (seeCritical Component: Boggy Uterus). If the uterus is boggy,the nurse should: Massage the fundus with the palm of the hand. Rationale: Fundal massage stimulates contraction of theuterus (James, 2008; Katz, 2012). Give oxytocin as per the physician's or midwife's orders. Rationale: Oxytocin promotes contraction of the uterus bystimulating the smooth muscle of the uterus (Vallerand& Sanoski, 2013). Notify the physician or midwife if the uterus does notrespond to massage. Rationale: Lack of response to fundal massage and oxy-tocin administration may indicate complications such asretained placental tissue, or birth trauma. Continueduterine atony can lead to postpartum hemorrhage andrequires assessment and potentially further treatment bythe woman's health care provider. Measure the distance between the fundus and umbilicuswith your fingers.Each finger breadth equals 1 cm. Determine the position of the uterus. Rationale: A uterus that is shifted to the side may indicatea distended bladder . A distended bladder interferes with uterine contractibility, which places the woman at risk foruterine atony and increases her risk of hemorrhage. If the uterus is deviated, soft, or elevated above theumbilicus, the immediat e action is to e xplain to thepatient the need for her to void and to assist her to thebathroom. Reassess the uterine position after thewoman has voided and returned to her bed. If thepatient is unable to void, urinary catheterization may be necessary. Expected assessment findings (Fig. 12-2) After birth, the uterine fundus is palpated midwaybetween the umbilicus and symphysis pubis and is f irm and midline. Within 12 hours after birth of the placenta, the fundusis locat ed at the le vel of the umbilicus or 1 cm above the umbilicus and is firm and midline. 24 hours after birth of placenta, the fundus is locatedat 1 cm below the umbilicus and is f irm and midline. The uterus descends 1 cm per day ; by day 14 the fundus has descended into the pelvis and is not palpable. Document the location, position, and tone of the fundusand interventions. CRITICAL COMPONENT Boggy Uterus A boggy uterus is a sign that the uterus is not in a contractedstate. Risk of excessive blood loss and/or hemorrhage is increased. The immediate action is to massage the fundus with thepalm of your hand in a circular motion until rm and reeval-uate within 30 minutes. If the uterus does not respond to massage, follow the stand-ing order for oxytocin and notify the physician or midwife. Medication Oxytocin (Pitocin, Syntocinon) Indication: Postpartum control of bleeding Action: Stimulates uterine smooth muscle to produce uter-ine contraction Adverse reactions with IV use: Coma, seizures, hypotension,water intoxication Route and doses: 10 units in a liter of IV solution or 10 units IM Nursing actions/implications: Monitor vital signs frequently,assess for signs of water intoxication (drowsiness, headache,anuria), administer with an infusion pump, teach patientthat medications will cause uterine cramping. (Data from Vallerand & Sanoski, 2013) The Endometrium The endometrium, the mucous membrane that lines the uterus, undergoes exfoliation and regeneration after the birth of the placenta through the process of necrosis of the superficial layerof the decidua and regeneration of the decidua basalis 03/10/13 2:49 PM Page 311UNIT 4 Postpartal Period 312 Lower the peripad for inspection and determine theamount of lochia. The amount of flow is determined by the amount of lochia on a perineal pad aft er 1 hour (AWHONN, 2006). Lochia is assessed as scant, light, moderate, or heavy (Fig. 12-3). Scant is less than 1 inch on the pad. Light is less than 4 inches on the pad. Moderate is less than 6 inches on the pad. Heavy is when the pad is saturated within 1 hour(Whitmer , 2011). Assess for clots.Rationale: It is common for lochia to contain clots, whichoccur when the lochia has been pooling in the lower uterinesegment. Small clots should be noted in the patient chart. Large clots should be weighed and findings reported to thephysician or midwife. 10 grams equals 10 milliliters of blood loss. Rationale: Large clots can interfere with uterine contr actions. Clots should be examined for the presence of tissue. Retained placental tissue can interfere with uterineinvolution and lead to excessive bleeding (K atz, 2012) (see Critical Component: Excessive Bleeding). Expected assessment findings (Table 12-2) that contains sloughed off necrotic tissue, undergoes changesthat reflect the healing stages of the uterine placental site(Table 12-2). Uterine contractions constrict the vessels aroundthe placental site and help decrease the amount of blood loss.A primary complication is metritis, which is an infection of the endometrial tissue (see Chapter 14). Nursing Actions Assess lochia each time the uterus is assessed.Rationale: Frequent assessment of lochia in the early post-partum period allows the nurse to monitor blood loss andidentify if bleeding is excessive.CRITICAL COMPONENT Excessive Bleeding Heavy lochia is a sign of excessive bleeding and/or postpar-tum hemorrhage. Assess the tone of uterus. If the uterus is boggy, massage. If the uterus is boggy and displaced to the side, instruct thepatient to void and reevaluate. If rm, change the pad and reevaluate in 15 minutes. In case of continued excessive bleeding, notify the physicianor midwife. Continued heavy bleeding with good fundal tone may indi-cate the presence of a genitourinary tract laceration orhematoma of the vulva or vagina (Katz, 2012). Patient educationTeach the woman how to assess the uterus and explain thenormal process of involution. Teach the woman how to massage her uterus if boggy andinstruct her to notify the nurse while in the hospital andhealth care provider after discharge. Rationale: Secondary hemorrhage often occurs afterthe patient has been discharged. T o prevent serious complications, women should understand the normalprogression of lochia and uterine involution, and reportabnormal amounts of bleeding.

Provide information for reducing the risk of infection. Instruct the patient to change the peripad frequentlyfrom the fr ont to back, and to wash hands before and after changing pads. Rationale: Lochia is a medium for bacterial growth.Frequent pad changes and hand washing are actionsaimed at preventing infection. Document the stage and amount of lochia and interventions. Scant: Blood only on tissue when wiped or 1- to 2-inch stain Light: 4-inch or less stain Moderate: stain Heavy: Satur ated pad Figure 12-3 Comparison of heavy, moderate, light, and scant lochia on pads.

Afterpains occur within the first few days and last 36 hours. They occur more commonly with multiparous womenand incr ease with each additional pr egnancy/birth. The condition may increase when breastfeeding duringthe f i rst few postpartum days. Comfort measures (see Critical Component: Assessmentand Management of Pain in the P o stpartum Period): Empty bladder Rationale: A distended bladder can increaseafterpains. Warm blanket to abdomen Analgesia (ibuprofen is commonly used for postpartumdiscomfort) Rationale: Analgesics alter the perception and response to pain (Vallerand & Sanoski,2013). Relaxation techniques Rationale: According to the gate control theoryof pain, interventions such as applying warmcompresses and promoting relaxation may inter-fere with the transmission and sensation of pain. Provide information on the stages of lochia. Explain that the flow of lochia can increase when gettingup in the morning or after sitting for prolonged periods oftime due to vaginal pooling of lochia, or from excessivephysical activity. Instruct the woman to notify the nurse, physician, or midwife if she experiences: A sudden increase in the amount of lochia Bright red bleeding after the rubra stage Foul odor Rationale: Foul smelling lochia could indicate the devel-opment of an infection. An increase in lochia or the3704_Ch12_309-336 03/10/13 2:50 PM Page 313UNIT 4 314 Provide comfort measures:Apply ice to the perineum, or encourage the use of cold sitzbaths for the first 24 hours. Rationale: Ice causes local vasoconstriction, whichdecreases edema and pr ovides an anesthetic effect (Katz, 2012). Encourage the woman to lie on her side. Rationale: The side lying position decreases pressure onthe perineum. Instruct the woman to tighten her gluteal muscles as shesits down and to relax muscles after she is seated. Rationale: This helps cushion the perineum and increasescomfor t when assuming a sitting position. Instruct the woman to wear peripads snugly to preventrubbing. Instruct the woman to take warm sitz baths starting 24 hours after delivery twice a day for 20 minutes. Rationale: Warm sitz baths promote circulation, healing,and comfor t (James, 2008). According to the gate control theory of pain, a sitz bath using warm water can alter apatient's perception of pain (Wilkinson and Treas, 2011). Administer analgesia per the physician's or such as ibuprofen are effective intreating perineal pain (K atz, 2012). Administer a topical anesthetic per the physician's or mid-wife's order. Rationale: Topical anesthetics may relieve localized discomfor t. Reduce the risk for infection.Instruct the woman to use a peri-bottle with warm waterand rinse the perineum after elimination. Instruct the woman to change the peripad frequently. Instruct the woman to properly dispose of soiled pads andto wash her hands. Rationale: Lochia is a medium for bacterial growth.Frequent pad changes and hand washing will r educe the risk for infection. Document findings and interventions. Breasts During pregnancy, the breasts undergo changes in preparationfor lactation (see Critical Component: Breast Engorgement).Breast fullness is normal and is manifested by swelling of thebreast tissue; however, the breast tissue remains soft and non-tender (James, 2008). Around the third postpartum day, allwomen, breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding, experience somedegree of primary breast engorgement. Primary engorgement,which is an increase in the vascular and lymphatic system of thebreasts, precedes the initiation of milk production. Thewoman's breasts become larger, firm, warm, and tender, and thewoman may feel a throbbing pain in the breasts. Primaryengorgement subsides within 24-48 hours. Women whobreastfeed experience subsequent breast engorgement related to distention of milk glands that is relieved by having the babysuckle or by expressing milk. The primary complication is mastitis, which is an infection of the breast (see Chapter 14).Vagina and Perineum The vagina and perineum experience changes related tothe birthing process ranging from mild stretching andminor lacerations to major tears and episiotomies. The woman may experience mild to severe pain dependingon the degree and type of vaginal and/or perineal trauma. The primary complication is infection at the lacerationsor episiotomy sites. The vagina and perineum undergo healing and restora-tion during the postpartum period. Nursing Actions The perineum is assessed when the fundus and lochia arechecked in the post-delivery period (James, 2008). Afterthat, the perineum is assessed every shift using theacronym REEDA edema, ecchymosis, discharge,approximation of edges of laceration).Rationale: Frequent assessment of the perineum using theREEDA scale will allow identification of potential com-plications such as infection, hematoma, and excess bleeding(James, 2008). See Chapter 14 for more information aboutlacerations and hematoma. Explain the procedure. Provide privacy. Assist the woman to her side. Lower the peripad and separate the buttocks to expose theperineum for assessment. Rationale: Positioning the woman in the side lying posi-tion and removing the peripad will allow f or visualization of the perineal area. It also allows for the assessment ofthe amount of lochia present on the entire peripad.While the woman is in the side lying position, assess therectal area for hemorrhoids. Expected assessment findings:Mild edema Minor ecchymosis Approximation of the edges of the episiotomy or laceration Mild to moderate pain Assess for discomfort (see Critical Component: Assessmentand Management of Pain in the Postpartum Period).Medication Ibuprofen (Motrin) Indication: Mild to moderate pain Action: Decreased pain and inflammation by inhibitingprostaglandin synthesis Common side effects: Headaches, constipation, dyspepsia,nausea, vomiting, edema and mg 6 hours PRN Nursing actions/implications: May be administered withfood or milk to decrease GI upset. Give with a full glass ofwater. Patients with asthma, nasal polyps, or who are aller-gic to aspirin are at risk for hypersensitivity to ibuprofen.Assess pain before and 1 hour after administration. (Data from Vallerand & Sanoski, 2013)3704_Ch12_309-336 03/10/13 2:50 PM Page and Nursing Care 315 Colostrum, a clear, yellowish fluid, precedes milk production. It is higher in protein and lower in carbohydrates than breast milk.It contains immunoglobulins G and A that provide protectionfor the newborn during the early weeks of life. Lactation is further addressed in Chapter 16.Nursing Actions for the Breastfeeding Woman Assess the breasts for engorgement.Inspect the breasts for signs of engorgement: tenderness,firmness, warmth, and/or enlargement. Expected assessment findings: In the first 24 hours postpartum, the breasts are softand non-tender. On postpar tum day 2, the breasts are slightly firm and non-tender . On postpar tum day 3, the breasts are firm, tender, and warm to touch. Assess the nipples for signs of irritation and nipple tissuebreakdown.Rationale: Signs of irritation and tissue breakdown arecracked, blistered, or reddened areas. Skin breakdown ofthe nipples is often associated with an improper infantlatch. (See Chapter 16 for interventions to prevent/treatnipple irritation and breakdown.) Assess for plugged milk ducts (see Critical Component:Plugged Milk Ducts). Nursing Actions for the Non-Breastfeeding Woman Assess the breasts for primary engorgement.Inspect the breasts for signs of engorgement: Tenderness,firmness, warmth, and/or enlargement. Rationale: In women who choose not to breastfeed,milk leakage, br east pain, and engorgement may be experienced between 1- 4 days post-delivery (James, 2008). Expected assessment findings During the first 24 hours postpartum, the breasts aresoft and non-tender. On postpartum day 2, the breasts are slightly firm andnon-tender . On postpar tum day 3, the breasts are firm and tender .CRITICAL COMPONENT Assessment and Management of Pain in thePostpartum Period Pain in the postpartum period may result from uterine con-tractions, perineal trauma, lacerations, episiotomy, nipplepain caused by improper infant latch, breast engorgement,hemorrhoids, and procedures (James, 2008). Pain is considered the fth vital sign and should be assessedroutinely when vital signs are done, when the patient com-plains of pain, before and after a painful procedure, andbefore and after implementation of a pain managementintervention (Wilkinson & Treas, 2011). Assess pain using an appropriate pain scale per agencyprotocol. Many scales measure pain intensity, duration,quality, location, factors that make pain better or worse,and acceptable level of pain. Pharmacologic interventions Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications such asibuprofen can be used for mild to moderate pain. Opioid analgesics can be used for moderate to severepain. These medications are often used in combinationwith a non-opioid medication for added analgesic affect. Non-pharmacological interventions. Examples of non-pharmacologic interventions are as follows: Ice packs Warm compresses Sitz baths Repositioning Topical treatments such as witch hazel pads and anestheticsprays can be applied to decrease localized discomfort. CRITICAL COMPONENT Warm compresses to the breast and breast massage tofacilitate the flow of milk prior to feeding sessions Express milk by breast pump or manually if the infant isunable to nurse, i.e., preterm infant. Ice packs after feedings to reduce inflammation and discomfort Analgesics for pain management Wear a supportive bra Prevention and treatment for non-breastfeeding women Wear a supportive bra. Avoid stimulating the breast. Ice packs to breast Analgesics for pain management Subsides within 24 hours.Breast Engorgement Breast engorgement is caused by an increase in the vascular andthe lymphatic systems within the breast and milk accumulation. Engorgement typically occurs 2-3 days after birth. Physiological engorgement: Breasts are swollen. Pathological engorgement: Breasts are hard, swollen, red, and tender/painful. Breasts feel warm to the touch. Woman may feel a throbbing sensation in the breasts. Woman may have an elevated temperature. Infant may have difficulty latching on due to the severeengorgement (James, 2008). Treatment for breastfeeding women Frequent feedings to empty the breasts and to prevent milkstasis3704_Ch12_309-336 03/10/13 2:50 PM Page 315UNIT 4 Postpartal Period 316 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM Women have an average blood loss of 200-500 mL related tothe vaginal birthing experience. This has a minimal effect on a woman's system due to pregnancy-induced hypervolemia. There is an increase in car-diac output during the first few postpartum hours related toblood that was shunted through the uteroplacental unitreturning to the maternal system. Cardiac output returns topre-pregnant levels within 48 hours. White blood cell (WBC)levels may increase to 25,000/mm within a few hours of birthas the result of stress related to labor and birth, and return tonormal levels within 7 days. Women are at risk for thrombosis related to the increase of circulating clotting factors during pregnancy. Clotting factorsslowly decrease after the birth of the placenta and return tonormal ranges within the first 2 postpartum weeks. A poten-tially life threatening complication of thrombus formation ispulmonary emboli (James, 2008). There is an increased risk of orthostatic hypotension, a sudden drop in the blood pressure when the woman standsup, which is due to decreased vascular resistance in the pelvis.Most women will experience an episode of feeling cold andshaking during the first few hours following birth. This phe-nomenon is referred to as postpartum chills and is related to vascular instability. Nursing Actions Assess pulse and blood pressure:Every 15 minutes for the first hour Every 30 minutes for the second hour Every 4 hours for the next 22 hours Every shift after the first 24 hours or as stated in hospital/unit protocols Rationale: Hemodynamic changes occur during laborand delivery and in the postpartum period. There are rapid changes in blood volume and cardiac output.Assessment of pulse and blood pressure is important in identification of potential complications such asCRITICAL COMPONENT Plugged Milk Ducts Plugged milk ducts are associated with inadequate emptyingof the breast, wearing overly tight bras, and/or failure tochange the infant into different feeding positions (Balkam,2010; James, 2008). Symptoms: palpation of tender breast lumps the size of peas(James, 2008) Treatments: Frequent feedings Changing feeding positions (Mass, 2004; Whitmer, 2011) Application of warm compresses to breast or taking a warm showerprior to feeding session Massaging the breasts prior to feeding session Continued milk stasis or unresolved plugged milk ducts canlead to mastitis and potential breast abscess (Mass, 2004;Whitmer, 2011). Patient education Apply heat to the breasts to increase circulation and comfort. Encourage the woman to wear a supportive bra. Instruct the woman to examine her nipples before feedings for signsof irritation. Instruct the woman to feed her infant frequently on demand orexpress milk if she is experiencing breast engorgement. Provide information on mastitis. Mastitis typically occurs at 3- 4 weeks post-birth. The infection may be due to bacterial entry throughcracks in the nipples, and is associated with milk stasis,stress, and fatigue (James, 2008; Mass, 2004). Symptoms: Fever, chills, malaise, flu-like symptoms,unilateral breast pain, and redness and tenderness inthe infected area The woman needs to report symptoms to her healthcare provider. Treatment: Antibiotic therapy, analgesia, rest, andhydration The woman should continue to breastfeed or pump her breasts as per the physician's or midwife's recommendation. The woman should apply moist heat to the affectedbreast before breastfeeding. Document ndings and interventions. Patient educationInstruct the woman to wear a supportive bra or sports bra24 hours a day until her breasts become soft. Teach thewoman to avoid expressing milk or stimulating the breasts. Rationale: Atrophy in milk secreting cells of the breastscan be caused by back pressur e in the milk ducts that occurs when the breasts are not emptied (James, 2008). Instruct the woman who is experiencing engorgement to: Apply ice to the breasts. Not express milk because this stimulates milk production. Avoid heat to the breast because this can stimulate milkproduction. T ake an analgesic for pain. Document findings and interventions.CRITICAL COMPONENT Overview of the Postpartum Assessment The following should be assessed per the health care provider'sorder or unit protocol. Vital signs, pain, breath sounds Laboratory findings, such as, CBC, rubella status, and Rh status Breasts Uterus Bladder Bowel Lochia Episiotomy, lacerations, perineum, hemorrhoids Lower extremities Emotions, bonding with fatigue3704_Ch12_309-336 03/10/13 2:50 PM Page 316CHAPTER 12 Postpartum Physiological Assessments Nursing Care 317 excessive blood loss, orthostatic hypotension, infection,and gestational hypertension/preeclampsia. An elevatedpulse may indicate excessive blood loss, fever, or infec-tion (James, 2008). Expected assessment findings: Pulse and blood pressure within normal ranges. Afterdelivery there may be a transient 5% elevation in the woman's systolic and diastolic blood pressure (Katz,2012). Bradycardia may occur 6- 10 day s post-deliver y 2011). Assess for orthostatic during the firstfew postpar tum days when moving from a sitting or lying position to a standing position. During first 24 hours postpartum, women need assistance whenambulating.Some postpartum units may include assessment for theHoman's sign each shift. However, evidence suggests thatthe Homan's sign is not an accurate or useful assessment fordeep vein thrombosis (James, 2008). Assess the legs for calf tenderness, edema, and sensation ofwarmth each shift. Compare pulses in both extremities. Rationale: Symptoms of deep vein thrombosis includemuscle pain, tenderness, palpation of a hard cordlik e vessel, swelling of veins, edema, and decreased bloodcirculation to the affected area (James, 2008). Expected assessment findings: No tenderness or sensation of warmth Assess for postpartum chills.Assess temperature. Women who are experiencing chills with temperaturewithin normal ranges should be of fered a warm blanket and reassurance that it is normal. Women who are experiencing chills with elevated temper ature need to be evaluated further for possible infection, and the physician or midwife needs to benotified. Patient educationInstruct the woman on ways to reduce risk of orthostatichypotension. Women should be accompanied by the nurseduring ambulation in the early postpartum period. Rationale: Orthostatic hypotension the patientat risk for f ainting and falls. Instruct the woman to take her temperature if she experiences chills and report temperature elevations to her physician or midwife. Rationale: An elevated temperature over 100.4F ontwo occasions that are 6 hour s apart is a symptom of infection (James, 2008). Encourage frequent ambulation. Rationale: Early and frequent ambulation prevents deepvein thro mbosis by preventing stasis of blood in the lower extremities. Instruct the woman not to cross her legs. Apply TED hose as per orders for women with a history of blood clots (James, 2008). Document findings and interventions. THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM There is a return of chest wall compliance after the birth ofthe infant due to reduction of pressure on the diaphragm. Therespiratory system returns to a pre-pregnant state by the endof the postpartum period. Nursing Actions Assess the respiratory rate:Every 15 minutes for the first hour Every 30 minutes for the second hour Every 4 hours for the next 22 hours Every shift after the first 24 hours or as stated in hospital/unit protocolsCRITICAL COMPONENT Orthostatic Hypotension Women are at risk for orthostatic hypotension during therst postpartum week. Explain cause and incidence of orthostatic hypotension. Instruct the woman to rise slowly to a standing position. Assist the woman when ambulating during the rst fewhours post-birth. Assist the woman to a sitting position if she becomes dizzy orfaint. Use an ammonia ampule if the woman faints. Assess for excessive blood loss. Check lab values such as a complete blood count (CBC) ifordered. Rationale: Components of the CBC, such as the hemat-ocrit and hemoglobin, are assessed in cases wher e excessive blood loss has occurred. The hematocritmeasures the concentration of red blood cells in theblood (Kee, 2009). Hemoglobin decreases by 1.0 to 1.5 g/dL and hematocrit decreases 3%- 4% per 500 mL of blood loss (AWHONN, 2006). Expected assessment findings: Blood loss within normal ranges Hemoglobin and hematocrit within normal ranges Pulse rate normal, blood pressure within normal limits.An incr ease in pulse r ate may be an indicator of exces- sive blood loss. Assess lower extremities for venous thrombosis.Rationale: Increased coagulability associated with pregnancycontinues into the post-delivery period. Additionally, venousstasis may occur when there is limited mobility in the imme-diate postpartum period. These factors lead to an (James, 4 Postpartal Period 318 Women who oxytocin; large amountsof intravenous fluids; multiple birth; an infection; preeclampsia; or who were on bed rest are at risk for pulmonary edema (James, 2008). Expected assessment findings:Within normal limits. The respiratory rate in the postpar-tum period is typically in the range of 16-24 breaths perminute (Whitmer, 2011). Breath sounds clear Document findings and intervention. THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TemperatureIt is common for the postpartum woman to experience mildtemperature elevations during the first 24 hours post-birthrelated to muscular exertion, exhaustion, dehydration, orhormonal changes. A temperature greater than 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) after the first24 hours on two occasions may be indicative of postpartuminfection and requires further evaluation. ImmunizationsWomen who are rubella non-immune should be immu-nized for rubella before discharge (see Critical Component:Rubella Immunization). Women may be required to sign aconsent form prior to administration of the vaccine. Women may also receive vaccinations such as Tdap(tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis), hepatitis B, varicella,and influenza if needed (ACOG, 2012; CDC, 2011;Katz, 2012).Women who sensitized produce IgG anti-D (antibody), which crosses the placenta and attacks the fetal red blood cells, causing hemolysis. Rh isoimmunization is preventable (see CriticalComponent: Prevention of CRITICAL COMPONENT Rubella Immunization Women who contract rubella during the rst trimester havea 90% chance of transmitting the virus to their fetuses. Fetuses exposed to rubella during the rst trimester are atrisk for birth defects that include deafness, blindness, heartdefects, and mental retardation. Postpartum women who are rubella-nonimmune should beimmunized for rubella before discharge. The measles,mumps, and rubella vaccine is often given. Women who are immunized should avoid pregnancy for 4 weeks, although the risk of the fetus developing birthdefects from the vaccine is extremely low. (Centers for Disease Control, 2011)CRITICAL COMPONENT Prevention of Rh Isoimmunization Rho immune globulin is given to Rh-negative women at 28 weeks' gestation. Rh-negative women who gave birth to an Rh-positiveneonate are screened for anti-Rh antibodies (Coombs' test). A second injection of Rho immune globulin is given to thewoman if she is Coombs' negative. Rh isoimmunizationRh isoimmunization occurs when an Rh-negative to Rh-positive blood related to expo-sure to Rh-positive blood either by blood transfusion orduring pregnancy with an Rh-positive fetus.Medication Rh\u00b0(D) Immune Globulin (RhoGAM) Indication: Administered havegiven birth to an Rh-positive neonate Action: Prevents production of anti-Rh (D) antibodies Adverse reactions: Pain at the injection site, anemia Route and dose: 300 mcg (Rhopylac, 1500 IU) IM within72 & Sanoski, 2013) Nursing Actions Assess temperature:Every 15 minutes for the first hour Every 30 minutes for the second hour Every 4 hours for the next 22 hours Every shift after the first 24 hours or as stated in hospital/unit protocols Rationale: Assessing the postpartum patient's tempera-ture allows health care providers to monitor for compli- cations such as infection. Temperature elevations less than 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) duringthe first 24 hours post-birth:Hydrate the woman. Promote relaxation and rest. Reassess in 1 hour after interventions. Rationale: Slight temperature elevations during the first24 hours postpar tum are likely associated with dehy- dration (Whitmer, 2011). Temperature elevation 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) or higher after 24 hours post-birth:Hydrate the woman. Notify the physician or midwife for further evaluation. Rationale: A temperature of 100.4F on two differentoccasions aft er the first 24 hours post-delivery is a sign of infection (James, 2008). Administer rubella vaccine as indicated. Administer other needed vaccines as ordered. Administer Rho(D) immune globulin (RhoGAM) asindicated. Document findings PM Page 318CHAPTER 12 Postpartum Physiological Assessments and Nursing Care 319 THE URINARY SYSTEM Bladder distention, incomplete emptying of the bladder, andinability to void are common during the first few days post-birth. These are related to a decreased sensation of the urge to void and/or edema around the urethra. Diuresis, caused by decreased estrogen and oxytocin levels, occurs within 12 hours post-birth and aids in the elimination of excess tissue fluids. Primary complications are bladder distentionand cystitis (see Critical Component: Cystitis).A straight or \"in and out\" catheterization may bedone if there is little or no edema present andrepeated catheterizations are not needed. An alternative method when a woman is unable to voidis the use of pep p ermint oil. Saturate a cotton ball with peppermint oil. Place the saturated cotton ball in the \"hat\" (urine collec-tion container) with a small amount of water. Place the \"hat\" on the toilet. Instruct the woman to sit on the toilet. The vapors of the peppermint oil have a relaxing effect onthe urinary sphincter. Assess for frequency, urgency, and burning on urination. Notify the physician or midwife if the patient reportsfrequency , urgency and/or burning on urination. Rationale: These are signs of possible cystitis. Expected assessment findings: The woman spontaneously voids within 6-8 hours post-birth. Each voiding is a minimum of 150 mL. The woman does not e xperience frequency, urgency, and burning on urination. Instruct the woman to increase fluid intake to a mini-mum of 8 glasses per day. Document findings and interventions. THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM Abrupt changes occur in the endocrine system after the delivery of the placenta. Estrogen, progesterone, and pro-lactin levels decrease. Estrogen levels begin to rise after thefirst week of postpartum.Nonlactating women: Prolactin levels continue to first weeks. Menses begins7-9 weeks post-birth. The first menses is usually anovu-latory. Ovulation usually occurs by the fourth cycle. Lactating women: Prolactin levels increase in Lactation suppresses menses.Return of menses depends on the length and amount ofbreastfeeding. Ovulation is suppressed longer for lactatingwomen than for nonlactating women.CRITICAL COMPONENT Cystitis urination,and malaise Treatment: Antibiotic therapy, increased hydration, rest Nursing Actions Assist the woman to the bathroom and encourage her tovoid within 6 hours post-birth.Rationale: Early voiding decreases the risk of cystitis. Inaddition, it prevents bladder distention, which could lead touterine atony and postpartum hemorrhage (James, 2008). Assess for voidings during the first 24 hours post-birth. Rationale: Various birth related factors, such as the stretch-ing of the urethr a, displacement of the bladder, birth trau- ma associated neural dysfunction, and anesthesia, mayinterfere with the return of urinary function. Rapid filling ofthe bladder associated with the administration of IV fluidsduring labor and delivery, and postpartum diuresis canlead to overdistention of the bladder (James, 2008).Measuring voidings allows the nurse to identify inadequateoutput and problems with urinary elimination. If voiding is less than 150 mL, the nurse needs to pal-pate for bladder distention. Signs of bladder distention include uterine atony, displacement of the uterus abovethe umbilicus to the right, increased lochia, and fullnessin the suprapubic area (James, 2008). Voiding less than 150 mL of urine is indicative of urinar y r etention with overflow (Whitmer, 2011). Incomplete emptying of the bladder can lead to uterineatony and postpartum hemorrhage. Urinary retentionmay also lead to cystitis. The woman should be able to void within 4-8 hours ofdelivery (Whitmer, 2011). If unable to void within 12 hours post-birth, the womanmay need to be catheterized. A Foley catheter is recommended when inabilityto void is related to edema. Rationale: After 24 hours, edema associated withtrauma of the bladder and urethra related to birthshould decrease (James, 2008).CRITICAL COMPONENT Contraception Women, nonlactating and lactating, are advised to use aform of contraception when they resume sexual intercourseas ovulation can precede their rst menses. Breastfeeding is not an effective means of contraception. Diaphoresis Diaphoresis occurs during the first few postpartum weeks inresponse to the decreased estrogen levels. This profuse sweat-ing, which often occurs at night, assists the body in excretingthe increased fluid accumulated during pregnancy.3704_Ch12_309-336 03/10/13 2:50 PM Page 319UNIT 4 Postpartal Period 320 Nursing Actions Assess for diaphoresis. If present, assess for infection by taking the woman'stemperatur e. Expected assessment findings: Diaphoresis with temperature within normal ranges Patient educationInstruct the woman regarding the cause of diaphoresis. Discuss comfort measures such as wearing cotton nightwear. Instruct the woman to check the temperature and notify thephysician or midwife if elevated. Rationale: Feelings of warmth, sweating, and chills aresigns of fe ver, which is a cardinal sign of infection. Women with these symptoms need to differentiate between feverand diaphoresis, which is a normal physiologic process. Provide information regarding return of menses and ovulation. Encourage the couple to use contraception when theyresume sexual intercourse (see Critical Component:Contraception). Rationale: Some couples may decide to resume sexualinte rcourse prior to the postpartum follow-up appoint- ment. It is recommended that women wait 24 monthsafter birth until the next pregnancy is attempted.Couples should be counseled to use contraception toprevent unintended pregnancy from occurring in thepostpartum period (Kennedy & Trussel, 2011). Document findings and interventions. THE MUSCULAR AND NERVOUS SYSTEMS After birth, the abdominal muscles have a reduction in toneand the abdomen appears soft and flabby. Some womenexperience a separation of the rectus recti abdominis ( Fig. 12-4). This separationbecomes less apparent as the body returns to a pre-pregnantstate.Women may experience muscular soreness related to thelabor and birth experience. Lower body nerve sensation may be diminished forwomen who have received an epidural during labor.Delay ambulation until full sensation returns. Nursing Actions Assess for diastasis recti abdominis.The nurse can feel the separation of the rectus muscle whenassessing the fundus. Reassure the woman that this is normal and will diminishover time. Assess for muscle tenderness.Rationale: Muscle soreness may result from positioningduring labor and delivery, and generalized muscle use during second stage labor/pushing. Expected assessment findings: None to mild muscle soreness Comfort measures for muscle soreness: Ice pack to area for 15 minutes Heat to area Warm shower Analgesia Rationale: Applying heat increases circulation, whichfacilitates healing. Cold packs result in vasoconstrictionand decreased swelling. These interventions may alterthe woman's perception of pain according to the gatecontrol theory of pain modulation (Wilkinson andTreas, 2011). Analgesics alter a patient's perception of pain. Assess for decreased nerve sensation.Rationale: Epidural or spinal anesthesia causes lack ofsensation that may last several hours into the early postpartum period. Regional anesthesia may interferewith urinary elimination and mobility until the effectswear off. Expected assessment findings: Full sensation of lower extremities for women who didnot receive an epidur al during labor Diminished lower body sensation for women whoreceived an epidur al during labor with full sensation returning within a few hours post-birth Delay ambulation or assist the woman when ambulatinguntil full sensation has returned. Rationale: Women who have received spinal or epiduralanesthesia are at risk f or falls until full sensation has returned. Assess for headache. If the woman complains of headache, assess the locationand quality of the headache (James, 2008). Notify the woman's health care provider if the headache isassociated with signs and symptoms of preeclampsia, or if apost-epidural/spinal headache is suspected. Rationale: Women who have had spinal or epiduralanesthesia may develop headaches r elated to dural A B Figure 12-4 Diastasis recti abdominis. A. Normal location of rectus muscles of the abdomen. B. Diastasis recti. Thereis 320CHAPTER 12 Postpartum Physiological Assessments and Nursing Care 321 THE GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM There is a decrease in gastrointestinal muscle tone and motil-ity post-birth with a return to normal bowel function by theend of the second postpartum week.ConstipationWomen are at risk for constipation due to: Decreased GI motility due to the effects of progesterone Decreased physical activity Dehydration and fluid loss from labor Fear of having a bowel movement after perineal lacera-tions or episiotomy Perineal pain and trauma HemorrhoidsIt is common for women to develop hemorrhoids duringpregnancy and/or the birthing process. Hemorrhoids will slowly resolve but can be painful. AppetiteWomen are hungry after the birthing experience and canbe given a regular diet, unless they are on a prescribed dietsuch as for diabetes. Women are exceptionally hungry during the first few postpartum days and may require snacks. Weight lossMost women will experience a significant weight loss during the first 2-3 weeks postpartum. The average American woman at the end of 6 monthspostpartum is approximately 3-4 pounds above her pre-pregnancy weight (Olson et al., 2003). Nursing Actions Assess bowel sounds at each shift.Notify the physician or midwife if bowel sounds are faintor absent. Rationale: Decreased motility can lead to diminishedperista lsis and intestinal obstruction. Assess for constipation.Ask the woman if and when she had a bowel movement. Rationale: Constipation is common in the postpartumperiod. Bowel function usually returns in 2-3 day s after delivery (James, 2008). Decreased frequency of bowelmovements and the passage of hard, dry stools indicateconstipation (Wilkinson and Treas, 2011). Instruct the woman to increase fluid intake and increase fiber and roughage in diet to decrease risk ofconstipation. Rationale: A diet that includes fiber-rich foods ains, and legumes) promotes intes- tinal peristalsis. Adequate fluid intake is necessary whenwomen are encouraged to increase dietary fiber to pre-vent constipation. Intake of 2,000-3,000 mL of fluids aday will soften bowel movements and provide adequatemucus to lubricate the colon (Whitmer, 2011;Wilkinson and Treas, 2011). Ask the woman what she did for constipation during preg-nancy or in the past and implement these strategies.puncture, and subsequent leakage of cerebrospinalfluid (CSF) leading to decreased levels of CSF.Headaches related to epidural or spinal anesthesiatend to be worse when the patient is in an uprightposition and improved when the patient is lying down (Klein & Loder, 2010). Headache may also beassociated with preeclampsia (Klein & Loder, 2010;James, 2008). Assess for fatigue Rationale: Fatigue is a common complaint amongwomen during the postpartum period. Discomfort, and lack of sleep related to infant care activities contribute to feelings of fatigue (James, 2008; Katz, 2012). Promote rest and sleepProvide teaching about the importance of sleep and rest. Encourage the woman to sleep/nap while the baby is sleep-ing, and to prioritize activities, with a focus on self- andinfant care. Cluster nursing care such as assessments, interventions,and medication administration. Rationale: This minimizes disruptions to the woman'ssleep/naps. Medicate the woman for pain as per orders and/or offer non-pharmacologic interventions if appropriate. Rationale: Pain interferes with sleep (Wilkinson &Tr eas, 2011). Document findings and interventions. Evidence-Based Practice: Maternal Fatigue Kurth, E., Kennedy, H., Spichiger, E., I., & Zemp Stutz, E. (2011). Cryingbabies, tired mothers: What do we know? A systematic review. Midwifery, 27, 187-94. The purpose of this study was to synthesize evidence about therelationship between infant crying and maternal tiredness andfatigue during the first 3 months after birth. This study was asystematic review of both quantitative and qualitative studiespublished between 1980 and 2007. Initially 100 studies wereretrieved, and 10 of the studies met specific criteria for the sys-tematic review.Results The amount of infant crying during the first 3 months afterbirth is related to maternal tiredness and fatigue. Infant crying disrupts the mother's circadian rhythm anddecreases time for maternal rest. Exhaustion decreases the mother's ability to concentrate,which leads to concerns about harming the baby. Fatiguemay also trigger depressive symptoms and interfere withinfant-parent interaction. Recommendations Teach parents soothing techniques, and how to cope withinfant crying. Give parents a realistic view of parenting an infant. Help parents identify strategies to decrease maternalfatigue.3704_Ch12_309-336 03/10/13 2:50 PM Page 321UNIT 4 Postpartal Period 322 DISCHARGE TEACHING Discharge teaching for the woman and her partner focuses on:Signs of complications that need to be reported to thephysician or midwife:Excessive lochia (saturating more than one pad in anhour); indicates possible secondary postpartum hemorrhage(Whitmer, 2011). The return of bright red, heavy bleeding after lochia hasdiminished or has become serosa or alba, or the passage of clots; indicates possible secondary postpartum hemorrhage. Foul smelling lochia; indicates possible infection. Increased temperature (100.4\u00b0F [38\u00b0C] or higher); indi-cates possible infection. Pelvic or abdominal tenderness/pain; indicates possibleinfection. Frequency, urgency, or burning on urination; indicatespossible cystitis. Breasts tender, warm, and reddened; indicates possiblemastitis (AWHONN, 2006). Blurry vision, severe headaches may be associated withpreeclampsia. Leg pain may indicate venous thrombosis. Chest pain anddifficulty breathing may be associated with pulmonaryembolism. Thoughts of harming infant or self, and persistent feelingsof depression and sadness, are associated with postpartumdepression. Expected physical changesUterine involution, afterpains, progression of lochia Breast changes, engorgement Diaphoresis and diuresis Weight loss Women can expect to lose approximately 12 poundsimmediate ly after delivery, and an additional 5-8 pounds due to fluid losses associated with uterineinvolution and diuresis (Mattson and Smith, 2011). Self-careHygiene Perineal care care for lactating and Rationale: promotes intestinal peristalsisand reduces the risk f or constipation (Wilkinson and Treas, 2011). Administer a stool softener as health care provider'sorders. Rationale: Stool softeners constipation byincreasing wat elimination (Vallerand (Colace) Indication: Prevention of constipation Action: Promotes incorporation of water into the stool Common side effects: Mild abdominal cramps, diarrhea Route and dose: PO; 100 mg twice a day Nursing actions/implications: Administer with a full glass ofwater or juice; do not administer within 2 hours of otherlaxatives, such as mineral oil. (Data from Vallerand & Sanoski, 2013) Assess for hemorrhoids.Rationale: Hemorrhoids may increase in size duringlabor and cause discomfort in the postpartum period(James, 2008). Instruct the woman to lie on her side, then separate thebuttocks to expose the anus. If hemorrhoids are present: Encourage the woman to avoid sitting for long periodsof time by lying on her side. Instruct the woman to take sitz baths. Rationale: Sitz baths are helpful in promoting circulationand reducing pain. Assess appetite.Assess the amount of food eaten during meals. Ask the woman if she is hungry. Rationale: In most cases, after a vaginal delivery womencan resume eating a r egular diet (James, 2008). Ask the woman if she is nauseous or has vomited. Rationale: Nausea and vomiting may occur duringlabor. Additionally , nausea is a common side effect of opioid analgesics commonly used for pain managementduring labor and delivery (Wilkinson & Treas, 2011). Patient educationInstruct the woman to increase fluid intake, and increase fiber and roughage in diet to decrease risk of constipation. Provide nutritional education. This is especially importantfor lactating women and women who had a cesarean bith. Encourage the woman to ambulate to increase GI motilityand decrease risk of gas pains. Instruct the woman to increase fluid intake to a minimumof 8-10 glasses per day. Document findings and interventions.CULTURAL AWARENESS: Food Preferences AcrossCultures /H17039Foods and how they are prepared can be significant towomen of different cultures. /H17039Ask women of different cultures if there are foods that theyprefer to eat based on their cultural beliefs; if not available inthe hospital, encourage patients to have family membersbring them to the woman. /H17039Ask women of Japanese or Chinese cultures if they prefer hotwater versus ice water at the bedside. /H17039In-service training should be provided to staff about culturesthat are common to that unit.3704_Ch12_309-336 03/10/13 2:50 PM Page 322CHAPTER 12 Postpartum Physiological Assessments and Nursing Care 323 Health promotionNutrition and fluids Instruct the woman about nutritional needs for lactatingand nonlactating women. Lactating women should increase their caloric intake by500 calories per day and have a fluid intake of approxi-mately 2 liters per day. Teach the woman how to use \"MyPlate\" (www.ChooseMyPlate.gov) and how this can assist the woman in meeting her nutritional needs ( Fig.12-5). Smoking cessation and relapse prevention A goal of Healthy People 2020 is to reduce postpartumrelapse of smoking among women who quit duringpr egnancy (Healthy People 2020). Ask women about tobacco use. Teach women about the dangers of smoking (cancer,lung pr oblems such as chr onic obstructive pulmonary disease, osteoporosis). Teach women to never allow smoking around their infant/childr en as secondhand smok e is associated with prob- lems such as ear infections and respiratory problems. Encourage women who quit smoking for pregnancy toremain abstinent. The majority of women who quit smoking during preg-nancy relapse after delivery. Advise all women who currently smoke to quit. Provideinformation about r esources to assist with cessation, such as counseling services/classes, cessation help lines,and medications.Routine health check-ups Stress the importance of following through with follow-up visits to her phys ician or midwife. ContraceptionAssess the couple's desire for future pregnancies. Assess satisfaction with previous method of contraception. Encourage the patient to discuss contraceptive options withthe health care provider. Provide information on various methods of contraception(Table 12-3).AWHONN POSITION STATEMENT Smoking and Women's Health\"Women and girls should not initiate smoking cigarettes, and cur-rent smok ers should pursue smoking cessation. There is no known level of smoking that is considered a safe consumption level.Health care professionals should educate all women about therisks of cigarette smoking and secondhand smoke, screen womenfor tobacco use, and support smoking cessation efforts. Focusingattention on these efforts before, during, and after pregnancy isalso critically important because of the harmful effects of smokingand exposure to secondhand smoke on the fetus and newborn.\" Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN).(2010b). Smoking and women's health. Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, & NeonatalNurses, 39, 611-613.AWHONN POSITION STATEMENT Insurance Coverage for Contraceptives\"AWHONN supports legislation and policies that mandateinsur ance cover age for the range of U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive drugs and devices, aswell as related services. AWHONN considers access to afford-able and acceptable health care, which includes safe and reliable contraceptives, a basic human right.\" Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN).(2010a). Insurance coverage for contraception. Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, & Neonatal Nurses, 38, 743-744. Activity and exercise Explain the importance of activity to decrease risk of consti-pation and to promot e circulation and a sense of well-being. Instruct the woman about appropriate exercises in thepostpar t um, such as walking. Rest and comfort Teach the woman the importance of rest in promotinghealing and lactation. Pr oblem-solve with the woman ways to increase rest time (e.g., nap when the baby is nap ping, prioritizing activities). Encour age the woman to take pain medication as order e d by the physician or midwife.Figure 12-5 MyPlate illustrates the five food groups using a familiar mealtime visual, a place setting. Source: UnitedStates Department of Agriculture, www.ChooseMyPlate.gov. Sexual activityInstruct the couple to discuss with the physician or midwifewhen they can resume sexual intercourse. General guidelines are to resume sexual intercoursewhen the lochia has stopped, perineum has healed, and the woman is phy sically and emotionally ready.3704_Ch12_309-336 03/10/13 2:50 PM Page 323UNIT 4 Postpartal Period 324 TABLE 12-3 METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION METHOD FAILURE RATE AVAILABILITY ADVANTAGES DISADVANTAGES NATURAL METHODAbstinenceNatur al f amily planning WithdrawalLactational amenorrhea method (LAM) BARRIER METHODSCondoms (male and female) Vaginal sponges Cervical caps Diaphragms Spermicidal gels, cream suppository, or foam erone or al contraception0%24%22 % 18%-21%12% if no prior births 24% if previous births 9.5% no prior birth 20.5% women with prior birth 12% 28%9%Handouts and informa- tion from care provider Internet access of information OTC purchaseOTC availableMost have spermicide added PrescriptionMust be fitted by provider If birth or large weight change, needs to berefitted Prescription, must be fitted after birth, largechange in weight OTCPrescription only91-day option cost Readily availableOne-time useMay be placed before intercourse May leave in for up to 30 hours Protects repeated acts of IC Fits snugly over cervix Can remain in place >24 hours forrepeated IC Fits over cervixCan remain in place >24 hours forrepeated IC Readily availableUse at time of ICSuppresses ovulationTake one pill a day.Must have knowledge to fre-quently monitorbody functions: tem-perature, vaginalmucus productionand consistency Requires exclusive a barrier method with LAMincreases effectiveness Allergic reactionsBarrier methods have higher rate of protec-tion when combinedwith spermicides.

Measuring patient satisfactionwith postpartum teaching methods used by nurses within the interaction model ofclient health behaviors. Research and Theory for Nursing Practice, 25, 176-190. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationshipbetween new mothers' interaction with the nurse using differentteaching methods. The design of this study was quasi-experimen-tal with two study groups to examine patient satisfaction withdifferent teaching methods used to deliver postpartum dischargeteaching. Thirty-five women were assigned to each group. Thefirst group received traditional discharge teaching. This consistedof verbal teaching using a discharge teaching form designed bythe hospital as a guide. The teaching included information onself-care, infant care, safety, vaccine schedules, and follow up.The patients also received a New Mom's Handbook. The secondgroup received the traditional discharge teaching and demon-stration, and return demonstration on selected self-care andinfant care skills. The patients were allowed a 30-minute timeEvidence-Based Practice: Discharge Teaching Methods period during which they performed returned demonstration onselected skills. A client satisfaction instrument was used to mea -sure the participants' satisfaction with the postpartum teachingmethod received.Results Satisfaction with both methods of postpartum teaching washigh. There was no difference in client satisfaction scores betweengroups. Recommendations Traditional methods of teaching postpartum discharge infor-mation (verbal instruction, providing written materials) as wellas demonstration/return demonstration methods of teachingshould be used to prepare patients for discharge.Prescribed medicationsExplain all discharge medications, including dose, frequency,action, and 03/10/13 2:50 PM Page 326CHAPTER 12 Postpartum Physiological Assessments and Nursing Care 327 Risk for Disturbed Sleep \u0081 Pain \u0081 Caring for infant \u0081 Feeding infant during the night Altered Skin Integrity \u0081 Perineal trauma, lacerations, episiotomy \u0081 Nipple soreness Risk Metritis retention \u0081 Lack of bladder tone \u0081 Rapid filling of bladder related to increased IV fluid given during labor and delivery \u0081 Diuresis \u0081 Decreased sensation due to anesthesia \u0081 GU tract/edema of urethra etc.Breastfeeding: Risk forIneffective \u0081 Improper infant latch \u0081 Anxiety \u0081 Maternal lack of knowledge \u0081 Pain \u0081 Altered skin for Injury: \u0081 Falls related to orthostatic hypotension \u0081 Falls related to impaired sensation associated with regional anesthesiaRisk for Constipation pain \u0081 Breast engorgement \u0081 Nipple pain \u0081 Muscle soreness Risk of Bleeding Postpartum Self Care Knowledge Deficit Postpartum Self Care Lack of knowledge about physical/physiologic changes of postpartum and related self care measures Problem No. 1: Risk for bleeding Goal: The amount of vaginal bleeding will be within normal limits.

INTRODUCTION The postpartum period is a time of both physiological andpsychological adjustments. As the woman is adjusting to thenumerous physiological changes within her body, she and herpartner are adjusting to their new roles as parents and theeffect these new roles have on the couple's relationship andthe family unit (Fig. 13-1). This chapter focuses on the psy-chological, emotional, and developmental changes that takeplace during the transition to parenthood. TRANSITION TO PARENTHOOD The transition to parenthood is a dynamic developmental process that begins with the knowledge of pregnancy and con-tinues throughout the postpartum period as the couple takeson their new or expanded roles of mother and father. Whetherthis is the first child or tenth child, this transition is a majorlife event that is both exciting and stressful, and producesdevelopmental challenges for the individual, the couple's rela-tionship, and family members. Each individual deals with thegrowth, realization, and preparation of becoming a parent indifferent ways, and cultural beliefs have an effect on how theindividual takes on the role of parent (Table 13-1). The transition to parenthood is fostered or hampered by many factors, some of which include:Previous life experiences: Previous experiences with caringfor infants and children can foster a smoother transition toparenthood. Length and strength of the relationship between partners:A strong relationship between the couple can foster asmoother transition to parenthood. Financial considerations: Financial concerns can hamperthe transition to parenting. Educational levels: Decreased ability to read and compre-hend information regarding child care may hamper thecouple's ability to gain knowledge in the care of the infant. Support systems: A lack of positive support in the care of thewoman and infant may hamper the transition to parenting. 337Don't have time to read this chapter? Want to reinforce your reading?

Age of parents: Adolescent parents may have a more difficult transition to parenting.The transition to parenthood involves taking on the role of mother or father, viewing the child as an individual with hisor her own personality, and incorporating the new child intothe family system.Parental Roles Individuals have many roles throughout their lifetimes. As a child, the individual has the roles of son or daughter,sister or brother, grandchild, and student. Additional rolesare acquired as the individual ages. Roles change over time as the individual matures and new roles are added.The role of mother or father evolves and changes over timeas the child grows and additional children are added to thefamily. Each new role has expectations and responsibilitiesthat the individual must learn in order to be successful inthe role. Couples are given the title of mother and father with the birth of their child, but must learn the expectations andresponsibilities of these roles.Examples of parental role expectations are that others will acknowledge the person as being a parent or that thechild will obey the parents. Examples of responsibilities are that the parents will loveand protect their child.Knowledge of these expectations and responsibilities is acquired through intentional learning (formal instructions)and incidental learning (observing others in the role). Mostindividuals have little intentional/instructional learningregarding the role of mother or father. The majority of learn-ing of the expectations and responsibilities for these rolesoccurs through incidental learning. Examples of incidentallearning of the parental role are:Observing other individuals who are mothers and fathers Recalling how they were parented Watching movies or television programs that have mothers and/or fathers as charactersThe process of learning and developing parental roles should start during the pregnancy. Partners who learntogether during the pregnancy have better outcomes whenthey take on the role of parents. Providing couples with writ-ten information regarding different styles of parenting rolesallows the expectant couple to learn about parenting behav-iors. The expectant couple can then discuss parenting issuesand mutually agree on expectations and responsibilities fortheir new roles. Figure 13-1 Mother and father getting acquainted with their new son. In the 1960s, Reba Rubin conducted qualitative research studiesfocusing on maternal adaptation during the early postpartumweeks. Her research is the foundation of our understanding of thepsychosocial experience of women during the postpartum period.Two concepts identified through her research are \"maternal phas-es\" and \"maternal touch.\" Rubin (1984) refined and modified theprocess as more evidence was linked to maternal adjustments andbehaviors and identified areas of development that womenprogress through to \"becoming a mother.\" Ramona Mercer, a student and colleague of Rubin, added to and expanded this body of nursing knowledge through numerousresearch studies that focused on the maternal role. Based onEvidence-Based Practice: Maternal Adaptation During the Early Postpartum Period these studies, Mercer (1995) developed the theory of \"maternalrole attainment\" that describes and explains the process womenprogress through as they become a mother. Based on her previousresearch and the research of others, Mercer (2004) supportsreplacing the term \"maternal role attainment\" with \"becoming amother.\" The term \"becoming a mother\" reflects that the processis not stagnant but continually evolving as the woman and herchild are changing and growing. The theories generated by Rubin's and Mercer's research agendas are the cornerstone of evidence-based knowledge usedin establishing nursing guidelines for the care of postpartumwomen and families.3704_Ch13_337-356 16/09/13 10:17 AM Page 338CHAPTER 13 Transition to Parenthood 339 TABLE 13-1 CULTURAL BELIEFS AND THE POSTPARTUM FAMILY CULTURE BELIEFS AND PRACTICES ARAB HERITAGE CHINESE HERITAGE FILIPINO HERITAGE HINDU HERITAGE JAPANESE HERITAGE MEXICAN HERITAGE NAVAJO INDIAN HERITAGE Adapted from Purnell & Paulanka (2008).Children are dearly loved and indulged. Care of the newborn includes wrapping the infant's abdomen at birth to prevent cold or wind from entering the body. The call to pray is recited in the newborn's ear.Male circumcision is a religious requirement of Muslims.Breastfeeding is delayed 2-3 days based on the belief that the woman requires rest, and that nursing immediately after birth causes \"colic\" pain for the mother. Pregnancy and childbirth are viewed as women's business.Postpartum care includes 1 month of recovery, and women eat specific foods and avoid exposure to cold air to decrease the yin (cold) energy. Female relatives care for the newborn so that the woman can rest.Women, during the postpartum period, avoid drinking and touching cold water to decrease the yin (cold) energy. The mother often is the major decision maker regarding health, children, and finances.Older relatives such as grandparents share in the responsibility for the care and discipline of younger family members. The woman and her infant remain at home for the first 4 weeks except to go to the doctor.Older female relatives are considered to have expert knowledge in the use of home remedies during pregnancy and the postpartum period. The birth of a son is a blessing because he will carry the family name and take care of aging parents.The birth of a daughter may be cause of concern because of the traditions associated with a dowry.Exposure to cold air is considered dangerous.The mother and infant undergo purification rites on the 11th day after the birth.The baby is officially named on the 11th day.There are prescribed foods to eat and to avoid when the woman is breastfeeding.The primary relationship within the family is the mother-child relationship.It is customary for a mother to sleep with the youngest child until that child is 10 years old.Babies are not allowed to cry. Women constantly hold their babies.Women often return to their mother's home during the last 2 months of pregnancy and stay there for the first 2 months after birth. Female relatives assist with the care of the newborn so that the woman can rest.Maternal rest is viewed as important for successful breastfeeding. Women do not bathe, shower, or wash their hair for the first month after birth.Women care for the children and the home.Cutting the baby's hair or nails during the first 3 months is believed to cause blindness or deafness.Women are discouraged from taking baths or washing their hair for 6 weeks post-birth.Grandmothers and mothers are at the center of Navajo society.Children may be named at birth, but the name is not revealed until their first laugh, when they are considered to officially have a soul. Infants are often kept in cradleboards until they can walk.It is taboo to purchase clothes for the baby before he or she is born.The placenta is buried soon after the birth as a symbol of the child being tied to the land.The newborn is given a mixture of juniper bark to cleanse his or her insides and dispel mucus.3704_Ch13_337-356 16/09/13 10:17 AM Page 339UNIT 4 Postpartal Period 340 Expected Findings Parents identify changing roles and are willing to makelifestyle changes to accommodate the changes. Parents identify with the parental roles. Parents discuss what the roles mean to them. Couples incorporate a third person, the newborn, intotheir relationship. Couples support each other in mutual caregiving tasks. Nursing Actions Nursing actions are directed at supporting the couple asthey take on their role of mother or father. Nursing actionsinclude:Provide an environment that is conducive to rest, suchas uninterrupted periods of time so that parents cansleep.Adequate rest can increase the couple's ability to take innew information and develop new skills. Provide culturally sensitive care.Mother and father role expectations and responsibilitiesvary based on cultural backgrounds. Encourage, through active listening, the parents to talkabout their expectations of each other in their respectiverole of mother or father.Having realistic and mutually agreed upon expectationsdecreases the level of stress within the relationship. Provide parental education on care of the newborn byusing a variety of educational strategies such as handouts,videos, and demonstrations of procedures (burping, swad-dling, entertaining, and stimulating the infant).Information needs to be appropriate and relevant for thecouple. Provide positive feedback for parent's infant care behaviors.New parents are insecure regarding infant care and needto know they are correctly interacting with and caring fortheir infant. Provide information on community parenting classes andsupport groups.This will provide parents opportunities for both intention-al and incidental learning. Becoming A Mother Becoming a mother is a relatively new term used to describeand explain the process that women undergo in their transi-tion to motherhood and establishment of their maternalidentity (Mercer, 2004). Mercer describes four stages through which women progress in \"becoming a mother.\" These are: Commitment, attachment, and preparation for an infantduring pregnancy Acquaintance with and increasing attachment to theinfant, learning how to care for the infant, and physicalrestoration during the early weeks after birth Moving toward a new normal during the first 4 months Achievement of a maternal identity around 4 months(Mercer, 2006, p. 649)The process of becoming a mother begins during pregnancy but can occur before pregnancy. Some women begin preparingfor this role as children when they fantasize about being moth-ers and role-play being mothers with dolls. Others, beforepregnancy, actively improve their health in preparation for thepregnancy (Mercer, 2006). The process of \"becoming a mother\" is influenced by: How the woman was parented Her life experiences Her unique characteristics The pregnancy experience The birth experience Support from partner, family, and friends The woman's willingness to assume the role of mother The infant's characteristics such as appearance and tem-perament (Mercer, 1995, 2006). Nursing Actions Review prenatal and labor records for risk factors such ascomplications during pregnancy and labor and birth.Pregnancy and birth experiences can either enhance orimpede the process of \"becoming a mother.\" Assess the stages of \"becoming a mother.\"Assessment data assists in developing individualized nurs-ing actions. Expected assessment findings:Positive feelings toward being pregnant Positive health behaviors Nurturing behaviors toward the infant Protective feelings toward the infant Increasing confidence in knowing and caring for the infant Establishment of new family routines (Mercer, 2006)Evidence-Based Practice: Transition toMotherhood Nelson, A. (2003). Transition to motherhood, JOGNN, 32, 465-477. In a meta-synthesis of nine qualitative studies that focused onthe transition to motherhood, Nelson (2003) identified actionsof women that facilitate the transition to motherhood: Mercer describes four stages through which women progress in \"becoming a mother\": The woman's commitment to mothering: The higher thewoman's commitment to being a mother, the smoother thetransition. Prenatal discussion of realistic expectations for the transitionto motherhood: The more realistic the woman's expectationsof motherhood, the smoother the transition. The woman being actively involved in caring for her infant:Early and continuous involvement in infant care facilitatesthe transition. Support during the first 6 postpartum months: The greaterthe perceived support, the smoother the transition. The use of role models: The availability of positive mother-hood role models facilitates a smoother transition. Nursing care during the postpartum period that facilitates the transition to motherhood is based on knowledge of theseidentified maternal actions.3704_Ch13_337-356 16/09/13 10:17 AM Page 340CHAPTER 13 Transition to Parenthood 341 Provide rooming-in or couplet care to facilitate bondingand attachment. Provide private time for the parents to interact with theirnewborn. Provide comfort measures for the woman to promote restand healing. Listen to the woman's concerns in order for her toprocess the incorporation of the newborn into her life. Provide information on the care of newborns. Praise the woman for the care she provides to her newborn. Evidence-Based Practice: Nursing Process for theNew Mother Mercer, R. (2006). Nursing support of the process of becoming a mother.JOGNN, 35, 649-651. Mercer summarizes the four stages in the process of becominga mother and provides two major recommendations for sup-porting women during the process of becoming mothers: Empathic listening: Listening to and understanding how thewoman is affected by the process of becoming a mother. Providing feedback to the woman regarding her infant care-taking skills and the way the woman interacts with her infant.MATERNAL PHASES Maternal phases, as defined by Rubin (1963, 1967), is a three-phase process that occurs during the first few weeks ofthe postpartum period (Table 13-2). A delay in transition-ing through the phases may indicate that the woman isexperiencing difficulty in becoming a mother. Factors thatcan affect the woman's transition through the maternalphases are:Medications (e.g., magnesium sulfate or analgesics)that depress the central nervous system (CNS), leading to a sense of tiredness and a slow response to stimuli. Complications during pregnancy, labor and birth, and/orpostpartum (e.g., preterm labor, chronic illness, difficultbirth, or cesarean birth) can cause the woman's focus toshift to her health and well-being, and/or to resolvingfeelings of disappointment. Cesarean births can cause increased discomfort that inter-feres with the woman's ability to care for her infant. Pain causes a shift of maternal attention from focusing oncaring for baby to seeking pain relief for self. TABLE 13-2 MATERNAL PHASES TAKING-IN PHASE TAKING-HOLD PHASE LETTING-GO PHASE Thetaking-in phase, a period of dependent behavior s, occurs during the first 24-48 hours after birth and includes the following maternal behaviors: \u0081The woman is focused on her personal comf ort and physical changes. \u0081The woman relives and speaks of the bir th e xperience. \u0081The woman adjusts to psychological changes. \u0081The woman is dependent on other s for her and her infant's immediate needs. \u0081The woman has a decreased ability to make decisions. \u0081The woman concentrates on personal physical healing (Rubin, 1963, 1967).Thet aking-hold phase, the movement between dependent and independentbehaviors, follows the taking-in phase andcan last up to weeks and includes the following maternal behaviors: \u0081The focus moves from self to the infant. \u0081The woman begins to be independent. \u0081The woman has an increased ability tomake decisions. \u0081The woman is interested in the newborn'scues and needs. \u0081The woman gives up the pregnancy roleand initiates t aking on the maternal role. \u0081The woman is eager to learn; it is an excel-lent time to initiat e postpar tum teaching. \u0081The woman begins to like the role of\"mother . \" \u0081The woman may have feelings of inade-quacy and being over whelmed. \u0081The woman needs verbal reassur ance that she is meeting her newborn's needs. \u0081The woman may show signs and symp-toms of baby blues and f atigue. \u0081The woman begins to let more of the outside world in (Rubin, 1963, 1967). In the letting-go phase, the move- ment from independence to thenew role of mother is f luid and int erchangeable with the taking- hold phase. Maternal character-istics during this phase are: \u0081Grieving and letting go of oldrelationship behavior s in f avor of new ones \u0081Incorporating the newborn into her lif e whereby the baby becomes a separ ate entity from her \u0081Accepting the newborn as he orshe really is \u0081Giving up the fantasy of what itwould/could have been \u0081Independence returning; may goback to wor k or school \u0081May have f eelings of grief, guilt, or anxiety \u0081Reconnection/growth in rela-tionship with par tner (Rubin, 1963, 1967)3704_Ch13_337-356 16/09/13 10:17 AM Page 341UNIT 4 Postpartal Period 342 report that they do not feel they have the knowledge, skills,and support for this new role (Jordan, 1990). The meaning of \"father\" varies based on the man's inter- pretation of the role and its expectations and responsibilities.This is influenced by:How he was fathered How his culture defines the roleIn some cultures, men are not expected to be involved inthe birthing process and/or care of the newborn. By friends and family, and by his partner.The man's partner/wife has a major influence in the degree of the man's involvement in infant and child care. For theman to be an involved father, his partner/wife needs to sharethis desire and to be supportive. Becoming a father evolves over time as the man has increasing contact with his infant, increasing knowledge ofinfant and infant care, and increasing experiences in infantcare. Factors that influence the man's transition to father-hood are:Developmental and emotional age Cultural expectations Relationship with his partner/wife Knowledge and understanding of fatherhood Previous experiences as a father The manner in which he was fathered Financial concerns Support from partner/wife, friends, and family Nursing Actions Provide information on infant care and infant behavior. Demonstrate infant care such as diapering, feeding, andholding.Providing information and demonstrating infant careskills enhances the father's comfort in caring for hisinfant. Praise the father for his interactions with his infant.Praising can encourage continued interactions with hisinfant. Provide opportunities for the father to talk about themeaning of fathering.Talking about the meaning of fathering assists in identify-ing his beliefs regarding the role of father. Facilitate a discussion with the father and his partner toidentify mutual expectations of the fathering role.Mutually agreed upon expectations can decrease the level ofstress within the relationship. ADOLESCENT PARENTS Adolescence is the transition between childhood and adulthood. This transition is a very challenging time as theindividual experiences many physiological, psychological,and social changes. Adolescent parenting is a stressful lifeexperience in that the adolescent is taking on the roleresponsibilities of being a mother or father while at thePreterm infants or infants who experience complicationscan cause additional stresses on the woman and delay hertransition through the phases. Mood disorders, such as depression, cause the woman'sfocus to be more on self and less on the infant. Lack of support from the partner and/or support systemmay lead to maternal exhaustion. Adolescent mothers are more focused inwardly and onpeer relationships than on care of the newborn. The lack of financial resources forces the woman to focuson obtaining basic needs rather than on her infant. Cultural beliefs can have an effect on the behaviors thewoman takes on and the amount of time the womanspends in each phase. In some cultures, such as tradition-al Asian cultures, it is an expectation that the woman restand not be actively involved in the care of her infant or indecision making during the first few months followingthe birth of her infant. Nursing Actions Review prenatal and labor records for factors that mightdelay progression through the maternal phases. Assess for maternal phases.Assessment data assists in developing individualized nurs-ing actions. Expected assessment findings:Taking-in behaviors during the first 24- 48 hours Taking-hold behaviors from 24-48 hours through the firstfew weeks after birth Nursing care during the taking-in phase is directed bythe nurse because the woman is more dependent duringthis phase and has difficulty making decisions. Nursing care during the taking-hold phase is directedmore by the woman as she is becoming more indepen - dent and has an increased ability to make decisions. Provide comfort measures such as backrubs, uninterruptedperiods of rest, and analgesics. Adapt teaching to reflect the maternal phase.During the taking-in phase, teaching is directed to imme-diate learning needs and provided in short sessions as thewoman's focus is on self versus learning about the care ofthe newborn. During the taking-hold phase, praise the woman for herlearning as she is eager to learn but can become frustratedwith not being able to master a new task quickly. FATHERHOOD Men's preparation for the role of father is vastly differentfrom women's preparation for motherhood. In general, mendo not fantasize about being a father, nor do they role-playbeing a father during childhood. During pregnancy, menmentally evaluate how they were fathered and how they wantto father, but the reality of becoming a father may not occuruntil the child is born (May, 1982). Men are less likely thanwomen to read about infant care and parenting during andafter the pregnancy; yet during the postpartum period they3704_Ch13_337-356 16/09/13 10:17 AM Page 342CHAPTER 13 Transition to Parenthood 343 same time working through the developmental tasks ofbeing a teenager.Adolescent parents have had few life experiences thatprepare them for the role conflicts and strain that is expe-rienced by first-time parents. Adolescent motherhood is viewed by the adolescentwoman as either a positive turning point or a hardship(Clemmens, 2003). A majority of adolescent mothers live with their family oforigin until their infant is 1 year old. The adolescent mother's relationship with her ownmother affects the adolescent mother's feelings of com-petency in parenting. A supportive mother-daughterrelationship has a positive effect on the adolescent'scompetency level of parenting (DeVito, 2007). An adolescent father's involvement with his infant ispositively affected by support for father involvementfrom his parents and from the infant's mother (Faganet al., 2007). Adolescent fathers who are involved during the prenatalperiod have a higher involvement with their child follow-ing birth (Fagan et al., 2007). Nursing Actions Nursing actions are directed at supporting the adolescent par-ents in developing child care behaviors and learning to copewith the stress of parenting. Additionally, nursing actions aredirected at increasing the adolescent father's involvement inthe support, care, and nurturing of his child. These nursingactions include:Assess level of knowledge.Information needs to be appropriate and relevant for theindividual and/or couple for learning to occur. Present information at an age appropriate level. Learning styles and teaching strategies are different foryoung teens and older teens. Information needs to beprovided in a manner that will engage the teen in thelearning process. Include the adolescent father in infant care teachingsessions.Adolescent fathers need information and encouragement indeveloping care behaviors. Involve the maternal grandparent in teaching sessionsfocused on infant care.Grandparents need a review of infant care since themajority of teen mothers live with their parents during thefirst year. Discuss with the adolescent parents their expectations ofeach other regarding child care and support.Realistic and mutually agreed upon expectations decreasethe level of stress within the relationship. Involve adolescent fathers in prenatal care based on adolescent mother's comfort level.Adolescent fathers who are involved during the prenatalperiod have greater involvement with infants followingthe birth.BONDING AND ATTACHMENT Bonding and attachment are two phenomena that parentsencounter during their transition to parenting and parentalrole attainment. Bonding is defined as the emotional feelings that begin during pregnancy or shortly after birth between theparent and the newborn (Klaus & Kennell, 1982). Bonding isunidirectional from parent to newborn. Attachment is an emotional connection that forms between the infant and hisor her parents (Bowlby, 1969). It is bidirectional from parentto infant and infant to parent. Attachment has a lifelongimpact on the developing individual. The quality of thisattachment influences the person's physical and emotionaldevelopment and is the foundation for the formation of futurerelationships. With each interaction, the parent and infantbecome more acquainted with each other, recognizing andbecoming sensitive to each other's behaviors. This leads toreciprocal behaviors and emotional bonds between parent andnewborn over time (Table 13-3). Bonding and Attachment Behaviors Bonding and attachment are affected by time, proximity ofparent and infant, whether the pregnancy is planned/wanted,and the ability of the parents to process through the necessarydevelopment tasks of parenting. Other factors that influencebonding and attachment behaviors are:The knowledge base of the couple Past experience with childrenEvidence-Based Practice: Teen Fathers Paschal, A., Lewis-Moss, R., and Hsiao, T. (2011). Perceived fatherhood rolesand parenting behaviors among African American teen fathers. Journal of Adolescent Research, 26, 61-83. In the qualitative study, 30 African American fathers ages 14-19 were interviewed to examine how they defined and per-formed the role of father. Three themes emerged from the data: Provider role 53% of the teen fathers indicated that the primary attri -bute of being a good father was being a good provider. Most of these fathers provide some form of tangible goodssuch as diapers, baby clothes, and baby food. Economic support to the mother and child was sporadic. Nurturer role 27% of the teen fathers indicated that the primary attri -butes that made a good father were emotional involve-ment, physical presence, and/or nurturing. Older teens were more likely to display involved, nurturing,and caregiving behaviors. Autonomous fathers 20% of the teen fathers expressed opposition to the idea offatherhood. These teen fathers did not feel they had an obligation tobe involved in the lives of their children or provide financialsupport.3704_Ch13_337-356 16/09/13 10:17 AM Page 343UNIT 4 Postpartal Period 344 Maturity and educational levels of the couple Type of extended support system Maternal/paternal expectations from this pregnancy Maternal/paternal expectations of the infant Cultural expectations Risk Factors for Delayed Bonding and/orAttachment Maternal illness during pregnancy and/or the postpartumperiod that interferes with the woman's ability to interactwith her infant Neonatal illness such as prematurity that necessitates separation of the infant from the parents Prolonged or complicated labor and birth that leads toexhaustion for both the woman and her partner Fatigue during the postpartum period related to lack ofrest and sleep Physical discomfort experienced by women post-birth Age and developmental age of the woman, such as adolescent or developmentally challenged Outside stressors not related to pregnancy or childbirth(e.g., concerns with finances, poor social support system,or need to return to work soon after the birth) Nursing Actions Review the prenatal and labor record for risk factors thatplace woman/couple at risk for delayed bonding/attachment. Assess for risk factors that could delay bonding andattachment.Early identification of couples at risk can lead to earlyinterventions to enhance bonding/attachment. Assess cultural beliefs.Type of interactions between parents and infants can varybased on cultural beliefs. Assess for bonding and attachment by observation of parent-infant interaction.Assessment data provides information for individualizingnursing actions.Expected assessment findings:Parents hold the infant close. Parents refer to the infant by name or proper sex. Parents respond to the infant's needs. Parents speak positively about the infant. Parents appear interested in learning about the infant. Parents ask appropriate questions about infant care. Parents appear comfortable holding and caring for the infant. Maladaptive assessment findings:Parents call the infant \"it.\" Parents avoid eye contact with the infant (this can beviewed as adaptive based on culture). Parents do not respond to the infant's cries. Parents are emotionally unavailable to the infant. Parents allow others to care for the infant, showing nointerest (this can be viewed as adaptive based on culture). Parents demonstrate poor feeding techniques such as propping bottles, not burping the infant, or seeming to be uncomfortable and/or irritated when nursing. Teach parents about bonding and attachment and theimportance of these to the child's development of futurerelationships.Understanding why it is important enhances likelihood ofincreased bonding and attachment behaviors by parents. Instruct parents regarding the importance of parentsresponding to the infant's cues such as crying, cooing,and movement.Attachment is bidirectional. Promote bonding and attachment by:Initiating early and prolonged contact between the parentand infant. Initiating rooming-in or couplet care. Providing positive comments to parents regarding theirinteractions with the infant. Encouraging mothers to breastfeed. Encouraging the woman and her partner to talk about theirbirth experience and feelings regarding becoming parents. Promote attachment between mothers and infants separateddue to either maternal illness or neonatal complications by:Recommending that family members take pictures of thenewborn and bring them to the mother to keep in her room. Assisting parents to the NICU or nursery so that they cansee and touch their infant. Providing opportunities for parents to care for the infantin the NICU or nursery. Instructing the woman on breast milk pumping andencouraging her to bring breast milk to the NICU for usewith her infant. Informing parents that they can call the NICU or nurseryany time of the day or night and talk with the nurse caring for their infant. PARENT-INFANT CONTACT Early contact between the parents and their infant fosters thedevelopment of attachment of parents and infant and integra-tion of the newborn into the maternal and paternal relationship.TABLE 13-3 BONDING AND ATTACHMENT BEHAVIORS BONDING BEHAVIORS ATTACHMENT BEHAVIORS UNIDIRECTIONAL: BIDIRECTIONAL: PARENT INFANT PARENT INFANT En faceCalls baby by nameCuddles baby close to chest Talks/sings to baby Kisses the babyBreastf eeds the baby or holds the baby close when bottle-feedingParents respond to the infant's cry.

As theyinteract and perform for each other, they find themselvesbecoming more aware of the cues that make them respond toeach other. This interaction cycle of behavior is called reciproc-ity. It is a biorhythmic or inherent rhythm that exists between the parents and newborn that becomes stronger with each inter-action and the passing of time. This sequence of eventsstrengthens the bonding and attachment processes that are thefoundation for all other relationships the infant will establishthroughout his or her life. Maternal Touch Maternal touch is a process that new mothers transition through beginning with the first physical contact with theirnewborns (Rubin, 1963). Most mothers do not instantly feelclose to their newborns. Feeling comfortable holding her new-born close to her body occurs over time with a progressionthrough three stages. These stages, as described by Rubin, are:Initial stage: The woman touches her newborn tentativelywith her fingertips. Second stage: The woman, as she becomes more com-fortable with herself as a mother, uses her hand to strokeher newborn's head or body. Final stage: The mother holds her newborn in her armsand brings her newborn close to her body.Rubin's maternal touch is a component of the acquain- tance process through which mothers and newborns transi-tion. Mothers go through multiple stages of awareness duringearly contacts with their newborns. The first time the newmother touches and meets her newborn, she is excited abouther infant's features and verbally responds to sounds andexpressions the baby makes. Later, after the new motherenters the final stage of maternal touch, she will hold hernewborn en face, a position in which the mother and new- born are face-to-face with eye contact (Fig. 13-2). The enface position provides a positive connection that facilitates thebonding process. Some cultures believe that you should notgaze into the newborn's eyes.engaged in the father role (Chapman, 1991). Reinforcementof this type of involvement has had positive benefits to thefamily unit and has strengthened early and positive parentalinvolvement in the bonding and attachment process. Earlyphysical contact with the newborn provides an opportunity forthe new father to become comfortable touching and holding,which fosters a more active role in caring for his infant (seeCritical Component: Paternal-Infant Contact). New fathers experience an intense preoccupation about and interest in their newborn. Greenberg and Morris (1974)identified these behaviors as engrossment (Fig. 13-3). These behaviors can vary based on the cultural beliefs of the couple. CRITICAL COMPONENT Paternal-Infant Contact The new father, when holding his child for the first time, mayfeel awkward and uncomfortable and have a fear of injuring the baby. These feelings will decrease over time with continuedcontact with the newborn. Figure 13-2 Mother and son in en face position. Paternal-Infant Contact In the 1980s, studies provided data that promoted and sup-ported fathers' involvement in the birth of their infants. Whenexpectant fathers participated in the labor and birth of theirchildren in roles that were comfortable for them, they had agreater sense of belonging, which led to their being moreEvidence-Based Practice: The Newborn's Impacton the Father Greenberg, M., & Morris, N. (1974). Engrossment: The newborn's impact uponthe father. American Journal of Orthopyschiatry, 44, 520-531. In their research of new fathers, Greenberg and Morris identifiedthe concept of engrossment that new fathers experience duringthe postpartum period in relationship to their newborns. Theydefined engrossment as an absorption, preoccupation, andinterest with their newborns. New fathers can be observed gazing at their newborns for prolonged periods of time as if theyare in a hypnotic trance. Greenberg and Morris described sevencharacteristics of engrossment: A visual awareness of the newborn: Seeing their newborn asbeing attractive A tactile awareness of the newborn: Having a desire to touchthe newborn An awareness of their newborn's distinct features: Positivecomments about their newborn's features A perception that their newborn is perfect A strong attraction to their newborn A feeling of strong elation An increase of self-esteem3704_Ch13_337-356 16/09/13 10:17 AM Page 345UNIT 4 Postpartal Period 346 Nursing Actions for Parent-Infant Contact Assess for stages of maternal touch.Assessment data assists in developing individualized nursing care.

Facilitate rooming-in, which provides the opportunity forthe newborn and father to stay in the mother's roomthroughout the hospital stay. Promote parental interaction with the newborn by delay-ing unnecessary procedures. Provide adequate rest periods (2-4 hours every 12 hours)for the parents. This ensures they have the stamina andrest to take care of and provide emotional support to eachother. Provide comfort measures to assist the parents in feelingrested and relaxed. Explain to new parents that they may not feel comfortable holding the newborn close and thatthese feelings will decrease with increasing contact with their newborn. Role model en face positioning. Role model appropriate behaviors by calling the infant byname and identifying normal infant behaviors. Use therapeutic listening and provide positive feedback toparents when they are verbalizing their feelings abouttheir newborn. Educate parents about the newborn's unique behaviorsand temperament. Educate and give information to both parents usingmultiple models of learning.Teaching strategies need to fit the learning style of theparents. Provide culturally sensitive care to the family unit.The way parents interact with their infant can vary basedon cultural beliefs. Figure 13-3 Father exhibiting sign of engrossment by gazing at his newborn son. CULTURAL AWARENESS: Cultural Beliefs InfluenceParents Cultural beliefs influence the ways parents relate to and care fortheir newborns, and the role of fathers during the postpartumperiod and care of infants. An awareness of variations acrosscultural practices is an important component in providingappropriate care. Cultural beliefs can influence: /H17039The degree of father involvement in infant care /H17039The role extended family members have in the care of theinfant and new mother /H17039The method of infant feeding /H17039Foods that are eaten and foods that are avoided during thepostpartum period /H17039When a woman can bathe and wash her hair /H17039When the baby is named and who names the baby3704_Ch13_337-356 16/09/13 10:17 AM Page 346CHAPTER 13 Transition to Parenthood 347 COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PARENT AND CHILD Communication is a bidirectional process that involves asender and a receiver. People communicate through the useof verbal and written words, and through the use of theireyes, ears, faces, and body gestures. Newborns have the ability to see, hear, and smell; to respond to their environ-ment; and to display displeasure. They engage in behaviorsdesigned to evoke a response from individuals in their environments. They rely on vocal noises such as crying andcooing, as well as facial expressions and body movements, toparticipate actively in relationship-building with otherhuman beings. The challenge to parents and care providers isto learn the cues newborns and infants use to communicatetheir needs and pleasures. Nurses are in the unique position to provide information about the newborn's ability to communicate. Nurses can helpparents identify infant behaviors and offer appropriate inter-ventions to promote positive interactions (see CriticalComponent: Positive Interactions between Parents andNewborns). Examples of newborn and infant communicationstyles and cues are:Crying Cooing Facial expressions Eye movements Smelling Cuddling Arm and leg movements Entrainment: A phenomenon in which the newborn and infant moves his or her arms and legs in rhythm withspeech patterns of an adult.Responding to and encouraging newborn and infant com- munication assists the infant in developing communicationand language skills. The parents' ability to recognize theirinfant's positive response cues fosters the parents' confidencein their parenting skills. Teaching parents how to identifytheir newborn's unique cues and behaviors promotes a posi-tive relationship that empowers the dyad to continue to growand learn as the newborn matures and adds new skills andinsights into the relationship. Parents who are aware of and start to understand infant behaviors by becoming cue-sensitive will be able to identify:The best time to communicate with their newborn Ways to comfort Methods to assist infant to self-comfort When the infant is overstimulated and how to providequiet times during these periods of fussiness (White,Simon, & Bryan, 2002)Newborns have very acute senses when interacting with their parents. Newborns who are placed on their mothers'abdomens will crawl to the breast. Newborns also interact withtheir parents by responding to voices and touch. They look en face and root when stimulated. These initial interactionsand ongoing interactions lead to synchrony events, which are reciprocal actions between parents and infants that show mutual expressions of contentment. These interactionsare very pleasurable for parents and infants. Examples of synchrony events are:The mother holds the infant in an en face position. Theresponse to this action is that they gaze into each other'seyes and talk, coo, or smile at each other. The father places his finger in the infant's hand. The infantgrabs the father's finger and they gaze at each other. CRITICAL COMPONENT Positive Interactions Between Parents and Newborns Newborns have the ability to communicate, to interact, and tobe stimulated by early interactions. Depending on the state ofawareness, newborns have the ability to respond positively bybecoming more alert, or negatively by crying. Nurses whounderstand newborn behaviors, infant state of awareness, andcommunication cues can identify and promote positive interac-tions between parents/caregivers and their newborns throughrole modeling and parent education ( Table 13-4 ). Nursing Actions Review prenatal, labor and birth, and postpartum recordsfor factors that might delay or hinder parent-infant com-munication and provide early interventions. Assess parent-infant interactions.Expected findings Parents gently touch their newborn and hold the new-born close to the body. Par ents talk to or sing to their newborn. Parents, when culturally acceptable, hold their newbornen face. Par ents respond to their newborn's cues for interaction and car e. The newborn r esponds to his or her parents' touch and voice. Role model communication with infant. Parents learn through incidental and intentional learning Praise parents for their interactions with their infant. Provide teaching on infant communication: The infant's ability and need to communicate Eye contact, when culturally appropriate Synchronized interactions Recognizing and interpreting the infant's cues Entrainment Infant alertness states FAMILY DYNAMICS Family dynamics are unique ways in which family membersinteract and participate within the family. Adaptation to thesedynamics determines the cohesiveness, or lack of such, in thefamily unit.3704_Ch13_337-356 16/09/13 10:17 AM Page 347UNIT 4 Postpartal Period 348 There are several types of relationships and family compo- sitions. The family structure can be as small as the motherand newborn, or as large as two or more generations plusextended family members. Each has its own unique dynamicsand structure that present challenges and offers rewardingexperiences to nurses who come into contact with these var-ious family compositions. Examples of family compositionsinclude:Married or non-married male-female couples Same-sex couples Adoptive couples Adolescent women with partner, mother, and/or grand-mother as support system Adolescent women without support system Single adult women with no partner Blended familiesThe time immediately after childbirth is filled with many emotional changes for the partners and family members.Family members are redefining who they are as individualsand their roles within the family. Adjustments within thecouple's relationship and family unit occur as the couple andfamily members incorporate and make room for the newestfamily member. Couples make adjustments within their rela-tionship and learn how to support each other in their roles asparents. They reprioritize their other responsibilities and rolesto fit their new roles and responsibilities. Siblings take on therole of older brother or sister and adjust to the decreasedamount of time the parents have available to interact with andcare for them. The family unit is affected and influenced by changes both within the family and outside the family. Outside influences,such as friends and relatives, may have positive or negativeeffects on the family. The couple needs to determine whichresources are helpful and which are stressful, and whom theycan seek for positive assistance. Nursing care is directed atassisting families in identifying their needs and adjustmentduring this period of transition. Coparenting Coparenting is \"a conceptual term that refers to the ways that parents and/or parental figures relate to each other in the roleof parents\" (Feinberg, 2003, p. 96). Coparenting: Occurs when the parents have shared responsibilities inchild rearing Consists of support for each other and coordination theyexhibit in child rearing Does not imply that parenting roles are or should beequal in responsibilities or authority (Feinberg, 2003).Coparenting develops during the transition to parenthood and is influenced by:The parent's beliefs, values, desires, and expectations. The individual's cultural background and the dominantculture of the society (Feinberg, 2009). The infant's temperament (Davis et al., 2009). Multiparas The maternal role changes and becomes more complex with each additional child. Multiparas may have moreknowledge and practice regarding the care of newborns, but they usually experience more exhaustion and have less help than with their first child. In a classic 1979 article, Ramona Mercer described the unique concerns ofmultiparas:Concerns for her other childrenWill her other children feel abandoned?TABLE 13-4 INFANT STATES STATESDEEP SLEEP LIGHT SLEEPDROWSY QUIET ALERTACTIVE ALERT CRYINGBEHAVIORSMinimal body twitches and eye movement.

Older children mayhave a sense of increased responsibility due to their parents'expectation that they assist in the care of younger children. Preparing for the new family addition should begin during pregnancy as the parents talk about the expectednew baby (see Chapter 5). Providing opportunities for thechildren to feel the fetus move and hear the fetal heartbeatare concrete ways to assist the children in understandingthe upcoming event. Discussion on what it will mean to have a new baby in the family can also help in theiradjustments. Siblings should be introduced to their new brother or sister as soon as possible and spend time with mother andbaby during the postpartum hospitalization. They should beallowed to hold and touch the new baby with supervision(Fig. 13-4). Figure 13-4 Big brother meets the new family member.Concerns about being able to love the new childDoes she have the capacity to love this new child as shedoes her other children? Concerns for her ability to care for more than one childDoes she have the time and energy to care for an additionalchild? Concerns about her ability to get rest and sleepWill she be able to find time for sleep and rest? Concerns about having help at home to care for her andher expanding familyWill family members and friends be willing to help herwith a second child? It is important that nurses who care for multiparous women provide the women with opportunities to expresstheir concerns, fears, and doubts in caring for and lovinganother child. Nurses can facilitate this transition by provid-ing reassurance and suggesting strategies in caring for anadditional child. Strategies for caring include:Spend quality time with older child when newborn issleeping. Carry infant in a sling to free hands for doing things witholder child. Have prepared meals ready to use during the day. Encourage the partner to take on more responsibility forcleaning, cooking, and caring for older child. Sibling Rivalry The addition of a new family member can be a stressful lifeevent for siblings within the family unit. They will need tomake adjustments in their young lives in response to the incor-poration of the newborn within the family (see CriticalComponent: Sibling Adjustment). Depending on the age ofthe siblings and birth order, they have varying degrees of feel-ing displaced. Younger children experience a sense of loss overEvidence-Based Practice: Effect of InfantTemperament on Coparenting Davis, E., Schoppe-Sullivan, S., Mangelsdorf, S., and Brown, G. (2009). The roleof infant temperament in stability and change in the coparenting across the firstyear of life. Parenting: Science and Practice, 9, 143-159. In this longitudinal study of 56 two-parent families, theresearchers collected data at infants' age of 3.5 months and 13 months. Data included (1) observational assessments ofcoparenting and (2) mothers' and fathers' perceptions of theirinfant's temperament difficulties. Results: Infant difficulty reported by fathers at 3.5 months was asso-ciated with a decrease in supportive coparenting behavior. Supportive coparenting behaviors observed in fathers at3.5 months was associated with a decrease in reportedinfant difficulties. Recommendations: Early interventions to enhance coparenting are essential forfamilies with temperamentally difficult infants. CRITICAL COMPONENT Sibling Adjustment The addition of a new member to the family can be stressful forsiblings. Actions that can facilitate their adjustment are: Spending time during the prenatal period talking about theupcoming arrival of a new baby Providing opportunities for siblings to feel the baby moveand hear the heartbeat during the pregnancy Providing opportunities for siblings to spend time with theirnew brother or sister during the hospital stay Encouraging siblings to lie in bed with their mother duringhospital visits Giving siblings a present that is from their new brother or sister Explaining to parents the importance of quality time withother children, such as sitting and reading books with them,playing games, and listening to them Taking siblings on a special outing while the newborn staysat home with a babysitter Explaining why babies cry and how they communicate3704_Ch13_337-356 16/09/13 10:17 AM Page 349UNIT 4 Postpartal Period 350 Nursing ActionsVisually Impaired Parents When reporting, use the person's name. Do not refer toher as the \"blind woman in room 211.\" When entering a room, address the person by name andintroduce yourself and anyone else who is in the room. When leaving a room, announce your departure and indi-cate if others are staying or leaving. Speak directly to the person in a clear manner. Do notexaggerate word pronunciation or speak in a loud voice. Keep doors, cabinets, and closets closed to prevent injury. Use sighted-guide when assisting with ambulation (thevisually impaired person holds the elbow of the sightedperson when walking). Avoid shoving, pushing, or grab-bing unless in an emergency. Do not pull on the person's cane to direct her. Do not play with a seeing-eye dog while it is in harness.Ask permission to touch the dog. Orient the person to the area of the room or new locationafter you have guided her to this new area. At a given point (the door or bed), orient the room bydescribing its contents in logical sequence of progressiveorder (e.g., \"To the right as you lie in the bed is thenightstand with the phone and call button; beside that isthe bed curtain and then a chair. Next to the chair is thedoor to the bathroom\"). Describe the location of food on a plate according to theclock face (e.g., \"Potatoes are at 2:00, meat is at 5:00\").Ask the woman if she needs assistance. Offer to read printed material or ask for the preferredmanner for receiving information that is in printed form. Provide space for Braillers and other special equipmentused by the woman. Provide teaching in a manner the parents can understand.Example of teaching instructions:Instruct the parents in diapering by having them diapertheir child while you explain the steps. Provide discharge teaching and instructions in Braille oron audiotape. Hearing Impaired Parents Face the parents when speaking to them. Be articulate but do not exaggerate pronunciation. Speak in a normal voice volume. Be within 6-8 feet of the parents when speaking to them.Make sure that light from windows is behind the parents. Avoid putting your hand over your mouth or turningyour back to the parents when you are speaking.Nursing Actions for Family Dynamics Introducing a new member into the family can be stressful foreach member of the family. The majority of nursing actionsare aimed at reducing stress within the family and familymembers. Nursing actions include:Review the records for relationship issues, pregnancy history, and delivery summary.Complications encountered during pregnancy and/or laborand birth can have a negative effect on family dynamics. Assess for prior experiences with a newborn. Assess for maladaptive behaviors and make referrals tosocial services or the community health nurse as indicated. Respect cultural beliefs and incorporate them in thenursing care.How an individual interacts within the family unit isinfluenced by his cultural beliefs. Provide information of the potential adjustments parents,couples, and siblings will encounter as they incorporatethe newborn into the family. Assist parents in identifying ways to assist their otherchildren in their adjustments to the new family member. Provide positive verbal reinforcement for their familyinteractions. Provide opportunities for family members to talk aboutthe adjustments within the family.Increased communication can decrease misunderstanding. Provide opportunities for couples to talk about theadjustments within their couple relationship and ways toenhance their relationship. PARENTS WITH SENSORY OR PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENTS Parents with sensory impairments such as visual loss or diminished hearing, or those with physical impairments such as decreased mobility, present challenges to nurses and otherhealth care professionals. These challenges can turn into oppor-tunities to creatively adapt nursing care to meet the needs ofthese parents. It is important that health care professionals beaware of the rights of disabled individuals, provide informationin ways they can understand, and provide care that is sensitive to their needs (see Critical Component: Working withParents with a Sensory or Physical Impairment and Critical Component: Assisting Parents with an Impairment). There are ranges in the degree of visual impairment, audito- ry impairment, and physical impairment. Visual impairment/blindness ranges from visual loss, where the person can readlarge print, to complete blindness, where the person has nousable vision. Auditory impairment ranges from mild to pro-found hearing loss. Those with mild hearing loss have enoughhearing to carry on a conversation under ideal conditions.People with profound hearing losses usually rely on sign lan-guage as their form of communication and will not be able toconverse orally with hearing people. Physical impairment canrange from a person being dependent on a cane to people whodo not have motor control of their arms and/or legs.CRITICAL COMPONENT Working with Parents with a Sensory or PhysicalImpairment It is important to treat parents with sensory or physical impair-ments as people and not as disabilities.3704_Ch13_337-356 16/09/13 10:17 AM Page 350CHAPTER 13 Transition to Parenthood 351 When communicating information with the use of illus-trations, provide time for parents to study the illustrations. If there is more than one speaker, take turns speakingwith clear indications as to who is speaking. Minimize background noises (e.g., turn off volume ofTV, close the door to the room). If there is misunderstanding, do not repeat words louder;instead use synonyms or other words that mean the samething. Provide discharge teaching and information in writtenform that parents can easily understand. Use graphics and visuals when available. Ensure a registered interpreter for the deaf person ispresent when discussing medical information and teaching. When using an interpreter:Allow sufficient time for the interpreter to complete a thought. Speak directly to the patient and not to the interpreter. Avoid saying, \"Tell him/her....\" Check the parent for understanding or if he or she is get-ting too much information. Allow time for questions and concerns. A head nod by the parent may have different meanings,such as \"yes\" or \"continue\"; it may not mean that the parent understands. Flick lights on and off to get the attention of the parent.Do not shout, wave, or touch for the purpose of gettingattention. Be aware that hearing aids amplify sound 6-10 times, soshouting and loud noises can be uncomfortable. Provide closed-captioned TV, TDD/TTY (telephonedevice for deaf), writing pad, and implements. Discuss with the parents how they have adapted theirhome for the newborn.Some parents will use a device that causes a light to flashin response to the infant's cry, thus alerting parents to checkon their infant. Some parents might use closed-circuit TV to monitor theinfant while in another room. Parents With Physical Impairments Provide standard ADA-required facilities, such as raisedtoilets, wheelchair accessible rooms and hallways, andeasy-to-use call buttons. Keep the environment free of clutter. Assess the type of assistance needed by asking him or her. Discuss the type of assistance parents will need in caringfor their newborn at home. Assist parents in infant care. Assist parents in developing strategies to adapt infantcare to their limitations. Make referrals to social services when indicated for additional assistance.POSTPARTUM BLUES Postpartum blues, also known as baby blues, occur during thefirst few postpartum weeks, last for a few days, and affect amajority of women. During this period of time, the womanfeels sad and cries easily, but she is able to take care of herselfand her infant. (Postpartum psychological complications arediscussed in Chapter 14.) Possible causes of postpartum blues are: Changes in hormonal levels Fatigue Stress from taking on the new role of motherSigns and symptoms of postpartum blues are: Anger Anxiety Mood swings Sadness Weeping Difficulty sleeping Difficulty eating Nursing Actions Provide information to the couple regarding postpartumblues.Explain that this occurs in the majority of postpartumwomen. Explain the importance of rest in reducing stress. Explain to the woman's partner the importance of emotional and physical support during this period of time. Explain that the woman or family should seek assistancefrom the health care provider if the symptoms persistbeyond 4 weeks or if it is of concern for her or her family, as she may be experiencing postpartum depression.CRITICAL COMPONENT Assisting Parents with an Impairment Nurses can best assist parents who have sensory or physicalimpairments by exploring, identifying, and implementing tech-niques, tools, and alternative ways to: Facilitate bonding and attachment Teach parents about infant care Promote a safe environment for the newborn Enhance the family dynamics.3704_Ch13_337-356 16/09/13 10:17 AM Page 351UNIT 4 Postpartal Period 352 Clinical Pathway for Transition to Parenthood Postpartum Postpartum Postpartum Focus of Care Admission 4-24 Hours 24-48 Hours Discharge Crit eria Emotional status Nursing action Family dynamicsTaking-in phase Provide care and comfort to the woman.

Margarite gave birth to a healthy boy 5 hoursago. Both she and her son are stable. She breastfed her son for15 minutes after the birth. You notice that she is lightly touching the top of her newborn's head with her fingertips. She comments that she does not feelcomfortable holding her baby close to her body for breastfeeding.Discuss your nursing actions that are based on your knowledge of mater- nal touch. List the maternal phase and expected maternal behaviors for this period of time.List five expected bonding behaviors for this period of time. The next day you are again assigned to care for the Sanchez family. Mom and baby are stable. Jos\u00e9, Margarite's husband, ispresent during the shift. Margarite and Jos\u00e9 voice concernabout integrating their newborn into the family.Discuss your nursing actions that reflect an understanding of the couple's transition to parenthood. Discuss specific strategies to decrease sibling rivalry. Margarite tells you that she thinks she experienced postpar- tum depression with her first baby. She tells you that she crieda lot during the first week at home, but was able to care for her-self and her newborn. Discuss the appropriate nursing actions in response to her concerns.3704_Ch13_337-356 16/09/13 10:17 AM Page 354CHAPTER 13 Transition to Parenthood 355 3.Which 2-day postpartum woman has an abnormal find-ing that requires intervention?

INTRODUCTION Most women do not experience a complication during thepostpartum period, but when they do, it can be life threat-ening and disruptive to the family unit. A majority of complications occur after discharge and may require read-mission to the hospital. Most hospitals do not allow theinfant to be readmitted with the mother. Thus, readmissionto the hospital for treatment of complications can interferewith the attachment process and increase stress within thefamily unit. A focus of postpartum nursing care is to reduce women's risks for complications related to childbirth and to identifycomplications early for prompt interventions (see CriticalComponent: Risk Reduction for Postpartum Complications).Women need to be evaluated by their health care providerwhen a complication is suspected. Hemorrhage, coagulation disorders, and infections are the primary physiological complications. Postpartum depressionand postpartum psychosis are the primary psychological complications. 357Don't have time to read this chapter? Want to reinforce your reading?

Nursing actionsto reduce risk are: Reviewing the prenatal and intrapartal records for risk factors such as anemia, long labor, and operative vaginaldelivery and addressing these risk factors in planning care. Assessing for signs of a postpartum complication and intervening appropriately. Early identification and treatment decreases the impact of the complication. Assisting the woman with ambulation. Ambulation assists in uterine drainage. Preventing overdistended bladder. Overdistended bladder can place the woman at risk for uterineatony and/or cystitis. Using good hand washing techniques by health care workers,patients, and visitors. Promoting health with appropriate diet, fluids, activity, and rest.3704_Ch14_357-374 16/09/13 10:17 AM Page 357UNIT 4 Postpartal following the the placenta isaffected by the following physiologic changes:Blood volume increases during pregnancy.Healthy women can lose 500 mL without adverse effectsdue to the normal pregnancy blood volume increase of1,000-2,000 mL or 30% to 60%. Contractions of the uterine myometriumThe blood vessels that supply the placental site pass throughthe myometrium, which is an interlacing network ofsmooth muscle fibers. Contractions of the myometrium compress the blood vessels at the placental site, thus decreasing the amountof blood loss. Hypercoagulability during childbirthFactor VIII complex increases during labor and birth. Factor V increases following placental separation. Platelet activity increases at delivery. Fibrin formation increases at delivery. Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a blood loss greater than 500 mL for vaginal deliveries and 1,000 mL for cesarean deliv-eries with a 10% drop in hemoglobin and/or hematocrit(Harvey & Dildy, 2013). The primary causes of PPH are uter-ine atony, retained placental fragments, and lower genital tracklacerations (see Critical Component: Indications of PrimaryPPH and Maternal Vital Signs). It is estimated that 10% ofpostpartum women will experience a PPH. A major complica-tion is hemorrhagic shock related to hypovolemia. Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is classified into primary (early) and secondary (late) hemorrhage. Primary PPH occurswithin the first 24 hours after childbirth and is due to uterineatony, lacerations, or hematomas. Secondary PPH occursafter 24 hours post-birth and is due to hematomas, subinvo-lution, or retained placental tissue. Risk Factors Neonatal macrosomia: Birth weight greater than 4,000 grams Polyhydramnios High parity Prior PPH Operative vaginal delivery: Use of forceps or vacuumextractor Augmented or induced labor Ineffective uterine contractions during labor: Prolongedfirst and second stage of labor Precipitous labor and/or birth Chorioamnionitis Maternal obesity Congenital or acquired coagulation defectsUterine Atony Uterine atony, a decreased tone of the uterine muscle, is the major cause of primary PPH. Uterine contractions constrictthe open vessels at the placental site and assist in decreasingthe amount of blood loss. When the uterus is relaxed, the vessels are less constricted and the woman experiences anincrease of blood loss. Assessment Findings Soft (boggy) fundus versus firm fundus Saturation of the peripad within 15 minutes Bleeding is slow and steady or sudden and massive Blood clots may be present Pale color and clammy skin Anxiety and confusion Tachycardia Hypotension Medical Management Bimanual compression of the uterus (Fig. 14-1) Oxytocin, methylergonovine, and carboprostto stimulate uterine contractionsDinoprostone and misoprostol may be ordered but are notFDA approved for treatment of uterine atony. IV therapy to reduce risk of hypovolemiaIsotonic, non-dextrose crystalloid solutions (normal salineor lactated Ringer's solution) A ratio of 3 to 1: 3 liters of IV solution for each liter ofestimated blood loss Blood replacement to reduce risk for hemorrhagic shock Platelet transfusion and fibrinogen replacement in management of massive obstetric hemorrhagic shockCRITICAL COMPONENT Maternal Vital Signs \"Careful assessment and interpretation of maternal vital signsare critical in patient care during active bleeding. Obstetricpatients, however, may not show signs and symptoms usuallyobserved in non-pregnant patients with hemorrhage untilapproximately one-third of the woman's entire blood volume islost\" (Harvey & Dildy, 2013, pp. 249 and 251). CRITICAL COMPONENT Indications of Primary PPH A 10% decrease in the hemoglobin and/or hematocrit post-birth Saturation of the peripad within 15 minutes A fundus that remains boggy after fundal massage Tachycardia (late sign) Decrease in blood pressure (late sign)3704_Ch14_357-374 16/09/13 10:17 AM Page 358CHAPTER 14 High-Risk Postpartum Nursing Care 359 Non-surgical interventions such as uterine packing withgauze or uterine tamponadeUterine tamponade: A 24F Foley catheter with a 30 mLballoon is inserted into the uterus via the vagina. Thecatheter balloon is filled with 60 to 80 mL of saline, causing pressure on vessels at placental site. Surgical interventions such as hysterectomy may be indicatedwhen all other treatments have failed to contract the uterus. Nursing Actions (see Critical Component:Management of Uterine Atony) Review prenatal and intrapartal records for risk factor forPPH and monitor more frequently women who are atrisk for uterine atony. Assess for a displaced uterus. An overdistention of thebladder can displace the uterus and cause it to relax.When uterus is displaced:Assist the woman to the bathroom to void, then reassess thelocation and firmness of the fundus and the amount andcharacteristics of the lochia. Catheterize the woman if she is unable to void or is experiencing small, frequent voidings. Assess the fundus for degree of firmness. If boggy:Massage uterus and reassess (Fig. 14-2). Put baby to breast to initiate release of oxytocin. Assess lochia for amount and for clots.Express clots: Clots can interfere with uterine contraction. Weigh bloodied pads and linens to obtain an accurateamount of blood loss: 1 mL of blood = 1 gram. Review laboratory tests such as hemoglobin and hemat-ocrit (H & H). Notify physician or midwife of assessment findings andabnormal test results. Establish IV site with large-bore intracatheter. Administer oxytocin, methylergonovine, and/or carbo-prost to stimulate uterine contractions as per orders. Start and monitor blood transfusions as per orders andprotocol.Provide emotional support and teaching to both thewoman and her support system, as PPH increases theanxiety and stress levels of the woman and her family. Figure 14-1 Bimanual compression of the uterus.CRITICAL COMPONENT Management of Uterine Atony Fundal massage is the rst action to initiate when the uterusis midline and boggy ( Fig. 14-2 ). is when the fundus doesnot respond to fundal massage. Oxytocin therapy is initiated as per orders. An IV is started with 1,000 mL of Ringer's lactate solutionwith 20-40 units of oxytocin added as per orders; and 14 G or 16 G intracatheters are used for IV and blood access. The IV infusion rate is started at 10 mL/min (200 mU/min)and regulated by the firmness of the fundus (You & Zahn,2006). If bleeding continues, methylergonovine or as per Medication uterine atony or subinvolution Action: Stimulates contraction of the uterine smooth muscle Common side effects: Nausea, vomiting, and cramps. Route and dose: IM or IV; 200 mcg every 2-4 hours (onlyone IV dose) Precaution: Check blood pressure before injection; if elevated,do not give until the physician or midwife has been notied.Use with caution with women who have PPH. This medica-tion can increase the blood pressure. (Data from & Sanoski, 2013) Medication Carboprost Tromethamine responded ormethylergonovine therapy Action: Uterine contractions Common side effects: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and fever Route and dosage: IM; 250 mcg, which can be repeatedevery 15 to 90 minutes. Total dose should not exceed 2 mg. (Data from Vallerand & Sanoski, 2013) Lacerations Lacerations, which are the second most common cause of primary PPH, can occur during childbirth. Common sites arethe AM Page 359UNIT 4 Postpartal Period 360 determine the degree of blood loss since the blood is retainedwithin the tissue; thus, PPH may not be diagnosed until thewoman is in hypovolemic shock. Risk Factors Episiotomy is the major risk factor (You & Zahn, 2006) Use of forceps Prolonged second stage Assessment Findings Women express severe pain in the vagina/perineal area,and the intensity of pain cannot be controlled by standardpostpartum pain management. Presence of tachycardia and hypotension. Hematomas that are located in the vagina cannot be visu-alized by the nurse. When located in the vaginal area,women will express severe pain, a heaviness or fullness inthe vagina, and/or rectal pressure. Hematomas in the perineal area present with swelling,discoloration, and tenderness.Risk Factors Fetal macrosomia Operative vaginal delivery: Use of forceps or vacuumextraction Precipitous labor and/or birth Assessment Findings A firm uterus that is midline with heavier than normalbleeding Bleeding is usually a steady stream without clots. Tachycardia Hypotension (Higgins, 2004) Medical Management Visual inspection of cervix, vagina, perineum, and labia Surgical repair of laceration Nursing Actions Review labor and birth records for possible risk factorsand monitor more frequently women who are at higherrisk for lacerations. Monitor vital signs. Monitor blood loss.Weigh bloodied pads and linens to obtain accurate amountof blood loss: 1 mL of blood = 1 gram. Notify the physician or midwife of increased bleedingwith a firm fundus. Administer medications for pain management as perorder. Prepare the woman for a pelvic examination. Provide emotional support to the woman and her family. Hematomas Hematomas occur when blood collects within the connective tissues of the vagina or perineal areas related to a vessel thatruptures and continues to bleed (Fig. 14-3). It is difficult to Figure 14-3 A. Vulvar hematoma. B . High-Risk Postpartum Nursing Care 361 Hematomas with an accumulation of 200 to 500 mLcan become large enough to displace the uterus andcause uterine atony, which can increase the degree ofblood loss. Medical Management Small hematomas are evaluated and monitored withoutsurgical intervention. Large hematomas are surgically excised and the bloodevacuated. The open vessel is identified and ligated.Women experience immediate relief from pain once theblood has been evacuated. Nursing Actions Review the chart for risk factors and monitor more frequently women who are at risk for a hematoma. Apply ice to the perineum for the first 24 hours todecrease the risk of hematoma. Assess the degree of pain by use of a pain scale. Severe vaginal/perineal pain is a primary symptom ofhematomas. Ask women who indicate either verbally or nonverballyan increase of pain if they are experiencing any heavinessor fullness in their vaginal or rectal areas. Monitor for decrease in blood pressure and an increase inpulse rate. Administer prescribed analgesia for pain management. Review laboratory reports such as H & H: A decrease inH & H may be an indication of blood loss. Notify the physician or midwife of nursing assessmentfindings for further evaluation. Provide emotional support and teaching to both thewoman and her family, as increasing pain can increasethe anxiety and stress levels of the woman and her family. Subinvolution of the Uterus Subinvolution of the uterus is a term used when the uterusdoes not decrease in size and does not descend into the pelvis.This usually occurs later in the postpartum period. Before thediagnosis of subinvolution, the uterus and lochia beenundergoing normal involution. Risk Factors Fibroids Metritis Retained placental tissue Assessment Findings The uterus is soft and larger than normal for the dayspostpartum. Lochia returns to the rubra stage and can be heavy. Back pain is present. Medical Management Ultrasound evaluation to identify intrauterine tissue orsubinvolution of the placental site (ACOG, 2006).Medical intervention depends on the cause of the subinvolution.A dilation and curettage (D&C) is performed for retainedplacental tissue. Methergine PO is prescribed for fibroids. Antibiotic therapy is initiated for metritis. Nursing Actions Review prenatal and labor records for risk factors. Monitor women who are at risk for subinvolution of theuterus more frequently. Patient education is the primary action, as PPH fromsubinvolution usually occurs after discharge.Provide education on involution and signs to report, suchas increased bleeding, clots, or a change in the lochia tobright red bleeding. Provide education on ways to reduce risk for infection, suchas changing peripads frequently, hand washing, nutrition,adequate fluid intake, and adequate rest. Explain to women who have fibroids that they are at riskfor subinvolution. Provide instruction on the proper use ofdischarge medication, since these women are usually dis-charged with an order for Methergine PO. Retained Placental Tissue Retained placental tissue is the primary cause of secondarypostpartum hemorrhage. It occurs when small portions of theplacenta, referred to as cotyledons, remain attached to theuterus during the third stage of labor. The retained placentaltissue can interfere with involution of the uterus and can leadto metritis. Risk Factor Manual removal of the placenta Assessment Findings Profuse bleeding that suddenly occurs after the first postpartum week Subinvolution of the uterus Elevated temperature and uterine tenderness if metritis ispresent Pale skin color Tachycardia Hypotension Medical Management D&C is performed to remove retained placental tissue. IV antibiotic therapy may be prescribed because of theincreased risk for metritis. Nursing Actions Patient education is a primary intervention, as PPHfrom retained placental fragment usually occurs afterdischarge.Instruct women to report to their health care provider anysudden increase in lochia, bright red bleeding, elevatedtemperature, or uterine tenderness.3704_Ch14_357-374 16/09/13 10:17 AM Page 361UNIT 4 Postpartal Period 362 Nursing Actions Following a PPH Assess the fundus and lochia every hour for first 4 hoursand PRN after hemorrhage. Assess orthostatic vital signs. Instruct the woman on how to assess the fundus and howto do fundal massage, and the signs of PPH that shouldbe reported to the health care provider. Increase oral and IV fluid intake to decrease risk of hypovolemia. Explain the importance of preventing an overdistendedbladder to reduce the risk for further PPH. Assist with ambulation since there is an increase oforthostatic hypotension related to blood loss. Explain the importance of rest to decrease the risk offatigue related to blood loss. Provide uninterrupted rest periods while in the hospital. Provide an opportunity for the woman and her supportsystem to talk about their feelings and experiences withPPH, as this experience can cause feelings of fear, anxiety,and stress. Provide information on foods high in iron and theimportance of eating a high-iron diet to decrease the riskof anemia. Review the H&H laboratory report. Notify the physicianor CNM of abnormal results. COAGULATION DISORDERS A variety of complications can occur during the postpartumperiod related to alterations in the clotting mechanisms.Three of these complications are disseminated intravascularcoagulation, amniotic thrombosis. which the coagulation pathways are hyperstimulated(Venes, 2009). When this occurs, the woman's body breaksdown blood clots faster than it can form them, thus quicklydepleting the body of clotting factors and leading to hemor-rhage and death.DIC is a complication of an underlying pathologicalprocess, i.e., amniotic fluid embolism. Women who experience DIC are transferred to criticalcare units, and a perinatologist, when available, managesthe care. Risk Factors Abruptio placentaThis is the primary cause of DIC. HELLP syndrome Amniotic fluid embolism (Cunningham et al., 2010) Assessment Findings Prolonged, uncontrolled uterine bleeding Bleeding from the IV site, incision site, gums, and bladderPurpuric areas at pressure sites, such as blood pressurecuff site Abnormal clotting study results, such as platelets andactivated partial thromboplastin time (PPT) Increased anxiety Signs and symptoms of shock related to blood loss:Pale and clammy skin Tachycardia Tachypnea Hypotension Medical Management The focus of medical management is on optimizing hemody-namic function and improving overall tissue oxygenationwhile identifying and eliminating the underlying pathology(Cunningham et al., 2010; Sisson & Mann, 2013).Laboratory partial thromboplastin time [PTT], andplatelet count) to assess for abnormal clotting. Identification of the primary cause of bleeding and inter-vention based on this knowledge IV therapy Blood replacement Platelet transfusion Fresh frozen plasma Oxygen therapy Nursing Actions Reduce risk of DIC.Review prenatal and labor records for risk factors. Monitor women more frequently who are at risk for DIC. Assess for PPH and intervene appropriately. Early inter-vention can decrease the risk of DIC. Monitor vital signs and immediately report to the MD orCNM abnormal findings, such as an increase in heartrate, a decrease in blood pressure, and a change in qualityof respirations. Obtain IV site with large-bore intracatheter as per orders.Administer IV fluids as per orders. Administer oxygen as per orders. Obtain laboratory specimens as per orders. Review laboratory results and notify the physician ofresults. Start a blood transfusion as per orders. Provide emotional support and information to thewoman and her family to decrease level of anxiety. Facilitate transfer to intensive care unit. Amniotic Fluid Embolism Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE), also referred to as anaphy-lactoid syndrome of pregnancy, is a rare but often fatal com-plication that occurs during pregnancy, labor and birth, andthe first 24 hours post-birth. Amniotic fluid that contains and vernix enters the maternal vascular systemand initiates a cascading process intravascular coagulation (DIC).3704_Ch14_357-374 16/09/13 10:17 AM Page 362CHAPTER 14 High-Risk Postpartum Nursing Care 363 The process that causes the fluid to enter into the maternalvascular system is not clearly understood.Areas of potential entry points of amniotic fluid are:Cervix following rupture of amniotic membranes. Site of placental separation. Site of uterine trauma\u2014lacerations that occur during thelabor and delivery process (Jones & Clark, 2013). AFE is a two-stage process (Table 14-1). Women with AFE usually die within 1 hour of onset ofsymptoms. It is estimated that there is one case per 8,000 to 30,000 pregnancies (Moore, 2012). Risk Factors Numerous risk factors, such as induction of labor, abruptioplacenta, and placenta previa, have been postulated, butthere are no reliable risk factors that predict AFE (Jones &Clark, 2013). Assessment Findings Dyspnea Seizures Hypotension Cyanosis Cardiopulmonary arrest Uterine atony that causes massive hemorrhage and leadsto disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) Cardiac and respiratory arrest Medical Management There are no scientific data to support any interventionthat improves maternal prognosis with AFE(Cunningham et al., 2010). The focus is on maintaining cardiac and respiratory func-tion, stopping the hemorrhage, and correcting blood loss. Complete blood count (CBC), platelet count, arterialblood gases, fibrinogen, and PT are a few of the laborato-ry tests that might be ordered. Blood type and screen for possible transfusion.Chest x-ray exam Blood replacement, packed red blood cells, and platelets. Transfer the woman to the critical care unit. A heart-lung bypass machine, when available, may beused to help stabilize the woman. Nursing Actions Monitor for signs of AFE. Notify the physician, immediately, of assessment data, sothat early interventions can be initiated. Administer oxygen. Establish 2 IV sites with large-bore intracatheters: one for IV fluid replacement and one for blood replacement. Obtain laboratory specimens as per orders. Administer blood replacement as per order. Provide emotional support to the woman and her supportsystem. Call code and initiate CPR when indicated. Facilitate transfer to intensive care unit (Kramer,Rouleau, Baskett, & Joseph, 2006; Schoening, 2006). Thrombosis Thrombosis is a blood clot within the vascular system. During pregnancy and the first 6 weeks post-birth, womenare at risk for forming blood clots. This is related to the nor-mal physiological changes that occur during pregnancy.During pregnancy, there is an increase in clotting factors I, II,VII, IX, X, and XII, as well as an increase in fibrinogen.These components of clotting remain elevated during thepostpartum period.Thrombosis during pregnancy and/or the postpartumperiod usually occurs in a vein of the legs and is referredto as a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A major concern is that the clot will detach, becomingan embolism, and travel to a vital organ; an example is apulmonary embolism. Nursing actions focus on decreasing the risk for formationof thrombosis and risk of embolism. Risk Factors Normal physiological changes in coagulation related topregnancy Cesarean birth, which has a risk five times greater thanvaginal birth Metritis, which can spread to the vascular system, causingthrombophlebitis, and can lead to thrombosis Decreased mobility, which increases the risk for venousstasis Obesity, which places extra pressure on pelvic vessels,causing venous stasis Assessment Findings Tenderness and heat over the affected area Leg pain with walking Swelling in the affected legTABLE 14-1 AMNIOTIC FLUID EMBOLISM: A TWO-STAGE PROCESS Stage 1Amniotic fluid and fetal cells enter the maternal circulation release of endogenous mediator s pulmonar y vasospasm and pulmonary hypotension hypoxia myocardial and pul- monary capillary damage left heart failure and acute respiratory distress Stage 2Hemorrhage and DIC Schoening, 20063704_Ch14_357-374 16/09/13 10:17 Management Doppler ultrasonography to confirm the diagnosis Coagulation therapy of IV heparin and warfarin Antibiotic therapy if thrombosis is related to infection Bed rest with the affected leg elevated Compression stockings Nursing Actions Review prenatal and labor records for risk factors. Monitor women who are at greater risk for thrombosismore frequently. Apply compression stockings as per orders; compressionstockings reduce venous stasis and risk of DVT. Assist with ambulation. Early ambulation increases circu-lation and decreases the risk of venous stasis. Report assessment finding of possible signs of thrombosisto the physician or CNM for further evaluation. Administer medications as per orders. Provide discharge teaching regarding use of heparinand/or warfarin. INFECTIONS It is estimated that 1% to 8% of postpartum women willexperience a postpartum infection (Wong, 2012). It is alsoestimated that 0.6 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births areattributed to postpartum infections (Wong, 2012). The mostcommon sites for infections during the postpartum periodare the uterus, bladder, breast, and incisional site. Mostinfections that occur during the postpartum period can beeasily treated when identified at an early stage. Infectionsthat are not identified and treated at an early stage can leadto serious complications such as abscess formation, cellulitis,thrombophlebitis, and septic shock (see Critical Component:Postpartum Infections: Risk Reduction).Risk Factors Cesarean birth: Primary risk factor Prolonged rupture of membranes Prolonged labor Internal fetal and uterine monitoring Meconium-stained fluid Multiple cervical exams during labor Obesity Assessment Findings Elevated temperature greater than 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) with orwithout chills Lower abdominal pain or discomfort Uterine tenderness Tachycardia Subinvolution Malaise Lower abdominal pain or discomfort Lochia heavy and foul smelling when anaerobic organ-isms are presentFoul smelling lochia is a later sign that occurs when theentire endometrium is involved. Lochia is scant and odorless when beta-hemolyticStreptococcus is present. Medical Management CBC to assess for leukocytosis (white blood cell [WBC]count >20,000/mm 3). Endometrial cultures Blood cultures Urinalysis to rule out urinary tract infection, which canpresent with similar symptoms Antibiotic therapyMild cases: Oral antibiotic therapy Moderate to severe cases: IV antibiotic therapy, which isdiscontinued after the woman is afebrile for 24 hours. Improvement should be noted within 72 hours of initia-tion of antibiotic therapy. Nursing Actions Reduce risk of metritis:Educate the woman regarding proper hand washing techniques to reduce spread of bacteria. Instruct the woman in proper pericare and to wipe front to back. Instruct woman to change her peripads every 3 to4 hours or sooner because lochia is a medium for bacterialgrowth. Encourage early ambulation by explaining how ambula-tion reduces the risk of infection by promoting uterinedrainage. Encourage intake of fluids to rehydrate by explaining to the woman that maintaining adequate hydration can reduce her risk for infections. Woman should have a minimum fluid intake of 3,000 mL/day (James, 2008). Educate the woman on a diet high in protein and vitamin C,which aids in tissue healing.CRITICAL COMPONENT Postpartum Infections: Risk Reduction Good hand washing techniques by staff and patients Fluid intake of a minimum 3,000 mL per day, to rehydratethe woman from fluid loss during labor and birth Diet high in protein and vitamin C to assist in tissue healing Early ambulation to promote circulation and uterinedrainage Metritis Metritis is the most common postpartum infection. It is an infection of the endometrium, myometrium, and/or parame-trial tissue that usually starts at the placental site and spreadsto encompass the entire endometrium. Approximately 2% ofwomen who experience a vaginal birth and 15% of womenwho experience a cesarean birth develop metritis.3704_Ch14_357-374 16/09/13 10:17 AM Page 364CHAPTER 14 High-Risk Postpartum Nursing Care 365 Monitor for signs and symptoms of metritis.Report assessment data of possible metritis and abnormallaboratory reports to physician and/or midwife for furtherevaluation. Administer antibiotics as per orders. Provide pain management measures. Provide emotional support to the woman and her family. Discharge teachingProvide teaching on discharge medications. Provide information on signs and symptoms to report tohealth care provider. Cystitis Cystitis, an infection of the bladder, is a common occurrence in the postpartum period. Cystitis is easily treated, but if leftuntreated or if there is a delay in treatment, the woman is atrisk for pyelonephritis. Risk Factors Epidural anesthesia, which decreases the woman's abilityto feel the urge to void, leading to an increased risk for anoverdistended bladder Overdistended bladder or incomplete emptying of thebladder, which can cause an increase of bacterial growthin the bladder A Foley catheter inserted during the labor process Neonatal macrosomia, which can cause edema around theurethra Operative vaginal deliveries, forceps, or vacuum extractor,which can cause edema around the urethra Intrapartal vaginal exams and the birth process, whichcan contaminate the urethra with bacteria Assessment Findings Low-grade fever (< 38.5\u00b0C/101.3\u00b0F) Burning on urination Suprapubic pain Urgency to void Small, frequent voidings\u2014less than 150 mL per voiding Medical Management Urinalysis, CBC, and urine culture and sensitivity Antibiotics (usually PO) started before culture results Nursing Actions Risk reduction for cystitisAssist the woman to the bathroom to void within a fewhours after birth. This will flush bacteria out of the urethra. Catheterize the woman if she is unable to void within12 hours post-birth as per orders. Remind the woman to void every 3-4 hours; woman may notfeel urge to void during the first 24-48 hours following birth. Measure voidings for the first 24 hours, assessing for complete emptying of the bladder. Each voiding should be equal to or greater than 150 mL. Change peripads at least every 3-4 hours. Soiled peripadscan encourage growth of bacteria that can enter the urethra.Remind postpartum women to drink a minimum of 3,000 mL/day (AWHONN, 2006). Encourage foods that increase acidity in urine, such ascranberry juice, apricots, and plums. Monitor for signs and symptoms of cystitis.Report findings of possible urinary tract infection (UTI) tothe physician or CNM for further evaluation. Obtain laboratory specimens as per orders. Administer antibiotics as per orders. Discharge teachingProvide information on proper use of discharge medications. Provide information on signs and symptoms of cystitis toreport to the health care provider. Mastitis Mastitis is an inflammation/infection of the breast that is common among lactating women. It usually occurs in just one of the breasts and within the first 2 postpartum weeks after milk flow has been established. Infection resolves within24-48 hours of antibiotic therapy. Abscess formation canoccur in 10% of women who develop mastitis. Risk Factors History of mastitis with a previous infant Cracked and/or sore nipples Use of antifungal nipple cream, which is often appliedwhen the newborn has thrush. Assessment Findings A hard, tender palpable mass Redness in the area around the mass Acute pain in affected breast Temperature elevation Tachycardia Malaise Purulent drainage Medical Management Culture of expressed milk from affected breast Oral antibiotics therapy for 10-14 days Nursing Actions Risk reductionExplain to the woman the importance of washing herhands before feeding to decrease spread of bacteria. Proper hand washing technique by hospital personnel Teach the woman methods to decrease nipple irritationand tissue breakdown, such as correct infant latch on andremoval from the breast, and air-drying nipples after feedings (refer to Chapter 16 for additional information). Teach the woman the importance of a healthy diet andadequate fluids to decrease risk for any infection. Palpate and inspect the breasts for signs of mastitis.Report assessment data of possible mastitis to physician or CNM. Administer antibiotics as per orders. Administer analgesia as per orders.3704_Ch14_357-374 16/09/13 10:17 AM Page 365UNIT 4 Postpartal Period 366 Apply warm compresses to the affected area for comfortand promotion of circulation. Instruct the woman to continue to breastfeed or to mas-sage and express milk from the affected breast to promotecontinuation of milk flow. Explain to the woman that it is very common for lactat-ing women to experience mastitis and that it is easilytreated when identified early. Wound Infections Wound infections can occur at the episiotomy site, cesareanincision site, and laceration site. Risk Factors Obesity Diabetes Malnutrition Long labor Premature rupture of membranes Preexisting infection Immunodeficiency disorders Corticosteroid therapy Poor suturing technique Assessment Findings Erythema Redness Heat Swelling Tenderness Purulent drainage Low-grade fever Increased pain at incision or laceration site Medical Management Obtain a culture specimen from the wound or laceration. For mild to moderate wound infections that do not havepurulent drainage:Administer oral antibiotic therapy. Apply warm compresses to area. Wound infections with purulent drainage:Open and drain the wound. IV antibiotic therapy. Nursing Actions Assess perineum or surgical incision for REEDA. Informphysician or midwife of abnormal assessment data. Assess vital signs. Obtain laboratory specimens such as cultures as per orders. Review laboratory reports and notify the physician ormidwife of abnormal results. Administer antibiotics as per orders. Pain managementAdminister analgesia for fever and discomfort as per order. Apply hot packs for abdominal wounds or sitz bath forperineal wounds to promote comfort and circulation. Use proper hand washing technique before and after contact with the wound.Provide education on proper diet, fluids, and rest that candecrease the risk for infection and assist in the healingprocess. Provide information on proper use of discharge medications. POSTPARTUM PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS A women's psychological state is affected during the postpartumperiod by hormonal changes, lack of sleep, and stress of inte-grating a new person within the woman's life and within thefamily unit. A majority of women will experience postpartumblues, which are short term and require no medical intervention(see Chapter 13). Approximately 15% of women will experiencemajor mood disorders that have a profound effect on their abil-ity to care for themselves and/or their infants. Mood disordersduring the first year after childbirth have a negative effect on themother-infant relationship (AWHONN, 2006). Two majormood disorders are postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis. These disorders require management by mentalhealth care professionals. The primary role of the perinatal nurseis assessing for early signs of potential mood disorders andreporting these findings to the woman's health care provider forfurther evaluation and treatment. Evidence-Based Practice: Mother/Infant Skin-to-Skin Contact Bigelow, A., Power, M., MacLellan-Peters, Alex, M., and McDonald, C. (2012).Effects of mother/infant skin-to-skin contact on postpartum depressive symptoms and maternal physiological stress. JOGNN, 41, 369-382. The purpose of this longitudinal quasi-experimental study wasto examine the effects of mother/infant skin-to-skin contact(SSC) on the mothers' postpartum depressive symptoms first 3 postpartum months and their physiological stressduring the first postpartum month. The study included 30 mothers in the SSC group and 60 mothers in the control group. Mothers in the SSC groupprovided 5 hours per day of SSC with their infants in the firstweek postpartum and then more than 2 hours per day untilinfants were age 1 month. Mothers in the control group provided little or no SSC. Mothers completed self-reported depression scales at 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months of infant age. Salivary sam-ples were collected and assayed for cortisol. Results: Mothers in the SSC group had lower scores on the depression scales at 1 week and 1 month. There was no signif-icant difference at 2 and 3 months. During the first 4 weeks theSSC mothers had a greater reduction in their salivary cortisolthan mothers in the control group. Conclusion: Mother/infant SSC benefits mothers by reduc- ing their depressive symptoms and physiological stress duringthe first postpartum month. Postpartum Depression Postpartum depression (PPD) is a mood disorder charac-terized by severe depression that occurs within the first 6-12 months postpartum. PPD is classified as a major3704_Ch14_357-374 16/09/13 10:17 AM Page 366CHAPTER 14 High-Risk Postpartum Nursing Care 367 depressive disorder when the woman has a depressed moodor a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities for at least2 weeks plus four of the following symptoms: Significant weight loss or gain: a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month Insomnia or hypersomnia Changes in psychomotor activity: agitation or retardation Decreased energy or fatigue Feelings of worthlessness or guilt Decreased ability to concentrate; inability to make decisions Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide attempt (AmericanPsychiatric Association, 1994) It is estimated that this occurs in 14.5% of postpartumwomen (AWHONN, 2008). PPD has an effect on the woman, her partner, and otherchildren within the family unit. A major difference between postpartum blues and PPD isthat PPD is disabling; the woman is unable to safely carefor herself and/or her baby (Table 14-2). Women who receive proper treatment will recover fromPPD, but they grieve over the lost time with their infants(AWHONN, 2006). Risk Factors History of depression before pregnancy Depression or anxiety during pregnancy Inadequate social support Poor quality relationship with partner Life and child care stresses Complications of pregnancy and/or childbirth Assessment Findings Sleep and appetite disturbance Fatigue greater than expected for caring for a newborn Despondency Uncontrolled crying Anxiety, fear, and/or panic Inability to concentrate Feelings of guilt, inadequacy, and/or worthlessness Inability to care for self and/or baby Decreased affectionate contact with the infantDecreased responsiveness to the infant Thoughts of harming baby Thoughts of suicide Medical/Psychiatric Management Mild PPDInterpersonal psychotherapy (Yonkers et al., 2011) Moderate PPDInterpersonal psychotherapy Antidepressants (Yonkers et al., 2011) Severe PPD or suicidal ideationIntense psychiatric care Crisis interventions Interpersonal psychotherapy Antidepressants Electroconvulsive therapy (Yonkers et al., 2011) Nursing Actions Review prenatal record for risk factors. Monitor mother-infant interactions more closely forwomen at risk for PPD. Teach the woman and her partner signs of PPD thatshould be reported to her health care provider. Be supportive and encouraging in interactions. Provide the woman with information regarding postpar-tum support groups and other community resources toassist her with parenting issues and to provide support.Postpartum support by health care professionals can mitigate the onset of postpartum mood disorders(Yonkers, 2011). Postpartum Psychosis Postpartum psychosis (PPP) is a variant of bipolar disorderand is the most serious form of postpartum mood disorders.This is a rare postpartum mood disorder that occurs in 1-2 women per 1,000 births (AWHONN, 2006). Onset ofsymptoms can be as early as the third postpartum day.Women with PPP require immediate hospitalization andevaluation, as they are at risk for injuring themselves ortheir infants. Risk Factors Women with known bipolar disorder Personal or family history of bipolar disorder (Sit,Rotherschild, & Wisner, 2006) Assessment Findings Paranoia, grandiose or bizarre delusions usually associatedwith the baby Mood swings Extreme agitation Depressed or elated moods Distraught feelings about ability to enjoy infant Confused thinking Strange beliefs, such as that she or her infant must die Disorganized behavior (Engqvist et al., 2009; Sit et al., 2006)TABLE 14-2 MAJOR BETWEEN POSTPARTUMBLUES AND POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION POSTPARTUM BLUES POSTPARTUM DEPRESSIONSymptoms disappear without medical intervention. Occurs within the first 2 weeks postpartum. Able to safely care for self and baby.Requires psychiatric interventions. Occurs within the first 12 months postpartum. Unable to safely care for self and/or baby.3704_Ch14_357-374 16/09/13 10:17 AM Page 367UNIT 4 Postpartal Period 368 Medical/Psychiatric Management Hospitalization to the psychiatric unit Psychiatric evaluation Antidepressant and antipsychotic drug treatment Psychotherapy Electroconvulsive therapy Nursing Actions Review the prenatal record for risk factors. Educate women who are at risk and their support systemof early signs of PPP, such as mood swings, hallucina-tions, and strange beliefs, and instruct them to contactthe health care provider if symptoms are present.Early detection and treatment can prevent a major episode(Born, 2004).Paternal Postnatal Depression The majority of new fathers experience feelings of happinessand excitement, but some will experience depression. Paternalpostnatal depression (PPND) is estimated to occur in 1%-8% ofnew fathers during the first 6 months following childbirth (seeCritical Component: Paternal Postnatal Depression [PPND]).During the first few months of postpartum, the man'stestosterone levels decrease and estrogen levels increase.Lower levels of testosterone are linked with depression in men. Signs and symptoms are not as apparent as they are withmaternal PPD.The man may withdraw from social interactions. The man may be cynical in his interactions and experienceirritable moods. PROFESSIONAL POSITION STATEMENT: AWHONN POSITION STATEMENT ON THE ROLE OF THE NURSE IN POSTPARTUM MOOD AND ANXIETY DISORDERS PositionHealth care facilities that serve pregnant women, new mothers,and newborns should have r o utine screening protocols and educational mechanisms for staff training and client educationrelated to postpartum mood and anxiety disorders.BackgroundPostpartum depression (PPD) is a catchall phrase for many emo-tional symptoms associat ed with pr egnancy and childbirth. The literature has several obsessive compulsive disorder; postpartum panicdisorder; postpartum II disorder, the postpartum depression impostor; andpostpartum depression. Postpartum mood and anxiety disorders affect the whole fam- ily. The mother-infant relationship is often adversely affected. Amother's postpartum mood and anxiety disorder can negativelyinfluence her infant's cognitive, social, and emotional develop-ment; in some cases this impact may extend into early and middlechildhood. Depressive symptoms are also associated with earlycessation of breastfeeding. Additionally, the relationship betweenthe father/partner and mother may be strained. Postpartum depression, specifically, is a non-psychotic depressive episode that begins in the postpartum period,includes at least 2 weeks of depressed mood or loss of interest inalmost all activities, and at least four of the following symptoms:changes in appetite or weight, sleep, and psychomotor activity;decreased energy; feelings of worthlessness or guilt; difficultythinking, concentrating, making decisions; or recurrentthoughts of death or suicidal ideation, plans, or attempts.Incidence rates for major and minor postpartum depressioncombined are estimated at up to 14.5%.Role of NursesRegistered nurses and members of the multidisciplinary healthcare t eam working with pregnant women and new mothers can optimize the level of service they provide postpartum women by: Obtaining knowledge about the distinctions among postpar-tum mood and anxiety disorders to differentiate postpartumdepression from other mental health illnesses occurring afterbirth; Familiarizing themselves with the risk factors associated withpostpartum mood and anxiety and disorders, including prenatal depression, child care stress, life stress, lack of social support, prenatal anxiety, maternity blues, marital dissatisfaction, history of previous depression, difficult infant temperament, low self-esteem, low socioeconomic status,unplanned/unwanted pregnancy, single marital status, pretermbirth and multiple births; Recognizing the symptoms for the spectrum of postpartummood and anxiety disorders ranging from \"baby blues\" to life-threatening postpartum psychoses; Gaining a thorough knowledge of the screening methodologiesthat help identify women at risk for developing postpartummood and anxiety disorders; Being knowledgeable about the range of treatment options avail-able for the variety of postpartum mood and anxiety disorders; Providing women and their families/support systems withresource materials that include appropriate referral informa-tion for the treatment of postpartum mood and anxiety disorders; referral information for the treatment of postpar-tum mood and anxiety disorders; Educating women about the myth that equates motherhoodwith total happiness and fulfillment; Encouraging women to engage in a dialogue with a health careprovider about any negative feelings they may be experiencingduring pregnancy or after the birth of a child. Nurses serve a vital role in maximizing the health and health care experiences of pregnant women and new mothers. Newmothers often perceive the following nursing themes to be caringand helpful in their diagnosis and recovery: Having sufficient knowledge about postpartum mood and anxiety disorders that result in a quick, correct diagnosis Using astute observations and intuition that lead to an aware-ness that something might be wrong with a mother Providing hope that the mothers' postpartum mood or anxietydisorder will end3704_Ch14_357-374 16/09/13 368CHAPTER 14 High-Risk Postpartum Nursing Care 369 The man may demonstrate avoidance behaviors such asspending more time away from the family. The man's affect may appear to be anxious or mad versus sad. PPND has a negative effect on the couple's relationshipand on the father-child relationship. PPND can have a long-term negative effect on the mental well-being of the child (Melrose, 2010). Risk Factors Maternal PPD: this is the primary risk factor. Depressive symptoms during pregnancy Unplanned and/or unexpected pregnancy Baby with health or feeding problems Lack of social support Excessive stress about becoming a father Pre-existing mental health disorder Stressful life event, e.g., death of his parent (Bradley &Slade, 2011). Assessment Findings Irritable Overwhelmed Frustrated Indecisive Avoidance of social situations Cynical Alcohol: increased consumptionDrug use Domestic violence Medical Management Interpersonal psychotherapy Antidepressant medications Nursing Actions Provide information on PPND to the man and his partner. Stress the importance of seeking professional help if he isexperiencing symptoms of PPND.Explain that PPND can have negative long-term effectson his child.PROFESSIONAL POSITION STATEMENT: AWHONN POSITION STATEMENT ON THE ROLE OF THE NURSE IN POSTPARTUM MOOD AND ANXIETY DISORDERS\u2014cont'd Sharing valuable time Making the appropriate referrals so that the mother is startedon the right path to recovery Making an extra effort to provide continuity of care for themother Understanding what the mother is experiencing Screening and TreatmentScreening mechanisms for potential risks for postpartum moodand anxiety disorder s should begin during a woman's pr enatal care. In fact, screening should not be limited to the postpartumor prenatal periods but should be available for women across thelife span with incorporation possible in annual well women carevisits. Health care providers can prepare women and their fami-lies with information on risk factors by educating them on thesymptoms, providing valuable educational materials, andarranging for follow-up mechanisms, including phone callsand/or home visits to track their progress after giving birth. A significant factor in the duration of postpartum mood and anxiety disorders is the length of delay to adequate treatment.Many new mothers are reluctant to admit that they are not experiencing motherhood's idealized standard of perfection,complicating the ability to express all of their feelings\u2014includingnegative emotions\u2014about their role as mothers. While postpartum depression usually appears in the first 3 months postpartum, it can occur any time during the first 12 months after delivery; therefore, screening mechanismsshould be available in all health care facilities where new motherstypically may be, including obstetric, neonatal, and pediatric set-tings. Even if a new mother screens negatively for PPD in the earlypostpartum months, she may develop PPD sometime later thefirst year after the birth of her baby. Extreme postpartum mooddisorders such as postpartum psychosis can be life threateningfor mothers and newborns; therefore, the importance of appro-priate screening and early intervention strategies cannot be over-stated. If a woman is contemplating her death or contemplatingharming her infant, immediate formal mental health interven-tions are necessary.

CRITICAL COMPONENT Paternal Postnatal Depression (PPND) PPND often goes undiagnosed and untreated due to: The man or health care provider failing to recognize signsand symptoms of PPND. Lack of guidelines for assessing and treating PPND. The man downplaying the degree to which the symptomsaffect his life and relationships. The man being reluctant to discuss his depression symptomswith friends, family, or health care professionals. The man resisting mental health treatment; worried aboutstigma of depression. Few programs existing that address PPND.3704_Ch14_357-374 16/09/13 10:17 AM Page 369UNIT 4 Postpartal Period 370 Problem No. 1: Fluid volume deficit (isotonic) Goal: Increase fluid volume Outcome: The woman's blood pressure and heart rate will be within normal ranges, and intake and output will be within200 mL of each other by the end of the shift.

You areassigned Mallory Polk, a 42-year-old African American woman.(Refer to Tying It All Together in Chapters 7 and 10 for antepar-tum and intrapartum data.) Summary of Labor and Delivery RecordMallory was admitted 2 days ago at 32 weeks' gestation and managed in the birthing unit for preterm labor with magnesiumsulfate and antibiotics. She received betamethasone. The mag-nesium sulfate was discontinued 3 hours before delivery. Herlabor was augmented during the transitional phase. She spon-taneously delivered a 1559-gram (3 lb., 7 oz.) boy with Apgarscores of 5 and 7 at 1 and 5 minutes. Her baby is experiencingmild signs of respiratory distress and is in the NICU. Postpartum ReportMallory is 4 hours post-birth and has an IV of D 5W lactated Ringer's solution with 10 units of oxytocin running in her leftarm. She voided in the recovery unit 2 hours post-birth. Assessment Findings Vitals signs: Temperature 37\u00b0C; pulse 98 14 breaths/min; pressure 110/70 mm Hg Fundus is at the umbilicus and boggy.Lochia is heavy.Based on your assessment findings and Mallory's history, what are your immediate nursing actions? Discuss the rationale for your nursing actions. You reevaluate Mallory 10 minutes after your initial nursing actions. Her fundus is firm, midline, and 1 finger breadth belowthe umbilicus with scant lochia. You continue to monitorMallory and 15 minutes later her fundus is boggy with heavylochia. The fundus becomes firm after massage. Her pulse is100 bpm and blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg. You notify herCNM and report your findings.Detail the aspects of your assessment findings that you will report to the CNM. The CNM orders 20 units of oxytocin in 1,000 mL of lactat- ed Ringer's solution. The ordered infusion rate is 10 mL/min, tobe regulated by firmness of the uterus.Discuss your nursing actions and rationale for actions.Discuss the assessment data needed to determine effectiveness of medical and nursing actions.

During these few weeks, the neonate transitionsfrom intrauterine to extrauterine life and adapts to a newenvironment. Most neonates who are term and whosemothers experienced a healthy pregnancy and low-risklabor and birth accomplish this transition with relative ease(Fig. 15-1). The focus of nursing care during this time is to protect and support the neonate as he undergoes numerous physiological changes and adapts to extrauterine life. Thisis accomplished by:Maintaining body heat Maintaining respiratory function Decreasing risk for infection Assisting parents in providing appropriate nutrition andhydration Assisting parents in learning to care for their newborn TRANSITION TO EXTRAUTERINE LIFE The transition to extrauterine life begins at birth when theumbilical cord is clamped and the neonate takes his firstbreath. This initiates various changes within the neonate'sphysiological systems. Each system needs to adapt to thechanges that occur during this transition. The most criticaland dynamic changes occur in the respiratory and cardio-vascular systems. Thermoregulatory, metabolic, hepatic,gastrointestinal, renal, and immune systems also undergosignificant changes. The Respiratory System The establishment of extrauterine respirations is the mostcritical and immediate physiological change that occurs in thetransition from fetus to neonate. This change is initiated bycompression of the thorax, lung expansion, increase in alveo-lar oxygen concentration, and vasodilatation of the pulmonaryvessels.Mechanical and chemical stimuli are the primary factors that initiate extrauterine respirations (Figs. 15-2 and 15-3). Sensory stimuli such as exposure to temperature changes,sounds, lights, and touch also influence respirations bystimulating the respiratory center of the medulla. In utero, the lungs are filled with amniotic fluid.Approximately 30 mL of amniotic fluid is forced out of the lungs during the delivery process. Figure 15-1 Neonate transitioning to extrauterine life. Delivery of f ace Loss of variable amounts of amniotic fluid from lungs Entry of air into alveoli replacing the expelled amniotic fluid Lung fluid is reabsorbed lymphatic athor acic positive pressure remain openDelivery of chest Expansion of chest to predelivery proportions Negative pressure P assive inspir ation of air First breath Cessation of placental b lood flow Decreased O 2 Mild hypoxia Increase of carbon dioxide Decrease of pH (acidosis) to stimuli.3704_Ch15_375-416 03/10/13 2:51 PM Page 376CHAPTER 15 Physiological and Behavioral Responses of the Neonate 377 The presence of surfactant, a phospholipid, within thealveoli assists in the establishment of functional residualcapacity. This residual capacity assists in keeping thealveolar sacs partially open at the end of exhalation,which decreases the amount of pressure and energyrequired on inspiration (see Chapter 17). The initiation of respiration has an effect on the pul-monary circulation and gas exchange:First breath alveolar oxygen tension (Pa O2) and arterial pH dilation of pulmonary arteries pulmonary vascular resistance blood flow through pulmonary vessels oxygen and carbon dioxideexchange within the lungs Two factors that negatively affect the transition toextrauterine respirations are:Decreased surfactant levels related to immature lungs Persistent hypoxemia and acidosis that leads to constrictionof the pulmonary arteries Approximately 10% of neonates require some degree ofassistance with respirations at the time of delivery, and1% require extensive resuscitation (see CriticalComponent: Signs of Respiratory Distress). atrial pressure is higher than the right atrial pressure.This closure occurs when:Increased Pa O2decreased pulmonary pressure increased pulmonary blood flow increased pressure in left atrium closure of foramen ovale Significant neonatal hypoxia can cause a reopening of theforamen ovale The ductus arteriosus, which connects the pulmonary artery with the descending aorta, usually closes within 15 hours post-birth.This closure occurs when the pulmonary vascular resistancebecomes less than system vascular resistance left to right shunt closure of ductus arteriosus. It will remain open if lungs fail to expand or Pa O2 levels drop. The Thermoregulatory System The fetus is surrounded in amniotic fluid that maintains afairly constant environmental temperature based on thematernal body temperature. Once the neonate enters theextrauterine world, he must adapt to changes in the environ-mental temperatures. The neonate's responses to extrauterinetemperature changes during the first few weeks are delayedand place the neonate at risk for cold stress. Figure 15-4 Transition to neonatal circulation.CRITICAL COMPONENT Signs of Respiratory Distress Cyanosis Abnormal respiratory pattern such as apnea and tachypnea Retractions of the chest wall Grunting Flaring of nostrils Hypotonia The Circulatory System The transition from fetal circulation to neonatal circulationbegins rapidly within seconds of the clamping of the umbilicalcord and the initiation of the first breath. The transition toneonatal circulation is strongly influenced by the changeswithin the respiratory system. Fetal circulation is discussed inChapter 3.The decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance causes anincrease in pulmonary blood flow, and the increase in systemic vascular resistance influences the cardiovascularchanges (Fig. 15-4).The three major fetal circulatory structures that undergo changes are the ductus venosus, foramen ovale, and the ductusarteriosus.The ductus venosus, the umbilical vein to the inferior vena cava, closes by day 3 of life andbecomes a ligament. Blood flow through the umbilicalvein stops once the cord is clamped. The foramen ovale, which is an opening between the right atrium and the left atrium, closes when the left Clamping of umbilical cord Remov al of placental circulation Increase in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) Reversal of b lood flow Closure of ductus arteriosusClosure of ductus venosus Entry of air into alveoli Expansion of lungs Po 2 levels Decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) Increase in pulmonary blood flow Increase in left atrium pressure and a decrease in right atrium pressureClosure of foramen ovale3704_Ch15_375-416 03/10/13 2:51 PM Page 377UNIT Period 378 The neonate responds to cold by: An increase in metabolic rate, An increase of muscle activity, Peripheral vascular constriction, and Metabolism of brown fat. Neutral thermal environment (NTE) is an environmentthat maintains body temperature with minimal metabolicchanges and/or oxygen consumption.A neutral thermal environment (NTE) decreases possiblecomplications related to the delayed response to environ-mental temperature changes. Brown adipose tissue (BAT), also referred to as brownfat or nonshivering thermogenesis, is a highly dense andvascular adipose tissue. Neonates possess large amountsof BAT, while children and adults have smaller amounts(Blackburn, 2012).BAT is located in the neck, thorax, axillary area,intrascapular areas, and around the adrenal glands and kidneys. BAT promotes: An increase in metabolism Heat production Heat transfer to the peripheral system (Blackburn,2012) Heat is produced by intense lipid metabolic metabolism of BAT. BAT reserves are rapidly depleted during periods of cold stress. Preterm neonates have limited BAT. Neonates are at higher risk for thermoregulatory problems related to:Higher body surface-area-to-body-mass ratio Higher metabolic rate Limited and immature thermoregulatory abilities Factors that negatively affect thermoregulation are:Decreased subcutaneous fat Decreased BAT in preterm neonates Large body surfaceLoss of body heat from convection, radiation, conduction,and/or evaporation (Fig. 15-5): Evaporation: Loss of heat that occurs when water on the neonate's skin is conver ted to vapors, such as dur- ing bathing or directly after birth Conduction: Tr ansfer of heat to cooler surface by direct skin contact, such as cold hands of caregivers or coldequipment Convection: Loss of heat fr om the neonate's warm body sur face to cooler air currents, such as air condi- tioners or oxygen masks Radiation: Tr ansfer of heat from the neonate to cooler objects that are not in direct contact with the neonate,such as cold walls of the isolette or cold equipmentnear the neonate Cold Stress Cold stress is a term that describes excessive heat loss that leads to hypothermia and results in the utilization of compen-satory mechanisms to maintain the neonate's body tempera-ture (Fig. 15-6). Cold stress occurs when there is:A decrease in environmental temperatures a decrease in the neonate's body temperature an increase in respiratory rate, heart rate an increase in oxygen consumption, a depletion of glucose, and a decrease in surfactant respiratory distress Cold stress can delay the transition from fetal to neonatalcirculation.

Remove wet blankets from the neonate's direct environ-ment to decrease heat loss due to radiation, evaporation,and conduction. Place a stocking cap on the neonate's head to decrease heatloss due to radiation and convection (Fig. 15-7). Skin-to-skin contact with the mother with a warm blan-ket over the mother and neonate decreases heat loss due toradiation and conduction. Use pre-warmed blankets and clothing to decrease heat lossdue to conduction.Swaddle in warm blankets to decrease heat loss due to convection and radiation. Pre-warm radiant warmers and heat shields to decreaseheat loss due to conduction. Delay initial bath until the neonate's temperature is stableto decrease heat loss due to evaporation. Place the neonate away from air vents to decrease heat lossdue to convection. Place the neonate away from outside walls and windowsto decrease heat loss due to convection radiation. Maintain a NTE to decrease heat loss due to convectionand radiation. Actions when the neonate displays signs/symptoms ofcold stressPlace a stocking cap on the neonate's head. Skin-to-skin contact with the mother with a warm blanket over both the mother and neonate when there is amild decrease in temperature; reassess temperature as perinstitutional protocol. Swaddle in warm blankets; reassess temperature as perinstitutional protocol, which is generally every 30 minutesuntil stable. Place the naked neonate under a preheated radiant warmer. Attach the servo-controlled probe on the neonate'sabdomen or other body surf ace that is closest to the radiant source. It is recommended not to place probe over BAT areas,but there are too few research studies to view this as evidenced-based practice (Blackburn, 2012). Set the control to 36.5\u00b0C. Monitor the neonate's temperature, respiratory rate,and hear t r ate every 5 minutes when rewarming. Assess and adjust the neonate's fluid requirement; fl uids may need to be increased to compensate for insatiable water loss. Monitor temperature as per institutional protocol. Obtain a heel stick to assess for hypoglycemia (glucose <40 mg/dL). Treat hypoglycemia.Neonate's temper ature equal to or less than 36\u00b0C/97.6\u00b0F Non-shivering thermogenesis (Metabolism of Brown F at) Increased metabolic r ate Increased O 2 consumption Increased respir atory r ateIncreased caloric consumption Decreased glycogen distress Figure 15-6 Cold stress. Figure 15-7 Stocking cap is placed on the neonate's head to reduce heat loss due to radiation and convection. 3704_Ch15_375-416 03/10/13 2:51 PM Page 379UNIT 5 Neonatal Period 380 The Metabolic System Large quantities of glycogen are stored by the fetus duringpregnancy in preparation for meeting energy requirementswhen transitioning from intrauterine to extrauterine life.Immediately after birth, the neonate becomes independent ofthe mother's metabolism and must balance the amount ofinsulin production with glucose availability.Glucose values normally decrease about 1 hour post-birth, and then values rise and stabilize by 2 to 3 hourspost-birth (Blackburn, 2012). Optimal range for plasma glucose is 70-100 mg/dL. Hypoglycemia (blood glucose level under 40 mg/dL inthe neonate) is common during this transitional time,especially in neonates of diabetic mothers (see CriticalComponent: Hypoglycemia).During intrauterine life, neonates of diabetic mothers pro-duce high levels of insulin in response to the high levels ofcirculating maternal glucose. During the first few hours ofextrauterine life, the neonate's insulin level remains higherthan normal, leading to hypoglycemia.The Hepatic System Functions of the liver include:Carbohydrate metabolismThe liver regulates the blood glucose levels by: Converting excessive glucose to glycogen (insulin andcortisol f acilitate this process) Converting glycogen to glucose when glucose levelsare low . Amino acid metabolism Lipid metabolism Synthesis of plasma proteins Blood coagulationCoagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X are synthesized inthe liver. Vitamin K influences the activation of these factors.During intrauterine life, the fetus receives vitamin K fromhis mother. After birth, the neonate experiences a decreasein vitamin K and is at risk for delayed clotting and forhemorrhage. Vitamin K is synthesized in the intestinal flora, which isabsent in the newborn. The intestinal flora develops afterthe introduction of microorganisms, which usually occurswith the first feedings. A vitamin K injection is given as a prophylaxis todecrease the risk of bleeding related to vitamin K deficiency. The decline of maternally acquired vitamin K levels isgreater in breastfed neonates, neonates with a history who are onwarfarin (Blackburn, 2012). Conjugation of bilirubinThere is an increase in the neonate's RBC turnover(shorter RBC life span) and an increased RBC count atbirth. These factors contribute to a proportionally greateramount of bilirubin production. There are two forms of bilirubin: indirect and direct. Indirect bilirubin (unconjugated bilirubin), a fat-soluble substance, is produced from the breakdown of red blood cells(RBCs). It is converted to direct bilirubin (conjugated bilirubin), a water-soluble substance, by liver enzymes.Direct bilirubin is in a form that can be excreted in theurine and stool. Hyperbilirubinemia is a condition in which there is a high level of unconjugated bilirubin in the neonate'sblood related to the immature liver function, high RBCcount that is common in neonates, and an increasedhemolysis caused by the shorter life span of fetal RBCs(see Chapter 17 for information on hyperbilirubinemia/jaundice). Phagocytosis by Kupffer cells (macrophages) Storage of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K and ironThe formation of new RBCs is suppressed during the firstfew weeks post-birth. During this time the liver stores ironfrom destroyed RBCs. This iron is used when RBC forma-tion is resumed (Blackburn, 2012).CRITICAL COMPONENT Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is defined as a blood glucose level <40 mg/dL inthe neonate.Risks for Hypoglycemia Neonates of diabetic mothers Neonates weighing >4,000 grams or large for gestational age Post-term Preterm neonates Small for infection Respiratory distress Neonatal and Symptoms Jitteriness Hypotonia Irritability Apnea Lethargy Temperature instability Nursing Actions Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. Assess blood glucose level with use of glucose monitor. Assist the woman with breastfeeding. Feed the neonate either formula or dextrose water when the glucose level is <40 mg/dL as per institutionalprotocol, generally 5 mL/kg. Maintain NTE to decrease risk of cold stress.3704_Ch15_375-416 03/10/13 2:51 PM Page 380CHAPTER 15 Physiological and of the Neonate 381 DetoxificationThe smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) of the liver produces enzymes that detoxify harmful substances such asmedications (Blackburn, 2012). The neonate has a reduced number of SER decreased ability to detoxify medication risk of toxic effects frommedications. Constipation usually does not occur in breastfedneonates. Constipation can occur in bottle-fed infants when formula is not properly diluted. The Renal System Two major functions of the kidneys are control of fluid andelectrolyte balance and excretion of metabolic waste. Duringfetal life, these functions are assumed by the placenta. Oncethe cord is clamped, the neonate's kidneys must take on thesefunctions. Initially the neonate's kidneys are immature and place theneonate at risk for:Over-hydration Dehydration Electrolyte disorders such as hyponatremia and hyperna-tremia (Blackburn, 2012) There is higher risk for complications for preterm neonates. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is initially low in theneonate but doubles by 2 weeks of age (Blackburn, 2012).Decreased GFR ability to excrete water risk of over-hydration and water intoxication Dehydration can occur due to the neonate's kidneys' lim-ited ability to concentrate urine. The limited abilities of the kidneys can affect the excre-tion of drugs from the neonate's systems and increase therisk of side effects and toxicity 2012). Full-term neonates excrete 15-60 mL/kg of urine perday few days of life. Urinary output increasesMedication Phytonadione (Vitamin K, AquaMEPHYTON) Indication: Prevention of hemorrhagic disease in neonate Action: Vitamin K is required for the hepatic synthesis ofblood coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X. Common side effects: Erythema, pain, and swelling at injec-tion site Route and dose: IM; 0.5-1 mg within 1 hour of birth (Data Vallerand & Sanoski, 2013) The Gastrointestinal System The neonate's gastrointestinal system is functionally immaturebut rapidly adapts to demands for growth and developmentthrough ingestion, digestion, and absorption of nutrients, aswell as eliminations of waste.Gastric capacity for the first few days is approximately 5-10 mL and increases to 60 mL by day 7. Stomach emptying time is 2-4 hours.Neonates should feed every 2-4 hours. Neonates may appear uninterested in feeding during thefirst few days.Decreased interest during this time may be related to aquiet sleep state. The characteristics of stools and stool pattern varydepending on the type, frequency, and amount of feedingand the age of the neonate (Table 15-1). The types ofstools are:Meconium stool begins to form during the 4th gestational month and is the first stool eliminated by the neonate. It issticky, thick, black, and odorless. It is first passed within24-48 hours. Transitional stool begins around the 3rd day and can con-tinue for 3 or 4 days. The stool transitions from black togreenish black, to greenish brown, to greenish yellow. Thisphase of stool characteristics occurs in both breastfed stool is yellow and semiformed. Later itbecomes a golden yellow with a pasty consistency and has a sour odor. Formula-fed stool is drier and more formed than breast- feed stools. It is a paler yellow or brownish yellow and hasan unpleasant odor. Diarrheal stool is loose and green. Breastfed neonates tend to have more stools per day thando formula-fed neonates. It is not uncommon for theneonate to pass 4-8 stools per day.TABLE 15-1 MINIMUM NUMBER OF WET DIAPERS AND STOOLS DURING FIRST MONTH NUMBER NEONATE'S OF WET NUMBER TYPE OF AGE DIAPERS OF STOOLS STOOLDay 1 1 1 Meconium - sticky, thick and black Day 2 2 3 Meconium - sticky, thick and black Day 3 5-6 3 Transitional - looser greenishblack-greenish brown Day 4 6 3 Yellow, soft, watery Day 5 6 3 Breastfed stool 1 month Period 382 to 250-400 mL by end of the first month of life(Blackburn, 2012).A delay or decrease in urinary output can occur in neonateswhose mothers received magnesium sulfate during labor.Magnesium sulfate blocks neuromuscular transmissionsand can cause urinary retention (Blackburn, 2012). Neonates usually lose 5%-10% of birth weight during thefirst week of life due to diuresis. The Immune System The immune system protects the body from invasion by for-eign materials such as bacteria and viruses (Scanlon &Sanders, 2011). Before rupture of membranes, the fetus livesin the sterile environment of the maternal uterus and relies onthe maternal immune system to protect him from pathogenicorganisms. During the transition from extrauterine life, theneonate begins the process of developing normal microbialflora and must respond to colonization by potential patho-genic bacteria (Blackburn, 2012). Major components of the immune system:Active humoral immunity is the process in which B cellsdetect antigens and produce antibodies against them.Active humoral immunity is further classified as: Acquired immunity that develops from vaccination Natural immunity that develops from exposure to anti-gens, af t er which the individual produces antibodies Passive immunity, which is not permanent, is acquiredeither naturally or artificially. An example of natural passive immunity is the placentaltransmission of antibiotics fr om the mother to the fetus. This provides protection for the neonate duringthe first few months of life from the pathogens towhich the mother has been exposed. An example of artificial passive immunity is gamma globu-lin, which pr ovides immediat e protection for a short time. Lymphocytes are white blood cells that are primarily composed of T cells and B cells. The number of T cells within the neonate's system iscomparable to that in adults, but their functional abili-ties ar e decreased, which delays the response to microorganisms (Blackburn, 2012). The functional abilities of B cells are also hyporespon-sive (Blackburn, 2012). Immunoglobulins are classified as IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD,and IgE (Table 15-2). Maternal IgGs are the primary antibodies that cross theplacenta and ent er the fetal system and provide passive immunity for the neonate (Blackburn, 2012). The maternal transfer of IgG antibodies protects theneonate fr om bacterial and vir al infections for which the mother has developed antibodies, such as rubella,tetanus, and diphtheria (Blackburn, 2012). Neonates are at risk for infection related to:Immature defense mechanism Lack of experience with and exposure to organisms, whichleads to a delayed response to antigensBreakdown of skin and mucous membranes that provides aportal of entry for bacteria (Blackburn, 2012) During the transitional period, the neonate's immunesystem begins to:Develop normal microbial flora of the skin, respiratorytract, and gastrointestinal tract Respond to bacterial colonization of potential pathogens(Blackburn, 2012) Neonates are first exposed to organisms from the mater-nal genital tract during the birthing process.The maternal genital tract may contain group BStreptococcus and E. coli, which can result in neonatal sepsis (see Chapter 17). NEONATAL ASSESSMENT A neonatal assessment should be done within 2 hours afterbirth. This initial assessment provides the baseline data forthe neonate and assists in determining the course of nursingand medical care.TABLE 15-2 CLASSES OF IMMUNOGLOBULINS NAMEIgG Sanders (2011).LOCATIONBloodExtracellular luid External secretions (tears, salvia, etc.) Blood B lymphocytesMast cells or basophilsFUNCTIONCrosses the placenta to provide passive immu-nity for newborns Provides long-t erm immunity afterrecovery or a vaccine Present in breast milk to provide passiveimmunity for breast-fed infants Found in secretions of all mucus membranes Produced first by the maturing immunesystem of infants Produced first during an infection (IgGproduction follows) Part of the ABO blood group Receptors on B lymphocytes Important in allergic reaction (mast cellsrelease histamine)3704_Ch15_375-416 03/10/13 2:51 PM Page 382CHAPTER 15 Physiological and Behavioral Responses of the Neonate 383 Preparation for Assessment Gather the equipment needed for the assessment: Latex gloves, measuring tape, infant stethoscope, thermometer, scale for weighing, and documentationrecords. Ensure that assessment is done in a NTE (i.e., close doorsto prevent drafts and regulate room temperature). (SeeCritical Component: Methods of Reducing Heat Loss.) Inform the parents of the assessment and invite them towatch. This is especially helpful for new fathers whenthe initial assessment is done in the labor/delivery/recovery room. General Survey Review the prenatal record and birth record for factorsthat could place the neonate at risk for complications.Examples of risk factors are:Maternal malnutrition prior to and/or during pregnancy Maternal age younger than 16 and older than 35 yearsChronic maternal illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy Labor and birth before 38 weeks of gestation Long labor: Greater than 24 hours Operative delivery: Use of forceps or vacuum extractor Medications during labor that have an effect on the cen-tral nervous system (CNS; e.g., magnesium sulfate andanalgesia/anesthesia) Prolonged rupture of membranes (longer than 24 hours) Meconium-stained amniotic fluid Placental abnormalities Apgar score 7 or below at 5 minutes Complete a general survey of the neonate before thehead-to-toe assessment.Observe the respiratory pattern and assess respirations andbreath sounds. It will become more difficult to assess respiratory rateonce the neonate responds (cries) to being handledduring the assessment. Observe posture. Assess the skin for color, birth trauma, and birthmarks. Observe the level of alertness/activity. Assess muscle tone and posture. The complete assessment begins after this initial overallobservation. Neonatal Assessment by Area/System See Tables 15-3, 15-4, and 15-5. Gestational Age Assessment Gestational age assessment of the newborn is based on themother's menstrual history, prenatal ultrasonography,and/or neonatal maturational examination. The calculationCRITICAL COMPONENT Methods of Reducing Heat Loss The thermoregulatory systems of neonates respond more slowlyto external temperature changes than those of adults.Prevention of heat loss is critical when doing assessments.Methods to reduce heat loss during assessments are: Ensure that the room is warm and free of air drafts. Place the infant under a warming unit to help maintain aNTE orassess the neonate in the mother's arms. Skin-to-skin contact between the mother and neonate can decrease theamount of heat loss. When doing assessments in an open crib or in a parent'sarms, keep the neonate wrapped and expose only the bodyarea that is being assessed.

Measurement is usually record- ed in centimeters. Measure by placing tape around the chest over the nipple line. Measure the length of body by securing tape on a flat surface. Place the top of neonate's head at the top of the tape. Extend the body and one leg.Measurement is taken from the top of the head to the bottomof the heel. Clean scale before use.Place clean paper on the scale.Set the scale at zero.Place the naked neonate on the scale. Record the neonate's weight.Do not leave the neonate unat- tended while weighing. Place a clean temperature probe in the axillary area. Axillary temperatures are pre- ferred because of the oftissue perforation,and (12-13 less than head circumference 45-53 cm (19-21 inches) 2,500-4,000 g (5 lbs. 8 oz.-8 lbs. 13 oz.) Weight loss of 5%-10% of birth weight during the first week isnormal. This is due to waterloss through urine, stools, andlungs and an increase in meta-bolic rate. It is also related tolimited fluid intake. The neonate will regain birth weight within 10 days 36.5\u00b0-37.2\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0-99\u00b0F) Axillary Microcephaly: Head circum- fornewborns gestational age.This is often related to con-genital malformation,maternal drug or alcoholingestion, or maternal circum- ference is >90th percentile.This can be related tohydrocephalus. Molding may interfere with accurate assessment oflength. Neonates whose length is <45 cm should be furtherassessed for causes such asintrauterine growth restric-tion or prematurity. Weight above the 90th percentile are common inneonates of diabetic mothers. Weight below the 10th percentile is due to prema-turity, intrauterine growthrestriction, malnutritionduring the pregnancy.

The amount of lanugo decreases as the fetus ages. Often seen on the neonate's back, shoulders, and forehead. A protective substance secreted from sebaceous glands that covered thefetus during pregnancy It looks like a whitish cheesy substance.May be noted in auxiliary areas and genital areas of full-term neonates. Yellow coloring of skin.First appears on the face and extends to the trunk and eventually the entire body. Best assessed in natural lighting.When jaundice is suspected, the nurse can apply gentle pressure to the skinover a firm surface such as nose, fore-head, or sternum. The skin blanches toa yellowish hue.Gradually falls out.The presence and amount of lanugo assist in estimating gestational age. Abundant lanugo may be a sign of prematurity or genetic disorder. The presence and amount of vernix assist in estimating gestational age. Full-term neonates usually have none or small amounts of vernix. Jaundice within the first 24 hours is pathological; usually related to prob-lem of the liver (see Chapter 17). Jaundice occurring after 24 hours is referred to as physiological jaundiceand is related to increased amountof unconjugated bilirubin in the system (see Chapter 17). 3704_Ch15_375-416 03/10/13 2:51 PM Page 392CHAPTER 15 Physiological and Behavioral Responses of the Neonate 393 TABLE 15-4 COMMON NEWBORN CHARACTERISTICS\u2014cont'd CHARACTERISTIC APPEARANCE SIGNIFICANCE MOLDING CAPUT SUCCEDANEUM CEPHALHEMATOMA EPSTEIN'S PEARLSElongation of the fetal head as it adapts to the birth canal A localized soft tissue edema of the scalp It feels \"spongy\" and can cross suture lines.

The Dubowitz neurological exam is a standardized tool that assesses 33 responses in four areas:Habituation (the response to repetitive light and sound stimuli) Movement and muscle tone Reflexes Neurobehavioral items The Ballard Maturational Score (BMS) is calculated by assessing the physical and neuromuscular maturity of theneonate. It can be completed in less time than theDubowitz neurological exam. It consists of six evaluationareas for neuromuscular maturity and six items ofobserved physical maturity (Table 15-6). The examina-tion determines weeks of gestation and classifies preterm (<37 weeks), term (37-42 weeks), orpost-term (>42 weeks). The scores from these exams provide a gestational age that is graphed based on weight, length, and head circumference to determine if the neonate is average for gestational age (AGA), small for gestationalage (SGA), or large for gestational age (LGA) (Fig. 15-8). SGA is a term used for neonates whose weight is below the 10th percentile for gestational age. LGA is a term used for neonates whose weight is above the 90th percentile for gestational age. Pain Assessment Neonates are subjected to a variety of painful stimuli duringtheir transition to extrauterine life (e.g., injections, heel sticksfor blood samples, and circumcision). In the past, health careproviders believed that neonates did not experience the sensa-tion of pain, so little attention was given to assessing andreducing pain in the neonate. In the 1990s, researchers beganto address this lack of knowledge by gaining a better under-standing of neonatal pain, developing tools that assess forneonatal pain, and determining appropriate and safe painmanagement for neonates.The 1995 National Association of Neonatal Nurses(NANN) position statement on pain management ininfants states that \"all health care professionals who carefor neonates/infants need ongoing education in theassessment and management of neonatal pain and thatneonates/infants be protected from the adverse effects ofpain\" (NANN, 1995). The 2001 Joint Commission on Accreditation ofHealthcare Organizations (JCAHO) pain managementstandards states that \"every patient has a right to have hisor her pain assessed and treated\" (JCAHO, 2:51 PM and Responses of the Neonate 397 TABLE 15-6 BALLARD MATURATIONAL ASSESSMENT NEUROMUSCULAR MATURITYPOSTUREAssess the position the neonate assumes while lying quietly on his back . The more mature, the greater degree of flexion in legs and arms. SQUARE WINDOWAssess the degree of the angle created when the examiner flexes the neonate's hand toward the forearm. The more mature, the greater the flexion. ARM RECOILWith the neonate in a supine position, the examiner fully flexes the forearm against the neonate's chest for 5 seconds. The examiner extends the arms and releases them. The more mature, the faster the arms return to the flexed position (recoil). POPLITEAL ANGLEWith the neonate in a supine position and pelvis flat, the examiner flexes the neonate's thigh to the abdomen. The leg is then extended. The angle at the knee is estimated. The lesser the angle, the greater the maturity. SCARF SIGNWith the neonate in a supine position, the examiner takes the neonate's hand and moves the arm across the chest toward the opposite shoulder. The examiner notes where the elbow is in relationship to the midline of the chest. The more preterm, the more the elbow crosses the midline.HEEL TO EARWith the neonate in a supine position, the examiner takes the neonate's foot and moves it toward the ear. The lesser the flexion (the further the heel is from the ear), the greater the maturity.PHYSICAL MATURITYSKINThe e xaminer inspects the neonat e's chest and abdominal skin areas for texture, transparency, thickness, and for peelingand/or cracking. A preterm neonate's skin is smooth, thin, and translucent (numerous veins visible). A full-term neonate's skin is thicker and more opaque with some degree of peeling. LANUGOThe examiner assesses the amount of lanugo on the neonate's back. Lanugo begins to form around the 24th week of gestation. It is abundant in preterm neonates and decreases in amount asthe neonate matures. PLANTAR CREASESThe examiner inspects the bottom of the feet for location of creases. The more creases over the greater proportion of the foot, the more mature the neonate. BREAST TISSUEThe examiner assesses the degree of nipple formation. The size of the breast bud is measured by gently grasping the tissuewith thumb and forefinger and measuring the distancebetween thumb and forefinger. The greater the degree of nipple formation and size of the breast bud, the greater the maturity. EAR FORMATIONThe examiner assesses the ear for form and firmness.The more defined the ear is and the firmer it is, the more mature the neonate. GENITALIAMale:The examiner palpates the scrotum for the presence of testis and inspects the scrotum for appearance. The greater the descent of the testis and the greater degree of rugae (creases), the greater the maturity.

Pain assessmenttools commonly look at state of arousal, cry, motor activity,respiratory pattern, and facial expressions. Some tools mayalso include blood pressure and oxygen saturation level. Pain assessment is part of the nursing care of neonates,and the tool used for assessment varies based on hospitalpolicies and procedures (Box 15-1) BEHAVIORAL CHARACTERISTICS The neonate is a biosocial being with very unique behavioralcharacteristics that affect parent-infant attachment (seeChapter 13). Temperament can vary from a neonate being an\"easy\" baby to a \"fussy\" baby. Most neonates vacillate betweenthe two extremes of temperament. The neonate experiencespredictable periods referred to as periods of reactivity. Periods of Reactivity During the first 6-8 hours of extrauterine life, the neonatetransitions between periods of activity and inactivity. This isoften referred to \"periods of reactivity.\" Each of the periodshas predictable neonatal behaviors. Initial Period of Reactivity Occurs in the first 15-30 minutes post-birth The neonate is alert and active. The neonate vigorously responds to external stimuli. Respirations are irregular and rapid (can be as high as 90 breaths per minute). The neonate may exhibit momentary grunting, flaring,and retractions. Brief periods of apnea may occur. The heart rate is rapid and can be as high as 180 beatsper minute. Brief period of cyanosis can occur. The amount of oral mucus increases. Period of Relative Inactivity Begins approximately 30 minutes after birth and lasts 2 hours Sleep stateThe neonate is unresponsive to external stimuli. The respiratory rate decreases and can fall slightly belownormal range. The heart rate decreases and is within normal limits. Oral mucus production decreases. Second Period of Reactivity Follows the period of relative inactivity and lasts 2-8 hours Varies between active alert and quiet alert state Periods of rapid respiration in response to stimuli andactivity Heart rate varies related to activity level and response tostimuli. Increased bowel activity and may pass meconium stool The neonate responds to external stimuli.The initial period of activity provides an opportunity for the parents and neonate to respond to each other. It is anideal time to initiate breastfeeding. The neonate is notresponsive during the period of inactivity and will not beinterested in feeding/sucking. During the second period ofreactivity, the neonate is interested in feeding/sucking, andthis is another ideal time for breastfeeding. Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale The Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Scale(BNBAS) is used to assess the neonate's neurobehavioral sys-tem. The BNBAS was originally developed as a research tooland has been adapted for use in the clinical setting. TheBNBAS is not routinely preformed on healthy neonates. It iscomposed of 28 behavior items and 18 reflex items. Thesebehaviors/reflex items are divided into six categories:Habituation: The development of decreased sensitivity to a repeated stimulus such as light, sound, or heel stick.It is a protective mechanism against overstimulation.Habituation may not be fully developed in prematureneonates or in neonates with CNS abnormalities orinjuries. Orientation: The ability of the neonate to focus on visual and/or auditory stimuli. The neonate will turn his or herhead in the direction of sound or will follow a visualstimulus. This response is diminished in prematureneonates. Motor maturity: The ability of the neonate to control and coordinate motor activity. Normal findings aresmooth, free movement with occasional tremors.Movement is jerky in premature neonates and/or inneonates with CNS abnormalities or injuries. Self-quieting ability: The ability of the neonate to quietand comfort self. It is accomplished by sucking on thefist/hand or attending to external stimuli. The ability isdiminished in neonates with neurological injuries or inneonates exposed to drugs in utero. Social behaviors: The ability of the neonate to respond to cuddling and holding. These behaviors are diminishedor absent in neonates with neurological injuries or inneonates exposed to drugs in utero. BOX 15-1 ASPMN POSITION STATEMENT: PAIN ASSESSMENT IN THE PATIENTUNABLE TO SELF-REPORT \"The American Society for Pain Management Nursing (ASPMN)positions that all persons with pain deserve prompt recognitionand treatment. Pain should be routinely assessed, reassessed,and documented to facilitate treatment and communicationamong health care clinicians. In patients who are unable to self-report pain, other strategies must be used to infer pain andevaluate interventions.\" Herr et al., 2011.3704_Ch15_375-416 03/10/13 5 Neonatal Period 400 Sleep/awake states: These are also referred to as infant states or behavior states. There are two sleep states andfour awake states.Deep sleep: During this state, there is no body movementexcept for an occasional startle reflex. The startle reflex isdelayed in response to external stimuli. External stimuli areless likely to cause a change in state. The eyes are closed andthere are no eye movements. Breathing is smooth and even. Light sleep: During this state, there is random bodymovement. Rapid eye movement (REM) is present. Theneonate responds to external stimuli with a startle reflexand with a possible change of state. Breathing is irregular. Drowsy: During this state, there is intermittent bodymovement. Eyes open and close, and have a dull andheavy-lidded appearance. Breathing is irregular. Responseto sensory stimuli is delayed. External stimuli will mostlikely cause a change in state. Breathing is irregular. Alert: During this state the neonate's eyes are wide openwith a bright look and focus on the sources of stimuli.There is a delay in response to stimuli and minimal bodymovement. Respirations are regular. Eyes open: During this state, there is a considerable bodymovement with periods of fussiness. The eyes are open. Theneonate responds to external stimuli with increased startlereflexes and motor activity. Breathing is irregular. Crying: During this state, there is high motor activity andintense crying. It is difficult to calm the neonate. The eyesare opened or tightly closed. Breathing is irregular(Brazelton & Nugent, 1995). NURSING CARE OF THE NEONATE Nursing care of the neonate during hospitalization is dividedinto two time frames. The first is the 4th stage of labor, whichis from birth through the first 4 hours of extrauterine life. Thesecond is from 4 hours of age to discharge. Nursing Actions During the 4th Stage of Labor The changes that occur in the neonate's body during thetransition to extrauterine life require frequent assessmentsand monitoring to identify early signs of physiological com-promise (see Critical Component: Danger Signs andCritical Component: Hypothermia). Early identification ofcomplications or difficulty with transition allows for earlierinitiation of nursing and medical actions to support theneonate in a healthy transition. The following nursingactions occur in the labor/delivery/recovery room and/ornursery depending on hospital policies and health state ofthe neonate. These actions are supported by the Associationof Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses(AWHONN) in its 2011 publication, Core curriculum formaternal-newborn nursing.Review prenatal and intrapartal records for factors thatplace the neonate at risk, such as prolonged rupture ofmembranes (risk of infection), meconium-stained fluid(risk of respiratory distress), and gestational diabetes (riskof hypoglycemia). Decrease risk of cold stress by:Drying the neonate immediately after birth to preventexcessive heat loss through evaporation. Discarding wet blankets and placing the neonate on dry,warm blankets or sheets. Placing a stocking cap on the neonate's head to decrease the risk of heat loss through convection. Placing the neonate in the mother's arms with skin-to-skin contact and a warm blanket over mother andbaby or placing the neonate under a preheated radiantwarmer. Support respirations by clearing the mouth and nose ofexcessive mucus with a bulb syringe when indicated. Use universal precautions and wear gloves until afterthe neonate has been bathed to decrease exposure toblood-borne pathogens from amniotic fluid and maternal blood. Obtain the Apgar score at 1 and 5 minutes and initiateappropriate actions based on the score (see Chapter 8). Assess vital signs.This is usually done within 30 minutes of birth, 1 hourafter birth, and then every hour for the remainder of therecovery period. The frequency of assessments may vary based on insti-tutional policies and the health of the neonate. Vit al signs are assessed every 5-15 minutes for neonates with signs of distr ess. Administer O2per institutional protocol, if the heart rate is below 100 beats per minute, cyanosis is present,and/or apnea occurs. Before administration of O 2the nurse should: Check the airway and apply suction if indicated. Stimulate the neonate by rubbing his back. Inspect the clamped cord for number of vessels and forbleeding. Complete and place identifying bands on the neonate andparents before the neonate is separated from parents (e.g.,taken to the nursery or NICU). Weigh and measure the neonate. Complete a neonatal assessment within 2 hours of birth.Explain to the parents the assessments and procedures performed on their newborn. Complete a gestational age assessment as per hospitalpolicies. Obtain blood glucose levels by using a glucose monitor.This is done on all neonates who exhibit symptoms ofhypoglycemia as well as neonates who are at risk forhypoglycemia. Administer erythromycin ophthalmic ointment to each eye.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendthat ophthalmic neonatorum prophylaxis be administeredto all newborns within of birth.3704_Ch15_375-416 03/10/13 2:51 PM Page 400CHAPTER 15 Physiological and Behavioral Responses of the Neonate 401 Refer to institutional policies for timing of the applicationof ointment. Administer phytonadione IM. Support breastfeeding by providing a relaxing environ-ment for the woman and her newborn (Fig. 15-9). Bathe the neonate with neutral pH soap. The initial bathis delayed until the neonate's temperature is stable andwithin normal limits. Promote parent-infant attachment by creating a relaxingenvironment:Cluster nursing activities to allow for periods of uninter-rupted time for new parents to spend time with their newborn. Dim lights and close room door. Notify the neonate's physician or nurse practitioner ofthe neonate's date and time of birth, and assessmentfindings. Ointment Action: growth by inhibiting folic acidsynthesis Common side effects: Edema and inflammation of eyelids Route and dose: Apply a 1/4-inch bead of ointment to lower eyelid of each eye. Precaution: Prevent the applicator tip from directly touch-ing the eye by holding the application tube 1/2inch from the eye. (Data Vallerand & Sanoski, 2013) Figure 15-9 Newborn breastfeeding during the fourth stage of labor. CRITICAL COMPONENT Promoting Parent-Infant Attachment The promotion of parent-infant attachment is a critical com-ponent of nursing care, and needs to occur as soon as possi-ble after birth. Often nurses allow other nursing actions totake priority over parent-infant attachment or find it is easierto do assessments under the warming unit. Assessments andmonitoring of vital signs can be performed in the parent'sarms when the neonate is full term, the Apgar score is 8 orhigher, and there were no signs of fetal distress during laboror at the time of birth. Nursing Actions Skin-to-skin contact with a warm blanket over the neonateand parent. Point out and explain expected neonatal characteristics suchas molding, milia, and lanugo. Provide alone time for the couple and their newborn byorganizing care that allows for uninterrupted time. Delay administration of eye ointment until parents have hadan opportunity to hold the baby. Once ointment is adminis-tered, the neonate is less likely to open his or her eyes andmake eye contact with parents.CRITICAL COMPONENT Danger Signs The following signs may be an indication of an abnormality orcomplication. Document these signs in the neonatal recordand report them to the physician or nurse practitioner: Tachypnea (>60 breaths per minute) Retractions of chest wall Grunting Nasal flaring Abdominal distention Failure to pass meconium stool within 48 hours of birth Failure to void within 24 hours of birth Convulsions Lethargy Jaundice within rst 24 hours of birth Abnormal temperature, either abnormally high or low Jitteriness Persistent hypoglycemia Persistent temperature instability Nursing Actions from 4 Hours of Age to Discharge The second stage of neonatal care focuses on monitoring theneonate's adaptation to extrauterine life and assisting parentsin learning about their newborn and how to care for her (seeCritical Component: Promoting Parent-Infant Attachment).The nursing actions listed are for neonates who do not exhibitsigns of distress or potential complications.Assess vital signs as per hospital policy.Vital signs for stable neonates are assessed at a minimumof once a shift. The neonate may continue to have difficulty in regulat-ing her body temper ature. Notify the physician or nurse practitioner if temperaturedecrease per sists. Complete neonatal assessment once per shift. The type ofassessment varies based on institutional policies.3704_Ch15_375-416 03/10/13 2:51 PM Page 401UNIT 5 Neonatal Period 402 Promote parent-infant attachment by providing uninter-rupted times with the infant. Promote sibling attachment by providing opportunities forinteractions with the newborn, such as having older siblingsassist with newborn care or listen to the newborn's heart. Prevent infant abduction from the hospital. Each hospitalhas policies and procedures addressing methods to pre-vent infant abduction. Common steps that are taken are:Footprints and photo of infant for identification purposes Arm bands on the mother, father, and neonate that con-tain the same identification number. The bands of theneonate should be checked with the bands of the parents atthe beginning of each shift and when taking or returningthe neonate from or to the mother's room. Personnel working in the maternal-newborn units shouldhave name tags that are specific to that unit. Name tagsshould have a photo and name of the person. Instruct parents and family members to not allow a person totake their newborn if the person does not possess the appro-priate identification that is specific to the maternity unit. Encourage parents to accompany any person who removestheir infant from the mother's room. Place the neonate's crib on the far side of the room awayfrom the door leading to the hallway. Instruct parents not to leave their newborn in the mother'sroom unattended. This includes when she is taking a shower. The maternal-newborn units should be secure and onlyvisitors with identification allowed to enter. Assist parents with infant feeding (see Chapter 16). Provide information to parents on newborn care (seeChapter 16). Teach parents about normal newborn characteristics (seeTable 15-4). Instruct parents to place their newborn on his back orside to decrease the risk of sudden infant death syndrome(see Chapter 16). CRITICAL COMPONENT Hypothermia Neonates with temperatures actions: with a warm blanket overboth the neonate and the parent. Wrap the neonate in warm blankets. If the temperature remains below 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F), place theneonate under a preheated warmer. Unwrap the neonate sothat the skin is exposed to the radiant heat. Attach the elec-tronic skin probe. The warmer is set at 1.5\u00b0C above theneonate's temperature. Continue to adjust the radiant tem-perature in relationship to the neonate's temperature. Monitor the blood glucose level as per institutional policies,as hypothermia can lead to hypoglycemia. Notify the physician or nurse practitioner if the neonate'stemperature does not return to normal ranges. Document the temperature and actions taken.SKIN CARE The skin of a term neonate is smooth, soft, slightly trans-parent, and has less pigmentation than that of an olderchild (Blackburn, 2012). The neonate's skin is subjected toa variety of stresses related to the birthing process and tran-sition to extrauterine life. Causes of potential threats toskin integrity are:Pressure exerted on the presenting part of the fetus duringthe labor and birthing process from maternal structuressuch as the pelvis, causing edema and hematomas Abrasions, bruising, and edema of the skin related touse of vacuum extractors, forceps, and internal fetalmonitoring Exposure to bacteria from the maternal genital tract Use of adhesivesUse stretchy wraps vs adhesives for securing probes andelectrodes Drying out and flacking of skin during the first fewweeks of lifeThis is a natural process in the skin's transition fromintrauterine to extrauterine life. Diaper dermatitisActions to decreases risk of diaper dermatitis: Change diapers with each feeding. Use superabsorbent diapers that contain gelling materi-als which k eep moistur e away from skin. Apply barrier products containing petrolatum and/orzinc oxide. Apply antifungal creams when fungal infection is present (Heimall et al., 2012) Because intact and healthy skin is a first-line defense against infection, the neonate's skin needs to be assessed ateach shift and with each diaper change, and care must be pro-vided to maintain healthy skin. LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTS Newborn Screening Newborn screening is a blood test that screens for infections,genetic diseases, and inherited and metabolic disorders and isperformed on all babies born in the United States (ACOG,2003) (Box 15-2).Routine newborn screening began in the 1960s when allbabies were screened for phenylketonuria (PKU), andover the years technologies advanced and can now screenfor approximately 30 disorders.Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism. Neonates with PKU are unable to metabolize phenylala-nine, which is an amino acid commonly found in manyfoods such as breast milk and formula. This leads to abuildup of phenylpyruvic and phenylacetic acids, which areabnormal metabolites of damage3704_Ch15_375-416 03/10/13 2:51 PM Page 402CHAPTER 15 Physiological and Behavioral Responses of the Neonate 403 and death, which can be prevented by early detection anddietary management. Each state has statutes or regulations on newbornscreening, and the degree of screening varies from state to state. Healthy People 2020 goal is to increase the number of states and the District of Columbia that verify throughlinkage with vital records that all newborns are screenedshortly after birth for conditions mandated by theirstate-sponsored screening program from 21 states to 45 states including District of Columbia (HealthyPeople, 2012). The National Newborn Screening and Genetics ResourceCenter provides a current status report as to which testsare required for each state. The list can be accessed athttp://genes-r-us.uthscsa.edu/nbsdisorders.pdf. Some states screen for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Obtaining blood sample:Provide parents with information regarding the screeningtest. Some states require the parents' written consent. The blood is obtained from a heel stick and may be collectedby nursing or laboratory personnel (see CriticalComponent: Heel Stick). The ideal time of collection is at 2-5 days of age, whichprovides time for the neonate to ingest breast milk or for-mula. Most are done within the first 24-48 hours becauseof discharges occurring during that time period. Neonatesare usually retested later at a routine newborn check-up. Newborn Hearing Screening The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communicationdisorders (NIDCD) reports that 2-3 out of every 1,000 infantsin the United States are born with a hearing impairment(NIDCD, 2006). The 2012 U.S. screening status report lists 34 states and Washington, DC, that have laws requiring hearing screening of all newborns (NNSGRC, 2012). Thehearing screening test is usually done in the hospital beforedischarge by a member of the nursing staff who has com-pleted special training and education in conducting the test(Fig. 15-10). There are two types of screening tests that may be used either alone or together. The screening tests relyCULTURAL AWARENESS: Cultural and EthicalVariations in Infants African American: Mongolian spots and other birthmarks are more prevalent than in other ethnic groups. Amish: Babies are seen as gifts from God. Have high birth rates, large families. Appalachian: Newborns wear bands around the abdomen to prevent umbilical hernias and asafetida bags around theneck to prevent contagious diseases. Arab American: Children are \"dearly loved.\"Chinese American: Male circumcision is a religious require- ment; children are highly valued; Mongolian spots occur inabout 80% of infants; bilirubin levels are higher in Chinesenewborns than in others, with the highest levels seen onpost-birth day 5 or 6. Cuban American: Childbirth is a celebration; the family takes care of both the mother and infant for the first 4 weeks;tend to bottle feed rather than breastfeed; if breastfeeding,weaning is early, around 3 months; if bottle feeding, wean-ing is late, around 4 years. Egyptian American: Children are very important.Filipino American: Eyes are almond shaped, low to flat nose bridge with mildly flared nostrils; Mongolian spotscommon. French Canadian: Five mutations account for American: High and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)deficiency. Iranian American: Believe hot/cold influences, with baby boys \"hotter\" than baby girls; infants may be confined tothe home for the first 40 days; ritual bath between the 10thand 40th post-birth day. Jewish American: Children are seen as valued treasures; high incidence of Tay-Sachs disease; male circumcision is a reli-gious ritual. Mexican American: Wear stomach belt (ombliguero) to prevent umbilicus from popping out when the infant cries. Navajo Native American: Infants are kept in cradle boards until they can walk; Mongolian spots are common. Vietnamese American: Mongolian spots are common. (Purnell, 2012)BOX 15-2 AWHONN POSITION STATEMENT: NEWBORN Health, Obstetric and NeonatalNursing (AWHONN) supports national minimum standardsfor newborn screening programs. Federal oversight is necessaryto guarantee that all newborns have equal access to timelyidentification and interventions for disorders that have beenidentified for routine screening. In addition, a combination offederal and state funding should be allocated to initiate andsustain programs that limit the effects of these disorders.\" \"AWHONN recommends that Newborn Screening programs include the following: Health care provider education Parent education Parental notification and consent, even if tests are mandatory Timely screening tests prior to hospital or birthing facilitydischarge Post discharge follow-up for additional screening tests orother services, when appropriate Resources for appropriate referrals Accurate and consistent systems for data collection Access to interventions and treatments indicated by thediagnosis.\" The Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and 03/10/13 2:51 PM Page 403UNIT 5 Neonatal Period 404 CRITICAL COMPONENT Heel Stick The heel stick is a common procedure performed on neonates. Blood is collected to assess blood glucose and hematocritand for newborn screening. Procedure 1.Provide parents with information on the test that has beenorder e d for their child. 2.Obtain required consents. 3.Warm the neonate's foot for 10 minutes by wrapping in awarm, moist washcloth. This will help f acilit ate circulation to the peripheral area. 4.Don gloves. 5.With the nondominant hand, hold the neonate's foot in adorsif lexed position. The nurse or technician should have a firm grasp of the foot, but the foot should not be squeezed. 6.Clean the heel with alcohol. 7.Puncture the skin in the lateral or medial aspect of the heelto decr ease the risk of ner ve damage. 8.Wipe off the first few drops of blood. 9.Allow large drops of blood to form and to fall on the testing material. 10.Clean the puncture area and place a small dressing over it. Document that blood was collect ed, type of t est, site of puncture, and response of the neonate. Figure 15-10 Neonatal hearing screening.BOX 15-3 JCIH POSITION STATEMENT: Joint Committee on Infant Hearing (JCIH) endorses earlydetection of and intervention for infants with hearing loss. Thegoal of early hearing detection and intervention (EHDI) is to maximize linguistic competence and literacy development forchildren who are deaf or hard of hearing. Without appropriateopportunities to learn language, these children will fall behindtheir hearing peers in communication, cognition, reading, andsocial-emotional development. Such delays may result in lowereducational and employment levels in adulthood. To maximizethe outcome for infants who are deaf or hard of hearing, thehearing of all infants should be screened at no later than 1 month of age. Those who do not pass screening should havea comprehensive audiological evaluation at no later than 3 months of age. Infants with confirmed hearing loss shouldreceive appropriate intervention at no later than 6 months ofage from health care and education professionals with expert-ise in hearing loss and deafness in infants and young children.Regardless of previous hearing-screening outcomes, all infantswith or without risk factors should receive ongoing surveillanceof communicative development beginning at 2 months of ageduring well-child visits in the medical home. EHDI systemsshould guarantee seamless transitions for infants and theirfamilies through this process.\" Joint Committee on Infant Hearing (JCIH), 2007. on physiological measures versus behavioral response.The screening tests do not provide information on thetype or degree of hearing impairment ( Box 15-3). These screening tests are:Otoacoustic emissions (OAE) is a painless test that is conducted when the neonate is asleep or lying still. Atiny, flexible ear probe is inserted into the neonate's ear. It records responses of the outer hairs cells of thecochlea to clicking sounds coming from the probe's microphone. A referral is made to a hearing specialistwhen there is no recorded response from the cochlear hair cells. Automated auditory brain stem response (AABR) is a painless test conducted when the neonate is asleep orlying still. Disposable electrodes are placed high on theneonate's forehead, on the mastoid, and on the nape ofthe neck. This screening test assesses electrical activity of the cochlea, auditory nerve, and brain stem inresponse to sound. A referral to a hearing specialist isrecommended for neonates who do not have a positiveresponse to the sound stimuli. Both tests need to be conducted in a quiet room. Vernix, blood, and amniotic fluid in the ear can interferewith accurate screening. Neonates who fail the initial screening test are rescreenedin one month. Diagnostic testing is recommended forneonates who fail the second screening (Delaney &Meyers, 2012).3704_Ch15_375-416 03/10/13 2:51 PM Page 404CHAPTER 15 Physiological and Behavioral Responses of the Neonate 405 THERAPEUTIC AND SURGICAL PROCEDURES Immunizations Hepatitis B is a disease that is spread through contact with blood of an infected person or by sexual contact with aninfected person, and it causes inflammation of the liver.The CDC recommends that all neonates be vaccinatedfor hepatitis B before hospital discharge (see CriticalComponent: Intramuscular Injections). CDC also recommends that neonates who have been orpossibly have been exposed to hepatitis B during birth begiven both hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immuneglobulin (HBIg) within 12 hours of birth. The second dose of hepatitis B vaccine is given at 1-2 months of age. The third dose is given at 6-18 months of age. Circumcision Male circumcision is an elective surgery to remove the foreskin of the penis. It is reported that 55% of newborn males born in theUnited States in 2009 were circumcised (O'Reilly, 2012). Thedecision to circumcise the neonate is made by the parents and isbased on their cultural, religious, and personal beliefs (Box 15-4).Contraindications for circumcision include:Preterm neonates Neonates with a genitourinary defect Neonates at risk for bleeding problems Neonates with compromising disorders such as respiratorydistress syndromeRisks related to circumcision:Hemorrhage Infection Adhesions Pain Benefits related to circumcision:Decreased incidence of urinary tract infections Decreased incidence of sexually transmitted infections The surgical procedure is performed by the physicianbefore discharge or at a well-child check-up. Three common circumcision devices used are Gomcoclamp, Mogen clamp, and Plastibell (Fig. 15-11)Mogen clamp is commonly used by Mohels when performingceremonial circumcisions. Procedure PreoperativeProvide parents with information on the benefits and risksof circumcisions, and the procedure. This is usually done bythe neonate's health care provider. Obtain written consent from the parents. Verify that the neonate has voided. A lack of voiding may be related to an anatomicalabnormality. Circumcisions ar e contraindicated when there is an anatomical abnormality. Ensure that the neonate does not eat 2-3 hours before theprocedure. This decreases the risk of vomiting and aspiration during the procedur e. Administer acetaminophen 1 hour before procedure per thephysician's order. Given for pain management ( Box 15-5 ). CRITICAL COMPONENT 13.Slowly inject medication or a vaccine to decrease the amountof discomfor t. 14.Withdraw the needle and rub the site to promote absorption. 15.Place a small dressing over the site. 16.Properly dispose of the needle and syringe 17.Document date, time, and location of injection.Intramuscular Injections Procedure 1.Review the written orders for the newborn. 2.Inform the parents of the reason for the medication or vaccine. 3.Obtain written consent when required. 4.Follow the five rights of medication administration. 5.Draw up medication or vaccine in a 1-mL syringe with a 25-gauge 5/8 needle. 6.Invite the parents to comfort their infant by stroking theinfant's head or hands. 7.Put on gloves. 8.Undo the diaper f or full exposure of the leg. 9.Identify the injection site. The preferred site is the vastus late ralis. 10.Clean the area with an alcohol swab and let the area dry. Itis ex tremely important to remove all maternal blood and amniotic fluid from the injection site to prevent transmissionof blood-borne pathogens. 11.Stabilize the knee with the heel of hand. Grasp the tissue ofthe injection sit e with your thumb and f orefinger. 12.Insert the needle at a 90-degree angle. 3704_Ch15_375-416 03/10/13 PM Page 405UNIT 5 Neonatal Period 406 BOX 15-4 STANDARD OF PRACTICE: CIRCUMCISION The American Academy of Pediatrics conducted an analysis ofmedical research on circumcisions. The following is a summaryof their findings and recommendations: \"Existing scientific evidence demonstrates potential med- ical benefits of newborn circumcision; however, these data arenot sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision.In the case of circumcision, in which there are potential ben-efits and risks, yet the procedure is not essential to the child'scurrent well-being, parents should determine what is in thebest interest of their child. To make an informed choice, par-ents of all male infants should be given accurate and unbiasedinformation and be provided the opportunity to discuss theirdecision. It is legitimate for parents to take into account cultural, religious, and ethnic traditions, in addition to themedical factors, when making this decision. Analgesia is safeand effective in reducing procedural pain associated with circumcision; therefore, if a decision for circumcision is made,procedural analgesia should be provided. If circumcision isperformed in the newborn period, it should be done oninfants who are stable and healthy.\" American Academy of Pediatrics (1999).A B C Figure 15-11 Removal of the prepuce during circumcision. A. Gomco clamp. B. Plastibell. C. Mogen clamp.Intra-operativeThe neonate is positioned and secured on a speciallydesigned plastic board, often referred to as a circumcisionboard. The board is padded to promote comfort. The upper part of the neonate is swaddled to promotecomf or t and reduce heat loss. An ear bulb is placed near the neonate to use if there isvomiting or increased mucus. The penis is cleansed and a sterile drape specially designedfor circumcision is placed over the trunk. A sucrose-dipped pacifier is offered during the block andprocedure for pain management. The physician administers a penile nerve block. The physician applies a Gomco clamp, Mogen clamp, orPlastibell (see Fig. 15-12). The physician surgically removes the foreskin with ascalpel. Petroleum-impregnated gauze is wrapped around the endof the penis. This promotes comfort by reducing the amount of irritation caused by friction with the diaper . PostoperativeThe penis should be assessed every 15 minutes for the firsthour for signs of bleeding, then every 2-3 hours accordingto hospital policies. The physician is notified when bleeding is present (larger than the size of a quar ter). Acetaminophen PO is administered every 4-6 hours. Voidings are assessed and documented. The neonate should void within 24 hours after theprocedur e.Parent EducationInstruct parents to watch for bleeding and signs of infec-tion, and to note when their child voids. Inform parents that the gauze will fall off on its own andthey should not pull it off. Pulling gauze off can interfere with the healing process. Instruct parents to fasten diapers loosely. Loosely fitting diapers promote comfort by decreasingpressur e on the surgical site. Instruct parents to notify the physician when: Bleeding is present (larger than the size of a quarter), Signs of infection are present, or The neonate has not voided within 24 hours.3704_Ch15_375-416 03/10/13 2:51 PM Page 406CHAPTER 15 Physiological and Behavioral of the Neonate 407 BOX 15-5 ASPMN POSITION STATEMENT: MALE INFANT CIRCUMCISION PAINMANAGEMENT \"The American Society for Pain Management Nursing(ASPMN) holds the position that nurses and other health-care professionals must provide optimal pain managementthroughout the circumcision process for male infants.Parents must be prepared for the procedure and educatedabout the infant's pain assessment.

INTRODUCTION Caring for a newborn and raising a child are major responsi-bilities couples take on with minimal formal educationalpreparation; yet, it is one of the most important roles a personassumes in his or her lifetime. Couples' knowledge pertainingto newborn care varies based on their past experiences withchildren, their cultural beliefs, information gained fromfriends and relatives, and what they have read or classes theyhave attended. Discharge planning and teaching begins during preg- nancy, when couples are encouraged to read about infantcare and attend infant care classes in preparation for theiremerging role of parent, and as they receive informationfrom their health care provider. Throughout the postpar-tum hospital stay, teaching is provided in short sessions tothe woman, her partner, and other significant people whowill be assisting the woman in the care of the newborn.Topics of instruction are reviewed on the day of dischargeto ensure that all teaching topics have been covered andparents feel ready to care for their newborn. Most hospitalsor birthing centers have standard discharge teaching formsthat are completed and signed by the woman and the dis-charge nurse. A written copy of key points of infant care isgiven to parents on discharge so that they can refer to theinformation provided. PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING Teaching plans need to be individualized and reflect theneeds of the parents. This is accomplished by incorporatingteaching-learning principles in the parents' education regard-ing the care of their newborn. The five rights of teachingshould be included in teaching plans for parents (Box 16-1). 417Don't have time to read this chapter? Want to reinforce your reading?

Infants breastfed at 1 year from 22.7% to 34.1%. Infants who are exclusively breastfed through 3 monthsfrom 33.6% to 46.2%.NEWBORN NUTRITION AND FEEDING Breastfeeding and bottle feeding are the two basic methods ofinfant feeding. Neonates who are unable to suck and/or swal-low are gavage fed (see Chapter 17). The choice betweenbreastfeeding and bottle feeding is influenced by past infantfeeding experiences, cultural beliefs, friends and family,health of the woman and baby, support of the partner, per-ceived health effects, and discussion during pregnancy with ahealth care provider. Breastfeeding Breastfeeding is the method of infant feeding recommended bythe Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and NeonatalNurses (AWHONN), the American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP),and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists(ACOG) (Box 16-2 and Fig. 16-1). See Critical Component: Primary Care Interventions to Promote Breastfeeding.BOX 16-1 THE FIVE RIGHTS OF TEACHING When you are making a teaching plan, you can use this as achecklist to ensure that you consider each of the five \"rights\" ofteaching in the plan.Right Time Is the learner ready, free from pain and anxiety, and motivated? Do you and the learner have a trusting relationship? Have you set aside sufficient time for the teaching session? Right Context Is the environment quiet, free of distractions, and private? Is the environment soothing or stimulating, depending onthe desired effect? Right Goal Is the learner actively involved in planning the learningobjectives? Are you and your client both committed to reaching mutuallyset goals of learning that achieve the desired behavioralchanges? Are family and friends included in planning so that they canhelp follow through on behavioral changes? Are the learning objectives realistic and valued by the client;do they reflect the client's lifestyle? Right Content Is the content appropriate for the client's needs? Is the information new or a reinforcement of informationthat has already been provided? Is the content presented at the learner's level? Does the content relate to the learner's life experiences or isit otherwise relevant to the learner? Right Method Do the teaching strategies fit the learning style of the client? Do the strategies fit the client's learning ability? Are the teaching strategies varied? Wilkinson & Van Leuven (2007), p. 530, Box 24-1.BOX 16-2 POSITION STATEMENTS ON BREASTFEEDING \"AWHONN supports breastfeeding as the optimal method ofinfant nutrition. AWHONN believes that women should beencouraged to breastfeed and receive instruction and supportfrom the entire health care team to successfully initiate and sus-tain breastfeeding. Discussions with the woman and her signif-icant others concerning breastfeeding should begin during thepreconception period and continue through the first year of lifeor longer\" (AWHONN, 2007). \"Breastfeeding is the ideal way of providing young infants with the nutrients they need for healthy growth and develop-ment. Virtually all mothers can breastfeed, provided they haveaccurate information, and the support of their family andhealth care system\" (WHO, 2008). \"The U.S. Surgeon General recommends that babies be fed with breast milk only - no formula - for the first 6 months oflife. It is better to breastfeed for 6 months and best to breast-feed for 12 months, or longer ...\" (DHHS, 2000). \"From its inception, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has been a staunch advocate of breastfeeding as the opti-mal form of nutrition for infants. Although economic, cultural,and political pressures often confound decisions about infantfeeding, the AAP firmly adheres to the position that breastfeed-ing ensures the best possible health as well as development andphysiological outcomes of the infant\" (AAP, 2008). Figure mother-infant attachment.3704_Ch16_417-438 16/09/13 10:19 AM Page 418CHAPTER 16 Discharge Planning and Teaching 419 Infants who are exclusively breastfed through 6 monthsfrom 14.1% to 25.5%. breastfeed is influenced by the woman's age, educational level, previous infant feeding method, careerobligations, support from her partner, and cultural beliefs.The woman's partner plays a significant role in the woman'schoice to breastfeed and to continue breastfeeding.The partner's knowledge and attitudes regarding breastfeed-ing are influenced by the partner's culture, past experiences,age, and family and friends. The woman's feelings and success at breastfeeding areenhanced when her partner supports breastfeeding, assistsin the care of the newborn, and does household tasks, whichfacilitate the woman's ability to rest and conserve energy.Advantages of Breastfeeding Decreased risk of infant diarrhea Decreased risk of respiratory infections Decreased risk of being hospitalized for respiratory syncytial virus Decreased risk of otitis media Decreased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis Decreased risk of childhood obesity Decreased cost (DHHS, 2010) Contraindications for Breastfeeding Women who are using illicit drugs Women with active and untreated tuberculosis Women who are receiving diagnostic or therapeuticradioactive isotopes Women who are receiving antimetabolites or chemother-apeutic agents Women who have herpes simplex lesions on a breast Women who are HIV positive (AAP, 2005a; DHHS,2010)In the developing world, the risks of artificial feedings outweigh the risks of acquiring HIV through breast milk;therefore, women are encouraged to breastfeed (AAP,2005a). Infants with galactosemia breastfed (D'Alessandro, BELIEFS Cultural Heritage Beliefs BreastfeedingArab Breastfeeding is delayed until the secondor third postpar tum day so that the mother can rest. Chinese May use formula until milk comes in. Filipino Women from rural areas are more likely to breastfeed for longer periods of timethan are women from urban areas.Start supplementing with other fluids as early as 2 months. Greek Believe that taking showers in the first few days of breastfeeding can cause diar- rhea and milk allergy in the infant. Hindu Some believe that colostrum is not suit- able for newborns and feed sugar wateror formula until milk comes in.Breastfeeding is often supplementedwith cow's milk that is diluted with sugar water. Japanese The grandmother will feed the infant formula if the mother is sleeping to pro-vide the rest needed for successful breastfeeding. Mexican May use a mixture of cornstarch and cow's milk when weaning from the breast. Navajo Soon after birth, the newborn is given a mixture with juniper bark to cleanse herinsides and remove the mucus.A ceremonial food of corn pollen and water is given. Vietnamese Some women will not feed newborn colostrum and will feed the newborn arice paste or boiled water until milkcomes in. (Purnell & Paulanka, 2008)CRITICAL COMPONENT Primary Care Interventions to Promote Breastfeeding Interventions to promote and support breastfeeding include: Formal breastfeeding education for mother and families Direct support of mothers during breastfeeding Training of primary care staff in breastfeeding and techniquesfor breastfeeding support Peer support U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2008 Composition of Human Milk Contains proteins, carbohydrates, and fats that are synthesized in alveolar glands of the breastProtein in human milk is easier to digest than protein inprepared formulas. Proteins account for approximately 6% of the calories in human milk. Lactose is the main carbohydrate. Carbohydrates accountfor approximately 42% of the calories in human milk. Cholesterol, which is essential for brain development, ishigher in human milk. Fats account for approximately52% of the calories in human milk. Contains vitamins and minerals that are transferred tothe human milk from the maternal plasma Contains antibodies from the maternal system, whichdecreases the risk for neonatal infections3704_Ch16_417-438 16/09/13 10:19 AM Page 419UNIT 5 Neonatal Period 420 Stages of Human Milk There are three stages of human milk as the body establishesthe lactation process.Stage 1: Colostrum is a yellowish breast fluid that is present for 2-3 days after birth. Colostrum is also excretedduring the later part of pregnancy.It has higher levels of protein and lower levels of fats, carbohydrates, and calories than mature human milk. It is high in immunoglobulins G and A. It acts as a laxative and assists in the passage of meconium. Stage 2: Transitional milk consists of colostrum and milk.This stage lasts from day 3 to day 10. Decreasing levels of protein and increasing levels of fats,carbohydrates, and calories Stage 3: Mature milk is composed of 20% solids and 80% water.It contains approximately 22-23 calories per ounce. Foremilk is the milk that is produced and stored between feedings and released at the beginning of the feeding session. It has a higher water content. Hind milk is the milk produced during the feeding sessionand released at the end of the session. It has a higher fatcontent. Overview of Milk Production Lactation is the production of breast milk. The woman's body prepares for lactation as the breastsdevelop during puberty and undergo further changes during pregnancy. Milk is produced in the alveolar glands and is transportedto the nipple through the lactiferous ducts (Fig. 16-2). Milk production is influenced by hormones and suckling. Prolactin, the primary hormone responsible for lactation, is produced during pregnancy, but high levels of estrogenand progesterone suppress lactation.Estrogen and progesterone levels decrease after childbirthand prolactin levels increase, which results in the stimula-tion of milk production.Suckling increases prolactin levels and volume of milkproduction.Milk production can be viewed as a supply-demandeffect. The more milk the infant takes in, the more milk is produced. Extreme malnutrition can lower the fatty acid content ofbreast milk. Let-down Reflex The let-down reflex or milk ejection reflex results in milk being ejected into and through the lactiferous duct system.Oxytocin causes the myoepithelial cells of the alveoli tocontract and force the milk into the duct system. Oxytocin is released in response to suckling and/ormaternal emotional response to hearing a baby cry orthinking of her baby (see Critical Component: InfantCrying). The let-down reflex can occur during sexual arousal oractivity due to the natural release of oxytocin in responseto an orgasm. The let-down reflex can be inhibited by stress, anxiety,pain, and fatigue. Let-down occurs multiple times during each feeding. Adipose midsagittal section.CRITICAL COMPONENT Infant Crying Crying is a late sign of hunger. Newborns whose cry is strong and continuous have difcultylatching onto the breast. Newborns who are crying need to be calmed by holding or byother comfort measures before being put to the breast. Process of Breastfeeding Breastfeeding is a natural process, with its successdependent on the woman's desire to breastfeed, properpositioning, latching-on, suckling, and transferring ofmilk (Mulder, 2006). Newborns indicate hunger by being in an awake/alertstate, making mouth and tongue movements, makinghand-to-mouth movements, and rooting (AWHONN,2006). The woman needs to be in a comfortable position. Pain and discomfort can prevent or delay the let-downreflex. A sitting position in a chair is recommended because itfacilitates good body posture. Other positions are lying on the side or back or sittingin bed. The newborn is held in a cradle position, \"football\" position, or cross-cradle position. Pillows are used to support the newborn and/or thewoman. The front of the newborn is completely facing the breast toprevent the newborn's head from being turned. Another3704_Ch16_417-438 16/09/13 10:19 AM Page 420CHAPTER 16 Discharge Planning and Teaching 421 way to describe this is that the newborn's ear, shoulder,and hip are aligned. The woman supports her breast by placing one handaround the breast several inches behind the areola.Supporting the breast takes the weight of the breast awayfrom the newborn's chin and makes latching on easier(AWHONN, 2006). The woman should avoid pushing down on the breast,which can tip the nipple upward and increase the risk forsore nipples. The newborn is brought to the breast, and not the breastto the newborn.The woman brings the newborn to her breast when the newborn's mouth is open wide. This assists withlatching on. To encourage the newborn to open wide, take advantageof the rooting r eflex by touching the newborn's chin to the breast. This signals the newborn to open the mouth.The newborn then reaches up and over the nipple toachieve an asymmetrical latch with more areola visible at the top of the mouth than on the bottom.Latching-on refers to the newborn's ability to grasp the breast and to effectively suckle. The newborn's mouth isaround the areola with the nipple in the back of the new-born's mouth. The lips create a firm seal around the areola(Fig. 16-3) B D CA Figure 16-3 Infant latch-on. A. Nipple is aligned with the baby's nose. B, C. As the baby latches to the nipple, the baby's mouth is placed 1-2 inches beyond the base of the nipple.D, To remove the baby from the breast, the woman inserts her finger into the corner of thebaby's mouth to break the seal. CRITICAL COMPONENT Signs of Successful Breastfeeding The woman feels a tugging sensation when the newbornbegins to suckle. Latch-on pain should last no longer than 10 seconds. Painbeyond this is a sign of poor latch. The newborn's tongue is between the lower gum and breast. Swallowing can be heard (AWHONN, 2006). The newborn rapidly suckles at the beginning of the feeding session. Suckling gradually decreases and thenewborn relaxes.3704_Ch16_417-438 16/09/13 10:19 AM 5 Neonatal Period Signs that the newborn's hunger has been satisfied arethat the newborn:Spontaneously releases suction from breast Does not respond with a rooting reflex when stimulated Is relaxed and calm (Mulder, 2006) The newborn should feed completely from one side andthen be offered the second breast. Many newborns andinfants nurse only from one breast at each feeding. It is recommended to start feeding from the breast thatthe newborn finished on during the previous feeding.This promotes complete emptying of each breast every6-8 hours and facilitates adequate milk supply in eachbreast. Newborns are burped at the end of the feeding session. Removing the Newborn from the Breast Proper removal of newborn from the breast is important indecreasing nipple irritation.Place a clean finger in the corner of the newborn's mouthand slide it into the mouth to break suction (Fig. 16-3 ) Once suction is broken, leave the finger in while remov-ing the newborn from the breast. Teaching Topics An increasing number of lactation consultants are employedby hospitals to assist women with breastfeeding. Lactationconsultants are valuable members of the maternity nursingstaff but do not replace the nurse's responsibility in provid-ing proper breastfeeding teaching and support. The nurseand lactation consultant work together to ensure a positivebreastfeeding experience. Before discharge, the womanshould be given information on lactation consultants andlactation groups she can contact if she has questions orproblems. A primary role of a nurse caring for a woman who is breast- feeding is to facilitate successful breastfeeding by providinginformation and assisting the woman in her breastfeedingtechniques. It is recommended that at least three completefeeding sessions per day during hospitalization be observed bythe nurse or lactation consultant to assess the woman's abilityto assist her infant with correctly latching-on to the breast(AWHONN, 2007).AWHONN Quick Care Guide to a sum-mary of AWHONN's evidence-based clinical guidelinesfor breastfeeding support that can be used to assist nursesin providing evidence-based nursing care. Maternal and newborn positionsLying down position: The woman lies in bed or on the sofain a comfortable position. Pillows are used to provideproper support of her head and neck. The newborn liesnext to the woman on his side so that his head is directlyfacing the nipple. A pillow or rolled blanket can be used tosupport the newborn in this position. Sitting position: The woman sits in a chair or bed withshoulders and back straight to reduce strain on her backand shoulder. The newborn can be held in several differentpositions. Three of these positions are: Cross-cradle position: The newborn's head is support-ed by hand, and the newborn's back isagainst the woman's f o rearm. The abdomen of the newborn is facing/touching the woman's abdomen.This is an ideal position to use when the woman isfirst learning to breastfeed and it facilitates good head control. Football hold position: The newborn's head is cradledin the woman's hand and the body is sup por ted between the woman's arm and her side. The newborn'shead is directly facing the nipple ( Fig. 16-4A ). Cradle position: The newborn's head is cradled in thecrook of the woman's arm. The woman sup ports the newborn's back with her arm and his buttock with herhand. The abdomen of the newborn is facing/touchingthe woman's abdomen ( Fig. 16-4B ). Determining effective feeding The woman feels physically and emotionally comfortablewhen feeding her newborn. The newborn properly latches on, as indicated by no nipplepain or trauma. A B Figure 16-4 Positions for breastfeeding. A. Football hold. B.Cradle hold.3704_Ch16_417-438 16/09/13 10:19 AM Page 422CHAPTER 16 Discharge Planning and Teaching 423 The newborn suckles and the woman can hear and/or seeswallowing, which indicates the transfer of milk. The newborn spontaneously releases his grip on the breastwhen satiated. Limiting time is not necessary and can be harmful inthe establishment of milk sup ply (Chantry, Howard, & McCoy, 2003). Newborn is drowsy and arms and legs are relaxed at theend of the feeding session. There are at least eight wet diapers and several stools perday once breast milk has come in and breastfeeding isestablished. The newborn recovers his birth weight by 2 weeks of age. A common tool used to assess and document breastfeedingefforts is LATCH (Table 16-1). The tool assesses both the woman and her infant andassists in determining the level of suppor t needed and the type of interventions required for the dyad. The lower the score, the higher the need for supportand education. The score can vary from one feeding to the next feeding. Decreasing the risk of nipple tissue breakdownNipple irritation can lead to tissue breakdown and mastitis. Painful nipples are a major reason that women stopbreastfeeding before the 8th week (Lewallen et al., 2006).Interventions to decrease irritation include: Teach proper technique for latching-on and releasingsuction. Problems with latching-on incr ease the risk for early cessation of breastfeeding (Lewallen et al., 2006). Apply warm compresses to the breasts/nipples beforefeeding to enhance the let-down r eflex (AWHONN, 2006). Instruct the woman to express colostrum or milk andrub it on the nip ple and ar eola at the end of the feeding session (AWHONN, 2007). Teach the woman to inspect her nipples for signs of irrita-tion: r e dness, bruising, and tissue breakdown. Early inter- ventions can decrease the risk of infection and bleeding. Change holding positions when feeding (e.g., footballto cr adle hold) to r educe pressure areas that have signs of irritation, as the pressure exerted on the nipples bythe newborn is not uniform. Begin the feeding session on the less sore breastbecause suckling is mor e vigor ous at the beginning of the feeding session. Instruct the woman to wash her breasts with wateronly. She should avoid use of soaps and alcohol, which cause e xcessive dryness of the breast/nipple. Instruct the woman to contact her health careprovider if she is e xperiencing cracked and/or bleeding nipples. The breasts then need to be assessed for signsof possible infection.

Lactating women need to consume an additional500 calories/day over the recommended pre-pregnantrequirements due to the increased energy requirement formilk production. They also need to drink a minimum of2 liters of fluid per day.Instruct women to develop a food plan based on \"MyPlate\" (www.ChooseMyPlate.gov) Instruct women to have a glass of fluid next to them anddrink it while they are nursing their infant since it is com-mon to become thirsty while nursing. Expressing and storing breast milkTeach women who breastfeed how to express milk andhow to store milk properly, as most will need to skip afeeding or feedings when they are away from their infantfor more than a few hours or when returning to work(Box 16-3). Milk can be expressed by hand or with theuse of an electric breast pump.For manual expression of milk, instruct the woman to: 1.Wash her hands before touching her breasts. 2.Massage each quadrant of her breast. 3.Place her thumb and forefinger so they form theletter \"C\" with the thumb at the 12 o'clock positionand the forefinger at the 6 o'clock position. 4.Push the thumb and finger toward the chest wall. 5.Lean over and direct the spray of milk into a cleancontainer. 6.Repeat this several times. 7.Occasionally massage the distal area of the breast. 8.Reposition the thumb and forefinger to the 3 and 9 o'clock positions and repeat the above sequence. Electric breast pumps A variety of electric and battery-operated breast pumpsare available. Electric pumps can be f itted with bilateral accessory kits so that both br easts can be pumped at the same time. Electric pumps closely simulat e the suckling of infants. Instruct women to follow the directions provided withthe electric pump of choice. Women can begin expressing and storing milk once theyare comfortable with breastfeeding and the milk supply isestablished. Women can express milk at the end of a feeding session andstore it for use when they are not present to breastfeed.Comfort and relaxationHigh levels of anxiety and discomfort interfere withsuccessful breastfeeding by preventing or delaying thelet-down reflex, which can cause a decrease in milktransfer and a decrease in milk supply (Mulder, 2006).Decreased milk supply is one reason women stopbreastfeeding by or before the 8th week (Lewallen et al., 2006).Assist in lowering the maternal anxiety level Provide the woman/couple with easily understoodbreastf eeding information over several teaching sessions so she is not overwhelmed by too muchinformation. Be calm and patient in interactions with thewoman/couple during br eastf eeding sessions. Explain that it can take time for both the woman andnewborn to become comf or table with breastfeeding. Ensure that the newborn is alert and ready to feedbefor e bringing him or her to the breast. Newborns will not feed well when they are asleep/not ready to feed. Praise the woman for her decision to breastfeed herinfant. Provide instructions on methods to reduce pain and to promote comfort: Explain the relationship of rest, relaxation, and comforton milk production. T each the proper use of analgesics that are recommended by the health car e pr ovider and are safe for lactating women. Demonstrate the use of pillows to support both themother's and newborn's body . T each breathing and relaxation techniques. Evidence-Based Practice: Breastfeeding PrivacySign Albert, J., and Heinrichs-Breen, J. (2011). An evaluation of a breastfeeding privacysign to prevent interruptions and promote successful breastfeeding. JOGGN, 40, 274-280. The aim of this quasi-experimental study was to determine ifusing a breastfeeding privacy sign during hospital breastfeed-ing sessions improves breastfeeding outcomes and maternalsatisfaction. The control group received routine hospital care and was asked to complete a feeding diary and questionnaire. The inter-vention group received routine hospital care, was asked tocomplete a feeding diary and questionnaire, and was given aprivacy sign and instructed to place it on the outside of theirroom door during feeding sessions. The intervention group reported fewer interruptions during feeding sessions than the control. A significantly larger numberof women in the intervention group than in the control groupreported that their breastfeeding sessions were successful. Implications for nursing practice: Decreasing the number of interruptions during feeding sessions by alerting nursing staff,hospital personnel, and visitors via a door sign can promotecomfort and relaxation during feeding sessions and increase thesuccess of breastfeeding during the hospital stay. BOX 16-3 AWHONN POSITION STATEMENT: BREASTFEEDING IN THE WORKPLACE \"Recognizing the that breastfeeding is the optimal form ofinfant nutrition, AWHONN supports legislation and initiativesthat promote and protect lactation in the workplace.AWHONN believes that employers should provide lactatingwomen with break time that permits adequate frequency andduration of milk expression within the workplace.\" Source: AWHONN, 2008.3704_Ch16_417-438 16/09/13 10:19 AM Page 424CHAPTER 16 Discharge Planning and Teaching 425 Women's hands and nails should be washed and all equip-ment properly cleaned before expressing and storing milk. Breast milk can be stored: At room temperature (77\u00baF) for up to 6-8 hours In the refrigerator for up to 5 days In the freezer that is attached to a refrigerator for 3-6 months In a deep freezer for 6-12 months (AABM, 2008;AWHONN, 2006) Glass, hard BPA-free plastic containers or plastic bagsdesigned for storage of breast milk can be used for milkbeing stored longer than 72 hours. The storage container needs to be labeled with the datethe milk was expr essed. An inch of space should be left between the top of the con-tainer and the milk to allow for the expansion of the milkthat occurs during the freezing process. Frozen milk should be stored in the back of the freezer andnot on the freezer door. Breast milk is thawed by: Placing the bottle or bag in the refrigerator overnight or Placing it under warm running water or Setting it in a container of warm water. Breast milk should not be heated in the microwave oven asit can cause uneven heating or overheating (AWHONN,2006). Overheating by either microwave or stovetop candestroy antibodies within the breast milk (AABM, 2008). MedicationsInstruct the woman to check with her primary careprovider and the infant's primary care provider before shetakes prescribed and nonprescribed medications, includingvitamins and herbal supplements (AWHONN, 2007). Bottle Feeding Breast milk is the recommended form of newborn/infantnutrition, but owing to maternal or newborn health or per-sonal reasons, not every woman breastfeeds (Fig. 16-5).Commercially prepared formulas are a nutritious alternativeto breast milk. Advantages of Formula Feeding The advantages for formula feeding are mainly for the parentsin that it:Provides a very pleasurable child caring experience for thepartner, as either parent can feed the newborn/infant. Provides the opportunity for the woman to leave thenewborn/infant with other people while she goes out orreturns to work without the need to pump her breast orplan activities around the newborn/infant's feedingschedule. Decreases the frequency of feedings because digestion offormula is slower than that of human milk. Disadvantages of Formula Feeding Need for increased time to prepare formula Increased cost compared to breastfeedingIncreased risk of infection due to lack of antibodies thatare naturally present in human milk Increased risk of childhood obesity and insulin-dependentdiabetes Composition of Manufactured Formulas Contains 50% more protein than human milk. Uses vegetable oils, which are easier to digest than animalfat but are devoid of cholesterolCholesterol is essential for brain development. Teaching Topics BottlesThere are a variety of bottles. Parents need to select onesthat are free of BPA and can be easily cleaned. NipplesThere are both rubber and silicone nipples. Silicone nipples retain fewer odors and last longer Rubber nipples are cheaper but tend to break downfast er and retain odors There are three types of flow rates: Slow - designed for newborn infants Medium - designed for infants under 6 months Fast - designed for older infants Flow rates are controlled by either the shape of the hole orthe size of the hole. Nipples need to be washed with soapy warm water andrinsed well. Figure 16-5 Bottle feeding is an alternate method of nourishing a newborn.3704_Ch16_417-438 16/09/13 10:19 AM Page 425UNIT 5 Neonatal Period 426 Feeding positions Newborns/infants should be held during feedings with thehead slightly higher than the trunk of the body. This position can decrease the risk of otitis media. Newborns/infants are usually fed in a cradle holdingposition. BurpingBurp the newborn/infant halfway through feeding and atend of feeding. Tap the newborn/infant on the back for a few minutes. Some newborns/infants may not need to burp with eachfeeding (AWHONN, 2006).Formula preparation (see Critical Component: are available in powder, concentrated, andready-to-use forms. Instruct parents to follow the directions provided by themanufacturer when mixing powder or diluting concentratedforms of formulas. Prolonged overdilution of formulas cancause water intoxication, and prolonged underdilution cancause dehydration. Inform parents that once bottles of formula have beenprepared, they need to be kept refrigerated and usedwithin 48 hours to decrease risk of bacterial contamina-tion (AAP, 2012). Inform parents that opened cans or bottles of ready-to-use formula need to be kept refrigerated and used within 48 hoursto decrease risk of bacterial contamination (AAP, 2012). Instruct parents to clean bottles, nipples, and can openersin a dishwasher or with hot soapy water. Instruct parents to discard unused formula that remains inthe bottle at the end of feeding to decrease risk of bacterialcontamination. CRITICAL COMPONENT Preparing Infant Formula Clean and disinfect the formula preparation area Wash hands Use bottles and nipples that have been washed in hot, soapywater and rinsed well or have been washed in a dishwasher Use boiled non-fluoride water or distilled water to mix withconcentrated or powdered formula The water should be cooled (room temperature) beforemixing it with the formula. Well water should not be used due to the risk of nitratepoisoning (AAP, 2012). Check the expiration date on the formula packaging. Wash, rinse, and dry the top of the formula can. Follow directions on the formula packaging for proper dilu-tion of concentrate or amount of powder formula per ounceof water. Mix the formula by gently shaking or swirling the bottle. Store mixed formula in airtight bottles in the refrigerator forup to 48 hours. Warm a refrigerated bottle by placing it in a container lledwith warm water. Store open containers of ready-to-use, concentrated formula, orprepared bottle in the refrigerator and dispose of after 24 hours. APP, 2012; WHO, 2007.CRITICAL COMPONENT Bottle Feeding Mix the formula as directed by the manufacturer. Hold the newborn/infant close to the body, similar to breast-feeding. Tilt the bottle so that the nipple is full of milk to decrease theamount of air swallowed by the newborn/infant. Do not prop bottles, as propping bottles places infants athigher risk for choking, otitis media, and tooth decay. Check the size of the nipple hole. The hole may be too big if the infant has a sudden mouth-ful of formula and almost chokes; or when you turn thebottle upside down and the milk flows out of the nippleinstead of dripping. The hole may be too small if the infant seems to be work-ing hard when sucking; or when the bottle is upside downand it takes longer than a second per drip of formula. Discard unused formula from the bottle at the end of thefeeding. Frequency and amount of feedingsNewborns take in 12-1 ounce (15-30 mL) per feedingduring the first few days of life. This increases to 2 12-3ounces (75-90 mL) per feeding by day 4 and graduallyincreases to 32 ounces (950 mL) per day. Newborns/infants can be fed on demand or at least every3-4 hours.Nutritional Needs During the first year of life, the infant experiences rapidgrowth. The infant will double his birth weight by 5 monthsand triple his weight by his first birthday. Caloric needs varybased on size of infant, rate of growth, activity, and meta-bolic rate.Infants experience growth spurts at 3-5 days, 1 week, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months and require more frequent feedings during these periods of time(AWHONN, 2006). Adequate nutritional intake is determined by plottingthe weight and length of the infant at each well-childcheckup. Birth-4 Months The nutritional requirements for infants are ideally metby breast milk. Iron-fortified infant formula is substitutedwhen the woman is not breastfeeding.Breastfeeding is on demand. Newborns usually feed 8-12 times per day during the first few weeks, gradually3704_Ch16_417-438 16/09/13 10:19 AM Page 426CHAPTER 16 Discharge Planning and Teaching 427 decreasing to 6-10 feedings per day. Women produce 500-600 mL of breast milk per day during the first fewweeks and 700-800 mL until semisolid foods are intro-duced. Milk production decreases once semisolid foods areintroduced. Formula feeding is either on demand or every 3-4 hours.Newborns start with 1/2-1 ounce (15-30 mL) per feeding and gradually increase to 32 ounces (960 mL) per day. 4-6 Months Feeding breast milk or formula is continued. Introduction of semisolid foods is determined by thephysician or nurse practitioner in collaboration with par-ents. American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and WorldHealth Organization (WHO) guidelines recommendwaiting to start solids until 6 months of age to reduceallergy risks. Parents should not introduce semisolid foods until recommended by the health care provider. Infants are ready for semisolid foods when they:Can sit independently Can draw in the lower lip as a spoon is removed Indicate hunger by opening the mouth Refuse food by closing the mouth and turning away Before 4-6 months, the sucking reflex forces semisolidfood out of the mouth versus to the back of the mouth. Pureed fruits and vegetables and single-grain cereal suchas rice and oats are the first food to be introduced. Cereal should not be given in bottles because there is anincreased risk of choking and aspiration when cereal isgiven by bottle. NEWBORN CARE It is the responsibility of the nursing staff in the postpartumunit to ensure that couples have an adequate knowledge ofnewborn care to safely care for their child. A teaching plan isdeveloped for all couples based on assessment of their knowl-edge level. Some couples require a minimal amount of teach-ing while others require intensive amounts of teaching. Thefollowing information on infant care is in alphabetical orderfor easier reference. Abusive Head Trauma Abusive head trauma (AHT), also referred to as shaken babysyndrome, is a traumatic brain injury that occurs when an infant is violently shaken (Christian et al., 2009).Approximately 20% of AHT cases are fatal (National Centeron Shaken Baby Syndrome, 2008).Infants are at higher risk for injury related to violentshaking due to:Weak neck muscles Large and heavy head When the infant is violently shaken, his or her brainbounces back and forth against the skull, causing bruis-ing, swelling, and bleeding within the brain tissue.Injuries caused by shaking can cause death or permanentand severe brain damage such as:Static encephalopathy Mental retardation Cerebral palsy Cortical blindness Seizure disorders Learning disabilities (Christian et al., 2009) Symptoms of injury related to AHT are extreme irri-tability, poor feeding, breathing problems, convulsions,vomiting, and pale or bluish skin (NINDS, 2007). Parents need to be educated regarding AHT and givenresources they can seek when their frustrations levels arehigh and they need assistance in caring for their infant.Inform parents that it is normal for infants to cry for 30-40 minutes Inform parents it is normal to feel frustrated when effortsto calm a baby are not effective. Inform parents it is okay to place the baby in its crib andleave the room. Inform parents to call family, friends, or Parental StressLine when they are feeling overwhelmed (Meskauskas et al., 2009). Bathing The first few bathing experiences can be stressful for theparents, but over time become a very pleasurable experi-ence for both the parents and their child. Daily bathing with soap is not necessary and can causeskin irritation (AWHONN, 2006). Cleansing of genitaland rectal areas at each diaper change and washing face and neck areas after feedings with plain water isadequate. Mild soap that has neutral pH and is preservative free isrecommended to decrease the risk of skin irritation. Use of soap on the face is not recommended. Bathing is done in a warm room that is free from drafts. Do not leave the newborn/infant unattended in bathwater. Gather all items required for bathing (e.g., soap, towels, washcloth, clean clothing, diapers, blankets)before the bath. Bathing is best done before a feeding to decrease the riskof emeses related to jostling during bathing. Use warm water for bathing (100.4\u00b0F /38\u00b0C)(AWHONN, 2006). Immerse the newborn/infant in warm water deep enoughto cover the shoulders (AWHONN, 2006). There is con-troversy regarding when an infant can be immersed inwater. Some believe that it needs to be delayed until thecord has fallen off and the cord site is healed, whereasothers do not. Follow the institution's policy on newbornbathing (Fig. 16-6). The newborn/infant's head and neck are supported by theparent's forearm. Start from the cleanest area (eyes) and end with the dirtiest area (buttock).3704_Ch16_417-438 16/09/13 10:19 AM Page 427UNIT 5 Neonatal Period 428 Cleanse eyes from the inner to outer aspects using a cleancorner of the washcloth per eye. This helps to reduce therisk of transfer of infection from one eye to the other. Wash hair and massage the scalp. Lift the chin to clean neck folds, where milk often collects. Cleanse the upper body. Cleanse the lower body. Clean female genitals by washing from front to back todecrease the risk of cystitis. Elevate the scrotum and cleanse the area. Dry the newborn/infant and put on a clean diaper andclothes. Bulb Syringe Instruct parents in the proper syringe forclearing mucus from the newborn/infant's mouth andnose.Each newborn should have his or her own bulb syringeand it should be cleaned with soapy water and rinsed aftereach use. Compress the syringe and insert it into either the nose orthe mouth. When using in the mouth, the syringe is placed in eachside of the mouth, the roof of the mouth, and the backof the mouth ( Fig. 16-7 ). When using in the nose, the syringe is placed in eachnostril. Release pressure from the syringe and allow it to slowlyexpand. Remove the syringe from the area. Remove drainage from the syringe and into a tissue bycompressing it. Circumcision Care Gomco or Mogen clamp:Apply a protective lubricant over the circumcision site after each diaper change for the first week. The protectivelubricant helps keep the area clean and keeps the woundfrom adhering to the diaper. The circumcised area heals within 2 weeks. Plastibell method:Applying lubricants on the penis when a Plastibell hasbeen used is not recommended because lubricants canincrease the risk of displacement of the plastic ring(AWHONN, 2006). The plastic ring falls off in 7-10 days. Parents should notpull it off. The glans penis (tip of the penis) appears red and forms yellow crusted areas as it heals. Parents should not washoff these areas. Instruct parents to notify the health care provider if thenewborn has not voided within 24 hours. Instruct parents to check for bleeding every 4 hours forthe first 24 hours and to notify the health care provider ifthere is bleeding at the circumcised area. Instruct the parents to notify the health care provider ifthe entire penis is red, warm, and swollen and/or there isdrainage from the surgical site (signs of infection). Clothing The amount of clothing varies based on whether thenewborn/infant is inside or outside and on the tempera-ture of the environment. Newborns/infants are usually comfortable wearing a dia-per, t-shirt, and loose-fitting outfit when inside. 100% cotton is the most comfortable clothing for infants. Infantsare at greater risk for skin irritation with synthetic clothing. Avoid overheating/overbundling infant at sleep todecrease risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).Signs of overheating are:Sweating Damp hair Heat rash Rapid breathing Restlessness Figure 16-6 Father bathing his newborn.Figure 16-7 16/09/13 10:19 AM Page 428CHAPTER 16 Discharge Planning and Teaching 429 More clothing or heavier blankets are used when thenewborn/infant is outside in cooler weather. A hat should be used when the newborn/infant is outsideduring colder weather. The newborn/infant's skin needs to be protected fromthe sun. Newborns/infants can become overheated with too manyclothes or blankets. Colic Colic is uncontrollable crying in healthy infants younger than the age of 5 months. The cause of colic is unknown.It is common for newborns to have a steady increase incrying until age 6 weeks, when it gradually decreases. Thistype of pattern is not necessarily colic. Healthy infants who cry for 3 hours for 3 or more days aweek and for at least 3 weeks are considered to be colicky. Symptoms:Infant flexes/curls legs when crying Infant has difficult/discomfort with bowel movements Infant is more irritable after a feeding Infant is more irritable when placed in crib Infant appears in pain Infant requires frequent cuddling Infant suddenly changes from happy to crying (Kvitvaer, B.,et al., 2011). Parents of colicky infants become frustrated as it becomesincreasingly difficult to calm/comfort their infant. Parentsshould give each other \"breaks\" so the partner can restand \"regroup.\" Methods for soothing colicky infants:Hold the infant and sway from side to side or walk aroundwith the infant. Give the infant a pacifier. Swaddle the infant. Place the infant (abdomen facing down) over the kneesand gently rub or pat the infant's back. Place the infant in a baby bouncer. Place the infant in a car seat and take him or her for a ridein the car. Place the infant in a car seat and put on top of a runningclothes dryer. Do not leave the infant unattended on thedryer. Place the infant in a stroller and go for a walk. Cord Care The umbilical cord begins to dry once the cord isclamped and cut. The cord clamp is removed after 24 hours of life. At thispoint, the cord is dry, hard, and black. The cord falls off and the site heals within 2 weeks. The diaper is placed below the cord to facilitate drying ofthe cord (Fig. 16-8). Instruct parents to contact the health care provider ifthere is bleeding from the cord site, foul-smellingdrainage, redness in the surrounding skin, or fever.Diapering Most parents use disposable diapers that come in varioussizes based on the weight of the infant; others use clothdiapers such as all-in-one diapers that contain a cottondiaper, nylon cover and Velcro or snap fasteners; otherparents use a combination of both\u2014cloth at home anddisposable when away from home. Change a diaper when it becomes wet or soiled to pre-vent skin irritation. Parents need to check diapers everyfew hours to see if they need changing. Gather supplies (e.g., clean diaper, clean clothing, andwet washcloth) before placing the infant on a flat surfacesuch as a changing table. Unfasten diaper and lower the front of the diaper. Lift the infant's bottom using an ankle hold and fold thesoiled diaper under the bottom. Use water to clean genital and rectal areas, wiping fromfront to back. Lift the bottom of the infant with use of an ankle hold,remove the soiled diaper, and then place a clean diaperunder the infant. Fasten both sides of the diaper so that there is a snug fit. Dress the newborn. Properly dispose of the diaper. Wash hands. Elimination Instruct parents on the stages of newborn stools (seeChapter 15). Explain that newborns pass several stools per day. At 1 month of age, breastfed infants may pass a stool onlyevery other day due to breast milk being more easilyFigure 16-8 When diapering, the cord is left exposed. 3704_Ch16_417-438 16/09/13 10:19 AM Page 429UNIT 5 Neonatal Period 430 digested, while bottle fed infants continue to pass one ortwo stools per day. Inform parents that newborns should have at least six wetdiapers per day once breastfeeding or bottle feeding hasbeen established. Inform parents that newborn diapers may have a pinkstain related to urates, which is a normal occurrence.Urates persisting in more than two diapers may suggestdehydration and weight loss. Parents need to report a continued presence of urates to the physician or nurse practitioner for further evaluation. Inform parents that blood may occur on the diaper ofnewborn girls related to a withdrawal of maternal hormones. This is referred to as pseudomenstruation. Instruct parents to notify the health care provider if stoolsare runny and green and/or if newborn/infant has lessthan six wet diapers per day. Instruct parents to notify the health care provider if thenewborn/infant becomes constipated. Constipation canbe a sign of inadequate intake and needs to be evaluatedby the health care provider. Feeding Review information provided earlier in this chapter. Follow-up Care Routine follow-up care of the newborn is an important com-ponent of health promotion. The well-child checkups providean opportunity to:Assess the infant's growth Assess feeding pattern Assess the developmental level Assess for jaundice Provide the appropriate immunizations Do follow-up metabolic screening Continue teaching parents about the care of their childand what to expect at each developmental milestone.Parents need to understand the importance of the check- ups and how they can promote wellness. The AmericanAcademy of Pediatrics recommends the following:First visit within 3-4 days after hospital discharge The second visit is 2 weeks later. Subsequent visits are at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months of age. Nonnutritive Sucking Sucking is a pleasurable experience for newborns and infants.There is both nutritive sucking (sucking during breastfeedingor bottle feeding) and nonnutritive sucking. Nonnutritivesucking, using a pacifier or the infant's fist and fingers, is usedto soothe or calm an infant.The parents' choice to use a pacifier is influenced by cultural, societal, and community norms.A pacifier should not be used with breastfed infants until1 month of age. This provides the time needed forinfants to establish breastfeeding.Pacifiers have been linked to shorter breastfeeding duration. The mouth motions a newborn uses when breastfeeding,referred to as suckling, are different from the mouth motions(sucking) used with bottle feeding or use of pacifier. A pacifier should not be used to delay feedings or substi-tute for parental attention. Do not tie the pacifier around the newborn/infant's neck. A cord around the neck places the infant at risk for strangulation. Wash pacifiers with warm soapy water. Potential Signs of Illness Parents should notify the infant's health care provider in thefollowing situations:Rectal temperature >100.4\u00b0F (38.0\u00b0C) or <96.8\u00b0F(36.0\u00b0C) Loss of appetite Lethargy (infant is sleepy and not as active as usual) Watery green stools Vomiting Decrease in the number of wet diapers Skin rash Fontanels are sunken or bulging Bleeding from circumcision site and/or cord site Foul odor from the circumcision site and/or cord site Prevention of Dental Decay Infants' teeth are susceptible to \"baby bottle tooth decay,\" acondition that occurs when sweetened liquids are given inbottles to infants and allowed to remain in the mouth for aperiod of time (see Critical Component: Decreasing the Riskof Baby Bottle Tooth Decay). Within 20 minutes, the sugarfrom the sweetened liquid responds to mouth bacteria andforms acids that cause dental decay (ADA, 2007). Infantswho fall sleep with a bottle in their mouth or who receive several bottles of sweetened liquids during the day are athigher risk for tooth decay. CRITICAL COMPONENT Decreasing the Risk of Baby Bottle Tooth Decay The American Dental Association (2007) recommends the following to decrease risk of baby bottle tooth decay: Do not put infants to bed with a bottle of milk, juice, orsugar water. Do not give infants bottles with sugar water or sodas. Clean the infant's gums with a clean gauze after each feeding. Brush teeth once the rst tooth erupts. Consult a dentist regarding fluoride treatments if the watersupply does not contain fluoride. Begin regular dental appointments by the rst birthday.3704_Ch16_417-438 16/09/13 10:19 AM Page 430CHAPTER 16 Discharge Planning and Teaching 431 Safety Parents are responsible for the safety of their children.Newborns and infants are at risk for injury related to falls,ingestion of harmful products, and accidents.Infant car seatsInfant car seats need to be used for all infants when trav-eling in a motor vehicle, including on the day of dischargefrom the hospital. Infants are safest when secured in the back seat. Rear-facing car seats are used with infants until they are 1 yearof age and weigh 20 pounds. Parents need to select a car seat that best fits their vehicleand follow the instructions on how to secure the seat to thevehicle's seat and how to properly position and secure theinfant into the car seat. Parents can contact a certified Child Passenger SafetyTechnician (CPS) for assistance in the installation and useof infant car seats before bringing the newborn home.Instruct parents to visit www.seatcheck.org to locate aCPS near their home. Each state has laws that govern the use of infant and children car seats. Laws for specific states can be viewed at www.seatcheck.org. Instruct parents to never leave their child in a car unattended. Prevention of fallsInstruct parents not to leave their newborn/infant on anelevated flat surface without supervision. Instruct parents not to leave their newborn/infant in aninfant car seat on an elevated surface unattended. Install gates at stairwells. Select a highchair with a wide base to prevent tippingover. Prevention of ingesting harmful substancesPlace all cleaning materials in upper cabinets out of theinfant's reach. Place all medications, including vitamins, in upper cabinets out of the infant's reach. Place safety latches on all lower cabinets and keep the cabinet doors closed. Remove lead paint from older cribs and infant furnitureand walls. Never leave infants unattended in rooms or yards. Prevention of accidentsKeep small objects out of the reach of infants to preventchoking. Remove strings and ribbons from bedding, sleepwear, andpacifiers to prevent strangulation. Keep plastic bags out of reach. Keep all sharp objects in drawers or cabinets out of theinfant's reach. Check water temperature used for bathing. Water temper-ature should be 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) (AWHONN, 2006). Set the water heater thermostat at 120\u00b0F or lower. Do not leave the infant in the bathtub unsupervised.Keep any guns unloaded and locked and out of the infant'sreach. Install safety devices around swimming pools. Do not cook while holding the infant. Supervise infants when pets are in the room. Ensure infant crib, highchair, and other furniture or playequipment meet current safety standards, i.e., all four sidesof cribs are fixed/unmovable. Cover electrical outlets. Sibling Rivalry There will be some degree of sibling rivalry when a new babyis introduced into the family. Older children will feel the shiftof attention from them to the new baby and may react to thischange in a negative manner. Toddlers may begin wettingthemselves or wanting to use diapers or crying to get atten-tion. Others may want to drink from a bottle. Some childrenmay hit or pinch their new sibling.Methods to decrease the degree of sibling rivalry:Start preparing older children during pregnancy for thenew family addition by talking to them about becomingan older brother or sister; having them feel the baby kick; and having them around newborn infants (seeChapter 5). Have older siblings attend sibling classes that are offeredby some hospitals and agencies. Bring older children to the postpartum unit to meet theirnew sibling. Give the older children a gift and tell them it is from theirnew brother or sister. Spend quality time with older children such as reading orplaying games. Take older children on special outings without the newsibling. Teach the older sibling about why babies cry and whyMom or Dad needs to attend to the baby's cry. Skin Care The newborn's skin is delicate and can be irritated easily. Theskin should be inspected daily for signs of tissue irritation andbreakdown (Appendix B).General skin care Avoid daily bathing with soap. Use cleansers that have neutral pH. Avoid use of adhesives because they can remove the epider-mis layer of the skin and lead to a breakdown of the skinbarrier. Apply petroleum-based ointments sparingly to dry skinand avoid the head and face. Avoid use of skin ointments with perfume, dyes, andpreservatives (AWHONN, 2001). Diaper dermatitis is common. Methods to reduce risk of and treat diaper dermatitis: Changing diapers frequently (8 times a day)3704_Ch16_417-438 16/09/13 10:19 AM Page 431UNIT 5 Neonatal Period 432 Rinsing or wiping infant's bottom during each diaperchange Using petroleum-based or zinc oxide ointments duringdiaper changes (at the f i rst sign of a rash) Avoiding use of powders. Powders increase the risk ofbacterial and candidal gr owth Avoiding use of antibiotic ointments, which canincrease the risk of aller gic skin reactions Exposing the infant's bottom to the air (done when theinfant is sleeping) Adding a 1/2cup of vinegar to the rinse cycle of cloth diapers to help remove soap residues and alkaline irritants. Diaper rash may occur when there is a change in theinfant's diet, when the infant is teething, or when theinfant is taking medications since these may change thechemistry of the urine or stools. Soothing Babies Newborns and infants cry when they are hungry, uncomfort-able, bored, exposed to new experiences, or sick. Parents needto determine the cause of crying. There are various methodsto soothe the newborn/infant:Feed if crying is related to hunger. Reposition the newborn/infant to a more comfortableposition when it is sleep time. Swaddle the newborn/infant. Hold the newborn/infant close to the body so she canfeel the warmth of the parent's body and hear the parent'sheartbeat. Hold the newborn/infant and rock back and forth orwalk around the house or dance with the infant in theparent's arms. Place the newborn/infant in a stroller and go for a walk. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden death of an infant younger than the age of 1 year(AWHONN, 2006). See Critical Component: Reducingthe Risk of SIDS.SIDS is this third leading cause of infant death, with1,890 infant deaths reported in 2010 (Murphy et al.,2012). There has been a 50% reduction of deaths related toSIDS since parents have been instructed to place theirinfants on their backs when sleeping (AWHONN,2006). Objectives of Healthy People 2020:A reduction of infant deaths from SIDS by 10% from 0.55 infant deaths per 1,000 in 2006 to 0.50 infantdeaths per 1,000 by 2020 An increase in the proportion of infants who are put tosleep on their backs from 69% in 2007 to 75.9% by 2020 (DHHS, 2012)Swaddling Swaddling is wrapping the newborn's blanket snugly aroundhim. This provides warmth and a sense of security for thenewborn, which can have a calming effect. 1.Place the blanket on a flat surface. 2.Fold the top corner over (Fig. 16-10). 3.Place the newborn on the blanket with the neck at thefold line of the blanket. 4.Fold one corner across the newborn's body and tuckunder his back (Fig. 16-11). 5.Bring the bottom corner up and fold under the neck(Fig. 16-12). 6.Pull the remaining corner across the newborn's body andtuck under the back (Fig. 16-13). Temperature Taking Instruct parents to take the infant's temperature beforecalling the health care provider if they feel that their childis sick. Digital thermometers are recommended over mercury-filledthermometers.CRITICAL COMPONENT Reducing the Risk of SIDS To reduce the risk of SIDS, the American Academy of Pediatricsrecommends: Placing newborns and infants on their backs when sleeping( Fig. 16-9 ) Placing newborns or infants on a rm mattress for sleeping Keeping pillows or stuffed animals out of the sleeping area Breastfeeding Maintaining a smoke-free environment Preventing overheating of the infant by controlling roomtemperature and using lightweight clothing (AAP, 2005b) Figure 16-9 Place the baby on his back to sleep.3704_Ch16_417-438 16/09/13 10:19 AM Page 432CHAPTER 16 Discharge Planning and Teaching 433 The American Academy of Pediatrics (2012) recommendsthe following:Rectal temperatures for children 3 years of age and younger Oral temperatures for children 4 years of age and older Axillary temperature (although not as accurate) can also beused for children older than 3 months. Instruct parents to take an axillary temperature by placingthermometer in the axillary region and holding the child'sarm against his side until the thermometer beeps(approximately 1 minute) (Fig. 16-14).Teach parents how to take a rectal temperature: 1.Clean the end of the thermometer with alcohol orsoapy water and rinse in cold water. 2.Lubricate the end of the thermometer with a lubricantsuch as petroleum jelly. 3.Place the child on his or her back and hold the legs ina flexed position. 4.Insert the thermometer no further than 0.5 inches intothe rectum. Figure 16-10 Top fold. Figure 16-11 Left corner Right corner fold. Figure fold.3704_Ch16_417-438 AM Page 433UNIT 5 Neonatal Period 434 5.Hold the thermometer in place until it beeps. 6.Remove the thermometer after it has beeped andcheck the digital reading. Teach parents how to read a thermometer.An elevated temperature might be related to overheatingfrom too many blankets or clothing. Instruct parents todecrease the amount of clothing and retake the temperatureafter 15-20 minutes. Notify the health care provider if the temperature remainselevated (greater than 99.3\u00b0F [37.4\u00b0C]). Uncircumcised Male Do not force the foreskin over the penis.The foreskin fully retracts on its own around 3 years of age. Forcing the foreskin over the penis or using cotton swabs toclean under the foreskin can damage the inner layer of theforeskin, which can lead to adhesion formation. Gently cleanse the penis when bathing the infant andwhen changing the diaper. Once the foreskin naturally retracts (around age 3), gently clean between the foreskin and glans of the penis when bathing the child.

Although this is asignificant decrease, the infant mortality rate, which indicatesthat 23,907 infants died in 2011, is too high for a nation withthe amount of available wealth and resources that the UnitedStates possesses. One of the primary causes of illness anddeath in the neonate is complications related to prematurity. This chapter provides an overview of the critical components of care of the high-risk neonate, which is a subspecialty of mater-nity nursing. Nurses who elect to work in a neonatal intensivecare nursery will need to gain an in-depth knowledge of high-risk neonates through additional readings and classes that focuson the unique needs of high-risk neonates and their parents. PRETERM NEONATES Period of gestation and birth weight are the two most impor-tant predictors of an infant's health and survival. Prematurityand low birth weight are the second leading causes of infantdeath in the United States, the first being congenital malfor-mations and chromosomal premature: 32 weeks' gestation (Fig. 17-1) Premature: Neonates born between 32 and 34 weeks' gestation Late premature: Neonates born between 34 and 37 weeks' gestationThe number of premature births has risen from 10.6% of live births in 1990 to 11.72% in 2011 (Hamilton et al., 2012).The greatest increase is in late premature births (Table 17-1).The percentage of premature births based on the race ofthe mother are:Non-Hispanic black: 16.75% 10.49% 10.4% (Hamilton et al., 2012) Prematurity is a primary reason for low birth weight.Classification of birth weight (regardless of gestationalage) is as follows:Low birth weight: Less than 2500 grams at birth Very low birth weight: Less than 1500 grams at birth Extremely low birth weight: Less than 1000 grams at birth Multiple factors place a woman at risk for preterm labor and birth. Many are modifiable, and many are not(Table 17-2). Common complications related to prematu- rity are (NEC). Assessment Findings Gestational age by Ballard score is at or below 37 weeks. Physical characteristics vary based on gestational age(Fig. 17-2) Tone and flexion increase with greater gestational age.Early in gestation, resting tone and posture are hypotonicand extended. The skin is translucent, transparent, and red. Subcutaneous fat is decreased. Lanugo is present between 20 and 28 weeks' gestation. At28 weeks' gestation, lanugo begins to disappear on the faceand the front of the trunk. Creases on the anterior part of the foot are not presentuntil 28-30 weeks. As gestation increases, plantar creasesincrease and spread toward the heel of the foot. Eyelids are fused in very preterm neonates. Eyelids openbetween 26 and 30 weeks' gestation. Overriding sutures are common among premature, lowbirth weight neonates. The pinna of the ear is thin, soft, flat, and folded. The testes are normally not descended, and are found inthe inguinal canal. Tremors and jittery movement may be noted. Figure 17-1 A very premature neonate born at 27 weeks' gestation.TABLE 17-1 PERCENTAGE OF PRETERM 1990 1.9 1.92 PRETERM 1.4 1.51 LATE PRETERM 7.3 8.28 Martin, & Ventura (2012).3704_Ch17_439-486 16/09/13 10:20 AM Page 440CHAPTER 17 High-Risk Neonatal Nursing Care 441 The cry is weak. Reflexes may be diminished or absent. Immature suck, swallow, and breathing patterns areobserved in very premature infants. These neonates maynot be able to take adequate oral feedings.Apnea, cessation of breathing for at least 10-15 seconds, and bradycardia, heart rate less than 100 beats per minute, are commonly observed (Goodwin, 2010). Hypotension may occur among extremely low birthweight infants. Heart murmur may be present related to patent ductusarteriosus. Anemia is common, especially among very low birthweight babies (Sallmon & Sola-Visner, 2012). Medical Management Lung maturity is determined with lecithin/sphingomyelin(L/S) ratio or phosphatidylglycerol (PG) before electiveinduction or cesarean birth, and for women in pretermlabor. Corticosteroids, betamethasone or dexamethasone, areadministered to the pregnant woman if the woman pre - sents in preterm labor, or if preterm birth is anticipated.Evidence suggests that corticosteroid administrationresults in reduced respiratory distress syndrome, NEC,cerebroventricular hemorrhage, need for respiratory sup-port, systemic infections, andneonatal 17-2 RISK placentaParity (0 or >4)Premature rupture of membranesBleeding in first trimester March of Dimes (2012).TREATABLE/MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORSAge at pregnancy <17 or >34 levelPover ty, unsafe environment of implanted embryos in assisted reproductionLow pre-pregnancy weightObesityHealth problems that can be cervixGenitourinary infectionInfectionPeriodontal 10:20 441UNIT 5 442 pulse oximetry Cardiac monitoring, oxygen saturation, blood gases, andend CO 2 Respiratory supportNasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) orintubation Laboratory testsBilirubin levels for neonates who are jaundiced Blood cultures for neonates with signs of infection Complete blood count with differential Electrolytes Blood glucose Calcium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, phosphorus, magnesium, albumin, liver function tests, and parenteralnutrition (Ditzenberger, 2010).

Antibiotic therapy as indicated to decrease risk of infectionor treatment of infection Opioids to treat pain associated with procedures that causemoderate to severe pain, such as with surgical procedures Blood transfusion if the neonate is anemic, or to replaceblood loss due to laboratory tests, or blood loss duringbirth (Charsha, 2010) Intravenous fluids as indicated Parenteral (intravenous) nutrition if indicated by theneonate's gestational age and/or clinical condition Central line if long-term parenteral nutrition is required Umbilical artery and umbilical vein catheters Information about the neonate's condition, treatmentplan, and follow-up care is provided to the parents. Nursing Actions Review prenatal, intrapartal, and neonatal histories for anyknown risk factors that would potentially impact the neonate. Participate in resuscitation of the neonate as indicated.The NICU nurse, neonatologist, and/or neonatal nursepractitioner should be present at high-risk births. Transfer the neonate to the neonatal intensive care unitin order to stabilize and provide ongoing specialized care. Perform gestational assessment to determine age and sizeof neonate.Protocols of care differ with gestational age. Perform a physical assessment, evaluating for problemsassociated with prematurity.Nursing care includes the immediate recognition and prioritizing of problems in order to decrease neonatalmorbidity and mortality.Assess for signs of respiratory distress:Grunting Flaring Retracting Cyanosis Provide respiratory support.Maintain a patent airway. Administer oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation withinordered parameters. Short-term oxygen administration may be given usinga mask. Long-t erm oxygen administration may be given using nasal cannula, oxygen hood, NCP A P, or ventilator. Oxygen is humidified and warmed to prevent drying ofmucous membr anes and dr opping of body temperature. A decrease in body temperature increases the bodymetabolism and increases calorie consumption. Suction airway as needed for removal of secretions asneonates have a smaller airway diameter, which increasesthe risk of obstruction. Maintain neutral thermal environment by:Drying the infant gently immediately after birth to prevent heat loss from evaporation Keeping the head covered to prevent heat loss due to radiation and convection Using plastic barriers made of polyethylene to coverpreterm neonates after birth to prevent heat loss andtransepidermal water loss Using a chemical warming mattress during resuscitationand transport to the neonatal intensive care unit Extremely low birth weight (ELBW) neonates are at highrisk for cold str ess during the period immediately after birth. Neonates placed in plastic barriers and/or onchemical mattresses immediately after birth have higheradmission temperatures upon admission to the NICU(Lewis, Sanders & Brockopp, 2011). Prewarming radiant warmers, incubators, and linens Controlling environmental temperature with use of servocontrol. A temperature control probe should be placed onthe neonate's abdomen to assist in maintaining theneonate's temperature within the normal range (axillary97.4\u00b0-98.4\u00b0F [36.3\u00b0-36.9\u00b0C] for premature neonates) Placing the neonate in a double-walled incubator to pre-vent transepidermal water loss and heat loss Encouraging kangaroo care (skin-to-skin care) in stableneonates Weaning infants gradually from incubator to an open crib(Brand & Boyd, 2010) Assess cardiovascular system:Signs of Murmurs support.Monitor blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and blood gases. Obtain and monitor hemoglobin and hematocrit as per order. Administer blood transfusion as per order.3704_Ch17_439-486 16/09/13 10:20 AM Page 442CHAPTER 17 High-Risk Neonatal Nursing Care 443 Apply transcutaneous monitor or pulse oximeter tomonitor O 2levels. Monitor vital signs, oxygen saturation, arterial bloodgases, and end CO 2as per orders. Assess responses to interventions. These responses maybe changes in breathing, oxygen saturation, vital signs,and neonatal behavior. Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance.Monitor input and output by: Weighing diapers to determine output Assessing frequency, color, amount, and specific gravityof urine to det ermine hydr ation status Recording fluid intake and output: and oral gas-tric tubes, chest tubes, F oley cathet er, stomas Restrict fluid intake as per order. Fluid restriction is commonly ordered for neonates withbronchopulmonar y dysplasia (BPD) and patent ductus complications that can leadto pulmonary edema. Monitor electrolyte levels as per order. Hyperkalemia (elevated potassium levels), hypona-tremia (low sodium le vel), and hypernatremia (high sodium level) may occur among low birth weightinfants (Charsha, 2010). Administer intravenous fluids as per order. Monitor the site of intravenous access for signs of infec-tion, skin breakdown, and inf iltration. Add humidity to the neonate's environment to decreasewater loss that can occur through the neonate's immatureskin, known as transepidermal water loss (TEWL). Humidity added to the environment prevents heat loss,improves skin int egrity, decreases TEWL, and promotes electrolyte balance. (Charsha, 2010). Meet the neonate's nutrition requirements.Obtain and monitor blood glucose levels as per order. Administer parenteral nutrition (intravenous) if theneonate is unable to receive enteral (via gastrointestinaltract) feedings or is advancing slowly on feeding volumes. Extremely low birth weight neonates (<1,500 grams) orneonates less than 32 weeks' gest ation: May lack the ability to digest and absorb feedings May have an inability to suck, swallow, and breathe Will most likely require parenteral nutrition (Charsha,2010). The dextrose content is titrated based on the serum glucose level (Charsha, 2010). Administer trophic feedings (small volume enteral feedings) as per order. They are often given while neonates are receivingparenteral feedings to ease the transition to full feedings,and enhance gastrointestinal functioning (Charsha, 2010). Administer enteral feedings orally or by gastric tube (gavagefeedings) depending on the infant's gestational age and clin-ical condition. Most neonates who are older than 34 weeks'gestation usually receive oral feedings soon after birth. Human milk is preferred for enteral feeding. Human milk requires fortification because it does not pr ovide the calories, pr otein, fat, carbohydrate,potassium, calcium, sodium, and phosphorus thatthe premature infant needs (Ditzenberger, 2010). Formulas developed specifically for preterm infants areavailable. These f ormulas ar e modified to promote absorption and digestion for babies with immature gas-trointestinal functioning, and contain the extra calories,protein, minerals, and vitamins required by pretermbabies (Ditzenberger, 2010). Use proper technique for gavage feedings (see CriticalComponent: Procedure for Gavage Feeding).When feedings are initiated and before each feeding, assess forsigns of feeding tolerance as follows (Ditzenberger, 2010): Check for the presence of bowel sounds. Assess the abdomen for bowel loops and discoloration. Measure abdominal girth. Check for gastric residuals by aspirating stomach con-tents with the syringe. Not e the amount, color, and consistency of the contents. Assess for emesis. Check stools for occult blood as per order. Check stools for reducing substances as per order. Assess stools for consistency, amount, and frequency. Use nonnutritive sucking with a pacifier during gavagefeedings (Pinelli & Symington, 2010). Nonnutritivesucking eases the transition from gavage feeding to bottlefeeding, and results in decreased length of hospital stay forpreterm neonates (Pinelli & Symington, 2010). Monitor weight daily. Weight gain of 10 to 20 grams perkilogram per day indicates appropriate growth and caloricintake for a preterm neonate (Ditzenberger, 2010). Monitor length and head circumference weekly. Calculate and monitor intake of fluids, calories, and pro-tein daily (Ditzenberger, 2010). Preterm infants requirebetween 105 and 130 kcal/kg/day. Administer medications as per order. Provide skin care:The skin of the preterm neonate is predisposed to injuryrelated to it being thin and fragile. It is important tocarefully assess for skin breakdown and signs of infection(Fig. 17-3) (AWHONN & NANN, 2007). Refer to Figure 17-3, a skin assessment tool developedby Association of Wo men's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONNs). Use a neutral pH cleanser and sterile water when bathingand only bathe the soiled areas. Use adhesives sparingly Change diapers frequently Change positions frequently Apply emollients to dry areas Use water, air, or gel mattresses Obtain laboratory test as per orders. Assess for signs of jaundice. Assess for signs of NEC such as abnormal vital signs,abdominal distention (increase in abdominal circumfer-ence), abdominal discoloration, bowel 443UNIT 5 Neonatal Period Transition the neonate from tube feedings to oral feedings (see Critical Component: Oral FeedingReadiness).Transitioning to oral feedings occurs when the neonate: Has cardiorespiratory regulation Demonstrates a coordinated suck, swallow, andbreathe Demonstr ates hunger cues such as bringing hand to the mouth, sucking on f i ngers Maintains a quiet alert state Properly position the neonate for bottle feeding by holding the swaddled baby in a semi-upright or uprightposition. Observe the neonate for respiratory status, apnea, brady-cardia, oxygenation, and feeding tolerance. Pace feeding and allow for breathing breaks since pretermneonates may become fatigued during feedings. Support breastfeeding.Evidence suggests that breast milk decreases the incidenceof NEC (Caplin, 2011). During the period of time that the neonate is unable tobreastfeed, instruct the mother in the use of a breast pumpand storage of breast milk. Encourage the mother to bring breast milk to the NICU so that it can be used for enteral feedings for her infant. Teach the mother about feeding cues, breastfeeding positions, correct latch, and evaluating the feeding. Weigh the neonate before and after breastfeeding to monitor intake. See Appendix A for additional nursing actions. Manage pain to prevent potential long-term sensory disturbances and altered pain responses that may last into adulthood.Assess the neonate for signs of pain frequently, and espe-cially during painful procedures. Instruments to measureneonatal pain among preterm neonates are available andshould be integrated into routine care. Administer sucrose and promote nonnutritive sucking during painful procedures. Administer opioids as per orders to treat pain associatedwith procedures that cause moderate to severe pain.CRITICAL COMPONENT Oral Feeding Readiness The decision to initial oral feedings should not be solely basedon the infant's post-conceptual age. Feeding initiation shouldbe based on nursing observation of individual feeding readinessbehaviors. Feeding skills develop at different rates, and infantsof the same gestational age may not reach full oral feedings inthe same time interval. Infants mature at their own pace andare influenced by the severity of their illness. (Jones, 2012)CRITICAL COMPONENT Procedure for Gavage Feeding Gavage feedings are appropriate for neonates who are <32 weeks' gestation or who cannot safely receive oral feedings. 1.Use a size 5-8 french feeding tube. 2.Measure the tube (used for orogastric route) from themouth to the ear , and fr om the ear to the lower end of the sternum. 3.Check for proper placement of the tube after each insertionand bef o re each feeding by: Placing syringe on end of tube and pulling to removestomach contents, and/or Injecting a small amount of air into the tube with asyringe while listening for a whooshing/gurgling soundwith a stethoscope placed on the neonate's abdomen. 4.Use tape to ensure that the tube is secured. 5.Check for residuals before starting the feeding by aspiratingstomach cont ents with the syringe. Not e the amount, color, and consistency of the contents. 6.Feedings may be given by gravity or pump over 15-30 minutes. 7.In some cases continuous tube feedings may be ordered. 8.To remove the tube after the feeding, pinch it closed andremove it swif tly. 9.Assess the neonate for feeding intolerance (Ditzenberger, 2010) Use nonpharmacological interventions such as swaddling,positioning, kangaroo care, and therapeutic touch, anddecrease environmental stimulus. Evaluate the effectiveness of nonpharmacological andpharmacological interventions.3704_Ch17_439-486 16/09/13 10:20 AM Page 444CHAPTER 17 High-Risk Neonatal Nursing Care 445 Provide developmentally appropriate care to decreasestress and enhance neurodevelopment by:Maintaining a quiet setting to decrease negative physio-logical responses such as apnea and fluctuations in heartrate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation Keeping lighting dim and changing lighting in NICU tosimulate night and day Clustering nursing activities to provide for extended periods of sleep Avoiding clustering painful interventions together Providing care when the neonate is awake Providing individualized care based on the neonate'sresponses and needs Allowing a break in care/stimulation if neonate becomesstressed Minimizing handling for neonates who are in an unstablecondition Positioning and swaddling Change the neonate's position slowly and gently. Reposition every 2-3 hours. Assess the infant's responseto re positioning. Position neonate in the side lying or prone position(enhances oxygenation and gastric emptying). The head of the bed may be elevated 15 degrees. Swaddle in flexion with arms and hands placed towardthe inf ant's midline. Cr eate a nest with blankets to enhance containment. Avoid swaddling or nesting that is overly r estrictive to neonat al movement (Carrier, 2010; Goodwin, 2010; Charsha, 2010). Encourage kangaroo care (skin-to-skin contact with the parents) for medically stable neonates. Benefits ofkangaroo care are:Decreases risk of low body temperature. Reduces illness, infection, and pain perception. Improves daily weight gain and mother-infant attachment. Decreases the length of hospital stay (Ludington-Hoe, 2011). Provide emotional support to parents and family members. Involve parents and family in all aspects of the infant'scare. This helps to decrease anxiety and fears, thus allow-ing for an increase in parent-infant bonding.Teach parents what to expect from their preterm infantand how to interpret behavioral cues. Teach parents how to provide care for their infant (Fig. 17-4).Encourage parent-infant bonding by welcoming parents tothe NICU and praising them for their involvement withtheir infant. Teach parents about the infant's condition and involveparents in the plan of care. Discharge teaching is essential for a safe transition fromthe NICU to home. Prepare the family for the neonate'sdischarge by:Teaching parents about infant feeding Teaching about use of any equipment, such as apneamonitors that may be needed to care for their infant at home Teaching parents how to perform treatments such as dress-ing changes, suctioning, and oxygen administration Teaching parents about medication administration Teaching parents about safety issues such as car seat use,and positioning the infant on his or her back during sleep Encouraging parents to learn infant CPR Teaching parents about basic newborn care Educating parents on what to expect after discharge, suchas sleep patterns, feeding, infant behavior, and develop-mental milestones Discussing follow-up care such as physician's visits, immu-nization schedules, and appointments for developmental care Respiratory Distress Syndrome Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a life-threateninglung disorder that results from underdeveloped and smallalveoli and insufficient levels of pulmonary surfactant. Thesetwo combined factors can cause an alteration in alveoli surfaceEvidence-Based Practice: Sucrose for Analgesia Hatfield, L., Chang, M., Deluca, J., & Polomano, R. (2011). TheAnalgesic Properties of Intraoral Sucrose. An Integrative Review. An integrative review of published randomized control trialswas conducted to determine the effective use of oral sucrose asa preprocedural intervention for mild to moderate proceduralpain in infants. Conclusion of the review indicates that oralsucrose is an effective, safe, and immediate-acting analgesic forreducing crying time and significantly decreases biobehavioralpain response following painful procedures.

Figure 17-3 Neonatal Skin Condition Score.3704_Ch17_439-486 16/09/13 10:20 AM Page 445UNIT 5 Neonatal Period 446 tension that eventually results in atelectasis. The effects ofatelectasis are:Hypoxemia and the compromised pulmonary perfusion Metabolic acidosis that occurs from a buildup of lacticacid that results from prolonged periods of hypoxemia Respiratory acidosis that occurs from the collapsed alveolibeing unable to rid the body of excess carbon dioxideThe incidence of RDS decreases with increasing gesta- tional age. It affects 10% of all premature infants, themajority of these born at less than 28 weeks' gestation(Askin, 2010). Pulmonary surfactant is a substance that is composed of 90% phospholipids and 10% proteins.It is produced by type II alveolar cells within the lungs. The alveolar cells begin to produce pulmonary surfactantaround 24-28 weeks and continue to term. It reduces the surface tension within the lungs andincreases the pulmonary compliance which prevents the alveoli from collapsing at the end of expiration.Surfactant replacement therapy is discussed later in this chapter.Tests used to evaluate fetal lung maturity are: Phosphatidylglycerol (PG):PG is synthesized from mature lung alveolar cells. It is present in the amniotic fluid within 2-6 weeks offull-term gestation. The presence of PG indicates lung maturity and a decreaseindicates risk of respiratory distress syndrome.Lecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio:Lecithin and sphingomyelin are two phospholipids that aredetected in the amniotic fluid. The ratio between the two phospholipids provides infor-mation on the level of surfactant. A L/S ratio greater than 2:1 in a nondiabetic womanindicates the fetus's lungs are mature. A L/S ratio of 3:1 in a diabetic woman indicates thefetus's lungs are mature. Complications of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) include:Patent ductus arteriosus Pneumothorax Bronchopulmonary hypertension Pulmonary edema Hypotension and altered calcium and sodium levels Retinopathy of prematurity Seizures Intraventricular hemorrhage Assessment Findings Respiratory distress varies based on degree of prematurity. Respiratory difficulty begins shortly after delivery and the neonate must work progressively harder at breathing to maintain open terminal airways (Askin, 2010). Tachypnea is present. Intercostal retractions; seesaw breathing patterns occur. Expiratory grunting. Nasal flaring is present. Increased oxygen requirements are increased to maintaina Pa O2and Pa CO2within normal limits. The normal range of Pa O2is 60-70 mm Hg. The normal range of Pa CO2is 35-45 mm Hg. Skin color is gray or dusky. Breath sounds on auscultation are decreased. Rales arepresent as RDS progresses. The neonate is lethargic and hypotonic. X-ray exam shows a reticulogranular pattern of theperipheral lung fields and air bronchograms (Ghodrat,2006). Hypoxemia may occur (Pa O2<50 mm Hg). Acidosis may result from sustained hypoxemia. Medical Management Continuous pulse oximetry Cardiac monitoring, oxygen saturation, arterial bloodgases, and end CO 2 Endotracheal tube when clinically indicated Exogenous surfactant as indicated for neonates at risk forRDS or with RDS (see Critical Component: SurfactantReplacement Therapy Administration) Figure 17-4 Parents bottle feeding their baby.3704_Ch17_439-486 16/09/13 10:20 AM Page 446CHAPTER 17 High-Risk Neonatal Nursing Care 447 Respiratory support as indicated. The mode of ventilationand settings are based on the neonate's condition andarterial blood gas results. Methods of respiratory supportinclude:Oxygen therapy by mask, hood, or cannula for neonatesrequiring short-term oxygen support Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) used forneonates who are at risk for RDS or with RDS. It can beadministered by mask, nasal prongs, endotracheal tube, ornasopharyngeal route. Mechanical ventilation used when CPAP is not effective(use judiciously to avoid damage to lung tissue) High-frequency oscillatory ventilation used when mechan-ical ventilation has proven unsuccessful Delivers small volumes of gas at a high rate (>300breaths/minute) Less tr aumatic on fragile lung tissue Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy(ECMO) is a cardiopulmonary bypass machine with a membrane oxygenator that is used when the neonatedoes not respond to conventional ventilator therapy.Blood shunts from the right atrium and is returned to the aorta, allowing time for the lungs to heal andmature. Diagnostic testsChest x-ray exam to assist in evaluation of RDS Laboratory testsArterial, venous, or capillary blood gases Blood cultures if infection is suspected MedicationsAntibiotics as indicatedNursing Actions Nursing actions for neonates with RDS are similar toactions for preterm neonates, with additional emphasis onthe following:Provide respiratory support.Maintain a patent airway. Assess for correct placement of endotracheal tube. Listen for equal breath sounds bilaterally, assess forequal chest rise, use commercial end tidal CO 2detector. Administer oxygen as ordered to maintain oxygen satura-tion within ordered parameters. Hypoxemia and acidosis may further decrease surfac-tant pr oduction. Short-term oxygen administration may be given using amask or tubing. Long-term oxygen administration may be given using anasal cannula or oxygen hood. Oxygen is humidified and warmed. Warmed oxygen aids in thermoregulation for the infant. Administer and monitor continuous positive airway pres-sure (CPAP), mechanical ventilation, high-frequencyoscillatory ventilation, and/or ECMO as per order. Minimize oxygen demand by maintaining a neutral ther-mal environment, clustering care to decrease stress, andtreating acidosis as clinically indicated and ordered. Suction airway as needed for removal of secretions asneonates have a smaller airway diameter, which increasesthe risk of obstruction. Suctioning may stimulate the vagus nerve, causingbradycardia, hypoxemia, or br onchospasm. CRITICAL COMPONENT Dosing Regimen (dose and technique vary by product) Prophylaxis: Initiated within 15 minutes of birth, based on riskfactors of RDS such as gestational age less than 27-30 weeks.Multiple doses can be given if indicated. Rescue therapy: Treatment of conrmed RDS. Treatment istypically initiated within 8 hours of birth for infants who haveincreased oxygen demands and need mechanical ventilation. Adverse Effects Bradycardia, decreased oxygen saturation, tachycardia, reflux,gagging, cyanosis, tube,hypotension Benefits of Surfactant Therapy Prophylactic therapy decreases the occurrence of RDS andmortality in preterm neonates. Decreased risk of pneumothorax Decreased risk of intraventricular hemorrhage Decreased risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia Decreased risk of pulmonary interstitial emphysemaSurfactant Replacement Therapy Administration Natural Surfactant Composed of calf, pig, or cow lung (minced) Examples: Survanta, Curosurf, Infasurf Synthetic tension of the alveoli, thus preventing col-lapse during expiration Enhances lung compliance, allowing easier inflation, whichdecreases the work of breathing Indications Respiratory distress, meconium aspiration syndrome, per-sistent pulmonary hypertension Route Administered via endotracheal tube (Askin, 2010; Young & Magnum, Page Neonatal vital signs, oxygen saturation, blood gases, andend CO 2as per orders. Maintain neutral thermal environment to decrease risk ofcold stress.Cold stress increases oxygen consumption, may promoteacidosis, and may further impair surfactant production. Monitor intake and output and daily weights.Dehydration impairs ability to clear airways becausemucus contribute to alveolar infiltrates orpulmonary edema. Weight loss and increased urine output may indicatediuretic phase of RDS. Promote rest by implementing calming measures oradministering ordered sedation.Minimizing stimulation and energy expenditure reducesmetabolic rate and oxygen consumption. Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung problem that affects neonates who have been treated withmechanical ventilation and oxygen for problems such as RDS (see Critical Component: BronchopulmonaryDysplasia). Neonates who are dependent on oxygen beyond28 days of life and/or have been on mechanical ventilationare at risk for BPD. BPD leads to decreased lung compliance and pulmonary function secondary to fibrosis,atelectasis, increased pulmonary resistance, and overdisten-tion of the lungs (Bancalari & Walsh, 2011; Askin, 2010)(Fig. 17-5). Pulmonary edema results from the increased pulmonary vascular resistance. The prognosis for infantswith BPD is dependent on the severity of the disease and the infant's overall health status. Long-term outcomesmay include prolonged hospitalization, long-term oxygentherapy that may be required after discharge, cerebral palsy, retinopathy of prematurity, and hearing loss. Themortality rate once discharged is less than 10% (Askin,2010).Risk factors for BPDPrematurity RDS Oxygen toxicity Intubation Assisted ventilation with positive pressure Lower gestational age and birth weight (<32 weeks) Infection Pulmonary vascular damage secondary to excessive shunting 449 patent ductus arteriosus, and increased airway resistance(Bancalari & Walsh, 2011). Complications of BPD:Pneumonia, upper respiratory infection Ear infections Congestive heart failure Developmental delays Cerebral palsy Hearing loss Retinopathy of prematurity Sudden death Assessment Findings Chest retractions Audible rales, and rhonchi Hypoxia Respiratory acidosis Bronchospasm Difficulty weaning from or for ventilator Intolerance to fluids: edema, decreased urinary output,and weight gain Chest x-ray exam results exhibit cardiomegaly, lunghyperinflation, and infiltrates (Askin, 2010). Medical Management Diagnostic testsChest x-ray exam to assess for cardiomegaly, lung hyperin-flation, and infiltrates Echocardiogram if cardiac complications are suspected Laboratory testsElectrolytes Arterial blood gases MedicationsBronchodilators: Administered to reduce bronchoconstriction Corticosteroids: Administered to reduce bronchospasm,edema, and inflammation of pulmonary tissue Diuretics: Administered to treat fluid retention anddecrease risk for pulmonary edema Prophylaxes against respiratory syncytial virus, as infantswith BPD are predisposed to this infection Chest physiotherapy Respiratory assistance and oxygen therapy Monitor intake and output Determine the amount of fluid intake Determine the method of feeding to meet the neonate'snutritional and caloric needsNursing Actions Nursing actions for neonates with BPD are similar to actions forpreterm neonates with additional emphasis on the following:Provide mechanical ventilation and oxygen administra-tion as per orders.Gradually wean neonate from mechanical ventilation asper orders. Provide chest physiotherapy as per order. Restrict fluid intake as per orders.Provide maximum calories with minimal fluid.Fortification of formula or breast milk may be needed toobtain optimal growth. Infants with BPD have a higher metabolic rate at rest(Bancalari & Walsh, 2011). Administer medications as per orders. Monitor intake and output.Infants with BPD are at risk for fluid overload edema. Patent Ductus open after birth (Fig. 17-6). Normally, theductus arteriosus closes shortly after birth, but prematuritymay lead to delayed closure. The incidence of PDA amongterm neonates is 1:2000 live births (Sadowski, 2010).Risk PDAPrematurity. The occurrence of PDA is greater amongneonates of lower gestational age and birth weight. 45% of neonates who weigh less than 1,750 grams 80% of neonates who weigh less than 1,200 grams atbirth (Sadow ski, 2010) ComplicationsCongestive heart failure in preterm neonates disease Renal failure NEC Intraventricular hemorrhage (Hammerman, Bin-Nun, &Kaplan, 2012) Assessment Findings Heart murmur at the upper left sternal border (someneonates with PDA may not have an audible murmur) Active precordium Widened pulse pressure with decreased diastolic bloodpressure Tachycardia and tachypnea Recurrent apnea Increased work of breathing Bounding pulses Difficulty weaning from ventilator support Increased demand for oxygen or ventilation The presence of a patent ductus arteriosus confirmed byechocardiogram Chest x-ray exam may show increased pulmonary vascu-lature, pulmonary edema, and mild enlargement Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia Treatment for is a regimen of support and time: time forthe normal repair process within the lungs to improve function-ing and time for the infant to grow and thrive.3704_Ch17_439-486 16/09/13 10:20 AM Page 449UNIT 5 Neonatal Period 450 Medical Management Diagnostic testsEchocardiogram to assist in evaluation of PDA MedicationsIndomethacin, a prostaglandin inhibitor, is administeredto facilitate the closure and reduces the risk for surgicalintervention. It is also administered to decrease the risk ofsevere intraventricular hemorrhage (Johnston, Gilliam-Krakauer, Fuller, & Reese, 2012). Diuretics Cardiology consultant to determine the method of treat-ment and need for surgical interventionMedical treatment may first be fluid restriction and diuretics. Surgical ligation (suture, clip, or coil) neonates with a hemodynamically significant PDAwho do not respond to medical management orindomethacin. Nursing Actions Nursing actions for neonates with PDA are similar toactions for preterm neonates with additional emphasis onthe following:Administer oxygen and mechanical ventilation as perorders. Restrict fluids as per orders. Administer medications as per orders. Monitor intake and output for signs of fluid overload. Prepare the neonate and family for surgery. Periventricular-Intraventricular Hemorrhage Periventricular/Intraventricular common forms theneonate. They occur among premature neonates, neonateswho experience RDS, and those who experience complica-tions associated with ventilation such as pneumothorax,hypercarbia, and acidosis (deVries, 2011). PVH/IVH occurs in 30%-40% of infants weighing less than 1,500 grams and less than 32 weeks' gestation. Veryfew full-term neonates hemorrhages occurwithin the first week of life, with 90% occurring within 72 hours after birth (Lynam & Verklan, 2010; Malusky &Donze, 2012). There are four grades of intraventricular hemorrhage based on the extent of involvement; the higher the grade, the higherthe risk for long-term I: more than 50% of the ventricle Grade IV: Extension of blood into cerebral tissue orparenchymal involvement Risk factors for PVH/IVH:Prematurity, birth at less than 34 weeks' gestation Amniotic fluid infection Perinatal asphyxia RDS, or respiratory failure necessitating ventilatory support Increased arterial pressure Low 5-minute Apgar score Maternal general anesthesia Low birth weight Alteration of blood pressure, either hypotension hyper-tension Acidosis, hypercarbia Low hematocrit Pneumothorax (Lynam & Verklan, 2010) long-term prognosis often depends on the severity ofthe hemorrhage and includes:A death rate of 5% for small 15% for moderatehemorrhage, and 50% for hemorrhage small hemorrhage, and 80% with a severe hemorrhagewill exhibit neurodevelopment problems such as cerebralpalsy and delayed mental development. Approximately 50% of premature infants do not experienceneurological problems, and 25%-30% of very low birthweight neonates who had PVH/IVH do not exhibit neu-rodevelopment problems (Lynam & Verklan, 2010). Assessment Findings Sudden change in condition Bradycardia Oxygen desaturation Hypotonia Metabolic acidosis neonates. This disease results in inflammation andnecrosis of the bowel, usually the proximal colon or terminalileum (Bradshaw, 2010). Preterm neonates are predisposed toNEC because of multiple factors, including:Altered blood flow regulation, particularly to the intestines Impaired gastrointestinal host defense when faced withstress/injury to the intestinal tissue Alterations in the inflammatory response (Caplan, 2011)The majority (90%) of NEC cases are among preterm neonates; 5%-10% of cases occur in neonates who were bornat 37 weeks or more gestation (Bradshaw, 2010). In termneonates NEC is usually associated with a particular problem(e.g., asphyxia, intrauterine growth restriction) resulting in anischemic episode in the bowel (Caplan, 2011).Causes of intestinal ischemia/asphyxia arteriosus (Bradshaw, 2010). Risk factors for NECPrematurity is the most common risk factor for NEC.Roughly 90% of cases occur among premature neonates. Bacterial colonization can occur from contaminated naso-gastric feeding tubes among premature neonates receivingformula. Umbilical catheter placement (Bradshaw, 2010) Long-term outcomes include:Approximately 30% of neonates with NEC will die. 30% will have mild NEC and recover with medical management. An estimated 25% of neonates with NEC will developbowel obstruction. Short bowel syndrome may occur in neonates who havehad surgical treatment. Neurodevelopmental problems such as cerebral palsy maydevelop (Caplan, 2011). Assessment Findings Symptoms typically begin between 3 and 10 days after birth.Apnea, bradycardia, and tachycardia Respiratory failure Hypoxemia Unstable temperature Hypotension, shock Abdominal distention, bloody stools, abdominal tender-ness, vomiting, increased gastric residuals, discolorationof abdomen, visible bowel loops Lethargy Abnormally high or low white blood cell count, throm-bocytopeniaHyperglycemia (Lynam & Verklan, 2010) Signs that bleeding is worsening include:Apnea Increased need for ventilator support Drop in blood pressure Acidosis Seizures Full and tense fontanels and rapid increase in head size Diminished activity or level of consciousness (Lynam &Verlan, 2010) Medical Management Assessments for signs of hemodynamic, neurological, andbehavior changes Diagnostic testsCranial ultrasounds for all high-risk neonates within thefirst week of life to assess for PVH/IVH Lumbar puncture to assist in evaluation of PVH/IVH.Cerebrospinal fluid is analyzed for red blood cells, xan-thochromia, decreased glucose, and increased protein(Lynam & Verklan, 2010). Electroencephalogram (EEG) to evaluate seizure activity Laboratory testsHemoglobin and hematocrit to evaluate extent of bleeding Blood transfusions as indicated Nursing Actions Nursing actions for neonates with PVN/IVH are similar toactions for preterm neonates, with additional emphasis on thefollowing:Assess for changes in vital signs, behavior, and neuro-logical status, which may indicate increase intracranialbleeding. Reduce stress to neonate by maintaining a quiet and darkenvironment. Administer fluid volume replacement slowly to minimizefluctuation in blood pressure. Evidence-Based Practice: Neutral HeadPositioning to Prevent IVH Malusky, S., & Donze, A. (2011). Neutral head positioning premature infantsfor intraventricular hemorrhage prevention: An evidence-based review. Neonatal Network, 30, 381-396. Shifts in cerebral perfusion have been linked to the develop-ment of IVH, and many seemingly benign care activities, such ashead positioning, have been linked to changes in cerebral bloodflow patterns. Articles reviewed examined the connectionbetween the effects of head tilting on brain hemodynamics andchanges in the infant's potential ability to autoregulate cerebralblood flow adequately. Based on the physiological data and the views of experts in the field, implementing midline or neutral head positioning at a30-degree elevation in the head of bed in infants less than 32 weeks' gestation for the first 72 hours of life is recommendedto reduce the incidence of IVH.3704_Ch17_439-486 16/09/13 10:20 AM Page 5 Neonatal Period 452 electrolyte levels Metabolic acidosis Abdominal x-ray films of neonates with NEC may showdistention of the intestines with gas; gas in one part ofthe intestine, and lack of gas in other parts; air in the wallof the intestine and/or the portal venous system; dilatedloops of bowel; and air in abdomen (Bradshaw, 2010). Medical Management Diagnostic testsAbdominal x-ray exam to assist in evaluation of NEC Laboratory testsBlood cultures to assess for infection related to perforationof bowel MedicationsAntibiotics Analgesia Antihypertensives Discontinuation of feedings and starting gastric decom-pression Intravenous fluids Surgical intervention for the removal of necrotic bowel,resection of bowel, or for perforation of bowel related toNEC. A temporary colostomy may be performed. Nursing Actions Nursing actions for neonates with NEC are similar toactions for preterm neonates with additional emphasis onthe following:Assess for abdominal distention, visible bowel loops,emesis, and bloody stools.Early recognition and prompt treatment increase thechances for medical management. Withhold feedings as per orders and obtain intravenousaccess. Perform gastric decompression as per orders by placingan orogastric tube and connecting it to low suction. Monitor intake and output.Maintain circulating blood volume Prepare the neonate and family for surgery when indicated. Retinopathy of Prematurity Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) occurs in premature neonates who are less than 28 weeks' gestation. Before thisage, the retina is not completely vascularized and is suscepti-ble to stress or injury (Phelps, 2011). If injury or exposure toa stressor occurs, the normal vascularization of the retina maybe interrupted. Vasoproliferation, an abnormal growth of vas-culature, occurs when tissue grows within the retina, orextends into the vitreous body. Ultimately, abnormal vascu-larization and associated bleeding, and fluid leakage, causescar tissue that pulls and distorts the retina and displaces themacula (Phelps, 2011). It also causes retinal folds and can leadto retinal detachment (Phelps, 2011). The incidence of ROP is related to gestational age and birth weight. ROP occurs primarily in neonates less than 28 weeks' gestation and in up to 82% of neonates weighingless than 1000 grams (Askin & Deihl-Jones, 2010b). Long- term outcome for this disease depends on the extent of itsprogression, and ranges from full recovery to blindness(Phelps, 2011).Risk factors for ROPPrematurity and low birth weight are primary problemsassociated with ROP; the risk of ROP increases as gesta-tional age and birth weight decrease. Prolonged hyperoxia (exposure to high levels of oxygen),and duration of mechanical ventilation Hypoxia, hypercapnia, hypocapnia, arteriosus Multiple gestation Intraventricular hemorrhage Blood transfusion Maternal diabetes, bleeding, smoking, and hypertension(Askin & Deihl-Jones, 2010b; Phelps, 2011) Manifestations of ROP are primarily observed during an eye examination performed by a pediatric ophthalmolo-gist. The International Classification of Retinopathy ofPrematurity provides a system of five stages to classify ROP based on the severity of the disease. Stage 4 is partialretinal detachment, and stage 5, the most severe, is complete retinal detachment. The progression of ROP isvariable. An aggressive type of ROP, termed Rush disease,can manifest at 3-5 weeks post-delivery and progressquickly to complete detachment of the retina. In manycases, ROP evolves slowly and may take a year to becomestable (Phelps, 2011).Decreasing risk of ROP includes:Proper use of oxygen to maintain prescribed pulse oximetryparameters Continuous monitoring and assessments of pretermneonates on continuous oxygen therapy Careful use of oxygen during procedures such as suctioning Use of equipment such as oxygen blenders to ensure theexact concentration of oxygen Properly maintaining and calibrating oxygen systems(Askin & Diehl-Jones, 2010b) Long-term outcomes include:90% of neonates with ROP experience recovery with no orminimal loss of vision. Treatment modalities such as cryotherapy and laser therapy have decreased the risk of complications leadingto blindness. Complications such as glaucoma, strabismus, cataracts,amblyopia, retinal detachment, and blindness may occur. Corrective glasses may be needed to treat visual acuitydeficits (Askin & Diehl-Jones, 2010b; Phelps, 2011). Assessment Findings Retinal changes noted on ophthalmic examination3704_Ch17_439-486 16/09/13 10:20 AM Page 452CHAPTER 17 High-Risk Neonatal Nursing Care 453 Medical Management Eye evaluation for possible ROP completed by the pediatricophthalmologist for all neonates born before 29 weeks' gestation, or with a birth weight less than 1,500 grams atbirth. Neonates who weigh between 1500 grams and 2000 grams at birth with medical complications should alsoreceive an eye exam. The eye examination should occur at4-6 weeks after birth (Phelps, 2011). Neonates with imma-ture or abnormal vessel development should have repeatedeye exams to monitor progression of the disease (Askin &Diehl-Jones, 2010b). Treatment for ROP is determined by the extent ofabnormal vessel development and may include (Askin &Diehl-Jones, 2010b):Laser photocoagulation; laser is used to coagulate the avas-cular periphery of the retina to prevent vessel proliferation Cryotherapy; a supercooled probe is used to prevent vesselproliferation by freezing the avascular retina. Vitreoretinal surgery to reattach the retina if the retinabecomes detached Nursing Actions Reduce the risk for ROP.Administer oxygen to maintain prescribed pulse oximetryparameters. Use oxygen blenders and oxygen calibrating systems toensure exact concentration of oxygen. Avoid bright lights by keeping lighting in the nursery at alow level and by covering isolettes and cribs with blankets.altered oxygenation and nutrient transport, which increasesthe risk for hypoxia and hypoglycemia at the onset of labor. If the placenta continues to function well after term, the result may be a newborn who is large for gestational age(LGA). The risk of macrosomia, or a birth weight above 4000 to 4500 grams, increases when pregnancy is prolonged.Risk factorsAnencephaly History of postterm pregnancies First pregnancy Grand multiparous women Postmature neonates are at risk for:Meconium aspiration: The presence of meconium in theamniotic fluid related to fetal hypoxia places the neonate atrisk for meconium aspiration syndrome (discussed later inthis chapter). hypoxia related to placental insufficiency and adecrease in amniotic fluid, which increases the risk of cordcompression Neurological complications such as seizures related to fetalasphyxia during labor and birth due to alteration in oxygenation Hypoglycemia related to alteration in nutrient transportdue to decreased placental functioning Hypothermia related to: A lack of development of subcutaneous fat Loss of subcutaneous fat related to insufficient nutrienttranspor t through the placenta Polycythemia, a compensatory response, is caused by analteration in oxygenation associated with placental insuf-ficiency; hematocrit is considered poly-cythemia in a neonate (Diehl-Jones & Askin, 2010). Birth trauma related to macrosomia Assessment Findings Dry, peeling, cracked skin Lack of vernix Profuse hair Long fingernails Thin, wasted appearance Meconium staining (green or yellow staining on theinfant's skin, nail beds, or umbilical cord) Hypoglycemia Poor feeding behavior Medical Management Oxygen therapy administered for perinatal depression orrespiratory distress Hematocrit to assess for polycythemia Blood glucose monitoring for hypoglycemia Nursing Actions Assess the prenatal record and intrapartum history,including Apgar scores, for risk factors. Assess the neonate for:Gestational age with use of gestational age scoring system Birth trauma if neonate is macrosomicEvidence-Based Practice: Risk Reduction of Retinopathy of Prematurity S. (2010). Retinopathy of prematurity. Improving outcomes through evidence-based practice. Nursing for Women's Health, 14, 382-389. As ROP is a known cause of childhood blindness, it is criticalthat nurses working with premature infants understand currenttreatment and prevention. Retinopathy of prematurity iscaused by high concentrations of oxygen therapy. Evidence-based practice guidelines pertain to the management of supple-mental oxygen, specifically lower oxygen saturation ranges forpremature infants. Oxygen saturation target ranges in the mid80s to lower-mid 90s are safe and can reduce the severity ofROP in infants less than 32 weeks' gestation. POSTMATURE NEONATES A post-term neonate is a neonate who is delivered after the completion of 41 weeks' gestation. Postmaturity is related to ahigher risk of morbidity and mortality (Furdon & Benjamin,2010). The cause of postterm pregnancies is unknown.Placental insufficiency related to the aging of the placenta mayresult in postmaturity syndrome, in which the fetus begins touse its subcutaneous fat stores and glycemic stores (McGrath& Hardy, 2011). Placental function decreases, resulting 10:20 AM Page 453UNIT 5 Neonatal Period 454 Respiratory depression at the time of birth or within afew hours after birth Low Apgar scores Need for resuscitation after delivery due to perinataldepression Signs of respiratory distress such as nasal flaring, grunt-ing, chest retractions Chest may appear barrel shaped and overdistended. The expiration phase of breathing may be extended. Diminished air movement, and the presence of rales andrhonchi assessed on auscultation Atelectasis and hyperinflated areas through the lungsnoted on chest x-ray film Arterial blood gas findings may include low Pa O2despite administration of 100% oxygen, and respiratory andmetabolic acidosis in serious cases (Askin, 2010). Medical Management Suctioning of the oropharynx and the nasopharynx toremove meconium immediately after the delivery of theneonate's head and before the first breath is a commonpractice. Evidence does not support this practice as effective in preventing meconium aspiration (Blackburn,2013). Direct tracheal suctioning using a tracheal tube in casesin which the infant has a heart rate less than 100 beatsper minute, absent respirations, or poor muscle tone Arterial blood gases to determine respiratory status andto guide treatment (Askin, 2010). Chest x-ray exam Blood glucose monitoring Oxygen with or without assisted ventilation dependingon the neonate's condition. Surfactant therapy to decrease risk of need for ECMO(Dargaville, Copnell, Mills, & Haron, 2011). Sedatives or paralytic agents to relax neonates who arereceiving ventilation (Askin, 2010). Antibiotics to treat pneumonia Nursing Actions Assist with suctioning and resuscitation at the time ofdelivery. Perform a physical assessment to evaluate neonate for:Respiratory distress Cyanosis Complications of meconium hypocalcemia, pneumonia, pneu-mothorax, bronchopulmonary and persistentpulmonary hypertension Neurological problems secondary to asphyxia (Askin,2010). Administer oxygen and/or assisted ventilation as perorder. Monitor blood glucose as per order.Complication of respiratory distress is an increased meta-bolic rate and thus a higher incidence of hypoglycemia. Manage ECMO as per order.Respiratory distress (e.g., grunting, nasal flaring, cyanosis ispresent Signs of meconium staining Blood glucose levels Vital signs Weight Gross anomalies Monitor for signs of hypoglycemia.Jitteriness, irritability, poor feeding, apnea, grunting,lethargy Provide early and frequent feedings if respiratory status isstable.Early and frequent feedings reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Monitor intake and output.Postterm infants may be poor feeders and thus are at riskfor inadequate fluid intake MECONIUM ASPIRATION SYNDROME Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) is a cause of respira-tory failure in term and postterm neonates. The fetus maypass meconium stool into the amniotic fluid. This occurswhen there is a relaxation of the fetal anal sphincter, usuallydue to fetal asphyxia in utero, but can also occur with breechpresentations and in cephalic presentations without evidenceof asphyxia (Blackburn, 2013). Meconium is released into theamniotic fluid in roughly 4%-14% of deliveries and in about5%-11% of these cases, meconium aspiration syndromeoccurs (Blackburn, 2013; Askin, 2010). There is a risk that the fetus can aspirate the meconium- stained fluid at the time of delivery. The presence of meconium fluid in the neonate's lungs can cause a partialobstruction of the lower airways that leads to a trapping of air and a hyperinflation of the airway distal to theobstruction, causing uneven ventilation (Blackburn, 2013).The presence of meconium in the lungs can also cause achemical pneumonitis and inhibit surfactant action(Blackburn, 2013). These changes neonate at riskfor atelectasis.Complications related to meconium aspiration:Obstruction of the airway Hyperinflation of the alveoli due to the trapping of air Chemical pneumonia Decreased surfactant proteins Hemorrhagic pulmonary edema that interferes with sur-factant production (Askin, 2010). Assessment Findings Meconium-stained amniotic fluid Meconium visualized below the vocal cords Greenish or yellowish discoloration of the skin, nail beds,and umbilical cord3704_Ch17_439-486 16/09/13 10:20 AM Page 454CHAPTER 17 High-Risk Neonatal Nursing Care 455 PERSISTENT PULMONARY HYPERTENSION OF THE NEWBORN Normally after birth there is relaxation of the pulmonary vas-cular bed, allowing blood circulation to the lungs. Persistentpulmonary hypertension (PPHN) results when the normalvasodilation and relaxation of the pulmonary vascular bed donot occur. This leads to elevated pulmonary vascular resis - tance, right ventricular hypertension, ovale ductus is or neonates who experience hypoxia/asphyxia,RDS, meconium such as diaphragmatic hernia (Steinhorn, precipitating factor is treated, vasoconstriction andincreased vascular resistance persist, andacidemia (Askin, 2010).Risk factors for PPHNHypoxia and are the most common risk factors forPPHN. RDS, meconium aspiration, pneumonia Bacterial sepsis Delayed circulatory transition at birth caused by factorssuch as delayed resuscitation, central nervous systemdepression, hypothermia Hypothermia or hypoglycemia leading to Polycythemia or hyperviscosity of the blood, which couldcause blockages in the pulmonary vascular bed Prenatal pulmonary hypertension associated with pre-mature closure of the ductus arteriosus, or fetal systemichypertension Underdevelopment of pulmonary vessels associated withcongenital anomalies of the lung or heart Abnormal development of pulmonary vessels associatedwith intrauterine asphyxia or intrauterine meconiumaspiration, which leads to increased muscularization ofpulmonary vessels that causes increased vascular resistance(Askin, 2010) Assessment Findings Term or near-term neonate Low Apgar scores Symptoms evident within 12 hours of birth Hypoxia and/or asphyxia at the time of birth Neonate depressed at birth, slow to breathe, difficultywith administering ventilation Tachypnea Chest retractions, grunting Low Pa O2, even with administration of high levels of oxygen Cyanosis Hypotension Heart murmur Pulmonary disorders such as air leaks, and bronchopul-monary dysplasia are possible complications of PPHN.Echocardiogram shows pulmonary hypertension, andenlarged right side of the heart. Congestive heart failure may occur. Hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia Metabolic acidosis Possible kidney damage, leading to decreased urine out-put, proteinuria, and hematuria Liver damage that may lead to blood clotting problems Hematological problems such as hemorrhage, disseminat-ed intravascular coagulation (DIC), and thrombocytope-nia may occur as of PPHN. Long-term outcomes after PPHN include:Hearing loss (sensorineural) Neurological deficits Chronic lung disease Death (Askin, 2010) Medical Management Rapid and efficient resuscitation at birth to preventhypoxia and acidosis Treat acidosis if present. Preductal and postductal blood gas to distinguish struc-tural heart problems from PPHN.Right to left shunting is suspected when there is a differ-ence of 10 mm Hg or more between the preductal andpostductal Pa O2(Askin, 2010). Chest x-ray Echocardiogram to evaluate for cardiac anomalies, rightto left shunting of blood, pulmonary resistance, and pulmonary artery pressures. Oxygen and conventional mechanical ventilationHyperoxygenation is often used to keep Pa O2levels above 90 mm Hg, and hyperventilation is used to keep Pa CO2 levels in the low normal range, to prevent acidosis, and pro-mote decreased pulmonary artery pressure. Hyperventilation causes alkalosis, which has been found to lower pulmonaryresistance (Askin, 2010). If conventional mechanical ventilation is ineffective, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation may be instituted. ECMO if other treatments are not effective Intravenous fluids Laboratory tests (complete blood count, glucose, elec-trolytes, calcium, arterial blood gases, blood cultures) Umbilical catheter for arterial and venous pressure monitoring, blood gas monitoring, and to administervasopressors as indicated Transcutaneous pulse oximetry monitoring Surfactant therapy Nitric oxide therapyNitric oxide induces vasodilation and reduces pulmonaryresistance. Use of nitric oxide has reduced the percentage of neonateswith PPHN being placed on ECMO. MedicationsVasopressors, such as dopamine and nitroprusside, todecrease right to left shunting by maintaining systemicvascular vascular a disproportional reduction in thesize of structures and organs, results from maternal orplacental conditions that occur later in pregnancy andimpede placental blood flow.Examples of conditions that may result include preeclampsia, placental infarcts, or severematernal malnutrition (Furdon & Benjamin, 2010). factorsInclude maternal, fetal, and placental factors (Table 17-3). Neonates with IUGR are at risk for:Labor intolerance related to placental insufficiency andinadequate nutritional and oxygen reserves Meconium aspiration related to asphyxia during labor(Askin, 2010) Hypoglycemia related to inadequate glycogen stores and reducedgluconeogenesis, and an increase in metabolic demands fromheat loss which diminishes glucose stores (Armentrout, 2010) Hypocalcemia, defined as serum calcium levels less than 7.5 mg/dL, related to birth asphyxia (Halbardier, 2010) Signs of hypocalcemia are often similar to those of hypo-glycemia and include jitteriness, t etany, and seizures. Assessment Findings Physical characteristics of the IUGR neonate include:Large head in relationship to the body Long nails Large anterior fontanel Decreased amounts of Wharton's jelly present in theumbilical cord Thin extremities and trunk Loose skin due to a lack of subcutaneous fat Skin that may be dry, flaky, and meconium stained Weight, head circumference, and length are all below the10th percentile for gestational age in symmetric IUGR(Furdon & Benjamin, 2010). Head circumference and length are appropriate for gestational age; however, the weight is below the 10thpercentile for the baby's gestational age in asymmetricIUGR (Furdon & Benjamin, 2010). RDS may occur in SGA neonates who are born prema-turely or have 2010). Hypothermia related to decreased subcutaneous fat andglucose supply, impaired lipid metabolism, and depletedbrown fat stores (Furdon & Benjamin, 2010). Polycythemia Medical Management Identify IUGR during pregnancy and intervene based onthe cause. Assessments for congenital anomalies Oxygen therapy for perinatal depression and respiratorydistress Laboratory testsBlood glucose monitoring Hematocrit if polycythemia is calcium such and topromote pulmonary relaxants, such as Pavulon, to induce paralysisamong neonates who resist ventilation Sedatives and analgesics, such as morphine and Versed(midazolam) Antibiotic therapy to decrease risk of and/or treat infection Nursing Actions Review maternal prenatal, intrapartal, and neonatal histories. Assess the neonate for respiratory distress, meconiumaspiration, and clinical manifestations of PPHN. Administer oxygen and mechanical ventilation asordered. Monitor vital signs and pulse oximetry. Anticipate the placement of umbilical catheters.Vasoconstriction makes peripheral intravenous access difficult. Arterial blood gases and lab values are easily accessed viaan umbilical catheter, thus preventing the infant fromreceiving painful heelsticks and venipunctures. Multiple intravenous fluids and medications can beadministered simultaneously via umbilical catheters. Administer IV fluids as per order. Administer medications as per order. Obtain and monitor results of laboratory tests.Immediate intervention is required for abnormal labresults. Keep handling, treatments, suctioning, and stimulation toa minimum, as these can result in decreased Pa O2levels, and vasoconstriction. Provide emotional support for parents, incorporate themin care of their infant, and keep them informed of theirinfant's condition. SMALL FOR GESTATIONAL AGE AND INTRAUTERINE GROWTH RESTRICTION A small for gestational age (SGA) infant is one whose weight is less than the 10th percentile for his or her gestational age.Neonates whose growth is not consistent with gestational agemay be affected by intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).IUGR is due to a decrease in cell production related to chron-ic malnutrition. There are two types of IUGR:Symmetric IUGR, a generalized proportional reduction inthe size of all structures and organs except for heart andbrain, is the result of a condition that occurs early in preg-nancy and affects general growth. When a complicationoccurs very early in pregnancy, fewer cells develop, leadingto smaller organ size (Furdon & Benjamin, 2010).Conditions that may result in symmetric IUGR includeexposure to teratogenic substances, congenital infections,and genetic problems (Furdon & Benjamin, 2010). Symmetric IUGR can be identified by ultrasound in theearly part of the second trimester.3704_Ch17_439-486 16/09/13 10:20 AM Page 456CHAPTER 17 High-Risk Neonatal Nursing Care 457 Nursing Actions Review prenatal and intrapartal records for risk factors.

Assess skin color for signs of polycythemia, whichappears as a red, ruddy skin color.Infants of diabetic mothers are at risk for polycythemia. Perform a gestational age assessment. Observe for jaundice.LGA infants are at higher risk for jaundice due to polycythemia. HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA Hyperbilirubinemia, high levels of bilirubin in the blood, is common among neonates (McGrath & Hardy, 2011). Whenserum bilirubin levels are greater than 5 mg/dL, neonates willexhibit visible signs of jaundice (Schwartz, Haberman, &Ruddy, 2011). The clinical significance of jaundice is basedon the age of the neonate in hours and the total serum biliru-bin level (Bradshaw, 2010). Prematurity may jaundice, and any jaundice amongpreterm neonates evaluated. A complication of hyperbilirubinemia is kernicterus. Kernicterus is an abnormal accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in the brain cells. Bilirubin accumulates within thebrain and becomes toxic to the brain tissue, which causes neu-rological disorders such as deafness, delayed motor skills,hypotonia, and intellectual deficits (Kaplan, Wong, Sibley, &Stevenson, 2011). A goal of medical and nursing actions is toprevent kernicterus through early identification and treatmentof hyperbilirubinemia. into physiological jaun- dice and pathological jaundice.LARGE FOR GESTATIONAL AGE A large for gestational age (LGA) infant is a neonate whoseweight is above the 90th percentile for his or her gestationalage. Characteristically LGA infants are macrosomic andhave greater body length and head circumference comparedto infants who are appropriate for gestational age (AGA)(Fig. 17-7). Risk factors for LGAMaternal diabetes Multiparity Previous macrosomic baby Prolonged pregnancy (McGrath & Hardy, 2011). LGA fetuses and neonates are at risk for:Cesarean births Operative vaginal delivery Shoulder dystocia Breech presentation Birth trauma Cephalopelvic disproportion Hypoglycemia Hyperbilirubinemia Assessment Findings Birth trauma related to shoulder dystocia or breech pres-entation. These birth traumas include:Fractured clavicle Brachial nerve damage Facial nerve damage Depressed skull fractures Cephalohematoma Intracranial hemorrhage Asphyxia (McGrath & Hardy, 2011). Poor feeding behavior Hypoglycemia Polycythemia in neonates of diabetic mothers related to adecrease in extracellular fluid and/or fetal hypoxia Figure 17-7 Large for gestational age (LGA) neonate.3704_Ch17_439-486 16/09/13 10:20 AM Page 458CHAPTER Jaundice Physiological jaundice results from hyperbilirubinemia thatcommonly occurs after the first 24 hours of birth and duringthe first week of life (Schwartz, Haberman, & Ruddy, 2011).Common physiological characteristics at risk for physiological jaundice:Neonates have an increased red blood cell volume. Neonatal red blood cells have a life span of 70-90 days,compared to 120 days in mg/kg/day) thanadults. Neonates reabsorb increased amounts of unconjugatedbilirubin in the intestine due to lack of intestinal bacte-ria, decreased gastrointestinal motility, and increased -glucuronidase (a have a decreased hepatic uptake of bilirubinfrom the plasma due to a deficiency of ligandin, the primary bilirubin binding protein in hepatocytes. Neonates have a diminished conjugation bilirubin inthe liver due to decreased glucuronyl transferase activity(Bradshaw, 2010). Risk Factors for Physiological Jaundice Asian, Native American, and Greek ethnicity Fetal hypoxia ABO incompatibility (the woman is blood type O andthe neonate is blood type A or B) Rh incompatibility (the woman is Rh negative and theneonate is Rh positive) Use of oxytocin during labor Delayed cord clamping, which increases red blood cellvolume Breastfeeding (Table 17-4) Delayed feedings, caloric deprivation, or large weight loss Bruising or cephalohematoma Gestational age of 35-38 weeks Maternal diabetes with macrosomiaEpidural Asphyxia Older sibling with jaundice Assessment Findings Physiological jaundice is typically visible after 24 hours of life (Schwartz, Haberman, & Ruddy, 2011) Jaundice is characterized by a yellowish tint to the skinand sclera of the eyes.As bilirubin levels rise, jaundice will progressfrom the newborn's head downward toward the trunk andlower extremities. Mean peak total serum bilirubin level is 5-6 mg/dL of full-term neonates between 48 and 120 hours of life amongwhite and African American neonates, and 10-14 mg/dLbetween 72 and 120 hours among Asian American new-borns (Kaplan, Wong, Sibley, & Stevenson, 2011). Declines to 3 mg/dL by the 5th day of life for white andAfrican American babies, and by 7-10 days of life forAsian physiological processes that lead to hyperbilirubinemia ofthe newborn. Such disorders can result in pathological uncon-jugated or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (Table 17-5). Assessment Findings Jaundice that occurs within the first 24 hours of life Total serum bilirubin levels above 12.9 mg/dL in a termneonate or 15 mg/dL in a preterm baby (Kaplan, Wong,Sibley, & Stevenson, 2011). Total serum bilirubin levels that increase by more than 5 mg/dL per day (Kaplan, Wong, Sibley, & Stevenson, 2011) Jaundice lasting more than 1 week in a term newborn, ormore than 2 weeks in a premature neonate (Kaplan,Wong, Sibley, & Stevenson, 2011) TABLE 17-4 HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA ASSOCIATED WITH BREASTFEEDING: A COMPARISON OF BREASTFEEDING VERSUS BREAST MILK JAUNDICE BREASTFEEDING JAUNDICEEarly onset of jaundice (within the first few of life)Associated with inef fective breastfeeding Dehydration reabsorption of bilirubin in the gut.

Blackburn (2013).BREAST MILK JAUNDICELate onset (after 3-5 days)Gradual increase in bilirubin that peaks at 2 weeks of ageAssociat ed with breast milk composition in some women that increases the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin Treatment: Continued breastfeeding in most infants. In some cases where bilirubin levels are excessively high, breastfeedingmay be interrupted and formula feedings are given for severaldays. This typically results in a decline of the bilirubin level.Breastfeeding is resumed when bilirubin levels decline.3704_Ch17_439-486 16/09/13 10:20 AM Page 459UNIT 5 Antiglobulin (Coombs') test: Test used to determine hemolyticdisease of the newborn related to Rh or ABO incompatibility Direct antiglobulin (Coombs') test is used to detectabnormal in vivo coating of the neonate's r ed bloodcells with antibody globulin (maternal antibodies);when present, the test is considered positive. Transcutaneous bilirubinometry, a noninvasive methodto estimate total serum bilirubin andnear-term is used to identify neonates at riskfor developing hyperbilirubinemia (McGrath & Hardy,2011). Complete blood count assists in management of pathologicaljaundice. Treatment is determined by the level of bilirubin and theage of the neonate in hours (Table 17-6). PhototherapyPhototherapy is the most widely used and effective treat-ment for hyperbilirubinemia. Various types of phototherapy delivery systems are avail-able, including blue lights, white lamps, halogen lamps,fiberoptic blankets, and blue light emitting diodes (LED). Evidence suggests that the most effective lights arethose in the blue-green spectrum. (Schwar stool without conjugation in the liver (Swartz,Haberman, & 2011). serum bilirubin levels should drop 1-2 mg/dL within 4-6 hours after the initiation of phototherapy. Phototherapy should be administered continuously, exceptduring feeding times or parental visits, when eye patchesare removed to allow for bonding. Exchange transfusion is used in cases where phototherapyis not effective or severe hemolytic disease is present(McGrath & Hardy, 2011).In this procedure, approximately 85% of the neonate's redblood cells are replaced with donor cells. This procedure reduces bilirubin, removes red blood cells coatedwith maternal antibody, corrects anemia, and removes othertoxins associated with hemolysis (McGrath & Hardy, 2011). Efforts to prevent Rh hemolytic disease with Rhimmunoglobulin (RhoGam) administered to Rh-negativewomen, and the use of phototherapy, have diminished theneed for exchange transfusion (McGrath & Hardy, 2011).TABLE 17-5 CAUSES OF PATHOLOGICAL incompatibilitiesBact erial vir al infections Inherited disorders of red blood cell/bilirubin metabolism Glucose-6-phospate dehydrogenase deficiency SEQUESTERED BLOOD:CephalohematomaBruisingHemangiomasCerebral, liver and biliar y tr act TABLE 17-6 MANAGEMENT OF HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA INTHE HEALTHY TERM AND NEAR-TERM NEONATE AGE (HR) PHOTOTHERAPY 24 25-48 12 15 49-72 15 18 >72 17 20 American Academy of Pediatrics (2004).3704_Ch17_439-486 16/09/13 10:20 AM Page 460CHAPTER 17 High-Risk Neonatal Nursing Care 461 Infants discharged before 72 hours of life should be seenfor follow-up by a health care provider within 1-2 days toassess the neonate's health status and to assess for jaundice.Timely identification of significant hyperbilirubinemia iskey to preventing acute bilirubin encephalopathy (Kaplan,Wong, Sibley, & Stevenson, 2011) Nursing Actions for Hyperbilirubinemia Review maternal and neonatal record for risk factors. Review laboratory findings, such as neonatal blood type;Rh factor; and indirect and direct Coombs'. Assess degree of jaundice every shift with the use of atranscutaneous meter (McGrath & Hardy, 2011).When meter is not available, in a well-lit area, use yourfingers to blanch the neonate's skin on the face, uppertrunk, abdomen, thigh, and lower leg and feet. The skinwill appear yellow after the pressure is released and beforereturn of normal skin color. Document the assessment findings.How rapidly the degree of jaundice progresses guides themethod of treatment Notify the physician if jaundice is present. Prompt treatment is essential to preventing bilirubin toxicity. Obtain serum bilirubin levels.The rate of rise of the bilirubin level is critical in deter-mining the treatment needed. Ensure adequate hydration by feeding neonate every 2-3 hours to promote excretion of bilirubin in the urineand stool, and to compensate for insensible water lossdue to phototherapy (McGrath & Hardy, 2011).Early feedings decrease the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin,which decreases bilirubin levels (McGrath & Hardy, 2011). Implement phototherapy as ordered and provide relatednursing care (see Critical Component: Care of theNeonate Receiving Phototherapy).Proper nursing care enhances the effectiveness of photother-apy and minimizes complications. Assess for side effects of phototherapy:Eye damage Loose stools Dehydration Hyperthermia Lethargy Skin rashes Abdominal distention Hypocalcemia Lactose intolerance Thrombocytopenia Bronze baby syndrome Provide verbal and written discharge instructions abouthow to identify signs of jaundice in an infant and whento notify the physician.For those infants discharged with mild jaundice, teachingshould include measures to assess hydration, excretion ofbilirubin, and home management of phototherapy lights ifapplicable. Care of the Neonate Fluorescent lights\" should be positioned 18-20 inchesfrom the infant. Fluorescent lights should be positioned 2 inches from thetop of an incubator. A photometer should be used to measure irradiance oflamps to facilitate optimal treatment. Banks of lights should be covered by Plexiglas. The neonate should be placed under lights with only a diaperin place, for maximal exposure to light. Eye patches are placed on infant to protect eyes from theeffects of the light. During feedings, eye patches are removed and the neonateshould be held by a parent or the nurse. Change the neonate's position frequently to facilitateincreased exposure to the light. Vital signs including temperature monitoring should be doneper agency protocol. Monitor intake and output. Phototherapy results inincreased insensible fluid loss. Feedings every 2-3 hours are important to provide adequatefluids to compensate for insensible fluid loss, and promoteexcretion of bilirubin. Monitor newborn for side effects of phototherapy.

Injury theresult of intracranial hemorrhage (Table andischemia during the prenatal and intrapartal periods, andpost-birth; systemic chronic fetal compromise such as IUGR;or hypotension that leads to a decreased cerebral perfusionresulting in preventricular leukomalacia (Table 17-8). Depending on the extent and location of the injury, CNS injuries may result in normal outcomes or serious long-termproblems such as seizures, neurological deficits, developmen-tal disability, motor deficits, visual impairments, or death(Lynam & Verklan, 2010).Risk factors for CNS injuriesPrematurityBirth trauma Breech delivery or other malpresentations Precipitous labor Difficult labor, traumatic delivery, and use of forceps Hypoxia, asphyxia, hypotension, ischemia, respiratory distress. Hypoxic events may be related to: Maternal causes such as cardiac arrest and hypovolemicshock Uteroplacental causes such as placental abruption,cord pr olapse, as cardiac arrhythmia (Levene & deVries, 2011) Assessment Findings Clinical manifestations are specific to the type and extent of the CNS injury (see Tables 17-7 and 17-8).

Perform physical assessment of the neonate, includingevaluation of tone, reflexes, and behavior. Notify physician of abnormal findings. Administer oxygen as per order. Obtain laboratory tests as per order. Ensure that ordered diagnostic tests are completed. Assist with diagnostic procedures such as lumbar puncture. Administer medications as per order. Monitor temperature closely of infants undergoing cool-ing therapy. Provide the family with support and information abouttheir infant's status, treatment, and follow-up. INFANTS OF MOTHERS WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES Diabetes is the most common chronic medical problem affect-ing pregnant women (Hay, 2012). Maternal diabetes duringpregnancy is associated with poor outcomes for the fetus andTABLE 17-8 TYPES OF extent of injury.

Complications of high maternallevels of glucose during pregnancy are:Congenital anomalies:Cardiac anomalies, such as transposition of the great ves-sels, ventricular septal defect, and left to right ventricularwall defects, such as sacral agenesis and neural tubedefects Small left colon syndrome and anomalies (Hay, 2012) IUGR, perinatal asphyxia, and SGA neonates due to pla-cental insufficiency related to maternal vascular disease in woman with type 1 diabetes of long duration(Armentrout, 2010) Risk for RDS due to delay in surfactant production relat-ed to the high maternal glucose levels and fetal hyper-stimulation (Armentrout, 2010) Risk of hypoglycemia during the first few hours of lifedue to increased levels of fetal and neonatal insulin anddecreased circulating glucose after delivery Neurological damage and seizures related to inadequateglucose supply to the brain due to neonatal hyperinsulinism Risk for hyperbilirubinemia related to polycythemia dueto insulin-induced increases in metabolism that leads tohypoxia (Armentrout, 2010). Risk of shoulder dystocia during the birthing processrelated to macrosomia Risk of childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes (Hay, 2012). Assessment Findings Macrosomia due to fetal exposure to elevated maternalglucose levels. In response to high glucose levels, the fetalpancreas produces insulin. Hyperinsulinemia results inincreased fat production and growth (Hay, 2012). Fractured clavicle and brachial nerve damage related Hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia Polycythemia Hyperbilirubinemia Low muscle tone Poor feeding abilities Medical Management Assess for complications associated with maternal diabetes. Laboratory tests such as hematocrit and calcium andmagnesium levels. X-ray exams if clinically indicated for birth traumarelated to shoulder dystocia. Consult the cardiologist if cardiac anomalies are suspected. Monitor blood glucose. Abnormal results are confirmedby laboratory analysis of plasma glucose (Armentrout,2010). If the neonate is hypoglycemic, blood glucose levels should be monitored 30 minutes after feeding toevaluate response to treatment (Miller & Morris, 2011). Early (by 1-2 hours of age) and frequent oral feedingsof breast milk or formula unless the neonate feedspoorly or is too sick to be fed orally. If oral feedings arecontraindicated and/or the neonate is hypoglycemic,10% dextrose and water is administered intravenously(Miller & Morris, 2011). Nursing Actions Assess neonate for signs of respiratory distress, birth trau-ma, congenital anomalies, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia,polycythemia, and hyperbilirubinemia. Monitor blood glucose per agency protocol.May require intravenous fluids along with feedings tomaintain adequate blood glucose levels Provide early and frequent feedings to treat and preventhypoglycemia.May be passive, lethargic, and difficult to arouse (Miller& Morris, 2011) Oral feeding skills must be assessed and supported. Gavage feedings may be indicated. Obtain laboratory tests as per orders. Maintain a neutral thermal environment to reduce energyneeds (Miller & Morris, 2011). NEONATAL INFECTION Infections among neonates are a leading cause of morbidityand mortality. The immune system of a neonate is imma-ture, placing the newborn at risk for infection during thefirst several months of life. Neonates can be exposed toinfection via vertical or horizontal transmission (Lott,2010). Vertical transmission of infection, the passing of infection from the mother to the baby, can occur in several ways:Transplacental transfer: Infection, such as syphilis, istransmitted to the fetus through the placenta. Ascending infection: Infection ascends into the uterusrelated to prolonged rupture of membranes. Intrapartal exposure: The neonate is exposed to infectionduring the birth process (e.g., herpes virus).Horizontal transmission (nosocomial infection) is an infection that is transmitted from hospital equipment or staffto the neonate (Lott, 2010). Infections may be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungus, yeast, spirochetes (syphilis), and protozoa (Table 17-9). Infections may affect specific organ systems such as respiratory, urinary tract, brain, gastrointestinal tract, and skin; or local sites such as the umbilical stump and eyes. Neonates may develop systemic infections (sepsis)(Edwards, 2011).Early-onset sepsis occurs within the first 7 days of life. It is a serious, overwhelming infection that is typicallyacquired through vertical transmission from the mother(Edwards, 2011). Late-onset sepsis occurs after 7 days of life and is associ-ated with a lower mortality rate than early-onset sepsis. Very late onset sepsis affects premature, very low birthweight babies, after 3 months of age. This sepsis is related3704_Ch17_439-486 16/09/13 10:20 AM Page 465UNIT 5 Neonatal Period 466 to long-term use of equipment such as indwelling cathetersand endotracheal tubes (Edwards, 2011). Risk factorsThere are several maternal, neonatal, and environmentalfactors that predispose a neonate to infection (Table 17-10). Group B Streptococcus Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the primary cause of neonatal meningitis and sepsis in the United States (Field, 2011).Approximately 15%-40% of all pregnant women are asympto-matic carriers of GBS, which is found in the urogenital andlower gastrointestinal tract (Field, 2011). Evidence supportsthe use of antibiotics during labor among women who havepositive cultures for GBS during pregnancy in reducing verticaltransmission of GBS, and early-onset GBS sepsis (Edwards,2011). The following are recommendations established by theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2010) toprevent perinatal Group B streptococcal disease:All pregnant women should be routinely screened forvaginal and rectal GBS colonization at 35-37 weeks' ges-tation. Women who are positive for GBS should be givenprophylactic antibiotics at the time of labor or rupture ofmembranes. Women who were GBS positive during pregnancy, orhave delivered a previous baby with GBS infection, orwomen with membranes rupture before 37 weeks' gesta-tion, should be given penicillin during the intrapartumperiod without obtaining a GBS culture. If GBS status is not known at the time of rupture ofmembranes or labor onset, prophylactic antibioticsshould be administered if: (a) membranes have beenruptured for 18 hours or more, (b) gestational age is lessthan 37 weeks, or (c) maternal temperature is 100.4\u00b0F(38\u00b0C) or higher. Women with positive GBS cultures who have a plannedcesarean section before rupture of membranes or theonset of labor should not receive routine prophylaxis forperinatal GBS prevention. For intrapartum chemoprophylaxis, penicillin G is rec-ommended at an initial dose of 5 million units intra-venously (IV), followed by 2.5 million units every 4 hoursuntil delivery. Ampicillin can be used as an alternativeand is given at an initial dose of 2 g IV followed by 1 gIV every 4 hours until delivery. Women who are allergicto penicillin but are not at high risk for anaphylaxis aregiven cefazolin IV. Erythromycin or clindamycin IV mayalso be used if the GBS isolate is not resistant to thesemedications. Neonates of women who received intrapartum chemopro-phylaxis do not require routine antibiotic administration,unless they exhibit signs of sepsis. Asymptomatic infants of mothers who received prophylac-tic antibiotics and who are less than 35 weeks' gestation atthe time of delivery should be evaluated with a completeblood count with differential, and blood cultures. Theseneonates should be observed in the hospital for at least 48 hours. Infants at any gestational age who exhibit signs of infec-tion should have a complete blood count (CBC) with adifferential, blood cultures, and a chest x-ray exam if respiratory symptoms are present (Edwards, 2011).TABLE 17-9 CAUSES OF Neonatal Care 467 Antibiotics (ampicillin and gentamicin) should be startedimmediately after blood cultures are obtained. Neonates who are term, who appear to be healthy, andwhose mothers received 4 or more hours of antibioticprophylaxis can be discharged after 24 hours if they meetall other discharge criteria. Assessment Findings for Neonatal Infections Signs of infection in a newborn are often nonspecific andsubtle (Table 17-11). Laboratory findings suggestive of infection include:Leukocytosis: An elevated white blood cell count (WBC>25,000/mm 3) Leukopenia: A low white blood cell count (WBC<1,750/mm 3) Neutrophilia: Increased neutrophil count Neutropenia: Decreased neutrophil count (<1,500/mm3) is strongly predictive of infection. An immature to total neutrophil ratio greater than 0.20 issuggestive of infection. Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count <100,000/mm 3 can be related to viral infection or bacterial sepsis (Lott, 2010). Medical Management Monitor for clinical signs of infection. Laboratory tests if the neonate exhibits manifestations ofinfection or is at risk for infection:CBC including a differential to evaluate white blood cell countsMicrobial cultures of the blood, urine, and CSF Neonatal sepsis can be diagnosed definitively only with apositive blood culture (Edwards, 2011). Urine and CSF cul- tures may also be obtained when sepsis is suspected. Othercultures are obtained as clinically indicated (e.g., skin). C-reactive protein levels (CRP) may be measured every12 hours to detect inflammation associated with infection(Lott, 2010). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for bacterial orviral DNA allows for identification of a specific bacterialor viral gene segment (Lott, 2010). Antibiotic therapy, if indicated for suspected sepsis aftercultures are obtained (Lott, 2010).Antibiotics, such as ampicillin and aminoglycosides, thatprovide broad-spectrum coverage are often started initially(Lott, 2010). If culture results are negative, antibiotics will be stoppedafter 48-72 hours. If sepsis is confirmed, antibiotics continue for 10-14 days,and 21 days for meningitis (Lott, 2010). If it is determined the infection is not bacterial in nature,appropriate antiviral or antifungal medications areordered (Edwards, 2011). The dosage and frequency of medication administration aredependent on the neonate's weight, gestational age, postna-tal age, and liver and kidney function (Edwards, 2011). Intravenous fluid and parenteral nutrition Monitor glucose and electrolytes. Ventilation as indicated (Edwards, 2011)TABLE 17-10 RISK FACTORS FOR NEONATAL INFECTION MATERNAL FACTORSPoor prenatal nutritionLow socioeconomic statusSubst ance abuse History of sexually of careProlonged rupture of membranes (>12-18 hours)Vaginal Streptococcus colonization deliveryPremature laborDifficult or prolonged laborMaternal urinary tract infectionInvasive humidif ication in incubator or ventilator y care Routine use of broad-spectrum antibiotics3704_Ch17_439-486 16/09/13 10:20 AM Page 467UNIT 5 Neonatal Period 468 Nursing Actions Assess maternal and neonatal histories for factors thatmay place a neonate at risk for infection, such as maternalGroup B Streptococcus status. Assess vital signs and adequacy of feedings, and moni-tor intake and output and weight, per agency protocol. Assess neonate for signs of infection (see Table 17-11). Notify the physician if the neonate demonstrates signs ofinfection. Early recognition and treatment of neonatal infec-tion is important in preventing morbidity and mortality. Provide respiratory support as per orders. Monitor glucose and electrolytes. Obtain laboratory tests as per order. Assist with diagnostic tests such as lumbar puncture for CSF.CSF is obtained and sent to lab for a Gram stain and culture. Holding the infant still in a flexed position is imperativefor a successful lumbar puncture. Administer antibiotics as per orders. Administer intravenous fluid and parenteral nutrition asper orders. Wash hands before handling equipment and caring forthe neonate. Provide parents with information about the neonate'sstatus, infection prevention strategies such as hand-washing before contact with the baby, and diagnostictests and treatments as appropriate. Include the following in discharge teaching for parents:identification of signs and symptoms of infection, whatsigns/symptoms should be reported to the physician,how to prevent infection, and scheduling a follow-upappointment before discharge. SUBSTANCE ABUSE EXPOSURE In the United States, 4.4% of pregnant women report use ofillicit drugs, 10.8% report use of alcohol, and 16.3% report useof tobacco (SAMHSA, 2010). Perinatal use of illicit drugs,alcohol, and tobacco has both short-term and long-termeffects on the developing fetus (Table 17-12). Women who use illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco are at higher risk for:No or inadequate prenatal care Inadequate prenatal weight gain Sexually transmitted infections Obstetrical complications (e.g., preterm labor and abruptio placentae) Severe mood swings Assessment Findings Effects of perinatal maternal substance use on theneonate are specific to the substance that has been used (see Table 17-12). Younger gestational age correlates with a lower risk for neonatal withdrawal. Neonatal abstinence syndrome (neonatal withdrawal) may result from intrauterine exposure to various substances, including opioids such as heroin,methadone, oxycodone, and Demerol; See Critical Component: Signs of NeonatalWithdrawal.The extent to which a newborn exhibits drug withdrawalis dependent on several factors (e.g., timing of the last exposure, type of substance, and the half life of the substance;AAP, 2012). Neonates exposed to alcohol in utero may demonstratewithdrawal symptoms within 3-12 hours after birth(AAP, 2012). Neonates exposed to narcotics in utero exhibit withdrawal within 48-72 hours after birth. Neonates exposed to barbiturates in utero exhibit withdrawal between days 1 and 14 (AAP, 2012). Alcohol use during pregnancy can cause a wide range of problems from no effect to major long-term TABLE 17-11 SIGNS OF NEONATAL INFECTION THERMO- CARDIO- 17 High-Risk Neonatal Nursing Care 469 CRITICAL COMPONENT Signs of Neonatal Withdrawal Apnea Behavior irregularities Diarrhea Dysmature swallowing Excessive crying Excessive/frantic sucking skin Fever High-pitched cry Hyperreflexia Hypertonia Irritability/restlessness Lacrimation Nasal congestion Poor feeding Seizures Skin mottling Sleep problems Sneezing Sweating Tachypnea Tremors Vomiting Wakefulness Weight loss or failure to gain weight Yawning (Pitts, 2010)disabilities (Pitts, 2010).

Physical assessment of the neonate, including observationfor physical and behavioral effects of prenatal substance use. Toxicology screening of the neonate's urine and/or meconium. Diagnostic tests such as cranial ultrasound and EEG, if indicated by clinical manifestations of withdrawalsymptomsProblems such as infection and hypoglycemia may manifestsymptoms similar to those of neonatal withdrawal andshould be ruled out by the appropriate diagnostic tests(AAP, 2012). Use of an assessment tool to determine signs of neonatalabstinence syndromeUse of the tool should be initiated within 2 hours of birth,and neonates should be assessed for signs of withdrawalevery 4 hours (Pitts, 2010). Use tool to guide decisions about when a neonate should beevaluated for treatment with medication (Pitts, 2010). Pharmacological therapy is considered if seizures, exces-sive weight loss, dehydration, poor feeding, diarrhea,vomiting, fever, and inability to sleep occur (AAP, 2012). Medications to treat withdrawal in neonates include:Methadone, morphine, paregoric, tincture of opium, clonidine, and diazepam, for opioid withdrawal Benzodiazepines to treat withdrawal from alcohol Phenobarbital for hyperactive behavior associated withnarcotic withdrawal; also used for withdrawal from non-narcotic agents Chlorpromazine for babies exhibiting gastrointestinaland CNS effects of narcotic withdrawal (AAP, 2012;Pitts, 2010) Frequent, small feedings with a high calorie formula (22-24 calories/oz.).Monitor feedings, output, and weight daily. Patient education regarding substance use and breastfeedingBreastfeeding is contraindicated if a woman is activelyusing any of the following substances: cocaine, metham-phetamines, alcohol, heroin, marijuana (Pitts,2010). Breastfeeding is not contraindicated with methadone use(AAP, 2012). Infants of mothers on methadone must beweaned gradually to avoid withdrawal (Pitts, 2010). Women who smoke cigarettes should be advised to quit andbe given information about cessation resources. Womenwho choose to continue to smoke should be taught to avoidsmoking around the baby, to smoke immediately afterbreastfeeding and not before, and to cut down on the number of cigarettes that they smoke (Pitts, 2010). Comprehensive follow-up care for the mother of thebaby or the foster mother before discharge. Infantsexposed to substances prenatally often need long-terminterdisciplinary physical and developmental care (Pitts, 2010).Referrals must be made to the appropriate departmentsand agencies (Pitts, 2010). In many health care settings,health care providers obtain a social service consult forwomen who have a history of substance use. Notificationof agencies such as Child Protective Services is dependenton laws of each state. In some states, neonates who arepositive for prenatal substance exposure are placed infoster care. Nursing Actions Review maternal history, including risk factors of sub-stance use and history of current or past substance use. Assess the neonate, including gestational age. Assess for congenital anomalies and physical and behav-ioral signs of withdrawal/neonatal abstinence syndrome.TABLE 17-12 SUBSTANCES COMMONLY USED DURING PREGNANCY: SIGNS OF WITHDRAWAL AND SHORT- AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS\u2014cont'd POST-BIRTH EFFECTS/ SIGNS SUBSTANCE OF WITHDRAWAL SHORT- AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS INHALANTS Edwards (2011); Pitts (2010).Fetal dysmorphogenesis syndrome - similar to alcohol High-Risk Neonatal Nursing Care 473 Monitor vital signs. Obtain toxicology screening as per order.A clean catch urine or meconium sample may be ordered. Use a scoring tool to assess for signs of withdrawal onneonates who are at high risk for neonatal abstinencesyndrome (Fig. 17-8).Notify the physician if the score is outside of what is considered normal. The decision to treat with medication is based on theinfant's score. Care for neonates experiencing neonatal abstinencesyndrome:Assess feedings and weights: Increased activity,decreased sleep, irritability, loose stools, vomiting, andpoor feeding behavior may all result in increased caloricneeds. Provide frequent and small feedings: A higher calorie formula (22-24 cal/oz.) can be used to support increasedcaloric needs. Allow the neonate to rest during feedings. Position the neonate upright during feedings. Utilize nipples that have a slower flow if the infant has astro ng, frantic suck. Provide a pacifier to the neonate. Bathe the baby in warm water to treat increased tone andirritability. Swaddle neonate with arms close to the body. Provide a quiet environment, with lights dimmed, andminimize stimuli. Be sensitive to infant cues that indicate stress; minimizestress-inducing activities. Rock the neonate gently (AAP, 2012; Pitts, 2010). Care for the mother of a neonate with neonatal absti-nence syndrome:Provide nonjudgmental, honest, supportive care. Teach what to expect in regard to the neonate's behavior.Educate about strategies that will provide comfort to herinfant during withdrawal. Teach her how to feed her infant. Observe maternal-newborn interactions and involve themother in the care of her newborn. Neonates who have been exposed to substances during the prenat al period often exhibit behaviors that interfere with the maternal-newborn relationship,such as irritability, resistance to being comforted,arching while being held, altered sleep states, poor feeding behavior, easily agitated when stimulated, and difficult transitions from one state to another. Characteristics of mothers with a history of subst ance abuse that may impair the maternal- newborn r elationship include lack of sensitivity to infant cues, lack of emotional stability, lack of communication with the infant, and inconsistent/unavailable caregiving. Document all assessments and observations in themedical r ecord per agency pr otocol (Pitts, 2010).CONGENITAL ABNORMALITIES Congenital anomalies or birth defects occur in approximately20% of infant deaths in the United States (Sterk, 2010).Abnormalities range from being undetectable at birth tomajor and threatening.Risk factorsChromosomal abnormalities Environmental factors: Teratogens such as radiation,illicit substances, alcohol, diseases (diabetes), medications,and infections such as TORCH (T oxoplasmosis, Other infections, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes simplex virus) Multifactorial disorders: Abnormalities that result in a combination of environmental and genetic factors(Sterk, 2010) Assessment Findings See Table 17-13 for common congenital anomalies. See Table 17-14 for common cardiac anomalies. See Table 17-15 for common metabolic disorders. Nursing Actions Nursing care is determined by the type and severity ofanomaly. Genetic disease screening is obtained before discharge ofthe neonate. Provide emotional support for parents and family. Provide information on support groups. Provide information on need for follow-up care. REGIONAL CENTERS Women experiencing a high-risk pregnancy may requiretransfer to a facility that can provide the appropriate level ofcare to them and their neonate after delivery. Many facili-ties/communities lack the resources to provide care to high-risk mothers and high-risk neonates; thus, regional centerswere developed to provide services such as high-risk perinatalcare and neonatal intensive care. Transport of a high-riskneonate to a center with a neonatal intensive care unit(NICU) requires coordination between the transferring andreceiving hospitals, appropriate preparation, a highly skilledteam, and the appropriate equipment (Fig. 17-9). Key con-siderations of neonatal transport are:During the transport process, the transport team providescare that is an extension of the NICU. The aim is to pro-vide the appropriate amount of support to the neonate tomaintain stable condition. The transport process shouldminimize adverse effects of transfer on the neonate, andbe carried out in a way that protects the safety of theneonate and the transport team (Bowen, 2010). The transport team must be knowledgeable about high-risk neonatal care and assessment. Members of the teammay include a neonatal nurse practitioner, neonatologist,3704_Ch17_439-486 16/09/13 10:20 AM Page 473UNIT 5 Neonatal Period 474 resident, fellow, registered nurse, respiratory therapist,and a paramedic or emergency medical technician(Bowen, 2010). The transport process includes the following:Once the need for NICU care is identified, arrangementsare made to transfer the high-risk neonate. Information pertaining to maternal and neonatal historiesis communicated during the referral call. The appropriate team is dispatched with supplies andequipment needed to care for the neonate. The neonate is stabilized before transport. During transport the infant is kept in an incubator,thermoregulation is maintained, respiratory support and IV therapy are provided, and the following aremonitored:Vital signs, oxygen saturation, blood glucose, theneonate's condition, pain st atus, and response to transport Strategies should be used to provide developmental careduring transfer, such as protecting the neonate's eyes frombright lights, using ear protection in noisy vehicles such ashelicopters, using a gel mattress to prevent jarring, andusing blankets to promote containment. Notify parents when the infant arrives at the receivingfacility (Bowen, 2010). Various vehicles may be used for transport, such as ambu- lance, helicopter, or fixed wing aircraft. The type of vehicle thatis used will be determined by factors such as the neonate's con-dition and diagnosis, distance of transport, weather, and cost.System Signs and symptoms CommentsCENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISTURBANCESMETABOLIC, VASOMOTOR, AND RESPIRATORY DISTURBANCESGASTROINTESTINAL DISTURBANCESCrying: Excessive high-pitchedCrying: Continuous high-pitchedSleeps less than 1 hour after feedingSleeps less than 2 hours after feedingSleeps less than 3 hours after feeding23321 1Myoclonic jerks 3Generalized convulsions 5Sweating 1 Frequent yawning (greater than 1Mottling 1Nasal stuffiness 1Sneezing (greater than 3) 1Nasal flaringRespiratory than 60/min)Respiratory rate (greater than 60/min Excessive sucking 1Poor feeding 2RegurgitationProjectile vomiting23 stools2312Fever to 101\u00b0F (37.2-38.3\u00b0C)Fever greater than 101\u00b0F (38.4\u00b0C)12ScoreDate Time Abstinence 16/09/13 10:20 AM Page 474CHAPTER High-Risk Neonatal Nursing Care 475 TABLE 17-13 COMMON CONGENITAL ANOMALIES TYPE (2010).1 in 4,500 live births2-4 in 10,000 live births 1 in 1000-6000 live births 1 in 5000-6000 live births 1 in 30,000- 50,000 live births 1 in 1,000 live births1 in 2,500 live births1 in 20,000 live births 1 in 1,000 live births1 in 1,000 live births1-2 in 1,000 live births 1 in 2,200 live births1 in 1,000 live birthsAbnormal opening between the trachea and esophagus Obstruction of the nasal passagesHerniation of abdominal organs through a hole in the diaphragm intothe thoracic cavity Herniation of abdominal contents through the umbilicus which is coveredby the peritoneal sac Herniation of abdominal contents through a hole in the abdomen oftento the right of the umbilicus Failure of the mesenchymal masses of the nasal and maxillary prominences tocome together Failure of the mesenchymal masses in the palate to fuse A sac with meninges and cerebrospinal fluid bulge through defect in undevel-oped vertebrae A sac with meninges and nerve tissue bulge through a defect in the spinal column Incomplete formation of the cranium and brain Dislocation of the femoral head from the acetabulum Extra digits on the hand or footFusion of digits of hand or footSole of the foot is turned in; the back part of the foot is usually bilateral.Surgical repairSurgical repairGastric large defects (abdominal contentsreturned gradually) Surgical repairStaged surgical repair for large defects Surgical repair Surgical repairSurgical repairSurgical repairMost babies die within a few days of birth Pavlik harness to promote abduction/flexion to stabilize hip Surgery if Pavlik harness is not successful Surgery or ligationSurgery depending on extent of anomaly Casting/splintingSurgeryTreatment depends on severity.

In some cases, infantsrequire long-term evaluation to monitor health issues, growth,and neurodevelopment. Many high-risk conditions, such asprematurity and related complications, perinatal substance use, and congenital anomalies, may have long-term, even lifelong, physical, cognitive, and behavioral consequences. Thefollowing are critical components of the discharge process forhigh-risk neonates (Hummel, 2010):When a high-risk neonate is admitted, planning for dis-charge begins. Parents should be encouraged to beinvolved with the care of their infant from the time ofadmission. Care-related teaching with parents shouldbegin as soon after delivery as possible. Interdisciplinary teams are often involved in the dischargeprocess. The team may consist of physicians, nurse practi-tioners, nurses, social workers, occupational therapist, casemanager, lactation consultant, respiratory therapist, nutri-tionist, pharmacist, and home health agency/nursing staff. Readiness for discharge is assessed.The neonate's condition must be stable (e.g., weight gain,temperature stability, able to tolerate feedings, stable respi-ratory status; Fig. 17-10).All appropriate examinations and screenings are completed,such as an eye exam, genetic disease/metabolic diseasescreening, and a hearing screening. The neonate must be able to pass a car seat trial for a specified amount of time. Secured snugly in an appropriate size car seat at a 45-degree angle Maint ains adequate oxygenation, heart rate, and respir atory rate during trial Family's readiness to take their infant home is assessed. The family's willingness and ability to provide care totheir infant with special needs is e valuated, as are their financial resources. In addition, the home setting isassessed for safety and adequacy. The educational needs of the family are met. Dischargeteaching includes: General infant care, such as bathing, feeding schedule,diapering, skin care Saf ety issues, such as car seat safety, positioning the infant on the back to sleep , inf ant CPR, baby proofing the house Instructions on use of required equipment (e.g., apneamonitoring)TABLE 17-15 COMMON GENETIC DISORDERS OF METABOLISM\u2014cont'd TYPE OF DISORDER INCIDENCE DESCRIPTION TREATMENT GALACTOSEMIA Strek (2010).1 in 40,000-60,000 live birthsLack of enzyme galactose to glucose.

Encourage the woman to pump her breast and bring themilk to the NICU to be used for feeding.Review breast milk storage and provide equipment as needed. Provide a private area for the woman to breastfeed whenthe neonate is able to nurse. Encourage parents to take photos to share with theirfamily and friends. Praise parents for their involvement in the neonate's care. Provide information on support groups for parents ofpreterm infants or infants with disabilities. LOSS AND GRIEF When a baby dies, parents must work through profound griefassociated with the loss of their child, and the loss of theirhopes and dreams for that child and their family. Grief is aprocess that is individual in nature. Often members of thefamily experience grief in different ways and in varied timelines. The stages of grief include:Avoidance, disbelief, shock Pain, physical discomforts, depression, difficulty concen-trating, anger at self or partner, guilt Acceptance and adaptation. Grief persists, but a sense ofbalance is achieved (Kenner, 2010).It is important that nurses keep in mind that each person experiences and expresses grief in his or her own way.Culture, religion, and personal experience and beliefs willimpact how individuals and families respond to loss. Nursescan help families that are grieving the death of their baby bycarrying out various interventions including:Allow parents to express their feelings by being presentand listening. Express empathy and condolences. Avoid clich\u00e9s such as,\"at least you are young; you can have another baby.\" Refer to the baby by name, if the baby has been named. Provide information about the process of grieving andwhat to expect physically and emotionally. Provide ample opportunity for the parents and familymembers to spend time with the baby before and after heor she dies. Provide parents with memorabilia associated with theirbaby, such as pictures, blankets, a cap, a lock of hair, IDbracelet, footprints, and crib card. Offer to contact the hospital chaplain. Encourage thefamily to contact their own clergy. Explore the family'sdesire for baptism or other religious rites. Discuss the family's plan for autopsy, a memorial orfuneral, burial/cremation. Encourage the family to accept help and support fromothers. Refer parents to community services and supportgroups that may assist in facilitating the grief process(Kenner, 2010).Information on treatments (e.g., oxygen, suctioning)and medications ordered Signs and symptoms of illnesses that need to be r eport- ed to the primar y car e provider Infant growth and developmental milestones Follow-up information including visits with the pediatri-cian, immunization schedules, and r ef errals to the appropriate medical and developmental specialists PSYCHOSOCIAL NEEDS OF PARENTS WITH HIGH-RISK NEONATES The birth of a baby who is premature or who has conditionsthat place him or her at risk for illness or even death is a significant stressor for the family. Parents may grieve over theloss of an ideal baby and find the experience of having a babywith complications overwhelming. It is devastating for mostparents when the woman is discharged and their baby mustremain in the hospital. Common effects on the parents and family are: Delay of attachment process due to the separation of parent and newborn, which can place the newborn at riskfor abuse and neglect Guilt feelings by the woman, who may feel she did some-thing wrong to cause her newborn to be ill Emotional distancing of parents from their newborn as a protective mechanism due to fear of losing theirchild Anger at the loss of control of having an ill or prematurenewborn Disappointment at not being able to bring their newborn home Disruption of family life; parents needing to return to work, caring for other child, and at the same timewanting to spend time in the hospital with theirneonate Nursing Actions Orient parents to the NICU environment by explainingequipment/monitors used for their neonate. Assess parents' comfort level with the NICU environment. Provide opportunities for parents to share their concernsand frustrations by developing a trusting rapport with theparents and through active listening skills. Provide opportunities for parents to talk about theirexperiences by asking parents how they are coping withthe experience and by use of active listening. Provide information regarding their neonate's status toboth parents at a level they can understand. Inform parents that they should ask any question theyhave regarding the condition and care of their neonate. Inform parents that they can talk to their neonate's nurseat any time. Assess the parents' readiness to care for their neonate andprovide opportunities for them to participate in the careof their neonate.3704_Ch17_439-486 16/09/13 10:20 AM Page 478CHAPTER 17 High-Risk Neonatal Nursing Care 479 Clinical Pathway for the Preterm Infant Birth to First Hour 1-24 Hours of Age 24 Hours of Age to Discharge Assessments Thermoregulation RespiratoryReview prenatal record to deter- mine projected gestational age.

Nursing Actions 1.Administer parenteral nutrition, enteral feedings, or oral feedings as per orders. 2.Encourage use of breast milk. 3.Monitor weight daily. 4.Monitor length and head circumference weekly. 5.Instill breast milk or formula, when gavage feeding, over 20 minutes at a rate of 1 mL/min. 6.Monitor the neonate during feedings for signs of feeding intolerance, such as vomiting, regurgitation, and excessivegastric residual. 7.Encourage breastfeeding when indicated. 8.Monitor intake and output. Problem No. 6: Impaired parent-infant attachment Goal: Positive parent-infant attachment Outcome: Parents hold the infant close to the body and the infant appears calm and relaxed; parents spend time each daywith the infant and participate in care of the infant; parentsrespond to infant cues.Nursing Actions 1.Orient parents to the NICU environment. 2.Provide opportunities for parents to share their concerns and frustrations. 3.Provide opportunities for parents to talk about their expe- riences of having a high-risk neonate. 4.Assess parents' readiness to care for their neonate and provide opportunities for participation in caring for their neonate. 5.Instruct parents on neonatal care. 6.Praise parents for their involvement. 7.Encourage the woman to pump her breast and bring her breast milk for use with infant feeding. 8.Encourage kangaroo holding by both parents. TYING IT ALL TOGETHER Baby girl Polk is a newly delivered 32 weeks' gestation neonatewho is admitted to the NICU. Her mother, Mallory, is a 42-year-old African American single woman. Mallory is a G2 P0 who conceived after three attempts at in vitro fertilization.Mallory was admitted to the birthing unit for preterm labor.She was given magnesium sulfate, ampicillin, and two doses ofbetamethasone. Her labor contraction continued. When hercervix was 5 cm dilated, a decision was made to discontinue the magnesium sulfate. A few hours after the magnesium sulfate was discontinued, Mallory gave birth spontaneously toa baby girl. The 1- and 5-minute Apgar scores were 7 and 8,respectively. Baby Polk weighed 2,010 grams and was assessedat 32 weeks based on Ballard score.Detail the aspects of your initial nursing assessment.List the nursing diagnosis for this neonate.What are the immediate priorities in the nursing care of Baby Polk?Discuss the rationale for the selected priorities.List the anticipated medical care for Baby Polk. 4 hours later:Baby Polk is on NCPAP. There is an increase in intercostal retractions and expiratory grunting. The results of arterialblood gas (ABG) tests are Pco 2of 70 and pH of 7.2. CBC indi- cates an increase in WBC. Medical orders include initial dose of Survanta, IV of D10, glucose monitoring every 4 hours, ampicillin 50 mg/kg, andgentamicin 4 mg/kg.Based on this additional information ,list the nursing diagnosis for this neonate. List the anticipated medical care.Discuss the nursing care for this neonate and mother. 1 week later:Baby Polk is extubated and is placed on high-flow nasal cannula at 1 liter. She is tolerating gavage feedings and gaining weight. Sheis experiencing occasional episodes of apnea and bradycardia.Discuss the criteria for discharge from the NICU. Describe the discharge teaching for the care of baby Polk.3704_Ch17_439-486 16/09/13 10:20 AM Page 482CHAPTER 17 High-Risk Neonatal Nursing Care 483 Review Questions 1.A nurse is assessing a preterm baby with a gestational ageof 32 weeks and birth weight of 1,389 grams.

HEALTH PROMOTION Health promotion is a critical component of women's health(Fig. 18-1). Health promotion is defined by the World Health Organization as \"the process of enabling people toincrease control over, and to improve, their health\" (WHO,2010). Based on this definition, the focus on nursing care isdirected at providing women with information and resourcesthat enable them to increase control over and to improve theirhealth (see Critical Component: Heart Attack and StrokeWarning Signs and Critical Component: HPV Vaccine).Risk Reduction The leading causes of death in females in the United States are:Heart disease\u201424.5% Cancer\u201421.7%Top three cancers are breast, Don't have time to read this chapter?

Health promotion and risk reductioncan prevent or decrease the risk for many of these causes.Influenza and pneumonia\u20142.5% Kidney disease\u20142% Septicemia\u20141.6% (CDC, 2012a) Figure 18-1 Health promotion for all women of all ages is a critical component for women's health.CRITICAL COMPONENT Heart Attack and Stroke Warning Signs Heart Attack: Uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain in thecenter of the chest Pain or discomfort in one or both arms, back, neck, jaw,and/or stomach Shortness of breath with or without chest discomfort Nausea Lightheadedness Sweating Stroke: Sudden onset of numbness or weakness in the face, arm,and/or leg, especially on one side Sudden onset of trouble seeing out of one or both eyes Sudden onset of trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balanceor coordination Severe headache with no known cause (A Lifetime of Good Health, HHS, 2012) TABLE 18-1 TOP 3 LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH IN FEMALES BY AGE GROUP AND RACE AMERICAN INDIAN/ ASIA OR PACIFIC ALASKA NATIVE ISLANDER BLACK HISPANIC WHITE 20-24 diseaseCancerHeart diseaseUnintentional injuries 3704_Ch18_487-502 03/10/13 2:52 PM Page 488CHAPTER 18 Well Women's Health 489 Actions for Reducing Risks Follow guidelines for routine screenings and immu-nizations (Table 18-2). Eat a healthy diet.A healthy diet is one that is rich in vegetables, fruits,whole grains, fiber, fat-free or low-fat dairy, and fish;and low in foods that are high in saturated fat and sodium (Fig. 18-2) The women's diet needs to include 3 cups of low-fat or fat-free milk or low-fat yogurt and/or low-fat cheese Women who cannot get enough calcium in their dietsshould tak e a calcium supplement. This will help decrease the risk of and/or degree of osteoporosis. Be physically active (see Critical Component: PhysicalActivity).It is recommended that women of all ages engage daily in30 minutes of moderate physical activity such as walkingbriskly, swimming, bicycling, or dancing. Physical activity/weight-bearing exercise improves bonehealth by slowing bone loss, improving muscle strength,and improving balance (HHS, 2012). Women should consult with their health care providerbefore starting a new exercise program.TABLE 18-1 TOP 3 LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH IN FEMALES BY AGE GROUP AND RACE\u2014cont'd AMERICAN INDIAN/ ASIA OR PACIFIC ALASKA NATIVE ISLANDER BLACK HISPANIC WHITE CancerHeart diseaseChronic lower respiratory diseases Heart diseaseCancerChronic lower respiratory diseases Heart diseaseCancerAlzheimer's disease CRITICAL COMPONENT Physical Activity Physical activity can lower the woman's risk for: Heart disease Type 2 diabetes Colon cancer Breast cancer Falls Depression (HHS, 2012)CRITICAL COMPONENT HPV Vaccine Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexuallytransmitted virus in the United States. HPV is the main cause of cervical cancer. Gardasil and Cervarix are vaccines given to prevent mostcases of cervical cancer. Gardasil protects against HPV types 6 and 11, which areassociated with genital warts and low-grade cervical lesions.It also protects against HPV types 16 and 18, which are associated with cervical cancer. Cervarix only protects against types 16 and 18. Gardasil is recommended for girls and boys 11 or 12 years of age. Cervarix is recommended for girls and women 13 through 26 years of age. Both vaccines are given in three doses: second dose given 1-2 months after rst dose; third dose given 6 months afterrst dose. It is most effective when given before the woman becomessexually active.

Obesity places the woman at risk for a variety of healthcare problems (see Critical Component: Obesity). Avoid cigarette smoking and secondhand smoke.Tobacco use is a leading cause of heart disease and cancer. More women die from lung cancer than any other type ofcancer (CDC, 2012d). The rate of death is 39 per 100,000 women (CDC,2012d). Limit alcohol consumption.Those who choose to drink alcohol should do so in modera-tion, which is one drink per day for women. Drinking during pregnancy increases the woman's risk ofhaving a baby with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder(CDC, 2012e). Excessive drinking increases the woman's risk for infertili-ty, miscarriages, stillbirth, and preterm birth (CDC,2012e). Excessive drinking increases a woman's risk for alcoholism, elevated blood pressure, obesity, diabetes,stroke, breast cancer, suicide, and accidents (CDC,2012e).Binge drinking increases the risk for sexual assault, espe-cially for women in college settings (CDC, 2012e). Prevent injury from accidents.Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death frominjury among younger women. Risk reduction: Wear seat belts, follow speed limits,and do not drink alcohol prior to driving. Injury related falls are the leading cause of injury, death,and disability for women 65 years old or older. Risk reduction: Exercise to improve strength and bal-ance, home modification to r educe fall hazards, and medication assessment to minimize side effects such asdizziness (Stevens & Olson, 2000). Prevent sexually transmitted illnesses.Use condoms correctly and for all sexual contact. Be in a monogamous relationship\u2014both the woman and her partner have sex only with each other and noone else. Both the woman and her partner are screened for STIs,including HIV, prior to engaging in sexual activities. Figure 18-2 MyPlate is a tool that can be used when discussing nutrition with a client. Source: United States Department of Agriculture, http://ChooseMyPlate.gov CRITICAL COMPONENT Obesity Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher.Obesity places a woman at higher risk for: Coronary heart disease Type 2 diabetes Cancer: endometrial, cervical, and breast Low back pain Knee osteoarthritis Abnormal menstrual cycle and subinfertility High risk pregnancies: diabetes and hypertension Neonatal mortality and malformations Decreased intention to breastfeed, decreased initiation ofbreastfeeding and decreased duration of breastfeeding (Kulie et al., 2011) Routine Screenings Throughout the woman's lifetime there are screening teststhat can assist the woman's health care provider in identifyingpotential alterations in health and in initiating early interven-tions (see Critical Component: Screening Mammograms).Recommended screenings and immunizations for women arepresented in Table 18-2.Breast cancer screeningIt is important that women know how their breasts nor-mally look and feel and do monthly breast self-exams.

Women over 65 years of age can stop cervical cancerscreening as long as they have not had any serious pre-cancers found in the previous 20 years (American CancerSociety, 2012a). Healthy People 2020 objectives: Increase the proportion of women who receive cervical cancer scr eening based on the most current guideline from 84.5% to 93% of females ages 21-65 years. Increase the proportion of women counseled by their pr ovider about Pap t ests from 59.8% to 65.8% of females ages 21-65 years (Healthy People 2012). CRITICAL COMPONENT Papanicolaou (Pap) Smear Pap test is a microscopic examination of cells taken from thecervix. It is primarily used for early detection of cancerous or precancerous cells. It is a screening test. An abnormal result needs to be followed up with further testing. The best time to get a Pap test is 5 days after the menstrualperiod has stopped. The woman should not douche; use tampons; use vaginalcreams, spermicide foams, creams, or jellies; use vaginallubricants or moisturizers; or use vaginal medications for 48 hours prior to test. The woman should not have sexual intercourse for 48 hoursprior to the test. A speculum is inserted in the vagina. Both cervical and vagi-nal specimens are obtained. A synthetic ber brush or plasticspatula is used to obtain the specimens. (American Cancer Society, 2012b).CRITICAL COMPONENT When abnormities are identied on a screening mammogram,further testing is needed, which may include a diagnosticmammogram, ultrasound, MRI, or biopsy. Women with breast implants need to inform the mammogramfacility that they have breast implants. Implants can hide someof the breast tissue. Women should not wear any deodorants, perfume, lotion, orpowder under their arms or on their breasts on the day of theappointment. These substances can make shadows on the x-ray.Screening Mammograms Mammogram is a low-dose x-ray of the breast looking forabnormal changes. A specially designed x-ray machine is used. Each breast (one at a time) is placed between the x-ray plateand plastic plate. Pressure is gradually placed on the breast toflatten the breast. A clearer picture of the breast is obtained byflattening the breast. Women may experience a sense of the breast being squeezedor pinched. The radiologist will compare the present x-ray with previous breastx-rays, looking for changes, lumps/masses, and calcication. (HHS, Ofce of Women's Health, 2009) REPRODUCTIVE CHANGES ACROSS THE LIFE SPAN Throughout a woman's lifetime her body undergoes physicalchanges related to hormonal changes. Major reproductivechanges occur during puberty and during the time before andafter menopause. Puberty Puberty is the period of time when a person becomes sexuallymature and capable of reproduction.Onset of puberty in girls usually occurs between the agesof 8 and 13 years. It is accompanied with accelerated growth of the bodythat usually begins with the feet and ends with the face. It is triggered by the production of gonadotropin-releasinghormone from the hypothalamus, which stimulates theanterior pituitary to release ovaries to secrete estrogen (Fig. 18-4). Estrogen is responsible for the development of secondarysex characteristics in females. These characteristics include:Enlargement of breasts\u2014growth of the duct system of themammary glands and erection of nipples Growth of body hair\u2014axillary and pubic hair Widening of the hips Menarche, the initial menstrual period, usually occurs 2-2.5 years after the beginning of puberty. Puberty is completed when menstruation assumes a regu-lar pattern. Menstrual cycle\u2014see Chapter 3. Menopause Menopause is the stage of life that marks the permanent cessation of menstrual activity.It usually occurs between ages 35-58. It is a natural biological process.3704_Ch18_487-502 03/10/13 2:52 PM Page 493UNIT 6 Women's Health 494 Menopause is divided into three stages:Perimenopause: Begins when the woman experiences menopausal signs and symptoms and ends after the firstyear following the last menstrual period. This stage canlast several years as the woman experiences irregular men-strual cycles. It is possible for a woman to become pregnantduring this stage. Menopause: Occurs 12 months after a woman's last menstrual period. Average age in United States is age 51. Postmenopause: Refers to the time after menopause. As a woman enters her late 30s, her ovaries begin to stop producing eggs and there is a decline in the production ofestrogen and progesterone. The woman will begin to experi-ence changes in her body related to the decreasing levels ofestrogen. These changes are often referred to as signs andsymptoms of menopause. Signs and Symptoms of Menopause Irregular periodsMenstrual cycle may become irregular. The time between cycles may become longer or shorter. Menstrual flow may become heavier or lighter. Cycles become anovulatory, and the woman becomesinfertile. Hot flashesHot flashes are the most common symptom of menopause. They are caused by a vasomotor response to changes inthe hormonal levels. This change triggers blood vesselsnear the surface of the skin to dilate, causing an increaseof blood supply, which causes an increase in heat to theskin surface. When a woman experiences a hot flash, she feels a sud-den sensation of warmth that spreads through her upperbody and face. The woman's neck and face become red,and she begins to sweat and may feel irritable andexhausted. Night sweatsNight sweats are hot flashes that occur while the woman issleeping. Women who experience night sweats will wake up withtheir bed linens and nightwear soaked from sweat. Sleep disturbancesWomen may experience altered sleep patterns related tonight sweats and difficulty falling asleep and stayingasleep. Vaginal drynessNormal vaginal mucosa and secretions are dependent onestrogen. As estrogen decreases, the vaginal tissue becomesthinner and drier. Vaginal dryness can lead to discomfort during intercourse. Mood changes and trouble focusingThese may be related more to sleep disturbances thandirectly to decreased estrogen. Women may also experience:Decreased interest in sex Fatigue Hair loss Incontinence Irregular heartbeat/palpitations Treating Menopausal Symptoms There are three approaches for the treatment of menopausalsymptoms: lifestyle changes, alternative medicine, andmenopause hormone therapy (MHT).Lifestyle changesGet 8 hours of sleep per night. Eat a balanced diet. Exercise. Avoid caffeine and alcohol. Avoid cigarette smoking and secondhand smoke. Alternative medicineHerbal supplements such as black cohosh Acupuncture Biofeedback Hypnosis Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT).There are conflicting research findings on the safety ofMHT. Women need to talk with their health careproviders as to the benefit and risk of MHT. Estrogen alone is prescribed for women who do not have auterus. Estrogen and progesterone therapy is prescribed forwomen who have a uterus. The use of progesterone with estrogen therapy reduces the risk of endometrialcancer.Hypothalam us Anterior pituitary Gonadotropin Ovaries Estrogen Secondary sex characteristicsGonadotropin-releasing Figure 18-4 Hormonal triggers.3704_Ch18_487-502 03/10/13 2:52 PM Page 494CHAPTER 18 Well Women's Health 495 A T score is determined by comparing the woman's bonedensity to that of the average peak density of the same sexand race. A T score of -2.5 or below is indicative of osteoporosis. A T score of -1 to -2.5 is indicative of osteopenia, bone density between normal and osteoporosis. Signs and Symptoms Back pain related to a fracture or collapsed vertebra Loss of height related to collapsed vertebra Stooped posture related to collapsed vertebra Bone fractures related to bone weakness Risk Factors for Osteoporosis Caucasian women Thin, small-boned women Family history of osteoporosis History of smoking Inactivity Low levels of calcium and vitamin DVitamin D helps with the absorption of dietary calcium. Excessive alcohol consumption Decreased levels of estrogen Long-term use of steroids Eating disorders such as anorexia Weight loss surgery Risk Reduction Maintain a diet high in calcium and vitamin D (seeCritical Component: Foods High in Calcium). Thisshould start around 9 years of age to help form a strongbone matrix and should continue throughout thewoman's life based on these guidelines:1,300 mg of calcium for girls 9-18 years of age 1,000 mg of calcium/day for women 19-50 years of age(premenopausal) 1,200 mg of calcium for women 51 years of age and older(menopausal) 600 IU of vitamin D/day for girls and women 9-70 800 mg/day for women older than 70 years of age(ACOG, 2012a). Engage in weight-bearing exercise.Walking, jogging, dancing, and weightlifting three to fourtimes/weekTreatment for Specific Menopausal Discomforts Hot flashes: Avoid alcohol, hot beverages, spicy foods,warm rooms, and smoking; these can trigger hot flashes.Dress in layers, so that the woman is able to removeclothing as she becomes warm and add clothing as shecools down. Avoid wearing clothing made out of wool orsynthetics. Use of fans is also helpful.Medications used to treat other conditions that have beenshown to decrease hot flashes Night sweats: Sleep in cotton nightwear. Use cotton bedlinens. Sleep in cool room. Sleep with fan blowing overbody. Take a cool shower before bedtime. Sleep disturbances: Keep the bedroom dark, quiet, andcool. Establish a regular bedtime pattern. Vaginal dryness: Use water-based lubricants during sexualintercourse. Use vaginal moisturizers. Use estrogen vagi-nal cream. Soy flour and flaxseeds in the woman's dietmay prevent or decrease the degree of vaginal dryness. OSTEOPOROSIS Osteoporosis is the loss of bone mass that occurs when more bone mass is absorbed than new body mass is laid down. Theloss of bone mass usually occurs after the age of 35 at a rate of0.3%-0.5%. Women who experience osteoporosis are atgreater risk for vertebral and hip fractures. Osteoporosisaffects both men and women, but 80% of all Americans diag-nosed with osteoporosis are women.Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan (DXA)It is a diagnosis test for osteoporosis. The DXA measures the bone density in the hip, the spine,and the forearm.POSITION STATEMENT: HORMONE THERAPY \"Hormone therapy is the most effective treatment formenopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness.If women have only vaginal dryness or discomfort with inter-course, the preferred treatments are low doses of vaginal estro-gen. Hot flashes generally require a higher dose of hormonetherapy that will have an effect on the entire body. Women who still have a uterus need to take a progestogen (progesterone or a similar product) along with the estrogen toprevent cancer of the uterus. Five years or less is usually the rec-ommended duration of use for this combined treatment, butthe length of time can be individualized for each woman. Women who have had their uterus removed can take estro- gen alone. Because of the apparent greater safety of estrogenalone, there may be more flexibility in how long women cansafely use estrogen therapy.\" The North American Menopause Society, American Society of ReproductiveMedicine, and The Endocrine Society (2012).

Evidence-Based Practice: Effect of StrengthTraining on Bone Loss Winters-Stone, K., Dobek, J., Nail, L., Bennett, J., Michael, L., Naik, A., &Schwartz, A. (2011). Strength training stops bone loss and builds muscle in post-menopausal breast cancer survivors: a randomized, controlled trail. Breast Cancer Research and Treatment, 127, 447-456. The hypothesis of this randomized, control research studywas that progressive, moderately intense resistance plusimpact training would increase or maintain hip and spinebone mass, lean mass and fat mass, and reduce boneturnover compared to a control group who participated in alow-intensity, non-weight-bearing stretching program. Thestudy included 106 women with early stage breast cancerwho were greater than 1 year post radiation and/orchemotherapy; 50 years of age or greater at time of diagno-sis; and free from osteoporosis and medications for boneloss. Each group participated in a 12-month program. Theintervention group's program consisted of moderately-intense resistance exercises and impact training. The controlgroup's program consisted of whole body stretching andrelaxation exercises done in a seating or lying position. The results of the study were that the women in the moderately-intense resistance plus impact training programpreserved bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine toa greater degree than the women in the control group andhad lower bone turnover than the control group. Implications: Moderately-intense resistance plus impact training program can reduce risk for fracture among post-menopausal breast cancer survivors (BCS). Pharmacotherapy The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists(2012) recommends osteoporosis pharmacotherapy for thefollowing women:Women who have experienced a fragility or low-impactfracture Women with a DXA T score of less than or equal to -2.5 Women with risk factors and with a DXA T score of lessthan -1.5 (ACOG, 2012a)The fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX) can be used todetermine a 10-year risk for fractures related to osteoporo-sis. The tool is located at www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/tool.jsp. Pharmacotherapy includes:Bisphosphonates (see Critical Component:Bisphosphonates)Action: Inhibits resorption of bone Resorption is the process wher e breakdown of bone and release of minerals occurs with the resultingtransfer of calcium from the bone fluid to the blood.CRITICAL COMPONENT Bisphosphonates To reduce side effects and to enhance absorption of the oralmedication, the woman should: Take the medication in the morning on an empty stomach atleast 30 minutes before breakfast. Take the medication with at least 8 oz. of water (do not takewith juice, coffee, or tea). Take the medication in a sitting or standing position. This will decrease the risk of the pill becoming lodged inthe esophagus where it can cause ulcerations and scarring. Remain upright for at least 30 minutes. This will decrease the risk of reflux of the pill into theesophagus.

Cognitive: The adolescent moves from being a concretethinker to being able to think abstractly, use logic to solveproblems, use deductive reasoning, and plan for the future.Adolescents begin to be concerned with moral and socialissues and compare their beliefs with those of their peers. Psychosocial: The adolescent is working toward role iden-tity; who they are and who they will be in life. As theywork toward role identity they develop a set of personalmoral and ethical values and a greater sense of self-esteemand self-worth as well as a satisfactory sexual identity.The majority of adolescents are physically healthy but are at risk for major health problems. Health problems and issuesfor female adolescents include:Unintentional injuries, suicide, and homicides\u2014these arethe leading causes of death for females ages 15-19. Eating disorders\u2014obesity, anorexia, and bulimia Sexually transmitted illnesses\u2014chlamydia and gonorrheaare prevalent in adolescents. Teen pregnancies\u2014in 2011, there were 329,797 babiesborn to women ages 15-19 years (CDC, 2012f) Issues related to self-esteem\u201422.1% of female adoles-cents report being electronically bullied, and 22% reportbeing bullied on school property (CDC, 2010g). Menstrual disorders AcneBased on the 2011 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), risk factors for health problems for female adoles-cents are (CDC, 2012g):Behaviors that contribute to unintentional injury orviolence85.95% rarely or never wear a bicycle helmet while ridinga bike. 24.9% rode in a car driven by someone who had beendrinking. 30.4% have texted or e-mailed while driving a car. 24.4% have been in a physical fight. 19.3% have seriously considered attempting suicide. 9.8% have attempted suicide. Alcohol, tobacco, and drug use16.1% smoke cigarettes. 19.8% have had five or more drinks of alcohol in a row(binge drinking). 37.2% have used marijuana. 19.8% have taken prescription drugs, such as Oxycontin,without a doctor's prescription.Unhealthy sex 12.6% have had four or more sexualpartners. 15.1% did not use any methods to prevent pregnancyduring the last sexual intercourse. 18.1% have drunk alcohol or used drugs before the last sexual intercourse. Unhealthy dietary behaviors9.8% are obese and 15.4 are overweight. 17.4% have not eaten for 24 hours to lose weight or to keepweight off. 6% have vomited or taken laxatives to lose weight or tokeep from gaining weight. Inadequate physical activity17.7% do not participate in at least 60 minutes of physicalactivity per day. 26.6% use computers for 3 or more hours per day. 31.6% watch television for 3 or more hours per day. Health promotion through information is an important ele- ment in assisting youth in decreasing unhealthy behaviors.Nurses working in the middle school and high school settingsare in ideal positions for promoting healthy behaviors in adoles-cents. School nurses are often viewed by youth as safe adults toturn to when they have issues regarding health or body changesor when they are in need of sexual information. School nurseshave the opportunity to provide health information and riskreduction information to large groups of adolescents and canpresent this information based on the needs of their school'spopulation. School nurses can also advocate for the availabilityof health resources for youth in their school district. A Healthy People 2020 goal is to increase the proportion of adolescents who annually have a wellness check-up from68.7% to 75.6%. Wellness checkups are an ideal time to assessfor risky behaviors and potential health problems and to pro-vide health promotion information. LESBIAN HEALTH Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individualsexperience health disparities related to societal stigma, dis-crimination, and denial of civil rights (Healthy People, 2012).Healthy People 2010's report identified the need for moreresearch to document, understand, and address the factors thatcontribute to the health disparities in the LGBT communities(Healthy People, 2012). A result of this report, HealthyPeople 2020 has set a goal to improve the health, safety, andwell-being of LGBT individuals (Healthy People, 2012). Lesbians face barriers to quality health care. Three of these barriers are lack of health insurance, fear of negative reactionfrom health care provider due to sexual orientation, and lackof understanding by health care providers of lesbian healthcare issues. Health issues for lesbians include:Cancer: Lesbians are at higher risk for breast, cervical,endometrial, and ovarian cancer due to lesbians havinghigher rates of smoking, alcohol use, and obesity than3704_Ch18_487-502 03/10/13 2:52 PM Page 497UNIT 6 Women's Health 498 heterosexual women. Lesbians are also less likely to fol-low the recommended frequency of screening tests suchas Pap test and mammograms (Gay and Lesbian MedicalAssociation [GLMA], 2010). Obesity: Lesbians have a higher body mass than hetero-sexual women (GLMA, 2010). This increases their riskfor heart disease and cancer. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS): PCOS is a com-mon hormonal reproductive problem of all women. Itappears more frequently in lesbians and increases women'srisk for menstrual disorders, infertility, abnormal insulinproduction, and heart disease. Heart disease: Lesbians are at higher risk for heart diseasedue to higher rates of smoking and obesity. Tobacco, alcohol, and substance use: Use of these sub-stances is higher in lesbians compared to heterosexualwomen. Domestic violence: Domestic violence occurs in lesbian rela-tionships, but at a lower rate than for heterosexual women.All women need to be screened for domestic violence.ACOG COMMITTEE OPINION Health Care for Lesbians and Bisexual Women\"Lesbians and bisexual women encounter barriers to healthcare that include concerns about conf identiality and disclo- sure, discriminatory attitudes and treatment, limited access tohealth care and health insurance, and often a limited under-standing as to what their health care risks may be. Health careproviders should offer quality care to all women regardless ofsexual orientation. The American College of Obstetricians andGynecologists endorse equitable treatment for lesbians andbisexual women and their families, not only for direct healthcare needs, but also for indirect health care issues.\" ACOG, (2012).Depression and anxiety: Lesbians report a higher rate ofdepression and anxiety than heterosexual women, whichmay be related to feelings of discrimination based on sex-ual orientation (HHS, 2005).3704_Ch18_487-502 03/10/13 2:52 PM Page 498CHAPTER 18 Well Women's Health 499 Problem No. 1: Knowledge deficit related to diet and bone health Goal: Increased knowledge of the relationship of diet and bone health Outcome: The woman's diet will include foods high in calci- um and foods high in vitamin D.

COMMON DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES Table 19-1 provides an overview of the common diagnostic procedures used in women's health care. HYSTERECTOMY Hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus, is the sec- ond most frequently performed surgery for women in theUnited States (CDC, 2008). Cesarean section is the mostcommon performed surgery.Reasons for Hysterectomy The top three reasons for hysterectomy are:Leiomyomas\u2014benign fibrous tumor of the uterine wall Endometriosis\u2014abnormal growth of tissue resembling theendometrium that is present outside of the uterine cavity Uterine prolapse Other reasons include:Cancer\u2014cervical, ovarian, endometrial Abnormal uterine bleeding Chronic pelvic pain Pelvic inflammatory disease3704_Ch19_503-538 16/09/13 10:21 AM Page 503UNIT 6 Women's Health 504 TABLE 19-1 COMMON DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES TEST INDICATION PROCEDURE Bone mineral densitometry (BMD) Breast biopsy LaparoscopyDiagnose bone loss and osteoporosis.Assess effectiveness of osteoporosis medication therapy. Predict risk of future bone fractures.Breast abnormality noted by palpa- tion, mammography, or ultrasound. Diagnostic: To distinguish between benign and malignant tumors Abnormal Pap smearDiagnostic: To detect cervical cancerTherapeutic: Treatment of cervical intraepithelial lesions Dysplasia, condylomas, and abnormal Pap smear Diagnostic: To rule out cancer of the cervix Diagnostic: To detect uterine malig- nancy, to evaluate fertility, and toevaluate dysfunctional uterinebleeding Therapeutic: Treat heavy uterine bleed- ing, dysmenorrhea, and incompleteabortion Diagnostic: To determine cause of dysfunctional uterine bleeding andbleeding after menopause Diagnostic: Pelvic adhesions, infertility related to tubal or uterine causes,ectopic pregnancy, ovarian tumors orcysts, pelvic inflammatory disease,and endometriosis Therapeutic: Tubal ligation, retrieval of ova for in vitro fertilization, removalof IUD, removal of adhesionsDual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA): Two x-rays of dif- ferent energy levels are used to measure BMD. The DXAmachine (a specially designed x-ray machine) is used. X-ray isusually of the lower spine and hip. Women should not wearmetal in area being x-rayed. Excisional Biopsy: The removal of the entire lump or suspi- cious area. This is done for lumps smaller than an inch indiameter. Tissue is examined by a pathologist to determine ifcancerous cells are present. Procedure may be done usinglocal or regional anesthesia. Incisional Biopsy: The removal of a portion of the tumor. Usually done with tumors larger than 1 inch in diameter.Tissue is examined by a pathologist. Procedure may be doneusing local or regional anesthesia. Fine-Needle Biopsy: A fine needle is inserted into the ques- tionable tissue. Fluid is removed from the cyst or cells areremoved from the solid mass. The fluid or cells are examinedby the pathologist. Usually done as an office procedure usinglocal anesthesia. Core Needle Biopsy: This procedure uses a larger-bore needle to obtain a small cylinder of tissue. Usually done as an officeprocedure using local anesthesia. A cone-shaped portion of cervical tissue is removed.The tissue sample is removed by scalpel, CO 2laser, or loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). Tissue is examined by a pathologist.The vagina and cervix are exposed with the use of a speculum. Acetic acid is placed on the cervix. A colposcope, an electricmicroscope with a light, is used to view the cervical area.Abnormal cervical changes are seen as white areas. A biopsy istaken from the whitest area and is evaluated by a pathologist. Can be done in the doctor's office, outpatient clinic, or hospital.Metal dilators of increasing sizes are inserted into the cervical os. After the cervix is dilated, curettes are used to scrapeand/or remove endometrial tissue. Tissue is evaluated by apathologist. A sample of the endometrium is obtained with the use of a Pipelle aspirator, a small hollow plastic tube, which is insert-ed into the uterus via the cervix. Gentle suction is applied toobtain a sample of the endometrial tissue. The sample isevaluated by a pathologist. Gynecologic laparoscopy is used to visualize the internal pelvic contents. A needle is inserted through a small incision into the peri- toneal cavity, and the cavity is filled with CO 2to enhance visualization of the organs. A laparoscope is inserted througha second incision. The laparoscope has a microscope to allowvisualization, and it can be used to insert instrumentsrequired for procedures.3704_Ch19_503-538 16/09/13 10:22 AM Page 504CHAPTER 19 Alterations in Women's Health 505 TABLE 19-1 COMMON DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES\u2014cont'd TEST INDICATION PROCEDURE Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Ultrasonography ACOG, 2010; VanLeeuwen, Kranpitz, & Smith, 2006; Women's Health, 2010bUse: To detect tumors of the breast, ovaries, and uterus; evaluate breastimplants Breast: Used to distinguish between solid tumors and cysts; detect verysmall tumors in combination withmammograms; guide interventionalprocedures such as cyst aspiration Pelvis: Used to detect tumors, cysts, abscesses, bleeding; distinguishbetween solid tumors and cysts; aidin fertility studiesMRI is a noninvasive diagnostic scanning technique using magnetic and radio waves to produce an image. The womanlies supine on a table that is slid into the MRI scanner. Shemust remain motionless during the scan. High-frequency waves of different intensity are delivered by a transducer. Waves are bounced back and converted to elec-trical energy, which is displayed on a monitor. Breast: The woman should not apply lotion, bath powder, or other substances to the chest or breast the day of the exami-nation. Jewelry and other metal objects must be removedfrom area of examination. Both breasts are usually examined. Pelvis: Can be either transabdominal or transvaginal. Transabdominal requires a full bladder. Jewelry and othermetal objects must be removed from area of examination. Risks Related to Surgical Procedure Complication related to anesthesia Injury to ureters, bladder, and/or bowel Hemorrhage Infection Deep vein thrombosis Types of Hysterectomies Total hysterectomy: Removal of the uterus and thecervix Hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy: Removal ofthe uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes, and ovaries Radical hysterectomy: Removal of the uterus, cervix, fal-lopian tubes, ovaries, upper portion of the vagina, andlymph nodes. This is done for some cases of reproductivecancer. Supracervical hysterectomy: Removal of the uterus The type of hysterectomy is determined by the reason for hysterectomy and the age and health status of thewoman. Surgical and Anesthetic Techniques Abdominal hysterectomy: Removal of the uterus andother structures through an abdominal incision. Theexternal incision may be transverse (Pfannestiel), justabove the pubic hairline, or vertical (low umbilicus to just above the pubic hairline.Abdominal hysterectomy is usually the preferred tech-nique when the reason for hysterectomy is related to agynecologic cancer.General anesthesia with an endotracheal tube For gynecologic cancer: in addition to general, epiduralanesthesia may be used for postoperative pain management.Vaginal hysterectomy: The uterus is removed through thevagina. A pericervical incision is used. The woman isplaced in a lithotomy position for the operative procedure.General anesthesia is most common, but also can be donewith epidural or spinal anesthesia. Laparoscope-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH):The woman is placed in a steep Trendelenburg position.Laparoscope and instruments are inserted through smallincisions in the abdomen (Fig. 19-1). The surgeonmanually operates the scope and instruments. Theuterus is removed through the vagina. The hysterectomyis initiated by laparoscopy and subsequent steps are performed vaginally.General anesthesia with endotracheal tube. This is the pre-ferred method due to the CO 2insufflation required for the laparoscopic procedure and the positioning of the womanduring the surgical procedure. CO2insufflation causes an increase in intra-abdominal pressure that can cause intraoperative respiratory com-promise. The insufflation may also cause cardiovascularcompromise from decreased venous return. The steep Trendelenburg position further increasesintra-abdominal pr essure and may increase risk of aspiration. Due to the deep Trendelenburg position, the womanneeds to be monitor ed f or facial and conjunctival edema. If this occurs, extubation following surgery mayneed to be postponed due to increased risk of laryngealedema. Robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy: The womanis placed in a steep Trendelenburg position. Three or foursmall incisions are made near the umbilicus. A laparo-scope and robotic instruments are inserted through theincisions into the abdomen. The laparoscope and roboticinstruments are connected to the computer. The surgeon3704_Ch19_503-538 16/09/13 10:22 AM Page 505UNIT 6 Women's Health 506 controls the movements of the scope and the instrumentsfrom a computer station in the operating room.General anesthesia with an endotracheal tube and withmuscle relaxation: In robotic surgery there is limited accessto the patient due to the bulk of the equipment that is setover the patient. Full muscle relaxation is needed to pre-vent inadvertent patient movement. Due to the deep Trendelenburg position, the woman needsto be monitored for facial and conjunctival edema. If thisoccurs, extubation following surgery may need to be post-poned due to increased risk of laryngeal edema. Preoperative Care for Abdominal HysterectomyMedical Management Physical assessment and health history Laboratory tests\u2014complete blood count, type and cross-match, urinalysis Electrocardiogram NPO 8 hours prior to surgery Nursing Actions Complete the appropriate admission assessments andrequired preoperative forms. Ensure that all required documents, such as history andphysical, current laboratory reports, and consent formsare in the woman's chart. Verify that the woman has been NPO for 8 hours beforesurgery. Complete the surgical checklist, which includes removalof jewelry, eyeglasses/contact lenses, and dentures. Explain to the woman and family or support personswhat the woman can expect before surgery and aftersurgery. Start an IV line and IV fluid as per orders.Have the woman void or insert Foley catheter as perorders. Provide emotional support for the woman and her family/support persons. Address the woman and/or family's questions and/orconcerns. Postoperative Care for Abdominal HysterectomyMedical Management IV therapy Medications for pain management Antibiotic therapy if at risk for infection Hormone replacement therapy if ovaries were removed Progression of diet Foley catheter for 24-48 hours post-surgery Ambulate once recovered from anesthesia Nursing Actions Monitor vital signs as per protocol. Monitor for blood loss\u2014assess for blood on abdominaldressing and perineal pad.The woman will experience small to moderate amounts ofvaginal bleeding for several days. Monitor level of consciousness and level of sensation andfor side effects of anesthesia. Assess lung sounds and assist the woman with deepbreathing and coughing.Teach the woman to splint her abdomen with a pillowwhen she coughs. Assist the woman into a comfortable position and reposi-tion every 2 hours. Assess for pain and provide pain relief via prescribedmedications, use of relaxation techniques, positioning,and/or soothing environment. Assist the woman with ambulation as per orders.Explain to the woman that ambulation decreases her riskfor deep vein thrombosis and facilitates return of intestinalperistalsis, which decreases the amount of gas build-up. Monitor intake and output. D.C. IV as per orders. D.C Foley catheter as per orders. Assess bowel sounds and advance to a regular diet as perorders. Provide opportunities for the woman to ask questions orshare her concerns.The woman may experience emotional symptoms followingsurgery related to hormonal changes and loss of fertility. Provide discharge teaching:Keep the incision area dry, following the surgeon's instruc-tions for bathing and dressing care. Explain that walking is important in helping her to grad-ually return to her pre-surgery activity level. Instruct the woman to follow her surgeon's ordersregarding le vel of activity and heavy lifting. Explain that she may experience light vaginal bleeding forseveral days.

Provide information on pain management techniques. Instruct the woman not to put anything in the vagina(e.g., do not douche, use tampons, or engage in sexualintercourse) until advised by her surgeon. This will decrease the risk of infection. Instruct the woman to notify health care provider if: Increased pain or pain that is not relieved by medication Drainage, bleeding, redness or swelling from the inci-sional site or incr eased bleeding fr om the vagina Leg pain Fever 39\u00b0C/102.2\u00b0F MENSTRUAL DISORDERS Menstrual disorders are the most common women's repro-ductive problem. These include amenorrhea, dysfunctionaluterine bleeding, dysmenorrhea, and 2). The hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovaries are themain sites of regulation of the menstrual cycle. Normal men-strual cycles occur when the hormone levels and feedbackpathway of the hypothalamus-anterior pituitary-ovaries func-tion appropriately. (See Chapter 3 for an overview cycle.)Hypothalamus: Secretes gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH), also ovarian follicles respond to the increase in FSH by producing increasing amounts of estrogen.LH stimulates the ovaries to release the ova and secreteprogesterone. Estrogen and progesterone influence themenstrual cycle. CHRONIC PELVIC PAIN Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is pain in the pelvic region that lasts 6 months or longer and results in functional or psycho-logical disabilities or requires treatment/intervention(Green et al., 2010). CPP is a common medical problem in women. The cause of the pain is often unknown. Whenthe cause of the pain is known, treatment is directed at thecause. When the cause of the pain is unknown, treatmentfocuses on symptom management. The woman will experience a variety of abdominal and/or pelvic pain:Sharp pain Uterine and/or abdominal cramping Steady pain Intermittent pain Pressure or heaviness deep in pelvis Pain during intercourse Pain while having bowel movement (Mayo Clinic, 2009b) TABLE 19-2 MENSTRUAL DISORDERS MENSTRUAL DEFINITIONS, DISORDER SYMPTOMS, SIGNS PATHOPHYSIOLOGY MANAGEMENT Primary amenorrhea Secondary amenorrheaNo menses by age 14 and no secondary sex characteristicsor no menses by age 16 withsecondary sex characteristics No menses in 6 months in a woman who has had normalmenstrual cyclesMay be related to:\u0081Body build (i.e., minimal levelsof body f at) \u0081Heredity (f amily history of delayed menses) \u0081Pituitary function (lack of secre-tion FSH and LH) \u0081Congenital absence of the vagina \u008190% of cases have no identifiablecause.

(2010). Interventional ther-apies for controlling pelvic pain: What is the evidence? Current pain and headachereports, 14, 22-32. Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a complex disorder with multiplecontributing etiologies. The treatment of women with CPPrequires a multidimensional approach given the complex over-lap of possible etiologies. This article reviewed recent literaturein the treatment of CPP. Evidenced-based interventions are: NSAIDs: are the first-line treatment for CPP Antidepressants: used for pain and comorbidities such asdepression or anxiety Anticonvulsants: significant pain relief with use of gabapentineither alone or with amitriptyline Psychotherapy: cognitive behavioral therapy has the greatestempirical evidence of success compared to counseling, grouptherapy, and biofeedback Therapies used in the treatment for endometriosis, intersti-tial cystitis, pelvic adhesive disease, adenomyosis, and pelvicvenous congestion CRITICAL COMPONENT Metabolic Syndrome Metabolic syndrome is a group of conditions that increase an individual's risk for heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.Approximately one third of women with PCOS also have metabolic syndrome. To be diagnosed with the syndrome anindividual needs to have three of the following conditions: Abdominal obesity: a waist circumference in women 35 inches High triglyceride levels: 150 mg/dL Low HDL cholesterol level: 50 mg/dL for women Increased blood pressure: Systolic 130 mm Hg and/or diastolic 85 mm Hg Elevated fasting blood glucose: 110 mg/dL (National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, 2011)Nursing Actions Assess and document location, characteristic, frequency,and quality of pain. Assess effectiveness of pain interventions. Assess level of knowledge regarding cause of pain. Provide teaching as indicated by knowledge assessment. Provide information regarding diagnostic tests or surgeries. Provide information on use of nonpharmacologicaltechniques such as relaxation, guided imagery, hotapplications, and massage. Teach woman to use pain-control measures before painbecomes severe. POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), also known as Stein- Leventhal syndrome, is an endocrine disorder that affects 5% to 10% of women of childbearing age. The etiology is notfully understood, but it is believed that there is a genetic com-ponent to the cause since it occurs in families (DuRant &Leslie, 2009). Women with PCOS have:Elevated levels of secretion of FSH follicular cysts on one or both ovaries producingexcess estrogen (Fig. 19-2)Women with PCOS are at higher risk for: Type 2 diabetesWomen with PCOS are at risk for insulin resistance (the body produces insulin but does not use it properly) and hyperinsulinemia (hyperglycemia present despite high levels of insulin). Obesity increases risk for diabetes.Normal ov ary AM Page 510CHAPTER 19 Alterations in Women's Health 511 Signs and Symptoms (see Critical Component: Primary Characteristics of PCOS) InfertilityPCOS is the most common cause of female infertility; mostwomen with PCOS do not ovulate. Menstrual disordersIrregular, infrequent, and/or absent menstrual periods HirsutismIncreased hair growth on face, chest, stomach, and back Ovarian cysts Obesity Oily skin and acne Pelvic pain Male-pattern baldness CRITICAL COMPONENT Primary Characteristics of PCOS Ovulatory and menstrual dysfunctions Anovulation Amenorrhea or decreased frequency of menses Menorrhagia when menses does occur Hyperandrogenemia Excessive levels of androgens in the body Clinical features of hyperandrogenemia Increased hair growth on face, chest, stomach, and back Severe acne Male-pattern baldness Polycystic ovaries Multiple cysts on the ovaries (Smith & Taylor, 2011)the degree of acne, hirsutism, and abdominal obesity andmay help regulate the menstrual cycle and treat infertility. Nursing Actions PCOS has both physical and psychological effects on thewoman. Body image can be negatively affected by changesstemming from PCOS. Women need opportunities to sharetheir concerns about PCOS and to receive information onmethods to decrease or counteract the effects of PCOS. Areasto discuss with the woman include:Risk factors related to PCOS Weight reduction through diet and exerciseExplain the benefits of weight loss on PCOS. Provide information on healthy diet and assist the womanin developing a healthy diet plan. Treatment options for hirsutismElectrolysis or laser hair removal Treatment options for acne and oily skinEvaluation and treatment by dermatologist Infertility issues Psychological effects of body changes related to PCOSsuch as depression and increased anxiety. ENDOMETRIOSIS Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease in which the presence and growth of endometrial tissue is found outsidethe uterine cavity (see Critical Component: Endometriosis).The tissue responds to the changes in estrogen and pro - gesterone levels of the menstrual cycle.Tissue is estrogen dependent; thus, it is most common during the reproductive years. Tissue and/or lesions are usually found in the peritonealsurfaces of reproductive organs and adjacent structures ofthe pelvis, such as ovaries, fallopian tubes, bladder, bowel,and intestines.The ovaries are the most common sites. Cause of endometriosis is unknown. The primary theoryis that it is due to retrograde menstruation, which trans-ports endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity, andthe tissue adheres to surrounding organs. Other theoriesinclude genetic predisposition, immunologic changes, andhormonal influences (Lentz et al., 2012). Signs and Symptoms One third of women with endometriosis are asymptomatic.The symptoms can vary depending on the location of thelesions. The degree of symptoms does not correlate with thesize of lesions.Pelvic pain and dysmenorrheaBegins a few days before menses and ends at end of menstruation Low back pain Pelvic pressure DyspareuniaMedical Management Lifestyle modificationsDiet and exercise to assist in weight loss, which helps: Reduce risk for type 2 diabetes Decrease levels of androgens Improve the frequency of ovulation and menstruation Reduce risk of cardiovascular disease ( Fig. 19-3 ) Hormone therapyLow-dose hormonal contraceptives for women who do notwish to conceive. These contraceptives inhibit LH produc-tion, decrease testosterone levels, and reduce degree of acneand hirsutism. Fertility therapyMedications that induce ovulation, such as Clomid Assisted reproductive technology (ART), such as in vitrofertilization (IVF), may be used for women who do notrespond to medications. Diabetic medicationsAntidiabetic medications are prescribed to lower blood glu-cose levels. They also can lower testosterone, which reduces3704_Ch19_503-538 16/09/13 10:22 AM Page 511UNIT 6 Women's Health 512 Infertility Premenstrual spotting and menorrhagia Diarrhea, pain with defecation, and constipation (may bepresent with lesions of the bowel) Bloody urine with bladder involvement Fixed retroverted uterus Enlarged and tender usually return within 1-5 years after medica-tions are stopped.Diet and exercise Weight loss frequency of ovulation and menstr uation glucose metabolism androgen levels fertility clinical features of hyper androgenemia risk of type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes risk cardiov ascular disease blood pressure lipid levels Figure 19-3 Effects of weight management in women withPCOS. CRITICAL COMPONENT Endometriosis Abnormal growth of tissue resembling the endometrium thatis present outside of the uterine cavity. Tissue responds to changes in estrogen and progesteronelevels. The tissue grows and thickens during the secretory and proliferativestages of the menstrual cycle. The tissue breaks down and bleeds into the surrounding tissuesduring the menstrual phase. Bleeding into surrounding tissues causes inflammation. Scarring, brosis, and adhesions can result from continuedinflammation. Emotional Impact The physical symptoms of endometriosis can have an effecton the woman's mental health. The woman may experienceanger and grief related to loss of fertility. The pain related toendometriosis can interfere with her social activities, and dys-pareunia can have an effect on intimate relationships. Medical Management Analgesic therapyNSAIDs commonly used for pain management. Hormonal therapyGoal is to suppress menstruation and further growth of tissue.Medication Nafarelin (Synarel) Indication: Endometriosis Action: A synthetic analogue of hormone (GnRH). Prolonged use causes a reduction inserum estrone, E 2, testosterone, and androstenedione. Side effects: Emotional instability, headaches, vaginal dryness, acne, cessation of menses, impaired fertility,decreased libido, hot flashes Route and doses: Intranasal; one spray (200 mcg) in morningin one nostril and one spray (200 mcg) in the other nostril inthe evening up to a maximum of 800 mcg/day.

Patient education on prescribed treatment planInformation on medications, including action, side effects,and dosage Information on surgical intervention INFECTIONS Infections of the reproductive system can increase a woman'srisk for cancer, chronic pain, systemic infections, and infertil-ity. Early interventions can decrease the woman's risk forcomplications related to prolonged or repeated infections ofthe pelvic region. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) PID is an acute infection of the upper genital track that caninvolve the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and can spreadto the peritoneum.Both aerobic trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae the most common agents. Bacterial infections ascend from the vagina and/or cervixto uterus and fallopian tubes and then to ovaries andspread to the peritoneum. Consequences of acute PID are infertility, ectopic preg-nancies, and chronic pelvic pain.Ectopic pregnancy is 10 times greater in women withhistory of PID due to the scarring and adhesions in the fallopian tubes. Scarring and adhesions are theresults of the inflammatory response to the infection that destroys cells and the resulting repair of the damaged tissue. Risk Factors History of sexually transmitted infections (STI) Multiple sexual partners Under age 25 and sexually active75% of cases occur with women under 25 years of age,and it is the most common severe infection of womenages 16-25 years (Lentz et al., 2012). Douching, which can push bacteria upward into uterusand through fallopian tubes Intrauterine devices (IUD)There is an increased risk of PID at time of placement and3 weeks following placement of an IUD.Signs and Symptoms Women with PID present with a wide range of nonspecificsigns and symptoms, which increases the risk of an incorrectdiagnosis.Women may be asymptomatic.This is referred to as atypical or silent PID (Lenza et al.,2012). Severe abdominal, uterine, and ovarian pain and tenderness\u2014most common symptom Irregular menses Abnormal vaginal discharge with foul odor Pain during sexual intercourse Fever (100.4 \u00b0F or 38\u00b0C) Elevated white blood cell (WBC) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ERS) Definitive Criteria for Diagnosing Evidence of metritis on endometrial biopsy Thickened fluid-filled fallopian tubes sonogram or MRI Abnormalities noted during laparoscopic examination Medical Management Treatment is usually provided on an outpatient basis. Test for STI and treat as indicated. Oral antibiotic therapyWoman is reevaluated after 48-72 hours of antibiotictherapy. When PID responds to treatment, the woman should be examined 4-6 weeks later for reevaluation (Lentz,2012). Treatment of sexual partner to decrease the risk of reinfection. Analgesia for pain management Hospitalization with IV antibiotic therapy for women who:are pregnant do not respond to oral antibiotic treatment are unable to follow or tolerate outpatient treatment plan are severely ill have an abscess in fallopian tube or ovaries (Women'sHealth, 2010a) Patient education Nursing Actions Patient education of risk factors for PID Patient education on risk reductionBe in a monogamous sexual relationship with a partner who has been screened for STI and is not infected Use condoms correctly and each time engaged in sexualactivity Avoid douching Patient education regarding proper use of antibiotics Patient education on signs, symptoms, and consequencesof PID3704_Ch19_503-538 16/09/13 10:22 vaginitis, albicans is a gram-positive fungus that lives on all surfaces of the human body. When the vaginal ecosystem is disturbed the fungus rapidly grows,causing an infection. Factors that can affect the vaginalecosystem are:Hormonal changesHigh estrogen levels during pregnancy favor growth offungus. of candida vaginitis preceding andimmediately following menstrual periodVAGINITIS Vaginitis is an inflammation of the vagina. Symptoms of vagini- tis include vaginal discharge than can be malodorous dependingon the causative agent, burning, irritation, or itching.The vaginal flora is a delicate ecosystem primarily com-posed of various lactobacilli, which inhibit the growth of yeast and bacteria. Vaginitis occurs when there is adisruption of the vaginal ecosystem. The most common types of vaginitis are:Candida vaginitis Bacterial vaginosis Trichomoniasis (Table INFECTIONS (STI) SDI CAUSATIVE AGENT MANIFESTATION/SYMPTOMS TREATMENT Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) immunodefi- Women may also have: candidiasis, BV, PID, and menstrual cycle changes. HIV infection is usually diagnosed via the HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody tests. Most common bacterial STI in United States and the leading cause of preventa-ble infertility and ectopic pregnancies.The majority of infected women areasymptomatic; 30% have a mucopurulentcervical discharge. Other symptomsinclude spotting, urethritis, lower abdom-inal pain, nausea, fever, pain during sexual intercourse. Chlamydia is diagnosed via cultures of cervical epithelial cells. Chlamydia can also live in the throat, rectum and urethra. Painless warty growth in the vagina or on the vulva, perineum, or anal areasNo cure for HIV currently exists. Highly active antiretro-viral therapy (HAART) is thestandard treatment. HAARTis effective in maintaining thehealth of HIV-positive womenand in reducing the perinataltransmission of the virus. Antibiotic therapy: \u0081Doxycycline 100 mg orallytwice a day f or 7 days or \u0081Azithromycin 1 gm or ally given in a single dose \u0081Infected partner should alsobe treat ed to decrease risk of reinf ection. Treatment options include:\u0081Topical application of pod-ofilox, which can be applied by the patient \u0081T opical application of trichloroacetic acid, which is 19 Alterations in Women's Health 515 TABLE 19-3 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS (STI)\u2014cont'd SDI CAUSATIVE (HSV), types 1 and 2 (Viral) Neisseria gonorrhoeae(Bacterial) Hepatitis B virus (HBV) (Viral) Treponema pallidum(Bacterial)Infected women may have no or minimal symptoms. Symptoms are similar to thoseof the flu: malaise, muscle aches, andheadaches. Other symptoms can includeitching and burning feeling in the genital oranal areas, vaginal discharge, feeling ofpressure in pelvic area, and lymphadenopa-thy. Lesions (small red bumps or blisters oropen sores) in area where virus entered thebody-cervix, vagina Diagnosis is usually based on patient history and examination. Women are commonly asymptomatic. Symptoms include vaginal discharge, mennorrhagia, postcoital bleeding, lowbackache, urinary frequency, dysuria, andpain during sexual intercourse. Gonorrhea is diagnosed via test such as cultures of the cervical discharge. HBV is found in highest concentrations in the blood and lower concentrations in semen,vaginal secretions, and wound exudates. Sexual intercourse is the most common mode of transmission. Women are often asymptomatic.Symptoms include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominalpain, joint pain, dark-colored urine, clay-colored stools, and jaundice. Symptoms appear 60- 150 days after exposure. Syphilis progresses in stages:Primary syphilis symptom is a single, painless ulcer (chancre) in the genital area, mouth,or point of contact. Appears 10 -90 days after contact. The chancre lasts 4 -6 weeks and usually resolves without treatment. Secondary syphilis symptoms include skin rash, fever, sore throat, lymphadenopathy,muscle aches, weight loss, and fatigue.Appears 6 weeks to 6 months after theappearance of the chancre. If not treated, thesymptoms resolve on own within 2 -10 weeks. Tertiary syphilis: Approximately one-third of infected individuals will develop tertiarysyphilis. Without treatment, the bacteria canspread throughout the body, and symptomsare related to damage of internal organs. Screening tests include rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and Venereal Disease ResearchLaboratory (VDRL).There is no cure herpes. peppermint oil f or symptom management \u0081Use of condoms to preventspread of virus Recommended ther apy is sin- gle IM dose of cef triaxone given in combination with pro -azithromycin or doxycycline. Infected partner should be treated to decrease risk ofreinfection. There is no specific treatment for acute HBV. Therapy isdirected at symptom manage-ment. Antiviral medicationsare used for chronic HBV. Penicillin G is the treatment of choice. The specific regimendepends on the length ofinfection. Infected partner should be treated to decrease risk ofreinfection. Continued3704_Ch19_503-538 16/09/13 10:22 AM Page 515UNIT Depressed cell-mediated immunityWomen taking exogenous corticosteroids or with AIDS are at higher risk for reoccurring candida vaginitis. Antibiotic useLactobacillus, which inhibits the growth of fungi, is part ofthe normal vaginal bacteria flora. Certain broad-spectrumantibiotics, such as penicillin and tetracycline, can destroylactobacillus allowing the rapid growth of Candida albicans (Lentz, 2012).Medical Management Diagnosis with a wet smear of vaginal secretions Most vaginal yeast infections can be treated with over-the-counter suppository is placed into the vaginafor 1-7 days depending on the formulation. Health care provider needs to be contacted if symptomscontinue for more than a week or if symptoms are recurrent. Pregnant women need to consult with their health careprovider before using OTC remedies. Women with suppressed immune systems need to be treatedby health care provider because candidal infections canaffect various internal organs. Fluconazole (Diflucan), an antifungal prescriptionmedication, is given when OTCs are not effective orwhen there is a severe infection. Treatment is a single-dose oral dose of 150 mg. The safety of use duringpregnancy has not been established. It is usually com-patible with women who are lactating 6-month course of fluconazole. Nursing Actions Teach the woman proper use of OTC medications. Instruct the woman to notify health care provider ifsymptoms continue or are recurrent.Women can mistake bacteria vaginitis for Candidavaginitis, which has a different treatment plan.TABLE 19-3 asymptomatic. Symptoms appear 5 -28 days after exposure. Symptoms include profuse frothy gray or yellow-green vaginal discharge with foulodor; Small, red ulcerations in the vagina and/or on cervix may be observed during examination. Diagnosis: Microscopic evaluation to confirm trichomoniasis or rapid trichomoniasis test Metronidazole (Flagyl) is med- ication of choice. It may beadministered as a single doseof 2 grams orally or 500 mgorally twice a day for 7 days. Partner needs to be treated at same time and condoms usedto prevent future infections. Women should be advised not to drink alcohol for 24 hoursafter completing metronida-zole therapy. The combinationof alcohol and medication cancause flushing, nausea, cramping. CRITICAL COMPONENT Candida Vaginitis Candida vaginitis is common in women of childbearing age.Three out of four women will experience at least one occurrenceof Candida vaginitis within their lifetime. Risk Factors Suppressed immune system Antibiotic therapy Steroid therapy Diabetes Pregnancy Menopause Signs and Symptoms Itching and irritation in the vulva and vagina areas arethe primary symptoms. White, cheesy vaginal discharge Pain with sexual intercourse Burning on urination Vaginal pH below 4.53704_Ch19_503-538 16/09/13 10:22 AM Page 516CHAPTER 19 Alterations in Women's Health 517 Instruct the woman to contact health care provider if anyof the following occur:Bloody discharge Abdominal pain Fever Instruct the woman to wear cotton underwear to decreaserisk of recurrent infections. Bacterial Vaginosis Bacterial vaginosis (BV), the most common vaginal infection,occurs when there is a disruption in the normal vaginal flora;a decrease in lactobacilli and an increase in organisms mycoplasms, peptostreptococci, and gardnerella (seeCritical Component: Bacterial Vaginosis).Nursing Actions Provide education on proper administration, actions, andside effects of medications. Instruct women who are taking Flagyl PO to take with meals and avoid drinking alcohol. The combina-tion of Flagyl and alcohol can cause severe nausea and vomiting, flushing, tachycardia, and shortness ofbreath. Provide information on signs and symptoms of possiblerecurrence that the woman should report to health careprovider. Provide information of risk factors for BV. Sexually Transmitted Infections The terms sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and sexually trans- mitted diseases (STDs) are used interchangeably in the clinical setting. STIs are primarily transmitted through vaginal inter-course, anal intercourse, and oral sex (see Critical Component:Sexually Transmitted Infections [STIs]). Table 19-3 summarizesthe most common STI.Chlamydia and gonorrhea are prevalent in the adolescentpopulation and are the two most reported infectious diseases in the United States. Women can have a STI and be asymptomatic.Women who are asymptomatic are still at risk for infectingtheir sexual partner. Both the woman and her partner need to be treated forthe STI to decrease risk of reinfection.CRITICAL COMPONENT Bacterial Vaginosis Women who experience abnormal vaginal discharge need tobe seen by their health care providers since symptoms of BVare similar to those of chlamydia, gonorrhea, candidiasis,and trichomoniasis. Women with BV are at greater risk for preterm labor andmetritis. BV is more common in lesbians and bisexual women than inheterosexual women. CRITICAL COMPONENT Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) Untreated STI places a woman at risk for: Cervical cancer Pelvic inflammatory disease Infertility due to blocked fallopian tubes Ectopic pregnancy due to blocked fallopian tubes Chronic pelvic painRisk Factors New sexual partner\u2014male or female Multiple sexual partners Lesbian couples who share sex toys without cleaning thetoy between use DouchingDouching can alter the normal vaginal flora Antibiotic therapyAntibiotics can alter the normal vaginal flora. Signs and Symptoms Vaginal odor, often described as fishy smelling. Vaginal discharge that is often thin and white or gray;may also be described as milky Medical Management Microscopic examination of vaginal discharge to rule outother causes such as candidiasis and trichomoniasis Gynecological examination to assess the appearance ofthe vaginal lining and the cervix Pharmacological therapy:Metronidazole\u2014Taken orally in pill form or insertedvaginally in a gel form Clindamycin\u2014Taken orally in pill form or inserted vagi-nally in gel form Miconazole\u2014Inserted vaginally in form of suppository orcream Male partner does not need to be treated. Female partner may need treatment.Lesbians and STI Lesbians and bisexual women are at the same risk for STI asheterosexual women. The types of sexual behavior that carrya risk for STI between women are:Oral-vaginal/vulval contact: and HPV (County of Los AM Page 517UNIT 6 Women's Health 518 Nursing Actions Provide information on transmission and treatment of STI. Provide information on methods to decrease risk of STI.Be in a monogamous sexual relationship with a partnerwho has been screened for STI and is not infected. Use condoms correctly and each time engaged in sexualactivity. Talk with partner about STI and the use of condomsbefore engaging in sexual activities. Talk with your health care provider and your sexualpartner about any STI you or your partner presently hasor had in the past. Follow current guidelines for frequency of pelvic exams,Pap test, and HPV testing. Urinary Tract Infections (UTI) It is estimated that 20% of women will encounter a UTIduring their lifetime (American College of Obstetriciansand Gynecologists [ACOG], 2008). Women are 30 times more likely than men to develop aUTI because of the shorter length of the female urethraand proximity of urethra to rectum. Escherichia coli, which is normally found in the colon, isthe most common bacteria responsible for UTI. Chlamydia can place a woman at risk for UTI. Untreated UTI places the woman at risk forpyelonephritis. Diagnosis of UTI is usually based on presenting symp-toms and urinalysis. A urine culture and sensitivity maybe required. Risk Factors Young girls and menopausal women (see CriticalComponent: UTI and Older Women) Altered immunity Diabetes Urinary tract obstructions Pregnancy Sexual activityIrritation of the urethra during sexual activity can cause bacteria to migrate upward into the urinary tract. Allergic reaction to certain ingredients in soaps, vaginalcreams, and bubble baths Signs and Symptoms Dysuria Urinary frequency Urgency Sensation of bladder fullness Suprapubic tenderness Cloudy, foul-smelling urine Backache and pelvic pain FeverMedical Management Antibiotic therapy is used for uncomplicated UTI. Medicationsmost commonly used are:Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole Augmentin)CRITICAL COMPONENT UTI and Older Women Older women are more susceptible to UTI due to: Suppressed immune system Weakened muscles of the bladder that increases the riskfor incomplete emptying of the bladder Decreased levels of estrogen which can alter the normalvaginal flora allowing for growth of E. coli, which canspread to the urinary tract. Older women usually do not present with the common signsof UTI such as fever. When fever does occur, it is related to a serious UTI andneeds immediate treatment. UTI places a stress on the body, and in older women thestress can cause confusion and abrupt changes in behavior. Symptoms of UTI in older women can include: Confusion or delirium Agitation Hallucinations Poor motor skills or dizziness Falling Medication Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) Indication: Urinary tract infection (also used for treatmentof otitis media, pneumonia) Action: Inhibits the metabolism of folic acid in bacteria Common side effects: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, andrashes Route and dosage: PO; 160 TMP/800 hours for 10-14 days (Vallerand & Sanoski, 2013) Nursing Actions Teach women to take full course of antibiotic therapy. Provide information on strategies to promote bladderhealth and ways to decrease risk for developing UTI.Drink 2-4 quarts of fluid each day. Void every 2-4 hours; avoid postponing urination becausewhen urine remains in the bladder for prolonged periods,it allows increased time for bacteria to multiply. Empty bladder before and after intercourse to flush outbacteria in the urethra. Remain hydrated to keep bacteria flushed out of the urinary tract system.3704_Ch19_503-538 16/09/13 10:22 AM Page 518CHAPTER 19 Alterations in Women's Health 519 Drink cranberry juice to acidify the urine. Wipe the urethral meatus and perineum from front to backafter voiding. Wear cotton underpants and change daily; avoid tight-fitting underwear and pants. Avoid caffeine and alcohol since these can irritate thebladder. Do not douche or use feminine hygiene products that canalter the normal vagina flora. Avoid harsh soaps, powders, sprays; avoid bubble baths. Teach women about the signs and symptoms of UTI tobe reported to their health care providers. LEIOMYOMA OF THE UTERUS Leiomyomas of the uterus, also referred to as myomas or uterine fibroids, are benign fibrous tumors of the uterine wall.Leiomyomas:Are the most common tumors in women Vary in size and location Are estrogen-and-progesterone sensitive Growth is seen during the reproductive years due to theincrease in hormone production. Risk Factors Early menarche Increasing age during reproductive years\u2014as women age,their risk for leiomyomas increases. Low parity Tamoxifin use Obesity (Lentz, 2012) Signs and Symptoms Leiomyomas are usually asymptomatic. The severity of symp-toms is related to the number, size, and locations of themyomas. Symptoms can include:Pelvic pressure from the enlarging mass Dysmenorrhea, metrorrhagia, menorrhagiaWomen are at risk for anemia due to menorrhagia. Pelvic pain Urinary frequency and urgency when myomas are press-ing on the bladder Palpation of tumor during bimanual pelvic examination Medical Management Pelvic ultrasound to confirm diagnosis of tumors and ruleout pregnancy Routine pelvic examinations every 6 months to assess rateof growth Blood transfusions may be needed for severe anemiarelated to excessive blood loss. Treatment for leiomyomas is based on the size and loca-tion of the tumors, the degree to which they interferewith the woman's quality of life, and whether the womandesires pregnancy. Most tumors will shrink aftermenopause. Treatment options include:GnRH agonists for three months to control bleeding andshrink tumor Uterine artery embolization (UAE) Polyvinyl alcohol pellets are injected into selected bloodvessels to block the blood supply to the tumor andcause it to shrink . Laser surgery: Laser coagulation vaporizes the fibroids and producesnecrosis. Can incr ease risk for infertility due to uterine scarring. Myomectomy, removal of the tumor, is common for symp-tomatic women who desire pregnancy. Hysterectomy is recommended for women who do notdesire pregnancy and who are experiencing excess bleeding. Leiomyomas are the most common indication for hyster ectomy. Nursing Actions Nursing actions vary based on the method of medical or sur-gical treatment. Nurses are most likely to care for womenwho are being treated for myomas in the inpatient settingfollowing a hysterectomy. (See section on hysterectomy.) OVARIAN CYSTS Ovarian cysts are enclosed sacs that contain fluid, blood,and/or cells. The cysts develop inside or on the surface of theovaries. Ovarian cysts are often discovered during routinepelvic examinations. Two of the more common types of ovar-ian are a benign tumor, is the most frequent cyst that occurs on the ovary.Develops during the follicular phase (first half of themenstrual cycle). Forms when the dominant mature follicle fails to rupture(ovulate) and begins to fill with fluid or when an imma-ture follicle fails to degenerate (Lentz, 2012). Usually are asymptomatic.One-quarter of women report pain and/or sensation ofheavy, achy feeling in the pelvis. Diagnosis is usually based on symptoms and bimanualexamination.Ultrasonography may be used to aid in the diagnosis andto rule out pregnancy, but ultrasound cannot provide adefinitive diagnosis. CA 125 blood test: this is elevated in women with ovariancancer, but can also be elevated in women withendometriosis, myomas, and PID. Laparoscopic surgery to visualize ovaries and/or remove cyst Important to rule out ovarian cancer3704_Ch19_503-538 16/09/13 10:22 AM Page 519UNIT 6 Women's Health 520 Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is the descent of pelvic organs into the vagina or against the vaginal wall. Organs thatcan be involved are:Bladder Urethra Uterus Rectum Risk Factors Childbirth trauma related to:Vaginal deliveries Large babies Forceps or vacuum deliveries Poor suturing techniques with repair of episiotomies or lacerations Pelvic trauma, i.e., pelvic surgery Stress and strain from heavy lifting Obesity Menopause Low levels of estrogen weaken the pelvic floor muscles.Common disorders related to POP are uterine prolapse, cystocele, and rectocele (Fig. 19-4). Uterine Prolapse Uterine prolapse occurs when there is a weakening of the pelvic connective tissue, pubococcygeus muscle, and uterineligaments, allowing the uterus to descend into the vagina. Assessment Findings Protrusion of uterus into the vagina Low backache Sensation of heaviness in the pelvis or vagina Sensation that the uterus is falling out Difficult or painful intercourse Medical Management Vaginal pessary: A rubber or silicone-based ring that isplaced in the vagina and supports the uterus; is used in amild degree of prolapse (Fig. 19-5). Surgery, which may include hysterectomy Nursing Actions Explain the importance of Kegel exercises for improvingpelvic muscle strength and teach the woman how to doKegel exercises. Instruct the woman on the treatment and prevention ofconstipation, such as a high-fiber diet and increased fluidintake. This will help in reducing straining during defe-cation and decrease stress on existing POP. Instruct the woman to avoid heavy lifting to decreasestress on pelvic organs. Explain the relationship between increased weight andincreased risk of prolapsed uterus and discuss weightreduction strategies. Provide post-operative care for women having a hysterectomy.Most cysts spontaneously disappear either by reabsorp-tion of the fluid within the cyst or by rupturing within 8 weeks (Lentz, 2012). Monitoring condition with a repeat examination in 6-8 weeks is the treatment plan of choice when thesymptoms are mild.NSAIDs may be used for pain management. Surgical removal if cyst:Continues to be present after several menstrual cycles Occurs after menopause Postmenopausal women with ovarian cysts have a higherrisk of ovarian cancer. Enlarges Has an unusual appearance on the ultrasound Causes severe pain Corpus Luteum Cysts Corpus luteum cysts form from the corpus luteum during the luteal phase (second half of the menstrual cycle). Normally,the corpus luteum forms after ovulation and gradually degen-erates if pregnancy does not occur. Occasionally, the corpusluteum seals and fills with fluid or blood and forms a cyst.The woman may experience acute lower abdominalpain and delayed menses followed by menorrhagia(Lentz, 2012). Diagnosis is usually based on symptoms and bimanualexamination.Endovaginal ultrasound may be used to aid diagnosis andrule out pregnancy. CA 125 blood test to aid in ruling out ovarian cancer Most cysts spontaneously disappear within 1-2 menstrualcycles.Oral contraceptives may be prescribed to inhibit ovulation,which decreases risk of developing additional cysts. Large cysts that do not resolve on own within 3 months mayrequire surgical intervention, usually a cystectomy. Occasionally, a cyst ruptures and causes sudden and severeabdominal pain and may require surgical interventionand blood transfusions. Rupture of the cyst can be caused by coitus, exercise,lower abdominal trauma, or pelvic e xam and can cause intraperitoneal bleeding. DISORDERS OF PELVIC SUPPORT The most common disorders of pelvic support include pelvicorgan prolapse, genital fistulas, and urinary incontinence. Pelvic Organ Prolapse The pelvic organs are supported by several structures:Pelvic floor muscles Pelvic ligaments Pelvic fasciaWhen these structures are weakened, a disorder referred to as pelvic organ prolapse can occur.3704_Ch19_503-538 16/09/13 10:22 AM Page 520CHAPTER 19 pessary. Cystocele and Rectocele Cystocele: Bulging of the bladder into the vagina. This occurs when the wall between the vagina and bladderweakens and stretches. Rectocele: Bulging of the rectum into the vagina. This occurs when the wall between the vagina and the rectumweakens and stretches. Assessment Findings for Cystocele Bulging mass in the anterior vaginal wall Sense of fullness or pressure in the vaginal area Straining, coughing, bearing down, lifting, or standing fora prolonged period of time increases the degree of bulging Stress incontinence Bladder infections Urine leakage during intercourse Sexual dysfunction such as dyspareunia, vaginal dryness,and irritation (Lentz, 2012) Assessment Findings for Rectocele Bulging mass in the posterior vaginal wall Straining and prolonged standing can increase the degreeof the bulging. Irritation of the vaginal mucosa Constipation3704_Ch19_503-538 16/09/13 10:22 AM Page 521UNIT 6 Women's Health 522 Medical Management Medical management is based on degree of bulging, effectson the woman's quality of life, and health of the woman.Treatment options include:Pessary Hormone replacement therapy Surgery Nursing Actions Explain the importance of Kegel exercises for improvingpelvic muscle strength and teach the woman how to doKegel exercises. Instruct the woman on the treatment and prevention ofconstipation, such as a high-fiber diet and increased fluidintake. This will help in reducing straining during defe-cation and decrease stress on existing POP. Instruct the woman to avoid heavy lifting to decreasestress on pelvic organs. Explain the relationship between increased weight andincreased risk of cystoceles/rectoceles and discuss weightreduction strategies. Genital Fistulas Genital fistulas are abnormal connections between the vaginaand bladder, vagina and urethra, and/or vagina and rectum.The fistula provides a pathway for fecal material or urine toenter the vagina. Risk Factors Trauma of tissue related to childbirth Hysterectomy\u2014injury to surrounding tissue Pelvic radiotherapy\u2014radiation can damage and weakenpelvic tissue Violent coitus or sexual abuse\u2014perforation of tissuecaused by forced intercourse Crohn's disease\u2014weakening of tissue related to inflammation Assessment Findings Leakage of urine or fecal material from the vagina Foul vaginal odor Irritation of the vaginal mucosa Medical Management Pelvic, rectal, and perineal skin exams to determine thelocation and severity of fistula. Small fistulas may resolve on their own if tissue isallowed to rest. Larger fistulas may require surgical repair. Nursing Actions Reinforce teaching and clarify information provided bythe primary health care provider. Postoperative care:Assess vital signs as per protocol. Assess perineal area for increased bleeding.Assess for pain and use appropriate pain managementtechniques. Provide post-operative teaching: Instruct the woman with rectal fistula repair to increasefiber in her diet and incr ease fluid intake to decrease risk of constipation. Maintaining soft stool decreasestrauma to the site and promotes healing. Explain the importance of sitz baths to promote healingand comf or t. Sitz baths are usually prescribed. Provide medication information. Antibiotics are usuallyprescribed. Instruct to notify sur geon when there is an elevated temper atur e, increased bleeding, or increased pain. Urinary Incontinence Urinary incontinence is the loss of bladder incontinence can range from stress urinary incontinence tosudden urge to void followed by uncontrolled voiding.Stress incontinence is leakage of urine when there is an increase in intra-abdominal pressure related to such eventsas coughing, sneezing, and laughing. Urinary incontinencecan have a profound effect on the woman's quality of life by limiting her activities due to the embarrassment ofuncontrolled urination. Risk Factors Childbirth Aging, which leads to a decrease in estrogen and a weakening of muscles, which decreases the ability of the urethra to remain closed Obesity\u2014the risk increases for every 5 units of body massindex increase (Lentz, 2012). Smoking, which causes chronic coughing and placesstress on the urinary sphincters Diabetes\u2014neuropathy Assessment Findings Leakage of urine when coughing, sneezing, laughing, orlifting Sudden and intense urge to void followed by uncontrolledvoiding Medical Management Treatment is based on the degree of incontinence and theeffect it has on quality of life. Behavioral techniquesBladder training: Waiting 5 minutes from feeling the urgeto void to urinating and gradually increasing the timebetween urge to voiding Scheduled toilet trips: Developing a schedule for voidingand not waiting to feel the urge to void Limiting alcohol and caffeine use: These act as a bladderstimulant and as a diuretic. Losing weight Pelvic floor exercisesKegel exercises: Improve pelvic floor muscle strength3704_Ch19_503-538 16/09/13 10:22 AM Page 522CHAPTER 19 Alterations in Women's Health 523 MedicationsAnticholinergic drugs (Detrol): Used for overactivebladders Estrogen cream applied to the genital tissues: Improves thetone and tissue in the urethral and vaginal areas Medical devicesPessary: Inserted in the vagina; helps hold the bladder in place Urethral insert: A small tampon-like disposable plug thatthe woman inserts into urethra prior to activities thatcan cause stress incontinence, such as sport activity orexercise. The plug is removed after the activity and priorto voiding. SurgeryBREAST DISORDERS Breast disorders include both benign and malignant diseases.Discovery of a breast mass or changes in the breast can evoke a woman's feelings of fear and anxiety that she mayhave cancer. The three most common breast symptoms are:PainPain is usually related to hormonal changes and is mostcommon in perimenopausal women. Pain can also be asso-ciated with cysts of the breast. Less than 10% of womenwith breast cancer will present solely with pain. DischargeNipple discharge is not a frequent symptom of breast cancer. Discharge from the nipple is classified as spontaneous orelicited. Elicited discharge is discharge that is the result ofnipple compression or stimulation. Elicited discharge from both nipples that is milky in colorand nonbloody is considered normal. Spontaneous discharge or elicited discharge from one nippleor discharge that is bloody needs further evaluation. Breast massPalpable breast masses are common and are usually benign,but all breast masses need to be evaluated to rule outmalignancy. Breast self-examination (BSE), clinical breast examina- tions, and mammography are important in the early detectionand treatment of benign and cancerous tumors of the breast(see Chapter 18 for recommended screening and testing). Fibrocystic Changes Fibrocystic changes, also known as benign breast disease(BBD), are fluid-filled cysts and are the most common benignbreast condition.Fibrocystic changes occur in over 50% of women andmore often in women in their 20s and 30s. The cysts are often tender to touch and fluctuate in sizein response to the menstrual cycle. Fibrocystic development may be related to an imbalanceof estrogen and progesterone. Caffeine intake may exacerbate the condition.Medication Tolterodine (Detrol) Action: Inhibits cholinergic mediated bladder contractions. Common side effects: Dry mouth, headache, and dizziness Route and dosage: PO; 2 mg twice daily (Data from Vallerand & Sanoski, 2013) Nursing Actions Instruct the woman on the importance of Kegel exercisesand teach her how to do Kegel exercises. Instruct the woman on the treatment and prevention ofconstipation by increasing fiber in the diet and increasingfluid intake. Instruct her to avoid heavy lifting. Explain the relationship between increased weight andincreased risk of urinary incontinence and discuss weightreduction strategies. Maintain skin integrity by instructing the woman to keepthe area clean and dry. Encourage the woman to decrease alcohol and caffeineintake, as both cause an increase in urination. Provide strategies for retraining the bladder, such asscheduling toileting times and gradually increasing thewait time after she feels the urge to void. Spencer, J. (2012). Continence promotion. Nursing of women's health, 16, 327-340. Urinary incontinence is common in women ages 35 and older, yet it often goes untreated due to underreporting by women to their health care provider. The author reports on the results of a program designed toimprove women's knowledge and perspective on urinary inconti-nence and to encourage care-seeking behaviors. The continencepromotion program was an hour-long session that provided infor-mation on the prevalence and types/causes of incontinence andthe different methods to promote continence. Each participantreceived a \"toolkit\" that included a PowerPoint presentation, edu-cation video, knowledge questionnaire, and a brochure address-ing incontinence issues. Pretest and posttest along with a oneEvidence-Based Practice: Incontinence month follow-up phone call were used to evaluate the program.There were measureable changes in the participants' knowledgelevel at the end of the session, and participants reported behaviorchanges during the one month follow-up phone call.Implications: It is important that women understand that incontinence does not have to be an inevitable part of aging and that there aretreatment options. Nurses can have a major role in continencepromotion through community educational programs address-ing urinary incontinence. \"Toolkit\" accessed at www.continenceconversation.com3704_Ch19_503-538 16/09/13 10:22 AM Page 523UNIT 6 Women's Health 524 Signs and Symptoms Cyclic bilateral breast pain\u2014pain is usually in the upper,outer quadrants of the breasts. Increased engorgement and density of the breasts Increased nodularity of the breasts Fluctuation in the size of the cystic areas Medical Management Differentiate between fibrocystic changes and breastcancer using mammogram and ultrasound. Health careprovider may also aspirate the cyst for evaluation offluid. Management centers on symptom relief Diuretics during the premenstrual phase of cycle Supportive bra\u2014wearing a sports bra day and night Oral contraceptives\u2014symptoms return in 40% of the womenafter they discontinue the therapy (Lentz, 2012) Danazol may be prescribed for severe symptoms.

Provide information on methods of symptom relief, suchas heat to breast and supportive bra. Breast Cancer Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in theUnited States. One in eight women will have breast cancer atsome point in her life. Breast cancer in early stages usually produces no symptoms and cannot be felt on palpation. Thewoman's prognosis improves with early detection and treatment(see Critical Component: Breast Cancer Screening Tool). Risk Factors The major risk factors are:Increasing age:Age is the main risk factor. 85% of breast cancers occur in women after age 40; thisincreases into the 70s and then decreases. GeographicWomen in the United States, Western Europe, andAustralia have the highest rates of breast cancer comparedwith other countries (Lentz, 2012). Defects in breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) or breast cancer gene 2 (BRCA 2) Biopsy-confirmed atypical hyperplasia (ACS, 2012) Mammographically dense breasts (ACS, 2012) Personal history of breast cancer in at least one breast Additional factors include:High endogenous estrogen or testosterone levels High bone density (ACS, 2012)Family history of breast cancer Exposure to chest radiation Excess weight Exposure to estrogen: Early onset of menarche, latemenopause, or use of hormone therapy Smoking Exposure to carcinogens Excessive use of alcohol Exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) Diagnosis The screening and diagnostic procedures/tests used in thediagnosis of breast cancer may include (Fig. 19-6):Diagnostic mammograms\u2014images of the area of concernthat provide additional information on size and characterof the mass Breast ultrasounds\u2014assist in determining if the area ofconcern is a fluid-filled cyst or solid mass Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\u2014useful in differen-tiating benign from malignant tissue, especially in womenwith dense, fibroglandular breasts and from scar tissueand new tumors in women who have had previouslumpectomy (Lentz, 2012 ) Breast biopsy\u2014diagnostic test that can distinguishbetween benign and malignant tissue Indicators of Disease Prognosis Stage of cancer (Table 19-4)Type and tumor size Presence of lymph node involvement Presence of hormone receptor levels Presence of HER2/neu (human epidermal growth factorreceptor 2) in the tumor tissue CRITICAL COMPONENT Breast Cancer Screening Tool A breast cancer screening tool developed by the NationalCancer Institute (NCI) and National Surgical Adjuvant Breastand Bowel Project (NSABP) estimates a woman's risk ofdeveloping invasive breast cancer in 5 years and up to age 90. It considers data such as the woman's age, family history ofbreast cancer, and previous breast biopsies. It can be accessed at www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool (National Cancer Institute [NCI], 2011) Medical Management Treatment is determined by stage of cancer. The breastcancer staging system goes from stage 0 (ductal carcinomain situ, the earliest form of breast cancer) to stage IV (thecancer has metastasized to distant organs or to distantlymph nodes).3704_Ch19_503-538 16/09/13 10:22 AM Page 524CHAPTER 19 Alterations in Women's Health 525 Routine screening/care 25% ha ve changes that indicate need for additional testing75% OK Routine or 6 month follow-up 20% cancer diagnosis 20% late exam by MD/NP Diagnostic mammogr am Ultrasound; MRI Blood labor atory test Breastbiopsy10% ha ve changes noted that require additional ev aluationScreening Mammogr am90% normal results Figure 19-6 Breast cancer diagnosis process.

The cancer has spread to dist a nt organs or lymph nodes distant from the breast. The most common sites are the bone, liver, brain, or lung.TABLE 19-4 STAGING OF BREAST CANCER\u2014cont'd Medical management requires a multitreatment approach of surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy.Surgical interventionsLumpectomy: The lump and an area of surrounding nor-mal tissue are removed. This procedure is usually followedby radiation therapy. Partial or segmental mastectomy: The tumor, the sur-rounding breast tissue, a portion of the lining of the chestwall, and some of the axillary lymph nodes are removed.This procedure is usually followed by radiation therapy. Simple mastectomy: All the breast tissue along with thearea surrounding the nipple and areola are removed. Thisprocedure may be followed by radiation therapy,chemotherapy, or hormone therapy. Modified radical mastectomy: The entire breast and severalaxillary lymph nodes are removed; the chest wall is left intact. Some women who have mastectomies choose to undergobreast reconstruction. Breast reconstruction, when desired,is performed by a plastic surgeon at the same time as themastectomy. Radiation therapyTwo types of radiation therapy External radiation: A radiation therapy machine aimsradiation toward the tumor . Treatments are given 5 days a week for 5-6 weeks. Internal radiation (mammo site): A radioactive sub-stance sealed in needles, seeds, wir es, or a catheter are placed directly into or near the tumor. Treatments aregiven twice a day for 5 days for a total of 10 sessions. Radiation therapy usually begins 3-4 weeks after surgery. ChemotherapyOncotype DX test may be performed to determine if thewoman is likely to benefit from chemotherapy (see CriticalComponent: Oncotype DX Test).Chemotherapy is most commonly used to treat advancedmetastatic cancer or to prevent recurrence of cancer. Usually, a combination of two or more drugs is used. Chemotherapy agents may be administered orally or intravenously. Generally, four to eight treatments are given over 6-8 months. Hormone therapySome breast cancer cells require estrogen to grow and are classified as estrogen-receptor positive. This meansthat the cancer cells have a protein to which estrogenbinds. Antiestrogen medications such as tamoxifen (Nolvadex-D) bind to these protein receptors, blockingestrogen binding and reducing the influence of estrogenon the tumor. Fulvestrant (Faslodex) given by injection reduces thenumber of estrogen receptors on breast tumors. Aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole (Arimidex)may be used in postmenopausal women whose cancer is classified as estrogen-receptor positive. Aromataseinhibitors interfere with the amount of estrogen pro-duced by the woman's body tissue (not the ovaries) byblocking the conversion of androgens into estrogens. Targeted therapyTratuzumab (Herceptin), a monoclonal antibody thatdirectly targets the HER2 protein of breast tumors, is atreatment option for women with breast cancer that overproduce HER2 (ACS, 2012). Nursing Actions Provide emotional support to the woman and family.Provide opportunities for the woman and family to sharetheir feeling and concerns.3704_Ch19_503-538 16/09/13 10:22 AM Page 526CHAPTER 19 Alterations in Women's Health 527 Provide current, evidence-based information to thewoman and family regarding treatment options.Encourage the woman to consider all options and seek otheropinions or other professionals if she is not comfortable withrecommendations. Provide information on methods that address side effectsfrom treatment (Tables 19-5 and 19-6) Provide information on nutrition that promotes healingand enhances the immune system. Provide information on complementary modalities suchas imagery, journal writing, and hypnosis that can be usedto diminish side effects from cancer treatment therapies. Provide information regarding community resources.Look Good .... Feel Better is a free program that helpswomen learn beauty techniques to restore their self-imageand cope with appearance-related side effects of cancertreatment (ACS, 2012). Breast cancer support such as American Cancer SocietyReach to Recovery Program CRITICAL COMPONENT Oncotype DX Test Oncotype DX test is a genomic assay that assesses the activ-ity of 21 different genes taken from a tissue sample of thecancer tumor. The Oncotype DX test assists the health care provider indetermining if the cancer is: likely to recur likely to benefit from chemotherapy Women with stage I or II, estrogen-receptor-positive (ER+)breast cancer that has not spread to the lymph nodes maybenet from this test in determining type of cancer treatment. (Breastcancer.org, 2010)Medication Tamoxifen (Nolvadex-D) Indications: Reduces risk of breast cancer in women whoare at increased risk for developing breast cancer; treatmentof breast cancer Action: Competes with estrogen for binding sites in the breast Serious side effects: Pulmonary embolism, stroke, uterinemalignancies Common side effects: Vaginal dryness, hot flashes, jointpain, leg cramps, nausea Route and dose: PO; 10-20 mg twice daily or 20 mg dailyfor 5 years (Vallerand, & Sanoski, 2013; NCI, 2008) GYNECOLOGICAL CANCERS Cervical Cancer Forty years ago, cervical cancer was the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. It is now rated as the 14th leadingcause of cancer related deaths (Eheman et al., 2012). Thisdecrease in cervical cancer-related death can be attributed to women getting Pap tests, which aids in detecting cervicalcancer at an early stage.The human papillomavirus (HPV) is the primary cause ofcervical cancer.50% of all sexually active men and women will get HPVat some point in their lives (CDC, 2009). Pap test is used for cervical cytological screening (see recommended screenings and immunizations for womenacross the life span in Chapter 18).Women with abnormal cervical cytology screening needfurther evaluation, since the Pap test is a screening test TABLE 19-5 MANAGEMENT OF RADIATION SIDE EFFECTS Side effects, except for fatigue, are directly related and limited to the site being treated with radiation therapy, e.g., radiation therapy for breast cancer does not cause diarrhea. SIDE EFFECT WAYS TO MANAGE Diarrhea: Related to damage of healthy cells in large and small intestine\u0081Drink 8 -12 cups of clear liquids. \u0081Gatorade or Pedialyte for electrolyte replacement \u0081Eat small frequent meals. \u0081Five to six small meals rather than three large meals \u0081Eat foods that provide nourishment without increasing risk for diarrhea. \u0081Foods that are low in fiber, fat, and lactose \u0081Fresh fruit \u0081Cooked vegetables \u0081Take antidiarrheal \u0081Take care of \u0081Use baby \u0081Take sitz baths Continued3704_Ch19_503-538 16/09/13 10:22 AM Page 527UNIT 6 Women's Health 528 TABLE 19-5 MANAGEMENT OF RADIATION SIDE EFFECTS\u2014cont'd SIDE EFFECT WAYS TO MANAGE Fatigue: Related to anemia, depression, infection, and medications Sexual and fertility changes: Related to damage to healthy tissue of the vagina and ovaries Skin changes: Related to damage of healthy tissue Urinary and bladder changes: Related to damage of healthy cells of bladder and urinary tract, causing inflammation, ulcers, and infections NCI, 2007\u0081Get 8 hours of sleep per night. \u0081The woman may need more sleep per night than she needed before radiation therapy \u0081Plan time to rest. \u0081Take 10- to 15-minute rest breaks throughout the day. \u0081Take several naps during the day. \u0081Decrease daily activities \u0081The woman may not have enough energy for all the activity she used to do. She shouldselect the activities that are most impor t ant to her and limit those that are less important. \u0081Exercise \u008115-30 minut es of daily e xercise improves overall feeling of well-being. \u0081Change work schedule. \u0081May need to decrease work hours for a few weeks. \u0081Ask family and friends for help at home. \u0081Fertility \u0081Women desiring future pregnancies need to talk with health care provider aboutways to preser ve f ertility, such as preserving eggs for future use. \u0081Sexual difficulties \u0081Use water or mineral-based lubricant if experiencing vaginal dryness. \u0081Vaginal stenosis \u0081Discuss use of vaginal dilators with health care provider. \u0081Skin care \u0081Gently wash area; do not rub, scrub, or scratch. \u0081Avoid heat and cold. \u0081Wash in lukewarm water. \u0081Do not use heating pads or ice packs. \u0081Wear soft and loose-fitting cloths around treatment area. \u0081Protect skin from sun. \u0081Drink 6-8 cups of f luid per day . \u0081Avoid coffee, black tea, alcohol, and spices. \u0081Report changes to health care provider. \u0081May require antibiotic therapy. TABLE 19-6 MANAGEMENT OF CHEMOTHERAPY SIDE EFFECTS ANEMIA APPETITE CHANGES BLEEDING PROBLEMS\u0081Eat high-protein foods such as meat, peanut butter, and eggs. \u0081Eat foods high in iron, such as red meats, leafy greens, and cooked dried beans. \u0081Eat five or six small meals per day. \u0081Try new food to keep up interest in foods. \u0081Eat with friends and family. \u0081Eat with plastic forks and spoons and use glass pots if food tastes like metal. \u0081Drink milkshakes or eat soup because these are easier to swallow. \u0081Use electric shaver instead of a razor. \u0081Wear shoes all the time (except when sleeping). \u0081Brush teeth with soft toothbrush. \u0081Avoid being constipated.3704_Ch19_503-538 16/09/13 10:22 AM Page 528CHAPTER 19 Alterations in Women's Health 529 and not a diagnostic test. A cervical conization is done fordefinitive diagnosis. Most women who are diagnosed with cervical cancerhave not had regular Pap tests or have not followed up on abnormal results. Cervical cancer is typically slow growing and begins withdysplasia, a precancerous condition.Dysplasia is 100% treatable and may resolve on its own. Undetected or untreated precancerous changes candevelop into cervical cancer and spread to the bladder,intestines, lungs, and liver. Risk Factors HPV infection (most important risk factor) Early onset of sexual activity (before 16 years) Cigarette smoking STI Inadequate cervical screening Multiple sex partners In utero exposure to DES Use of birth control pills for 5 or more years Given birth to three or more children Risk Reduction See Chapter 18. Signs and Symptoms Early cervical cancer usually does not produce symptoms. Signsand symptoms that may indicate early cervical cancer are:Continuous vaginal discharge that may be watery, pink,brown, bloody, or foul smelling Abnormal vaginal bleeding between periods, after inter-course, or after menopause Menstrual period that becomes heavier and lasts longer Sign and Symptoms of Advanced Cervical Cancer: Loss of appetite Loss of weight Fatigue Pelvic, back, and/or leg pain Leaking of urine or feces from vaginaMedical Management Cervical cone biopsy to establish diagnosis Additional testing to determine if cancer is confined tothe cervix or if it has spread to other organs:Computed tomography (CT) scan Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Positron (PET) scan Intravenous pyelography (IVP) Chest x-ray Cystoscopy Blood studies Staging of cervical cancer (Table 19-7) Treatment depends on stage of cancer and the woman'sdesire for pregnancy (Table 19-7). Chemotherapy is used for cervical cancer that has eithermetastasized or recurred. Target drug therapyDrugs that have an effect on cancer cells while havinglittle effect on healthy cells They block the growth of cancer cells by preventing thecancer cells from dividing or by distorting them. Avastin (beracizumab) is one such drug that is given incombination with chemotherapy drugs. Nursing Actions Patient education and support are critical nursing actions forwomen with cervical cancer.Provide emotional support to the woman and her family. Provide information on nutrition that promotes healing. Explain the importance of rest and sleep in the promo-tion of healing. Provide information on community support services. Care for women undergoing surgical treatment:Address the woman's and family's questions regarding surgical procedure. Provide preoperative and postoperative care.

Instruct the woman to check with health care providerregarding types of lotions and creams to use. Instruct the woman to avoid the use of adhesive tape onthe treatment area. Recommend exposing the treatment area to air wheneverpossible to promote skin integrity. Care for woman undergoing chemotherapy:Administer chemotherapy as per orders. Provide information on the management of side effectsrelated to chemotherapy (Table 19-6).Endometrial Cancer Endometrial cancer is cancer that forms in the tissue lining of the uterus. It is the fourth leading cause of cancer-relateddeath in women (Eheman et al., 2012). Diagnosis is estab-lished by histologic examination of endometrial tissue. Risk Factors Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT): Unopposedestrogen therapy in women with a uterus. This cancause endometrial hyperplasia, an increased number ofcells in the lining of the uterus. Menopause after age 52 Obesity: Obesity affects the synthesis and metabolism ofsex hormones and insulin. Obese women tend to havehigher levels of estrogen related to the body making addi-tional estrogen in fatty tissue.

INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE Intimate partner violence (IPV), also called domestic violence,is physical, sexual, and/or psychological harm by a current orformer intimate partner or casual dating partner (see CriticalComponent: Signs of Intimate Partner Violence).IPV is a complex health and social issue affecting womenaround the world (Magnussen et al., 2011).Provide preoperative and postoperative care. Administer chemotherapy as per orders. Provide information on management of side effects fromradiation and/or chemotherapy as it applies to the woman(Tables 19-5 and 19-6). Ovarian Epithelial Cancer Ovarian epithelial tumor is the most common type of ovarian cancer and the third leading cause of cancer relateddeaths in women (Eheman et al., 2012). Symptoms of ovarian cancer are often vague, making it difficult to diagnose the disease during early stages. Diagnosis is estab-lished by histologic examination of the tumor usually attime of surgery. Risk Factors Family history of a first-degree relative with the disease;the most important risk factor (Lentz, 2012) Personal history of cancer Age over 55 Eastern European Jewish background Never given birth Have endometriosis Tested positive for BRCA1 or BRCA2 Signs and Symptoms Early stages are often asymptomatic or the woman willhave vague abdominal, genitourinary, or reproductivesymptoms (see Critical Component: Ovarian CancerSymptom Diary):Pressure or pain in the abdomen, pelvis, back, or leg Swollen or bloated abdomen Urinary urgency and frequency Difficulty eating or feeling full quickly (Cesario, 2010) CRITICAL COMPONENT Ovarian Cancer Symptom Diary The four most common occurring early warning signs of ovarian cancer are: Bloating Pelvic/abdominal pain Difculty eating or feeling full quickly Urinary symptoms To assist in early detection of ovarian cancer, women may be asked to keep a log of their symptoms for one month. They areinstructed to record when they experienced any of the fourcommon symptoms. They record the day of the week and thespecific symptom. Women who experience any of these symptoms more than 12 times in one month and these symptoms first appeared with-in the past 12 months should be evaluated for possible ovariancancer (Cesario, 2010). An example of the log is located atwww.ovarian.org.uk3704_Ch19_503-538 16/09/13 10:22 AM Page 532CHAPTER 19 Alterations in Women's Health 533 Approximately 1.3 million women per year are physicallyassaulted by an intimate partner (National Institute ofJustice [NIJ], 2007). IPV occurs across all socioeconomic, religious, and ethnicgroups. Approximately 50% of children living in homes of IPVare also abused. IPV is associated with 40%-50% of all murdered women(NIJ, 2007). IPV during pregnancy is associated with increased inci-dence of low-birth-weight infants, preterm birth, andneonatal death. Physical violence includes, but is not limited to, slapping,shaking, choking, burning, and use of weapons. Sexual violence includes, but is not limited to, forcing apartner to engage in sexual activity against her will; trad-ing sex for food, money, or drugs. Psychological/emotional violence includes, but is not limited to, humiliating the woman, controlling what thewoman can and cannot do, isolating the woman fromfamily and friends, and denying access to money.Nursing Actions The American Nurses Association (ANA) advocates for:Universal screening: All patients are screened for IPV. Routine assessment: A detailed assessment when screeningsuggests that the woman is at risk for abuse. Documentation of abuse: Documentation is essential forproviding a record of abuse and facilitating communica-tion among health professionals. Reporting IPV: Nurses need to be aware of laws regardingmandatory reporting. California, Colorado, Kentucky,New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Rhode Island havelaws that require reporting of IPV. Common questions asked in an IPV screening tool are:Has your partner ever hit you? Do arguments with your partner result in you feeling badabout yourself? Do you ever feel frightened by what your partner says or does? Do you feel safe in your current relationship? When a woman discloses IPV, the nurse should assess todetermine urgent safety needs and assist with developingplan of care. Provide information regarding IPV and safe shelters. Assist the woman in developing strategies to protect herself from harm. CRITICAL COMPONENT Signs of Intimate Partner Violence Repeated nonspecic complaints Overuse of health care system Hesitancy, embarrassment, or evasiveness in relating historyof injury Time lag between injury and presentation for care Untreated serious injuries Overly solicitous partner who stays close to the woman andattempts to answer questions directed at her Injuries of head, neck, face, and areas covered by a one-piecebathing suit; during pregnancy, the breasts and abdomen areparticular targets of assault Presence of bruises at various stages of healing (Krieger, 2008)3704_Ch19_503-538 16/09/13 10:22 AM Page 533UNIT 6 Women's Health 534 Problem No. 1: Risk for infertility Goal: Increased knowledge regarding relationship of PCOS and infertility Outcome: The woman verbalizes causes of infertility and methods to improve fertility.

Detailed clinical practice guidelines, referenced rationales and evidence ratings are included in the Guideline. Evidence supporting the benefits of breastfeeding, critical messages, responsibilities and key assessment and teaching points summarized herein are presented in the Guideline. BENEFITS OF BREASTFEEDINGFor infants: \u0081 Natural source of nutrients necessary for optimal growth and development during the first 6 months \u0081 Decreased incidence or severity of infections such as GI and respiratory infections, otitis media, necrotizing enterocolitis, gastroenteritis, meningitis and urinary tract infections \u0081 P protective effect against sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) \u0081 Potential protective effect against childhood and adult-onset diseases such as insulin-dependent diabetes, allergies, asthma, lymphoma, ulcerative colitis, and adult-onset hypertension\u0081 Less gastric reflux and constipation than formula feeding \u0081 P otential for enhanced cognitive development Discussions with women who are considering or are undecided about breastfeeding should include description of the following benefits: For women:\u0081 Enhanced uterine involution resulting in less postpartum blood loss and reduced risk of infection \u0081 Delayed resumption of ovulation that may facilitate family planning \u0081 Association between earlier return to pre-pregnancy weight compared with women who do not breastfeed \u0081 Red uced risk of osteoporosis, ovarian cancer and premenopausal breast cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis \u0081 Enhanced mother-infant attachment, maternal role attainment and self-esteem Breastfeeding is less expensive than formula feeding and can contribute to significant health care cost savings. CRITICAL MESSAGES TO SHARE WITH WOMEN AND THEIR PARTNERS RESPONSIBILITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES\u0081 Breastfeeding is the optimal method of infant feeding. \u0081 Most women can breastfeed successfully when they are given consistent information and support.\u0081 Breastfeeding can be sustained upon return to work or school.\u0081 Ideally, infants should breastfeed exclusively for the first year of life, i.e., during the first 6 months, the infant receives only breast milk; d uring the second 6 months, as other foods are introduced, the only source of milk given to the infant is breast milk. \u0081 Deliberate integration of breastfeeding information into academic and professional education programs will help ensure that health care professionals gain the knowledge needed to promote and support breastfeeding.\u0081 Nurses working with breastfeeding women should maintain current, evidence- based knowledge of breastfeeding practice and can be instrumental in initiating or participating in lactation research.\u0081 Breastfeeding support programs should be culturally sensitive and age- and community-appropriate. \u0081 Nurses and other health care professionals should relay consistent, supportiv e messages about breastfeeding. \u0081 Nurses can be instrumental in promoting breastfeeding as our cultural norm by supporting legislation that promotes breastfeeding and educating society about the benefits of breastfeeding.\u00a9 2007 Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses.

Address concerns or ambiv alence.\u0081 Educate women about maternal and neonatal benefits of breastfeeding.\u0081 Previous breastfeeding experiences , positiv e or negative, influence choice of f eeding method. Some f actors , such as perceived insufficient milk supply, can be addressed b y education and support that contin ue throughout pregnancy and the early postpart um period.\u0081 Suggest that return to work or school does not mean that the woman m ust stop breastfeeding. Benefits contin ue as long as the inf ant is breastf eeding, even when the inf a nt is being parti ally breastfed.\u0081 Discuss comm unity resources that are a vailab le to the woman such as support groups , lactation consultants and La Leche League.\u0081 Explain that f amily, friends and health care providers (including peer counselors) can help a wo m a n meet her breastfeeding goals .\u0081 Instr uct parents how to correctly ant at breast.\u0081 F acilitate uninterr upted skin-to-skin contact at birth and during hospitalization. Ideally, the first feeding should occur within 1 hour of birth if mother and inf ant are stab le.\u0081 Instr uct mother how to identify a correct latch: inf ant's nose , cheeks and chin should touch the breast. The woman should feel tugging, not pinching or pain, when the inf ant suck s. The inf ant is usually held tummy-to-tummy with the mother, and the mother positions her fingers to ensure the lactiferous sin uses are not b locked.\u0081 Teach parents that inf ant ma y be sleepy for the first 24 hours . Try to w ake the inf ant every 2-3 hours for feeding. Assure them that w a king and feeding the inf ant should get progressively easier throughout the first 24 hours .\u0081 Teach parents about inf ant states and help parents identify how their inf ant tr ansitions between states .\u0081 Teach early inf ant feeding cues: rooting, hand-to-mouth movements , sucking movement and sounds , mouth opening in response to tactile stim ulation and quietly aler t state. Crying is a late feeding cue.\u0081 Educate parents that inf ant should ha ve at least one stool and one void in the first 24 hours , three or more voids and one to two stools per da y b y da y 3 and six or more voids and three or more stools per da y b y da y 4. Other signs include light colored urine , audib le s wallows and appropriate weight gain; a maternal sign of adequate intake i s full breasts at the start of a feeding that become soft b y the end.\u0081 Explain that many physical char acteristics do not preclude breastfeeding. Share interventions to address indentified prob lem(s). F or example, inf ants are often ab le to gr asp and pull out inverted nipples during early feedings at the breast.\u0081 Some women who ha ve h ad previous breast surgery are ab le to exclusively breastfeed their inf ants . Regardless of the amount of breast milk received b y the inf ant, both mother and inf ant benefit.\u0081 Contin ue targeted, cultur ally appropri ate education throughout pregnancy. Culture and beliefs can positively or negatively influence the woman's decision to initiate or contin ue breastfeeding.3704_Appendices_541-550 16/09/13 Guide to Breastfeeding 544 \u00a9 2007 Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses.
