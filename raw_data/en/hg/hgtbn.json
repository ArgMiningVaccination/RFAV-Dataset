Summaries Of The News: [ Oklahoma Court Loosens Abortion Ban To Allow Saving A Woman's Life ](https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/oklahoma-court-loosens-abortion-ban-to-allow-saving-a-womans-life/) The state Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that a physician can terminate a pregnancy if they have determined \"to a reasonable degree of medical certainty\" that the pregnant person's life is in danger. \"Absolute certainty\" isn't required, but \"mere possibility\" isn't enough. [ The Washington Post: Oklahoma Must Allow Abortion If Mother's Life Is Threatened, Court Rules ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/03/22/oklahoma-abortion-supreme-court-ruling/) The Oklahoma Supreme Court overturned part of the state's near-total abortion ban, ruling in a 5-to-4 decision that the procedure would be lawful if there is a reasonable chance that a pregnancy could threaten a pregnant person's life. Oklahoma's constitution protects the right to an abortion if \"the woman's physician has determined to a reasonable degree of medical certainty\" that continuing \"the pregnancy will endanger the woman's life,\" the court's justices said in Tuesday's ruling. \"Absolute certainty\" that the pregnancy will be life-threatening isn't required, but \"mere possibility or speculation\" is insufficient, they added. (Jeong, 3/22) [ Slate: Another Red-State Supreme Court Finds a Constitutional Right to Lifesaving Abortions ](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/03/oklahoma-supreme-court-lifesaving-abortions.html) The scope of this standard is not entirely clear, but it suggests that a patient can undergo an abortion if the doctor determines there will be a threat to her life at some future point \"during the pregnancy.\" This standard is different from that in Texas, where doctors are waiting until pregnant patients are on death's door rather than terminating when conditions emerge that could be fatal later in the pregnancy. As the majority noted, \"absolute certainty\" that the condition would kill a patient if untreated \"is not required,\" though \"mere possibility or speculation is insufficient.\" In a long concurrence, Justice Yvonne Kauger, joined by Justices James Edmondson and Doug Combs, tried to clarify the new rule. A physician, she wrote, need not \"wait until their patient has a seizure, a stroke, experiences multiple organ failure, goes septic, or goes into a coma\" before terminating a dangerous pregnancy. The reasonable likelihood of life-threatening conditions justifies an immediate abortion.

The bill (SB 300) cleared the Senate's Republican-controlled Committee on Health Policy while several amendments brought by the panel's three Democratic members failed. Under proposal, moving to a six-week limit would be contingent on the Florida Supreme Court effectively upholding the 15-week law. A decision may not come until the legislative session ends in May.

The state's senior U.S. senator said the company's government affairs and legal teams informed her staff on Friday that Nevada is one of 29 states where it will not supply pharmacies with the Mifeprex, the brand name of the FDA-approved abortion drug mifepristone. The company will, however, continue to supply the drug directly to physicians. (Ollstein, 3/21) [ The Guardian: She Was One Of Alabama's Last Abortion Doctors.

As a proud, loud abortion provider who is well known on social media, she has made many enemies.

The findings were previewed last week, and the preprint report was released Monday night. [ The New York Times: Wuhan Market Samples Contained Covid and Animal Mixtures, Report Says ](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/21/science/covid-raccoon-dogs-wuhan-market.html) On Jan. 12, 2020, Chinese investigators combing a market for clues about the outbreak of a mysterious new illness in the city of Wuhan swabbed a cart. It was the kind typically used for transporting animal cages, and it came back positive for the coronavirus. Three years later, a team of international experts has sifted through the genetic contents of that swab, which were quietly uploaded to an international database and made public only this year. In a report released on Monday night, the scientists described in detail for the first time evidence from the swab that they say strengthens the case that illegally traded wild animals ignited the coronavirus pandemic. (Mueller, 3/21) [ The Guardian: Newly Released Chinese Covid Data Points To Infected Animals In Wuhan ](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/21/newly-released-chinese-covid-data-infected-animals-wuhan) What is significant about the new research is that it identifies high levels of DNA from several species that were not identified as having been tested during the original sampling. That includes racoon dogs, which it is speculated may have been present at the market before it was cleared early in the outbreak as part of the Chinese health authorities' immediate intervention. Although some of the material was leaked last week, the new report adds more detail about other animals present at the market, as well as showing that some of the Sars-CoV-2 positive environmental samples had more animal than human genetic material in them, which the researchers said was consistent with the animals being infected.

Chinese researchers had described their initial findings based on sequencing in a 2022 preprint but plan on publishing a fuller report in Nature. ... The earlier preprint from Chinese researchers suggested that the market may have amplified an already established epidemic. However, the international group said it found evidence of multiple animal species where positive SARS-CoV-2 environmental samples were found, including some that weren't included on an earlier list of live or dead animals tested at the market.

Within a day or so of nabbing the sequences off a database called GISAID, the researchers told me, they reached out to the Chinese scientists who had uploaded the data to share some preliminary results. The next day, public access to the sequences was locked\u2014according to GISAID, at the request of the Chinese researchers, who had previously analyzed the data and drawn distinctly different conclusions about what they contained.

They left quietly, one or two at a time, through the building's front doors, flashing their badges at guards, instead of through side exits where their departures would be recorded. Gathering in a small park across the street, they stood with their coffees in hand and agonized over some shocking developments.

China has long refused to use the foreign-made mRNA shots that were crucial in easing the pandemic in many parts of the world and that the United States first authorized for emergency use in December 2020. Beijing chose instead to promote its own pharmaceutical firms, first in rolling out a more traditional but less effective Covid vaccine, and later, in the pursuit of a homegrown mRNA, or messenger RNA, vaccine.

Co-funded by the National Institutes of Health, the study released Monday challenges older research that suggested a prior Covid infection enhanced a vaccinated individual's immune response \u2014 a phenomenon known as hybrid immunity, which some scientists believe provides the best protection against reinfection.

If successful, the proposal would leave little unaffected in the sprawling, multibillion-dollar network that sends kidneys, livers and other organs from deceased donors to severely ill recipients. That system has long been criticized as inadequate: Nearly 104,000 people are on waiting lists for organs, most of them kidneys; 22 people die each day awaiting transplants, with poor and minority patients generally faring worse than affluent and White people.

The shift was implemented in 2020 to prioritize the sickest patients on waitlists no matter where they live.
