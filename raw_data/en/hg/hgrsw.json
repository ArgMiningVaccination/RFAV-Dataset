Abstract Setting up a drug discovery and development program sin academic, non-profit and other life science re search companies require careful planning. This chapter contains guidelines to develop therapeutic hypothesis, target and pathway validation, proof of concept criteria and generalized cost analysis at various stages of early drug discovery. Various decision po ints in developing a New Chemical Entity (NCE), des cription of the exploratory IND and orphan drug designation, drug repurposing and drug delivery tec hnologies are also described geared toward those wh o intend to develop new drug discovery and development programs.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12345678910 11 Early Drug Discovery and Development Guidelines: Fo r Academic Researchers, Collaborat ors, ... http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92015/?report= printable 1 of 46 7/26/2013 11:44 PM 1.2.3.Background Medical innovation in America today calls for new m odels for collaborations that span government, acad emia, industry and disease philanthropy. Barriers t o translation and ultimate commercialization will be lowered by bringing best practices from industry in to academic settings, and by training not only a ne w generation of 'translational' scientists prepared t o move a therapeutic idea forward into proof of con cept in humans, but by developing a new cadre of investigators skilled in regulatory science. As universities begin to focus on commercializing r esearch, there is an evolving paradigm for drug dis covery and early development focused innovation wit hin the academic enterprise. The innovation process -- moving from basic research to invention and to comm ercialization and application -- will remain a comp lex and costly journey. New funding mechanisms, the imp ortance of collaborations within and among institut ions, the essential underpinnings of public-private partnerships that involve some or all sectors, the focus of the new field of regulatory science, and n ew appropriate bridges between federal health and regulatory agencies all come to bear in this endeav or. This guideline serves to assist academic investigat ors in advancing new therapies from the discovery p hase into early drug development, including evaluat ion of therapies in human and/or clinical proof of conc ept. It outlines necessary steps required to identi fy and properly validate drug targets, define the u tility of employing probes in the early discovery phase, medi cinal chemistry, lead optimization, and preclinical proof of concept strategies, as well as address dr ug delivery needs through preclinical proof of concept . Once a development candidate has been identified, the guideline provides an overview of human and/or clinical proof of concept enabling studies required by regulatory agencies prior to initiation of clin ical trials. To guide academic researchers, collaborators and st art-up companies through the drug discovery, lead o ptimization and early phases of regulated drug development, we have developed Drug Discovery and Early Development Guidelines. The guidelines also help to ensure quality project plans are developed and projects advanced consistently. These guidelines outline the expected intellectual prope rty required at key decision points and the process by which decisions may be taken to move a project forw ard. Purpose The purpose of this document is to define the three practical drug discovery and early development pat hs to advancing new cancer therapies to early stage clinical trials, including: Discovery and early development of novel, new compo unds (NCE) Discovery of new, beneficial activity currently mar keted drugs possess against novel cancer drug targe ts, also referred to as \"drug repurposing\" Application of novel platform technology to the dev elopment of improved delivery of currently marketed drugs Within each of the three strategies, Decision Point s must be identified along the commercial value cha in. To move forward in the development process, key data required at each Decision Point must be gather ed to meet the targets and expectations required to support further development. An estimate of the financial resources needed to generate the data at each Decision Point should also be determined as we ll as the opportunities available to outsource acti vities to optimally leverage strengths within the Institut ion. It is important to integrate these activities with the intellectual property management process P otential Decision Points which: Offer opportunities to initiate meaningful discussi ons with regulatory agencies to define requirements for advancement of new cancer therapies to human evaluation Afford opportunities to license technologies to uni versity start-up, biotechnology and major pharmaceu tical companies Define potential role(s) the National Institute of Health SBIR programs may play in advancing new canc er therapies along the drug discovery and early development path.Early Drug Discovery and Development Guidelines: Fo r Academic Researchers, Collaborat ors, ... http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92015/?report= printable of 46 7/26/2013 11:44 PM 1.2. 3. 4.5.6.7. 8.Scope The scope of drug discovery and early drug developm ent within the scope of these guidelines spans Targ et Identification through Human (Phase I) and/or Clinical (Phase IIa) Proof of Concept. This documen t describes an approach to Drug Discovery and Devel opment for Treatment, Prevention, and Control of Cancer. The Guidelines and Decision Points describe d herein may serve as the foundation for collaborat ive projects with other organizations in multiple therapeutic areas. Assumptions These guidelines are being written with Target Iden tification as the initial Decision Point although t he process outlined here applies to a project initi ated at any of the subsequent points. The final Decision Point referenced in this documen t is Human and/or Clinical Proof of Concept. Althou gh the process for New Drug Approval is well defined, it is very resource intensive and beyond t he focus of most government, academic, and disease philanthropy organizations conducting drug discovery and early drug development activities.The Decision Points in this document are specific t o development of a drug for the treatment of relaps ed or refractory late stage cancer patients. Many o f the same criteria apply to the development of drugs intended for other indications and therapeutic are as, but each disease should be approached with a logical customization of this plan. Development of compounds for the prevention and control of cancer would follow a more conservative pathway as the benefit/risk evaluation for these compounds would b e different. When considering prevention of a disea se one is typically treating patients at risk, but before the disease has developed in individuals tha t are otherwise healthy. The development criteria f or these types of compounds would be more rigorous initially and would typically include a full noncli nical development program to support the human stud ies. Similarly, compounds being developed to control cancer suggest that the patients may have a prolonged life expectation such that long term tox icity must be fully evaluated before exposing a lar ge patient population to the compound. The emphasis of the current document will focus on the development of compounds for the treatment of late stage cancer patients. The authors are planning a compani on document that will address the specific challeng es associated with the development of chemoprevention agents.Human and/or Clinical Proof of Concept strategies w ill differ dependent upon the intent of the product (treatment, prevention, or control). The concepts and strategies described in this document can be mo dified for the development of a drug for prevention or control of multiple diseaes. These Decision Points are specific to the developme nt of a small molecule drug. Development of large m olecules will require the evaluation of additional criteria and may be very specific to the nature of the molecule under development. This plan is written to describe the resources requ ired at each Decision Point and does not presume th at licensing will occur only at the final Decision Point. It is incumbent upon the stakeholders involv ed to decide the optimal point at which the technol ogy should move outside the University. The plan described here does not assume that the en tire infrastructure necessary to generate the data underlying each decision criterion is available at any single institution. The estimates of financial reso urce requirements are based on an assumption that t hese services can be purchased from an organization , (or funded through a collaborator) that has the nec essary equipment, instrumentation, and personnel to conduct the necessary studies. The costs associated with the tasks in the developm ent plan are based on the experiences of the author s. It is reasonable to assume that variability in t he costs and duration for specific data-generating act ivities will be dependent upon the nature of the ta rget and molecule under development. Definitions At Risk Initiation - The decision by the project team to begin activi ties that do not directly support the next unmet De cision Point, but will instead support a subsequent Decision Point. At Risk Initiation is sometimes recommended to decrease the overall d evelopment time.Early Drug Discovery and Development Guidelines: Fo r Academic Researchers, Collaborat ors, ... http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92015/?report= printable 3 of 46 7/26/2013 11:44 PM Commercialization Point - In this context, the authors use the term to des cribe the point at which a commercial entity is inv olved to participate in the development of the drug product. This most commonly occurs through a direct licensing arrangement betw een the University and an organization with the resources to continue the development of the produc t. Counter-screen - A screen performed in parallel with or after the primary screen. The assay used in the counter-scre en is developed to identify compounds that have the potential to interfere with the assay used in the primary screen (the primary assay). Co unter-screens can also be used to eliminate compoun ds that possess undesirable properties, for example, a counter-screen for cytotoxicity. (1) Cumulative Cost - This describes the total expenditure by the proj ect team from project initiation to the point at wh ich the project is either completed or terminated. Decision Point - The latest moment at which a predetermined course of action is initiated. Project advancement based on decision points balances the need to conserve scarce development resources with the requirement to develop the technology to a comm ercialization point as quickly as possible. Failure to meet the criteria listed for the following Decision Points will lead to a No Go recommendation. False positive - Generally related to the ''specificity'' of an a ssay. In screening, a compound may be active in an assay but inactive toward the biological target of interest. For this Review, this does not include activity due to spurious, non-reproducible activity (such as lint in a sample that causes ligh t-scatter or fluorescence). Compound interference that is reprod ucible is a common cause of false positives, or tar get-independent activity. (1) Go Decision - The project conforms to key specifications and c riteria and will continue. High-Throughput Screen (HTS) - A large-scale experiment in which collections of compounds are tested for activity against a biolog ical target or pathway. \"Screen\" for short. (1) Hits - Slang for putative activity observed during the primary high-throughput screen, usually defined by percent activity relative to control compounds. (1) Incremental Cost - A term used to describe the additional cost of a ctivities that support decision criteria for any gi ven Decision Point, independent of other activities that may have been completed or initiate d to support decision criteria for any other decisi on point. Library - A collection of compounds. (1) New Chemical Entity (NCE) - A molecule emerging from the discovery process tha t has not previously been evaluated in clinical tri als. No Go Decision - The project does not conform to key specificatio ns and criteria and will not continue. Off-Target Activity - Compound activity that is not directed toward th e biological target of interest but can give a posi tive read-out, and thus can be classified as an active in the assay. (1) Orthagonal Assay - An assay performed following (or in parallel to) the primary assay to differentiate between compoun ds that generate false positives from those compounds that are genuinely active agai nst the target. (1) Primary Assay - The assay used for the high-throughput screen. ( 1) Qualified Task - A task that should be considered, but not necess arily required to be completed at a suggested point in the project plan. The decision is usually guided by factors outside the scope of this document. Such tasks will be denoted in this docum ent by enclosing the name of the tasks in parenthes es in the Gantt Chart, e.g. (qualified task). Secondary Assay - An assay used to test the activity of compounds found active in the primary screen (and orthogonal assay) using robust assays of relevant biology. Ideally, these are of at least me dium-throughput to allow establishment of structure -activity relationships between the primary and secondary assays and establish a biologically plaus ible mechanism of action. (1) 1Early Drug Discovery and Development Guidelines: Fo r Academic Researchers, Collaborat ors, ... http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92015/?report= printable 4 of 46 7/26/2013 11:44 PM Section 1 Discovery and Development of New Chemical Entities (NCE) The Gantt chart below illustrates the scope of this document ( Figure 1). The left-hand portion of the chart inclu des the name of each Decision Point as well as the incremental cost for the activities that suppor t that task. The black bars on the right-hand porti on of the figure represent the duration of the summ ary task (combined criteria) to support a Decision Point as well as the cumulative cost for the project at the completion of that activity . A similar layout applies to each of the subsequent figures; however the intent of th ese figures is to articulate the activities that un derlie each Decision Point. The submission of regulatory documents, for the pur pose of this example, reflects the preparation of a n Investigational New Drug (IND) application in Common Technical Document (CTD) format. The CTD for mat is required for preparation of regulatory docum ents in Europe (according to the Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier [IMPD]), Canada for inves tigational applications (Clinical Trial Application ) and is accepted by the United States Food and Dru g Administration (FDA) for INDs. The CTD format is re quired for electronic CTD (eCTD) submissions. The a dvantages of the CTD are that it facilitates global harmonization and lays the foundation upon which th e marketing application can be prepared. The sectio ns of the CTD are prepared early in development (at the IND stage) and then are updated, as needed, unt il submission of the marketing application. Decision Point #1 - Target Identification Target-based drug discovery begins with identifying the function of a possible therapeutic target and its role in the disease (2). There are two criteria that justify advancement of a project beyond Target Iden tification. These are: Previously published (peer-reviewed) data on a part icular disease target pathway or target, OR Evidence of new biology that modulates a disease pa thway or target Resource requirements to support this initial stage of drug discovery can vary widely as the novelty o f the target increases. In general, the effort requ ired to elucidate new biology can be significant. Most proj ects will begin with these data in hand, whether fr om new or existing biology. We estimate that an add itional $100,000 may be invested to support the Target Iden tification data that may already exist ( Figure 2). However, as reflected in Figure 1, if Target Validation activities proceed at risk, the total cost of the p roject at a \"No Go\" decision will reach $190,000 (e stimated). Decision Point #2 - Target Validation Target Validation requires a demonstration that a m olecular target is directly involved in a disease p rocess, and that modulation of the target is likely to have a therapeutic effect (2). There are seven criteria fo r evaluation prior to advancement beyond Target Val idation. These are: Known molecules modulate target Type of target has a history of success (e.g. Ion c hannel, GCPR, nuclear receptor, transcription facto r, cell cycle, enzyme, etc.) Genetic confirmation (e.g. Knock-out, siRNA, shRNA, SNP, known mutations, etc.) Availability of known animal models Low-throughput target validation assay that represe nts biology Intellectual property of the target Determine marketability of the target The advancement criteria supporting Target Validati on can usually be completed in approximately 12 mon ths by performing most activities in parallel. In a n effort to reduce the overall development timeline, we recommend starting Target Validation activities at risk (prior to a Go decision on Target Identific ation). Figure 2 illustrates the dependencies between the c riteria supporting the first two decision points. T he incremental cost of the activities supporting de cision- Early Drug Discovery and Development Guidelines: Fo r Academic Researchers, Collaborat ors, ... http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92015/?report= printable 5 of 46 7/26/2013 11:44 making criteria for Target Validation is approximat ely $162,000. However, a decision to initiate Targe t Validation prior to completion of Target Initiati on (recommended) and subsequent initiation of Identifi cation of Actives at risk would lead to a total pro ject cost (estimate) of $380,000 if a No Go decisio n were reached at the conclusion of Target Validation. Decision Point #3 - Identification of Actives An Active is defined as a molecule that shows signi ficant biological activity in a validated screening assay. By satisfying the advancement criteria list ed below for Identification of Actives, the project team wil l begin to define new composition of matter by link ing a chemical structure to modulation of the targe t. There are five (or six if invention disclosure occurs at this stage) criteria for evaluation at the Identifi cation of Actives decision point. These are: Acquisition of screening reagents Primary HTS assay development and validation Compound library available to screen Actives criteria defined Perform high-throughput screen (Composition of Matter invention disclosure) The advancement criteria supporting Identification of Actives can be completed in approximately 12 mon ths in most cases by performing activities in paral lel. Figure 3 illustrates the dependencies and timing as sociated with a decision to begin activities suppor ting Identification of Actives prior to a Go decisi on on Decision Point #3. The incremental cost associated with Decision Point #3 is estimated to be $232,000 (assuming the assay is transferred and validated without difficulty). The accumulated project cost a ssociated with a No Go decision at this point is es timated to be $640,000. This assumes an at risk initiation of activities supporting Decision Point #4. Decision Point #4 - Confirmation of Hits A Hit is defined as consistent activity of a molecu le (with confirmed purity and identity) in a bioche mical and/or cell based secondary assay. Additional ly, this is the point at which the project team will make an assessment of the molecular class of each of the H its. There are six (or seven if initial invention d isclosure occurs at this stage) criteria for evaluation at th e Confirmation of Hits decision point. These are: Confirmation based on repeat assay, concentration r esponse curve (CRC) Secondary assays for specificity, selectivity, and mechanisms Confirmed identity and purity Cell-based assay confirmation of biochemical assay when appropriate Drugability of chemical class (reactivity, stabilit y, synthetic feasibility, solubility) Chemical Intellectual Property (IP) (Composition of Matter invention disclosure) The advancement criteria supporting Decision Point #4 can usually be completed in approximately 18 mon ths depending upon the existence of cell-based assays for confirmation. If the assays need to be d eveloped or validated at the Screening Lab, we reco mmend starting that activity at risk concurrent wit h the CRC and mechanistic assays. Figure 4 represents the dependencies and timing ass ociated with the decision to begin activities suppo rting Confirmation of Hits Early Drug Discovery and Development Guidelines: Fo r Academic Researchers, Collaborat ors, ... http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92015/?report= printable 6 of 46 7/26/2013 11:44 PM prior to a Go decision on Decision Point #3. The in cremental cost of Confirmation of Hits is $291,000. The accumulated project cost at a No Go decision o n Decision Point #4 can be as high as $855,000 if a p roceed at risk decision is made on Identification o f a Chemical Lead (DP#5). Decision Point #5 - Identification of Chemical Lead A Chemical Lead is defined as a synthetically feasi ble, stable, and drug-like molecule active in prima ry and secondary assays with acceptable specificity and selectivity for the target. This requires definition of the St ructure-Activity Relationship (SAR) as well as dete rmination of synthetic feasibility and preliminary evidence of in vivo efficacy. (Note: projects at this stage may be eligible for P hase I SBIR). Characteristics of a chemical lead are: SAR defined Drugability (preliminary toxicity, hERG, Ames) Synthetic feasibility Select mechanistic assays In vitro assessment of drug resistance and efflux potential Evidence of in vivo efficacy of chemical class PK/Toxicity of chemical class known based on prelim inary toxicity or in-silico studies. In order to decrease the number of compounds that f ail in the drug development process, a drugability assessment is often conducted. This assessment is important in transforming a compound from a lead mo lecule into a drug. For a compound to be considered drugable it should have the potential to bind to a specific receptor; however, also important is the c ompound's pharmacokinetic profile regarding absorpt ion, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Other assays will evaluate the potential toxicity of the compound in screens such as the Ames test and cytot oxicity assay. When compounds are being developed f or indications where the predicted patient survival is limited to a few years, it is important to note th at a positive result in the cytotoxicity assays wou ld not necessarily limit the development of the compound a nd other drugability factors (such as the pharmacok inetic profile) would be more relevant for determin ing the potential for development.The advancement criteria supporting Decision Point #5 will most likely be completed in approximately 1 2-18 months due to the concurrent activities. We recommend that SAR and drugability assessments begi n at risk prior to a Go on Confirmation of Hits. Synthetic Feasibility and PK assessment will begin at the completion of the previous Decision Point (#4). The cost of performing the recommended activities to s upport Identification of a Chemical Lead is estimat ed to be $243,500 ( Figure 5). The accumulated project costs at the com pletion of Decision Point #5 are estimated to be $1 ,110,000 including costs associated with at risk initiation of activities to support De cision Point #6. Decision Point #6 - Selection of Optimized Chemical Lead An Optimized Chemical Lead is a molecule that will enter IND-enabling GLP studies and GMP supplies wil l be produced for clinical trials. We will describe the activities that support GLP and GMP development in the next section. This section focuses on the Decis ion process to identify those molecules. ( Note: projects at this stage may be eligible for Phase II SBIR). Criteria for selecting optimized candidates are li sted below : Acceptable in vivo PK and toxicity Feasible formulation In vivo preclinical efficacy (properly powered) Dose range finding pilot toxicology (DRF) Early Drug Discovery and Development Guidelines: Fo r Academic Researchers, Collaborat ors, ... http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92015/?report= printable 7 of 46 7/26/2013 11:44 PM Process chemistry assessment of scale up feasibilit y The advancement criteria supporting Decision Point #6 can be completed in approximately 12 months. As indicated above, we recommend commencing activities to support Selection of an Optimized Che mical Lead prior to a \"Go\" decision on Decision Poi nt #5. In particular, the project team should place emphasis on 6.3 ( in vivo preclinical efficacy). A strong lead will have cle arly defined pharmacodynamic endpoints at the precl inical stage and will set the stage for strong indicators of efficacy at Decision Point #11 (Clinical Proof-of-Concept). The cost of perfo rming the recommended activities to support Decisio n Point #6 is estimated to be $195,000 ( Figure 6). The accumulated project costs at the com pletion of Decision Point #5 are estimated to be $1 .3 million including costs associated with at risk initiation of activities to support Decision Point #7. Decision Point #7 - Selection of a Development Cand idate A Development Candidate is a molecule for which the intent is to begin Phase I evaluation. Prior to su bmission of an IND, the project team must evaluate the likelihood of successfully completing the IND-enabl ing work that will be required as part of the regul atory application for first in human testing. Prior to Decision Point #7, many projects will advance as ma ny as 7-10 molecules. Typically, most pharma and bi otech companies will select a single development candidate with one designated backup. Here, we reco mmend that the anointed \"Development Candidate\" be the molecule that rates the best on the five criteria below. A failure to address all of these b y any molecule should warrant a \"No Go\" decision by the project team. The following criteria should be minimally met for a development candidate: Acceptable PK (with a validated bioanalytical metho d) Demonstrated in vivo efficacy/activity Acceptable safety margin (toxicity in rodents or do gs when appropriate) Feasibility of GMP manufacture Acceptable drug interaction profile The advancement criteria supporting Decision Point #7 are estimated to be completed in 12 months, but may be compressed to as little as 6 months. The primary rate limiter among the decision criteria is the determination of the safety margin as this can be affected by the formulation and dosing strategi es selected earlier. In this case the authors have pre sented a project that includes a 7-day repeat dose in rodents to demonstrate acceptable safety margin. If the development plan requires a longer toxicology study at this point, costs can be two-fold (approximatel y $190,000 for a 14-day repeat dose study in rats a nd $225,00 in dogs). The incremental costs of the acti vities to support Selection of a Development Candid ate (as shown) are estimated to be approximately $230,000. The accumulated project cost at this poin t is approximately $1.65 million ( Figure 7). Decision Point #8 - Pre-IND Meeting with FDA Pre-IND advice from FDA may be requested for issues related to data needed to support the rationale fo r testing a drug in humans; the design of nonclinic al pharmacology, toxicology, and drug activity studies , including design and potential uses of any propos ed treatment studies in animal models; data requirements for an Investigational New Drug (IND) application; initial drug development plans, and re gulatory requirements for demonstrating safety and efficacy (1). We recommend that this meeting take p lace after the initiation, but before the completio n of tasks to support Decision Point 7 (Selection o f a Development Candidate). The feedback from FDA may n ecessitate adjustments to the project plan. Making these changes prior to Candidate Selection will save time and money. Pre-IND preparation will requi re the following: Prepare pre-IND meeting request to FDA, including s pecific questions Prepare pre-IND meeting package, which includes ade quate information for FDA to address the specific q uestions Prepare the team for the pre-IND meeting Early Drug Discovery and Development Guidelines: Fo r Academic Researchers, Collaborat ors, ... http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92015/?report= printable 8 of 46 7/26/2013 11:44 PM Conduct Pre-IND meeting with FDA Adjust project plan to address FDA comments The advancement criteria supporting Decision Point #8 should be completed in 6 months. We recommend pr eparing the pre-IND meeting request approximately 3 to 6 months prior to Selection of a Development Candidate (provided that the data supp orting that Decision Point are promising). The cost of performing the recommended activities to support De cision Point #8 is estimated to be $37,000. The acc umulated project costs at the completion of Decisio n Point #5 are estimated to be $1.65 million includin g costs associated with at risk initiation of activities to support Decision Point #9. Decision Point #9 - Preparation and Submission of a n IND Application The decision to submit an IND Application presuppos es that all of the components of the application ha ve been addressed. The largest expense associated with preparation of the IND is related to the CMC a ctivities (manufacture and release of GMP clinical supplies). A \"Go\" decision is contingent upon all o f the requirements for the IND having been addressed and that the regulatory agency agrees with the clinical plan. (Note: projects at this stage may be eligibl e for SBIR BRIDGE Awards): The following criteria should be addressed, in addition to addressing comments fr om the Pre-IND meeting: Acceptable clinical dosage form Acceptable preclinical drug safety profile Clear IND regulatory path Human Proof of Concept(HPOC)/Clinical Proof of Conc ept (CPOC) plan is acceptable to regulatory agency (Pre-IND meeting) The advancement criteria supporting Decision Point #9 are estimated to be completed in 12 months, but may be compressed to as little as 6 months if necessary. We recommend initiating \"at risk\" as lon g as there is confidence that a qualified developme nt candidate is emerging before completion of DP #7 and the plan remains largely unaltered after the pre-IN D meeting (Decision Point #8). The incremental cost s of completing DP #9 are estimated to be $305,000. The accumulated Project Cost at this point will be approximately $1.8 million ( Figure 8). Decision Point #10 - Human Proof of Concept Most successful Phase I trials in oncology require 12-18 months for completion due to very restrictive enrollment criteria in these studies, in some case s. There is no \"at risk\" initiation of Phase I; therefore, t he timeline cannot be shortened in that manner. The most important factors in determining the length o f a Phase I study are a logically written clinical prot ocol and an available patient population. A \"Go\" de cision clearly rests on the safety of the drug, but many project teams will decide not to proceed if there i s not at least some preliminary indication of effic acy during Phase I (DP #10d below). Proceeding to P hase I trials will depend on: IND clearance Acceptable maximum tolerated dose (MTD) Acceptable dose response (DR) Evidence of human pharmacology Healthy volunteer relevance We estimate the incremental cost of an oncology Pha se I study will be approximately $620,000. This can increase significantly if additional patients are required to demonstrate MTD, DR, pharmacology and/o r efficacy. Our estimate is based on a 25 patient ( outpatient) study completed in 18 months. The accumulated project cost at completion of DP #10 wi ll be approximately $2.45 million (Figures 9 and 10).Early Drug Discovery and Development Guidelines: Fo r Academic Researchers, Collaborat ors, ... http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92015/?report= printable 9 of 46 7/26/2013 11:44 PM Decision Point #11: Clinical Proof of Concept With acceptable Dose Response and Maximum Tolerated Dose having been defined during Phase I, in Phase II the project team will attempt to statistically demonstrate efficacy. More specifically, the outcom e of Phase II should reliably predict the likelihoo d of success in Phase III randomized trials. Meeting the IND objectives Acceptable human PK profile Evidence of human pharmacology Safety and tolerance assessments We estimate the incremental cost of an oncology Pha se IIa study will be approximately $1.5 million. Th is cost is largely dependent on the number of patie nts required and the number of centers involved. Our es timate is based on 150 outpatients with studies com pleted in 24 months. The accumulated project cost a t completion of DP #11 will be approximately $3.95 mi llion. Section 2 Repurposing of Marketed Drugs Drug repurposing and rediscovery development projec ts frequently seek to employ the 505(b)(2) drug dev elopment strategy. This strategy leverages studies conducted and data generated by the innovator firm which is available in the published literature, in product monographs, or product labeling. Improving the quality of drug development plans will reduce 505(b )(2) development cycles time, and reduce the time a nd effort required by the FDA during the NDA review process. Drug repurposing projects seek a new indic ation, in a different patient population, and perha ps a different formulated drug product, than what i s currently described in the product label. By levera ging existing nonclinical data and clinical safety experience, sponsors have the opportunity to design and execute novel, innovative clinical trials to charac terize safety and efficacy in a different patient p opulation. The decision points for drug repurposing are summarized in Figure 11. Decision Point 1: Identification of Actives For drug repurposing, actives are identified as fol lows ( Figure 12): Acquisition of compounds for screening Primary HTS assay development, validation Compound library available to screen Actives criteria defined Perform high-throughput screen Submit Invention Disclosure and consider Use patent Decision Point 2: Confirmation of Hits Hits are confirmed as follows for a drug repurposin g project ( Figure 13): Confirmation based on repeat assay, concentration r esponse curve (CRC) Secondary assays for specificity, selectivity and m echanisms Early Drug Discovery and Development Guidelines: Fo r Academic Researchers, Collaborat ors, ... confirmation of biochemical assay when appropriate (Submit Invention Disclosure and consider Use paten t) Decision Point 3: Gap Analysis/Development Plan When considering the 505(b)(2) NDA approach, it is important to understand what information is availab le to support the proposed indication and what additional information may be needed. The developme nt path is dependent upon the proposed indication, change in formulation, route, and dosing regimen. The gap analysis/development plan that is prepared will take this information into account in order to determine what studies may be needed prior to submission of an IND and initiating first-in-man st udies.

Of those that do make it into clinical t rials, about 9 out of 10 fail. Roughly 67% of that failure has been attributed to poor pharmacokinetic s, undesirable metabolic properties, and/or toxicity. These fundamental challenges to the enablement of i mportant, NCE-based therapies represent unfulfilled market potential for innovative drug delivery solut ions to address. Moreover, drug delivery technology can provide a \"second chance\" for promising compounds that have consumed precious drug-discover y resources but were abandoned in early clinical tr ials due to unfavorable side-effect profiles. As on e analyst observed, \"pharmaceutical companies are sit ting on abandoned goldmines that should be reopened and excavated again using the previously underutilized or unavailable picks and shovels deve loped by the drug delivery industry.\" (SW Warburg D illon Read) Although this statement was made more than 10 years ago, it continues to apply ( Figure 20). Beyond enablement of new drugs, innovative approach es to drug delivery also hold potential to enhance marketed drugs (e.g., through improvement in convenience, tolerability, safety, and/or efficacy) ; expand their use (e.g., through broader labeling in the same therapeutic area and/or increased patie nt acceptance/compliance); or transform them by enabli ng their suitability for use in other therapeutic a reas. These opportunities contribute enormously to the potential for value creation in the drug delivery f ield.

Clinical supplies release specification (Submit Invention Disclosure on novel formulation) See Figure 21 for a schematic representation of the tim e and costs associated with development at this sta ge. Decision Point #2: Development Plan Preparation of a development plan allows the sponso r to evaluate the available information regarding t he compound of interest (whether at the development stage or a previously marketed compound) to underst and what information may be available to support th e proposed indication and what additional information may be needed. The development path is dependent upon the proposed indication, change in f ormulation, route, and dosing regimen. The development plan that is prepared will take this in formation into account in order to determine what i nformation or additional studies may be needed prio r to submission of an IND and initiating first-in-man st udies.

More specifically, the outcom e of Phase II should reliably predict the likelihoo d of success in Phase III randomized trials ( Figure 27). IND Clearance Acceptable PK profile Efficacy Direct and indirect biomarkers Safety and tolerance assessments Section 4 Alternative NCE Strategy: Exploratory IND The plans described previously in this guideline de scribe advancement of novel drugs as well as repurp osed or reformulated, marketed drug products to human and/or clinical proof of concept trials using the traditional or conventional early drug develop ment, investigational new drug (IND) approach. This section of the guideline outlines an alternative ap proach to accelerating novel drugs and imaging mole cules to humans employing a Phase 0, exploratory IN D strategy (Exploratory IND). The Exploratory IND str ategy was first issued in the form of draft guidanc e in April, 2005. Following a great deal of feedbac k from the public and private sector, the final guidance w as published in January, 2006. Phase 0 describes clinical trials which occur very early in the Phase I stage of drug development. Pha se 0 trials limit drug exposure to humans (up to 7 days) and have no therapeutic intent. Phase 0 studies are viewed by the FDA and NCI as important tools to ac celerating novel drugs to the clinic. There is some flexibility in data requirements for an Exploratory IND. These requirements are dependent on the goals of the investigation (e.g., receptor occupancy, pharmacokinetics, human biomarker validation), the clinical testing approach, and anticipated risks. Exploratory IND studies provide the sponsor with an opportunity to evaluate up to five chemical entiti es (optimized chemical lead candidates) or formulat ions at once. When an optimized chemical lead candidate or formulation is selected, the Exploratory IND is then closed, and subsequent drug development proceeds along the traditional IND pathway. This ap proach allows one, when applicable, to characterize the human pharmacokinetics and target interaction of chemical lead candidates. Exploratory IND goals are typically to: Characterize the relationship between mechanism of action and treatment of the disease, in other words , to validate proposed drug targets in humans Characterize the human pharmacokinetics Select the most promising chemical lead candidate f rom a group of optimized chemical lead candidates ( note that the chemical lead candidates do not necessarily have the same chemical scaffold origins ) Explore the biodistribution of chemical lead candid ates employing imaging strategies (e.g., PET studie s) Exploratory IND studies are broadly described as \"m icrodosing\" studies and clinical studies attempting to demonstrate a pharmacologic effect. ExploratoryEarly Drug Discovery and Development Guidelines: Fo r Academic Researchers, Collaborat ors, ... http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92015/?report= printable 15 of 46 7/26/2013 11:44 PM IND or Phase 0 strategies must be discussed with th e relevant regulatory agency before implementation. These studies are described below. Microdosing studies are intended to characterize th e pharmacokinetics of chemical lead candidates or t he imaging of specific human drug targets. Microdos ing studies are not intended to produce a pharmacologic effect. Doses are limited to less than 1/100th of the dose predicted (based on preclinical data) to p roduce a pharmacologic effect in humans, or a dose of less than 100 mcg, whichever is less. Exploratory IND-e nabling preclinical safety requirements for microdo sing studies are substantially less than the conventiona l IND approach. In the US, a single dose, single sp ecies toxicity study employing the clinical route o f administration is required. Animals are observed fo r 14 days following administration of the single do se. Routine toxicology endpoints are collected. The objective of this toxicology study is to identify t he minimally toxic dose, or alternatively, demonstr ate a large margin of safety (e.g., 100x). Genotoxi city studies are not required. The EMEA, in contrast to the FDA, requires toxicology studies employing two routes o f administration, intravenous, and the clinical rou te prior to initiating microdosing studies. Genotoxici ty studies (bacterial mutation and micronucleus) ar e required. Exploratory IND workshops have discusse d or proposed allowance of up to five microdoses admi nistered to each subject participating in an Explor atory IND study, provided each dose does not exceed 1/100th the NOAEL or 1/100th of the anticipated pha rmacologically active dose, or the total dose admin istered is less than 100 mcg, whichever is less. In this case, doses would be separated by a washout period of at least six pharmacokinetic terminal half-lives . Fourteen-day repeat toxicology studies encompassi ng the predicted therapeutic dose range (but less than MTD) have also been proposed to support expanded d osing in microdosing studies. Exploratory IND clinical trials designed to produce a pharmacologic effect were proposed by PhRMA in M ay, 2004, based on a retrospective analysis of 106 drugs which supported the accelerated preclinical s afety testing paradigm. In Phase 0 studies designed to produce a pharmacologic effect, up to five compounds can be studied. The compounds must have a common drug target, but do not necessarily have to be structurally related. Healthy volunteers or minimally ill patients may receive up to 7 repeated doses in the clinic. The goal is to achieve a phar macologic response but not define the maximum toler ated dose (MTD). Preclinical safety requirements are gre ater compared to microdosing studies. Fourteen-day repeat toxicology studies are required, and conducted in rodents (i.e., rats), with full clinic al and histopathology evaluation. In addition, a fu ll safety pharmacology battery, as described by ICH S7a, is required. In other words, untoward pharmacologic ef fects on the cardiovascular, respiratory, and centr al nervous systems are characterized prior to Phase 0. In addition, genotoxicity studies employing bacteri al mutation and micronucleus assays are required. I n addition to the 14-day rodent toxicology study, a repeat dose study in non-rodent specie (typically d og) is conducted at the rat NOAEL dose. The duratio n of the non-rodent repeat dose study is equivalent to the duration of dosing planned for the Phase 0 tria l. If toxicity is observed in the non-rodent specie at the rat NOAEL, the chemical lead candidate will not proceed to Phase 0. The starting dose for Phase 0 s tudies is defined typically as 1/50th the rat NOAEL based on a per meter squared basis. Dose escalatio n in these studies is terminated when: 1) pharmacologic effect or target modulation is observed, 2) a dose equivalent (e.g., scaled to humans on a per meter squared basis) to one-fourth the rat NOAEL, or 3) h uman systemic exposure reflected as AUC reaches \u00bd t he AUC observed in the rat or dog in the 14-day repeat toxicology studies, whichever is less.Early phase clinical trials involving terminally il l patients without therapeutic options, involving p otentially promising drugs for life threatening dis eases, may be studied under limited (e.g., up to 3 days dosing ) conditions employing a Facilitated IND strategy. As with the Phase 0 strategies described above, it is imperative that this approach be defined in partner ship with the FDA prior to implementation. The reduced preclinical safety requirements are sca led to the goals, duration and scope of Phase 0 stu dies. Phase 0 strategies have merit when the initia l clinical experience is not driven by toxicity, when pharmacokinetics are a primary determinant in sele ction from a group of chemical lead candidates (and a bioanalytical method is available to quantify drug concentrations at microdoses), when pharmacodynamic endpoints in surrogate (e.g., blood) or tumor tiss ue is of primary interest, or to assess PK/PD relation ships (e.g., receptor occupancy studies employing P ET scanning). PhRMA conducted a pharmaceutical industry survey in 2007 to characterize the industry's perspective on the current and future utility of exploratory IND studies (3). Of the 16 firms who provided survey re sponses, 56% indicated they had either executed or were planning to execute exploratory IND developmen t strategies. The authors concluded that the merits o f exploratory INDs continue to be debated, however, this approach provides a valuable option to advanc ing drugs to the clinic.There are limitations to the exploratory IND approa ch. Doses employed in Phase 0 studies may not be pr edictive of doses over the human dose range (up to maximum tolerated dose). Phase 0 studies in patient s raises ethical issues, compared to conventional P hase I, in that escalation into a pharmacologically active dose range may not be possible under the Exp loratory IND guidance. Phase 0 strategy is designed to kill drugs early that are likely to fail based on PK or PK/PD. Should Phase 0 lead to a go decision, howeve r, a conventional IND is required for subsequent cl inical trials, adding cost and time.

Section 5 Orphan Drug Designation Development programs for cancer drugs are often muc h more complex as compared to drugs used to treat m any other indications. This complexity often results in extended development and approval timeli nes. In addition, oncology patient populations are often much smaller by comparison to other more prevalent indications. These factors (e.g., limited patent life and smaller patient populations) often complicate commercialization strategies and can, ultimately, make it more difficult to provide patie nt access to important new therapies. To help manage and expedite the commercialization o f drugs used to treat rare diseases, including many cancers, the Orphan Drug Act was signed into law i n 1983. This law provides incentives to help sponsors and investigators develop new therapies for diseas es and conditions of less than 200,000 cases per ye ar allowing for more realistic commercialization.The specific incentives for orphan-designated drugs are as follows: Seven years of exclusive marketing rights to the sp onsor of a designated orphan drug product for the d esignated indication once approval to market has been received from the FDA. A credit against tax for qualified clinical researc h expenses incurred in developing a designated orph an product. Eligibility to apply for specific orphan drug grant s. A sponsor may request orphan drug designation for: A previously unapproved drug. A new indication for a marketed drug. A drug that already has orphan drug status\u2014if the s ponsor is able to provide valid evidence that their drug may be clinically superior to the first drug. A sponsor, investigator, or an individual may apply for orphan drug designation prior to establishing an active clinical program or can apply at any stag e of development (e.g., Phase 1 - 3). If orphan drug des ignation is granted, clinical studies to support th e proposed indication are required. A drug is not g iven orphan drug status and, thus marketing exclusivity, until the FDA approves a marketing application. Or phan drug status is granted to the first sponsor to obtain FDA approval and not necessarily the sponsor originally submitting the orphan drug designation request. There is no formal application for an orphan drug d esignation. However, the regulations (e.g., 21 CRF 316) identify the components to be included. An Orp han Drug Designation Request is typically a five- to te n-page document with appropriate literature referen ces appended to support the prevalence statements o f less than 200,000 cases/year. The Orphan Drug Desig nation Request generally includes: The specific rare disease or condition for which or phan drug designation is being requested. Sponsor contact, drug names, and sources. A description of the rare disease or condition with a medically plausible rationale for any patient su bset type of approach. A description of the drug and the scientific ration ale for the use of the drug for the rare disease or condition. A summary of the regulatory status and marketing hi story of the drug. Documentation (for a treatment indication for the d isease or condition) that the drug will affect fewe r than 200,000 people in the United States Early Drug Discovery and Development Guidelines: Fo r Academic Researchers, Collaborat ors, ... http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92015/?report= printable 17 of 46 7/26/2013 11:44 (prevalence).Documentation (for a prevention indication [or a va ccine or diagnostic drug] for the disease or condit ion) that the drug will affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States per year (incidence). Alternatively, a rationale may be provided for why there is no reasonable expectation that costs of re search and development of the drug for the indication can be recovered by sales of the drug in the United States. Following receipt of the request, the FDA Office of Orphan Product Development (OOPD) will provide an acknowledgment of receipt of the Orphan Drug Designation Request. The official response will typ ically be provided within 1 to 3 months following s ubmission. Upon notification of granting of an orph an drug designation, the name of the sponsor and the p roposed rare disease or condition will be published in the Federal Register as part of public record. The complete Orphan Drug Designation Request is placed in the public domain once the drug has received mar keting approval in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act.Finally, the sponsor of an orphan designated drug m ust provide annual updates that contain a brief sum mary of any ongoing or completed nonclinical or clinical studies, a description of the investigatio nal plan for the coming year, any anticipated diffi culties in development, testing, and marketing, and a brief discussion of any changes that may affect the orpha n drug status of the product Conclusion While many authors have described the general guide lines for drug development (4,5), etc., no one has outlined the process of developing cancer drugs in an academic setting. It is well known that the propens ity for late stage failures has lead to a dramatic increase in the overall cost of drug development ov er the last 15 years. It is also commonly accepted that the bes t way to prevent late stage failures is by increasi ng scientific rigor in the discovery, preclinical, and early clinical stages. Where many authors present Drug Di scovery as a single monolithic process, we intend t o reflect here that there are multiple Decision Poi nts contained within this process. An alternative approach is the Exploratory IND (Pha se 0) under which the endpoint is proof-of principl e demonstration of target inhibition (6). This potentially paradigm-shifting approach may dramatic ally improve the probability of late stage success and may offer additional opportunities for academic medical centers to become involved in drug discover y and development.
