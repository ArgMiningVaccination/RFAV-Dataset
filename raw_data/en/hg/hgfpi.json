This means that practitioners of evidence-based chiropractic care will use a combination of scientific evidence, clinical expertise, and patient values and preferences to guide their decisions about treatment. In contrast, traditional chiropractic care is often based on the beliefs and practices of the founder of chiropractic, Daniel David Palmer, who believed that misaligned vertebrae caused many health problems. Although we know this is not true today, I am very thankful for Dr. Palmer's contributions because if it were not for him, Chiropractic Care would not be around today. This initial belief has evolved into a scientific practice in which chiropractors can treat musculoskeletal pain with manual therapy, adjustments, and exercise. One key difference between evidence-based chiropractic care and traditional chiropractic care is the emphasis on research. Evidence-based chiropractic practitioners will use high-quality, peer-reviewed research to guide their decisions about what treatments to use and how to use them. This means that they will only use treatments that have been shown to be effective through scientific study, rather than relying on tradition or anecdotal evidence. In contrast, traditional chiropractic practitioners may not place as much emphasis on research and may be more likely to rely on the principles and practices developed by Palmer. Another key difference is the focus on patient-centered care. Evidence-based chiropractic practitioners will take the time to listen to their patients, understand their concerns and goals, and work with them to develop a treatment plan that meets their needs. This means that they will consider the individual needs and preferences of each patient, rather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach. In contrast, traditional chiropractic practitioners may be more likely to use a cookie-cutter approach to treatment and may not take the time to fully understand the unique needs of each patient. A third key difference is the use of a broad range of treatment options. Evidence-based chiropractic practitioners will use a variety of treatments, including manual therapy, exercise, and other interventions, to help their patients. They will also be open to referrals to other health care providers when appropriate. In contrast, traditional chiropractic practitioners may be more limited in treatments they offer, and may be more likely to rely solely on manual therapy. "}
