But for people with hand eczema, it can be hard to do anything without a go-to treatment plan. There are [numerous types of eczema](https://www.self.com/story/types-of-eczema), and many of them can affect your hands\u2014but if this is the only area where you're having symptoms, you might have hand eczema. And if your hands are constantly exposed to potential irritants such as chemicals (for example, if you work at a hair salon), your chances of developing hand eczema increase.1 It's worth mentioning that there's another form of eczema, [dyshidrotic eczema](https://www.self.com/story/dyshidrotic-eczema), that commonly affects the hands but can appear on the feet too (more on that below). Hand eczema looks a lot like other skin conditions, so it can take some investigative work to determine if it's the cause of your woes. If it is, then working with a doctor on a hand eczema treatment plan can help you find relief. Read on to learn more.

Hand eczema can easily be mistaken for super dry skin. \"It's not always easy to identify eczema, even to the skilled eye,\" [Jonathan Silverberg, MD, PhD](https://gwdocs.com/profile/jonathan-silverberg), an associate professor in the department of dermatology at the [GW School of Medicine & Health Sciences](https://smhs.gwu.edu), tells SELF. Eczema can affect your entire hand, including the fingers. Hand eczema can look similar to some fungal infections and to [psoriasis](https://www.self.com/story/difference-between-psoriasis-eczema), an [autoimmune disorder](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/autoimmune-diseases) that results in scaly patches on the skin, so getting a proper diagnosis can be challenging. That said, here are some symptoms of hand eczema to watch for, according to the [American Academy of Dermatology](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/eczema/types/hand-eczema) (AAD): [Really dry skin](https://www.self.com/story/dry-skin-eczema), which is often an early sign of eczema on the hands - Pink or red patches on light skin or purple or brown patches on deeper skin - Inflamed, itchy, and scaly skin - Blisters - Cracked skin that may bleed - Bumps that release pus and form a crust on your skin If you have very small, intensely itchy blisters only on the palms of your hands, you might have a specific type of hand eczema called dyshidrotic eczema, according to the AAD. These blisters generally last for roughly three weeks before they dry out and flake off, the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dyshidrosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352342) notes. A dermatologist can help you determine if you have dyshidrotic eczema or something else. What triggers eczema on the hands? Experts aren't sure [why some people develop eczema](https://www.self.com/story/eczema-causes) on their hands. What they do know is that eczema happens when the skin barrier, which acts as a shield, is damaged.2 A [healthy skin barrier](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/skin-health) is important because it locks in moisture and prevents irritants or allergens from penetrating the deeper layers of skin.3 Once you develop hand eczema, you may have times of relief, meaning very few symptoms, as well as periods of flare-ups. Anything that irritates your skin can trigger hand eczema: allergies, detergents, soaps, and even water because it zaps moisture from your skin, according to the AAD. [Stress](https://www.self.com/story/how-stress-impacts-skin) can also play a role. \"Hand eczema can flare up if you're really stressed,\" [Henry Wong, MD, PhD](https://medicine.uams.edu/dermatology/faculty/henry-k-wong/), a dermatologist at the [University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences](https://www.uams.edu), tells SELF. In fact, people who reported higher levels of stress had more severe symptoms compared to people with lower stress levels, according to a 2019 study of 119 people published in Hindawi.4 When it comes to dyshidrotic eczema, the cause is also a mystery. But researchers believe that people who have it are hypersensitive to certain things, such as nickel, and have a flare-up of symptoms when exposed to their sensitivities, according to the AAD. Avoiding your triggers as much as possible is an important part of a hand eczema treatment plan. How do I get rid of eczema on my hands? Generally, hand eczema treatment involves a mix of skin-care strategies and medications. A dermatologist can determine the best treatment plan for you; here are some eczema-friendly skin-care tips in the meantime: Your hands touch a lot of stuff throughout the day so this is easier said than done. But hand eczema gets worse when you're exposed to irritants like cold air, rough fabrics, mold, pet dander, chemicals, and fragrances, according to the [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/eczema-causes-prevention-strategies) (NIAID), so do your best to avoid them. When your eczema flares up, ask yourself, \"What did I touch today?\" It may help to make a list of all the soaps, lotions, cleaning products, and other substances you were in contact with. Then, you can zone in on any new products that may be problematic. This simple medical test can really help pinpoint potential allergens that are causing your hand eczema to flare up, Dr. Silverberg says. During the test, a medical provider will put small amounts of potential allergens on your skin and cover the areas with patches, according to the [AAD](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/eczema/types/contact-dermatitis/patch-testing-rash). Two days later, you'll have a follow-up appointment to see which allergens your skin reacted to. Rubber gloves can help reduce your exposure to dish soap, which may be an irritant for people with hand eczema, [Cynthia Bailey, MD](https://drbaileyskincare.com/pages/meet-dr-cynthia-bailey), a diplomate of the American Board of Dermatology and founder of Dr. Bailey Skin Care, tells SELF. Rubber gloves can also protect your hands from hot water, which can further strip your skin of its natural oils, she says. \"This leads to dryness, disruption of your skin barrier, and the cycle of damage that can end in eczema,\" she says. To protect your hands from the moisture-sapping properties of a long, hot shower, the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atopic-dermatitis-eczema/symptoms-causes/syc-20353273) recommends taking warm showers\u2014not hot\u2014that only last for 10 or 15 minutes. Soaps that have fragrance, alcohol, dyes, or other potential irritants can introduce your hands to a world of itchiness and dryness, according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dry-skin/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353891). So can antibacterial soap, which you may find is harsher on your skin than the regular kind, [Melanie Kingsley, MD](https://iuhealth.org/find-providers/provider/melanie-m-kingsley-md-7290), a dermatologist at [Indiana University Health](https://iuhealth.org/), tells SELF. In general, using products with fewer ingredients limits your exposure to potentially irritating substances. If you can, try to use a hypoallergenic hand cleanser whenever possible, Dr. Bailey says. They tend to be extra-gentle on your skin since their goal is to lower your chances of having an allergic reaction. You can also look for products that have something called the NEA Seal of Acceptance. This is a designation from the [National Eczema Association](https://nationaleczema.org/eczema-products/about-nea-seal-of-acceptance/) that identifies products made without common irritants, such as fragrances, lactic acid, alcohol, and retinoids. Just like with soaps, avoid lotions that contain perfume, dye, or other potentially irritating ingredients. Look for heavy, thick products that have ingredients meant to lock moisture into your skin. The [best cream for hand eczema](https://www.self.com/gallery/best-eczema-creams) isn't fancy or expensive\u2014Dr. Wong recommends using good old-fashioned petroleum jelly. Glycerin is a humectant (meaning it helps attract water to your skin), so that can be a good option. Dimethicone, which is an occlusive (it helps block water loss from your skin and maintain your skin's moisture), can also be helpful. If you're determined to curb your hand eczema, using a moisturizer after washing and drying your hands is essential, [Gary Goldenberg, MD](https://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/gary-goldenberg), assistant clinical professor of dermatology at the [Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai](https://www.mountsinai.org/), tells SELF. Skipping this step is basically setting yourself up for irritation. Try keeping a cream for hand eczema near your hand soap as a good reminder to lube up post-wash, and carry a travel-sized bottle with you when you're out in the world, living your life. In some cases, a diluted bleach bath may help your hand eczema calm down by decreasing eczema-exacerbating bacteria on your skin, according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.self.com/story/eczema-bleach-bath). The keyword here is \"diluted,\" because dunking your hands into a solution that contains too much bleach can just make your eczema worse. The Mayo Clinic recommends mixing just half a cup of bleach in a 40-gallon bathtub filled with water, then soaking your hands for 10 minutes. If you're still a little wary, it's completely valid to ask your doctor if a diluted bleach bath might help your hand eczema before taking the plunge. It's tempting to give your hands a quick rub-down with a towel after you wash them, but it's really better to gently pat them dry. Rubbing your hands too hard can traumatize your skin, Dr. Goldenberg says, which is exactly what someone with hand eczema doesn't need. As a bonus, patting can leave a little more wetness behind, which you can then seal in with the moisturizer of your choice, Dr. Kingsley says. Are there any medications that treat hand eczema? Keep in mind that consistency is key when it comes to your skin-care routine, and it can take some time for your hand eczema symptoms to go away. In the meantime, Dr. Silverberg says he often prescribes medications to provide short-term relief. These typically include: These help relieve symptoms by blocking the immune response that causes inflammation.5 Topical steroids come in various forms, such as ointments, creams, lotions, sprays, and foams. There are numerous types of steroids with varying strengths, and you may need to try several before figuring out which one is best for you. Sometimes, steroids and skin-care habits aren't enough to get rid of hand eczema. In that case, your doctor might recommend phototherapy, which involves exposing affected areas of skin to a very filtered and narrow wavelength of ultraviolet light that helps reduce inflammation.6 Typically, treatment involves two to six sessions a week for up to three months. There are numerous types of immunosuppressant medications and they work by suppressing the immune system response that's involved with inflammation.7 Methotrexate is one commonly prescribed immunosuppressant that can treat hand eczema. These drugs can take about two months to work and are generally used to treat persistent, severe hand eczema8. These are a newer class of medications that are approved for those with moderate to severe eczema in the form of an injectable medication administered every few weeks to every few months, depending on the type you choose. They directly target the parts of your immune system that fuel inflammatory eczema symptoms. If you have dyshidrotic eczema on the hands, the blisters can be next-level itchy and painful. To help relieve the itch, your doctor may prescribe pramoxine, which helps numb the skin and reduce the itch, according to the [National Library of Medicine.](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682429.html) Does hand eczema go away? With the right treatment and lifestyle changes, mild [eczema](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/eczema), characterized by occasional itching and symptoms that don't interfere with your daily life, usually gets better within a few weeks, Dr. Silverberg says. But it could take longer if you have really frequent, ongoing itching that takes a toll on your everyday life. \"I tell patients that if it took two years to get this way, it's going to take some time to clear up. It's not getting better overnight,\" Dr. Silverberg says. Dr. Wong says many of his patients eventually get to a point where their skin is mostly clear. That said, eczema can still lurk under the surface, ready to flare up again with the slightest provocation\u2014which is yet another reason to be gentle on your skin and avoid triggers as much as possible.
