The pharmaceutical industry is responsible for the research, development, production, and distribution of medications. The market has experienced significant growth during the past two decades, and pharma revenues worldwide totalled USD 1.42 trillion in 2021. The Pharma Times, in December 2021, reported that pharma sales in the 60 biggest markets worldwide were projected to grow 4.6% to reach USD 1.5 trillion. Market growth has been bolstered by initiatives taken by global pharma & biopharma companies, such as partnerships with IT, clinical research in IT, digital supply chain & manufacturing, pharmacovigilance software, geographic expansions, mergers & acquisitions, and product innovations to tap the potential growth opportunities in these industries. Opportunity: Growing genomics and proteomics research The rising focus on Genomics and proteomics research in various areas from disease diagnosis to biomarker discovery. This can be attributed to major market developments and growing pharma & biotech R&D funding. Some important developments in this regard have been mentioned below: - In January 2023, Novo Holdings (Denmark) announced a USD 40 million investment in Evosep (Denmark) to provide more customers with a solution for robust and high-throughput proteomics. - In December 2022, the UK government announced a Euro 175 million investment in genomics research, including a study led by Genomics England, in partnership with the National Health Service (NHS), to explore the effectiveness of using whole-genome sequencing to find and treat rare genetic diseases in new-born babies. - In December 2022, Health and Social Care Secretary announced A Euro 175 million fund for cutting-edge genomics research for patients with cancer and children born with treatable rare genetic diseases. Euro 105 million will be spent on a research study led by Genomics England in partnership with the NHS. The study will explore the effectiveness of using whole genome sequencing to find and treat rare genetic diseases in newborn babies. - In December 2022, Parallel Bio secured USD 4.3 million seed round to accelerate drug discovery through the human immune system in a dish. The investment capital has enabled it to prove the viability of its immune-system-in-a-dish platform and accelerate the pace of drug discovery and development. - November 2022, the Ontario government launched a USD 15 million Life Sciences Innovation Fund to help life sciences entrepreneurs and innovators bring their ideas and prototypes from the lab to the marketplace. Eligible companies will receive up to USD 500,000 to scale their made-in-Ontario health solutions both at home and in global markets. Challenge: Dearth of skilled professionals The proper usage of life science and analytical technologies requires expertise with relevant experience and knowledge, high throughput screening, compound weighting and dissolution, DNA/RNA purification, NGS, PCR, and sample preparation. Lack of knowledge may cause several direct and indirect expenses as well as increases the workload and time pressure on researchers. This also leads to inefficient practical experience and an insufficient understanding of the phenotypic implications of sequencing-based data. A research paper related to NGS, published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (US), states that the growing demand and the increasing adoption of NGS technologies in Australia are emphasizing the need for skilled biologists to handle and analyze NGS data. This highlights the need for highly skilled personnel for method development, validation, operation, and troubleshooting activities\u2014the dearth of such a workforce can, therefore, be said to directly impact the growth of the market. Currently, there is a shortage of skilled personnel for method development, validation, operation, and troubleshooting activities, which is expected to challenge the growth of the market to an extent in the coming years. This shortage of skilled labor in major markets is expected to affect the optimum growth potential of the market during the forecast period.
