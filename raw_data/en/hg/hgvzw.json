He also avoided killing Daredevil, and when presented with the chance to kill him, Castle simply resorted to knocking him out. After Billy Russo murdered several prostitutes and framed Castle for the crime, he was in disbelief and shock that he took innocent lives, leading to him losing his drive as the Punisher. However, after discovering his innocence in the matter, his drive for vengeance and to take down Russo returned and he readopted the mantle. She could be apathetic, cynical, and threatening. Despite his outwardly cold nature, behind her exterior was hiding a famous for her beauty, locks of curly, raven black hair fragrant with lilac and gooseberry perfume, falling in a cascade of curls on her shapely shoulders. Her face was very pale, triangular in shape with a slightly receded chin. Her eyes were cold and sparkling with a remarkable violet penetrating gaze, in anger blazing with livid, blue-gray fire. Those very eyes also concealed wisdom and imperiousness. her nose was slightly long, mouth was pale with thin and slightly crooked, soft, sweet with lipstick, proud lips. On her long and slender neck hung a black marigold with a star made of obsidian sparkling with a multitude of tiny diamonds embedded in it. She had pronounced cheekbones, natural, slightly irregular eyebrows trimmed by hand and emphasized with charcoal, long eyelashes, and petite hands. Even in high-heeled shoes she wasn't tall, was beautiful but threatening, having incredibly thin and slender waist and slender legs. She always dressed in black and white, at times wore stockings, wore frilled panties but never wore trivialities with underwire, she didn't need to. Her voice was resonant and mildly derisive. Her overall feminine shape was one of a twenty-year-old girl and she moved with a natural, unforced grace. Geralt was also shown to be extremely adept at allaying intense, and at times bleak, situations and as a man who would much sooner have everyone return home than draw their swords. His lifespan made him a world-weary man, often expressing disdain and circuitous insults to those he considered cruel, foolish, etc. He may have risked Temeria's future to save Triss Merigold from the Nilfgaardians. He also was shown requesting Scoia'tael to spare Dandelion and kill only him. Other times he had complete emotional breakdowns, even giving up being a witcher in general and dropping his morals at one point. Cold and ruthless demeanor, strongly and deeply misses her beloved family, wishes to make up for her inability to protect her loved ones, her true home is only at wartime and when she feels like a soldier. Despite having the chance to honor their memories and accept their deaths, Castle believes his vengeance against those who murdered them is more important and ultimately what drives him to war. It is ultimately the lack of conflict in life that scares Castle rather than death and having no true home to call to. At the same time, he does not seem to care what the citizens of New York and the law enforcement think of him as he has witnessed their ineptitude in dealing with his family's murder first hand. He openly sneered at Daredevil for considering himself a \"hero\" as he claims that he was only \"one bad day away\" from being like Castle. Indeed, Castle knocks out Daredevil when he claimed that he was insane and goes into a furious rant in court when they planned to instigate him into a mental asylum, admitting he was fully sane and enjoyed killing every criminal he encountered. Dislikes being thought of as insane or not in control of her actions. Thick, longish hair; expressive, silver-blue eyes; and flawless skin. Her boyishly charming features would look at home on a magazine cover. She appeared as a tall and lean young woman, thick, tousled silver-white hair to her shoulders, a handsome, open face, expressive and penetrating silver-blue eyes, and extremely fair and flawless skin, strong, athletic build with boyishly charming features, \"unapproachably attractive\". A very brave and loyal person with strong willpower, her mind remained clear, did not seem to have fallen into a state of depression or insanity, experiences extraordinary clarity. Capable of retaining her sanity during imprisonment. Pure, perceptive, good at reading people, can detect traitors and spies. Exceptionally skilled in using a sword and shield, managed to handle two assailants simultaneously, killing both, she slew dozens, almost effortlessly. Skilled and capable leader, taking charge of a situation with a calm and collected mind. She possessed a big talent and a dramatic flair for leadership, proved herself to be strategic and tactical. Fluent in a number of different languages. Exceptional eyesight, vitality, solitary, has some skill at healing injuries on others, heals exceptionally quickly, has a distinct aura, extremely powerful, great potential, lived alone for years, has trouble socializing, dutiful, socially awkward. Very understanding, smart, sweet, caring, selfless, cares about peoples' well-being, courageous, protective, saved lives and risked her own many times, she is for real. Outside of \"the mission,\" Castle does have other interests and even a certain sense of fun, such as playing guitar. He seems to have a liking for disco and funk, commenting that he enjoyed singing along to \"Shining Star\" by Earth Wind & Fire so much that he nearly drove the rest of his unit crazy with it. He also enjoys reading and goes through books at a fast pace. Beyond this Castle has no interest in making friends as seen when he was working as a construction worker where he worked tirelessly without breaks for six months with almost no human contact towards his co-workers with the exception of occasionally meeting with Curtis Hoyle. Despite this, Castle has shown the capability to grow emotionally attached to people in his life regardless of his hardened exterior as seen with David Lieberman and Amy Bendix. Although he first acted cold and distant towards her, Castle eventually warmed up to and became protective of Bendix. He expressed a very genuine concern for her well-being and threatened to kill a hitman if he was to harm Amy in any way. Later, when Bendix was about to leave to return to a normal life, Castle said he would miss her and even hugged her, a sign of affection that he rarely showed to others. - Somewhat unstable.

He was able to go toe-to-toe against the enormously skilled Daredevil, even briefly gaining the upper hand against him in their first encounter. His fighting style includes martial arts disciplines from the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program, such as Krav Maga, Boxing, Muay Thai, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Judo, Karate, Wrestling, Combat Hapkido, Savate, Kung Fu, Kickboxing and Taekwondo. He impressed Daredevil with his speed and ferocity, despite the latter ultimately being able to get the upper hand in the fight, with the use of his agility. Hence, Castle, while unarmed, survived being ambushed by multiple armed prison inmates at once, swiftly taking them all down in a brutal bloodthirsty fashion, greatly impressing Wilson Fisk, who claimed that Castle has a \"unique talent.\" Castle also quickly overpowered William Rawlins, held his own against Carson Wolf, and defeated Billy Russo after a prolonged fight. Marion James stated Rawlins looked like he was \"hit by a train\" after he was overpowered and killed by Castle, and Sam Stein drafted an extensive medical examination after Castle killed Carson Wolf. Marlena Olin later commended his fighting skills after seeing him fight in Lola's Roadhouse. He was able to brutally beat down all the Russians using their gym equipment and switch target every time to hit both of them. Castle could also take down several armed guards in the elevator that armed with firearms and batons and defeat John Pilgrim while being extremely exhausted after multiple injuries he suffered from. Castle possesses a high pain tolerance that allows him to continue fighting even after being beaten by crowbars, dumbbells, punched with a chain-wrapped fist, and even being shot. During his attempted attack on Billy Russo, Castle was able to kill several of Russo's henchmen even after they beat him ruthlessly with crowbars. In fact, being beat only seemed to enrage him more. - highly skilled at using knives in combat. He often prefers to incorporate knife slashes into his combat style, making him all the more lethal. He has also showcased skills in knife-throwing, Castle is also very skilled at disarming and countering knives, managing to take away knife, as well as deflecting and taking other mercenaries' knives before stabbing them with it. - \"One shot... one kill. You taught me that.\" - Frank Castle to Ray Schoonover[src] - Master Marksman: Castle graduated from Marine Corps Base in Quantico of class 307. A former scout sniper and marine, Castle is an extremely skilled and accurate marksman, with tremendous expertise and experience in handling many firearms, including pistols, revolvers, automatic rifles, shotguns, submachine guns, sniper rifles, machine guns, and grenade launchers. Due to his military training, Frank Castle is a deadly shot, adhering to his unit's philosophy of \"one shot, one kill,\" managing to shoot Ahmad Zubair, Nesbitt, Daredevil, Finn Sicario, Paulie, Moose, Tony Gnucci, Jack, Davy, Mike, Davis, Todd, and Eliza Schultz all in the head. With his devastating use in firearms, he made many criminals and police officials believe his attacks were the work of a group or \"army.\" Hence, as the Punisher, Castle rarely misses his target, and easily avoids injuring innocent civilians, thus managing to swiftly take down the last four Hand ninjas without wounding Daredevil, all from an immense distance away. Castle later sniped the Cartel Sicario in the head with an immensely long range from across the border. Castle can also shoot his enemies in nonlethal spots to prolong their suffering or to interrogate them before they die, as he did with Marlena Olin by intentionally missing her bone by shooting through and through the meat in her thigh, leading Evans to refer to him as \"one hell of a shot,\" meaning phenomenal. During John Pilgrim's attack on the Larkville police station, he shot a Molotov cocktail before an assassin could throw it, dousing him in flames. Outside Tipsy Tilly's Bar, Castle quickly gunned down six bounty hunters before five of them could pull their weapons on him. Castle can also hit his targets without actually seeing them, demonstrated when he fired his rifle from one flight of stairs above him to kill two hitmen. Finn Cooley described Castle as an \"artist with the AK,\" and Blake Tower later said that Castle \"shot the city to hell.\" a very humble person, despite her enormous achievements and intellect, usually calm, but when pushed or forced to defend herself, she had no qualms about injuring her enemy, and hurt them enough so that she would prevent future attacks. Noble, empathetic, generous, and strong willed, she was determined to win and beat those who stood in her way, a very compassionate person, in fact too compassionate for battle. She cared greatly for the people around her, including strangers. This love of humanity translated into her various historical novels about the history of wars or the countries she visited. - \"He's tracking enemies to their home turf and taking them out with military precision.\" - Master Assassin: Castle is an extremely skilled assassin. His Marine Corps service enables him to locate his enemies and eliminate them with military precision. According to Blake Tower and Samantha Reyes, survivors of his brutal kill methods are certain to be found and killed by him, even if they're under assumed names. His aptitude for killing has left many astonished, including Karen Page, Grotto and Kingpin, and he is so effective he was initially mistaken to be a group of trained killers rather than a single person. He has eliminated high-profile targets with the Cerberus Squad and trained to use weapons with superb efficiency. He is surgical and precise, using all of his skills with firearms, stealth and hand-to-hand combat to kill his opponents, seen when he singlehandedly and systematically killed multiple Mujahideen in Kandahar, members of the Kitchen Irish at the Burren Club, members of the Mexican Cartel in the Meatpacking District, members of the Dogs of Hell at a Redfield Electronics garage, more of the Kitchen Irish at the Central Park carousel, an entire wing of prisoners on Ryker's Island, Ray Schoonover's henchman guarding his ship, the Gnucci Crime Family under Linello's, Mazur and his gang in their garage, a squad of Anvil agents in Micro's Hideout, Marlena Olin's mercenaries at the Tides Motel, John Pilgrim's mercenaries in Larkville, Russian thugs in Kazan's Gym, members of Jigsaw's Crew outside ReadyQuick Check Cashing, bounty hunters outside Tipsy Tilly's Bar and on Crescent Street, members of Jigsaw's Crew in Valhalla, and finally over a dozen gangsters in an abandoned warehouse. Castle was able to snap a neck of prisoner and Carson Wolf, and quickly draw his guns to fire at his enemies. Castle is also able to see deadly potential in objects in order to weaponize his environment against his opponents, such as when he bashed a Mujahideen's head in with a rock, bludgeoned Clint with a metal baseball bat, killed Dutton and his bodyguard with a shiv, impaled a prisoner with a sharpened wooden stick, broke a pot of coffee over Speed's head, ran over two Dogs of Hell with his van, strangled Mickey O'Hare with his own necktie, beat Paulie, Leo and Lance with a sledgehammer, hit Carson Wolf in the head with a toaster and photo frame, slammed Eddie's head through a bathroom sink, used dumbbells to defeat Kazan's henchmen, used weights to overpower and kill the Russian, and improvised scrap metal against John Pilgrim in a junkyard. Micro accurately stated that Castle was turned into a hitman, and Dinah Madani sought to recruit him directly to assist in the apprehension of a high-value target, disregarding all other agents of the CIA in favor of his skills, declaring him to be \"the best\" in his line of work. - Posset - Another possible form of the dish mentioned in The Last Court, it a cold dessert made from thickened cream, typically flavored with lemon. - Sponge Cake - Chocolate Sponge Cake - Cow butter - Goat butter - Halla butter - Herbed butter - Cheese - Blue-veined cheese - Brie cheese - \"Dalish Cheese\" - an edible item though it is unclear if this is actually cheese, but it certainly isn't Dalish. - Feisty cheese - Goat cheese - Brined goat cheese - Halla cheese - Ram cheese - Cream - Spiced cream - Thickened cream - Whipped cream - Milk - Cow milk - Goat milk - used to make goat cheese. In the tabletop, the Avvar trade goat milk with the dwarves. - Ram milk - Soured milk - - Chocolate Sponge Cake Eggs[ ] - Caviar - Chicken egg - Egg whites - Egg yolk - Master Combatant: As a United States Marine with years of experience, Russo was an extremely skilled and lethal master hand-to-hand combatant with his bare hands, which allowed him to hold his own during a prolonged fight against Frank Castle, and manage to briefly gain the upperhand before getting defeated. Russo was also able to swiftly and brutally subdue both officers in the Sacred Saints Hospital, using their own batons and tasers to his advantage as he managed to beat them both into submission, breaking the last officer's hand and tasering his neck. He was also able to murder Rick as he was wielding switchblade, disarmed him and overpowered Dinah Madani. Russo also possesses high pain tolerance which let him continuing to fight after Dinah Madani shoot him two to three bullets, making him able to still stand up without any tiring and pain before being unconscious. Highly skilled at using a staff in combat. Highly skilled at using knives and other bladed weaponry in combat. - Master Marksman: Russo was trained to utilize firearms during his service for United States Marine Corps. After returning home, he brought his training alongside him. A marine, Russo got experience, tremendous expertise and trained many firearms including pistols, revolvers, automatic rifles, shotguns, submachine guns, sniper rifles, machine guns, and grenade launchers. He has excellent accuracy, as Russo even stated to Frank Castle that he wouldn't have missed the bullet that wounded Castle at the Massacre at Central Park if he was there. He managed to shoot Tom Weems, Dinah Madani, Anton Reed and Bobby all in the head. Russo also easily shot Homeland Security agents with accurate silent shots without getting caught, and he quickly shot at Frank Castle with accurate shot, that he could not react to. - \"You killed Stein.\" - Dinah Madani to Billy Russo[src] - Master Assassin: Russo was an extremely skilled assassin. His Marine Corps service enables him to locate his enemies and eliminate them with military precision. Russo has worked with Cerberus Squad to kill his high-profile targets and also trained to use superb weapons. He was also precise with his weapons, using all his trainings with firearms, stealth and hand-to-hand combatant to kill his targets easily as seen he was able to track down, shoot and kill Arthur Walsh at his home to avenge him for all Russo's abusive from him, agent Sam Stein at the Abandoned Warehouse, Morty Bennett and his mistress at the motel, all the Homeland Security agents at Anvil Headquarters, two guards at Sacred Saints Hospital, Bobby and Anton Reed at his hideout, Rick outside the street and three young innocent women at his office. Russo even stated to Arthur Walsh that he lost his memory but still able to remember his home address for his assassination. She generally had a bad temper but was able to stay calm and collected during sticky situations. She is slightly anti-social with strong morals and was known to be \"deadly\". On her days off, however, she enjoyed a nice book or even singing along to her favorite West Side Story song. As time progressed, she seemed to soften somewhat, developing friendships with her coworkers. She did not seem overtly interested in relationships. A coward who always has an excuse or someone else to blame. A master manipulator, who was able to adjust her personality in order to gain the trust of others. Knows everyone's jobs and positions, is ready for whatever happens. During his imprisonment, Ward evolved to being his own person, as he was previously restricted by his almost blind loyalty towards Garrett, to the point of even ignoring his own desires. Ward became more remorseless and manipulative as he demonstrated when he knew Skye's pressure points and attempted to use his knowledge of her father to exploit them. He also murdered numerous guards during his escape and his brother and his parents as revenge for the years of abuse they put him through. When he was reinstated as a member of HYDRA, he still continued to aid S.H.I.E.L.D. to re-earn their trust, particularly Skye's, but this ultimately ended when she and Simmons attempted to kill him on separate occasions. As a result, he grew a far darker personality and sadistic tendencies, as shown with the kidnapping of Bobbi Morse and torturing her in order to give Kara Palamas the closure she needed. When he was tricked by Melinda May into killing Kara Palamas, that was the last straw for Ward; he vowed revenge against S.H.I.E.L.D. and was willing to join HYDRA as its new leader into order to gain \"closure\". - \"Obi-Wan is a great mentor; as wise as Master Yoda, and as powerful as Master Windu.\" - Anakin Skywalker Obi-Wan Kenobi proved himself to be a great military strategist and a highly studious man, demonstrating good knowledge on galactic history and conventions of war, like the Yavin Code. General Kenobi personally led his troops to many famous victories during the Clone Wars, and his persuasive demeanor earned him the moniker of \"The Negotiator.\" Despite his dislike of flying, Kenobi was an excellent pilot. During the Clone Wars, he led many attacks from the cockpit of his Jedi starfighter or his Jedi interceptor, proving to be an outstanding pilot when navigating through an asteroid field in pursuit of Jango Fett's ship and evading his seismic charges unscathed. In fact, Kenobi had once rather enjoyed flying, prior to an incident during and his Qui-Gon Jinn's mission to Pijal. Kenobi was also a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, having developed enough level of skill in unarmed combat so as to compete with Pre Vizsla, leader of the Death Watch, in unarmed techniques, though he outclassed the Mandalorian in lightsaber technique. During his duel with Jango Fett on Kamino, Kenobi was briefly deprived of his lightsaber, and fought the bounty hunter in unarmed combat. Furthermore, while he preferred lightsabers, Kenobi was an excellent marksman, as demonstrated during his time as \"Rako Hardeen\" in Moralo Eval's Box and by his defeat of Grievous with his own blaster. 1.82 meters and weighed 81 kilograms. fair skin, gray-blue eyes, and auburn hair which had turned white in her later years. rebellious and willful, described as breaking the rules left and right. However, throughout much of his early apprenticeship to Qui-Gon Jinn, Kenobi possessed strong fondness for rigid rules and a largely by-the-book attitude when it came to matters such as the Jedi Code. He felt as if he never truly understood his master and yet nevertheless wished to please him and earn his respect. He also had trouble understanding his master's hobbies and interests, such as study of arcane Jedi prophecies. At various points, he considered the fact that Jinn could be kicked out of the Order and wondered what would happen to him if such a case were to occur. The two later came to realization that Yoda intentionally placed Kenobi with a maverick master in the hope that he would rebel in the only way possible: by attempting to become a model Jedi. Over time, Kenobi would become loyal and dedicated to Jinn, possessing a dry sense of humor and sarcastic wit. Yoda said that he sensed Qui-Gon Jinn's defiance in him, and Jinn himself reflected upon Kenobi's considerable knowledge and potential; he also considered his Padawan a lot wiser than he, if somewhat headstrong. Leading up to his Jedi Trials, Kenobi was very nervous and lost sleep worrying about them. Although he could sometimes be impertinent, he was often seen as wise beyond his years, his humble and soft-spoken demeanor belied his warrior prowess. Despite his numerous complaints during flight, and deeply shaken by an experience involving autopursuit in his youth, he was also a skilled pilot. In many ways, he represented the strength of the old Jedi Order: steadfast, selfless, and modest. His later skill at resolving disputes without a single battle would earn him the sobriquet \"The Negotiator,\" at least in the eyes of General Grievous. Over time, Kenobi lost some of his youthful audacity and assumed the role of a more cautious and conservative mentor to Anakin Skywalker, who was in many ways his opposite in personality. The two had a very strange dynamic early on, with Kenobi feeling protective and responsible for his young Padawan and Skywalker worrying about Kenobi's commitment to him, having been abandoned in his life previously. Kenobi knew of these feelings, evidenced by waking up to see Skywalker had moved to sleep on the floor next to his bed. Kenobi often worried he was not fit to teach Skywalker and sometimes would lie awake at night thinking of things to teach his apprentice. As their relationship deepened over time, the two found that they could easily get on each other's nerves, with Kenobi becoming particularly annoyed by his Padawan's habit of grinding his teeth in frustration. Kenobi carefully measured his actions in any situation, garnering him the aforementioned nom de guerre. Kenobi was also known to be an accomplished storyteller. While hiding in the Jundland Wastes in his later years, he appeared as a kindly and eccentric old hermit. Owen Lars described him as \"a crazy old man\" to those not familiar with the ways of the Jedi. In his final days, Kenobi retained his traits of patience and foresight as well as gaining some of the boldness reminiscent of his youth. Kenobi often thought out plans and strategies rather than leaping into action. He would usually place his hand on his chin or stroke his beard as he thought. This was a common trait of the Jedi Master, one that his apprentice Anakin Skywalker did not practice very often. He sometimes mentally repeated the Jedi Code to calm himself. He had also served as a mentor to Skywalker's Padawan, Ahsoka Tano. Tano recognized that Kenobi had more patience than Skywalker, but she also fondly remembered how they would bicker. Tano believed Kenobi would have enjoyed the strategy game crokin. Kenobi's respect for the lives of others led him to emerge from hiding to save Ezra Bridger and the C1-series astromech droid Chopper from succumbing to the deserts of Tatooine. Kenobi then reproved Ezra for succumbing to Maul's manipulation and counselled the young rebel to return to his place with the rebellion. Despite not hating Maul, Kenobi was prepared to fight and kill him in self defense. However, that caused him to get consumed a bit on the dark side, as Maul was the culprit in the death of his friend and mentor Qui-Gon Jinn. After mortally wounding Maul, Kenobi comforted the former Sith and assured him that he was watching over the \"Chosen One,\" Luke Skywalker, though Luke was not the Chosen One by prophecy. When he confronted Vader on the Death Star, Kenobi found himself unable to believe his foe was once his friend, even being unable to call him by his name; he used the title \"Darth\" instead, while he also realized his own anger was rising as Vader spoke. - \"This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away...to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless!\" - Yoda In his youth, Skywalker was often curious, impatient, looking ahead to the future with little regard for his present surroundings, and even a bit brash. Like his father, he was impulsive, reckless, and often had little regard for his own personal safety. According to Yoda, he had a \"gaping need\" for a connection to his father and to have a family. Some time after the Battle of Yavin, he would confer with Nakari Kelen that he regretted his behavior before then, acknowledging he complained \"about everything\" because of his desire to escape from Tatooine. He also acknowledged his scarce talent at lying, a trait that many people could infer. He once confided in Leia that he felt Tatooine had never felt like a home to him. became more patient and seasoned. often seen as having wisdom beyond her years; still retained her idealistic viewpoint, willing to think the best of anyone, and believing that they are redeemable. unable to ignore those who needed help, sometimes to the point of endangering missions for the sake of saving someone else's life, strong sense of morality and a need to help others despite likely danger. Based on observing Owen and Beru Lars, Skywalker grew up believing in showing his love to people rather than telling them. When he and Nakari Kelen fell in love, he demonstrated his feelings for her, but he did not tell her how he felt; he regretted that as grieved for her death alongside the then-recent losses of his aunt, uncle, and Obi-Wan Kenobi. While stranded on Hubin, Skywalker was instantly smitten with Tula Markona and they shared a kiss, but it would be a one-time event. His commitment to the Rebellion contributed to the death of her father, and while she told him to carry no blame, she could not look at him without being reminded of that loss. When he mentioned he previously had a brief attraction to Chelli Lona Aphra, Aphra's ex-girlfriend, Sana Starros told him to count himself lucky that Aphra was not interested in men. Skywalker and Rey\u00e9 Hollis each appreciated the other man's smile and pleasantly-scented hair. Following the end of the Empire and the death of the Sith Order, Skywalker came to have great hope for the future of the Jedi, coming to believe that if a single Jedi could help bring back balance to the Force, then a restored Jedi Order perhaps could maintain that achieved peace and prevent the dark side of the Force from ever regaining its hold on the galaxy. This belief led Luke to scour worlds for the remaining Jedi texts and gathered a new class of apprentices under his tutelage. During his brief time as Grogu's master, Luke had to suppress his more sentimental side and be more professional in an effort to successfully pass on the Jedi values to the child. Very little is known about Dwemeris, the Dwemeri language, but there have been many attempts to translate it using Aldmeris for reference and comparison. Some Dwemer books, especially records dating from after the founding of Resdayn, were written in Aldmeris, making them accessible to modern scholars. However, even in Aldmeris, many Dwemer terms remain uncertain. As the books and other artifacts in Dwemer ruins rarely show signs of wear or age, leading some to believe that the Dwemer knew of a preservative effect, perhaps a device still active which denies or controls the Earth Bones governing time and decay. Several different, incomplete styles of written Dwemeris appear throughout Tamriel. The glyphs found in the ruins on Stros M'Kai differ significantly from those found in Cyrodiil and Morrowind, which suggests there may have been dialects or variations across the Dwemer clans. Some of spoken Dwemeris remains in prefixes and suffixes in historical names, such as \"Volen-\", meaning \"hammer\", and \"-Fell\" meaning \"city\", giving Volenfell; \"City of the Hammer\". The Dwemer lived in strongholds, often called Freehold colonies or city-states, which are typically laden with ancient steam-powered contraptions, many of which are still running. They are thought to have delved down to a certain threshold in the ground, known as a \"Geocline\", before they began building the vital structures of a colony. There are hundreds if not thousands of Dwarven buildings made of precise square shapes, but far fewer examples of rounded or curved stonework, suggesting the Dwemer favored well-calculated designs based on angled lines rather than riskier, more imprecise calculations using arcs and curves. Numerous pipes can be found in and around Dwemer ruins, and many devices and constructs appear to emit steam from their inner workings. There may be \"boilers\" or similar components housed inside the Dwemer Centurions. It has been speculated that the constructs are powered by some kind of checkpoint in each ruin, or possibly by the combined signal of every ruin's mechanics, but this is not certain. There seem to have been regional differences in architectural and engineering styles; for instance, the prevalent style among northern clans is now known as \"Deep Venue\", wherein several structures are built within natural caverns. Arcanex are smaller, largely above-ground structures that are believed to have been research centers of some kind, though little is known about them thanks to looters. Animoculotories are Dwemer factories found within many strongholds. Dwemer constructs taken from Vvardenfell, where many Dwemer ruins are present, appear to shut down when a certain distance between them and Red Mountain is reached. It also seems that many objects which may be found in ruins were once covered in mesh or cloth, which has decayed over the years. This would explain why the \"home comforts\" of the Dwemer may seem very spartan to a visitor. There are also few large halls in most ruins. This could be due to the fact that most if not all Dwemer ruins are underground, where large interior spaces are difficult to fashion at best. Many Dwemer colonies were named after their rulers. The largest concentration of strongholds is in Vvardenfell (which translates as \"City of the Strong Shield\" in Dwemeris). Many Redguards in Hammerfell have shown a particular interest in the Dwemer ruins there for unknown reasons. Contrary to many legends, archaeological evidence of known Dwemer ruins leads one to believe that they were about the same size as the typical human or elf, evidenced by the fact that all existing Dwarven armor is average sized (although some claim that \"Dwarven armor\" is either the outer shells of machines or mismatched pieces from various devices). According to fable, the moniker \"dwarf\" may have been given long ago by the giants to their \"little\" friends. Imperial excavation of Dwemer ruins supports the Dlyxexic theory that the translation of Dwemer as Deep Elves might also be read as Smart Elves. Indeed, perhaps the brilliant students of the Ehlnofey mentioned in The Anuad are the Dwarves themselves. Purported descriptions of the last living Dwemer cannot be relied upon, as he was admittedly bloated and deformed by Corprus, and the only other visual examples come from sculptures and Dwarven Spectres found in their ruined dwellings. It can be deduced, however, that long beards were popular among the lost elves, and they preferred heavy metal armors and robes. Their remaining features could be described similarly to that of the other elven races, as no specific information exists. It is unknown whether the Dwemer worshipped any gods. However, it is known that they despised and scorned the Daedra, and mocked the \"foolish\" rituals of their followers, \"prefer[ring] instead their gods of Reason and Logic\". These may be metaphorical or literal terms; Vivec, the author, capitalized them in his writings which could be interpreted as an emphasized admonishment of their idolatry by means of substituting spiritual worship with absolute faith in those ideas. It could also be meant to suggest some sort of deified representation of those ideas or aspects of Dwemer thought. Since the Heart of Lorkhan offered some form of shared spiritual link among the Dwemer attuned to it - this could also refer to the collective reason and logic of the Dwemer people given voice through the powers of Tonal Architecture and the heart of a dead god. The Dwemer religion, if it can even be called that, is said to be one of the most complex and difficult puzzles of Dwemer culture. Dwarven temples are known to exist, such as the one located deep in the mines of Fang Lair. According to the ancient engravings Dwarven executioners were known as \"Chun Abakch\". They were known to always conceal their features under a hood of black spidersilk, a material that was also used for funeral shrouds. After Ben Solo, his nephew, betrayed him and killed most of his apprentices, Skywalker became embittered as well as grief-ridden and chose to exile himself to the planet Ahch-To, where he would spend the rest of his life in with the intention of dying where the Jedi began to forever end the Jedi. He also became more cautious in teaching others of immense power due to Solo's betrayal, feeling finished with the Jedi Order, as evidenced when he initially refused to train Rey and would later decide to abruptly end their lessons after seeing her drawn towards the dark side. He also now believed that there was no hope for those who fell to the dark side, as shown when he openly expressed that he believed there was no hope for Kylo Ren to return to the light. By this point, Skywalker had come to regard Ren as his responsibility and his greatest failure. However, after Yoda's spirit encouraged him that Rey was the Jedi's hope, Skywalker finally realized his wrongs and chose to help the Resistance. Despite his lost faith in his nephew, Skywalker showed great remorse for failing to stop his fall to the dark side, and for himself ending up being the turning point in Solo's fall. Skywalker realized that instead of blaming himself, he blamed the Jedi for his failures. His belief of the Jedi being romanticized deities with a legacy of failure remained, but gained realization that if one stripped away the sacred temples, lightsabers, and even the legends about them, they were just good people the galaxy needed. - \"Luke is the best bush pilot in the Outer Rim Territories.\" Skywalker was acknowledged to be an expert pilot, being the person who was responsible for destroying the first Death Star and managing to evade Darth Vader himself (albeit with help from Han Solo). He also managed to destroy an Interdictor vessel on his own while piloting the Desert Jewel, although he acknowledged that R2-D2 saved him when the astromech droid made the ship jump into hyperspace in the nick of time. He was also able to pilot a Imperial Lambda-class T-4a shuttle with relative ease, outmaneuvering an RZ-1 A-wing interceptor that was trying to get a lock on him. In fact, Skywalker had a talent for tinkering and a passion for speed. Various Dwemer schematics The Dwemer appear to have been a highly technologically advanced and particularly dogmatic race. Other races have still not cracked the secret behind their metal. Their weapons were simple but effective; weaponsmiths relied on creating quality materials first and merely allowed the form of those materials to flow from the method of the weapon's use. Their mastery of steam and geothermal power through tapping into the natural lava sources under Morrowind allowed them to create airships, sentient machines, mechanical observatories, and lighting systems that continued to work for centuries without any maintenance. Most of their settlements are still inhabited by Animunculi, enchanted mechanical guardians, commonly known as \"Centurions\" or \"Spheres\". They appear somehow linked to their place of origin and will lose power if removed from the vicinity. This may explain why many Animunculi remain active even after so long and supports the theory that they are strongly influenced by magic. Additionally, it appears that some Animunculi are capable of interpreting the actions of people around them - in a sense, 'perceiving' their intent - and responding accordingly. The Dwemer were somewhat comforted by their ability to empower lifeless fabrics into active beings through systematic regression techniques, denying the organic power of the gods while at the same time transcending the mortal systems of life. This culture, often seen as sheer arrogance by others, allowed their technological capabilities to accelerate well ahead of any other race. In addition, the Dwemer also appear to have dabbled extensively and somewhat successfully in some of the more divine (or arcane) arts and sought to harness the supernatural powers of the Divines within their mechanical technology, even keeping an Elder Scroll within the massive underground complex of Blackreach in Skyrim. The Dwemer had headgear known as Dwarven Miters, which gave them the ability that was known as \"The Calling\", which seems to have been similar to telepathy. It allowed the Dwemer to communicate with each other over great distances. Three known varieties of miters exist, with the master miter being worn by the \"Tuathumz\" or \"central pylon\" of their Thought Calling system. It contains three finials thought to be broadcast-foci. The spiked miter has spikes believed they actually functioned as \"etheric antenna,\" helping with long-distance Thought Calls. The common visor miter lacks these features. It has been suggested that, in the last moments before they disappeared, Lord Kagrenac used The Calling to summon all of the Dwemer people and rally them to carry out his plans to transcend the Mortal Plane. Whether this was related to their demise or not is uncertain. Secretive, Deep Folk and connoting variously with deep-delving, profound, and close-counseled. The early history of the Dwemer is still clouded in mystery. There is no known story of their dissociation from the Aldmer, which must have occurred very early in Tamrielic history, as their society bore few correlations with that of the Altmer besides some similar legal principles. According to legend, the Dwemer originated from the same group as the Dunmer, and were treated as another tribe, and later, as a secular Great House. The Dwemer built elaborate underground cities near and beneath mountain ranges, including the Velothi Mountains and Red Mountain, and in the mountains of the isle Stros M'Kai. Many misconceptions about them have abounded for centuries: scholars long thought that most Dwemer ruins which dotted Tamriel outside Morrowind were mere outposts and that there were few significant Dwemer settlements elsewhere until 1E 420. The presentation of the Dwemer in fictitious but popular novels like the Ancient Tales of the Dwemer has also lodged an inaccurate impression of them in the popular consciousness, painting them as familiar, comfortable characters who were very similar to humans. In reality, they are better described as having been fearsome, unfathomable, and even cruel, though also careful, intelligent, and industrious. Their society consisted of free-thinking yet reclusive clans devoted to the secrets of science, engineering, and the arcane until they mysteriously disappeared around 1E 700. There are a number of theories on how this happened, though none of them can be confirmed. deathless wizard who it seems is not only immortal but grows more youthful by the century. speak of Mother Sea in reverence, but whether they refer to the entity or place is unknown. The Maormer are believed to practice a powerful form of snake magic, which they use to tame the sea serpents of their island for use as steeds and warbeasts. These sea serpents serve as King Orgnum's guards and occasional mounts. Local legends in Hew's Bane allege that in the latter days of the First Era, Maormeri snake magic was used on ensorcelled locks when capturing slaves to ensure that they remained docile and compliant. Maormeri ships are described as looking insectoid, with membranous sails and a rugged chitin hull, flying a markedly alien flag. Maormer use fire salts to warm their food on long voyages. Maormer sailors are nimble acrobats who excel at boarding enemy ships. The Maormer have a reputation for being adept storm mages. They have harnessed the power of water, air, and lightning to assault their enemies. Their mages also conjure Storm Atronachs, and can shape them to look like animals, such as bears and tigers. During naval battles, Maormer Sea Mages conjure winds and storms to toss their foes' ships around on the waves. The Maormer have many methods of using storm magic to obliterate their foes. They can whip up hurricanes with the intent to destroy entire fleets. They can do so with a ritual using serpent-shaped storm totems to siphon life energy from sacrifices marked with runes. Blood sacrifices such as these are only utilized when a summoner needs to rapidly accrue and release a lot of energy. The energy from the totems can be used to form powerful hurricanes, or it can be funneled into a storm atronach, which can only hold so much energy before it discorporates. Maormer mages can use wind energies to bind the creature until it performs its intended function. When it explodes, it releases a wave of energy that kills everything it touches, except for creatures with an affinity for storm energy, such as Thunderbugs. Maormer, also known as Sea Elves, Tropical Elves, Pyandoneans (or derogatorily as Fish Elves), are a race of Mer that reside on the island kingdom of Pyandonea, far south of the Summerset Isles. Similar to their Altmer cousins in build, their skin can range in tone from pearlescent white or grey blue, and Maormer Leviathans can have scales. Some Maormer have strange, chameleon-like skin that is entirely colorless, as if their flesh were made of some white limpid jelly. Some Maormer ears are more broad than those of other mer, and are flared along the outer ear like a clip point blade. Their ears are shaped in such a way that they resemble fins. Maormer eyes can be pale blue, with a faint distinction between the sclera and the iris. Their eyes can also be blank. Their tattoos are elaborate, and they tend to display a vicious demeanor towards the denizens of Tamriel. Maormer are acclimated to life on the waves, and are steady on their feet in even the roughest waters. Maormer tongues can filter saltwater and make it potable. It is believed that Maormer bones are naturally springy. capable of communicating in a variety of methods. speaks through the wind, create chimes in order to receive its message. receive dreams from the Hist. Hist Sap is a substance made out of the Hist's very spirit. When Hist Sap is licked by an Argonian, the Hist is capable of communicating with the Argonian through visions. The sap of the Hist seems to increase the combat prowess of those who drink it. Hist sap has the ability to 'alter' living organisms, which may explain the origin of the Argonians. Ingesting large quantities of Hist-Sap is often dangerous, even for Argonians. The Sap-Speakers of the Miredancer Tribe, known for communing with their Hist and ingesting large amounts of sap in the process, often suffer the effects of sap-poisoning, including \"gold tongue\" (permanent change of mouth pigmentation to a golden hue), \"bark scale\" (thickening and darkening of surface scales), and unwanted hallucinations among other symptoms. The Blackwood Company smuggled a Hist tree from Black Marsh to their headquarters in Leyawiin, and extracted the sap to exploit this. However, when consumed by non-Argonian species, the Hist sap had strong hallucinogenic properties that sent them into dangerous bloodlust, though the poor treatment of this particular tree affected the sap causing similar effects on Argonians, as well. At the end of the Third Era, a recruit of the Fighters Guild sabotaged the Hist extraction mechanism, destroying the tree in the process. The Hist are a species of giant spore trees growing in the innermost swamps of Black Marsh. Argonians are known to have deep connections with the Hist, calling themselves \"people of the root\", and licking the leaking sap of their trunks in religious rites. Others claim the trees are, in fact, a sentient race, more ancient than all the races of man and mer. Hist trees usually have red bioluminescent flowers growing out of them, but the Naga-Kur Tribe's one does have blue flowers. One tribe dedicated to ice spells have a Hist that drips with icicles and is said to be located deep within Black Marsh. The Reachmen, also known as the Reachfolk or Witchmen of High Rock, are a race of humans who are native to the Reach in southwestern Skyrim and the neighboring Western Reach in the east of High Rock. They are believed to be closely related to the Bretons and some Reachmen believe that their people originally came from High Rock. While Reachmen are distinct, they are also mixed with other races that make up Man, Mer, and even Daedra. Similarly to the Bretons, Aldmeri blood runs through their veins, which stems from the Direnni Hegemony's occupation of the Western Reach in the early First Era. pale and of slight build, taller, broader and muscular builds, distinctive red eye color. Their culture is tribal and diverse - certain clans make little use of advanced technology while some other employ Dwemer animunculi and advanced alchemy; many clans utilize hides, bones and copper to make gear, while others use properly forged weapons and armor and craft weapons and tools from materials such as dwarven metal, silver, and ebony, and even accesories from malachite. Leather and wool are traditionally used as materials for Reachfolk garments. As they are shunned by most of Nord and Breton society, they typically inhabit makeshift fortresses built into caves and ruins throughout the Reach's battle-scarred landscape. There are also some similarities in things worn by the Nedic Keptu and the Reachmen, showing that a cultural exchange might have taken place. secretive, haughty demeanor, and arrogance. The Reachmen are also infamous for their advanced hedge-magic. Some Reachman mages are known to wield magic with which they can poison or corrupt nature. They are also said to have learned to control beastfolk magic, a wild hedge-wizardry. Some Wyrd Covens, amongst them, the Hagfeather Coven, the Rimerock Wyrd, and the Markarth Sisters, are known to have close relations with the Reachmen and their magic. The Reachfolk live in scores of fractured clans, each with their own traditions and character. There is no uniform tradition among the clans, though many of them share deities and practices. Some clans are nomadic, while others settle in one place and build villages. Some people in a clan may be related to each other, and others adopt clan names to mark their allegiance. New clans are synthesized all the time as like-minded individuals come together. Sometimes they seek to settle new land or follow herds of prey, and other form to plunder and raid neighboring lands. In this way, the clans are fluid, breaking up and reforming throughout history. Many clans try to live in relative peace, though some, such as the Boneshaper Clan, are overtly hostile towards outsiders. Most clans are minor, consisting of small villages, bands of nomads, or groups of marauders that hole up in caves or old forts. However, there are larger, more prominent clans. Some clans of the Reachfolk build hunting lodges decorated with Alrabeg's imagery, and ritual huts. Reachfolk have a huge variety of body markings that are based on the clan they belong to. Each clan is led by a chief, who may be called a chieftain, speaker, elder, or king depending on the clan and who the leader is. Most Reachfolk believe that chiefs who call themselves \"kings\" are just putting on airs. The clans are many and don't agree on everything, thus it is impossible to unify the clans beneath a single power. Any clan-chief can call himself a king. In fact, there have been points in history where several chiefs have claimed the title of \"king\" for themselves simultaneously. The Reachfolk have a saying: \"anyone can be a king in the Reach, but no one is King of the Reach\". Durcorach the Black Drake never took up the title of king for this reason. The Reachfolk viewed the Longhouse Emperors as war-leaders they followed of their own volition as opposed to a uniting force that ruled over the Reach as a whole. From the Reachfolks' perspective, kneeling to a king, no matter what race they are or if they've claimed the throne of Cyrodiil, is something that weaker peoples do. Many clans live upon the shores of the Karth River, a place as harsh and uncaring as much of the rest of the Reach. Its fierce rapids veer around sharp stones, and it rides over steep cliffs that create powerful torrents. The people who rely upon the river live only if the river allows it, and its inhabitants respect it for its dangers and what it provides. The Reachfolk bathe in it, wash their clothes in it, drink from it, and cook their food with it. They regard the Karth river with respect, and at the very least, consideration. The folk who live upon the river's banks see what the river takes from them as a small price to pay for what it provides. They take from the river, and it extracts a price in return. The people of the Karth River don't blame it when it sweeps away structures and people; they accept that life near the river has its hardships, and they endure. Dirt is a part of life. The real discipline comes from wading through mud knowing that it'll be on you until you next find water. The Reachfolk have rich oral traditions and don't commit their stories to paper as scholars from most other provinces do. Many from clans who live in the wilderness are illiterate and do not care to learn. Some Reachfolk are even opposed to the idea of learning to read and write. Some Reachfolk who served the Longhouse Emperors in Cyrodiil during the Second Era encouraged their children to learn their letters. Following the fall of the Longhouse Dynasty, there was not much call for reading and writing in the Karth Valley, barring major settlements like Markarth, where such skills were more widespread. occasionally adorn their weapons with Daedric inscriptions. They also utilize glyphs. high proficiency in writing. value hard work and struggle. They hold people who regularly work with their hands or perform manual labor in high regard, and respect them more outwardly than some other cultures do. understand that hardship is inevitable, but instead of bemoaning their sorrows, they embrace the pain as wisdom. do not condone stealing from others, and theft is a very rare occurrence. Theft is considered a serious offense. punish theft severely. One of the customary punishments for such a crime is hand amputation. known to dance often and are perceived as great dancers by the outsiders. Their dances are often related to ancient rituals, complicated in nature and involve numerous clan members. Some clans value dancing skills very high. deal in bargains, respect strength, and skill, and believe in rewarding favors. Offering favor for a favor is considered one of the more common ways of how business works, and is one of the old and respected customs. When children from the Spiritblood Clan grow strong enough, they perform the Vateshran's Rites to ascend to adulthood. The rites separate the strong from those too weak to live in the Reach. If they survive the challenge, the child emerges a full warrior, and carries all the privileges and responsibilities that adulthood in the clan offers. They train their entire lives for that day, and begin their trial knowing that the Rites could kill them. To complete the Rites, a child must traverse Vateshran Hollows, a cavern filled with summoned Daedra. Reach-magic[edit][ ] Bloodthorn/Bloodroot Vine magic Reachmen are often referred to as the Witchmen of High Rock, a name given to them due to their use of dark \"Reach-magic\". It is believed that they learned much of this magic through trading with the Orsimer, their neighbors who also occupy the Wrothgarian Mountains. Another source for their magic comes from hagravens, which involves \"ecstatic ceremonial heres[ies]\", such as sacrifices, to acquire dark nature magic. Hircine is believed to be the source of where Reach-magic is drawn from. The dark magic has been outlawed within the Mages Guild, though that has not stopped the art from being widely studied. The ban is for good reason, however, as one of the most notable conjurations can be devastating. Indeed, by using Reach-magic on the remains of ritual sacrifices, one can create the bloodthirtsy, thorned, and giant twisting roots known as Bloodthorn/Bloodroot vines, which can be used to corrupt the land, or shaped into \"rough mockeries of life\". An example can be found within the Huntsman's Bloodroot Forge. The Dreadhorn Clan's hagraven shaped the vines that thrived within the Forge into Nirnblooded creatures, primal creatures comparable to those of the Bosmer's Wild Hunt, but infused with the power of Nirncrux. Transformed, these vines still hunger for blood. Molag Bal can grant a similar power to gravesingers. The name \"gravesinger\" is given to some Reachman necromancers who broker deals with Bal in exchange for the power to command the loathsome dead. Indeed, gravesingers can command corpses by planting the seeds of foul vines in their victims' bodies. Molag Bal's \"gifts\" may leave a gravesinger's body in a state of decay. Mysticism was common magical art among the mystic shamans during the Second Era. The briarheart ritual is reflective of the Reachfolk's need to become better to overcome hardships. It involves communing with Hircine to ritualistically replace the heart of a skilled Reachfolk warrior with poisoned briars. This ritual is representative of Lorkh's immortal sacrifice, which is reflected by the sacrifice of ones' own life; the end result is a warrior being resurrected as a living weapon with great strength and endurance known as a Briarheart. They will bear the suffering of constant pain to use their transformation's benefit to protect their clan. In a similar vein to Briarhearts, lycanthropy is viewed by most Reachfolk as self-sacrifice, for it is seen as more of a useful condition rather than a gift, one which one suffers with so they can better benefit their clan. Some Reach Clans however have proven to be zealous about the gift, as conflicts between them and the Viridian Wyrd coven have been reported due to them offering a cure to Lycanthropy. Leather and wool are traditionally used as materials for garments. clothing is purely functional, although the bright colors are favored. Imagery of knotwork. Sturdy leather belts are intended to last for many years. They are usually tooled with stylized images of beasts the wearer holds in high esteem. Bear, elk, wolf, and raven images are most common. shoes are sturdy and usually made from fleece-lined elk hide, secured with tough rawhide thongs. Occasionally they feature studded soles for traction in snow, ice, and steep hillsides. prefer shoes with a three-pointed shape. open-fingered hand wrappings to full gloves. often wear mittens made of hide or fleece. Occasionally studs made of carved bone are added to the gloves. prefer full gloves and occasionally adorn their fingertips with sharp metal akin to claws. pants are often made from elk and deer skin and bear intricate ornaments of animals such as wolves, ravens, elk or bears. opt for wearing kilts instead. Shoulderpieces of Reachfolk usually are purely decorative in stark contrast to their general utilitarian approach to garments. Countless different and unique patterns and decorations consisting of rib-bones, rare furs, small animal skulls, or wooden ailettes carved into fierce faces are observed among Reachfolk. Icereach coven utilize hay and twigs to add their shoulderpieces more distinctive appearance and reinforce them with tough bark and bones. Reachfolk headgear is very diverse. While most Reachfolk helmets are made from leather, they are also occasionally utilizing skulls of various animals. Antlers are a common headgear element - they are worn in order to honor Hircine. Some headgear also contain wings of the birds as well as parts of sabre cat's heads. It is also not uncommon among the Reachfolk to wear decorative horns on their foreheads. Reachfolk of Icereach wear wicker masks resembling faces with unsettling expressions and exaggerated features. Some masks sport horns and dark, soot-colored feathers, some posses hooked beaks. Bull-Heart Warriors of the Reach wear sallets made of bull's skulls during the Horned Triumph ritual. Stag-Hearts don similar sallets, but made of stag's skull instead. Crow-Heart Warriors helmets typically incorporate imagery of skulls of great predatory birds. due to common belief among the Reachfolk that mage can draw power from trophies of the hunt. Reach mages often wear skulls of the animals. In honor of legendary witch Naenra Waerr, Reach witches who pass the final test of wisdom and power set to them by a clan elder gain the privilege to craft ceremonial mask with ram horns imagery. Reachfolk with clan facepaint Reachfolk witch in typical attire made of Dwemer metal and silver wearing ceremonial headgear Dreadhorn clan use mammoth and bull skin as well as minotaur's hair as material for their attire. They adorn their clothing with imagery of bull and curling vines. Reachfolk occasionally incorporate Dwemer designs into their attire as well as materials such as Dwemer metal and silver. Timbercrow Clan is known for their light and simple garments in form of traditional loincloths. Women of the Stonetalon Clan usually are covered in heavy cloaks made of bird feathers. hairpins are occasionally crafted from malachite and adorned with animal motifs. Small beads carved from blue stone are used in courtship rituals. often wear dyed feathers with intricate carvings on their vanes. adorn their clothes with talons and small skulls of birds. wear wicker crowns. skilled in the area of body marking and tattoos. They have a huge variety of body markings that are based on the clan they belong to. generally seen as strangely beautiful, although primal and not subtle by the members of other races. Dreadhorn clan uses bull imagery in their tattoos. Death Crow tattoo, which uses the imagery of Daedric Prince Nocturnal is one of the favorite of Reach clans. Many of the Reach clans along the Karth River worship Hircine, and take wolves as their totems. Certain tattoos evoke that heritage. Reachfolk practice Ancestor Worship and have a class of story-tellers called vateshran. Their job, among other things, is to ritualistically commemorate the dead ancestors of the clan through song. Reachfolk honor their ancestors by living the life the way they did and believe that their ancestors observe them from the sky above and await reunion during which the stories of the battles their descendants fought will be exchanged. Some of the clans ritually sacrifice animals as a form of offering to the ghosts of venerated ancestors and ancient heroes. Venerated ancestors in turn are believed to communicate and occasionally share wisdom with their descendants. Although Reachfolk venerate numerous ancestors the most known ones are: Aydolan was an ancient Reachfolk storyteller and historian who created the Vateshran's Rites performed in the ancient caves of the Vateshran Hollows. Following his death he remained on the Nirn as ancestral spirit for over one thousand years to oversee the trials and guide the generations of Spiritblood. The Reachfolk believe in the existence of only two worlds; the worlds of flesh and spirit. However, the world of flesh didn't always exist. Legends speak of Lorkh having an epiphany when he visited the darkness; that what is perceived as nothingness is ripe for possibility, for he saw the potential for there being more than just the realm of spirit. And so, Lorkh approached Namira, the queen of the spirit world, seeking a place within her infinite void that he could create a realm for wayward spirits. But it was not without a cost. Lorkh sacrificed himself to create a harsh realm, one that is unforgiving and intended to teach through suffering. As a result, the Reachfolk look to less conventional gods for worship, who serve as lessons rather than beliefs. What ensured is shrouded in the allegory \"And unto the mountains they fled, for the world grew dark with shadows which sprung from the heart of Lorkh, who though greatly sundered still believed in the light of Man\". After the fall of Lorkh, Hircine became the Lord of the Arena, and took the mantle of Lorkh's creation, becoming the sovereign of the realm of flesh. He became the most prominent deity to the Reachfolk, as he took an active leadership role, and shaped them to become survivors in the harshness of Nirn. generally preferred to go naked, although a few wore clothes when outside their native land. They appear to have worshipped a god named Z'en\u2014a God of Toil\u2014 as well as Dibella, Mara, and Kynareth. It was believed that at some point of the history Kothringi venerated Clavicus Vile, before shifting to Z'en worship. Music was very important in Kothringi society. They were known to make instruments out of a variety of different materials, such as turning hollow logs into wamasu-sized drums, plucking sinew from cliffstriders to make low humming bow harps and most notable of all, their chimes known to be the Kothringi's most loved instruments. A Kothringi by the name of Baelah molded hundreds of chimes from tin and copper, hanging them from branches and striking them for their sounds. The Kothringi sometimes invited the Saxhleel for feasts and celebrations where they played their instruments for the Argonian people. It is believed that cultural exchange between Kothringi and Argonians took place. Circa 2E 582, the Bards College in Solitude came into possession of a Kothringi bugle created from the horn of a leviathan. Around the same time, the Thieves Guild also stole a sacred Kothringi shovel, believed to be a blessed instrument of Z'en, from Stormhold. Kothringi Humming Dolls were toys that featured a clever arrangement of air bladders and reeds inside and hummed when squeezed. peerless crafters, distaste for clothing. weaving strands of metal into cord in order to create stronger nautical rope. utilized throwing knives, axes and harpoons in combat. varnished sphere-scarabs as slide-beads. weaving reeds of different colors and textures into decorative mats. bog-blue jaspers. buried their dead in cairns, often adorning these burial sites with glass beads. Some glass beads were also worn, serving as wearable instruments. utilized moonstone in their artwork and handicrafts, such as their statues. Reachmen celebrate the end of the old year and the beginning of the new year. They believe that with the coming of the New Life Festival, two of Hircine's aspects come to conflict with each other. New Life marks the winter solstice, when the days begin to lengthen due to the return of the sun. Storihbeg the Man-Beast thus pursues the sun in an attempt to eat it, an effort to keep the nights longer. To prevent this, Reachmen summon Hrokkibeg the Mighty Bear to keep Storihbeg constrained and protect Magnus. Namira's Dance is a ceremony performed by Reachfolk of the Boldclaw Clan. All clansmen unite together to pay respects to Namira, goddess of death and rebirth. Some are dressed in dark colors, with black facial paint, others arrive naked, to symbolize the beginning of life. Those who are able dance together in unison. During the celebrations, human blood is spilled for Namira, yet no violence is involved. Members of the clan do various things with the collected blood. Some sweep the blood under their eyes, others press bloody handprints to the ground. Despite the presence of blood, these celebrations are joyous in nature. Faolan was ancient Reachfolk king and most known legendary hero among their kin. By the Fourth Era, a radical faction of the Reachfolk, the Forsworn, drew several parallels to the struggles of Red Eagle and his oppression under an occupying force. As such, many of them extolled his teachings and practices, looked up to him as their savior and sought his blessings. They planned to resurrect him through the ancient ritual so he can reclaim the freedom of his people and rule the Reach forevermore. Naenra Waerr was an ancient witch responsible for the creation of the Umbra Sword. Reachfolk witches who pass the final test of wisdom and power honor her by crafting masks akin to one they believe she used to wear when crafting Umbra. use plant-based stain to dye their teeth crimson in order to terrify their foes. deep blue war paint. known to utilize lye in haircare. combs made of bones. Another transformation is associated with one of Hircine's creation, the Bloodroot Forge, which is capable of turning people into Blood-Forged. They are comparable to Briarhearts, but their creation instead involves a nirncrux heartstone being used in place of a briar heart, resulting in a being that is an amalgamation of blood, nirncrux, and iron. the Winterborn. \"fire, vines, and blood\". Many clans worship Hircine, the most primal of the Daedric Princes. The top of their warrior ranks typically commune with Hircine so that they may ritualistically replace their hearts with poisoned briars, allowing them to become powerful warriors known as Briarhearts. Due to their reverence for Hircine, it is not uncommon to see lycanthropes within the Reachmen's ranks. Some Reachmen clans are known to also dedicate ceremonies to Molag Bal, Malacath, Mehrunes Dagon, of some Reachfolk clans venerate hagraven matrons, who in turn grant them knowledge of nature magic. Many other Reachfolk clans, however, fear and revile them. Following the Markarth Incident, Reachmen rebels in Skyrim became known as the Forsworn. Hagravens led splinter groups encamped in various ruins and caves across the Reach. In the Argonian language Jel, Hist saplings are referred to as Hist-Deek, mature Hists are called Hist-Dooka, and elder Hists are called Hist-Tsoko. The names of the stages of a Hist's development are also used as months within the Argonian calendar. Argonians who are hatched outside Black Marsh cannot hear the Hist. Marsh-born Argonians are capable of wielding Hist-magic, which doesn't operate on the same rules as conventional spellcraft. Hist roots stretch very far, deep into the heart of Nirn and out into distant lands. Hist sap that bleeds from Hist roots buried deep underground is known as deep sap. In Black Marsh, Argonian eggs are usually incubated in pools of Hist sap to enable the Hist to help with the hatching ritual. If the Hist's connection to the eggs is somehow broken, it will result in the swift deaths of the unborn Argonians. In Shadowfen, Argonian eggs are left in the care of the Keepers of the Shell who tend the Hatching Pools. In Murkmire, the Bright-Throat Tribe are known for their egg tending. A similar substance known as Amber Plasm is also produced by certain Hist trees. Despite its appearance, it is not Hist Sap and is instead a form of chaotic creatia from Oblivion which leaks into Mundus through the Hist like blood from a wound. Rarely, the Hist-Tsoko will mark an individual to carry out a sacred task. Those marked possess wooden skin and veins that glow amber, and the Sap-Speakers know to provide them with aid. Among the Maormer, the leviathans are the most feared. They have been described by one scholar as \"the spawn of some unholy and sorcerous coupling of Sea Elf and Sea Serpent\". They are scaly and massive, standing a head and a half over the tallest Nords when they draw themselves to their full height, which they don't often do because they carry themselves in a beastly posture. Maormer leviathans are usually hunched over, their backs bent and arced like a snake ready to strike. When they walk, their movements are akin to slithering in an uneven predatory lope. The Leviathans appear unused to using their legs on land. They move deftly in the water, and can climb effortlessly up the slippery sides of ships. They are capable of stretching their jaws out of place to swallow their prey. The Maormer breed and train a wide variety of marine predators as pets and tools for combat. The winged reef vipers are commonly trained for warfare, and can leap high out of the water to land on an enemy vessel. Sea Serpents large enough to capsize warships are also among the beasts the Maormer have domesticated for warfare. He was a native speaker of Galactic Basic Standard, and although Skywalker could not understand Shyriiwook, he had quickly learned how to read Chewbacca's moods by his tone and expression before the Battle of Yavin. After decades of missions with R2, Skywalker was reasonably fluent in droidspeak. Skywalker was adept in unarmed combat. He demonstrated his skill early on Cymoon 1 where he defeated a few stormtroopers by kicking and slamming them to the ground. - \"I know all about waiting. For my family. They'll be back, one day.\" - Rey Rey was a human female who stood at 1.7 meters and weighed 54 kilograms. She had brown hair, hazel eyes, and light skin that adapted to the extreme ultraviolet radiation emanated by the sun that shone down on the desert world of Jakku. The harsh realities of such a world could have easily made a person cynical or guarded against sympathy and weaknesses, but not Rey. Despite eking out a meager existence in the scorching heat of the Western Reaches planet, Rey possessed a heart full of generosity and a willingness to help other people in need. It was this willingness that led her to not only help BB-8 be free of Teedo's interference and Plutt's attempts to acquire the droid but also led her to help BB-8 in its mission to return the star map it carried to the Resistance. Though she never wanted to leave Jakku for fear that she would not be there when her family returned for her, she believed in the importance of the Resistance and its fight against the First Order enough that it gave her strength to continue on BB-8's mission to find Luke Skywalker and defeat the First Order. She had a stubborn, private, and self-reliant side, distrustful of fellow scavengers Devi and Strunk when they offered her help in repairing the Ghtroc 690 freighter she'd found. It was difficult to change her mind once she'd made a decision, impatiently stealing a skiff speeder to reach the remains of the Death Star on Kef Bir instead of waiting for the tides to subside, against Jannah's advice to wait. She had a tendency to try to do things alone, both out of a desire to protect her friends and her stubborn nature. Still, her friends were incredibly important to her; she considered them her newfound family. Her teachings from Organa and Skywalker guided her in her journey in the Force, and it was only when Palpatine threatened to kill her friends that she considered going along with his plans. Her duel with Kylo Ren on Starkiller Base and the other events of that time had exposed Rey to fear, aggression, and anger. These emotions could easily bring one to the dark side of the Force. Rey needed guidance, and Skywalker was the only Jedi Master in the galaxy. However, by the end of their time together, Rey had grown furious with Skywalker due to his rejection of the Jedi and his refusal to explain his role in Ben Solo's fall to the dark side. She believed that the galaxy needed the Jedi Order and was dismayed by Skywalker's rejection of his mandate as the last Jedi. As difficult as it was for Rey reconcile the legendary Jedi Master with the defeated old hermit who wanted the Jedi to end, she remained steadfast in her conviction that Skywalker was the hero that the galaxy needed. Though her journey to Ahch-To ended in disappointment for Rey, she refused to give up hope\u2014a trait which led Snoke to consider her a true Jedi in spirit, and precisely why he needed her to die. For years, Rey's imagination took her mind to other worlds, including those with lush green forests and beauty that she could never even dream of. The adventure she found while helping BB-8 and Finn brought her to one such world in the form of Takodana, where she began to realize that her destiny was not in the junkfields of a remote desert planet. Her encounter with Maz Kanata profoundly impacted how she saw herself and what she was capable of, and Rey began to see that she was part of a larger galactic fight\u2014and that the power of the Force was with her. Her recognition of these abilities and her destiny coincided with turbulence in the Cosmic Force, which for years had remained dormant, and ultimately led her to find Skywalker. The years that she spent on Jakku also proved useful when faced with Skywalker's obstinacy; having learned the value of patience, Rey remained on Ahch-To despite the old Jedi Master's refusal of her entreaty, determined to wear him down. Their time became a battle of wits, as Skywalker and Rey were equally stubborn. When she found Skywalker short on answers, Rey improvised on her own, which was what she did best. For years, Rey remained optimistic and hopeful that her parents would return for her, wearing the same hairstyle and style of clothing that she had when they'd left her in the hopes that they'd recognize her when they came back. The question of who they were haunted her while on Ahch-To, and was left with feelings of disappointment and even greater loneliness when she found no answers. She was distraught when Kylo Ren led her to believe that her parents had been mere junk traders who sold their daughter for drinking money. The truth that she was Palpatine's granddaughter, however, had an even greater effect on her. She began to believe that, as a Palpatine, she was innately evil, and attempted to isolate herself on Ahch-To as Skywalker had, for the good of the galaxy. It was only with encouragement from Skywalker, who admitted he'd been wrong, that Rey overcame this fear and joined the final battle against the First Order on Exegol. Later, after the battle was won, Rey renounced her biological heritage, choosing her new family as she renamed herself Rey Skywalker. During Rey's time on Ahch-To, Skywalker felt that she reminded him too much of himself: full of hope, impatient and reckless. Snoke preyed on those attributes, knowing that Rey could not \"resist the bait\" he had laid before her. The most important friend in Rey's life was Finn. He was the first one to genuinely care about her as a person, immediately asking if she was okay when they'd been knocked off their feet while they fled from stormtroopers at Niima Outpost. Their skills complemented each other while they flew the Millennium Falcon, and by the time they escaped Jakku, they'd begun to form a deep, unbreakable bond, starting to care immensely for one another. Rey begged Finn not to leave on Takodana, and was willing to die with the unconscious Finn on Starkiller Base as it was collapsing on itself, but were saved by Chewbacca's arrival in the Falcon. She continued to worry about him while on Ahch-To, requesting Chewbacca to give Finn a message if she didn't make it. She hugged him tightly when they were reunited on Crait, relieved to once again be with her best friend. Their sense of care and trust for each other carried them throughout their time with the Resistance, inspiring and giving each other strength. Spiritual beliefs[ ] - \"What do you know about the Force?\" \"It's a power that Jedi have that lets them control people and... make things float.\" \"Impressive. Every word in that sentence was wrong.\" - Luke Skywalker and Rey As a scavenger on Jakku, Rey had heard about the Force through stories told about the Jedi. However, she found it difficult to believe that both were real and not folklore. Though she would discover that the Force had always been within her, at the time Rey thought it was simply her \"intuition and luck\" that helped her to survive in Jakku desert. Her worldview began to change when she encountered Han Solo, who confirmed that both the Jedi and the Force existed. At first, Rey was overwhelmed by the revelation that she was connected to the Force. Though she eventually opened herself to the Force, using it to defeat Kylo Ren, her understanding of it was limited due to her lack of training. When her apprenticeship began under Luke Skywalker, Rey saw the Force only as the source of the Jedi's power, explaining that it helped them to make things \"float.\" During her first duel with Ren on Starkiller Base, Rey had experienced her first temptation to the dark side; seizing on the vengeance Rey wanted to inflict upon Ren after the death of Solo, an amorphous, unknown voice in her mind ordered her to kill him. Rey recoiled from and rejected the temptation, but it would not be the end of her struggles with darkness. With Skywalker as her mentor, Rey came to see the Force as more than the abilities it granted to individuals such as herself. As a result, her knowledge grew to include ideas, such as the Force being an energy field that surrounded everything, binding the universe together, and serving as a balance between the dark side and the light. Rey's newfound belief in the Force led her to seek out Ren despite her master's warnings; having seen his future in a vision, she believed that the Force wanted her to bring Ben Solo back to the light. The outcome of her confrontation with Ren had mixed results for Rey. While she exulted in the way he saved her by killing his master, Supreme Leader Snoke, she was dismayed by Ren's decision to rule the galaxy instead of returning to the light. She had been certain that her vision would come to pass, though Skywalker had warned her that it would not. Ultimately, this incident caused Rey to revise her understanding of the Force once more. Until then, she had treated the Force as an instrument of her will. After allowing the Force to control her actions while fighting the Praetorian Guard, Rey saw herself and Ren as instruments of the Force, and consequently discarded an opportunity to take his life while he was unconscious. In Rey's mind, Ren's fate would be decided not by herself but by the will of the Force. Rey's faith in the Force grew stronger as she studied the Jedi sacred texts that she took from Skywalker. Although she appreciated the books for their knowledge and contribution to Jedi history, Rey did not believe that they contained a universal \"truth\" about the Force. Nevertheless, she was fascinated by them and would spend countless hours reading and learning arcane techniques. A dyad in the Force[ ] - \"Look at me. Ben. When we touched I saw your future, just the shape of it, but solid and clear. You will not bow before Snoke. You will turn\u2014I'll help you. I saw it. It's your destiny.\" - Rey, to Ben Solo At first, Rey thought that Kylo Ren was a \"creature\" until she saw his face and was surprised by how young he appeared. After he killed his father, Han Solo, whom Rey regarded as a father figure, she abhorred his actions and called him a \"monster.\" Ren's presence in Rey's life caused the scavenger to experience a range of emotions, such as fear and anger, but also sympathy and compassion. She also distrusted him; though she sensed that Ren used traces of the truth in the hope of accomplishing his goals for her, Rey doubted his intentions nonetheless. Rey was terrified of Ren whom she regarded as her \"mortal enemy\" and a genuine threat to the Resistance's survival. In addition to the anger she felt towards him, Rey was infuriated by Ren's calmness towards her as well as his curiosity about the connection between them. The interactions between them affected Rey in other ways as well. At one point, she was distracted by the sight of Ren without his shirt. She also felt strange when Ren addressed her by name. Through their Force-bond, however, Rey discovered the depths of Ren's inner turmoil. The combination of her solitude and the bond caused Rey to sympathize with Ren; by then, she saw him as someone who could relate to her feelings of abandonment and isolation. As a result, she grew more relaxed around Ren, experiencing relief instead of fear when their minds were bridged. She also developed her own interest in their connection, and wondered to what degree they could interact through the Force. At first, Rey believed that Ren fell to the dark side because he failed as Skywalker's apprentice. This view changed gradually as she interacted with both members of the Skywalker family, leading Rey to consider the possibility that it was the master who failed his student. After learning the truth about the destruction of Skywalker's temple, Rey was convinced that good still existed within the fallen Jedi, and she resolved to see him return to the light as the galaxy's last hope against the dark side. Rey rejoiced when Ren killed Snoke and helped her to defeat his master's bodyguards, only to become horrified by his decision take Snoke's place as ruler of the First Order. She cared about him by then, and she wanted to join him but as Ben Solo rather than Kylo Ren. Ren's choice to remain with the dark side disappointed Rey, who rejected his offer to rule the galaxy together. Powers and abilities[ ] - \u00abRey's really something by the way. I've seen some things in my time, and she's...yeah, something's going to happen there.\u00bb - R2-D2, to BB-8 on Rey Rey honed her skills as a scavenger in the junkfields of Jakku, a planet on which every day was a struggle to survive against harsh sunlight, searing hot deserts, and cutthroat scavengers and thieves who would steal from anyone. This bleak reality, in which she nonetheless remained ever-hopeful, saw Rey develop a tenacity and instinct for survival. Her skills as a scavenger saw her earn the respect of junk traders like Plutt, who ensured that his thugs did not steal from her\u2014unless her skills got in the way of his business. The need to survive against such beings, and the ability to traverse downed star cruisers and other war technology, necessitated that she remain in peak physical condition. She developed skills as a warrior, with the ability to expertly wield a quarterstaff against those who would threaten her. Her interactions with offworlders also allowed her to learn languages from other worlds, such as the Wookiee language of Shyriiwook, Teedospeak, Ewokese, and the binary language of droids. She also had a certain talent for drawing, which she put to good use in her journal. In her time on Jakku, Rey learned the ins-and-outs of being a mechanic, and she was gifted with a seemingly innate understanding of how machinery worked. This left her comfortable around vehicles and weapons, including the AT-AT she called home; she kept the weatherproofing of the downed transport intact to protect against the climate, and she set traps around it so scavengers could not steal from her. She built her own speeder and salvaged an old computer that ran simulations flying a variety of different ships. She became a skilled pilot by constantly practicing these simulations, despite never wanting to leave Jakku. These skills proved ever-useful when she piloted the Millennium Falcon away from Jakku, and she displayed an understanding of its systems and functions with a familiarity that rivaled even that of Han Solo. Chewbacca also recognized these abilities, giving her the pilot's seat in the Millennium Falcon after Solo died and the two set off to find Skywalker. All of these skills and more were put to the test when she left Jakku with BB-8 and Finn. Rey was forced to pilot the Millennium Falcon through the Starship Graveyard, in which she formed a working partnership with Finn when the former stormtrooper manned the gun turrets of the old Corellian vessel, and further helped Solo repair the Falcon when it was damaged. Her ability to understand languages not commonly found on Jakku came in handy when helping BB-8 with its mission, as well as through interactions with Chewbacca. The adventure that followed her leaving Jakku led Rey to discover that she was gifted with the powers of the Force. Though she initially rejected these powers and the destiny that came with them, Rey's encounter with Skywalker's lightsaber began awakening the power of the Force inside of her. She resisted Kylo Ren's attempt to probe her mind for the map to Skywalker and even turned his attack back on him to discover his own fears of inadequacy in the shadow of Darth Vader. Because of this, Ren concluded that Rey was strong with the Force; untaught, but stronger than she realized. As a side effect of that mind probe, Rey inadvertently unlocked some of her dormant Force abilities by accessing memories of Ren's training which, in turn, served as her own training in the ways of the Force. She was, therefore, able to employ the mind trick, albeit only after three attempts, against a stormtrooper in order to escape from captivity, and her skills grew throughout her escape from the Starkiller. On one occasion, she was able to summon Skywalker's lightsaber to her hand and make it fling itself past Kylo. This culminated in her lightsaber duel with the injured Ren, as she was able to repel his attacks and best him in their fierce encounter, destroying his lightsaber; however, she had been only able to achieve this due to Ren's imbalance. Thereafter, Rey embraced these events and the abilities she was just beginning to learn when she sought out the exiled Skywalker, rekindling a spark of hope for a galaxy on the road to war. On Ahch-To, she was able to use the Force to run faster. After her training with Luke, Rey proved capable of lifting and moving several boulders simultaneously with a mere amount of concentration to open a passageway for the Resistance on Crait, and could also access the Force-bond forged by Snoke to communicate with Ren seemingly at will. According to Snoke, she grew more powerful in the light side of the Force as Ren grew stronger in the dark side. According to Luke Skywalker, Ren was far more powerful than Rey, but Rey's powers were quickly growing. In the few days since the Battle of Starkiller Base, she progressed from needing to attempt the mind trick several times before succeeding, to moving dozens of heavy rocks at once and she was able to match Ren in a Force-wrestle for a lightsaber. Despite her growing powers, she was unable to hold off Snoke's mind probe and was helpless against his telekinetic powers, though she previously resisted his apprentice Ren's. Due to being a Palpatine, she was inherently stronger in the dark side of the Force. Despite her lack of proper training, Rey proved a natural in lightsaber combat, albeit neither as seasoned nor as versatile as Kylo Ren, as even after he was severely injured and unbalanced due to regretting Han's death, Rey struggled to parry Ren's attacks until she tapped upon the Force to defeat him, with Luke noting that Ren's skills with a lightsaber far surpassed hers. Although after she had trained for a year, her prowess had greatly improved enough to challenge Ren in a fair fight, fighting him to a stalemate in their first duel. In their last prolonged intense duel, Rey ultimately proved to be incapable of truly matching him as she was able to compete against him for the majority of their duel. Ren eventually knocked her on the ground and disarmed her following a number of ferocious attacks. She was only able to end their fight by impaling him when he was distracted by his mother calling him through the Force. She previously struggled in fighting Snoke's Praetorian Guard, one of whom managed to wound her in the right shoulder, and though she managed to fight all of them off and kill one when fighting alongside Ren, she struggled against two of them at once and despite forcing back one of them, in both one-on-one fights she was nearly killed by a guard. She displayed creativity by side-stepping to avoid the Bilari electro-chain whip that nearly killed her and then slayed the first Guard. Upon getting restrained by the final one, Rey dropped her lightsaber to slash his unguarded leg and knock him down. After a year of training, Rey displayed noticeable skill in blast-deflection, deflecting every blaster bolt from Palpatine's Sith Royal Guards. was left in anguish due to the fact she had lost control and seemingly killed her friend. Following a year of training under Organa, Rey's light side powers became considerably more refined. Her telekinetic prowess had grew to the level where she could levitate both herself and large piles of stone into the air and was strong enough to slowly tug a prison transport that carried Chewbacca to the ground using the Force despite considerable effort, although Ren was able to hold her to a standstill using his own power. When she faced Ren, Rey blocked his lightsaber strike with the Force, which he would soon replicate on her own attack. During her fight with Palpatine's Sith Royal Guards, Rey was able to redirect some of the blaster bolts fired at her at another guard, killing them instantly, and knocked down and tossed him off the cliff with telekinesis. Additionally, Rey became capable of leaping across great distances, which she would use to avoid Ren's fighter and to avoid a tidal wave when fighting Ren for the last time. Using the Force, she was able to heal Kylo of a mortal wound, even causing the scars she had previously inflicted on him to vanish as well. Rey's lightsaber skills had vastly improved as well to the point that, bolstered by the strength of all the Jedi, she was able to block Palpatine's Force lightning with Leia Organa's lightsaber. By combining Leia's with the Skywalker lightsaber, Rey managed to reflect Palpatine's Force lightning back onto him in order to disintegrate Palpatine, destroying his throne and collapsing the chamber that they were in on top of the cultists of the Sith Eternal. the best and very expensive. a lone warrior whose past and identity were a mystery to others, and she remained battle-worn and laconic as a formidable bounty hunter, she had dark hair, brown eyes, and tan skin. A natural loner, often aloof, tight-lipped, and generally silent, rarely spoke unless spoken to, and had a tendency to let her actions speak for themselves. However, under this cold exterior, laid a much softer side. While she was ruthless and unforgiving to members of the seedy underworld, she refrained from showing this side to the innocent and helpless. This softer side was the catalyst for her bond with children. In addition to this softer side, she was also extremely loyal to those that have helped her, and never forgot her allies. She insisted to pay for his work, helped free of charge, and refused payment instead opting to assist people on goodwill alone. refused to abandon people, stated that it was against the Creed to go back on her word, and she was willing to stay even if it resulted in her death. When confronting the Mythrol, Djarin captured his target without hesitation and later froze the Mythrol upon seeing the target tinkering around in the Razor Crest. As a hunter, he was considered one of the best by Karga of the Bounty Hunters' Guild, with his skills making him the galaxy's best hunter during his era. Karga viewed Djarin as his \"most valuable partner\" following the Mandalorian's successful capture of the Child. However, Djarin never celebrated his success, choosing to continue on to the next job. despite her profession, does not care excessively about money, but sees it as a means of earning a living. shy personality towards other individuals and people she had worked with before, was the only individual to holster her gun, attempting to defuse the situation On the contrary, Djarin was close to the Tribe, and had a special interest in the foundlings, as he had been one before. He ensured that they received any of his excess beskar. He took the Creed of his tribe to heart, following its traditions and ways to the letter, most notably his utter refusal of taking off his helmet in front of others regardless of the situation. However, Djarin came to care for Grogu so much that he broke this code. Djarin was glad to have become a Mandalorian, and was notably angered to see the discarded armor of his fellow Mandalorians, determined to stay behind at the sewers and fight the Imperials as revenge. Mandalorians that did not follow the Way were not Mandalorians in his eyes. was not used to being one of those who killed in cold blood, sparing his life, showed mercy. - \"By Creed, until it is of age or reunited with its own kind, you are as its father.\" - The Armorer, to Din Djarin, regarding Grogu \u2014 Listen (file info) Grogu became one of the few beings whom Din Djarin truly bonded with, which started from the beginning of his relationship with the small alien. Despite his cold demeanor, he did not allow Grogu to be killed\u2014even when the Client allowed his termination for a smaller reward\u2014and instead destroyed IG-11 before the droid could eliminate Grogu. Throughout his time on Arvala-7, he protected Grogu from various threats, and strictly refused to sell him to a tribe of Jawas. When he finally delivered Grogu to the Client, Djarin felt remorse upon powering up the Razor Crest to depart Nevarro, and returned to the Imperial facility to rescue him, even going close to death in an encounter with the Bounty Guild by shielding the infant from laser fire. Later, he showed his care for Grogu in searching for a place where they could happily reside away from bounty hunters, and was willing to leave Grogu behind in a remote village on Sorgan for the infant's sake. When dealing with Motto, Djarin specifically requested that her pit droids stay away from his ship, but later thanked the mechanic when he saw her taking care of Grogu. Upon being reminded of the Way of the Mandalore by the Armorer, which dictated that he had to be responsible for Grogu's welfare far more than just the infant's protection, he decided to search the galaxy for Grogu's species. A strong emotional bond existed between Djarin and Grogu, which Ahsoka Tano sensed through the Force. She described Djarin as a father figure to Grogu. He considered Grogu to be his closest friend, and became his adopted father. Djarin went to great lengths to rescue Grogu after the Child was abducted by Moff Gideon, to the point of bending and breaking the rules of the Mandalorian creed that he was raised to uphold. Despite his objection to removing his helmet in public, Djarin did so before giving Grogu to Luke Skywalker, allowing the Child to see his face for the first time. Before parting ways, he promised that they would see each other again. Later, he asked the Armorer to reforge his beskar spear into an armor for Grogu. He missed Grogu, and tried to visit him during Grogu's training, but was stopped by Ahsoka Tano. has the face of a friend. A good rebel agent who held dark secrets, standing at 1.78 meters tall with brown hair, brown eyes, and light skin. striking good looks, used her handsomeness to lure in the unsuspecting during her service as a rebel spy. - \"I love what you are. What you do, how you try, kindness and your strength, a hell of a woman.\" Before becoming the Slayer, Buffy's personality was that of a superficial blonde valley girl; she herself claimed that even Cordelia \"looked like a classical philosopher next to me.\" Initially snobby towards people of a lower social class such as Pike, the isolation she experienced from her popular friends at Hemery High gave her new-found empathy towards outcasts like Willow and Xander. Nevertheless, Buffy was something of a rebel who did not conform to traditional Slayer conventions; Rupert Giles once admitted that \"some flexibility is required\" when it came to being Buffy's Watcher. Buffy also tended to venture out of the Slayer's typically supernatural jurisdiction, often dealing with crazed robots and even human criminals. Buffy was unique as a Slayer in that she refused to give up her \"normal\" life for her destiny and worked with a group of close friends who knew her identity. The spirit of the first Slayer, Sineya, once insisted to Buffy that the Slayer must work alone, a belief which Buffy promptly rejected. Buffy's individualistic and rebellious tendencies culminated in developing an extreme distaste of being manipulated and \"losing control,\" particularly when it revolved around her life. This was made most apparent in her initial request to have the monks erase her false memories of Dawn, her forced destiny as the Slayer, her brief loss of her abilities through Giles' betrayal, her rejection of Twilight, anger over Angel's decision to keep his presence hidden while in Sunnydale, as well as deciding to turn himself into a vampire again without her knowledge. Kendra, who had been trained as a Slayer from early childhood, told Buffy that a Slayer did not have the luxury of emotions. Buffy responded that her emotions gave her power and she considered them \"total assets.\" Spike once stated that Buffy's improvisational fighting style was much like that of Nikki Wood, the second Slayer he killed. Additionally, one of Buffy's most notable qualities was her frequent sarcasm and ironic sense of humor. She often cracked jokes and puns about her opponents, especially in the midst of battle. Buffy apparently took much enjoyment out of taunting them, usually getting very annoyed when her enemies didn't respond. Angel had once stated that Buffy always deployed light-hearted humor to cover up how she truly felt or to avoid uncomfortable situations, similar to Xander. Buffy had a tendency to be completely confident about her abilities when she faced her enemies. Buffy was also very stubborn, hard-headed and a natural leader, making her at times overly demanding and bossy. She was extremely determined and fiercely independent by nature, detesting giving up or losing battles of any kind, be it supernatural or personal issues. This would be especially apparent in her humiliation at running away from Glory while trying to protect Dawn. violent, \"all about control.\" somewhat short-tempered in nature, as it never took very much to irritate her. \"I am capable of awesome. I'm usually super reliable and conscientious and according to popular report, a little tightly wound.\" During her first years as a Slayer, Buffy functioned as a reluctant hero. While she constantly expressed her desire for nothing more than a normal life during her high school years, Buffy had a strong sense of responsibility to the people she could save. As time moved on, Buffy became more accepting of her Slayer duties, particularly after Kendra helped her to understand that being the Slayer was not a job, but part of who she was. After her meetings with the first Slayer and Dracula, Buffy became more interested in her role as the Slayer and dedicated to study it. After her mother's death, Buffy's determination to succeed was becoming more frayed. The constant setbacks and tragedies in her life were causing her to lose faith in herself, not going unnoticed by Giles and Xander. Dawn's capture by Glory shattered her resolve entirely, falling into a catatonic state that she was only able to pull out of because of Willow. Buffy's waning faith even reached the point that she had, just for a moment, wanted Glory to win and Dawn to die so the pressure and responsibility would be over, a thought that intensely disturbed her. Buffy's personality and character developed a much darker and self-destructive persona after being brought back from Heaven. She had hated living and the harshness of everything her life had, even attempting to commit suicide at one point until stopped by Spike, with whom she had sought out a violent sexual relationship, later admitting that she didn't love him and was just using him to feel something. However, after the death of Tara and Willow's subsequent dark magic-fueled rampage, Buffy realized that life was worth living. While Buffy acknowledged that humans can be just as bad as demons, if not even worse, she largely refused to kill humans, insisting that the Slayer did not have a license to kill, which occasionally put her into conflict with her less-merciful teammates. She held disgust and hatred of collateral damage as she had always tried to save as many people as she could by any means necessary, even if a solution to save the world was killing someone innocent (a striking difference from her ex-boyfriend Angel, who had employed \"ends justified the means\" tactics in the past). For example, she spared Ben's life after Glory was defeated despite full knowledge that Glory would eventually resurface and come after her again, which resulted in Giles doing so instead; she flat-out refused to even consider killing Dawn to stop Glory's plans, however, she eventually told Giles two years later that, with what she knew then, she would allow her to die. Additionally, she refused to kill Warren Mears despite his vicious crimes, including Tara's murder, preferring to let him face human justice, whereas Xander and Dawn were so disgusted and furious with him that they openly supported Willow's intent to kill \u2014 until after she actually did it and then targeted Andrew and Jonathan, who had nothing to do with Tara's death. However, throughout her focus of the Slayer mission, she stated that she would be able to kill a human to save the world; indeed, Buffy had made exceptions to her rule of not killing humans: she was apparently willing to kill Faith to save Angel's life, killed several members of the Knights of Byzantium to protect Dawn, and bisected Caleb with the Scythe. Nonetheless, she made it a rule in the Slayer Organization to \"go for the wound\" with their human enemies. Additionally, Buffy fully understood that not all demons were evil and was in fact good friends with several demons, such as Clem, and held a code of honor even with longtime enemies, refusing to kill Spike when he was rendered helpless by the Initiative's Behavior-Modification Circuitry despite their long history of animosity before and after that point, while also being disgusted with Riley when he expressed prejudice against Willow for dating Oz, a werewolf. Despite this, Buffy was perfectly willing and able to kill demons when they committed bad deeds, and while not speciesist per se, when Anya, having become a vengeance demon again, killed several fraternity boys in accordance with a wish and visibly regretted, showing obvious morals and humanity, Buffy decided right then and there that she had to kill Anya rather than talk her down or find other options like they did with Dark Willow, who was in fact evil and trying to end the world out of nothing more than hatred and spite, justifying it by stating that Willow was a human and Anya was a demon, and reminding Xander that she killed Angel because it was necessary, stating that as the Slayer, she was the law and her judgment on demons was absolute. However, Buffy did not consider nor act as if Slayers were the law or above it in human matters. Though she was normally quite aware socially, Buffy had proven to have a few lapses in judgment that cost her and others as well. Her destructive relationship with Spike, for example, was attributed to her own feelings of vulnerability, self-loathing, and unworthiness after the death of her mother as well as her abrupt descent from Heaven. Despite her powerful sense of responsibility, when in a state of depression or ill humor, she had been shown to procrastinate and put off or otherwise ignore things she should be dealing with. This was most prominently seen in her exile out of Heaven, ignoring her role as guardian of Dawn and forcing Giles to both take care of her and pay the bills she couldn't afford. Another example was when she had smashed the Seed of Wonder and remained indifferent over Willow's pleas of returning magic, hardly thinking of the consequences of the action because she did what she had to do; in this case, she was finally forced to face the negative consequences of the Seed's destruction when she discovered that without magic, Dawn was fading away. Buffy was also seen to have an \"inferiority and superiority\" complex, as she felt like she was worse than everyone or that there was something wrong with her, and that even though her friends and former boyfriends think the opposite, their opinions didn't mean anything. She could also be surprisingly negative and give in to fits of pessimistic tendencies, suffering from occasional abandonment issues since almost all her friends and boyfriends had left her at some point. She suffered from constant loneliness, especially since she felt the burden of being the Slayer was something no one could understand or share with her. Buffy had once admitted that she cut people out, of both her problems and personal feelings for years, coming to the conclusion that she was closed off from everyone else. Fearing her attachment to reality was disconnecting, Buffy wondered if being the Slayer would eventually overcome her so much, she'd be too hardened to be able to love anymore. However, Buffy's increasingly closed off demeanor over the years was a combination of the harsh lifestyle of a slayer and her chronic habit to be strong for everyone else despite her own problems. responded poorly to authority, advanced sense of awareness One of Buffy's most defining personality traits was her tendency to keep things secret from the rest of the Scooby Gang, which came back to haunt her more than once. Such secrets included Angel's resurrection, Dawn's identity as the Key, her relationship with Spike, and her sighting of Spike in the basement of the new Sunnydale High. Buffy had a tendency to mangle the names of vampires, demon species, and mystical terminology, much to Giles' constant irritation. For example, \"astral body\" She mispronounced as well even some words unrelated to the supernatural, such as \"Haberdashery,\" which became \"Haerbradasgrening,\" \"Habbledaspery,\" and \"Have-a-dash-of-tea.\" She often displayed poor driving skills. She repeatedly asked her mother if she could take lessons, to little avail. When she finally did get behind the wheel, she didn't know what the hand brake was for. She later admitted that \"drive and Buffy are unmixy things.\" She also drove while in Faith's body, again badly (although this could be because she was being chased by assassins at the time and was trying to get away). Still later, she was shown to still have possession of Joyce's SUV, but was still characteristically terrible at driving and parking it. Strangely, however, she was shown driving at one point and did so perfectly. Buffy also tended to unconsciously babble out almost senseless sentences when she was emotional or nervous (much to the dismay, amusement or confusion of others). Angel and Willow had fondly discussed this aspect of hers, both agreeing that when Buffy was emotionally excited or worked up, it's hard to get a word in. Giles also had once described Buffy as willful, insolent, and that she abused the English language terribly Buffy later admitted to having this trait, when briefly transported to the future. Buffy also spoke in strange phrases and tangents, similar to Willow, which could confuse others, especially Giles at one point. Buffy had a strong distaste towards the use of conventional firearms largely to their ineffectiveness against most demons, with Tara's death by Warren's stray bullet only reinforcing her dislike. When a police officer intervened while she fought a M'Fashnik demon, Buffy chucked his pistol away, telling him: \"These things, never helpful.\" Months later, when given a machine gun and was unable the aim it properly, Buffy rephrased: \"These things, never useful.\" When she was hold at gun point after sword fighting Simone, Buffy declared: \"I really don't like guns.\" During a war against human soldiers, Buffy stuck by her \"Slayers don't use guns\" philosophy after Giles brought her a Chinese assault rifle. When she saw Xander carrying his own gun, she told him: \"I don't like [guns]. They keep killing my friends.\" Buffy's dislike apparently distinguished lethal guns, as she employed the use of a tranquilizer rifle to sedate Oz while he was in wolf form. Buffy's most common weapon over time was shown to be frequently identified as the traditional wooden stake, even being completely unbothered with using it on creatures other than vampires. When probed of this habit, Buffy would simply say it was because she knew how to use it. Buffy had fixations on the singer Gavin Rossdale, and the actors James Spader, Daniel Craig, and Christian Bale. She liked bubblegum, chewing gum, cola, lollipops, popcorn, cheese, Ice Capades, and the reality TV show The Bachelor. During her crush on Ford, she listened to the song \"I Touch Myself\" by the Divinyls. Buffy admitted to finding puppets creepy and that they gave her \"a wig.\" Buffy was arguably the most powerful and successful Slayer to have existed, as seen through her long-Slayer lived-life and numerous victories. A contributing factor to this was the emotional connections she formed, thus increasing her will to live which is in contrast to previous slayers who were disconnected from everyone, giving them little to live for. As a Slayer, Buffy had the normal powers that came with the role, including superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, durability, accelerated healing, and the following: - Physical combat \u2014 As with every Slayer, Buffy possessed a natural proficiency with virtually all forms of weaponry and unarmed combat styles, and in addition to this she had years of combat training to hone in her skills using various martial arts (particularly jiu jitsu and aikido). Buffy tended towards a more improvisational approach to fighting, utilizing her emotions and anything in her environment that could help best her enemy. Her insistence to \"go with the flow\" during fights was sometimes looked down upon by others who considered her technique too \"sloppy,\" but Buffy believed this gave her the upper hand. Even without her Slayer powers, Buffy retained her fighting skills and years of training; when temporarily stripped of her powers in the Supernatural Crisis Act, she was able to take on a human MMA fighter and defeat him. - Senses \u2014 Slayers possessed a heightened awareness of their surroundings, allowing them, with experience, to know the position of an attacker and fight them blindfolded or in the dark. As example of this, Buffy was able to pinpoint the position of invisible Marcie Ross by standing silently for a few seconds before landing a perfect punch; throw a ball at Giles after being spun while blindfolded; and sensed a trio of invisible demons quietly entering the room, alerted just in time to turn around and block an attack. However, Buffy never fully developed the Slayer power to sense supernatural activity, not knowing Angel and Willow were vampires until they revealed their demonic visage. Buffy normally relying on her wits to discern demons and vampires from humans, such as dated clothing indicating an immortal creature. - Psychic link \u2014 This link collected the memories of all past Slayers, experiences helped hone their skills and aid them in future battles. It allowed as well communication between coexisting Slayers through dreams, as Buffy and Faith shared several dreams when Faith was in a coma, providing the first cryptic reference to Dawn's arrival and Buffy's own death. Intellect. frequently showed herself to be quite intelligent, possessing strong leadership skills and having a natural flair for tactical planning, near-perfect S.A.T. score, her quick deduction of someone's true nature, her rapid deduction based on weeks of evidence. mystical protection. extensive knowledge of hand to hand combat and spells. strength, speed, agility, and reflexes. I have sworn to protect this sorry world and sometimes that means saying and doing things that... other people can't. What they shouldn't have to. As the Watcher, librarian, and general authority/father figure, Giles frequently delivered exposition. Giles was often portrayed as somewhat of a \"straight man\" and his \"stuffy\" Oxford sensibility served as a counterpoint to the stereotypical Southern Californian characters and setting. According to Willow, he made a \"weird cluck-cluck sound with his tongue\" when he was angry but was \"too English to say anything.\" Giles was well-known for wearing tweed clothes, so much so that the Scoobies joked that even his diapers were made from the material. However, he wore non-tweed suits and even casual clothes more often after his retirement from the library. A good deal of humor came from Giles contradicting his established prim and proper image. Giles was also a talented singer and guitar player. Giles was a fan of 60's rock band Cream, The Who, Lynyrd Skynyrd, David Bowie, The Velvet Underground, and The Bay City Rollers. He also enjoys celebrating Halloween, which Buffy was surprised to learn. At times, he also proved to be arrogant and somewhat of a liar: when explaining how he survived being attacked by a Bringer in Robson's flat, he initially stated that it was the instinct that saved him, but later admitted that he simply heard the Bringer's shoes squeaking. was not what one would call technology-savvy, somewhat technophobic, aversion to technology. had a tendency to take off her glasses and wipe them during situations, this was her way of avoiding having to see the activities of others. Very few people called her by her first name Although seen early on as purely present to be her adviser and trainer, Giles developed a very close almost father-daughter relationship with Buffy, who lacked a father figure because of her own father not being around for her since she was called. One thing that definitely separated Giles from most Watchers was his compassion; while most Watchers were ruthless and fanatically devoted to their mission to the extent that they were willing to sacrifice people and perform unethical deeds, Giles truly did care for Buffy and her friends, to the extent that he defied the rules of the Cruciamentum to save Buffy's life. Giles had also shown a willingness to commit more questionable actions than the rest of the Scoobies could condone, such as secretly killing the human Ben in order to prevent Glory from returning. His personality also became darker over the years with insights into his past actions. He once reverted to his teenage personality of \"Ripper,\" a violent criminal. He was also shown to have meddled in dark magics which got a friend of his killed. He was not above using violence to solve problems, such as coercing Principal Snyder to get Buffy readmitted to school and hurting Ethan in order to know to revert a curse. \"Knowledge is the ultimate weapon.\" Giles had immense knowledge of demonology and Slayer combat (including at least a theoretical knowledge of Jujutsu and Aikido, but excelling at the art of fencing), mainly due to his training as a Watcher. While he had no enhanced supernatural powers of his own, his extensive experience in dealing with vampires, demons, and other creatures made him capable of handling them effectively. His youthful interest in witchcraft and sorcery had endured into his adult life, granting him knowledge of a wide variety of spells. Giles was proficient in several languages, including Latin, ancient Greek, Sumerian, Japanese, and possibly Gaelic, but weak in German, Mandarin, and Cantonese. moderate skill in hand-to-hand combat, as well as sword fighting. demeanor was typically mild and polite, not above using raw violence to solve a problem. calm demeanor and professionalism also offered her a detached state of authority even in the face of fearsome people, able to quickly hot-wire a car. natural acumen and intelligence made her quite formidable, inventive. always knows what to say, when she bothers to talk. Oz was well known for his detached and collected demeanor and ironic approach to life, masking a deeply philosophical interior. For example, he took the existence of the supernatural in stride, remarking that it \"explained a lot,\" and reacted to the sight of a massive submarine teleporting outside of his monastery with a simple \"Huh.\" Oz also had a characteristic and smooth sense of humor, being witty and intellectual. As noted by Xander, Oz tended to express himself in short, non-committal phrases. He approached life and situations rather eccentrically, once informing Willow that he would later ask her out on a date and asking what she would think of that, despite claiming he was unsure and nervous about it. Buffy claimed that Oz had a \"trademark stoicism.\" When it came to him being a werewolf, Oz took this seriously and was very prudent about the risk he posed to others and how it affected him. He asked the Slayer Faith about her position on dealing with werewolves while she was reminiscing about her own enjoyment from slaying. His love for Willow led him to leaving her and abandoning college to seek out a cure. typically wore t-shirts underneath a bowling shirt, jeans and black boots, wore sneakers, baggy pants and a sheepskin jacket when outside. ear piercings, studded bracelets and sported black painted nails. saffron colored monk's robes and sandals.

She understood next to nothing about it, causing her to feel lonely. She began to try to fit in in the world with great difficulty but began to get used to it. initially emotionless and uncaring, as well as ruthless to those who stood in her way. Because of her lack of emotions, she did not understand human notions like love or loyalty for the longest time. Despite her unemotional nature, she was shown to have the ability to care about others. She had an eccentric curiosity and desire to understand human ways, even though it was seen difficult for her to do so. unpredictable and at times emotionally unstable. While she did had occasional instability, she was often seen composed and collected. One of her more notable traits was her distinct, precise speech pattern. had a wide vocabulary of large words uncommon in everyday language. had a love for violence and never shied from a confrontation, making her be very overconfident. shown to almost never be afraid and when she was severely beaten, she reacted with anger and humiliation, as it had wounded her pride. did have a proud, arrogant nature which was why she never took a loss in battle well. She also tended to go into gory detail on how she would kill someone or something, which was often unsettling and disturbing to those around her. eventually expressed a desire to be \"good\" and help others, wanting to become a hero and champion in her own way. Since becoming accustomed to her current situation, she had shown a greater capacity for having concern and respect for others and their well-being. She had since gotten in touch with her humanity and formed strong bonds with a good number of individuals. Her superiority complex had diminished significantly, allowing her to work well with others. Her eccentricities were still evident as she whisked Buffy away from her current location to introduce her to the Magic Council, somewhat disregarding whatever situation would arise when she did so. This had been evidenced by her eventual exploits in the Council she belonged to. Working with the likes of Buffy to fight the growing threat of the Siphon, as well as working to protect the universe from being torn apart by the Siphon's plans, despite her depowered form, alongside Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Koh.[citation needed] Finally, her decision to stay by Severin's side as he attempted to empower the new Seed of Wonder, allowing Willow and the others the opportunity to escape whatever consequence would occur, exhibited a strong degree of compassion on Illyria's part, known to be merciless and violent in the days of old.=-[-=] - she can hit like a Mack truck, and, possibly talk to plants. could move incredibly quickly. She could also dodge attacks with perfectly-timed maneuvers - Durability: Her skin was a hardened shell, providing her superhuman durability and stamina. Even before gaining an armor, she was capable of withstanding blows from forged weapons, such as swords or axes. Wesley hit her over the head with an axe and it smashed to pieces while she barely flinched. According to Wesley, a \"whole lot of bullets\" would be needed to temporarily incapacitate her. However, Illyria was seen withstanding bullets shots from a SWAT team without being affected by it. Illyria was hit by a moving car which was massively damage upon impact, while Illyria's body barely recoiled. She was also unharmed by a truck thrown at her. Her invulnerability was extremely powerful that even in her diminished state Illyria was able to withstand a powerful blast of fire fired to her by the dragon Cordelia. - Heightened perception and awareness, - Shapeshifting: Illyria could alter her appearance on a basic level, and she was capable of recreating Fred's persona accurately enough to fool both Roger and Trish Burkle.

Her hair, although changing in tone, haircut, and hairstyle through the years in accord to fashion and mood, was naturally and constantly blond. Buffy's other distinguishing features included a bite-mark scar on the right side of her neck. She originally received this scar from the Master, but since then was bitten by other vampires: Angel, Dracula, and Spike. This was a recognizable fact among other Slayers and demons alike, enough to be a requisite to her decoys. Notably, Buffy received a tattoo of the Mark of Eyghon from Ethan Rayne, but later spent her allowance to have it removed. Younger days[ ] As a young man, Andor kept his origins close to his chest, officially denoting that he hailed from the planet Fest instead of revealing the true nature of his childhood on Kenari. However, he did trust some close friends and romantic partners with the truth, including Bix Caleen. He did not tell many, but he also did not keep track of everyone that he told. He was prone to owing various individuals money, at one point being in debt to Nurchi and Brasso, the latter of whom he was more keen to pay back due to being good friends with the man. He also had a reputation of being something of a womanizer: When trying to explain away a mysterious injury to Caleen, the latter wondered if it may have been caused by a jealous husband. When Andor's mother Maarva was trying to figure out who knew that Andor was born on Kenari, she stated that she was worried about \"all his women\", naming some of them before admitting that there were some names that even she didn't know. Arvel Skeen was quick to inform Andor that their fellow Aldhani rebel infiltration team member Cinta Kaz was already \"sharing a blanket\". Andor eventually developed into a selfless man, which set him apart from other, more extreme rebels who blurred the same lines as him. Rebel agent[ ] As a Rebel, Andor was a committed, steady, practical, and by-the-book intelligence officer with a fair amount of combat experience, but that experience grew from missions that sometimes blurred the line between what was morally wrong or right. Despite his selflessness, he was cold and distant to others. Andor often kept quiet and reserved, a trait he had acquired due to his experience in war. Although fighting on the side of the Rebel Alliance, he'd been hardened by war to the point that he did not hesitate to commit morally questionable acts when necessary. During the days of the early rebel movement, he relied on the excuse that he was following orders to justify what he had done. Although he displayed some degree of remorse and regret after some of his actions, such as he chose to execute Tivik during the mission to the Ring of Kafrene, it was never enough to convince him to seek redemption until his adventure with Jyn Erso. Nevertheless, he was more morally conflicted than fellow insurgent Saw Gerrera, who also went to great lengths to uncover intelligence on topics, particularly weapons, that threatened the Rebels. In a briefing to Mothma, General Draven described Andor as \"one of the most capable agents within Rebel Intelligence,\" with the ability to handle a wide range of missions, from reconnaissance to assassination and sabotage. Draven also said that Andor was capable of analyzing intelligence and acting on that intelligence without the need to contact superiors. Draven indicated that, since Andor worked for the rebellion since childhood, that the Alliance was like his family and that his loyalty was unwavering. Mothma, however, worried about the terrible things Andor and other Rebel agents were asked to do in the name of the Rebellion. Indeed, many of the missions he carried out for the Alliance were morally questionable. Mothma wondered if the command was doing enough to help agents like Andor to cope with the psychological damage inflicted by their actions. Comprising on their morals in the name of victory was dreadful for the emotional health of Rebels like Andor. In truth, Andor had been driven to the extremes he carried out by the anguish he carried inside him. Having lost everything in his life, Andor was able to hold back thinking about his morally questionable actions until his time with Erso. Whether it was due to killing Tivik or a change in his outlook due to the adventure he had with Erso, he disobeyed orders to kill Galen Erso before revealing his internal anguish by arguing with Jyn; she compared him to a stormtrooper for following orders he thought were wrong, which made him burst out in anger because of all he had done in the name of rebellion. In the end, Andor's selflessness and regret for his past actions led to him joining the ragtag Rogue One mission. Meeting Erso and joining that mission helped Andor remember why he became a Rebel agent in the first place. Paying the ultimate sacrifice he could in the apogee of his selfless devotion to the Rebel Alliance and wanting to bring a new hope to the galaxy, Andor willingly gave his life to ensure the Death Star plans were given to those who could use them to win the war. - \"He can pilot. He can shoot. He can lie. He speaks Alarin, Myo, Nari. He's got steady nerves and isn't afraid to kill.\" used espionage, sabotage, and assassinations, committed soldier and fighter, rebelling against various regimes over the course of his life. Although sometimes he questioned his actions, he accepted that he did what had to be done in the name of a good cause. He was prepared to double-cross allies to get the job done. an unassuming man that his opponents would underestimate. - never knew the effect she had on others\u2014never realized the intensity of her own humanity or the presence she brought to a room. troubled and quarrelsome; she was also impossible to ignore or forget.\" Standing at 1.6 meters in height, Jyn Erso was a human female with short brown hair, green eyes, and light skin, rebellious attitude but had a clear sense of right and wrong, developing her fighting skills and gaining a keen knowledge of the underworld. sacrificed herself for their cause. wielded a calm yet cold demeanor in interactions with others or when completing tasks. That being said, the pain she held on to, aggressive and distrusting, keeping others at arms length until the battle at Scarif. Despite her aggressive and cold demeanor, she showed herself to be selfless and caring The Litany is as follows: - \"I must not fear. - Fear is the mind-killer. - Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. - I will face my fear. - I will permit it to pass over me and through me. - And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path. - Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.\" Jyn's relationship with Andor was complicated, as the two didn't trust one another when they first met. After learning that the Alliance ordered him to kill Galen, she became furious with him for lying to her. However, later she learned of his experience from the war, and the two would later become respectful allies once they banded together to disobey orders and headed to Scarif to finish her father's mission. Her relationship with K-2SO was distasteful, with the latter having restrained her when she attacked the squad that was sent to rescue her. Despite this, K-2SO showed himself to care for Jyn, saying he would do anything for her, and sacrificing himself for her and Andor in his last moments. After witnessing IG-11 protect the infant with his life, however, Djarin's outlook on him changed, and he allowed the droid to take off the Mandalorian's helmet and heal his head injury. He was saddened when IG-11 chose to sacrifice himself for Grogu's safety. Following these events, his dislike of droids in general lessened; the brief friendship he had developed with IG-11 greatly improved his outlook on the mechanical beings. In fact, he even allowed Motto's DUM-series pit droids to conduct repairs on the Razor Crest, although Motto ordered her droids to be careful, believing Djarin only barely trusted automatons. Later, when he constructed his N-1 starfighter with Motto, he allowed her droids to help them, and cooperated with her BD unit. When he searched for Grogu in Luke's academy, he called R2-D2 a \"friend\". Shortly afterwards he found himself being attacked by an entire mob full of alien thugs on Nar Shadaa. Skywalker defeated numerous of the attackers unarmed before igniting his lightsaber and startling the rest. He found himself in another similar situation on Horox III, where he defeated an entire cantina of alien thugs with the help of Aphra and her Wookiee bounty hunter. Skywalker knocked out the Commander Kanchar, a hulking cybernetic enhanced man with a single punch after outsmarting him. In his later years, Skywalker displayed such skill that he was able to easily punch aside a Knight of Ren and disarm Rey of her quarterstaff before she could react. In the end, Skywalker willingly sacrificed himself for the Jedi to be revived and the Resistance to live on. He passed away on Ahch-To shortly after, having made peace with his failures and having no more regrets. During his exile on Tatooine, Kenboi was forced to engage in self-reflection that he described as agonizing. Over the years, he was forced to dismantle systemic rituals and ingrained doctrines he had experienced during his time with the Jedi. He was left broken and unwilling to fight until his rematches with Vader ten years after Order 66, which left him with the belief that his friend had been destroyed by Vader. While he once blamed himself for Skywalker's fall, Kenobi, after hearing Vader's proclamation, had come to believe that, while he and Jinn did have some blame, Skywalker had made his own choices and thus was at fault for his own fate. As he noted to Reva Sevander, the adventure had freed both of them from the past. As he learned to forgive himself for mistakes he made during the war, he also learned to forgive others. Neverthless, despite finding himself unable to call Vader by his old name during their final duel on the Death Star, he did ponder if Anakin Skywalker still remained within, but he later claimed to Luke that Anakin was truly gone. Luke proved him wrong when he redeemed his father, enabling Kenobi and Skywalker to renew their friendship as Force spirits. He understood many languages, including Galactic Basic Standard, Twi'leki, the Amani language, Felucia's tribal language, Old Alderaanian, and Shyriiwook. Though he admitted his skills were \"rusty,\" Kenobi could read hand signals accurately enough to understand Eeth Koth's message to his location at the Saleucami system. As the new head of HYDRA, having killed Kara and lost all connections to the team, Ward had effectively severed all ties to his humanity and whatever form of conscience he retained before had been erased. Now his only goal was to make S.H.I.E.L.D. and Coulson suffer as much as he had. Presumably because of this campaign to rebuild HYDRA, Ward had also become more arrogant and narcissistic. He was dismissive of the previous generation of HYDRA, believing their greed was what led to the organization's collapse. When he recruited Werner von Strucker, he assumed that after one act of savagery that the boy could murder Andrew Garner, an act that caused Gideon Malick to chastise him. Even with his dark personality, Ward cared deeply for his younger brother, Thomas; after fifteen years separated, Grant still loved him. When Coulson had Hunter point a gun to Thomas's head, Grant swore that he would cut Fitz from head to toe if they hurt him. Ward realized his life had gained a purpose during his mission to bring Hive back to Earth as Gideon Malick's second in command of HYDRA. He reflected on how he lived his life, how he joined HYDRA and what his motives were for it, from a father figure, to vengeance, to closure. After looking back and thinking of how things were at that point, and that the fact he was chosen for this mission, he felt that for the first time, that his life was important for something. He actually felt loyal to the HYDRA organization rather than any individual HYDRA operative, and even spoke the words \"Hail HYDRA\" as a way of accepting his purpose. Almost glad to be dead, relentless, secretly wished to end her pain and suffering, ready to be killed, strong, rage inside, a real man. - Combat, top grades.\" - Master Martial Artist: Ward was an extremely skilled and formidable hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist, with extensive training from S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA. Maria Hill evaluated his fighting abilities with the highest available marks for S.H.I.E.L.D.'s standards, and able to match the agency's best fighters. His fighting style consisted of many martial arts including Boxing, Karate, Eskrima, Krav Maga, Jiu-jitsu and Jeet Kune Do. Daniel Whitehall considered him to be one of the best killers. Ward often used this skill to take down many opponents at the same time, whether security or other S.H.I.E.L.D agents. He managed to defeat multiple opponents whose strength surpassed his, even defeating the enhanced Centipede Soldiers. Ward is also able to quickly use his surroundings to his advantage and use random items as improvised weaponry. The finest soldier ever made. - Master Marksman: Ward was an extremely accurate marksman skilled in sharpshooting and sniping. John Garrett recommended Ward to take this course in S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy after Ward spent time in the woods using this skill to hunt for food. Ward has famously made a shot from over a thousand yards; but Ward said it was two thousand. Using I.C.E.R.s, he was able to easily neutralize a room full of Ian Quinn's security forces and shoot multiple armed S.H.I.E.L.D. agents at once. He was also able to shoot Rosalind Price from an incredibly long distance, aiming accurately at her neck in order to let her die slowly in front of Phil Coulson. Ward displayed his superb precision when he shot Mike Peterson in the forehead with the Night-Night Gun and fought his way out of an ambush by Gideon Malick's men with nothing but a pistol. Highest marks in espionage. - Master Spy: Ward was an extremely proficient agent trained in espionage, stealth, disguise and infiltration. He has spent years on some missions as an undercover agent. When taking a Lie Detector test, Ward put splinters of cable wire into his fingers to confuse the sensors. Infamously, Ward used this skill to infiltrate S.H.I.E.L.D. as a HYDRA operative, spending years gaining trust and respect. When questioned by Raina, he explained to her methods that he used to solidify his place on Coulson's Team. Ward's willpower and strength of mind were such that he was capable of briefly resisting Lorelei's enthralling. - \"I didn't give up on you.\"\"I didn't ask for that.\"\"You didn't have to, because that's what friends do for each other.\" - Deke Shaw and Alphonso Mackenzie[src] Shaw is intelligent and useful, though he is initially considered untrustworthy. He did care for the people of the Lighthouse, as the risk that Daisy Johnson made to save Jemma Simmons could have resulted in mass murder by the Kree in retaliation. He is somewhat selfish, as his payment for Johnson was extremely difficult for him to give up. However, his desire to find his father on Earth drove him to help the team. His past could reflect his efforts to avoid ending up like his parents, though it is evident that he cared for them dearly. Though seemingly always looking out for himself, Shaw was close friends with fellow Lighthouse resident Tess and was happy to know that she was still alive after hearing she was dead. At first, Shaw saw S.H.I.E.L.D. as a burden and was willing to sell them out to survive. However, after spending enough time with them, and seeing what his parents believed in, Shaw had come to think of them as friends and to an extent, family. The team had enough of an impact on Shaw, that he gave up most of his survival instincts and was willing to give his life to send them back to the past. Shaw has a great deal of respect for Phil Coulson, as he was saddened to know of Coulson's illness and followed all of his orders, even when he didn't agree with them, without question. During Shaw's time with S.H.I.E.L.D., he had come to admire the relationship they had and how they were willing to die for one another, as the only thing he witnessed was people willing to kill for each other. In a massive departure from the person he was in his original timeline while living in the Kree-ruled Lighthouse, Shaw has grown to become immensely loyal to the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. As such, when he and Mackenzie were stranded in 1982, Shaw never gave up on Alphonso Mackenzie even though the latter became reclusive and refused to see him, ensuring that he did not need anything, praising Mackenzie's skills to the Deke Squad and constantly reminding that he would be there for Mackenzie if he needed to talk, as he could perfectly empathize with his situation. After arriving in the past, Shaw immediately fell in love with life there, becoming \"addicted\" to Zima, and being fascinated by everything the past had to offer. Because of his fascination for the customs and cultures on Earth, Shaw sometimes came off as immature and annoying. However, Shaw shows a disliking of any form of insect. This could remind him of the Vrellnexians in the future. Despite his love of life in the past, Shaw still has a hard time figuring out where he belonged. Feeling as though he did not fit in with S.H.I.E.L.D. and was not as restrained to the Lighthouse as he was in the future, Shaw eventually decided to leave the Lighthouse and S.H.I.E.L.D. as he wanted to explore Earth. Indeed, underneath Shaw's goofy exterior lied someone who just wanted to be accepted. He started a tech company to prove himself to everyone but felt like it still wasn't enough. It has been shown that despite feeling close to S.H.I.E.L.D., he harbored deep anger towards them for the lack of respect they give him despite all he's done and felt glee when Mackenzie finally accepted him as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. Shaw has deep love for his family, caring for both his parents deeply. After learning that Jemma Simmons and Leo Fitz were his grandparents, Shaw expressed the desire to keep them alive. As if they were to be killed, Shaw would no longer exist. While the act seemed selfish to Fitz, Shaw has shown genuine care for his grandparents. He saw much of his mother in Simmons and did everything he could to impress Fitz. Even with all their bickering, Shaw has strong feelings for Johnson and has shown he cares about her feelings, deciding not to express his feelings to her when he learned she was still in love with her late boyfriend. Despite dating Sequoia a year later, Shaw was still in love with Johnson. He accepted that she had developed a relationship with Daniel Sousa and decided to be left in a different timeline than hers to make sure that Johnson and Sousa would remain together, as he simply wanted her to be happy. S.H.I.E.L.D.'s influence on Shaw has become quite significant, as shown when he couldn't kill Wilfred Malick. When faced with the idea of killing one man to save thousands of lives, Shaw found he couldn't bring himself to take Malick's life. As in comparison to the man the team had first met in 2091, who would not have hesitated to do what he thought was right, even if it meant killing. Johnson brought up that Shaw used to make tough calls like this in his time, but he told her that he didn't want to return to that person they first met, to which she understood. Shaw's opinion on the subject quickly changed when he saw what Malick had become in 1955. When he learned the Chronicoms had changed the course of Malick's life, letting him live an extra six years, Shaw had no qualms in killing him in cold blood a second time, defending his actions as restoring the timeline. Shaw's wish to find a place where he belonged finally came true after being stuck in the 1980s. He found he was best suited to live in this era and was willingly to stay behind to get his teammates a chance to get back to the original timeline. However, after being separated from the only family he ever had, Shaw was initially upset, but when the remaining agents of a dismantled S.H.I.E.L.D. looked to him for leadership, he happily accepted the burden as the new Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Smart. Genius-level intellect. Shaw possessed an intelligence that far succeeded that of anyone else in the Lighthouse of 2091. He inherited his intelligence from his grandparents, Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons, who were two of the smartest agents in S.H.I.E.L.D., and, sometimes, even surpassed them in solving a scientific problem. Even when Shaw can be seen as incompetent by his peers, he is able to adapt to any new situation he is in and learn quickly how to survive in that environment. Shaw's genius extended to his mechanical engineering, scientific, and business skills. When Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons are unavailable to complete a task, S.H.I.E.L.D. would look to Shaw to fill their shoes. Shaw also had extensive theories on Time Travel and the Multiverse, and was usually proven right in his hypotheses on how they worked. - Master Engineer: Shaw skills with engineering seemingly put him on par with his grandfather. He displayed high enough technical skills to recreate the Framework in the future for the people of the Lighthouse to use to get away from the horrors of the Kree, only using fragments of the equipment which had been abandoned for decades. Thanks to his frequent use of his Gravity Puck, Shaw also acquired sufficient knowledge about Gravitonium, being able to assist S.H.I.E.L.D. in their quest for the element and advise them about how they ought to transport it. Because of his knowledge of the presents' electronics in the future, Shaw was able to repair the Lighthouse's systems after the Siege of the Lighthouse easily. Since he spent his life reverse-engineering alien technology, Shaw was able to decrypt and repair other alien technology, such as Sarge's tracker and his Shrike Repeller. With the assistance of his grandparents, Shaw was able to create Sonic Barrier Cuffs and successfully duplicate them in a mass production of them for the other agents. Shaw's also capable of hotwiring a car from a completely different time period without any issues. After being stranded in the 1980s, Shaw was able to recover the Chronicom LMD Phil Coulson's hard drive and successfully download it into a television and create a whole new Shotgun-Axe for Alphonso Mackenzie, even upgrading it, with little to work with. Though Shaw had little knowledge of the Time Drive, he was able to understand the basic properties enough to be able to repair it when it malfunctioned. - \"I'm the one with the scientific knowledge to be able to repatch the power.\" - Deke Shaw to Alphonso Mackenzie[src] - Expert Scientist: Shaw displayed a good level of scientific knowledge, especially in the field of physics. Having used Gravitonium for years with his Gravity Puck, he was familiar with how the element worked, for example correctly inferring that the Principia might have been hit by a thunderstorm that could have charged its Gravitonium cargo and lifted it up in the air. He was also able to understand the nature of Izel's powers by listening to Sarge describing how her song \"resonated\" in his body, thus figuring out that Izel's possession was based on resonance frequencies, thus giving an idea to counter her abilities. In his last mission with his teammates, Shaw also quickly understood the functioning of the Quantum Tunnel, gave the idea to use it to remove the Chronicom fleet from the timeline they were and decided to stay behind because he considered himself the only one with the necessary scientific knowledge to activate it. - Master Tactician: Shaw was an incredible strategist to ensure his survival in the harsh world that he lived in. In order to not die, he made a deal with Kasius and turned on the Destroyer of Worlds, selling her to Kasius in exchange for tokens. He never tried to get into trouble or took risks until he met S.H.I.E.L.D.. When he left S.H.I.E.L.D., Shaw easily created a new company despite it ripping off S.H.I.E.L.D. tech. However, he was able to use the tech for his own profit and market it off as his own creation, which only furthered his business so that he could survive in the present. When stuck in the past, Shaw was able to do similar things as he ripped off future songs to create his own band called the Deke Squad. This helped him gain a lot of money. In actuality, it was a front for S.H.I.E.L.D., which he was able to build a team around so that Alphonso Mackenzie could return to his job. When leaving the team so they could jump to the future, Shaw was immediately appointed Director. When first emerging in 1931, Shaw was able to get clothes to disguise the team in a matter of minutes. Thinks the world is all about making money, very good at making money. - Expert Businessman: Despite having no formal training, Shaw was able to successfully start a tech company after leaving S.H.I.E.L.D. in less than a year. The company was quite successful and made Shaw rich. He repeated this success when he was able to develop a famous band called the Deke Squad. Both of these came with merchandise and anoything else to help him during its time. He used social media to spread his ideas for his company, and live shows to spread his band. When agreeing to help S.H.I.E.L.D., he was able to score units from Tess. - Expert Combatant: Living in a time where survival was a necessity, Shaw learned how to handle himself in hand-to-hand combat. He was able to go toe-to-toe with an injured Melinda May and win (with the help of his Gravity Puck). He was, however, no match for the well-trained Sinara. Shaw, however, held his own against a recreation of a Kree warrior and won, despite being caught off guard after just watching a recreation of his mother be killed by the Kree seconds before. Shaw was also able to take down two Remorath warriors with little trouble, and later effectively defended himself from Sarge and his Squad. Still outmatched by enemies such as the Chronicom Hunters, who were advanced robotic aliens, Shaw was able to escape from one's grasp by using his ingenuity, as shown by how he used the Facial Reconstruction Scanner, a device not normally used for combat purposes, and utilized it to strike at the Chronicom's weak spot. After being kidnapped by HYDRA, Mackenzie had Shaw improve his fighting abilities to ensure it didn't happen again. - \"You sure you can handle the gunplay?\"\"Oh, he's been practicing his shooting. You should see his video game.\" - Daisy Johnson and Alphonso Mackenzie[src] - \"You are horrifying to look at. But that's a good thing.\"\"Oh?\"\"When you're ugly and someone loves you, you know they love you for who you are. Beautiful people never know who to trust.\"\"Well, then I am certainly grateful to be ugly!\" - Drax and Mantis[src] Mantis is somewhat na\u00efve, showing no offense when Drax the Destroyer refers to her as Ego's pet and not understanding what a practical joke is or that she embarrassed Peter Quill by revealing his attraction to Gamora. passive demeanor, always bowing her head in Ego's presence and being hesitant to attack anyone. This inevitably resulted in her having low self-confidence. In spite of her loyalty to Ego, she was unable to condone him slaughtering his own children eventually telling the Guardians of Ego's true plan and working with them to thwart him. Even while fighting the cops when she and Drax attempted to bring Kevin Bacon to Knowhere, Mantis didn't want to kill them, but just put them to sleep. Even years later, her na\u00efvet\u00e9 persisted Much like Drax, she was blunt to the point of open honesty almost entirely non-malicious instead approaching of curiosity. Despite her lack of weapons, she was a brave individual openly jumping at Thanos in spite of the Titan possessing four Infinity Stones and later using her powers to subdue him. Though maturing, her child-like mind-state still persisted as, generally having a calm personality, is easily angered by Drax, possibly due to the fact that Drax was her closest friend. Since Drax was the one who encouraged her and supported her when she was still serving Ego, she acts most comfortably around Drax. became more caring towards the other members - \"What you did all these years... it wasn't you. You didn't have a choice.\"\"I know. But I did it.\" Due to his advanced physiology, however, Barnes survived his apparent death but was found by HYDRA instead. Trained as a living weapon, Barnes became a new man so to speak, as his memories and identity were constantly being wiped until he was augmented into the perfect assassin, the Winter Soldier. As the Winter Soldier, he was brutal and ruthless with an utter lack of conscience, and remorselessly followed HYDRA's every order. However, his first encounter with Rogers following his fall and brainwashing, caused him to remember parts of his old life and realize he knew Rogers. In his second encounter with Rogers, he refused to believe he remembered him due to his memory being wiped again, but after Rogers repeated the same line Bucky said to him following the funeral of Rogers' mother, Bucky realized how he knew Rogers, which freed him from Hydra's mind control. No longer under Hydra's control, Barnes saved Rogers after the Insight Helicarrier blew up. While he later told Steve he did not know why he did it, it was due to Rogers reminding him of who he was, to which he initially reacted with violence before finally accepting the truth of it. Even though Barnes has regained his identity and former values, he has also developed a guilt-ridden conscience, and became deeply ashamed and remorseful over his actions as the Winter Soldier. He previously stated that he has an absolute memory of every person he has killed, and acknowledges with great regret and self-loathing that the fact he was brainwashed does not change the fact that he killed them. Upon watching his murder of Howard and Maria Stark, he was visibly stunned and ashamed of what he had done. Fearing for his mental state changing and what he might bring about those around him, Barnes ultimately decided that placing himself in cryogenic stasis until he could be cured of HYDRA's mental programming completely would be the best course of action. After being cured of HYDRA's programming, Barnes appears to have come to terms with his past. As the White Wolf, Barnes lived quietly in Wakanda, where he spent his time entertaining the children and farming, until T'Challa asked for his assistance in the Battle of Wakanda. When presented with a replacement cybernetic arm, Barnes, recognizing its meaning, didn't hesitate to join his allies in the battle. However, severe self-loathing persists due to the extent and nature of the crimes HYDRA forced him to commit, to the extent that he recognized that John Walker was dangerously unstable and unfit for the mantle of Captain America, long before the Super Soldier Serum and Lemar Hoskins' death caused Walker to become unhinged, purely because he saw aspects of himself in Walker. Despite the years of brainwashing, Barnes still contains many elements of his old self, being rather old-fashioned on his first date with Leah, presenting her with a bouquet of flowers, as well as later confessing to Sam Wilson that he still listens to the 40s era music. Barnes holds a deep personal connection to Captain America's Shield, stating that it's the closest thing that he has left to a family. He is deeply hurt after finding out that Wilson has given the shield to the Smithsonian Institution, and that Walker has subsequently taken the mantle of Captain America. The legacy of the shield is what ultimately causes Barnes and Wilson to cross paths once again. Barnes initially confronts Wilson on several occasions, directly criticizing him for surrendering the shield, believing that he has disrespected and discarded Captain America's legacy like it was nothing. Barnes later confesses that the reason why he has initially pressured and blamed Wilson for giving up the shield was because it made him question Rogers' decisions, as well as his own. Regardless of their many differences, Barnes has developed a close bond with Wilson during their struggle against the Flag Smashers, with Barnes later voluntarily helping him fix the Paul & Darlene family boat, and with Wilson subsequently inviting Barnes to sleep over at the Wilson Family Residence. After helping him practice throwing the shield, Barnes sincerely apologizes to Wilson, stating that he now realizes the pressure that Wilson was under after Rogers initially gave him the shield. Barnes also confesses about his nightmares, showing his newly developed trust in Wilson. Programmed to kill, extremely skilled assassin, brainwashed, lived in complete anonymity, the intelligence community does not believe she exists. - Master Martial Artist: Winter Soldier is an extremely skilled and formidable hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist, excelling at improvisation and weapons handling, making him one of the most powerful and best fighters on the planet. He employs mixed martial arts that include elements of systema, karate, boxing, muay Thai, Krav Maga, and kali. Originally, Barnes was a three-time YMCA welterweight boxing champion. Later, as the first Winter Soldier, Barnes received vast training from HYDRA, as well as the United States Armed Forces. Combined with his enhanced physical abilities, Barnes became an extremely dangerous master assassin who can slaughter dozens of enemies alone, take on and even overpower highly skilled martial artists such as Black Widow and Falcon with relative ease, be in charge of training the other Winter Soldiers, and easily beating and locking them away when they went berserk, and go toe-to-toe with the likes of Captain America and Black Panther. In the Battle of Washington, D.C., the two engaged in a brutal one-on-one fight, both matching each other with every move, though Rogers was ultimately able to defeat him in their second duel, he later beat Rogers after being released by Helmut Zemo, catching him off guard. While under Winter Soldier programming Barnes effortlessly beat Falcon, an expert trained combatant, by grabbing his face and throwing him to the prison cell, knocking him out during the second encounter. Barnes also single-handedly killed up to a dozen well-armed Quinjet pilots in a single encounter and escaped uninjured. Barnes easily overpowered a suitless Tony Stark, Sharon Carter, and Black Widow, all in rapid succession and fought evenly with Black Panther. Barnes also held his own repeatedly against T'Challa, even when he wears his Panther Habit, Barnes was able to competitively push him back and restrain him. Although Barnes was briefly outmatched by Iron Man in Mark XLVII Armor, he was able to hold off Iron Man's attempts to kill him, almost defeated him alongside Rogers, and later on he managed to beat him to submission. He has display noticeably superior fighting prowess over super soldiers Flag Smashers and even the U.S. veteran John Walker who was chosen to be the next Captain America. Barnes was able to easily overpower the also super soldiers Flag Smashers with his combat training, quickly delivering blows that pummeled them into submission. In Chase of the Flag Smashers, he managed to resist them while caught off guard over their physical prowess at first but later able to defeat two before being knocked down the truck. With knowledge of their physical prowess which gained from the previous battle, Barnes easily defeated two Flag Smashers in the Ambush at Latvian GRC Resettlement Camp, even handling a knife using Flag Smasher without using the knife he was given until the end. He also easily fended off Ayo's spear assaults while trying not to harm her and she was only able to end the fight due to using her knowledge of how to disarm his Vibranium arm, which he had absolutely no knowledge of. When he fought the highly decorated U.S. Army veteran John Walker who was chosen to be the next Captain America and after he too had taken the Super Soldier Serum, his fighting prowess combined with his own superhuman abilities allowed him to directly contend with him even as Walker was using his shield whereas Falcon was outmatched even with his technology, disarming him of his pistol, briefly taking the initiative and countering his attacks with the shield and ultimately landing several blows on Walker and holding his attempts to hit him in the chest with the shield at bay before Falcon disarmed him, proceeding to easily overpower and man-handle Walker for Falcon to deal the finishing blow to once he was disarmed of his shield. During the Flag Smashers final assault on the GRC, he completely dominated a Flag Smasher to where Morgenthau saw the need to cause a distraction, with Barnes still kicking him down even after being hit, and managed to easily overpower Karli Morgenthau to where he simply dodged her attacks and punched her and Dovich down without much effort even when they were armed, whereas Walker had visibly greater trouble fighting Morgenthau and the Flag Smashers in the battle. Barnes has also proven to be a great mentor, as he trained Wilson in shield throwing and hand-to-hand combat to prepare him to finally become the next Captain America, improving his combat skill to a point where he was able to defeat Georges Batroc even though he lost to him before. - Knife Mastery: Winter Soldier is extremely skilled at using a knife in combat, with an emphasis in Kali knife fighting. The Winter Soldier usually resorts to his combat knife in close quarters combat, as seen during his duel with Rogers on the streets of Washington, D.C. He usually holds the knife in his natural hand and uses his bionic arm for support should he need more force to overpower an opponent, using a downward stab or tossing it between hands to advance his assault, making use of swift and skillful jabs, stabs, and slashes at the enemy's vital points. During his hotel assassination mission as the Winter Soldier, he easily killed enemies with a single knife move and has also shown to be highly skilled at knife throwing, easily hitting his targets with excellent accuracy. Barnes was able to use a knife effectively against Rogers, nearly scoring hits on him during their first fight and impaling him in their second fight. Barnes also used a bayonet knife with a great effect against the Outriders, he was able to kill an Outrider without many difficulties, quickly delivering several lethal stabs and slashes to its neck and vital points. He also easily managed to overwhelm and get a knifepoint on a knife-wielding Flag Smasher upon having pummeled them. - Master Marksman: Barnes is an extremely skilled marksman, being able to handle firearms with remarkable precision, even prior to being turned into the Winter Soldier. During World War II, he shot a HYDRA operative that even Captain America did not see until he was down. His marksmanship was deemed invaluable to the Howling Commandos destruction of HYDRA's bases and the thwarting of the Nazi troops. As the Winter Soldier, he became an even deadlier master marksman. He accurately fired a single round through Black Widow's stomach and into a nuclear scientist that she was protecting, killing him. Winter Soldier is also capable of making long-range shots without the use of a rifle, for example, shooting Nick Fury multiple times through the wall of Steve Rogers' apartment and from the top of another building. Barnes has also proven to be highly skilled with pistols as well, being able to accurately fire at Rogers while fighting him in close combat, even managing to land a single shot on Rogers and thus push him into defensive, and later even manage to land two shots on Rogers with one bullet went through his stomach when he was stopping Project Insight from initiate. As the Winter Soldier, Barnes has caught and handled Captain America's Shield on two occasions and showed impressive ability in doing so. He was also able to use his gun to swiftly take out many Outriders during the Battle of Wakanda. He even attempted to shoot Thanos to prevent him from extracting the Mind Stone out of Vision, only to be subdued by Thanos, who blasted him into the bushes with the Power Stone. Barnes later on easily shot multiple mercenaries hired by the Power Broker with a pistol. Thinks humans are the weakest element in any system, more so than software or hardware. - Expert Tactician: Barnes has received training in military tactics and leadership, and has spent decades as a soldier and covert operative, using quick thinking and resourcefulness to execute his assignments, which has proven to be an accomplished strategist and leader, earning the title of Sergeant. He was able to command an entire unit during the World War I and serve as Rogers second in command among the Howling Commandos. As the Winter Soldier, his strategical aptitude was only enhanced even further with training to be HYDRA's most covert operative, having been able to successfully come up with flawless plans that allowed him to both execute his victims while leaving no traces behind. After escaping HYDRA's control he managed to stay off the grid for two years despite the active search of Sam Wilson and Steve Rogers, with an already formulated escape plan with a burn bag ready should he be found. Barnes quickly formulated a plan with Zemo to assist the criminal in his escape from the Berlin Correctional Facility and noted that the most vulnerable portion of any security system was the staff members. Expert martial artist, pilot, fluent in English and Russian. - Expert Marksman: Shaw was able to successfully use a handgun and kill two Kree Watch members with it when rebelling against the Kree with his S.H.I.E.L.D. allies despite no previous experience in handling a firearm. Shaw's skills with a gun improved over time thanks to his time in Remorath Rumble and he was shown shooting several Shrike hosts with ease during the Battle at the Temple of the Forgotten. He shot and killed Wilfred Malick with a single shot to the chest. - an extremely skilled and formidable hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist. - highly skilled and well-trained in the use of firearms. She is proficient with sniper rifles. She later easily used a rifle's grenade launcher. Highly skilled in incorporating gymnastics and acrobatics into her fighting style. - highly skilled spy, being able to go undercover perfectly for years without arousing suspicion. Thinks people are defined by what they do, instead of nice words, highly skilled assassin. a cynical person with a very sarcastic, deadpan sense of humor, with a bit of a bent moral compass as she notably had no problem holding a civilian at gunpoint and stealing his car to evade from pursuers. strong sense of right and wrong. Having felt abandoned by her family, Belova notably has a strained relationship with her adoptive parents and older sister, telling them outright how betrayed they made her feel when none of them came back for her. Despite this, Belova still cared and loved them, admitting to Melina Vostokoff that to her she will always be her mother, and telling Alexei Shostakov that he meant everything to her as a child. As she found out that Romanoff sacrificed herself for the sake of the humanity, Belova was blinded by grief and was quick to believe Valentina Allegra de Fontaine that Clint Barton was directly responsible for the death of her sister. Belova made it her goal to get revenge by killing Barton and called him a bloodthirsty murderer, while talking to Kate Bishop about his activities as the Ronin. Although Belova kept her laid-back and upbeat attitude, she was relentless in her resolve to kill Barton, despite helping out Bishop finding out about her mother's connection to Kingpin. In the final confrontation with Barton, Belova accused him of not stopping Romanoff from giving her life away and blamed herself for not being around to stop her. She was incredibly jealous of Barton who spent so much time with her, but Barton reminded her of what kind of person Romanoff was, which stopped Belova from killing him, as they shared their loss together. No one can match her efficiency or ruthlessness, the greatest assassin ever. A military man, Mazer was dutiful to his fellow soldiers and superiors, even when they abused their power. As the Formic Wars progress Mazer slowly loses more and more of his morality, however. In 97 BX, he is apprehensive about the training of children at the Variable Gravity Acclimatization School, but by 0 BX he has no qualms about manipulating and lying to Ender Wiggin about the Formics and the \"simulation\" he was supposedly playing. His time spent completely alone on his relativistic journey likely led to the further deterioration of his morality as well. - Master Martial Artist: Belova is an extremely skilled and formidable hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist, having been gone through the training of the Red Room since young age in order to become a Widow, making her one of the most dangerous and best fighters on the planet. She was able to fight Natasha Romanoff evenly, matching her move for move before they had a truce. During the fight she employed a wide variety of throws and locks. Compared to Romanoff's more acrobatic style of fighting, Belova has a more direct and hands-on way of fighting that seems heavily influenced by Sambo, including combat styles such as Belova is able to quickly use her surroundings to her advantage and use random items as improvised weaponry. She was also able to easily fight off several surgeons at once while escaping the Red Room, and was able to quickly incapacitate a guard by disorientating him and sweeping his legs out from under him. Yelena was able to easily outclass Kate Bishop, while simultaneously being able to keep up with, and sometimes even gain the upper hand against, the extremely skilled and experienced martial artists Clint Barton and Maya Lopez, though Barton was more focused on protecting Bishop than engaging Yelena. Belova is also very physically strong and resilient, as she could flip her sister into a wall with one leg and lift Kate Bishop over her head and throw her off a building. Belova also has very good reflexes, being able to catch a bottle of hot sauce that Bishop threw at her head. Highly skilled at using a knife in combat, able to quickly throw a two-inch blade with great accuracy. - \"I'm realizing it's impossible to ever know who you really are. I mean, to me, you're a turncoat assassin, but then you go and save the world when the world wants to lock you up. It's simply impossible to know whose side you're on.\" - Thaddeus Ross to Natasha Romanoff[src] The entirety of Romanoff's character was hard to distinguish based on how she tricked and lied to people for a living. She was capable of convincingly portraying friendly and flirtatious, timid, vulnerable, and scared. For the most part, she was a level-headed, strong-willed, and independent woman. Romanoff normally maintained a controlled, almost emotionless persona to keep whatever she was thinking a secret unless she was around people she absolutely trusts. Although she was more than willing to rush into deadly battle and other unnerving missions for S.H.I.E.L.D., she was not completely fearless, as she was visibly frightened of Hulk. However, she was no longer afraid of him due to falling in love with Bruce Banner. Though a very serious agent, Romanoff was by no means stuffy and has a sarcastic sense of humor, which mostly surfaces when she was with Captain America or Hawkeye, both of whom she was comfortable around. Romanoff was very smart and loyal which was displayed when she made good on the debts she owed Barton and Rogers (saving the former from Loki's mind control and trying to protect the latter during a highway assault). While tough and at times ruthless, she was still a good person and can be quite heroic in her own right. These qualities are usually brought out by her other Avengers, mainly her missions with Steve Rogers. And no matter how injured she was in battle, Romanoff will go out her way to make sure bystanders are out of harm's way (keeping several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents away when Banner was transforming into Hulk, helping Hawkeye evacuate civilians when the Chitauri attacked Manhattan, and risking her life to make sure innocent people weren't shot by the Winter Soldier when he was chasing her). Her close loyalty to both Rogers and Barton was shown in the Avengers Civil War, as she was willing to aid their faction despite being forced to go on the run from the United Nations afterward. As a result of her childhood, she considered the Avengers her family, being desperate to keep them together when the Sokovia Accords were due to be signed and was affected when Tony Stark denounced her as a friend and made it clear he would not help her in the future. She was further shocked and saddened when Barton following the loss of his family became more ruthless and violent when she encountered him in Tokyo. Romanoff was also very close with Clint Barton's family, especially with his and Laura Barton's only daughter, Lila, being the only member of Avengers who knew of their existence. Romanoff was genuinely affectionate with the child, hugging her the moment they reunited and sweetly commended the little girl on the drawing she made. They originally named their youngest child after Romanoff before them discovering that it was, in fact, a boy, thus naming him Nathaniel instead, with Romanoff humorously referring to the unborn child as a \"traitor.\" This was further proven in Vormir where she refused to let Clint sacrifice himself, knowing how much he meant to his family and vice-versa, and sacrificed herself instead because she believed she had less to lose. Despite her lifestyle of espionage and operating within the shadows, Romanoff's adaptability influenced her opinions on the Sokovia Accords. Realizing the difference between S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers with many of their activities seen in the light of day amongst the public, Romanoff wanted to appease public opinions by signing and also that she didn't want conflict with her close friends and teammates like Barton and Rogers. This care for Captain America eventually caused Romanoff to betray Stark's team and assist their escape so they could clear Barnes' name, eventually becoming a fugitive because of this. - \"Natasha, not just a spy, not just toppling regimes, destroying empires from within, but an Avenger.\" - Alexei Shostakov to Natasha Romanoff[src] Natasha Romanoff was one of the most talented spies and lethal assassins in the world. She was said by her instructor Madame B. to be the best student in the Red Room, never failing a single test. Both the KGB and S.H.I.E.L.D. considered her as one of their most dangerous operatives. Romanoff was highly skilled in martial arts, armed combat, espionage, infiltration, disguise, manipulation, evasion, hacking, and assassination. Romanoff's extraordinary skill-set made her a core member of the Avengers. Romanoff also displayed impressive endurance and durability, being able to withstand being shot in the shoulder by Winter Soldier, being hit and flung away by Hulk, being launched into a car by a powerful kick from Taskmaster, falling from a building and hitting several metal structures on the way down, and taking many blows from several Widows, all of which failed to render her so much as unconscious. - \"Why am I back? How'd you get him out?\"\"Cognitive recalibration. I hit you really hard on the head.\" - Clint Barton and Natasha Romanoff[src] - Master Martial Artist: Romanoff was an extremely skilled and formidable hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist, having trained from a young age in the Red Room and S.H.I.E.L.D. in her later life as a top operative, making her one of the most dangerous fighters on the planet. During her time in the Red Room, she was seen using her martial arts to defeat a grown man by swinging his head into the corner of a desk, proving how formidable she was even when she was young. She was extremely skilled in the field of martial arts, having mastered arts such as sambo, hapkido, Lucha libre-style wrestling, Krav Maga, multiple styles of kung fu, wing chun, Taekwondo, and kali with her batons. Romanoff has efficiently taken down many enemies, such as a squadron of armed soldiers after being ambushed in a hotel room, multiple Hammer Industries security guards, Georges Batroc's armed pirates, several members of STRIKE, Chitauri aliens, Ultron Sentries, and Outriders. She was skilled enough to be able to defeat a mind-controlled Hawkeye, maintain the upper hand against Ant-Man, and even hold her own against the much stronger Winter Soldier, though he was able to bring her down in the end. Black Widow also managed to compete with Proxima Midnight alongside Okoye, even managing to disarm her with her baton, holding her off long enough for Wanda to kill her. In addition, she had enough skill to stab Corvus Glaive using Proxima Midnight's Spear. Romanoff was able to hold her own against many Widows at once, fight the similarly trained Yelena Belova to a standstill, and managed to engage Taskmaster in combat for a prolonged period of time, though Taskmaster had the upper hand throughout the fight. - Master Marksman: Romanoff was an extremely skilled marksman specialised in sharpshooting. During the Battle of Washington, D.C., Romanoff would have shot the Winter Soldier through his eye if he had not been wearing his protective goggles. She had also been trained from a young age in the art of sharpshooting, as she was seen practicing on targets, making several headshots in quick succession. - Master Acrobat: Romanoff was an extremely skilled gymnast, acrobat, and aerialist, often incorporating gymnastics and acrobatics into her fighting style as she fought opponents. She had numerous complex maneuvers and feats throughout her battles. During her fight within Hammer Industries Headquarters, Romanoff used these skills to defeat the guards with ease. During the Chitauri Invasion, she got to ride a Chitauri Chariot by using her acrobatics to commandeer it. - Master Spy: Romanoff was a dangerous secret agent highly skilled in espionage, stealth, disguise, infiltration, and demolitions. Her talents and years of experience have enabled her to reach a high ranking as a special agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Romanoff is well versed in internal destabilization and was soon deemed a threat to global security because of this. In addition, She was an expert in the field of seduction, often resorted to seducing men to obtain her goals while working undercover, such as when she posed as an assistant to evaluate Tony Stark for the Avengers Initiative. Romanoff was also able to bend many men to her will and sometimes even get them to do her bidding for her, and would continue deceiving them through different means necessary if she still had a further use for them. Moreover, she displayed an uncanny affinity for psychological manipulation and could mask her real emotions perfectly. Romanoff's skills were so legendary that Nick Fury created a lie detector that he hoped she wouldn't be able to deceive. Her incredible talents for deception also enabled her to detect when others were lying, such as when she was able to discern that Captain America was lying to her about not knowing why Nick Fury was at his apartment. Councilwoman Pamela Hawley even stated that she was unaware Romanoff was Russian due to her complete lack of an accent, stating she sounded perfectly American. - Master Assassin: Romanoff was notorious in the art of assassination, considered to be one of the most dangerous assassins in the world. She was known to have killed many people during her time serving the KGB and S.H.I.E.L.D. During her time in the Red Room, Romanoff was trained to kill without remorse and was seen demonstrating her sharpshooting skills on a live captive, showing no emotion as she killed him. - \"I bet you knew Fury hired the pirates, didn't you?\"\"Well, it makes sense. The ship was dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.\" - Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff[src] - Gifted Intellect: Romanoff's intellect seemingly put her on par with Steve Rogers and Clint Barton. She possessed the ability to quickly process multiple information streams like threat assessments and rapidly respond to changing tactical situations. Romanoff also possessed a vast knowledge of human anatomy, displayed by her often using joint locks and hitting enemies in the weakest parts of their bodies; for example the crotch, stomach, armpits, and the head. Her prodigious skill from her years of training also allows her to predict her opponents' plans of attack as well, such as when she was able to save herself, Captain America, and Falcon from being shot by the Winter Soldier by predicting the order in which he would shoot at them through the roof of their car. Victoria Hand has even stated that Romanoff does not usually require extraction teams on S.H.I.E.L.D. missions and is resourceful enough to make her own escape. - \"You yourself have designed dozens of operations like this. You know how this works.\"\"Usually with an extraction plan.\"\"Barton, Romanoff; they never have an extraction plan.\" - Victoria Hand and Phil Coulson[src] - Expert Tactician: Romanoff was a very effective strategist, tactician, and field commander, being able to lead the Avengers and even S.H.I.E.L.D. on one occasion. Romanoff was able to trick Ross and his entire S.W.A.T. team thinking that they had tracked her down to a train station in Albany using the tracker on her suit, but she already knew and deliberately left them there in order to lure them to the wrong place and thus buying herself more time to go to her hiding place. Moreover, Romanoff, in conjunction with Yelena Belova constructed a plan to successfully break Red Guardian out of prison. She later collaborated with Melina Vostokoff to construct a plan to bring down the Red Room and kill General Dreykov in a short amount of time before Red Room soldiers arrived. - \"I'm in the middle of an interrogation. This moron is giving me everything.\" - Natasha Romanoff to Phil Coulson[src] - Master Interrogator: Romanoff was able to trick Loki into telling her about his plan to use Hulk against the Helicarrier to bust him out of his cell. She was able to do a \"reverse interrogation\"; while she seemed to be in danger, in truth, she was getting all the information she wanted to know. Romanoff utilized this technique once again to goad Dreykov into revealing the key needed to access his console. - \"What are you doing?\"\"I'm rebooting Rhodey's suit.\" Natasha Romanoff[src] - Expert Hacker: Romanoff could hack into most computer systems without tripping any firewalls or security. She used this talent to hack into Hammer Industries mainframe and help James Rhodes regain control of the War Machine Armor and enabled him to help Stark fight the rest of the attacking Hammer drones, and again to access the location of Camp Lehigh from the USB Steve Rogers received from Nick Fury. - Pilot: Romanoff was a skilled pilot, capable of piloting a Quinjet by herself with ease, and was able to copilot a helicopter along with Yelena Belova. - \"That's love. That pain is love. I know, because... I was afraid of it, too. But you let me feel it. You gave that gift to me. You pulled me out of that cubical. You gave me purpose. A crew.\" - Melinda May to Sarge[src] May is fiercely protective of her teammates, going back into the field to protect Coulson despite having retired from field missions, taking up the Berserker Staff instead of Grant Ward, and going so far as attacking Ian Quinn after he shot Skye. She is very secretive and will often answer questions with a look, using few words or none at all. Despite her protectiveness of them, it took May a long time to bond with her team. Skye even claimed that she acted like a robot, as everything for her was just \"Target- acquired. Threat- eliminated.\" Melinda May puts up a cold and stoic front but inside she is kind and selfless. She uses her own experiences to connect with other people. Despite being able to use various types of guns with high proficiency, May displays constant reluctance to resort to such weaponry, instead relying on her tremendous fighting abilities to take down her enemies. The fact that she only uses firearms when it is absolutely necessary, like during the Siege of the Lighthouse, has become somewhat of a running gag among her teammates. Therefore, when May was seen repeatedly shooting Sarge in an apparent attempt to kill him, her teammates knew that something was wrong since May would really have gone hand-to-hand with him, and they eventually figured out that she had been possessed by Izel. Ninja assassin. - Master Martial Artist: May is an extremely skilled and formidable hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist. She is the most lethal agent S.H.I.E.L.D. has ever seen, having been training since she was 12 and possessing more black belts than the notorious Black Widow. For one, she practices tai chi. May was able to take down a Centipede assassin and beat Grant Ward in a sparring match and twice again, once when he was under the influence of Lorelei and the other time when they fought at Cybertek. Agent 33 underestimated May in their fight because both were trained by S.H.I.E.L.D. Even after being tortured she was able to defeat Agent 33. May has also subdued opponents far stronger than humans such as Kree, LMDs, Primitives, and Remorath in close quarters. Her sense of fighting is so instinctive that she was able to circumvent Ben's mind-reading ability. Even while not at her peak condition, she has displayed the ability to defeat a squad of HYDRA soldiers in hand to hand combat. May was able to defeat the three of Sarge's crew, Pax, Jaco, and Snowflake on her own, with the two latter one-on-two. She has been overcome in physical combat on very few occasions, especially by opponents with superhuman strength, such as Michael Peterson when he took her by surprise in an alley in Los Angeles, or the Asgardian Lorelei, and Eva Belyakov; although in the end, May managed to reverse the situation and eliminate Belyakov. - Expert Marksman: May prefers not to use firearms during her missions unless strictly necessary, generally preferring her melee combat and improvisational skills. If forced to use them, May usually chooses handguns as her weapon, even when the agents that accompany her equip assault weapons. She has displayed high accuracy, being able to kill most of her enemies with a single shot, or being able to shoot Lance Hunter in the shoulder to avoid compromising Jemma Simmons' mission cover within HYDRA. She can also dual-wield pistols with ease. May is also skilled in throwing knives, as she used one to kill Luca Russo. - Master Acrobat: May is exceptionally athletic, and can be seen using her acrobatic skills to her advantage. She was able to surpass the speed of a running Cybertek security guard by doing multiple handsprings to take him out. Her reflexes, quickness, and coordination are remarkable enough to evade Absorbing Man's ball and chain, the rope dart knife of elite assassin Marcus Scarlotti, perform an aerial off a car, dodge Sinara's orbs with a heavily wounded leg, and flip through active gunfire while returning accurate shots of her own. - Master Spy: May is regarded as one of the best spies in S.H.I.E.L.D.. She was Phil Coulson's right hand during his directorial days. She also taught Skye everything she needed to know about being a spy. During the Rescue in Bahrain, May was able to get into the building swiftly and sneak around to take soldiers quietly and stealthy. She has been able to disguise herself as well. She posed as Shu Wong as well as speaking mandarin in order to infiltrate the ATCU. Research was usually Foster's top priority, as she couldn't resist checking out an anomaly even though she was on a date, and later got mad when Darcy Lewis called the police, disrupting their uninterrupted access to the anomaly. Foster put a lot of faith into her research, even when others doubted her, but she never let it dissuade her, especially as she ended up being correct many times. That was why she trusted Thor and believed his story even though Erik Selvig, her mentor, warned her against him. Even when diagnosed with cancer, Foster still was fully focused on working in her lab to find a cure her own way. Because of her investment into scientific research, Foster found herself most confident in situations that cater for it, and found working helpful to calm her. However, outside of her area of expertise, Foster was awkward in social settings, as she didn't interact with many people outside of the scientific community, also stating that she never had guests. When she went on a date with Richard Madison, Foster didn't know what to do, so she hid behind her menu not saying anything. Not immature, possessed a strong childlike wonder in regards to scientific discoveries. While Foster was passionate for her research, the only other thing that could possibly equal it was her love for Thor. At first, Foster was just intrigued by him, as he could help with her research, although she did find Thor attractive. But when Foster bonded with Thor, and he taught her about the Nine Realms, she developed strong feelings for him, and would later reveal that she loved the way he explained things. Passionate for her research, incredibly strong love. When Thor left Earth and didn't return, Foster was unable to get over him, and immediately fell back in love when he returned, despite the heartbreak he put her through. When they resparked their love, it was proven to be incredibly strong, as Foster was willing to die with Thor during the Battle of Greenwich when she wasn't able to save him from the crashing Ark. And when Thor left again, Foster still remained hopeful he would return, despite what happened last time. This love had always been in Foster's nature, which was what made her a terrific person, and was the main reason Thor understood humanity, allowing him to become worthy again. When Frigga died protecting her from Malekith, Foster felt responsible and didn't want any more harm to occur because of her. Additionally, when Loki \"died\", Foster was visibly saddened by this, even though she didn't like him, but because he had helped save her life. And it was the love that Foster had with Thor that stopped Gorr the God Butcher from killing all gods. Always willing to help whenever she could, proven herself valuable in battle with her intellect, often surrounded by mighty allies. Does not hesitate to help out in a fight, excelling at it impressively, does not shy away from going up against terrifying and powerful people, decides to join a fight and save the world at the cost of her own life and happiness. Has a certain respect for the things she would get to do if she did not have a huge responsibility. - Master Scientist: Foster has become one of the most important astrophysicists in the world, having studied the existence of Einstein-Rosen Bridges, also known as wormholes, since before discovering their true nature through her experiences with Thor. Once he departed from New Mexico, Foster developed a revolutionary theory on wormholes known as the Foster Theory. She began to give lectures around the world, and she was even considered a serious candidate for the Nobel Prize. When called about a weird phenomenon, Foster discovered a portal-like anomaly. She was also able to use a Gravimetric Spike to accurately determine when a portal will open and control the portal. Initially, Mobius thought the workers in the TVA are all creations from the Time-Keepers to maintain stability of the timeline and viewed it as his sole purpose to exist, and believes that the ends justify the means, and that their job is never finished until the Time-Keepers finished \"tidying\" the timeline. He was also willing to put trust on the newcomer Loki variant in helping the TVA arrest Sylvie. When Mobius had discovered that Loki betrayed him, he was initially quite enraged and upset at his behavior telling him that the TVA pruned Sylvie just to manipulate him to get revenge from him for betraying him. However, when he discovered that what Loki was saying about him being a variant along with the rest of the TVA was indeed true, he went on to go out of his way to support the two, until he got pruned. Whilst Mobius was stuck in the Void traveling around constantly to escape from Alioth, he eventually allowed himself to free himself from the shackles of the TVA so that he could think about living his own life, and is even willing to burn the TVA to the ground for free will. - \"He's lying. Just playing games. There's no one out there. You had me for a second. My ears are sharp too.\" - Mobius M. Mobius to Loki[src] - Genius-Level Intellect: Mobius is considered, even by Loki, to be incredibly intelligent and knowledgeable about time and the many ways it can impact the past, present, and future. He believed himself to be Ravonna Renslayer's favorite analyst due to his intelligence and personable nature. He was able to predict Loki's plan when Loki kept asking to see and speak to the Time-Keepers as a way to overthrow and take over the Time Variance Authority. Albeit, this is because Loki is very predictable for someone considered to be unpredictable. He is also able to tell when Loki is trying to trick and lie to him, a very rare intellectual feat that very few people are capable of achieving in the Multiverse. - Master Pilot: May is a highly proficient pilot, able to perform such feats as flying through the eye of a storm with a plane as large as the Bus, or deceiving a series of HYDRA Quinjets into believing the plane had been destroyed using a clever cloaking maneuver. She, as mission commander, is usually in charge of piloting the Quinjet as well. After being ambushed and sent into the future May was able to use her knowledge and skill to effectively fly and dock the Trawler through the debris field of what was once Earth despite having never flown a spaceship. Since then she has received training from Tess and is now a competent spacecraft pilot even able to efficiently return to the Lighthouse from the Earth fragment 616 on a cut off and depleting fuel supply. - Master Assassin: As a Black Widow, Belova is a extremely skilled assassin, being able to kill her targets with incredible efficiency. She has killed many people while she was under the control of the Red Room, including Oksana. Belova also attempted to assassinate Clint Barton, as she was instructed to by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine. - Master Scientist: Vostokoff was able to make a chemical that could control pigs' minds, which was employed by Dreykov as a way to ensure the loyalty of his Widows. She demonstrated knowledge in entomology and chemistry when she identified a species of fireflies and explained the concept of bioluminescence to a young Yelena. Able to fly a plane and jet. - Master Tactician: Due to his military training and years of experience, Russo became a brilliant military tactician, orchestrating multiple ambushes and counter-attacks, including the Robbery of the ReadyQuick Check Cashing, the Raid of the Lower East Side Housing Project and the Ambush at the Valhalla. He was also able to successfully create and lead his own crew with great effort. Russo's military experience allowing him to sense traps and ambushes that anyone planned on him, which Russo was even smart enough that he knows all about Anvil Headquarters's layout which allowed him to kill Homeland Security agents silently without getting caught and successfully prevent the ambush. Russo can sense the trap that Curtis Hoyle set on him for the Punisher's attempted assassination and prevent it with ease. - Master Tactician: Castle is a highly skilled, effective and experienced military tactician, since notably, during the seemingly hopeless extraction of his unit, Castle assumed command, and single-handedly cleared a helicopter landing zone of enemy combatants (that prevented his unit's escape), while the rest of his men, even Ray Schoonover, hunkered down. Castle even anticipated this conflict as a trap, despite Schoonover requesting his tactical input and Russo supporting his strategic instincts only to have Rawlins negate it. He later received the Navy Cross for his efforts. As the Punisher, Castle later used these tactics to single-handedly track and kill entire gangs of criminals with high efficiency, to the point that Castle was initially mistaken by Daredevil and the police for an entire squad of gunmen, rather than a single man. - Master Interrogator: Castle enrolled in his SERE course, and is thus well-versed in interrogation tactics, such as employing intimidation techniques to extract information from suspects. Castle was able to successfully perform a reverse interrogation on Carson Wolf which allowed him to learn the truth about his family's murder. Castle was also able to extract information from Jake Nelson, a fellow war veteran who took the SERE course, through torture. - Master Investigator: Page discovered a passion for detective work while cooperating with Ben Urich and Mitchell Ellison. When she began working for the New York Bulletin, she proved herself to be a highly capable investigative reporter. She received praise from Foggy Nelson for her skills, and Matt Murdock stated she was much more stable than Jessica Jones, a reputable private investigator in her own right. She is apt at keeping secrets and working undercover, dying her hair to maintain her cover. She developed relationships, some romantic, for the purpose of gathering intelligence. She was also able to hide her true allegiance. Passion for detective work, - Expert Scientist: Morse has a degree in biology. She was asked to assess the Truncheon and documented its capabilities; however, her skills as a scientist were not good enough for her to learn anything of value when she was a spy in HYDRA Laboratories. During the absence of Jemma Simmons and while Leo Fitz searched for her, Morse took charge of the laboratory, and analyzed technology from the Advanced Threat Containment Unit and biological samples from newly discovered Inhumans. - \"Didn't want to crack him yourself?\"\"Bobbi is as good as they come.\" - possessed a strong willpower, which is fueled by a deep reserve of inner strength, as well as a cynical, sarcastic sense of humor. She was very kind and caring, but also very stubborn and independent, also suffered from varying degrees of emotional instability and deep psychological turmoil.

She was able to figure out Sunil Bakshi's entire past and personality, despite him only saying eight words to her. When Bakshi did talk to her, Morse was able to analyze what he said and find the information that was necessary. Morse finds it easier to read a person when he/she is speaking English. Morse was able to read Elliot Randolph and determine that he was doing a threat assessment of her and her teammates and that Randolph was only with them to verify the authenticity of the Monolith. - \"You know, friends don't put other people's lives at risk for selfish reasons.\"\"Selfish? I'd take a bullet for any one of you. Not for the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo on the wall - for you.\" - Melinda May and Lance Hunter[src] Became truly loyal over time.

Common mercenary, only cares about being paid, sarcastic sense of humor, cares for her comrades, extremely vengeful, retaliates, sense of honor, pilot. - Expert Martial Artist: Hunter is an expert martial artist and has taken down many trained HYDRA mercenaries at the same time, and he also handled himself against the super-powered Carl Creel. He was also able to hold his own in a fist fight against the much larger Spud and eventually defeated him, although he used brass knuckles to do so. Hunter held back initially to maintain his disguise as an unskilled common criminal whilst infiltrating HYDRA. He also easily took down many trained agents of the Real S.H.I.E.L.D. during his escape. - Master Marksman: Hunter is very proficient with many different weapons and is extremely accurate with all of them. He favors the use of rifles and sub-machine guns when acting as member of a tactical team, and usually carries a handgun as his sidearm. Hunter killed Octavian Bloom with a single shot to the forehead. He also shot and killed Toshiro Mori and Anton Petrov. Hunter accurately sniped the Absorbing Man in the head, with the latter surviving only due to his superpowers. He even managed to shoot Grant Ward as he escaped from his HYDRA Warehouse. - Expert Spy: Hunter maintained a convincing cover and quickly created a romantic relationship with Bridget, in order to pickpocket a ticket for fundraiser event from her. Hunter was able to trick Sunil Bakshi into exposing the leadership of HYDRA. He was able to spot the flash-drive that Bobbi Morse, a professional spy had been hiding from him, and was able to tell her excuse, that she and Alphonso Mackenzie were in a support group for people scarred by the HYDRA infiltration of S.H.I.E.L.D. was a lie. He was also able to adapt multiple accents for differing situations. Hunter is able to change his accent, which allows him to blend in easily. - Expert Spy: Under the thrall of Kilgrave and in his quest to buy drugs, Ducasse had proved to be a good spy, being able to take pictures of Jessica Jones, a master detective and highly observant person, without her noticing. Even when using police surveillance videos, Jones was not able to detect him until she was given other clues. He used the fact that most people ignored or excused him to his advantage. She told Trish Walker that Ducasse could make that a career under different circumstances. - Investigator: Under the reluctant tutelage of his boss Jessica Jones, Ducasse became an extremely talented investigator, impressing fellow investigator Pryce Cheng. He managed to seek out information for Jeri Hogarth on her associates Linda Chao and Steven Benowitz, choosing to lure out secrets while staying on their good sides. Ducasse also aided Walker in locating Karl Malus through the location data that was left on images taken from Jones' cellphone. - Expert Tactician: Though they were all seasoned war veterans, the Howling Commandos took instruction from Carter on how to infiltrate the Red Room Academy, following her leadership on how to divide the men and what to do in a given situation. Though both leaders of their respective branches of the SSR, Thompson and Sousa referred to Carter's plan to fight Whitney Frost. When uneasy about Billy Koenig, Triplett was told by Skye that Coulson trusted him; Triplett accepted that without question. When given an order to apprehend Grant Ward, though Melinda May was mission commander, Triplett conferred with Coulson as to his course of action. Also, when Leo Fitz felt that Coulson was giving him busy work, Triplett reassured him that Coulson had a plan and does not give frivolous orders. Terrible liar, bright outlook on life, often tries to see the best in any situation and then trying to make it better. Deep affection, refuses to let people sacrifice their lives for her. Thinks there is always hope, does not accept that survival is all that matters. Attractive nerd, science buff, calm and rational, very forgiving, relies on what is or isn't scientific fact. Attracted to men who are heroic and save her and defend her and who constantly risk their well-being on her behalf. Likes homework more than life itself, genius-level intellect, possesses two PhDs in biochemistry, sharp and bright mind focused on analysis that allowed her to research and develop many breakthrough equipment. Highly gifted and knowledgeable in many fields of science such as biology, biochemistry, anatomy, and physics.

Adept combatant, able to fend for herself, very confident in her ability to fight, able to free herself from being held at gunpoint and can steal the gun off her enemy. Felt that mankind was filled with nothing but selfish desires. She selflessly submitted herself to the will of others less advantaged than herself and felt that her resentment was proof of her wickedness. She no longer possessed the ability to feel emotion and she became nothing but indifferent toward life. Any emotion that succeeded in breaching her mental barrier faded quickly and she no longer cared whether she continued to live or die. When she fell in love, she came to value all that he valued, and love all that he loved. She would still put on her old ways as a mask in times of desperate need, she fell deeply in love with him and went to extraordinary lengths to protect and assist him in everything that he did. In fact, so deep was her commitment to him and his ideals that the mere thought that she had failed him drove her to offer her life in supplication for her failure.

She believed it was her duty as Mord-Sith to lay her life down if need be for her Lord Rahl, though Richard had tried to curb her of this belief, feeling that she was family before she was his protector. Her fear of rats was a result of her early training as a Mord-Sith. When she was locked up in her cell rats would constantly gnaw at her feet until she learned to sleep with her feet curled up. When she got her next meal she believed that if she left food for the rats they would stop bothering her. Unfortunately for her, it was not the case and they pestered her more. So she concluded that she must eat her meal and endure the rats. Frodo, as described by Gandalf, was \"taller than some and fairer than most, (with) a cleft in his chin: perky chap with a bright eye.\" (The Fellowship of the Ring, Chapter 10, \"Strider\") He was a shy, young hobbit with thick, curly brown hair like most other hobbits, and had lighter-than-usual skin due to his Fallohide ancestry through his Brandybuck mother. He could be described as fairly good looking for a hobbit. Frodo is described as appearing thirty-three, even when he is fifty, due to the influence of the Ring. Bilbo and Frodo shared a common birthday on September 22, but Bilbo was 78 years Frodo's senior. At the opening of The Fellowship of the Ring, Frodo and Bilbo were celebrating their thirty-third and eleventy-first (111th) birthdays, respectively. Frodo, like Bilbo, was considered by many others in Hobbiton to be a little odd. His curiosity of the outside world, fascination with Elves and faraway places (like those to which Bilbo traveled in The Hobbit) did not fit the general content personality of most Hobbits. This curiosity was also attributed to his Took ancestry. He was very kind and compassionate, pitying Gollum and allowing him to guide him and Sam to Mordor despite Sam's distrust of the creature. This act of kindness later proved to be a factor in the quest's success in destroying the Ring. The influence of the Ring and the wound by the Morgul knife seems combined to have given him the ability to see into the spirit world, for instance he sees faraway events in his dreams on several occasions. He also can see the ring of power worn by Galadriel and he seems to be able to sense danger. Elite and ruthless, stealthy, infiltration, holds a grudge. Does not hurt people unless she has to. Due to the years of chronic pain Starr experienced as a result of this, she was desperate enough to do anything to permanently fix her condition, especially when she learned that she had only a few weeks to live. Starr's limited time to live, chronic pain, and desperate need to survive pushed her to act with extreme aggression and impatience. She was planning to extract Janet van Dyne's quantum energy despite the fact the process could potentially kill Janet and even considered kidnapping Cassie Lang as leverage to force Scott Lang to give her the Mobile Laboratory. Starr was unwilling to hear pleas of more peaceful yet uncertain means of curing her condition, as she was acutely aware of her limited lifespan. Having been promised a cure by S.H.I.E.L.D. that was not delivered made Starr distrustful of anyone who urged patience and vague plans for a cure to her condition. Although she shares a somewhat familial bond with Bill Foster, who assisted her in attempting to find a cure, she violently threw him aside when he tried to stop the quantum energy extraction. - \"We're a team. I'd do anything for this little guy.\" - Mike Peterson to Skye[src] A good person at heart, a family man, violent and unpredictable outrage. Stable, hard-working ethics, rescues people, able to retain her original personality. Thinks of herself as a hero, only wants to look out for the little guys, only attempted to fight against the system, common sense. Strong sense of loyalty, sarcastic sense of humor, thinly veiled disgust at those who betray. Not heartless by nature, acts ruthlessly to survive, sense of morality, feels shame for her actions, feels remorse for committing actions that are not beneficial, capable of showing compassion and regard for others' well-being, brutal exterior. Ultimately, Peterson's love for his son is what caused him to listen to reason, eventually calming himself down from his Centipede-induced rage and joining S.H.I.E.L.D. to hone his newfound enhanced-abilities. However, Peterson became deeply remorseful over his actions, having his son witness him as a monster led him to feel undeserving of his love and cut off connection for as long as possible due to shame. Peterson's love for him was so much that he was prepared to kill or even die for him, when HYDRA also exploited this by kidnapping Ace, he was forced to kill on John Garrett's orders and did such with tremendous regret. When broken free of Garrett's control, Peterson became wracked with guilt again and wished to do further good to make amends for his actions and for Ace. This is best exemplified when she urges Foster to abandon her, warning him that he will also be pursued by the authorities if he continues to act as her caretaker. Also, despite what the Pym family's actions caused her, Starr was willing to accept help from them and seems to be on much better terms with them after Janet returns and they begin extracting quantum energy to gradually cure her quantum illness. Knee breeches, shirt, waistcoat, jacket, cloak, bright green and yellow clothing, pocketknife. When his little group was waylaid by Barrow-wights, he lost his summer-weight clothing and was wearing a burial shrift when rescued by Tom Bombadil. When their pack-ponies returned, he was forced to put on heavier woollen clothing intended for colder weather. The Hobbits found several long D\u00fanedain daggers in the wight's treasure. These served as short-swords for the Hobbits, but Frodo's was broken when he resisted the Witch-king at Weathertop. At Imladris, he removed his Hobbit clothing upon finding new Elven clothes that fitted him perfectly. Therefore, throughout his quest, he wore a green silk tunic, trousers together with cloaks made of fur for the first stages of the quest, and then towards Mordor he shed them to wear his tunic and trousers in the warmer weather. Later, his uncle Bilbo gave him both Sting, a magic Elven dagger, and a coat of mithril chain mail. The mail saved his life twice, first when it deflected a spear-point in the Mines of Moria, and second when it turned aside the dagger that Saruman used to try and kill him. Camouflage cloak, true hero, rustic love, repeatedly saves friends from disaster. The relationship between Frodo and Sam was, in many respects, at the centre of The Lord of the Rings. To the modern reader, it seems archaic - it is clearly extremely class-oriented: Sam's humbleness and \"plain speaking\" is frequently emphasized in contrast to Frodo's \"gentility\", and he often shows deference to Frodo, calling him \"Mister Frodo\". At the same time, a strong bond of love and trust grows between them, portrayed most poignantly during the events of Cirith Ungol, where Sam vows to return to his (apparently) dead master, to be reunited with Frodo in death. Tolkienologists regard Sam as Frodo's batman. In the British Army, a batman was an orderly who acted as the personal servant of an officer. It was a role with which Tolkien (who served as an Army officer in the First World War) would have been extremely familiar. Sam undertakes all of the typical roles of a batman - he runs errands for Frodo, he cooks, he transports him (or at least carries him), and he carries his luggage. Tolkien confirmed this interpretation when he wrote in a private letter that: \"My Sam Gamgee is indeed a reflexion of the English soldier, of the privates and batmen I knew in the 1914 war, and recognized as so far superior to myself\" \u2014J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography, page 89, ed. Humphrey Carpenter. Compare with the relationship between Don Quixote and his squire Sancho Panza, and the gradual \"Quixotization\" of Sancho. Jim Butcher also describes Samwise in his book Changes: Resisted the most terrible temptation in the world for the sake of a friend that she loved, faced great foes with courage, went alone into a dark land and stormed a fortress. Very friendly and well-mannered, fond of food, drink, a full pipe, her friends, and good cheer, known for greeting strangers and friends with hospitality, at people's service, fond of adventure and wandering, secretly relished having adventures, wants to remain settled. Happy with her life and content to remain. The most beautiful, her beauty is beyond description, her face radiates light, in light is her power and her joy. Knew people's minds well and feared for this. Stars and constellations, collected dew, filled lamps with light. Revered and loved, her name is invoked when people require aid and sing her praises when the stars rise, can hear more clearly than any other ears, answers prayers. The recent appearance of the Sun and Moon had prompted Morgoth to blanket the sky above Angband with nigh-impenetrable clouds of ash and smoke to shield his servants. However, Morgoth's legions were at that time still too daunted by the new lights to emerge from Angband, and remained underground in their totality. Aided by the ashen darkness and the absence of Morgoth's servants above ground, Fingon managed to reach Thangorodrim unmolested. But seeing that he could not enter Angband by any means, he began to sing a song in defiance of the Orcs hiding within Angband. Maedhros heard this song, and began to sing with Fingon, and thus Fingon managed to locate him upon the slopes of Thangorodrim. But when he reached the foot of the precipice from which Maedhros hung, he found that there was no way to reach Maedhros to free him. Seeing that there was nothing Fingon could do to help him, and being in agony without hope of respite, Maedhros begged Fingon to shoot him. Fingon made to do as Maedhros wished, but before he loosed his arrow, he prayed to Manw\u00eb to grant speed to the arrow for Maedhros's sake. Fingon's plea for mercy was heard by Thorondor, the King of Eagles, who stayed Fingon's hand and flew him to Maedhros. But Fingon was neither able affect the metal band from which Maedhros hung nor draw it from the precipice. Maedhros begged Fingon for death once again, but Fingon instead severed Maedhros's hand above the wrist and Thorondor bore them both away from Thangorodrim. Maedhros made a swift recovery but never forgot his torment, which drove him to become an even deadlier swordsman with his left hand than he had ever been with his right. In gratitude for his rescue, and in atonement for F\u00ebanor's betrayal, Maedhros relinquished all claim as the heir of Finw\u00eb and made his uncle Fingolfin, Fingon's father, High King of the \u00d1oldor, something his brothers did not take well to. Maedhros openly acknowledged this action as being proper, as Fingolfin was the oldest living son of Finw\u00eb and was therefore next in line for the throne. Fingon rescuing Maedhros from one of the Thangorodrim Seeing that the more ill-tempered of his brothers were likely to cause feuds with their kinsmen, Maedhros moved all of them and their people out of Hithlum, and later ruled the lands around the Hill of Himring, which became known as the March of Maedhros. He established there a mighty fortress, not only to separate his rash and fiery brothers from the people of Fingolfin, but because he wished to have any attack from Angband fall first upon him. Allied with Fingolfin, he helped the High King win the battle of Dagor Aglareb. He stood with Fingolfin for nearly 300 years until the Dagor Bragollach, and thanks to his daring deeds during the battle, Himring stood while many other Elven realms fell. After a time, he even managed to re-secure the Pass of Aglon over which the fortress of Himring stood, and denied the forces of Morgoth entry into Beleriand through the March. Maedhros and Maglor prepared to fight and die after stealing the Silmarils after the War of Wrath Several years later, Maedhros and his brothers learned that Dior of Doriath, son of L\u00fathien and Beren, had inherited the Silmaril that her grandparents had recovered from Morgoth. Still driven by the Oath, Maedhros allowed Celegorm to convince him to attack Doriath. During the battle, Celegorm, Caranthir, and Curufin were slain, as was Dior, King of Doriath. Dior's sons, Elur\u00e9d and Elur\u00edn, were captured and abandoned by Celegorm's cruel servants in the forests around Doriath. Maedhros bitterly regretted this deed, and he long searched for the innocent youths but could not find them. After learning that Dior's daughter Elwing had survived and had taken the Silmaril with her, he and his surviving brothers descended with an army upon the remnants of the people of Doriath living in the Havens of Sirion. The \u00d1oldorin princes killed many Elves and captured Elwing's sons Elrond and Elros in the sack, but she and her husband E\u00e4rendil escaped to the West with the jewel. Heartsick with the burden of the Oath and the deeds he had participated in to see it fulfilled, Maedhros and his brother Maglor took Elwing's sons under their protection. Maedhros casts himself in the fiery chasm, by Jenny Dolfen After the War of Wrath, he and his last surviving brother, Maglor, demanded the jewels from E\u00f6nw\u00eb but were denied, as they were judged by the Maia to be unworthy of the jewels due to their heinous acts. However, driven onward by the Oath, Maedhros convinced Maglor of the necessity of fulfilling it. As such, one night the two brothers snuck into the camp of the victorious Host of Valinor, slew the guard around the jewels and laid hands upon them. The camp was roused, and the brothers prepared to die defending their claim, but E\u00f6nw\u00eb ordered the brothers to be spared, and they left the camp unharmed. But because of the evil deeds committed by the brothers to regain the jewels, they burned Maglor's and Maedhros' hands. Unable to bear the suffering, Maedhros cast himself and the Silmaril he carried into a fiery chasm in the Earth. Well-shaped, of beautiful bodily form, copper auburn hair.

Armed with an Elven blade, Gandalf was as valiant a fighter as the other swordsmen in the Fellowship, in no way hindered by his elderly appearance when fighting or riding. Gandalf reaped Orcs and other servants of evil with his blade, and slew the Balrog in a duel, though he perished as well. He is rendered even more formidable by his magic. Gandalf killed a squad of Goblins with lightning during the quest to slay Smaug, then hurled lightning and fire at the Nazg\u00fbl when he was attacked on Weathertop--something noticed for miles around and that seared the battlefield. Gandalf described himself as \"a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor\". Coincidentally, many of his spells were based on light and fire. He was able to light a faggot of wet wood simply with a touch of his staff, which he considered distinctive enough that any onlooker would recognize his handiwork. Gandalf purged the room of the Great Goblin with blue glowing smoke which scattered piercing white sparks to kill the Orcs. He could cause the tip of his staff to glow with bright white light so as to see in the dark and increase the radiance at will, as demonstrated in Moria. Gandalf could conjure sparks, such as to light pinecones on fire, and could choose any color for his flames. When fighting a pack of wolves, he set fire to all treetops on a hill with a single blazing branch, and the air became so hot that an arrow burned mid-flight. At the cost of shattering his staff, he was able to conjure a sea of white flames that caused the bridge under the feet of Durin's Bane to crumble. Gandalf the Grey has command over a great array of spells for all situations, such as magically healing wounds (though he stated Elrond was a better healer), being able to enhance Elrond's flood spell by giving the water the appearance of galloping knights, and seal doors shut or open them, although it should be noted that he was unable to open the Doors of Durin prior to remembering the password. During the Battle of Five Armies, Gandalf amplified his voice to be heard by the armies of Men, Elves, and Dwarves. Gandalf could control the color and shape of smoke, such as to make a cloud of smoke float around himself. Moreover, Gandalf could manipulate the taste of beer, and he stated that Durin's Bane nearly overpowered him with its counterspell, forcing him to rely on a word of Command that resulted in a blast which caused the ceiling of the room beyond the door to collapse. Gandalf also could make illusions such as when he covered Bilbo's use of the One Ring at his party. Gandalf once had a comprehensive knowledge of Orc, Elf, and Manish magic, at least for the defending and locking of places, and while he had forgotten many of these spells by the time of the War of the Ring, he still had a firm grasp of many. Gandalf the White displayed these same powers, but more advanced and with a few more spells. When he first met Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas in his new form, he shocked and quickly overpowered them with his agility and magic: he effortlessly disarmed the former two, one by causing his sword to burst into flames, the other by pulling the axe from his hands with a wave of his staff, and burnt the Elf's arrow into nothing when the latter loosed it. Shortly afterwards, he said that he had recently battled Sauron's eye to prevent him from locating Frodo, and although successful, the confrontation left him spent. Gandalf's mere presence was frightening to those who were about him if the White Wizard willed it and his voice could stun weaker beings or cause them to hesitate. Gandalf the White could force others to obey his orders, as he demonstrated against Gimli and Saruman. He also displayed the ability to communicate with horses and was able to reach Shadowfax with his mind. Gandalf's control over lighting and shadows increased after his return, as he was able to strike down Gr\u00edma Wormtongue without really harming the man, just after controlling the darkness in a whole room to remove the light as a show of power. He later displayed the ability to focus raw light (called the \"white fire\") into beams and blasts to drive off the Ringwraiths and these attacks were so powerful that only the Witch-king dared to duel Gandalf, using this spell caused Gandalf's eyes to glow. Gandalf also telekinetically disarmed Denethor and was able to increase his physical strength, without needing to speak spells. Finally, he also shattered Saruman's staff, and thus stripped the rogue wizard of his divine/magical power, save the power of Saruman's voice. Angelic presence, medicinal knowledge, considered one of the most powerful, golden yellow hair, great bodily strength and heroism, loved dearly, capable leader, very courageous, mindful of refugees, chose to protect, would have defended fugitives of any rank.

Never spoke of her lost loved ones, as if they never existed, wields a broadsword skillfully against the forces of evil, initially intensely reluctant to participate in a fight.

Aware of her errors, humble, touched, change of heart, stayed to aid people, regrets her mistakes, loves them more than anything else in the world, hand on heart and offer it; gesture of affection and farewell, accepts peoples decisions.

Courageous, talented, thirsts to prove herself. Extremely brave, loyal, and selfless, possesses tremendous strength of character. Very strong-willed and unafraid to stand up for herself. Able to love unequivocally, perfectly prepared to put her friends' needs and best interests first, ended relationships due to her concern for their well being, the amount of trust that she put into her friends was so strong that she absolutely refused to consider that any of them would betray her. Has a weakness for heroics, would go to great lengths and take great risks in order to help others, particularly her loved ones. Willingly went to what she truly believed was her death because she believed it was the only way to defeat her enemy. The closeness that Harry felt for many was great enough for him to behave violently if any of them were harmed. When his godfather was murdered by Bellatrix Lestrange, Harry attacked her in a grief-stricken rage of righteous anger and attempted to use the Cruciatus Curse on her. He also attacked Severus Snape after the latter murdered Dumbledore. Ironically, the only people with whom Harry ever initiated a duel were Snape and Bellatrix and he only desired to do so right after they killed someone he loved. This highlights Harry's bravery even further because Harry was fully aware that Snape and Bellatrix were two very skilled and experienced duellists, but did not hesitate to harm them as soon as he was pushed into it. This can also happen if a loved one of his is, even if it isn't true, insulted in front of him, as he so enraged he was seriously considering attacking Albus Dumbledore himself when he stated he believed Sirius was wrong to have treated Kreacher the way he did and that he was trying to keep Sirius alive by keeping him in 12 Grimmauld Place, as Harry believed that Dumbledore had no right, despite knowing fully well he was completely outmatched by Dumbledore, whom he acknowledged to be the greatest wizard in history, but fortunately for Harry Dumbledore did not resort to such means and calmly levelled with him. Voldemort was considered by many to be 'the most evil wizard in hundreds and hundreds of years'. His evil nature far exceeded that of any common evildoer and Dumbledore stated that he 'went beyond normal evil' in the extent of his crimes. Hagrid claimed that while all Dark wizards 'go bad', Voldemort went 'worse than worse'. Indeed, Voldemort speedily developed into a power-obsessed megalomaniac of the worst kind and the worst of any known Dark wizard, being considered by all to be far more evil than even Gellert Grindelwald. He was unable and unwilling to express remorse or empathy for the countless crimes he had committed. This was a stark contrast to Grindelwald, who proved to display genuine remorse for his crimes and even before his fall, pity for those abused for their magic and even if only a little, care for his followers, all which Voldemort completely lacked. These anti-social traits were seen in his childhood, from stealing to disturbing incidences with other orphans. Dumbledore stated that the young Riddle had a certain disregard for rules. In his adult life, he performed the darkest forms of magic and had no regard for human life. He was a prolific killer, as seen by his killing so many that he created an army of Inferi. Voldemort also did not believe in the concept of good and evil, as he made clear to Harry in their encounter at the Mirror of Erised, and that only power and 'those too weak to seek it' truly mattered. Highly intelligent, top performance at school, tremendous achievements, interest narrowly focused on the usefulness of people, object, and powers to her goals, unable to see the larger picture, and does not pay attention to events, powers, and human traits that are not immediately useful to her, murders without remorse. After his first defeat, many (namely Hagrid, Dumbledore, Neville's grandmother among others) believed that he had yet to be truly vanquished, and would one day return on the grounds that there was not enough humanity left in him to die in the first place. At the same time, due to his excessive evil and brutality, others (namely Cornelius Fudge and a good deal of the wizarding world) would deny he was still alive for a sense of self-comfort, until evidence was given to their very eyes. During his lifetime, including much of his childhood, he was shown to be highly ruthless, cruel, merciless, and sadistic, showing as little mercy to his followers as he did his enemies. According to Dumbledore, he felt no desire or need for human companionship or friendship. The closest he came to caring about another living being was feeling affection for his pet snake, Nagini. Thought of everything in terms of power (which she equated to domination through ability). She was somewhat willfully ignorant of people or matters which she considered to have no value. Had a need for independence that bordered on pathological, and she preferred to operate in secrecy and solitude whenever possible. Dumbledore claimed that even if he had managed to obtain the Elixir of Life, he would have eventually found his dependency on it intolerable because it would have robbed him of his sense of self-reliance. Instead, he preferred to make Horcruxes, which were magical extensions of himself. Voldemort was a sociopathic narcissist, to the point that he frequently referred to himself in the third person as 'Lord Voldemort'. He detested being common, as when he heard of another person named Tom, he expressed his dislike; Voldemort always considered himself unique and above all others due to his magical powers among an orphanage of Muggles, his rare ability to speak Parseltongue among his schoolmates, and his own esteemed lineage as the Heir of Slytherin. Ironically, Voldemort's actions to ensure his own league of fame made him no different from any tyrant who would come to fear the ones they oppressed. It was said that if Voldemort looked into the Mirror of Erised, he would see himself, all-powerful and eternal. Tricks and blackmails people, is well-practiced at operating in secrecy. Despite her independent streak, she would not completely reject all assistance, if only she was forced into a desperate measure. Aside from his desperate times, Voldemort would also rely on his Death Eaters and army of versatile beings to do his bidding, knowing that he could not overtake the Ministry all by himself (or with only a small handful of Death Eaters), or depend on them to handle the more trivial matters that he did not think was worth his effort. He even trusted the conquered Ministry of Magic to his army while he would focus on other matters personally. He entrusted two of his precious Horcruxes to his lieutenant Death Eaters, Bellatrix Lestrange and Lucius Malfoy, knowing they have the resources and skills to provide satisfactory security, but did not tell them the truth of these unholy artefacts, furthering his reliance on their skills over any genuine trust. Overall, Voldemort's need for solitude and independence is not so much as doing absolutely everything himself, but to make use of everyone around him to the fullest without ever gaining any sentimental attachment to them, as he was easily prepared to discard anyone or anything once they fulfilled their purpose. Had very little attachment to anything that does not amplify her fame or existence, views her followers as nothing more than disposable pawns to carry out her tasks only valuing their usefulness and physical abilities, views her soul as precious, thinks objects of extreme fame or importance are worthy of her. Did not believe in anyone but herself, nor did she value her fellow human beings except to the extent that they were useful to her. He often described his followers as 'friends' and his Death Eaters even as 'family', but in no way treated them like an ordinary person does with their friends or family. He demanded his followers' unswerving loyalty and obedience, spitefully took revenge for their mistakes or even bad luck by torture or going after family members, and mistreated or even killed them at the slightest provocation. His cold-blooded murder of the man he believed to be one of his most powerful and useful followers, Severus Snape, just to be sure he was the true master of the Elder Wand and his callous attempt to sacrifice Draco Malfoy by ordering him to assassinate Dumbledore as punishment for Lucius Malfoy's blunders, are evidence of this. He was, however, capable of rewarding his followers should they aid him, as he, when otherwise admonishing Wormtail for having fear act as his motivating factor in returning to Voldemort instead of genuine loyalty to him, nevertheless supplied him with a silver hand to replace the one he lost when restoring Voldemort to life, specifically citing that Wormtail had nevertheless proved his usefulness in the past few months. Determined, stubbornly persisted in seeking justice within a system where injustices exist. Used to think that all she had to do was follow the rules, tell the truth, and justice would be served. Skilled in hand-to-hand combat. - Expert Marksman: Madani is extremely skilled in the use of firearms, particularly pistols, shotguns and assault rifles. She is especially accurate with her sidearm, managing to fire a warning shot at the Punisher at the railing of the staircase he was going down at Royal Hospitality, just barely missing him. She also killed Spencer Geiger with her service shotgun during an ambush, and showcased tight grouping with the three bullets she put in Billy Russo and the two in Brett Mahoney's vest. Brutish appearance, serious demeanor, seemingly unquenchable murderous rage, sense of honor, calm mind capable of strategy and refined eloquence, capable of elaborated speech filled with vocabulary like a thesaurus, severe lack of understanding for metaphors and symbolism. His rage and hatred for Ronan the Accuser often made him highly impatient with his new teammates when he did not see that they could beat Ronan. This made him act without thinking of the consequences, such as getting Ronan to come to Knowhere in order to fight him, which lead to Ronan obtaining the Orb, nearly destroying his friends, and eventually lead to the Battle of Xandar and near destruction of the planet at Ronan's hands. He felt great remorse towards his rashness and selfishly endangering others for his own vengeance, prompting him to work better with his team. However, his vengefulness then made him want to kill Thanos when he rationalized that Ronan was only a puppet. His wrath, as well as his calm demeanor, also hide his sadness and grief over his family, though Mantis was able to sense and experience it and was driven to tears while Drax remained outwardly unfazed, only showing some somberness. calm nature in most situations, Though his warrior mentality caused him to appear brooding and serious, Drax expressed an immature and childish excitement for battle and adventure and was often thrilled when faced with dangerous and tense situations. As such, he was laughing jovially when fighting guards at the Kyln and when crashing into the Dark Aster with his team. Drax has an uncanny affinity for knives, making them his weapon of choice in most situations, regardless of the size and type of foes he fought unless forced otherwise. It was so well known that Moloka Dar attempted to appease him by offering Drax his own. Despite this, he was willing to use other weapons, such as the Hadron Enforcer. dyed platinum blond hair that reaches her shoulders and a mole under her left eye. notably shorter than most people around her. handsome, lanky, and tall young, with shaggy black hair. wears casual clothing. long, slightly messy light-colored hair and sharp features with a distinctive mole under her left eye. prominent and dark. Chishiya is mostly seen sneering even when he is angry unless he becomes emotional or regretful, which occurs only a few times. Heavily intense or horrific events don't ever have him falter. The only times in the series he's ever seen truly disturbed is the aftermath of the Witch Hunt and at the death of Keiichi Kuzuryu. He is calm, highly intelligent and manipulative, and analytical at all times, making him a potentially strong Hearts and Diamonds player, even though he claimed to not be suited for Hearts. This allows him to triumph in games that require defeating other players, yet because he declares to be uninterested in understanding the human heart, Diamond games remain his strong suit. His capabilities to remain so calm in dangerous situations stems from the fact that he has no interest in the concept of life, both his own and others. To others, the Borderlands are a situation of life or death, but to him the games are just simple games. The truth is, he lacks a will to live. He doesn't know what he's living for, and was just interested in finally finding someone that was \"interesting\" in the Borderlands. Although he acts cocky, it's clear he doesn't like himself for who he is. He couldn't help shunning people's good will and intentions, he couldn't get by without hurting and manipulating someone. For what purpose does he live? He says that in the end, he feels like he only existed to demonstrate \"just how empty a human can be.\" expert sense of observation and recollection. During the 5 of Spades, he was able to spot the tagger almost immediately, and was able to make the connection that the bullet marks from him shooting across the building was a sign of him defending the correct door. He was also able to discern Aguni's change of expression when viewing the black envelope, as well as his glance towards the deer painting, using both these facts down the line to steal the cards from the Beach. Due to her experience with mountain climbing, muscular body and great physical endurance. She still trains to maintain her physical ability by running. Arisu is shown to have long-medium length, bluish-black/darkish blue/black hair that is extremely messy and spiky. He also has light neon violet/blue colored eyes. His skin is pale colored and he's usually seen wearing his high school uniform (a white long-sleeved shirt with a red t-shirt inside and a blue-colored pants with a light soil colored belt with pale aquamarine sneakers) amazing analyzer, Arisu is able to look at things from afar and checks every detail he can find. He keeps track of everything in the he learns to find a way to put an end to this twisted game. deep observational skills lack of self-confidence and pent up frustration. He would often daydream and wish that he and his friends would go far away from reality, from his overly demanding father and stuck up younger brother. Though he is shamed for being dumb, he actually is quite intelligent in terms of street smarts Regardless of his father, he's able to enjoy life and forget all of his worries when he's with his two best friends, Chota Segawa and Daikichi Karube, both of which are with him in Borderland. When he's with them, he's able to be very silly and carefree. Whenever he loses his sanity to the games, he always thinks of his friends, their sacrifices, and his promise to them. However, Arisu is capable of being extremely selfish, and that is mainly due to the little attention and love he received as a child. He thought that he would be incapable of giving love since he never received it, and his trauma gradually manifested through his time in the Borderlands. He was angry at Yuzuha Usagi when she rejected his advances, got his friends together to attempt to clear the King of Clubs on the First Day of Exhibitions due to how desperately he seeked the answer, and paired Usagi with the man who raped her, Suguru Niragi, all because he was afraid to endure the ensuing awkwardness of being paired together with her. Everything he did was about him, and he always thought of himself. For a long time, he never realized this. It wasn't until Ginji Kyuma talked to him mentally, and Niragi savagely teared into all his flaws, that he finally realized how selfish he was. After that moment, he began working on himself, wanting to change. He began to consider that it wasn't always what he wanted to do, but what others wanted to do to. In the end, he said without the slightest hesitation to Usagi in the Queen of Hearts that she is who kept him afloat, and he would be willing to lay down his life without a single moment of hesitation. a highly experienced martial artist, a proficient swordsman, superior sense of agility and dexterity, which gave her an advantage in hand-to-hand combat. tall, lean male with long black hair that is put into a half-up bun for the entirety of the Beach arc. He has silver piercings on his left eyebrow, left nostril, helix and his tongue. He wears a black-and-white giraffe print long-sleeved shirt and the first few buttons are undone. In Chapter 17, he is wearing black pants and boots, but for the rest of the Beach arc, he is wearing black swim shorts and is barefoot. He is often seen holding a gun against his shoulder. barefoot, bandages wrapped around her arms and torso. stubborn, narcissistic, filled with hatred and acidity. seemingly only acts on impulse, only doing things if she deems them fun or not and lives for excitement, whether negative or positive.

When she gets close to someone, she trusts them. sense of determination. wanted to live life to the fullest, and carry on her friends. wanted to go to college, and get a good job. She often encourages her comrades and is strong both physically and mentally. Alongside her strength, she is rather smart and easily picks up on plans and ideas. She can go alone independently but also can work as a team. Mental calculation: One of Chishiya's strongest faucets was his abilities in mental math, which gave him a huge leverage in the 6 of Diamonds and King of Diamonds. In Blackjack, he was able to use the chip[s as an abacus to invent a mathmatical formula to follow when betting to maximize his probability of earnings. During the Beauty Contest, after he predicted Daimon's choice of 62, he was then able to estimate the number he should pick, then deduce his selection to 23 to have the exact average. Reading people: He was skilled in taking in people's demeanor and personality, and using it to predict how they would act. During Arisu's stay at the Beach, he took advantage of his well-meaning nature, using it to his advantage to steal the cards. Later, in the King of Diamonds, he was able to tap into the minds of both Daimon and Kuzury, able to see Daimon's frankness and Kuzury's sense of justice, using both to his advantage. Chishiya believes that humans are unconcerned and selfish by nature. However, his belief gradually changes after witnessing the selfless acts of Ryohei Arisu, Yuzuha Usagi, and especially Kuzury. Seeing those people and everything they did, he became interested in that prospect and wanted to try being \"uncharacteristic\" instead of wasting his days away, which is what led to him jumping in front of Usagi to take a bullet. He has proven to have a good heart. During the tag game, he tried to warn everyone about where the tagger is, which Usagi complimented him on. During the seven of hearts game, his first instincts was not to betray anyone, but trying to calm everyone and figuring out a way so that everyone can live. He had told Chishiya that the reason why he is living right now is that he aims to get back to the real world with everyone due to Usagi's motivating words. As of season one, he seems most skilled at playing for Heart cards, after realizing their intention is to turn everyone against each other and make the victor feel like a fool.

Although Drax has grown fond of his teammates, his social skills leave much to be desired as he called Gamora a \"green whore\" when telling her she is his friend along with the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy. Ironically, he will not hesitate to harm or even kill anyone who insults his friends, as he blasted Nebula with a rocket launcher as she was insulting Gamora, before calmly stating no one could speak to his friends in such a manner. Though unlikely to admit being so, he was shown time and again to have a soft side to him, enough to comfort his friend, Rocket Raccoon, when the latter seemingly lost his friend, Groot.

She investigated in finding the true cause of her former partner, Ahmad Zubair's death and claimed that the Punisher was involved. Dinah figured that asking Billy Russo would help so she got Carson Wolf to arrange a training session at Anvil to schedule a night out with him and find out about his and Castle's business of what they have done with their group in Afghanistan. Eventually, after recovering from her car crash from the Punisher, she reported to Homeland Security to head to the woods to find the corpse of Gunner Henderson, after Micro sent the coordinates to them. Then she found out that Henderson was one of the soldiers in Castle's group and wonders why Anvil soldiers were present in the woods, she goes to confront Russo at the water front and he lies to her about his unit being out there for other reasons. Later after that, she shortly followed a lead about an arms dealer that the Punisher might be in it and realized that it was Russo in disguise with people in his freelance fighting in a shootout then her friend, Sam Stein, was murdered.

Voldemort's main obsessions were immortality, pure-blood supremacy, the attempts on Harry Potter's life, and the search for the Elder Wand. This was reflected in his daily habits as well: he had a magpie-like tendency to collect lots of small objects and hold onto them. As a child, he is shown hoarding things that he stole from the other orphans, which eventually blossomed into his conception of the Horcruxes. This could also have been seen as trophy taking, a trait seen in serial killers. This was especially seen after a particularly cruel act, such as the incident at the Cave, and creating Horcruxes after killing. Dumbledore said to Harry in the Limbo King's Cross that his obsession with the Elder Wand was to rival his obsession with Harry himself. The Dark Lord stopped at nothing in his many attempts to kill Harry Potter. Few ever saw anything troubling about the young Tom Riddle, but Albus Dumbledore observed psychological issues and their potential dark implications from their very first meeting. Dumbledore described a 'magpie-like tendency' to collect trophies, as well as a need to obsess over his collection, that led him to make a correct guess at what was behind the secret of his immortality: multiple Horcruxes. Dumbledore noted a similarity between Voldemort and other famous tyrants, in that obsessive actions driven by paranoia can bring about the thing most feared. Tom Riddle remained charming and well-liked as a young adult, and at first seemed to be aiming lower on the scale of ambition than his talents would have supported. He used his stint at Borgin and Burkes to develop his knowledge of the Dark Arts, and to track and collect powerful magical objects. Only a few people ever had an ominous feeling about his imminent rise as a powerful dark wizard: Hepzibah Smith, who saw his eyes flash red with avarice when he saw her treasured artefacts, and, again, Albus Dumbledore, who refused to give him a job teaching at Hogwarts. realising he would use his influence as a teacher to recruit students and do evil. Despite his narcissistic nature, Voldemort could acknowledge his mistakes, as shown when he accepted the fact that the destruction of his body was more his fault then Harry's, even going so far to openly admit this to his Death Eaters. However, though Voldemort was capable of admitting his mistakes, Harry asserted that he didn't learn from them, especially relating to matters he did not value such as love. When he was angry, Voldemort was unpredictable: he was capable of being cold and calm, but could also explode with rage and when he lost his temper he never hesitated to slay even his own loyal followers. He expected complete respect from his Death Eaters but did not truly care for any of them in return. He did rescue Bellatrix Lestrange after his duel with Albus Dumbledore, and also screamed and attempted to avenge her after she was killed by Molly Weasley. It is likely, though, that he was furious about the loss of a very powerful and talented servant as well as the mother of his daughter Delphini, rather than truly missing Bellatrix as a person. Bellatrix herself was obsessively in love with him (incidentally, this somewhat mirrored the fascination that Voldemort's mother had with his father), but he never returned the romantic feelings due to his lack of understanding and desire for love, despite having engaged in a purely physical relationship with Bellatrix which resulted in the birth of their daughter. Deep under his terrifying demeanour, Voldemort was capable of fear whenever he didn't feel that things were completely in his control. On some occasions, such as when he tried to murder Harry while he was a defenceless baby, Voldemort displayed cowardice. He was also furious, yet terrified, when he found out that Helga Hufflepuff's Cup was stolen. Voldemort was also more afraid than Harry was when their wands underwent Priori Incantatem, although he refused assistance from his followers due to his desire to kill Harry unaided. Nevertheless, Voldemort was capable of suppressing and concealing his fears, and confronting the things that threatened him. When he entered Morfin Gaunt's home as a teenager and confronted his deranged uncle, even Harry could not help but admire Riddle's complete lack of fear when witnessing the event in Dumbledore's Pensieve. Gaunt was drunk, unstable and showed murderous inhumanity whilst wielding a knife in teenage Riddle's face, all of which nonplussed him. Voldemort was even bold enough to engage Albus Dumbledore in a duel, despite Dumbledore being the only wizard Voldemort was ever said to have feared. Voldemort was also a pathological liar and a hypocrite, even when he was a child. He was sadistic to other children in the orphanage where he grew up and opened the Chamber of Secrets while at Hogwarts, resulting in the death of a fellow student. When confronted by Dumbledore on both occasions he denied any involvement. He also lied to Slughorn about his reasons for wanting to gain knowledge on Horcruxes. A further example of this is how Voldemort deemed himself a 'Merciful Lord' with respect for his enemies, when in fact he considered everyone he had killed to be 'worthless (as he held no regard for them) and nameless' (he had killed so many that they became vague figures and not people with names to him) and used the words 'The more the better' regarding how many people died fighting his army. Despite this, he had an intense hatred of being lied to or anyone trying to deceive him or withhold the truth. As a child, he demanded that Dumbledore tell him the truth in such a forceful way that Dumbledore was deeply unsettled by the young wizard's demeanour. Upon mastery of Legilimency, he was able to easily tell whether he is being lied to from most people, and would warn them rather menacingly, as he snarled at Pettigrew for trying to deny his fear of the Dark Lord's mangled temporary body, and told Frank Bryce 'do not lie to Lord Voldemort'. However, despite Voldemort's general malicious ways, he had proven that he was capable of acknowledging the desires of others, but only if those desires did not interfere with his ambitions and were presented by someone whom he deemed a worthy servant. The only time this was ever really seen was when he agreed to Severus Snape's plea for Lily Evans' life. Although he did not agree to spare Lily unconditionally, he said he would offer her the chance to live if she did not attempt to stop him from murdering her son. Uncharacteristically, Voldemort followed through on his promise to Snape and gave Lily several chances to step aside. Doing this was what caused Lily's death to be a willing sacrifice, and in turn, is what protected Harry from Voldemort in the first place. One odd incident in Voldemort's life, discovered by Harry through an inadvertent mind-reading, occurred on the night he murdered Lily and James. As he walked down a Godric's Hollow lane on his way to their house, on his way to kill the infant Harry Potter, in a most unusual act of mercy, he decided to spare the life of a Muggle child who had complimented the impressiveness of his 'Hallowe'en costume', not realising that Voldemort was not in costume, but a black-robed wizard with a pale, snakelike face. Killing him was an act Voldemort had deemed 'unnecessary'. Voldemort's reasoning for this was not made clear, though it can be surmised that Voldemort had chosen not to use magic until he had arrived at the Potters' house in case his presence was detected by any spies. Another possibility is that Voldemort simply thought the child was not worth his time or effort. He also seemed to have respected, and sometimes even admired, bravery and skill, even when displayed by some of his enemies. After his return in 1995, he remarked to Harry that Harry's father had died 'straight-backed and proud'. Previously, at the end of Harry's first year at Hogwarts, he had referred to the Potters as 'brave' and said that James Potter 'put up a courageous fight'. During the Battle of Hogwarts, he appreciated Neville Longbottom's 'spirit and bravery' and wanted him to become a Death Eater, though this was also partially due to Neville being a pureblood. Although not caring for his Death Eaters, he did appreciate loyalty. When he learned that the Lestranges went to Azkaban rather than denounce him, Voldemort was so moved that he promised to reward them beyond their dreams. Similarly, when Harry seemed to take too long to arrive to offer himself to be killed to save the Hogwarts students and staff, he expressed some disappointment at Harry apparently abandoning the school to save himself, as he had hoped his ultimatum would ultimately drive Harry to be killed by him. Voldemort's obsession with blood purity also bred a strong disgust and hatred for the Muggle world. There are several indications \u2014 such as the statue Voldemort erected in the Ministry of Magic depicting Muggles being crushed \u2014 that Voldemort planned to manipulate and take over the Muggle government of Britain had he been successful. In addition, Voldemort, shortly after his return to physical form, told Harry about his Muggle family, only later to rebuke their memory and herald the return of his 'true family'. In his later life, Voldemort claimed that Muggle-borns were actually Muggles who stole magic from real wizards and witches, rather than actually inheriting it rightfully, and so deserved to be severely punished for it. Whether he knowingly made this theory up or truly believed it (or if he was the first proponent of it) is unknown. He ruthlessly murdered Charity Burbage for supporting Muggle-borns. Despite his racist beliefs, however, he allowed the werewolf Fenrir Greyback to join his cause, though he did not consider him an official Death Eater. It is also interesting to note that he was willing to allow Lily Potter to join him, despite the fact that she was Muggle-born. This showed that if the wizard or witch was exceptionally talented, Voldemort was capable of suppressing his hatred towards Muggle-borns and half-bloods, as long as they were willing to serve him. Voldemort's origins were extremely humble, even by Muggle standards: he grew up in an orphanage and his parents were the daughter of the Gaunts, the last decrepit, incest-ridden branch of the Slytherin family, and the son of a haughty, rich Muggle family, who was forced to marry and have a child with Merope. These humble origins made him an unlikely lightning rod for the wizarding aristocracy's pure-blood supremacist values, but due to his power, ability to trace his lineage directly to Salazar Slytherin, and willingness to give their cause a platform and an apparently sympathetic ally, he gained their support, and, in time, put them into a state of impressed terror that rendered their support unwavering. Voldemort found it useful to maintain a system of followers drawn from the Slytherin-centric Wizarding aristocracy, disaffected paupers with long-gone noble origins, as well as criminal elements, and in their company spoke like one of them, lecturing on themes of blood purity, Muggle inferiority, and the proper order of society. On one occasion, he even tortured and murdered a witch considered to be a blood traitor, Charity Burbage, for their pleasure. But Voldemort did not truly work for their cause, and only allowed them to set up a pure-blood supremacist regime at the Ministry of Magic for his own reasons: to control the government, to compensate them for their service and to ensure their continued loyalty. Voldemort's preoccupations were increasing his own dominion and stamping out opposition: the wizarding aristocracy's concerns were of no real interest to him. The alliance between Voldemort and the Death Eaters was a natural result of Voldemort's ancestry, of having been raised in Slytherin house, and of promises to help them achieve their ends, but there should be no mistake \u2014 Voldemort was merely using them. Despite claiming his actions were for the 'noble work' of purifying the wizarding race, there is evidence that Voldemort treated this with lesser importance than his preoccupations with immortality and domination. During his time studying at Hogwarts, while he used Slytherin's Basilisk to attack Muggle-born students, ultimately using the Basilisk to murder Myrtle, he didn't take credit for the crimes at the time, as doing so would result in getting him into trouble with the legal authorities of the magical community. He framed Rubeus Hagrid to both get away with his actions and to keep Hogwarts from closing down, which were both in his interests at the time. Knowing it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber of Secrets again with Dumbledore keeping a close eye on him, while he was still at school, he decided to create his Horcrux diary, with the intention of eventually repeating his actions through someone else. It was only after creating his identity of Lord Voldemort, that he began to openly acknowledge himself as the Heir of Slytherin, long after most people would have been able to link him to being both Tom Riddle and the one responsible for opening the Chamber of Secrets the first time round. This shows that while he does not full-heartedly support the pure-blood supremacy ideology (if only using it to enter the elite social circles), he does indeed hold Muggles and Muggle-borns with contempt for their alleged inferiority. Considered by many to be \"the most powerful wizard of all time\", Dumbledore was benevolent and wise, a great wizard in the vein of Merlin. He had an almost unearthly calm and relaxed demeanour and almost constantly gave off an aura of serenity and composure, rarely displaying intense emotions of anger or fear. He was known for typically speaking in a calm, collected voice, and being firm, but reasonable and kind. He was always courteous, even to people who he found rude or in the case of Fenrir Greyback, disgusting. However, despite his benign nature, it is said that Dumbledore was the only wizard Lord Voldemort ever truly feared. Dumbledore was notably eccentric. He was quite fond of knitting patterns and frequently wore flamboyant clothing (at one point, he is seen wearing a flowered bonnet that he received from a Wizard Cracker). In particular, he had a somewhat odd taste in sweets: he enjoyed Muggle sweets relatively unknown in the wizarding world (particularly sherbet lemons) and the password to his office, supposedly that of his current favourite sweet, was often peculiar choices such as Acid Pops and Cockroach Clusters. In addition, he had a liking for chamber music as well as ten-pin bowling. He often used humour to make people feel comfortable in his presence. In fact, his noted eccentricity may have been at least partly his using humour to appear less threatening. Dumbledore has been known to be quite philosophical; often, very few people have the understanding (or patience) to comprehend his philosophies. As a supremely talented wizard, Dumbledore showed numerous examples of extraordinary abilities. His capabilities as a wizard were combined with his extraordinary intellect and extremely cunning and subtle mind that allowed him to comprehend human nature and turn the better aspects of humanity (trust, love and friendship) to Voldemort's disadvantage in particular. Due to this, Dumbledore wielded extraordinary powers of deduction that allowed him to be completely unfooled by any charades who could fool even the entire wizarding world and recognise instantly any deception that may have initially fooled him at the slightest of slip-ups, as shown repeatedly when he quickly figured out Quirrell was distracting him with a letter he faked was from the Minister of Magic, was never fooled by Lockhart's books due to having knew what he truly was and quickly realised the truth, and deduced that Moody was actually Crouch Jnr the moment he asked Harry to be brought to his office. During his Hogwarts career, especially as Headmaster, Dumbledore always maintained his composure, even in situations that would terrify others. Being attacked by Ministry officials, the opening/reopening of the Chamber of Secrets, having Dementors at the school, being surrounded by a plethora of Inferi and soon thereafter, staring death in the face (although they may have made him uneasy for the safety of others) did not frighten him. This was shown best at his duel with Voldemort, when he engaged in small talk with him in a calm, almost sardonically humourous way, despite Voldemort's tremendous duelling prowess and his attempts to murder him. Dumbledore was verbally and utterly unafraid of death and was obviously never scared of Voldemort himself, but rather what he may/could do to those he cared for, and he was also not afraid of being exposed to great torment. An example of this was in The Cave, when knowing that the Potion would cause him severe pain and distress without knowing exactly what would happen to him, Dumbledore did not hesitate to drink it. Despite this, Dumbledore was capable of fear and feared, above all else, that he had actually cast the spell that ended his sister Ariana's life. However, he was capable of facing his fears, as shown by how he indirectly confessed his guilt to Leta Lestrange, and by how he later ultimately mustered the strength to confront Grindelwald and end the global wizarding war after years of watching Grindelwald's rampage. Therefore, Dumbledore's Boggart is said to be his sister's corpse. More than anything else, Dumbledore was motivated by his belief in the power of the human spirit. He also had a deep capacity for love, frequently reminding Harry that love was the greatest magic of all. Dumbledore believed in the good in everyone and insisted on giving second chances. He notably argued strongly against the expulsions of Newton Scamander, and later Rubeus Hagrid, as well as refraining from expelling Jacob's sibling, despite the latter repeatedly breaking school rules. Dumbledore also allowed Remus Lupin to be a pupil at his school and later a professor, despite the fact that Remus was a werewolf. He had a great friendship with Hagrid, despite many not trusting the half-Giant. The greatest example of this, however, is Dumbledore's relationship with Severus Snape, in whom Dumbledore was willing to hold a considerable amount of faith after Severus had shown remorse. Dumbledore even saw a possibility for good in Tom Riddle as a child, and was open to giving him a second chance, despite the fact that Tom had already revealed himself to be a cruel sociopath and bully even at a young age, though he kept a careful eye on Tom Riddle during his Hogwarts career rather than simply hoping for the best. Although he was devoted to Riddle's defeat after he became Voldemort, Dumbledore was genuinely regretful on how the days he could have easily intimidated Riddle into admitting his wrongdoings and taking responsibility for them were long gone, proving he felt a level of remorse for never managing to do anything significant to change Riddle. In addition, Dumbledore also believed the rumours of Grindelwald showing remorse for his crimes during his time in prison and showed a level of respect and gratitude for Grindelwald's concealment of the true location of the Elder Wand for a shred of redemption even if it was in vain. Albus Dumbledore in thought Dumbledore was highly perceptive and emotionally intelligent; his knowledge of people's true personality went beyond being simply a good judge of character. This is never more apparent than in his complex insights into Voldemort's psyche, which he pieced together with Harry to deduce where the Horcruxes were hidden. However, this insight also made him extraordinarily good at manipulating people, which he was perfectly willing to do if he thought it necessary. Perhaps the most blatant example of this was with regard to Severus Snape, as he used Snape's love for the late Lily Evans to manipulate him into helping him protect Harry Potter, her son, despite all the risks it entailed and despite Snape's bitterness and hatred towards Harry's father. Another note worth mentioning in this area, is Dumbledore conjured a bottle of gin to help ease Mrs Cole during their conversation. He did not offer her a glass, but simply produced it, knowing she would drink it. A lesser note of his emotional insight was with Gilderoy Lockhart: despite Lockhart having fooled every inhabitant in the wizarding world with his books, Dumbledore, having knew what he truly was, was completely unable to be tricked by Lockhart and he was able to effortlessly manipulate Lockhart into taking the job of DADA Professor by slyly hinting Harry Potter was in Hogwarts attending his second year so he can expose him. Dumbledore, while often kind and calm, did have a very serious side of himself and was capable of a terrifying wrath. This was rarely seen but appears to be well known and combined with his exceptional magical abilities, made very few of his allies willing to cross him and almost all of his enemies feared him, to the point that even Lord Voldemort and Gellert Grindelwald were known for fearing him, despite their own incredible magical powers, wrath and status as the two most dangerous Dark wizards in history. Even a slight exertion of Dumbledore's serious side and anger could intimidate the likes of Harry Potter, and even the Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge, evidenced when they both were shocked when Dumbledore made it clear quite firmly that Hagrid did not open the Chamber of Secrets, despite Dumbledore not openly showing anger. Additionally, rather than shouting when Harry entered Hogwarts with the Ford Anglia, and when Harry failed to get Slughorn's memory, just an expression of calm disappointment on both occasions was enough to make Harry feel ashamed to the point that he found it preferable if Dumbledore shouted at him. At the apex of Dumbledore's wrath, which happened extremely rarely, such as when he apprehended Barty Crouch Jnr, who impersonated Moody and almost killed Harry, Dumbledore was described as \"being struck with cold, ancient fury\". In fact, during this rare moment of intense anger (caused by Dumbledore's realisation that, not only had Voldemort been resurrected, but also that he had been expertly deceived for an entire year), Dumbledore was so terrifying, that even Minerva McGonagall and Severus Snape, both extremely powerful and stern wizards who rarely displayed emotions, were clearly uneasy. Harry himself (who was also rather terrified of his reaction) fully understood then why Dumbledore was the only wizard that Voldemort ever feared. In addition to being completely unintimidated but rather saddened by Harry's profound bursts of rage regarding Sirius (though Dumbledore knew full well he completely deserved Harry's anger), in all the other times Harry unleashed his anger, Dumbledore proved himself capable of quelling even Harry's anger with just a slight exertion of his dark side, as he silenced Harry's questions regarding his judgement of Draco and Snape and even silenced Harry's anger with just indicating he had crossed the line, showing even Harry's rage could not match the seriousness and fury the old but extraordinarily powerful wizard was capable of. Dumbledore's grief \u2014 Albus Dumbledore on the nature of regret[src] Dumbledore was haunted by his traumatic family history. In particular, he was riddled with guilt over the circumstances surrounding the death of his sister. He felt enormous remorse for his selfishness and was tortured for the rest of his life by the possibility that he might have been the one who cast the spell that killed his sister, to the point that he delayed facing Grindelwald until there was no other choice, due to him fearing what his former friend might have known about the death of Ariana. However, he had enough sense to realise that he will inevitably have to duel Grindelwald and therefore he took the position as the Professor of DADA to prepare students for the upcoming dark times. Additionally, Dumbledore's own guilt allowed him to comfort Leta Lestrange over her own guilt in the role she had in her brother Corvus' death. Indeed, it was Dumbledore's advice to Leta that induced her to save Credence Barebone from Yusuf Kama's revenge. He kept what he considered to be important information back even from his colleagues and superiors in the Ministry of Magic, such as his birthplace and which house he was sorted into during his attendance at Hogwarts. He was visibly saddened by the insanity of Alice and Frank Longbottom, noting how being dead would have be better than having to live the rest of their lives insane, and openly acknowledged he was never able to find it easy to get over the loss of a comrade and only by turning the sadness he felt into motivation to get justice was he able to move on, as seen by his expressing sympathy towards Jacob's sibling after they lost Rowan Khanna and even acknowledging he should have trained them well enough. He also had a well-known habit of being set off by sudden noises or movements in his presence and even attacked a witch who shouted \"boo\" at him on April Fools' Day. He even destroyed a birthday present carriage clock, believing it was a cleverly disguised basilisk egg, and was described in a Daily Prophet article as having left the Ministry when deemed \"Unable to tell the difference between a handshake and attempted murder.\" . Moody was a great wizard in his day and the most effective Dark wizard hunter that the Ministry of Magic ever had. Nearly half of the cells in Azkaban were full because of Moody. He had the ability to think like a Dark wizard, which helped him track so many down. This also allowed him to outwit Voldemort during the Battle of the Seven Potters where he accurately predicted that Voldemort would believe Harry to be guarded by the most powerful members. He was also a staunchly loyal friend and supporter of Albus Dumbledore and one of the Order of the Phoenix's most powerful and reliable allies. He despised those who practised the Dark Arts, labelling such people as \"filth\", and relished the idea of Dark wizards being left at the mercy of the Dementors. Over the course of the year, the mission also led Draco to neglect other aspects of his school life that he would previously have abused or enjoyed: he rejected his Prefect duties that he once would happily abuse; he feigned illness and paid another student to take over his stead in order to avoid playing Quidditch himself, as opposed to three years earlier when he would ensure the entire match was postponed by exaggerating a minor injury in order to suit the team's interest; he missed two Transfiguration homework assignments; he would distance himself from his friends Crabbe and Goyle and order them to be on lookout without telling them anything; and he would also spend less time mocking Harry and his friends despite the many opportunities. Ultimately, Draco was unable to kill Dumbledore, lowering his wand and being tempted to take Dumbledore's offer of protection for his parents. By the time Draco become an adult, he had became a noticeably changed man, due to his regret over joining the Death Eaters and the vile deeds he had to perform, even if only limited compared to his parents, and any of his old bigotry was lost, refusing to follow in line with the old pure-blood beliefs after having seen first-hand what happened to him and his parents for that. Due to this, he fell deeply in love with Astoria Malfoy despite the disappointments of his parents over her failing to meet their hopes of someone from one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. As a husband, Draco was very loving and devoted and was even fully willing to let the Malfoy bloodline end to protect her from her family's curse as it made childbirth dangerous and detrimental to her health, which he maintained even despite Lucius's dislike, only relenting after Astoria said she wanted to leave behind a child for him and not for family beliefs. His wisdom shone by the fact that even though the temptation of using his family's secret Time Turner to see his wife just for one more minute was admittedly great, his respect for her desires and memory were too great to risk jeopardising the timeline for his beloved, showing how deeply Draco had fallen in love with her, as even though he had the power to alter time to be with her, he was able to, even if barely, resist such overwhelming temptation, showing how much his character had changed by the age of forty. Although Scorpius's birth would cause Astoria's death, Draco's love for his son was clearly great, considering the day he was born the greatest day of his life. Having seen how his parents spoiled him had caused him to become such a horrible man in his younger days, Draco strove to do better and henceforth he raised his son to be a better person. He did not let his histories with Harry, Ron and Hermione hamper his judgement towards Scorpius's bond with Albus Potter and crush on Rose Granger-Weasley, children of his former rivals, fully supporting his son instead. His love for Scorpius was shown by how he showed no hesitation to give any Malfoy Family objects to his rivals if it would help in his son being found. In fact, he actually trusted Albus greatly, as he allowed him to connect with Scorpius when he couldn't after Astoria died, and genuinely care for the boy for what he meant to his son. Draco even went as far as to protest to Harry for having made Albus distant from Scorpius, showing how much he valued the friendship between Albus and Scorpius. Draco was more strict with Scorpius than his parents were to him, accepting that his son must be punished for having brought the wizarding world back to the times where Voldemort was in power. His personal relationships with his old school rivals has also changed from antagonistic to being civil and tolerating. While he continued to mock Harry's friends for them only being so popular because of Harry and didn't trust them fully with matters regarding his son, as he gave a cold reply letter to Ginny's offer to having Scorpius stay in the Potter House, particularly being enraged at them for the rumours that Scorpius was Voldemort's son, he was more than willing to team up with Harry, Ron and Hermione to save both Albus and Scorpius and worked with them effectively to dispatch Delphini, despite her being the daughter of Voldemort and his aunt Bellatrix. This defiance of Delphini showed that even having the Dark Lord's daughter being a blood relative was a repugnant notion to Draco, wanting little to do with his Death Eater past, further shown by how he would attend and help his rivals in defeating what remained of the forces of darkness. By this time, Draco also began referring to Voldemort by his name rather than the 'Dark Lord' as he did in his youth due to his self-redemption. Draco had came to trust the luck and instincts of both Harry and Hermione, taking the orders of the Minister For Magic without hesitation, even expressing he was impressed with her battle commands, albeit in a mildly amused manner, acknowledging Harry was always ready to solve the thickest of situations, and he even went as far as to confess to Harry that he never truly craved power like his father and that his ambition was actually to become a star Quidditch player, but he wasn't good enough, and mainly he just wanted to be happy along with the truth of Astoria's death, and his envy of Harry's friendships, as he only ever had Crabbe and Goyle, outright acknowledging Harry as a friend and showing respect for him, which was mutually returned by Harry. Readily relied on logic, which often helped her to cleverly deduce information that many others missed. However, her emphasis on logic made her skeptical about accepting anything without proof. Her logic had limits, putting her beliefs before all else at the same time in a way that made her ignore reality when it contradicted what she believed, no matter how strong or overwhelming the evidence was. Her immense workload finally seemed to be getting to her. Every night, without fail, Hermione was to be seen in a corner of the common room, several tables spread with books, she barely spoke to anybody and snapped when she was interrupted. In spite of her strait-laced disposition, she wasn't above using coercion and threats to get what she wanted, achieve results or protect herself and those she cared about in the long run. Ferocity, proud of her heritage. Because of her opinionated, interfering nature, she had the reputation for being a bossy know-it-all. Her sometimes abrasive attitude masked deep insecurities and fear of failure. She felt the need to prove herself, perhaps partly because of how many people looked down on her. However, she didn't let anyone bully her and ignored bigots. Despite her growing confidence in her abilities, she wasn't arrogant or conceited, and helped her classmates with their schoolwork whenever she could. She initially showed a tendency toward mild panic in sudden situations, in time she was able to overcome this trait of hers, and demonstrated her bravery and extreme loyalty to her friends many times when facing danger, risking her life frequently to help them and standing by them even when no one else did. Love and compassion towards others, managed to be persuaded, peaceful personality, heartbroken, free love. Argumentative, formidable fury, not very short-tempered.

Cavalier and harshly authoritarian attitude, describes baking/chemistry as an art and an exact science, favoritism. Snape knew full well why Dumbledore never granted him the position, as it may be a trigger to bring out his worst side, something he denied to Umbridge's questioning but let in to those of Bellatrix's. When he finally got his wish, Snape taught the course with a loving caress in his voice, far beyond simply respecting the Dark Arts as a dangerous foe, something he did not show in his post as the Potions Master. He also taught this class slightly fairer than he did in Potions, such as lowering his entrance standards and biases for N.E.W.T. level classes, allowing more students to enter the advanced studies of his favourite class, and placed students from his own house, such as Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, in detention for failing to do acceptable work the second time around after failing their O.W.L. the previous year. Snape showing Dumbledore his true and undying love for Lily Potter Ultimately, it was Snape's past and his love for Lily Evans that defined his inner being. His love for Lily Evans became most noticeable by his Patronus; a Doe, just like Lily's. Upon overhearing the Prophecy, he immediately informed his then-master of its contents, unaware that this would endanger Lily and her family. It was only after Lily's death that Snape realised the full extent of his actions. He suffered terrible remorse for what he had done and spent the rest of his life in constant danger in order to protect Lily's son. \"You are a braver man by far than Igor Karkaroff. You know, I sometimes think we Sort too soon...\" \u2014 Snape's bravery despite the dangers to his own life[src] In spite of his vindictive demeanour, Severus Snape was an immensely brave man who possessed a deep capacity for love. Everything that he did in the latter part of his life was motivated by his devotion to Lily Evans, whom he loved unconditionally. He was one of Dumbledore's most reliable allies and, in his role as a double agent, took great personal risk in ensuring Harry's safety from Lord Voldemort. Despite his years of him and Harry barely getting along, if at all, Snape openly criticised Dumbledore after learning he protected Harry all these years just so he could die at the right time due to being a Horcrux, showing he didn't agree with Harry's death even though, at first, he only protected him because of his relationship to Lily. When he informed Dumbledore that he informed Voldemort of the prophecy, Snape begged Dumbledore to hide Harry, Lily, and even James too. This clearly showed that Snape prioritised Lily's happiness above all else, even if it meant her being with a man he hated for most of his life. Despite his coldness towards all but Lily, Snape nevertheless proved capable of genuinely caring for others apart from Lily and Harry. He showed that despite his mistreatment of them, he cared considerably for the students of Hogwarts, risking his fa\u00e7ade for them by secretly doing everything he can to make sure they stayed out of harm's way and at one point being genuinely concerned when a student was taken to the Chamber of Secrets. Additionally, Snape was also genuinely saddened by the death of Rowan Khanna, his face just as mournful as the rest of the other House Heads, and if Rowan were in Slytherin, Snape even went as far as to plead with Merula to stop being angry and comfort them with the prospect of standing together in the face of crisis. Snape's temper and brand of discipline toward Gryffindors While he initially resented Dumbledore for his lack of intervention on his torturous bullying by the Marauders, it seemed the time he spent allying with Dumbledore had made him grow to genuinely as well as greatly respect and even care for him, as shown by how he was clearly shocked into being silent for a long time after Dumbledore asked Snape to kill him, clearly indicated that killing Dumbledore was hard for him to do and tried to make him have Draco kill him instead of having Snape do it. Even after learning of how Dumbledore had wanted Harry to die so Voldemort can be defeated, when preparing to kill Dumbledore, his face was described as being genuinely hateful and disgusted of what he was about to do. The Direnni left a significant mark on the Bretons. The race's obsession with nobility, status, and lineage can be traced back to their days as vassals of Clan Direnni. Bretons possess an inborn and instinctive bond for the magical arts, often attributed to their elven blood. They are known for their intelligence and have a quick and perceptive grasp of spellcraft, enchantment, and alchemy. However, It is often difficult for an individual Breton to leave a lasting impression on the greater magical community; the very same mystical aptitude that produces such widespread natural talent also makes it much harder for Breton mages to stand out. Their human lifespans put them at a disadvantage relative to their elven peers, whose naturally long lives allow them more time to study, hone their skills, and make a name for themselves. Despite this, several Bretons have managed to cement themselves among the most well-regarded mages in history, with notable figures such as Voernet, Druid King Kasorayn, and Gyron Vardengroet. Despite the inherent Altmeri weakness to magical attacks, this trait did not carry over to the Bretons. Even the humblest of Bretons can boast a high resistance to destructive and dominating magical energies. Ben Solo was a human male who stood at 1.89 meters and weighed 89 kilograms. He had dark brown hair, light skin, and brown eyes that appeared ancient to his father when Solo was a child. There was a strong family resemblance between Solo and his parents; he had his father's long face and posture, as well as his pronounced nose and lopsided smile. He also had his mother's piercing brown eyes, a feature Organa was sure was inherited from her own birth mother Padm\u00e9 Amidala. He also had the same warm eyes as his mother. He also mirrored his parents in personality, whether as Kylo Ren or Ben Solo. He was very much like his mother, as observed by General Armitage Hux, who believed that Ren would have denied the comparison. He also had his father's sarcastic sense of humor, which sometimes emerged in serious or violent situations. However, Solo was also similar to his grandfather, to the dismay of his parents who saw \"too much of Vader\" within their son. Like all races, Redguards have been shaped by their home. Since their arrival, they have been few in number, relative to the other races of Tamriel. Their Yokudan heritage left them with advanced seafaring, agricultural, military and even astronomical knowledge that allowed them to thrive in a place where others merely hoped to survive. Redguard society is extremely martial, and nearly everyone is expected to have a grasp of basic weaponry and combat, although only the rulers are generally expected to have detailed knowledge of strategy, formations and tactics. Only the strongest, fastest and smartest Redguards are accepted into the demanding military (which consists mainly of various knightly orders; Redguards don't traditionally have a standing army), and they are expected to prove themselves worthy by facing death. Even their entertainment, like snake charming, bears some risk to it. The practice of magic has generally been frowned upon dating back to the First Era, and outsiders are not tolerated in many parts of Hammerfell. Many believe that no \"true\" Redguard would stoop to using magic, considering it a weakness. Certain schools that teach the Way of the Sword forbid students to use magic and enchanted weapons. By the Third Era, spellcasters were shunned in Hammerfell, believing them to be wicked individuals who steal souls and tamper with minds. Necromancy has always been abhorred in Redguard culture, due to their reverence of the dead. Although being suspicious of magic is regarded as a hallmark of Redguard culture, it was not always so pronounced. In ancient times, Yokudan war-wizards were part of their armies, albeit rare. Sword-singers were said to have forged swords woven with magic and indeed the Shehai itself is believed to be a form of magic. They have a great affinity for horses. Redguards have a great diversity in styles for their clothing, though it always tends to be light, long, and flowing to best tolerate the heat and hazards of the desert. They first developed this style of dress in Yokuda, which was known to have arid deserts similar to the Alik'r desert of their adopted homeland. The flowing curves of Redguard dress is mimicked in the designs of their armor and weaponry. Imperial propaganda from the late Second Era speaks of some Redguards opting to go nude in public, particularly in Rihad. The stone-worshipping people of the Hammerfell wear porcelain armor, enchanted and blessed by the Gods through the hands of its craftsman, each scale painted by hand with ocean patterns. Denizens of the Alik'r tend to favor lightweight leather armors to better cope with heat, and often wear face coverings to keep sand from their mouths. In their constant quest for water, they often employ johads, simple but effective water collectors made of sticks and fabric which gather the morning dew of the desert. They are a highly disciplined and enterprising people, having centuries of experience with warfare in their homeland before arriving on Tamriel's shores. Their warriors are acknowledged to be among the best in the world. The Redguards are also known for their naval prowess, and their fleets have proved a match for the Empire's best armadas, as seen during the Stros M'Kai revolt. Stros M'Kai and some parts of mainland Hammerfell hold many Dwemer ruins, and some young Redguards seeking to enter military service must brave the dangers of these ruins. Most of their holidays and traditions seem to revolve around either the celebration of natural phenomena or the commemoration of great battles and warriors. Stuffed lizards are common gifts for children, tall, gaunt frames and finely toned physiques, above average human strength and agility, remarkable capacity for surviving in hot, dry climates, hair ranging from wavy to very curly. Tattoos and body piercings are common. Redguard buildings vary from simple tents to the sturdy domed structures of the cities which incorporate many Yokudan advancements. The latter are renowned for their rigidity, flexibility, heat transference, and general ornate beauty. They are much easier to repair than most Imperial stonemasonry. While much Imperial construction requires demolition and rebuilding after conflict, many of the Yokudan accent pieces, such as the flying staircases or ornamental domes, are designed to crumble after an attack or an earthquake, which allows them to be easily replaced in sections afterward. However, these structures are still solidly built; they stand tall and firm against the harsh environment of Hammerfell. They are characterized by thickly-built walls to help insulate against the heat of the desert, as well as a carefully-planned system of ventilation ducts. These ducts are built alongside windows high on the walls, and are covered by horizontal slats which keep out the sun while permitting the wind to enter. Each building is designed to channel even the slightest breeze from these ducts down to the floor. At the time the Crystal Tower was built in the Merethic Era, the Elves of Summerset had a relatively egalitarian society, though social stratification slowly developed into a rigid hierarchy of classes over the millennia. The Wise (teachers and priests) became the highest echelon, followed by Artists, Princes, Warriors, Landowners, Merchants, Workers, and enslaved beasts such as Goblins. Early literature by man painted the High Elves in poor light, though the impartiality of these accounts is questionable. It was suggested that the Altmer practiced eugenic infanticide, putting to death nine in ten of their newborns due to impurities, that Altmeri names are simply combinations of numbers in their own language, and that Altmer culture revolves around displaying social status. Some of this has basis in fact; Altmer born with deformities or impurities are often - though not always - abandoned by their parents as \"hulkynd\" (sometimes to be raised by priests of Stendarr), and the full name of an Altmer is relatively extensive, detailing their patrilineal and matrilineal histories in addition to the history of their clan. Religion and Philosophy[edit][ ] The creation myth of the Altmer begins before the start of the Dawn Era and the beginning of time: the primordial force of Anu, stasis or order, created Anuiel, the soul of all things, so it could know itself. Anuiel in turn created Sithis for the same purpose, who was the force of change and chaos and the sum up of all limitations, and their interrelation created the Aurbis, where the Original Spirits, the Aedra and Daedra, emerged before the creation of the Mundus. The ancient Aldmer believed they are the relatively feeble descendants of the Aedra (\"Aedra\" roughly translates to \"ancestor spirit\"), aspects of those Aedra who populated the Mundus so that it might last despite Lorkhan's deception. As their hierarchical society developed, the lower classes stopped worshipping their own \"lesser\" Aedra in favor of those claimed by their social \"betters\". Thus the Altmer pantheon slowly formed around the most popular and well-known of the Aedra, many of whom would later be incorporated into the Nine Divines. The transition and choices have not gone without detractors. The principal Eight are Auri-El, Magnus, Trinimac, Y'ffre (or Jephre), Xarxes, Mara, Stendarr, and Syrabane - though any limitation to eight is unrecognized by Altmer outside the Empire - with significant additional cults dedicated to Phynaster and Lorkhan. An Altmeri depiction of Summerset watched over (from left to right) by Xarxes, Auri-El, Mara, and Y'ffre/Jephre, capped by the Crystal Tower In this developed form, Altmer religion venerates Auri-El as the soul of Anuiel. Auri-El allowed Lorkhan's creation of the mortal world in a moment of weakness, an enormity that severed the Aldmer from their eternal spirit world. Realizing his folly, he led their armies to defeat the Trickster God and establish the first Altmer kingdoms, Altmora and Old Ehlnofey, before ascending into heaven. The Altmer aspire to follow him and join their Aedric ancestors among the stars. Xarxes is believed to have been a scribe or priest of Auri-El who attained godhood, and originated and preserves the intricate structure of Altmer society. He is said to keep records of the lives of every Altmer and of all the bonds of lineage that connect them, and his scribe-priests are professed to preserve the knowledge of an ancient and otherwise forgotten language. The priests of Auri-El teach that the Hand of Auri-El, the Eye of Magnus, the Arm of Trinimac, the Bones of Y'ffre, the Mouth of Xarxes, and the Heart of Mara form a single \"divine body\" which must be venerated as one, and with which the Altmer themselves are one. Stendarr's role in Altmeri myth is that of an apologist for Men. Views on Stendarr are sharply divided: some Altmer reject his worship owing to this connection, while others venerate him for undertaking the \"heavy burden\" with compassion and mercy. The popular hymn Praise Be includes a verse of praise for Stendarr, which is absent from the circulated written edition. The roots of the Altmer superstition holding that the number two is inauspicious likely also lie in the belief that it is the \"number of Man\". In the Fourth Era, the Thalmor have made it their objective to eradicate the cult of the Man-turned-god Talos throughout Tamriel. A priestly hierarchy oversees Altmer worship of the Aedra. Some priests are monastics, devoting themselves to peace and meditation in monasteries led by Aldarchs. Others serve at public temples, where they instruct acolytes. Ascendant Curates are responsible for the refinement, conferral and destruction of calians, and preside over the expulsion and admission of particular mer from and into Altmer society. Though Daedric cults also exist among the Altmer, whose ambition and magical prowess sometimes tempt them to seek the powers of Oblivion, Daedra worship is severely reprobated in civil society. Moreover, at least at the time of the Three Banners War, the authorities in Summerset viewed the living gods of the Dunmer Tribunal Temple as enemies of the state. expected to honor their ancestors by honoring their own lives. He put an emphasis on the importance of the Divine Spark and and urged Altmer to keep records of their lives as a sacred duty in form of an Oghma, an everscriven scroll which should memorialize their lives. Praxis[edit][ ] At an Altmer's coming of age, they are granted a calian, a sphere of aetherquartz crystal representing their honor and social status. The aetherquartz in calian spheres is polished using ground pumice and ocean sand. Calians are considered to be \"praxic talismans\". Mer who have committed some particularly grievous crime against Altmer law are termed \"ousters\" and \"apraxics\". While ousters are simply banished from their homes, apraxics are treated more severely: their calians are ceremonially shattered by a curate and it is wholly forbidden for Altmer in good standing to speak to them.. Some apraxics labor for years to restore their status, as part of which they must painstakingly repair their own calian, while others choose to remain in exile. Nonetheless, in the middle of the Second Era subversive literature written by aprax mer gained wide currency among young Altmer on Summerset Isle, and provoked some of them to engage in revolutionary activity. This questioning of Altmer customs coincided with reforms introduced by Queen Ayrenn after the founding of the First Aldmeri Dominion, including the end of Summerset's longstanding isolation and the opening of its borders to other races and cultures, which provoked heated debate and political maneuvering. Alaxon[edit][ ] One of the dominant philosophies of the Altmer of Summerset is the \"Path to Alaxon\", the continuous striving for a state of perfection. Practice of the Path requires intense dedication and concentrated effort. Those who are judged to have attained a degree of perfection are granted an an alaxon sphere, which, like calians, may be destroyed if they are judged to have fallen from it. The Path to Alaxon is reflected in Summerset's characteristic architecture, which builds on the aesthetic practice of past architects in a sequential process of refinement. Altmer society was highly stratified by the middle of the Second Era. The monarch of Summerset ruled as sovereign with the advice of the College of Sapiarchs, an elite and highly selective scholarly institute, and was sometimes represented by a viceroy titled the Proxy Queen or King. The monarch descended from an almost continuous line of royalty extending back to the Merethic Era. Their behavior was regulated by a set of written precedents known as the Scrolls of Praxis, whose chief interpreters were the Sapiarchs: these formed part of a broader system of inherited norms termed the Ceremoniarchy. The heir to the throne was required to study the Ceremoniarchy for 3,555 days in the Sapiarchs' Labyrinth before they could take the crown, and royal decrees were issued in its name. Hereditary nobles termed kinlords and kinladies held many of the Altmer lands in fief. Altmer royalty were assisted by lieutenants titled vicereeves, while cities that served as county seats were administered by canonreeves, civil officials equivalent to mayors in other cultures. The Divine Prosecution administers secular and religious justice, and is made up of jurisreeves overseeing investigations and rank-and-file justiciars. Jurisreeves travel and deliberate in groups of three, each with distinct responsibilities: a revelator-naganwe to conduct magical inquiries, an admanen to serve as an inspector, and a thalmilan who would weigh the evidence and render a verdict. The jurisreeves may have originated as a religious order. Under Queen Ayrenn's First Aldmeri Dominion, executive responsibilities were increasingly assumed by the Thalmor, originally a bureau for the protection of Altmeri heritage. The Thalmor incorporated the Divine Prosecution as a division at that time, but the Prosecution existed long before the Thalmor's rise to power. politics, diplomacy and espionage. A Fourth Era Thalmor justiciar As mentioned, whenever a substantial minority had some sort of socio-political or theological disagreement with the majority in Summerset in the Dawn Era, the dissidents would leave and usually go on to become other races of Mer. However, some time in the Merethic Era, one early group of dissidents who opposed the evolution to the traditional Altmer pantheon left the mainland of Summerset but remained quintessentially Altmer. The Psijics decided to follow the mystical Old Ways of Aldmeris and broke away to settle Artaeum, the third-largest island of the Isle. Though they have often refused requests for dialogue from Alinor during their periods of seclusion from Tamriel, the Psijics are not hostile to the other Altmer, and have offered their magic to protect Summerset in the past. A leader of the Psijics, Ritemaster Iachesis, led them through the entire First Era and most of the Second, a span of some 3,500 years, giving some indication of the potential longevity of the Altmer. A subsequent bout of dissent occurred late in the Third Era, as younger Altmer again began pushing for social reform. These episodes were unusual in a society used to dissidents simply leaving. But there were few if any places left to go at that point. Some change had taken place by the end of the Third Era: the Altmer once more allowed foreigners to come to their shores; some non-Altmer were even allowed to rise to the ranks of nobility in Summerset. Many of these young rebellious Altmer turned to the Psijics for guidance, somewhat ironically consulting their distant past for a path to their future, while some militant radicals turned to terrorism. These tentative reforms were substantially reversed at the turn of the Fourth Era by the rise of the Thalmor, who instituted a policy of persecution and even open slaughter of dissidents and non-Elven races. Numerous surviving Altmer dissidents were forced to flee to other parts of Tamriel, where they were frequently targeted by Thalmor assassins. While many Altmer continue to disagree with the Thalmor in private, few venture to oppose them publicly. raging, psychopathic. harsh upbringing and brutal training, nobility and heroic attitude. desperate to believe in something, stable and sociable person. well-adjusted and happy, with an easy going attitude and a sarcastic wit. heroic figure. - Superhuman strength: Connor possessed strength far superior to that of an average human. He had been bested in battle by both Faith and Angel, but he was still stronger than most vampires and many kinds of demons, even those from Quor'toth. An example of his strength was when he was able to land a hit on Marcus Hamilton that momentarily stunned him, albeit after he caught him off-guard when Hamilton was shown to be very hard to injure in any way. However, Connor was no match for him when he was expecting his attacks even with his strength. Furthermore, he shattered Jasmine's head with a single punch whereas Angel was unable to cause her any long-term damage, though it is likely that his connection to Jasmine enabled him to do so. Connor killed a powerful demon by effortlessly ripping its heart out of its stomach. Shortly after he returned from Quor'toth, he managed to easily lift a snack machine and smash it to the ground with great force, breaking it.[citation needed] - Superhuman speed: Like all vampires, Connor possessed superhuman speed and reflexes. He saved Fred from a thrown axe by showing up out of nowhere and catching it. He also surprised Cordelia by handing her a towel despite sitting by a window still several meters away a few seconds before. - notably resistant to blunt force trauma, could jump great heights and distances. possessed acute senses, can track people by scent, and was able to hear whispering from a distance of several meters. - Skilled combatant: In addition to his innate powers, Connor was trained by his foster father, Daniel Holtz, in hunting and in both unarmed and armed combat. However, unlike the technical skills displayed by the Slayers and Angel, Connor generally relied more on a brute force approach, his usual combat strategy based around hitting his opponents fast and beating them into submission, leaving him at a disadvantage when faced with more sophisticated combatants. Although he once defeated Angel in a fight, it should be noted that he was using a taser at the time, and also had the advantage that Angel wasn't expecting him to attack, and didn't want to hurt him back. During a later fight, Connor was defeated by Angel even when his father had lost his memories and thought he was a teenager, and was fighting on instinct. Connor's subsequent victory over Sahjhan was only aided by the fact that he took Sahjhan by surprise with the sudden return of his original memories. With his memories restored, Connor also proved a match for the demon Sahjhan, someone Angel was no match for. However, this was mostly while he was armed with an ax with which he landed most of the blows that hurt while his own punches seemed to have little effect on the demon.[citation needed] - competent leader. stables have been recognized for their lavishness and the ingenious design which makes them perfect for the environmental hazards. Their enormous mausoleums. The Far Shores, also called the Far Dunes, is the afterlife sought by the Redguards. According to Yokudan myth, Satakal, the serpentine God of Everything, eats itself over and over, periodically consuming all of creation. By \"moving at strange angles\" to stride between \"worldskins\", a process known as the Walkabout, the strongest of the spirits learned to bypass this cycle of destruction. Thanks to Ruptga's guidance, many weaker spirits were able to find their way as well, and the practice became so easy that it became a place\u2014the Far Shores. Here, the spirits can safely wait until Satakal has passed and a new skin has emerged. There is no hunger or thirst in the Far Shores, but there are ample martial challenges to keep Redguard warrior-spirits engaged for eternity. impish yet charming, charismatic yet disarming, manly and heroic yet innocent and bubbly, had a positive attitude and was often misunderstood because she found it hard to express herself.

She scoffed at religion and had little opinion of herself as a human saying her soul was beyond saving, had little attachment to who she was before, even forgetting her birth name, cruel, manipulative and seductive.

For instance, when she was still human, she was able to sense Angelus' and Darla's presences at a distance, and perceive their nefarious intentions for her, which led her to herd her family away. Just before siring Spike, she sensed the passionate killer that lurked beneath his timid exterior. Drusilla could also sense Angel's presence out from a crowd of demons, and realized Giles' love for Jenny by merely touching his head. The most potent application of this power was allowing Drusilla to sense past and future emotions \u2014 she sensed Spike's subconscious love for Buffy, as well as the fear of those who took refuge in Holland Manners' wine cellar when it was a nuclear fallout shelter during wartime. - had the power to gain insight into a question or situation using cards, used a set of Tarot cards, \"was always straightforward.

One of Drusilla's most prominent traits was her ability to foresee the future. Although her insanity makes her visions somewhat difficult to understand for both herself and others, her abilities have often served as foreshadowing to future events. Before she followed William Pratt into the alley where she turned him, she commented to Darla and Angelus that she would \"pick the wisest and bravest knight in all the land\" for her future \"playmate.\" Although Spike first became one of the most notorious and violent vampires in history, after falling in love with Buffy Summers and sacrificing his life, he truly did become the \"brave knight\" she had imagined. torture and death, particularly vicious. she displays behavior that suggests she was somewhat infantile.

He was deadly in both armed and unarmed combat, Possessing an inquisitive mind, Solo endeavored to gain greater knowledge of the Force and the Jedi ways during his apprenticeship under Skywalker. Solo was particularly interested in ancient Jedi weapons; on one occasion, he marveled at a lightsaber rifle. He practiced the art of fancy handwriting or \"calligraphy,\" an art that had fallen into disuse as almost no one wrote by hand during the era of the New Republic. He recorded his handwritten insights into the Jedi on parchment scrolls which he kept next to his calligraphy set. His interests included dark aspects of the Force not taught by Skywalker. After Solo became Kylo Ren, he studied both Jedi and arcane dark side lore, using these contradictory teachings for greater power. When Skywalker's attention was divided by teaching multiple students, Solo turned to the dark voice he knew as Snoke. Solo struggled with the expectations of his family legacy; he was descended from some of the most powerful Jedi and Sith in galactic history. Supreme Leader Snoke considered Ren a focal point between the dark side and the light, a balance that made him a target of Snoke so Ren's powers could be used to further the ambitions of the First Order. His fall to the dark side suppressed the boy who had once been named Ben Solo. Solo burned and destroyed the Jedi temple while furious that his uncle had apparently tried to kill him. He was immediately horrified and tried in vain to help his fellow students. He surveyed the fiery ruins and the bodies scattered around him in a state of shock, expressing how he never wanted this outcome. He warned his peers who survived the temple's destruction that he did not want to fight them, and fled to join Snoke and the Knights of Ren. His turn to the dark side was marked by killing the Knights' leader and murdering Voe, a fellow Padawan. When Solo turned away from the Jedi path, he no longer felt obliged to hold back his power. He embraced his conviction that he was more powerful than any of Skywalker's other apprentices, individually or collectively, and even Skywalker himself. As far as he was concerned, the notion that the others were his equal was a lie. Solo hated his full name; he felt as though everyone wanted him to be like his namesake he had never met, Obi-Wan \"Ben\" Kenobi, and that inheriting his father's invented surname represented how everything was a lie. Snoke told Solo to become his true self by adopting a new name, and encouraged him to take the name that Solo had invented as a child. reveled in the fury of battle and killing her enemies. In addition to his temperament, Ren was known for his lack of patience, especially for those who failed him. While Ren was not born into the First Order, he was convinced that they were on the right side of history. Ren fought alongside his stormtroopers on the front lines of the battlefield. Although he would ignore the counsel of his advisors, favoring brute force over negotiation, he earned fear and respect through his ferocity as a warrior. honed her fighting skills on the battlefield. embodied conflict, having learned the arts of the Force through Jedi and Sith teachings. He sought to bury his past as Ben Solo, yet channeled painful experiences and emotions from his youth to further his own power. He hoped to become immune to the light and avoid Darth Vader's sentimentality so he could succeed where Vader had failed. Despite Ren's willingness to extinguish the light within himself by any means necessary, his attempt to break his connection with the past and surrender entirely to the dark side by killing his father not only failed, but also marked him physically and psychologically. Murdering his father imbalanced his mind and led to his defeat by Rey, who marked his face with a scar that became a reminder of his failure. Snoke, having observed that Ren remained at war with himself, derided Han's murder as an act of petulance instead of strength. Ren accepted the idea that he was a monster with cold reservation and believed the dark side was in his nature. His failed attempts to contact his grandfather through the Force caused him to believe that hope, which he equated to a false prophet, only led to severe disappointment. Ren did not believe in the existence of an afterlife until his mother and Rey saved him from certain death, causing him to reconsider his outlook on life and death. Ren's desperation to prove himself as a worthy apprentice was ultimately replaced by the desire to free himself from his Master, having spent much of his life as a student of Skywalker and Snoke in turn. He soon grew resentful of his status as Snoke's apprentice, believing he would always be kept subservient as long as his Master was alive. Ren felt liberated by Snoke's death because it granted him the power and independence he had long coveted. He had no intention of ever serving another master and was, therefore, fiercely protective of his new rank. Like Vader before him, Ren believed it was his destiny to rule over the weaker beings of the galaxy. He dreamed of conquering the galaxy with Rey at his side. If Ren had chosen his own title, it would have been \"Master of the Dark Side\" or \"Commander of the Knights of Ren\" rather than \"Supreme Leader;\" however, he considered the title right and just for himself as the head of the First Order. Embracing an authoritarian style of leadership, he believed that all people and their worlds must bend to his will. He was determined to show the First Order's true power to the galaxy and expected it to be met with gratitude. Ren enjoyed the simplicity of fascism. Wielding absolute power reminded him of his grandfather, Ren, like Vader, was a leader who expected total obedience from his followers and punished those who failed him. Relic hunter Mika Grey once taunted Agent Raith with such knowledge, remarking that Ren would surely punish the First Order Raider if he returned without any artifacts to show for himself. Ren had little tolerance for those who defied him to his face, especially after he became the Supreme Leader. Defiance against the First Order, which he considered the greatest regime in the galaxy, perplexed him. Ren did not understand why a person would reject a life of security under his rule, risking one's life just to show their contempt for the First Order. However, he was interested in understanding the views of those who opposed him, though he considered them \"radicals\" for doing so. Regardless of their reasons, he still intended to punish an entire world and its population if they resisted his authority. Ultimately, Ren believed that resistance was futile, and that it was his right to lead the galaxy as the Supreme Leader of the First Order. Ren was also distrustful of others; having isolated himself from his family and friends, the only people in Ren's life were subordinates and a master that he hated. Gaining the title of Supreme Leader only made Ren more suspicious of the individuals around him, particularly Hux, but also Pryde and Darth Sidious. After the duel with Rey on Kef Bir, Ren questioned his beliefs and regretted the choices he made. His parents' love for him and Rey's compassion brought him back to the light, destroying the persona of Kylo Ren. Although he still carried feelings of guilt and self-doubt within him, he later recognized them as remnants of Snoke's conditioning that led Solo to become Kylo Ren. Having reconciled with his father in spirit, Solo hoped that one day he would come to forgive himself. Solo's personality and his former persona as Ren were different in several ways, as observed by both himself and Rey. Unlike Ren, Solo neither derived pleasure from killing nor reveled in the fury of battle. He was relieved that the weapon he used to kill his father would never kill again after he discarded it. He confronted his enemies with a Jedi's focus instead of enjoyment or anger. Unlike Ren, who had shown mercy to no one, Solo avoided prolonging his opponent's suffering by giving them the mercy of a quick death. Although he no longer counted himself among the ranks of the Knights of Ren, he still regarded them as his brothers-in-arms until their reunion on Exegol. Sensing their hatred for him, Solo knew that they would no longer obey his orders as their true allegiance belonged to Darth Sidious. He felt betrayed, but resolved to fight them out of determination to help Rey. Mirroring Darth Vader's death as Anakin Skywalker, Solo sacrificed his life out of love and died following this redemptive act. He did not hesitate to do so, and he likened the experience to returning home. Son of heroes[ ] - \"It's too late. She's gone.\" \"Your mother's gone. But what she stood for, what she fought for, that's not gone.\" - Ben Solo and Han Solo (memory) Ben Solo meant everything to his parents, Han Solo and Leia Organa, and he was happy in his childhood. He grew to believe that his parents thought he was disturbed, having overheard their conversations about him and his lack of control over his innate Force abilities. His parents' busy professional lives and their decision to send him to be trained by his uncle left him feeling abandoned. He did not realize at the time that his fears about his family were influenced by Darth Sidious. Despite his feelings of neglect and abandonment, Ren did not hate his parents. During his trial on Dagobah, he could not bring himself to attack the vision of his parents, even as Snoke urged him to kill the source of his conflict. Although he was adamant that Han Solo meant nothing to him, Ren struggled with uncertainty when his father confronted him. His decision to kill Han was motivated by his desperation to escape his past by freeing himself from his attachments. However, his connection to the dark side did not grow stronger after committing patricide. Instead, the act of killing his own father caused Ren to feel weaker, affecting his very spirit and leaving him feeling more lost than ever. When faced with the chance to kill his mother, Ren was surprised to sense her concern for him, having anticipated anger at the death of her husband. In the end, Ren could not bring himself to fire on her. As Leia Organa died, she reached out through the Force to send her hope and love to her son, calling him back to the light. Listening to the voice of his father and seeing pride and joy in Han's eyes ultimately caused the last vestiges of the persona of Kylo Ren to fade from the mind of Ben Solo. Nephew of a legend[ ] - \"At least he could have let me fly the ship. Would give me something to do. He's a great teacher, very strong. I've learned so much from him... But he never seems to want me to use any of it.\" - Ben Solo, on his apprenticeship under Luke Skywalker Ben Solo regarded his uncle and mentor, Luke Skywalker, with great esteem. Though he had misgivings about Skywalker's teaching methods, Solo saw his uncle as an amazing teacher and a legendary Jedi Master. He recognized his master's strength and knowledge with the Force, and learned much under Skywalker's tutelage. Despite the boredom that Solo tried to cope with on some of their missions together, he shared his uncle's enthusiasm for discovering ancient Jedi relics. In private, he lamented how Skywalker hoarded such treasures by storing them away in his temple, never to be used. As a Skywalker and a Jedi-in-training, Solo felt as though he was being judged against his legendary uncle and, by extension, the Jedi Masters who trained him. While such comparisons motivated Solo to excel at his Jedi training, they also contributed to his insecurities. His ambition was to become more powerful and accomplished than the generations of Jedi who preceded him, including the \"old guard\" of Jedi Masters like Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda whose legacies influenced the Skywalker family for two generations. Having never known the Jedi who died before his birth, Solo likened his competition with deceased Jedi Masters to playing a game of sabaac with \"ghosts.\" Though jealous of his predecessors, Solo grew to respect the skills of the most legendary Jedi who were revered by his uncle. In contrast to his views of the old Jedi, Solo did not consider his fellow students as rivals. Seeing his uncle standing over him with an ignited lightsaber had a profound impact on Solo's psyche. Solo saw this as a betrayal that confirmed his worst fears about his family. Overcome with anger and confusion, he believed his uncle would have murdered him in his sleep. The experience also left him disillusioned with the Jedi way, which Solo now viewed as a lie that his life had been wasted on. In contrast to the enduring sentiment that he harbored for his mother and father, Kylo Ren never forgave Skywalker for what he believed was an intention to kill him in his sleep. Snoke tasked Ren with destroying any remnants of the Jedi, including his own uncle, whose attempt to restore the Jedi Order was thwarted when Ren betrayed him and the other Jedi students. Ren struck down a vision of Skywalker on Dagobah without hesitation or regret. When confronted by his uncle on Crait, Ren's hatred intensified, and he overlooked inconsistencies in Skywalker's illusionary appearance while the Resistance fled. Ben Solo was drawn towards the dark side by Snoke beginning in his childhood. Through telepathic contact, Snoke acted as a confidant while sowing doubt. After destroying the Jedi temple, Solo sought out Snoke, whom he regarded as the only friend he had left. Snoke, in turn, used the situation to further discredit Skywalker in Solo's eyes, convincing the boy that his youth had been wasted learning the ways of the Jedi. Encouraged by Snoke, Solo sought the Knights of Ren, and became their leader when he killed their master and turned to the dark side. inner conflict grew as his Master encouraged him to use the heritage of both the light and the dark, honing Ren into a weapon of the First Order and the archetype of a new kind of dark side user that filled the void left behind when the Sith were destroyed during the Battle of Endor. After his defeat at Starkiller Base, Ren was furious and resentful when his Master derided him as a failed apprentice and \"a child in a mask.\" Snoke regarded Ren's imbalance after killing his father as proof that Ren was too weak and sentimental to be worthy of his grandfather's legacy. Ren's pain caused him to explore the connection he and Rey shared and question his loyalty to Snoke. In addition, his father's warning that the Supreme Leader was only using him for his power echoed in his mind. Ren was plotting his future through uncertain times and, with dark side-fueled ambition, prioritized his survival and ultimate ascension. At first, Ren continued to think of Snoke as his esteemed mentor for guiding him on the path to the power of the dark side. However, the revelation of Darth Sidious' revival alarmed Ren as it fueled his suspicion that the Master he respected had been subservient to a greater power. Learning the truth about Snoke's origins shattered the respect that Ren held for the former Supreme Leader, but it also reinforced Ren's belief that he had made the right decision to seize power from his predecessor. Whereas Ren once regarded Snoke as the wise leader of the First Order, he now saw his old Master as nothing more than an expendable \"vat-grown organism.\" Heir of Darth Vader[ ] - \"Young Ben Solo possessed what all masters live to see: raw, untamed power. But a great conflict raged within the boy as well. Not only did his inner turmoil make him heir apparent to his grandfather, Lord Vader, it also made him the perfect pawn.\" - Darth Sidious Like his grandfather, Anakin Skywalker, Ben Solo felt the need to prove himself because of the great power that he was born with. As Kylo Ren he saw himself carrying on the tradition embodied by Darth Vader, the dark side version of his grandfather and Ren's personal hero. However, Ren's understanding of Skywalker's history was twisted by Snoke. Ren, like Snoke, attributed the Galactic Empire's downfall not to ineffective strategy but to Vader's sentimentality for his son, Luke Skywalker. Ren considered it a foolish error in judgment and a momentary lapse in an otherwise great life. He believed that if Vader had not succumbed to the light, the Empire would have prevailed. Ren idolized his grandfather\u2014the darkness that was Vader, not the light of Skywalker. He would have given anything to meet Vader in person, but rejected the memory of Skywalker and believed that version of his grandfather to be nothing more than a coward and a traitor, not his true grandfather. Although Ren admired Vader, he remained torn by his conflict and was afraid of never attaining the strength his grandfather possessed. He kept a shrine to Vader in his personal chambers aboard the Finalizer, with the charred remains of the Sith Lord's helmet that had been recovered from his funeral pyre on Endor. Sitting atop a ceremonial plate that Ren covered with the ashes of fallen foes, the site was both a monument to the dark side's powers and its weakness. Ren's efforts to make contact with Vader were motivated by his desire to feel his grandfather was proud of him. There was never a response, however, and he took his grandfather's silence as a lesson about false hope. As a result, Ren came to believe that there was nothing after death. He chose to leave his grandfather's mask aboard the Finalizer before transferring to Snoke's flagship, the Supremacy, unable to face the charred helmet until he recovered from his loss against Rey. He still treated Vader's mask with reverence after his ascension as Supreme Leader, placing the Sith relic atop a pedestal made of Mustafarian obsidian. During the final months of the war, the helmet was carefully preserved in a climate-controlled reliquary aboard the Steadfast; he went to great lengths to ensure the preservation of this artifact by storing it in a custom collector's case built by First Order technicians. As with Ren's quarters, the case was made for the purpose of preserving Vader's helmet, possessing temperature control systems. It also shielded its contents from radiation and sensor scans, its obviribdum outer shell designed to be impervious to blaster fire at considerable expense. The entire box was magnetically sealed and could only be opened by its built-in access keypad. Ultimately, the charred helm continued to serve as an instrument in Ren's meditations, despite his failed attempts to commune with the spirit of his ancestor who once wore it. It also served a symbolic purpose, representing the power embodied by Ren's grandfather, yet also \"weakness and dependency\" as Vader could not live outside of the mask. A rival for power[ ] - \"Someone in your army tried to kill you. Clearly, you've managed to inspire a lot of loyalty, Hux.\" \"Oh, please. I thought you could read minds, Ren. You honestly believe people hate me more than they hate you? With your petulant tantrums and your...\" \"And my Kylo Ren and Armitage Hux Despite Kylo Ren's status as the champion of the First Order, his rise within the organization attracted the hostility of General Armitage Hux. A rivalry developed between the two as they both sought the approval of Supreme Leader Snoke. Whereas Hux resented the mystical aspects of the First Order embodied by his rival, Ren considered the general untrustworthy and cowardly. Ren, who prided himself on his fighting skills, was unimpressed by Hux as a soldier. His low opinion of Hux was such that he could not fathom why the Supreme Leader favored a general who wanted to usurp his throne. Even as Ren held Hux in great contempt, he did share at least one commonality with the general: they preferred to keep their appearances and individual quarters simple. As someone who was used to flattery throughout his life, Ren was unaccustomed to directness, and when Hux confronted Ren about his insecurities about his heritage, the dark warrior came close to killing his adversary. Only the threat of Snoke's reprisal for killing his favorite officer prevented Ren from ending Hux's life. Shortly afterward, however, Ren made an effort to protect Hux when the two were attacked by a norwood, and was surprised to find that Hux had fled in the opposite direction, leaving Ren to fight the creature on his own. This incident reinforced Ren's views of Hux as a coward. The rivalry between Ren and Hux grew only stronger after Starkiller Base's destruction, with Ren increasingly irritated by Hux, who enjoyed knowing that his rival needed to be rescued after his defeat at the hands of a scavenger. Hux's confidence increased as Ren fell out of favor with Snoke, to the extent that he began patronizing Ren during the attack on the Resistance fleet. Ren swore to make the general pay for speaking to him like a child. Their rivalry ended when Ren usurped his master's throne, killing Snoke to become the new Supreme Leader. Ren did not hesitate to put Hux in his place by way of the dark side, and threatened to asphyxiate the general until he recognized Ren's claim. The new Supreme Leader decided on keeping Hux alive but close by; having never trusted the man whose ambitions were well known to Ren, he was certain that Hux would betray him at the earliest opportunity. Ren would remain suspicious of Hux throughout his reign. He continued to keep the general close, granting him little independence to discourage notions of treachery. He also took steps to diminish Hux's influence, such as favoring Allegiant General Enric Pryde with greater authority. Although Ren saw his actions towards Hux as petty, he still enjoyed exerting power at the expense of his former rival. During the last days of their conflict with the Resistance, Ren all but ignored Hux despite forcing him to remain part of his entourage, which included Pryde. For all of the actions that Ren took to neutralize Hux as a threat to his power, he never suspected that Hux was the informant who leaked classified information about the discovery on Exegol to the Resistance. When considering the possible identity of the spy in their ranks, Ren immediately dismissed Hux as a suspect. While his loyalty to Ren had always been in doubt, Ren never questioned Hux's allegiance to the First Order, and as such, he did not believe the general would do anything that could undermine the First Order's ability to win the war. - \"As fate tried to dictate her response, as love almost diverted her from her quest, she remained the only master of her destiny. She was a beacon of hope. She gave her life for the galaxy, and though it seems to become darker and darker, in the shadows her spark remains and guides us all.\" - Breha Organa tells Leia about Padm\u00e9 Amidala was compassionate to other people and stood her ground firmly for what she believed in. Amidala was a very persuasive and empathetic speaker during her time as a senator, especially when she opposed the escalation of the Clone Wars. She even started to doubt the Republic when the Senate gave Palpatine more executive powers near the end of the Clone Wars. Amidala could no longer ignore the needs of her people and accepted Queen R\u00e9illata's offer to become senator after two terms as queen. Due to her reputation as a beloved former monarch, Amidala kept several privileges such as her wardrobe and chrome-plated ships when she became a senator. Amidala was both responsible and strong-willed and did what she believed to be the right course of action despite objections from those closest to her. She spoke her mind to the Senate and was able to convince the Gungans to unite against the Trade Federation. Obi-Wan Kenobi described her as fearless and stubborn, and a leader. He also noted that Amidala was wise, discerning and kindhearted, and that her daughter Leia had inherited these qualities from her. Amidala could be seen as fearless when she refused additional security to protect herself from assassins. She also did not like the idea of leaving during the vote on the Military Creation Act. When Skywalker came back into her life, Amidala knew that their future together would endanger their lives. However, she gave in and married Skywalker in secret. Amidala's experiences during the Invasion of Naboo left her with a hate of Neimoidians, but she also admitted it was wrong of her to harbor a grudge against the entire species for the actions of the Trade Federation. As such, she admitted to Sab\u00e9 that she hated her prejudice as well. She worked to better herself and overcome her prejudice. Always at the center of the galaxy, Amidala was a determined and brave survivor. As recognized by Ahsoka Tano, Amidala was always thinking like a politician, focusing on gathering information and using her strengths to her advantage. Romance with Anakin Skywalker[ ] - \"Don't be afraid.\" \"I'm not afraid to die. I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"I love you.\" - Anakin and Padm\u00e9, prior to the First Battle of Geonosis When Amidala and Anakin first met, she thought that the nine-year-old boy from Tatooine was an amusing but knowledgeable child. However, by the end of the Invasion of Naboo, Amidala reciprocated Anakin's friendship; she helped him to cope with leaving his mother Shmi behind on Tatooine while Skywalker gave her a japor snippet so she could have good fortune. After a lifetime of shielding her heart from romance, she reunited with Skywalker ten years later and fell for him. The two both made mistakes that revealed the truth of themselves to the other. Amidala and Anakin confessed their love to each other during their stay at Naboo and before the Battle of Geonosis. After the battle, they were later secretly married. The couple didn't have time to figure their relationship out and were always stealing moments together in between missions. Amidala had once told Sab\u00e9 about how she feared that any romantic relationship she entered would be catastrophic, which was a description Sab\u00e9 believed was accurate upon learning how the marriage developed in the wake of events like the massacre of a Tusken tribe and the secrets it required of them both. Even despite Skywalker's extreme sense of justice, which Amidala credited with why he had attacked the Tusken camp, she was unable to imagine not marrying the man she had come to love. Anakin also showed extreme jealousy when Amidala went undercover to investigate Rush Clovis, who had also harbored romantic feelings for Amidala. This did not fade the next time Anakin saw him. When Anakin saw the two in Amidala's apartment, he mistakenly believed that Amidala was going to kiss Clovis and brutally attacked him. He later attempted to apologize to Amidala, but Amidala was greatly upset by Anakin's actions and the fact he didn't appear to trust her. Amidala claimed that their marriage was built on lies and that she no longer felt safe. She suggested that they shouldn't see each other for a while before leaving. Amidala later apologized for her words and took Anakin back. Upon discovering what her husband had done\u2014aiding Palpatine in overthrowing the Jedi Order and reorganizing the Republic into the First Galactic Empire\u2014Amidala confronted him on Mustafar where he tried to convince her to overthrow Palpatine so that they could rule the galaxy together, Amidala was horrified, claiming that she didn't know who Anakin was anymore. Anakin then saw Obi-Wan, who had snuck aboard Amidala's ship, and believing that his wife had betrayed him, and ignoring her protests on the matter, strangled Amidala with the Force until he was ordered to release her by Obi-Wan. lost the will to live, death haunted her for the rest of his life. - \"My hands are yours.

Much like seasoned Rebel pilot Shara Bey, Organa could manually pilot a Naboo N-1 starfighter through Naboo's planet-wide storms without an astromech droid and destroy several climate-disruption arrays before saving Bey from a TIE fighter. learned how to ride, steeplechase. knew how to plant and care for orchids, learnt and studied dance displayed his natural leadership acumen in several missions, eventually convincing the Alliance to offer the former smuggler a commission within the Rebellion's military. In time, Solo came to accept the commission. To that end, Captain Han Solo spearheaded several Alliance operations, utilizing the Millennium Falcon's speed and firepower to great effect in the ongoing plight against the Empire. By the time of the Battle of Endor, Solo had elevated to the rank of General within the Rebel Army, further demonstrating his leadership skills on the forested moon of Endor. Solo led the successful ground assault on the land-based shield generator of the second Death Star, during which he and Rebel Pathfinders detonate several detonite charges which disabled the deflector shield surrounding the battle station, thus allowing the Rebel fleet to commence its attack on the Death Star's main reactor. Despite her commitment to Alderaan's values of pacifism, Organa believed in self-defense and in fiercely fighting for the galaxy's freedom. She never cared much for being royalty, for her priority was to help those who needed her, and not wealth nor recognition. A woman of action, eager to get things done and making positive differences in the galaxy, Leia was impatient, a trait she shared with her brother, Luke. He believed that Leia's strength of will, which allowed her to continue despite events such as the destruction of Alderaan and the loss of her son, was a manifestation of her power in the Force. However, she also admitted to herself that some of her strength was fueled by desperation and even hatred at times. Constantly questioning whether she did the right thing, she came to the realization that she would willingly sacrifice those innocent lives again if it meant stopping the Empire. In her eyes, the cause was greater than any one person. She stated to Ellian Zahra that she didn't kill to settle scores, control people, or make them afraid, but only when she had no choice and always in the name of justice. As Leia grew older, however, she placed more value in protecting lives than destroying her enemies; \"jumping in an X-wing and blowing something up\" could not be a winning strategy against forces like the First Order if there were no people to fight for the cause. She had the wisdom to realize that the Resistance having a leader with this foresight was better than having a hero who took unnecessary risks. Aware of how others looked to her for leadership, she looked to other members of the Resistance like Poe Dameron to take on these responsibilities when she was gone. During the Clone Wars, when Clovis was suspected by the Jedi Council of aiding the Separatist cause, Amidala was sent to gather information on his dealings. Clovis, in turn, believed that Amidala wanted to resurrect their relationship and brought her to a Separatist meeting. However, Lott Dod poisoned Amidala to force Clovis in helping them financially. With the help of Anakin Skywalker, Amidala's husband, Clovis did all to ensure Amidala's survival, yet Skywalker left him behind. In 19 BBY, Clovis manipulated Amidala to expose the corruption of the InterGalactic Banking Clan so he could be selected as head, but all went wrong. Realizing that Skywalker loved Amidala, Clovis let himself die in order to save Amidala. Ren was puzzled by the strange connection he felt with Rey during their first encounter. He was also astonished by her ability to read his mind while he probed hers, which allowed her to sense Ren's thoughts as well as his inner conflict and doubts. To Ren's surprise, Rey evoked feelings of compassion within him, according to Snoke, who decried his apprentice's sentimentality as a form of weakness. Ren denied his Master's accusations, unable to comprehend how he could feel anything except hatred for an enemy of the First Order. Nevertheless, he offered to make Rey his apprentice after gauging her raw strength in the Force. Even though she defeated him, Ren had sensed that their destinies were somehow intertwined. He plotted his own path to regain the power and status he lost to her blade. Rey's fate was inextricably tied to his own, and he was unable to deny their Force-bond. Henceforth, Ren's churning emotions were as much about Rey as they were himself. do not fear death but understand the value of a fleeting life and believe that no matter the struggle, one should not go quietly into death. Lorkh represents a will to live despite of the certainty of death. They believe everyone deserves to be able to die under the open sky, rather than hidden in darkness. There is common belief among the Reachfolk that their ancestors observe them from the sky above and await reunion during which the stories of the battles their descendants fought will be exchanged. They believe that any death has significance, no matter how great or small. Namira, who is known as the Spirit Queen, the Goddess of Death, and the Black Fly, is a revered spirit in the Reachman pantheon that represents darkness, endings, and rebirth. She is seen as the sovereign of the infinite world of spirit, one of the two worlds of existence. The Reachfolk creation story speaks of Lorkh having an epiphany when he visited the darkness; that which is perceived as nothingness is ripe for possibility. And so, Lorkh approached Namira and convinced her to grant him a place in the infinite void to create a realm for wayward spirits, but it was not without a cost. Lorkh sacrificed himself to create a harsh realm, one that is unforgiving and intended to teach through suffering. Hircine took the mantle of Lorkh's creation, becoming the sovereign the second world: the realm of flesh. The Reachfolk believe that Hircine will fight alongside them at the \"end of all days\". Hircine and Namira's roles complement each other. While Reachfolk dwell in the world of the living, Hircine is a guide that helps them navigate Nirn's hardships. Upon death, Namira acts as a psychopomp for Reachman souls that gives and takes lives, until their spirits are enlightened. Thus, Namira is seen as the avatar of primal dualisms, such as beginnings and ends, which stem from her world of spirit. At the \"end of all days\", Hircine will fight alongside the Reachmen, and Lorkh's Dark Heart will beat again, reawakened by feeding on the deaths of mortals, and its darkness will spread from its depths to consume everything, sparing only Namira's faithful. Hircine engenders a sense of urgency; the unease needed to keep the people of the Reach safe, as there may be another threat looming over the horizon. Thus, Hircine has reason to be cruel in his lessons. He also taught the Reachfolk how to hunt, fight, and survive, all in an effort to make them swifter, stronger, and more cunning. The briarheart ritual is reflective of this need to improve, and involves communing with Hircine to ritualistically replace the heart of a skilled Reachfolk warrior with poisoned briars. Reachfolk religion puts a huge emphasis on the concepts of the suffering and self-sacrifice and this ritual in particular represents Lorkh's immortal sacrifice, which is reflected by an act of self sacrifice - ending one's own life for the protection of their loved ones, with the end result being that the warrior is resurrected as a living weapon with great strength and endurance at the cost of the feeling of the unending, constant pain. These warriors are called \"Briarhearts\". wear amulets, talismans or other trinkets connected to their understanding of the death. members are responsible for crafting their own talisman which is unique to that person and their family. It represents the relationship between hunter and prey, and is deeply personal to their beliefs about life and death. Those talismans are an important part of guiding their loved one's spirit home and are kept by living relatives of the deceased. Bear-Heart Clan also fashioned similar trinkets. Amulets that belonged to the deceased who were banished from the clan are buried it on the banks of the Karth River in order to bring peace to the spirit of the fallen. This belief is shared by at least some Reachfolk who are not part of those clans. It is known that they share the funerary practice of burial with their Nord neighbours, Breton cousins and Nedic forefathers. Warriors of the Spiritblood who felt defending the ways of their ancestors are honored by having Totems of the Brave erected in their honor. They were also granted immortality in form of the vateshran song that was was passed down and sung forever. Vateshran are responsible for ritualistical commemoration of the dead ancestors. Cairns are scattered across the landscape of the Reach and some of them are known to be erected by the Reachfolk in places where blood of their brethren was spilled and are often used as grave markers. Reachfolk of Markarth typically practiced burial, as well. In certain circumstances cremation is also performed. Mortally wounded or dead, Red Eagle was carried by the weeping cortege up the crag at dawn. Reachfolk followed with pots of resin and ash in order to prepare his body for burial. Ashes were scattered to lay upon his body which was exposed to the chiefs of numerous clans. According to Reachfolk ceremony was interrupted by Hag who took the briarheart from Faolan's chest despite the protests of the attendants. Once she left the ceremony continued and he was carried into the deep cave in the heart of the mountain which was a place of a prepared tomb and then he was \"laid bare for the last time in sleepless rest\" in the tomb. The stone was sealed, wax poured and flints shattered. After the burial numerous traps were set to dissuade intruders and grave robbers. The resting place appeared unadorned at first but in the deeper parts of the tomb the rippled rock walls were replaced by ornate man made walls of hewn stone and covered with chiseled murals depicting scenes of Red Eagle's final battle. Despite the rich ornamentation of the room and later parts of the corridor that led to it the sarcophagus placed on dais in the central part of the chamber was simple and unadorned. Faolan was buried with his legendary weapon - Red Eagle's Bane, which was put on a pedestal near to his body. Alcohol is a commodity that the more open-minded clans of the Reach are willing to trade for. Much of the Reach is unsuitable for the barley fields, vineyards, apiaries with which other cultures brew their drinks. Clans who don't have much contact with the outside world make do with what they have. Reach-made drinks are found primarily in the form of hard ciders. The flavor depends on the variety of apple used and the time of year they're pressed. Apple orchards are uncommon in the Reach, but many apples grow in the region's forests and river valleys. Each clan that lives where the fruit grows has their own preferred method for brewing cider. Reachfolk often turn goat skulls into drinking vessels such as goblets. They also drink from mugs made of Dwarven metal. It is considered impolite to decline a drink served in the vessel made of skull. Various clans of the Reach have different traditions related to alcohol beverages. Stranglehollow clan used to toast each other with a drink mixed using the fingerbone of an ancestor. Worms are occasionally added to drinks in order to give them 'an extra kick'. Grains and dried meat are staple foodstuffs for the Reachfolk. Feasts are rare in the Reach, as the land is unforgiving. When they do occur, the Reachfolk make a spectacle of it. Reachfolk typically eat with their hunting knives, a crust to sop with, and with a tool that resembles a short quilting needle. considers spilling blood on a feast day unacceptable. unpolished and barbaric, far from primitive, techniques for refining ores. most naturally talented warrior. The dark-skinned, coarse-haired, seem born to battle, though their pride and fierce independence of spirit makes them more suitable as scouts or skirmishers, or as free-ranging heroes and adventurers. In addition to their cultural affinities for many armor styles and weapons (particularly swords), hardy constitutions, resistance to poison, and quickness of foot. Their culture was at one point almost entirely oral, though they had developed glyphs and amulets inscribed with markings. ore refinement and tattoo inks, the fiercest and most skilled warrior-smiths earned the right to wear face and body markings to signify their status. annual hunt competition. gave their bear cubs fresh markings once each season to gain Hircine's favor. Lustrous Folk, silver-skinned. A lifetime of conflict and loneliness caused Ren to find solace in his connection with Rey, and he developed an \"insatiable\" fascination with her. His emotional state became even more intense as their Force-bond grew stronger; to Rey's surprise, Ren no longer bothered trying to hide his pain and misery from her. Despite lowering his mental barriers, Ren was still guarded with his feelings as Rey attempted to learn more about his fall to the dark side and specifically his actions in regard to Han Solo. While her inquisitive nature amused Ren, he would raise his guard by using deflection and derision to avoid Rey's questions about his conflict and his father. Ren treated Rey as though they were master and student, keeping her at bay and off balance by his questions. His facade, however, broke when Rey called him by the name he had been born with. In that moment, he looked lost. It seemed that the war destroyed her religious beliefs. Though Mal lost faith in God and religion, he retained a strong faith in humanity; he mentioned to River Tam that he had risked the lives of his crew on the theory that River was human and not just a living weapon as the Operative claimed. Though wary in his personal dealings, he put great stock in the fundamental goodness of people in general. This faith in an individual's ability to do the right thing manifested strongly in his very negative view of governmental institutions. \"Governments,\" he said, are for \"getting in a man's way.\" The Alliance, whose government seemed particularly fond of interference and regulation, was thus his ideological nemesis. His contempt for the Alliance never completely disappeared (although he once said that he \"wouldn't mind makin' a buck off 'em\", and was shown in multiple episodes willing to steal Alliance supplies for a job, as long as it doesn't affect the people), and, although he was on the losing side of the Unification War, years later he still wasn't convinced it was the wrong one. Mal expressed what seemed to be his manifesto\u2014\"[The Alliance] will swing back to the belief that they can make people... better. And I do not hold to that. So no more running. I aim to misbehave.\" His anti-government attitude was reflected in his choice to live on a spaceship, drifting from world to world, as far away from Alliance interference as possible. The ship was a means of escaping the loss of the war and the resulting Alliance dominance over the systems, and Mal's attempts to get by in a Universe that had forsaken him. He took whatever jobs he could get, turning a blind eye if he could to the legality of the job, but never doing the wrong thing in terms of morality (he will happily steal medicine supplies from Ariel for sale on the black market as none of it will be missed on a central planet, but in the episode The Train Job, he returns the medicine he discovers is stolen as he knows the Alliance won't get another shipment to them in time). He was a man of compassion (refusing jobs that would involve him in slavery, for instance), with a strong sense of nobility. He was, however an anti-hero (or perhaps more specifically, a partial moral relativist) and would kill those who threatened him with a philosophy that, \"If someone tries to kill you, you try and kill 'em right back.\" He was not above joking with his crew or picking bar fights, but he retained his honor in the face of adversity. What separated him from typical heroes was that Mal was the type of person who was willing to shoot first and skip the question; oftentimes not even bothering with a \"fair fight.\" He was not above petty theft, smuggling, or even killing, but often rationalized such behavior to make it appear more noble or valiant, such as stealing from Slavers. very protective of her crew and fiercely loyal. retained the idea that you never left someone behind and, once you are a part of her crew, you are assured her protection. treated an attack on a member of her crew as being tantamount to a direct assault on her and would not stand for it. a natural leader, inspiring loyalty that was reciprocated. good in a fight, and acted before she thought on many occasions. also somewhat thuggish and cruel; often appeared to be somewhat stupid, she had her own peculiar wit. had a keen sense of danger and was often the first to raise an accurate warning about impending peril. often a strict mercenary, Jayne had his own code of honor. He was loyal to his employer as long as he was being paid well. When he had not acted up to his code of honor, he worked to atone for it, for instance by buying a crate of fresh apples and sharing it with the crew of the ship for what he did on Ariel. Jayne also demonstrated unexpected sentimentality when it was revealed that he sent some of the money earned by his mercenary activities home to his mother, Radiant Cobb. He also proudly sported a ridiculous orange knit cap with earflaps, simply because his mother made it for him. Despite his occasionally harsh attitude, Jayne demonstrated that he truly did care about his fellow crew members; after Kaylee was accidentally shot by Lawrence Dobson, Jayne was naturally angered by this, but another side of this was shown when he was huddling by the window of the infirmary in bated breath to see if Kaylee survived the operation, and he went out of his way to help Mal close all air vents leading below deck to buy the former time to repair Serenity's engines when the life-support is down and even prepped a spacesuit for Mal for when he ran out of air without being told to do so (while Mal does appreciate this, he tells Jayne that he won't need it). Also, when Mal was about to space him as punishment for betraying Simon and River to the Alliance, Jayne told him with complete sincerity to lie to the other crew members about the reason for his death, caring about what they thought about him in the end; however, even before the Feds double-crossed him in order to take the reward money for themselves, he showed remorse for what he was about to do, especially after seeing Simon potentially risk the mission he arranged to save a man who had almost died due to his doctor's incompetence. After he discovered what the Alliance had done to River, he was willing to abandon the plan entirely. Jayne kept a large arsenal in his bunk on Serenity. He had named his favorite and most powerful gun, a Callahan full-bore auto lock with customized trigger double cartridge thorough gauge, Vera. He acquired it after killing the previous owner, one of six assassins trying to kill him. After packing Vera into an oxygenated spacesuit so he could fire through outer space, Jayne preserved Serenity by disabling a carrion house (he also took care to kill the scrappers by shooting out their window, too). Jayne frequently carried a handgun based on a LeMat Percussion Revolver, and later carried a rifle named Lux. Jayne doesn't have many acknowledged fears, but he has shown near-panic at anything to do with Reavers, a subpopulation of feral humans. He was convinced that fugitives Simon and his sister River Tam would bring the Alliance down on them, and this concern fueled his dislike of the Tams. He also had a notable fear of River, who slashed him in the chest once and unnerved him with her occasional outbursts, creating a rift that her generally sweet (albeit odd) nature did not help to heal. Jayne also demonstrated fear of dying in what he considered an unmanly manner, notably being \"spaced.\" \"If you can't do something smart, ... do something right'\" A laid-back guy with a dry and occasionally laconic sense of humor, Wash tended to represent the pragmatic, cut-and-run opinion in any shipboard debate, and often served as the calming influence in heated arguments. His actions sometimes appeared cowardly (or at least less-than-heroic), but Wash had proven his resolve and willingness to both put himself in harm's way and do violence on behalf of his friends on many occasions. His loyalty to his fellow crew was unshakable, as is shown when he insisted on rescuing Mal from the clutches of the crime lord Adelai Niska, despite clashing with Mal over Zo\u00eb earlier and having been severely tortured by Niska to the point of barely being able to stand. As a pilot, her flying style oscillated between near panic and a Zen-like calm. The attitude she conveyed seemed to be in inverse proportion to the degree of danger she believed she and the ship were in at any particular moment, acting the most calm when facing the greatest danger. mantra, quietly recited during a highly stressful situation, was \"I am a leaf on the wind; watch how I soar,\" affinity for strawberries. \"On Sihnon, we started training at twelve, years of discipline and preparation before the physical act of pleasure was even mentioned.

Tall, with brown parted hair and blue/green eyes, Rick O'Connell was usually seen wearing a white long-sleeved shirt and tan chinos, along with brown boots, belt, and holsters when he was on expeditions; this outfit was accompanied sometimes by a blue kerchief as well as any number of firearms and blades. Years later, Rick would sometimes wear a blue shirt, designated as his favourite, in place of the white one, still wearing his holsters with shoes in place of his boots. Rick usually wore a leather wristband on his right wrist to conceal the tattoo that was given to him in a Cairo orphanage years ago; this tattoo designating him a Medjai. Rick's preferred knife in combat was a butterfly knife. When at home in London years after his exploits, Rick wore clothing typical of an English civilian: a necktie and vest, changing into a suit and tie for more serious events, accompanied by a fedora and trench coat when out of his home. Formal events saw Rick wear a tuxedo, but taking great care to keep his holsters under the jacket, equipped with guns, should trouble arise. Evelyn was an English woman living in Cairo, hoping to reach the greatness that her father before her had in Egyptology, in 1926. Skittish at times, and confidant in some situations, Evelyn was relentless in her goals. A young, attractive woman with brown hair and hazel eyes, Evelyn was said to have inherited her looks from her mother; but; regardless of her looks; which turned heads often, she did not see herself as particularly unattractive or attractive, often wearing mannish outfits; such as jodhpurs and oversized cardigans; ten years afterward, this habit was changed, as she began to wear clothes made from fabrics from Egypt. Evelyn, having inherited her father's love of egyptology, knew how to read and write ancient texts well, and understand ancient tongues. From time-to-time in her youth, Evelyn wore rimmed spectacles to read books, although she did not need them. she retained her passion for knowledge, but had also become more mature and less frightened. brave, clever and impetuous, but was also known to have an eye for trouble.

During the pursuit of the Scrolls of Thebes, Alex's accent changed, as did his garb, as he sported a shorts and a blue shirt that he switched for Medjai robes when he began to train to join the order.

Jayne was regarded as something of a Robin Hood-like folk hero by the people of Canton on Higgins' Moon. They erected a statue of him in the center of the town and sung a song dedicated to \"the hero of Canton, the man they call Jayne\" (\"The Ballad of Jayne Cobb\") in which they tell how \"he robbed from the rich and he gave to the poor.\" The true story was, however, less heroic. Jayne and his then-partner Stitch Hessian did indeed steal from Magistrate Higgins and drop the money on the town, but this was only because during his escape, Jayne's ship was attacked and damaged, and he needed to lose a lot of weight from the ship just to keep it flying. Jayne dumped the money in desperation, but only after having already thrown out his unfortunate partner. It was while visiting Canton that he let his emotional walls down the most, becoming deeply disturbed when the townspeople continued to idolize him after learning the truth. He tried to deal with this, even going to Mal for help in doing so. \"That young man is very brave. He gave up everything to free his sister from that place. Go from being a doctor on the central planets to hiding on the fringes of the system...There is not many who could do that.\" Ren understood Rey's feelings of solitude and abandonment; having experienced such emotions as well, he was all too familiar with the psychological effect they had on a person in the long term. He allowed Rey to confide in him and insisted that she was not alone. When Snoke ordered his apprentice to complete his training by killing Rey, Ren knew what he had to do. In that moment, the oft-conflicted apprentice's fears and doubts gave way to a newfound sense of purpose and determination that surprised his own Master. He did not hesitate to kill the one he considered his true enemy, who turned out to be Snoke instead of Rey. Ren wanted Rey to be like him, yet his brutal honesty gave way to a softer approach when he beseeched her to join him, telling Rey that while she was no one, she was still important to him. Rey's refusal to join Ren left the dark warrior feeling betrayed. He wondered why Rey had not taken the opportunity to kill him while he was unconscious, and for a moment he contemplated the possibility that Rey actually cared for him. He pushed such thoughts aside, however, convinced that Rey's feelings made her foolish and sentimental, and would be the death of her. Ren vowed to destroy Rey along with everyone else who opposed him, but upon seeing her again through their bond, he was left with a feeling of emptiness despite his recent accomplishments, which included his ascension as the new Supreme Leader. Despite his complete submission to the dark side of the Force, Ren's conflict remained and he was still tempted by the light side. He had thought that his father's death would bring an end to the agony within, only to realize, in time, that Han Solo represented his past, whereas Rey personified what he felt as the pull to the light. Though he was bidden to kill the scavenger by the clone of Darth Sidious, Ren feigned compliance. The discovery of her full origins reignited his desire to turn her to the dark side, yet he was also conflicted over whether it was worth the risk, now that he knew his struggle against the light was directly tied to Rey. His uncertainty was compounded by feelings of anger and resentment over her rejection of his first offer, which confounded Ren. Ren sensed the terror that Rey felt whenever he was near her, and found it intoxicating, though her determination to resist him infuriated. The thought that she had dared to reject him fueled his rage, causing Ren to lose himself to his anger and hatred, forgetting for a moment about his plans to overthrow the Emperor and take control of the Star Destroyer fleet. Blinded by overwhelming rage and desperate to end his pain, he succumbed to the temptation of killing her. When the attempt failed, Ren chided himself for allowing Rey to use his anger against him, though he was even more stunned by the realization that he was relieved he had not killed her. acting on his impulses, but now the impulse to kill Rey could not be reconciled with his deepest desire, for the thing he wanted most was Rey herself. He found the effort of tempting Rey difficult, yet worthwhile, and with each encounter between them, he felt increasingly closer to achieving his goal with her. Ren also came to understand that his plans for her required planning and patience, but he was well aware of his impatience and temper. As a result, he found inspiration in Rey's grandfather Sidious, wanting to be able to embrace a plan so long suffering and painstakingly careful, and being able to do it without feeling tempted by the light. Ren knew that he did not have the Emperor's patience, but in his desire to convert Rey, he was willing to learn it. mercurial nature inspired fear amongst his subordinates. Her presence had a calming effect on him. found himself enjoying the experience of seeing Rey in person again, taking little notice of the dead and the injured around him. For Ren, any loss was a small price to pay to be with Rey. He delighted in provoking her rage; he wanted her to know that they were a dyad in the Force; and he enjoyed seeing the look on her face, which he regarded as beautiful, when he finally told her. After discarding the persona of Ren, Solo developed a new sense of purpose, which was to protect Rey. The need that he felt to stand at her side determined his actions for the remainder of his life, including his decision to die for her. Solo's return to the light also had an effect on his connection to Rey, changing the way the bond felt between them. Unlike with Ren, when the two halves of the dyad fought on opposite sides of the Force, the connection with Solo felt right to Rey. The differences between the personalities of Solo and Ren, as well as the way they fought as one on the side of the light, convinced Rey that this was how the bond between them was always meant to be. By standing together against Sidious, Solo and Rey achieved their true potential as a dyad in the Force, making their combined strength an equivalent to the power of life. What it means to be a Breton is considered an age-old quandary by their people. To make sense of it all, some may focus on a specific aspect on their culture, or seek to blend it all together. Some Bretons hold their elven heritage in high esteem, which may influence them to worship Phynaster, the patron deity and \"teacher\" of the Direnni. Others attempt to seek out the druidic roots of their Nedic ancestors and reconnect with nature. Knighthood is pivotal to the Breton identity; its earliest practitioners served under Clan Direnni, but knights are credited with kickstarting High Rock's modern cultural history through tales of liberating the race from their Elven oppressors. These knights of old set the example for those that followed by going on grand quests for adventure and glory. In their free time, Breton youths of all walks of life imitate knights through chivalric pursuits in their thoughts or by their actions. Indeed, the profession encapsulates the traditional chivalric principles of Breton society, and the \"quest-obsession\" that has become a national identity for High Rock. poets and artists, famed Academy of Art, haunted, and ghost stories abound among the populace. open market for goods, dealing peacefully to its benefit. center of culture. center of trade, melting pot of cultural aspects.

Many Breton cemeteries are designed to provide direct sunlight on certain graves on highly specific high holy days on the Breton calendar. constructed in a series of concentric bands atop a hill, with the oldest, most prestigious graves positioned in the high center of the graveyard. - Scour Day is celebrated by villages in High Rock on the 2nd of Morning Star, the day after New Life. It was once a day to clean up after New Life, but has changed into a party of its own. - Waking Day was invented by the people of the Yeorth Burrowland in prehistoric times to wake the spirits of nature after a long and cold winter, but has evolved into a sort of orgiastic celebration of the end of winter. The Bretons of the Burrowlands share stories about the \"Terrible Torchbug of Molag Bal\" the night before Waking Day which vary but share the one consistent element of a fearsome, savage entity in the presence of blue torchbugs. - Flower Day is a lively, colorful and frivolous spring celebration observed all over High Rock which is just as old, if not older than Waking Day. Children pick new flowers, while older Bretons come out to welcome the season with dancing and singing. In Camlorn, a lavish parade called the March of Beauty precedes the Flower Festival, which occurs at dusk. During the march (which starts at the Temple of Sethiete and ends at the palace), prostitutes dance down the main street, dressed provocatively and in bright colors. A circle of twelve unlit torches and baskets full of flowers and vines are arranged around Cavilstyr Rock for the Festival. At sundown, the torches are lit, and the dancers from the parade (and soon after, the crowd) begin the event by pulling petals out of the baskets and filling the air with them. The spectacle is accompanied by music and dancing. - The Day of the Dead is celebrated in Daggerfall on the 13th of Rain's Hand. It is a remnant of ancestor worship, which was a hallmark of the ancient Breton religion. The superstitious say that the dead rise on this holiday to wreak vengeance on the living. - Marukh's Day is only observed by certain communities in Skeffington Wood. Celebrants compare themselves to the prophet Marukh and pray for the strength to resist temptation. - The Fire Festival in Northmoor is one of the most attended celebrations in High Rock. It began as a pompous display of magic and military strength in ancient days and has become quite a festival. - Dancing Day is celebrated in Daggerfall on the 23rd of Mid Year, and is a celebration of great pomp and merriment for all. - In the 13th of Frost Fall, Bretons along with the rest of Tamriel celebrates the Witches Festival to defy their superstitious fears. Ghosts, demons, and evil spirits are mocked and celebrated by both occult occurrences and outrageous costumes. On this day, portals between Nirn and the Daedra Lord Hollowjack's demi-plane of Detritus are opened. At night, Jaque o' the Hollow is resurrected from his hidden hollow in Rivenspire, who then proceeds to curse riders all across Tamriel to ride headless throughout the night, clutching a carved pumpkin atop their mounts. This led to his legend spreading far east past High Rock. - The Moon Festival is an older holiday celebrated by the Bretons of Glenumbra Moors to honor Secunda, goddess of the moon, just as the nights are growing longer. Though she has no active worshippers, the holiday is a time of feasting and merriment. - Bretons celebrate Saturalia, a holiday that heralds the New Life Festival. Originally a holiday held to celebrate a forgotten god of debauchery, it has transformed into a day where gifts are given, parades are held, and feasts are had. architecture venerates the divine nature of the moons in their ancient stone architecture, stilted houses and pointed roofs. impractical to wear heavy clothing and armor, ample shawl of brightly-colored cloth, known as a budi, for defense against the harsh rays of the sun. This shirt is tightly fastened in braids down the right side, to prevent any part of the torso from being seen, martial efficiency is a priority, naturally lithe frames and dexterity, quilted or padded with cloth around the midriff and vital areas. Medium-weight armor is exquisitely fashioned from loose-fitting leather, and the heaviest armor is leather overlaid with lacquered and highly-burnished metal plates, dislikes restraint, only under the most harrowing of conditions will they don full battle armor, flamboyant in their fashion choices and, as a result, their light armor is often mistaken for flamboyant clothing, bedeck themselves with jewelry, trinkets, and occasionally even herbs such as Nightshade. Their tattoos often have a deep cultural and religious significance, as they signify their race, tribe, and the gods of their worship. The art of Claw-Dances (known as the Rain-of-Sand fighting styles by the other races of Tamriel) refers to the Khajiiti martial arts, which play a major part in the race's history and philosophy. They are considered synonymous with the unarmored form of defense. There are many different disciplines that can generally be taught in the Temple of Two-Moons Dance, but they are known to be studied in their own monasteries, commonly known throughout the province of Elsweyr as the adeptoriums. While most see Claw-Dances as a form of combat, they are meant to be lyrical meditation, much different than the other races' forms of meditation, which are quiet and lack motion. The claw-dances draw upon the nervous energy that emanates from the monks, which finds expression in raw physicality. The predatorial instinct of the Khajiit and the natural range of motion of their claws give rise to this distinct form of martial art that incorporates claw-strikes and wide leaps. Some nomadic clans partake in a ritual before eating with guests. The first meal is cake, which is round in shape, and laid down on a cloth at each participants' spot. The server sets each individual place at the dining area with a platter of cakes, a stack of cloths, and a pitcher of golden liquid. They set down a cloth, put a cake on the cloth, sprinkle the cake with moon-sugar, then let exactly four drops of liquid drip onto the dusted cake. This is repeated exactly for each participant. Then, everybody introduces themselves. When the last person's name is given, the Khajiit first lick their cakes, then eat them. Non-Khajiit can simply touch the cake to their mouth without eating it, as these cakes contain moon-sugar. Touching the cake to one's mouth satisfies the spirit of the ceremony. Those who eat cake with a Khajiiti clan are considered friends for the time being. They may offer strangers protection the day the cake is eaten, but the next time they meet, they have no obligation to be friendly. The Khajiit often refer to Moon Sugar as \"crystallized moonlight\", trapped by the glimmering waters of the Topal Sea and washed to the sugarcane groves of the Tenmar Forest by the tides, under the guidance of Hermorah. The Khajiit believe that by consuming it, they are consuming a small portion of the eternal souls of the moon gods, Jone and Jode. It drives them into fits of ecstasy and abandon, purportedly leaving the streets of Elsweyr's major cities strewn with catmen shivering in the grip of sugar-fits. Despite the extremely addictive nature of the sugar, it is an integral part of Khajiit life and the chief export of Elsweyr, where it is smuggled out in both raw and refined forms. It helps support a thriving black market; it is said one can purchase practically anything among the Khajiit. Khajiit of the desert tribes are often buried with only a small cairn of stones, so their bodies can be easily used by necromancers. Moon-Singer, keeper of lore, storyteller of ancient tales and legends, well respected. - The Baandari Pedlars (or simply the Baandari) are a clan of nomadic Khajiiti merchants that travel all over Tamriel, going as far as the northern regions of the Iliac Bay and the Western Reach, or the elven territories of Valenwood and the Summerset Isles. Despite the animosity they experience from the other races, they are inclusive when it comes to recruiting non-Khajiit into their ranks. They live by a code of conduct known as the \"Baandari Code,\" which states that loose items are rightfully salvageable, the peddlers must indulge clients in prophecies they want to believe in, and guarantee them of a product's utmost value and versatility. The Baandari Clan live by this lifestyle and with no other alternative as it is set in stone. They considered themselves the \"wandering litter\" of Baan Dar, the Bandit God of southern Tamriel. They adopt the god's will, as seen in their name. Breton villages and towns are varied depending on their location, for example, buildings in mountainous regions such as Kambria are fully stone. In southwestern High Rock, buildings are comprised of wood or stone with thatched roofs. Breton cities are described as having an austere grandeur. According to Imperial sources, function is valued over form, resulting in earthen, hand-crafted dwellings free from ornament. In reality, Breton architecture often features patternwork, sometimes exceptionally ornate; basic patterns include common Breton motifs such as the trefoil and basic knotwork, while more ornate examples on buildings such as castles, cathedrals, and guild buildings feature detailed friezes, bas reliefs, and intricate stained glass windows. Breton architecture features heavy use of the pointed arch, evident in their walls, doors, windows, and towers. Most people in High Rock live in small cottages in the countryside or townhouses in the cities; only the nobility and their servants live in large castles. Despite efforts under Tiber Septim to demilitarize the province by demolishing defensive structures, many villages are still surrounded by high walls, and fortresses dot the landscape. The Bretons' largely agrarian and hierarchical society is feudal in nature. High Rock is segmented into city-states, encouraging petty nationalism and infighting between the kingdoms that span the region. Most Breton cities are sprawling trade hubs, with society being separated into social strata. The poor peasantry lies at the bottom of the hierarchy. Above them is the middle class, comprised of merchants and artisans, while the nobility and ruling families sit above them all. Additionally, there are the many autonomous knightly orders and the small magical elite, which considers itself above the others. The jockeying for power among the various monarchs and powers of the Iliac Bay region is a deeply ingrained, even cherished, part of Breton culture, Breton society is fractious and quarrelsome, but internal conflict all but seems to disappear when their way of life is threatened by outside forces.

The Bretons believe that two opposing forces have existed since before the gods were born. They are referred to as the Light and the Dark by some. They are antithetical to each other, and neither fit the mortal definition of good and evil. They are technically immortal, as they're not living beings, but they exist. The Aedra and Daedra are pale reflections of the eternal conflict between the Light and Dark. Their struggle creates energies that distort their surroundings, and those energies are so powerful that life can appear. The Light and the Dark are evenly matched, and will never resolve their conflict. The undead and the Daedra tend to align with the Dark, as their natures are more akin to it. Mortals and the creatures of Mundus are more aligned with the Light. The evils of mortalkind are not always attuned to the Dark, but those that do are incredibly dangerous. Magic is believed to come directly from the energies swirling about both entities: the energies are impersonal intermingled. Black magic is more a matter of intent than effect. Destruction spells on their own are not black magic, but destruction spells hurled at innocent people are. The destruction of Daedra strengthens the light just a little, and the destruction of a Tamrielic creature strengthens the Dark in much the same way. The gods are believed to mostly align with the Light, save for a few who are more ambiguous. Mortals and those that reside in Aetherius can perceive traces of the Light and Dark; the Light inspires most mortals to behavior deemed good by human standards. What the denizens of Mundus can perceive of the Dark is utterly evil by human standards; those who have visions of the Dark are often driven mad. The Dark is described as an emptiness that draws the soul in to be twisted and destroyed. Ancestor worship seems to be an integral part of Tsaesci culture, although at least four deities, symbolizing different elements, are known: also be worshipped by the Tsaesci, as origins of his mythology can be traced back to Akavir. The Proving Festival is an important, yearly holiday of the Tsaesci to appease the ancestors and prove one's worth. It consists of three proofs which a participant has to pass: The first is the Proof of Reverence by which the ancestors are invoked and invited to enter the living world as spirits. The inhabitants of Hakoshae, Imperial descendants of Tsaesci, let a paper lotus be carried down a river. The lotus symbolically swims into the realm of the dead to attract the attention of the ancestors. The second proof is the Proof of Strength. It serves to show the ancestors ones strength and that one can resist various dangers. The last proof is the Proof of Wisdom. Traditionally it consisted of scholars drafting grand essays, writers composing ornate poems or philosophers performing lengthy debates. However in Hakoshae the inhabitants use riddles for that purpose. Arms and Armor[edit][ ] Two Akaviri \"Blood Drinker\" swords, known as Dawn/Duskfang and Bloodthirst, emulate the rumored traits of their Tsaesci creators. Although some sources claim Tsaesci fight without shields or armor, using only swords such as the Dai-katana in combat, eye-witness accounts from the battle at Pale Pass describe the Tsaesci not only using armor and shields, but also various types of weapons. The nature of the race is a tapestry of historical contradictions, so what little is known about them is uncertain. However, all known encounters with the Tsaesci have not only confirmed that they are humanoids, but that they also use armor and shields in combat. However, it should be noted that the Tsaesci use shields mostly as a form of ceremonial and decorative armor, and don't find widespread use in combat. The wakizashi is an elegant and refined single-edged version of the more common double-edged longswords of Western design. Because the weapons themselves are rare, and few smiths know how to make them, they are not common. he wasn't, which lead to him being tormented by them as he had no power to literally protect himself. He was noticeably selfless with his interactions with Davina who saw him twice as a corporeal spirit not wanting her to be under The Strix influence and offering himself up as bait so she would have time to escape The Ancestors. His concern for Davina was such that he didn't want to be resurrected if the means to do it hurt her in any way. Eventually, Davina managed to revive him back into his original body as a vampire. Kol became a witch when he was brought back from the other side to possess Kaleb. His personality seems to be quite similar to how he acted previously, though less directly hostile, a combination of being not as invincible and powerful, as well as no longer having that part of him heightened by vampirism. He remains cheeky and even a little bit self-absorbed - as when he mocked Davina's music taste before crediting himself with being able to help her improve it. He also showed previously known traits when he says that he loves his new body, demonstrating his vanity while sucking up to his mother at the same time. However, Kol quickly showed disdain for no longer being indestructible, hating that he could get hurt and that his wounds wouldn't heal quickly, saying that it had been a thousand years since he had received a scar. He also continued to demonstrate a love for culture that was only previously hinted at, hanging out at the record store and once again mentioning his love for modern music. Kol's previous interest in magic was even more prominent, now that he could practice it personally again as a witch. Due to being more vulnerable and in a weaker witch body, Kol had to rely on cunning deception to win his battles. feminine and mer-like in appearance, fin-like ears and scaly-striped skin. colors ranging from blue and green, and their hair color can range greatly from black to silver, or even blue like their skin tone. They adorn themselves in shells, seaweed, and even coral that is fashioned into clothing. They can also be seen wearing bracers crafted from metal, like gold or plain silver. Attached to these bracers is a long and tattered robe of sorts. The dwarven social hierarchy is ruled by complex, interrelated, and rigid castes. The casteless, commonly known as \"dusters\" after their ghetto of Dust Town, are the lowest rung of dwarven society; outcasts in their own city, unable to take up work among the higher castes, nor to defend their honor in the Provings or fight the darkspawn to protect the city, dwarves rejected by the Stone itself. Dwarves who are exiled or born on the surface are also officially casteless - but with an increase in the number of higher-caste dwarves choosing to live on the surface, it is becoming difficult for some surface dwarves to be considered permanent exiles. The average dwarf will never see the surface, and often will have superstitious beliefs concerning surface-life (such as falling into the sky, or the sun falling to the ground). Above the casteless are servants, artisans, miners, smiths, merchants, warriors and nobles. Among the nobles, the deshyrs are a group of dwarves who participate in the Assembly on behalf of their house. While it is possible for some dwarves to better their family's station by performing great deeds and/or siring children with higher-caste dwarves, these remain rare and difficult circumstances. Lower-caste dwarves who rise in caste are generally considered \"upjumped\" by the highest castes. In dwarven society, children inherit the caste of their same-sex parent; should a son be born, he would inherit his father's caste, or his father's lack of caste, should that be the case. In spite of the fundamental conservativeness of the dwarven culture, sexuality plays an important role, largely due to the low racial birth rate. It has been suggested that the root cause of the low birth rate may be \"corruption-caused infertility\" contracted from exposure to the Deep Roads. As is common in surfacer society, nobles and other high-caste dwarves are expected to marry only within their caste. Dwarves do not often mate with other races as such contact is limited in the isolated Orzammar. And as they naturally consider themselves superior to other races, and such mingling is looked down upon in any case. Casteless females understand their value in Orzammar is solely in breeding among the castes, which gives them agency, in a fashion, as noble hunters, who seek the sexual attentions of noble males in order to advance themselves (and/or their families or 'sponsors'). Casteless males have a more difficult situation, as they can only hope to sire children with higher-caste women - most of whom are not in a position to pursue affairs with them, or are not interested in doing so. Additionally, in terms of courtship, it is noted that for a dwarven male to wear both vambraces indicates he is unmarried and eligible. The judicial functions of government are split between the king and the Shaperate. The king and his warriors deal with crime and maintain order, while the Shaperate deals with civil disputes. The Shaperate is also ultimately responsible for the preservation of all records current and historical. As a result, it is the supreme authority over the authenticity and binding nature of contracts, as well as legal precedent. The Shaper of Memories is considered a role of absolute impartiality in dwarven society, and commands enormous respect as a disinterested third-party in legal matters. In dwarven society the role of the Shaper is one of great honor, privilege, and also hardship. A Shaper must honor the Stone, protect it, and present a new history to the Memories. However, this means that a Shaper must seek out knowledge and history beyond the city and its inhabitants, venturing into the Deep Roads to record the history of lost thaigs and ruins and dwarves whom the Memories might otherwise forget. A Shaper must be prepared to risk all\u2014perhaps even their own life\u2014so that the dwarven race might reclaim its lost knowledge and learn from it. The Provings are public arena battles fought for the sake of honor and glory and to entertain the masses. They take place in the Orzammar Proving arena. Dwarves believe that a fighter who wins a Proving has the approval of the Paragons and so they use Provings to settle debates and honor challenges that could not be settled otherwise. This usually falls to warrior caste champions. Some Proving matches are fought to the death, but even in a dwindling society such as Orzammar, one death in a Proving is thought preferable to the widespread bloodshed of a conflict between noble houses. In recent years, the Provings have also been used for entertainment and events to honor special guests, and each year the best fighters in Orzammar meet for the \"Trials of Blood,\" a great tournament that crowns the kingdom's best and most popular fighter. great gladiatorial battles, lost and rejected by the Stone, hard-working ethics, cunning, smiths, stonemasons, bankers, thugs. member of expeditions. Orzammar\u2014as the ancient empire likely was before the division into city-states\u2014is a constitutional monarchy, consisting of a king and one legislative house entirely of nobles (approximately eighty of them at the time of Dragon Age: Origins). Other castes are not represented in any fashion in the Assembly. The noble houses which are allowed to have a deshyr and represented in the Assembly are those which can trace a general, deshyr or a Paragon among their ancestors. Subsequently, lesser noble houses may not have a vote in the Assembly as well as the number of deshyrs in the Assembly can easily vary. The Assembly holds the power to advise the king, approve or veto acts of the king, propose policy, declare Paragons, and elect new kings. Furthermore, the Steward of the Assembly is a non-voting member. When the king or queen die, the Assembly goes into deliberation until they choose the next monarch, by majority vote. It is traditional for the king or queen to nominate their successor, usually their eldest child, or less often, a younger child or even someone from another House. This decision carries a significant political weight during the election, however it is not enough to determine the new ruler. Fighting, blackmail, and assassination can be intense as contenders for the throne vie for power, and can last for a very long time before the succession is resolved. Dwarves, as they themselves note, are hardheaded and stubborn in their decision-making. essentially conservative, While the king may propose legislation, the Assembly has the authority to block the king's actions through dissent and deadlock, limiting the king's ability to affect domestic law or international relations. The king's primary functions are as an important figure in ceremony, and as the Commander-in-Chief. The king's greatest autonomy is in the deployment of troops in the Deep Roads and the training of warriors. It is unclear whether the king is also the de facto general of the dwarven army, though it is implied that each is a separately-held office and his role as Commander-in-Chief is mainly as a figurehead. One would be hard pressed to find a people prouder of their history and accomplishments than the dwarves of Orzammar. They have done much of great worth. Their architectural feats alone are staggering. But their greatest triumphs are also all long past, and their pride eclipses them. In fact, the dwarves' pride has contributed substantially, if not definitively, to Orzammar's current condition. There is little doubt that their embattled kingdom could stand the military aid of any surface kingdom that would be willing to provide it. The dwarves of Orzammar are not xenophobic, but neither do they believe that there is much of worth to be found beyond their stone halls. They believe dwarves to be the most formidable race of Thedas and condescend to outsiders on the unusual occasions when they interact. To their credit, most dwarves of Orzammar can be readily convinced that some particular human or elf is worthy of respect based on deeds either observed or reported, but at the same time, these dwarves also argue until the end of their breath that these individuals are unusual exceptions to the general rule. Avvar[ ] The dwarves seem to have a decent relationship with the Avvar people. Some Avvar clans have formed connections with both the dwarven kingdom of Orzammar and the Carta. This relationship extends back to the founding of the Avvar around -1815 Ancient, when Tyrdda Bright-Axe gave a promise of peace and established trade with the dwarves. Tyrdda had a child with the dwarf-prince Hendir - a child who then succeeded Tyrdda as leader of the Avvar tribe. In ancient times, an Avvar clan settled in the caves on the Waking Sea coast, where they met a group of dwarves. The dwarves protected a member of the clan when she fled to the Deep Roads, and later helped the Avvar defeat and bind a dangerous shade called the Dark Theurge. The Avvar clan built the Fort of a Thousand Vigils over the cave system and continued having a peaceful relationship with the local dwarves. The dwarves were trading with the Avvar people in secret, possibly to due the region being a subject of the Tevinter conquest campaign. The Avvars trade furs, goat milk, and free passage rights for dwarf traders (allowing them to travel over the Frostbacks in peace) in exchange for arms and armor. The dwarves regard the Avvars as a useful deterrent against both Fereldan and Orlesian ambitions. War breeds fear and a desire for simplicity. Slowly elven generals became respected elders, then kings, and finally claimed divinity and were recognized as gods, the Evanuris. They declared the Earth their right and exiled spirits they proclaimed the Forbidden Ones for abandoning the People in their time of need and casting aside form to flee to where the Earth could not reach. Elven gods used orbs, or foci, to harness magical power. Powerful magic allowed the Evanuris to enslave tens of thousands of their kin who were branded with the symbols of the gods, the vallaslin. The Evanuris restricted others from assuming some winged forms by labeling it sacrilege and took it upon themselves to dispense justice. Few, forgotten, refused those who would exert will upon them and lurked in the Void, preparing to strike. Golden Age[ ] \"We were everyone. There were no humans, no dwarves, no race but the elves.\" The Evanuris built temples and lured the faithful with promises. These were no simple shrines but cities with buildings radiating out of the main edifice, with dedicated temple guards and a multitude of functionaries who conducted rituals, ablutions, and prayers overseen by High Keepers. At least some of them would shed their names the day they began their service and would pass their memories on through an artificial \"well\" at the end of their days. High priests who drank from the well gained collective knowledge of all priests before them, but became bound forever to the will of a particular deity, compelled to act as commanded. Elvhen also used veilfire to convey sights, sounds, and even emotions. Mythal was the only voice of reason who genuinely cared for her people. Thus, when Andruil went hunting in the Void, grew mad and brought \"plague\" to her lands, Mythal challenged the hunter and stole her knowledge of how to find the Void, and peace returned. An aeon passed since the defeat of the titans, when the Evanuris in their greed discovered something terrible deep underground. In fear, elves sealed the tunnels with stone and magic and vowed to forget the place. At long last, the realization that false gods would destroy all sparked a rebellion. The rebellion[ ] \"There are no gods.

Daedric masks styled in tribute to various revered figures, such as the Daedric Faces of Inspiration (Boethiah), Terror (Nerevar), and God (Vivec). Daedric equipment is typically only seen in the hands of the upper class, where they are passed on through generations of kin, volcanic glass. Ebony weapons are made from a rare form of volcanic glass. \"Ebony\" refers to the glassy black surface of the weapons, glass armor forged from malachite for lightweight weapons and armor, and ebony for heavier fare. Glass is prized for its sharpness and delicate balance in weapons, as well as its durability and the ease of maneuverability it provides for armor, bows that are laminated in bone-shell and resin. When in need of medium armor; relies on bonemold, tanto, shortswords, glass, ebony, and Daedric longswords are precious heirlooms passed down through generations of noble warriors. Dwemer and Daedric maces are also prized as family heirlooms.

The \"peaceful\" status quo was considered quite 'savage' by others. Political machinations are constant. Assassinations are common. A huge amount of black market activity thrives, religious iconography has made use of the triangle and the pyramid. Three is a lucky number. Some objects are designed to do things in threes, such as muffin pans that bake only three muffins. Ancestor worship, believe the spirits of the dead live on in the mortal realm. The spirits know and can affect the future, speak with other spirits, and perform great feats of magic, honor their deceased ancestors, giving them gifts and petitioning them for aid and protection. Recently deceased spirits are the quickest to guide and protect their kin when called upon. The spirits of heroes and wise women are strong, pass down these ancestors' stories so they don't forget their wisdom, ask their kinder ancestors to protect them from malevolent spirits. The Daedra are the oldest and greatest of the ancestor spirits. Though powerful, they are dangerous and difficult to understand, family shrine in her home to venerate her ancestors, hearth or alcove where family relics are displayed, set aside an entire room for their ancestors to use.

The Altmer are the most strongly gifted in the arcane arts of all the races, and they are very resistant to diseases and immune to parlysis. However, they are also somewhat vulnerable to magicka, fire, frost, and shock, which makes them very weak against their strongest point - magic. They are among the longest living and most intelligent races of Tamriel, and they often become powerful magic users due to both their magical affinity and the many years they may devote to their studies. As a last straw, the Evanuris murdered Mythal. Solas was unable to kill them, so he created the Veil to banish them forever. The act was referred to as \"holding back the sky\" and was performed in Skyhold, Solas' own castle. The results were catastrophic. The Veil blocked most people's conscious connection to the Fade and caused elvhen to begin aging. Places like Vir Dirthara that were intrinsically tied to the Fade collapsed in on themselves, and paths between them crumbled, destroying eons of knowledge, killing many elvhen and even fracturing spirits. Solas himself was greatly weakened and fell into a centuries-long slumber. interacted and traded peaceably. Ancient underground ruins, a place of serenity, where the elders came to slumber and were visited by those who offered tribute to the gods on their behalf, Violence escalated over the next few decades, until in the summer of -998 Ancient several human settlements vanished into the forest. In retaliation in -981 Ancient, in the reign of Archon Thalasian, imperial legions laid siege to the city of Arlathan. It lasted for six years and consumed significant resources of the attackers, leaving them vulnerable to an uprising of rival Inghirsh tribes to the south. Finally in -975 Ancient, pressed to swiftly end the war, Tevinter magisters resorted to blood magic. Together they worked a spell that sank Arlathan into the ground, destroying collected knowledge, culture, and art. However, in the light of previous elven history it was no more than \"carrion feasting upon a corpse.\" In the Dales, the elves created a second elven homeland and began to restore the lost lore and culture of Elvhenan, including the worship of their elven gods. They built their first city, Halamshiral (\"end of the journey\" in the elven language), and isolated themselves from the humans. Their borders were guarded by an order named the Emerald Knights. For some years, humans loyal to Andraste's memory respected their elven allies. But over the generations, as Emperor Drakon launched military campaigns to spread the worship of the Maker and established the Orlesian Empire and the Chantry, diplomatic relations between the Dales and humans soured. The elves, who refused to convert, became increasingly isolationist as the Chantry sent missionaries and templars to their lands. Relations further deteriorated when the Dalish refused to lend aid during the Second Blight. When elven forces attacked the human town of Red Crossing in 2:09 Glory, border skirmishes between Orlais and the Dales turned to open war. As the elves captured Montsimmard and marched on Val Royeaux, Divine Renata I called an Exalted March against the elves. Having been heavily discriminated by humans for so long, most city elves try to hold onto their remaining heritage. Artifacts from Arlathan like the vhenadahl (literally, \"The Tree of the People\") and an abiding deep pride in their close-knit communities bolster city elves trying to make ends meet in an otherwise hostile world. As such, elves that leave the alienage and try to enter human society are heavily looked down upon as \"flat ears\". Families that do try to leave alienages and live among humans will most likely be forced to return because of violence against them. Marriage is highly important for city elves; it is the rite of adulthood in elven communities and will often be prearranged in order for new blood to join an otherwise concentrated gene pool. The absolute worst thing an elf could do is marry or breed outside their race since only humans are born between elven and human unions; which is adverse for such limited communities that depends on each other and tradition for day-to-day survival. seek to recover, inherit and preserve knowledge and sacred treasures. They lead nomadic lives as a means of survival, wandering throughout, wary and apprehensive of outsiders. The elven language, or Elvish, was largely lost when Elvhenan fell to civil war and its people eventually defeated and enslaved. When the elves settled their second homeland, the Dales, they aimed to restore their lost language and lore, but the Dales fell to an Exalted March. The Elvish of the Dragon Age is thus a fragmented remnant, a few words that are thrown into conversation rather than a working language used to conduct everyday life. The Dalish Elves, self-appointed custodians of the elven language and lore, use more Elvish than their City Elf brethren. Living among humans, the City Elves now retain only a few old Elvish words whose origin is almost forgotten, such as shem\u2014derived from shemlen, the old Elvish term for humans meaning \"quickling\" or \"quick children,\"\u2014and hahren\u2014the leader of an Alienage, meaning \"elder\" in Elvish. Arena Trainers are in charge of training Avvar warriors. They \"prepare warriors for the gods\", as the Avvar sometimes call for the spirits' help in battle. It is the Arena Trainers' duty to train the warriors well so that they can receive the gods' gifts, like additional strength or better situational awareness in a moment of need. Arena Trainers oversee the trials that take place in the hold's arena, known as Hakkon's trials. This is a fight against the best warriors in the hold, until one of the sides surrenders. Before entering the trial, participants have to deliver an offering to the Arena Trainer. In some Avvar holds, including Stone-Bear Hold, a person is identified by a firstname and a surname, and the surname is determined by the firstname of a parent, with the suffix \"-sen\" (meaning \"son\") or \"-dotten\" (meaning \"daughter\") added to the parent's name. For example, Finn Caldansen is the son of Caldan; and Fullna Hethsdotten is the daughter of Heth. As such, the Avvar do not use typical family names, the surnames change from generation to generation. For one to continue using their parent's name as a surname after the death of said parent, the individual must complete the traditional funerery rites, which includes giving a sufficient offering in honour of the deceased. If they fail to perform these rites, they no longer introduce themselves as a son or daughter of their parent, and the family relation stops being recognized by the rest of the hold. An Avvar can also earn a \"legend-mark\" by accomplishing a significant feat. A legend-mark is a cognomen that replaces the surname, usually in honor of a great deed performed by the individual; e.g., Ivatt Jovsen was made Ivatt Stone-Thunder in recognition of protecting his hold, though it can also signify someone's negative traits, as in the case of Rekkas Feather-Fall. For some clans, there are three parts to an Avvar name. These are the first name, the byname and the clan name. These clans tend to be matrilineal, so the byname is used to show who an Avvar's mother is. \"An\" would indicate \"daughter of\" and indicate \"son of\". The byname is followed \"O\" and then the name of the clan. For example, Arcill Ar Dubne O Wyrmhold would be the son of Dubne from the clan Wyrmhold. For other clans, there are two parts to an Avvar name. These are the first name and the byname. Bynames indicate the parent of the same gender as the child with \"sen\" for son of or \"dotten\" for daughter. The Avvar do not marry for life, instead, they practice temporary marriages. During the wedding ceremony, the bride will sing a hymn to the Lady of the Skies while the groom attempts to undo a series of knots she has tied in a long rope. The number of knots the groom undoes before the hymn ends determines the number of years that marriage will last. Both the bride and the groom may try to affect the result of the ritual, for example, the bride can tie the knots very tightly, while the groom can decide to only untie a certain number of the knots before the hymn ends. The ceremony can be repeated multiple times to extend the duration of the marriage. Once permission has been given, a warrior is expected to prove his skill by slipping into the hold and removing his new bride. A warrior who is caught on his first try can expect a severe beating, but nothing worse. If he is caught again on the second try, though, he is likely to become lunch for the clan's sacred animal. Avvarian men may approach a lady directly if they wish to secure her agreement (or assistance), and some Avvar women make it known that they desire a specific man. The Avvar people subsist on whatever the Frostback Moutains provide. They welcome any kind of meat, from snails, harts, and rams to larger creatures such as lurkers and gurguts. Although wyverns are dangerous to hunt due to their venom, and their flesh is poisonous, the Avvar consider them a good source of food. The Avvar often hunt in the forest and set up traps. The Avvar people also engage in animal husbandry, as they keep chickens and goats in pens. Avvar cooking methods favor utility. Communal evening meals are prepared by both men and women and taken around the fire. Stews are a typical meal, as they can be easily prepared. Baked fish wrapped in clay and pungent leaves is a popular dish for holds settled near lakes or rivers. Most Avvar food preparation centers around winter: from the spring thaw onward, meat is smoked, vegetables pickled, fruits dried, everything stored in anticipation of the long, cold winter of the Frostbacks. Despite the importance of food storage, the Avvar have no qualms about leaving significant amount of food as offering to their gods. Each hold has a \"hold-beast\" that ties the clan to the gods. This animal acts as a sort of revered mascot and is treated as kin to the clan. It is no pet and is granted independence to live as it chooses. It's free to come visit the clan whenever it wishes. The clan members may even offer it gifts of food, though not enough that it would not hunt for itself. It is said that a hold draws strength from its hold-beast. When a hold-beast is strong and happy, there is joy. When it sickens and dies, it is an ill omen. If a hold-beast is sick or missing, it's a sign to other clans that the whole hold is weak, so the Avvar may want to conceal this information. A hold-beast is expected to fight in protection of its hold. The Avvar believe without question that their gods have protected them and kept them strong, for do they not thrive despite their numerous enemies? Wise lowlanders avoid pointing out that the hillsmen have been pushed into some of the most inhospitable terrain in all of Thedas. In truth, the Avvar love the Frostbacks and would only take offense at the thought that they were \"forced\" into the mountains. The Avvar have a complex pantheon, which includes both nature spirits and legendary mortals who have ascended to the heavens. This is further complicated by the fact that the pantheon varies somewhat from hold to hold, as every clan has its own sacred tales and heroes; however, all Avvars agree on the three greatest gods, Korth the Mountain-Father, Hakkon Wintersbreath, and the Lady of the Skies. The Avvar deem spirits as their gods, treating them as patrons to be lulled and wooed. The Avvar deliberately invoke spirits for strength in battle or solicit them for advice. Such spirits have lived within their holds for many generations, and sometimes took the form of an animal or departed relatives when they pass on their wisdom. In the event a god is destroyed, the Avvar begin a year-long time of offerings and prayers and rituals. At the end of this period, a new spirit takes on the name and role of the old one. The Avvar believe in an afterlife governed by the Lady of the Skies where the dead are reunited with their kin. The Avvar also believe some of their people are destined to be reborn, i.e., the essence (the soul) returns clothed in new flesh. The core of the concept is thus: the souls of a few Avvar \"favored\" by fate \"migrate\" on death to inhabit new bodies destined for them, so they may return and perform great deeds for the good of their hold. These resurrected souls are not expected to remember their past selves consciously, but instead are assumed to be subtly \"guided\" by their previous experiences, especially through visions and portents. The trickster of the Avvar pantheon, Imhar is a slight man who must rely on his quick tongue instead of strength. Avvars enjoy tales of Imhar's jests and mockery, perhaps the most popular of which is that of Imhar and an evil seductress. She lured him into facing her unarmed, then faced him with an army of demons. Playing the coward, Imhar led them on a merry chase through a mountain pass. When they thought they had cornered him, Imhar laughed out loud. The great noise shook the peaks, and the horde was crushed beneath the avalanche he caused. The Great Bear sleeps at the foot of the Mountain Father's throne, and is so vast in size that Korth once confused him with a small mountain. Sitting at Korth's foot, he is also the guardian of wisdom. Avvars may challenge him to acquire knowledge, but the bones of many on such a quest are strewn about his den. The augurs allow their apprentices to be possessed by a summoned Spirit and the spirit teaches the mage how to control their magic with patience and kindness. When the teaching is done, the mage must then release the spirit through a ritual that involves burning an offering and casting a taxing spell that usually requires a vial of lyrium to replenish one's strength. Weak mages unable to control their magic remain possessed and the Avvar' spirit gods watch them both so neither soul becomes corrupted. If the abomination becomes corrupted or the mage stands at risk of harming the hold, then one day the abomination is killed in their sleep. When forced to consider complex spiritual matters, the Avvar turn to their shamans, the lore keepers of the mountains. It is they who watch the migrations of birds seeking wisdom from the Lady, they who keep the old songs and retain the knowledge of the proper rites to honor the gods and spirits of the mountains. The majority of Avvar shamans are powerful mages whose traditions stretch far back beyond the foundations of the Circle of Magi. Each Avvar clan is led by a thane. Avvar settle disputes that don't have a clear right party by undergoing tests and trials. Usually these tests are dedicated to their spirit gods: for example, the \"Test of the Lady\" is a race to climb a rock face between two competitors, each of which represent a party or claim in the dispute. The Avvar have many of these trials and the procedures for each one varies. Thanes guide the gods in deciding who is worthy and decide which test will settle the dispute. Thanes also have the power to ask a warrior whose claim is foolish to bear a handicap in the test, such as to climb the Test of the Lady with stones strapped to their back. The test and conditions of the test regarding a dispute between two clans or more are assumed to be negotiated and coordinated by the thanes of the invested clans. Peace is maintained between clans by creating alliances and officiating them with oaths. Some clans swear to defend and avenge each other. Admittedly, not all Avvar hold these oaths sacred, especially for clans who promise such oaths but bear little fondness to those they are sworn to. The realistic truth is that oaths last until they are broken. A cunning thane can find a loophole and should the oath-breakers emerge victorious through cunning, they can appease the other clans sworn to defend and avenge those they've transgressed against by sending offerings, trade and gifts, to pay the price of oath-breaking. incredibly smart, clever, and determined, will go towards any extent to achieve her goals as seen by her extreme determination to stop the person behind the TVA. Like other Loki Variants, she deeply cares about her mother shown by how she was deeply moved through Loki's stories with his mother. Also, like Loki Variants, she is shown to be a narcissistic person who cares about themselves more than others as seen how she shunned others to the side for her goals. However, unlike her other Variants she is far more aggressive with her approach towards handling people, she hates her identity as a \"Loki\", and her extremely stubborn persona. Further, she also has a greater level of intelligence in comparison to other Loki Variants, as seen by how she discovered people could hide in apocalypses and be defended from the TVA. Due to her life growing up across apocalypses, she's incredibly distrusting and almost always assumes the worst. He Who Remains even points this out, asking her if she thinks she's even capable of trusting others, due to all the childhood trauma she experienced. This was shown when she couldn't sit with her back behind the door and had difficulty working with Loki initially. He is also very protective of his Sony Walkman that was given to him by his mother. This was shown numerous times when he attempted to assault a prison guard who took it, and when during the prison break when Quill made his way back into the prison just to retrieve the device. Later, Quill's anger for his father was more focused due to Ego breaking the Walkman despite the confession that Ego had also murdered his mother. Being a memento of his mother, it's quite understandable why Quill was so protective and possessive of his Walkman. Before joining the Guardians, Quill lived in the ways of an average criminal and thug, going so far as killing Sakaarans and attempting to kill Korath himself when they seemingly threatened his well-being as they were arresting him for interrogation by Ronan. Although, he only attacked them when he was aware that he could get the drop on them and win, as well as when he knew that he could not convince them to let him go. However, he merely stunned and knocked out the guards on the Kyln with his Quad Blasters instead of using lethal force, which shows that he only would kill to defend himself or in battles with foes that are outside the law, such as Ronan and Korath's men. He is very conscientious of his physical weaknesses, which prevents him from acting impulsive as he is always aware of the dangers of his actions, especially in combat. Quill has shown that he can be heroic; he was unwilling to watch Gamora die in space, so he exited his pod and gave Gamora his mask, saving her life, nearly at the cost of his own. He was also the one who brought the Guardians together to save Xandar, showcasing his leadership qualities and a certain amount of charisma since all the members were well-known outlaws. While not showing it often, and despite his womanizing habits, Quill does have romantic feelings for Gamora, and even though she puts up a serious and cold demeanor towards him, she also reciprocates his feelings. This eventually changed a few years later where they both admitted their feelings for each other, with Gamora just moments before being captured by Thanos and eventually dying, confessed that she loved Peter more than anything. Peter likewise was also extremely affected after learning of her death to the point of going into an extreme rage and viciously attacking Thanos in retaliation. Due to being raised as a child by aliens, having possibly not learned just how weak humans are compared to other beings, he never suspected that he was half alien himself and assumed his inhuman resilience to be normal for any kind of creature. Furthermore, he appears out of touch with modern earthlings, as he barely associated with Tony Stark and Spider-Man because of his out of date references. However, despite this, Quill was pleased to hear that Spider-Man understood his reference to Footloose, but didn't realize that he was talking about the remake that was made years later and not the one he remembered as he was bummed to hear that it wasn't the greatest movie in history. Also, Quill seemed to enjoy being around with his fellow humans, as seen with Stark, Stephen Strange and Peter Parker. Quill's sense of humor is similar to Stark and Strange. There were many pieces of evidence of this such as when he claimed Stark's plan in attacking Thanos was good but dumb and that if he came up with the plan then it would be better. Also, Quill possessed good wisdom, as seen when he told his future teammates on Knowhere that their mistrust for others were the reasons why they didn't have any friends, and gave Thor some wise advice about experiencing various emotions, such as love, and finding his way in life before parting ways from him. After losing both his parents and sergeant father, Quill didn't have any other family but his fellow guardians. However, once he found out that Mantis is his sister, Quill was excited to hear this news and realized that she is the only family member he has left in his life, excluding his teammates. Quill has a strong love towards his family and loved ones, which drives him to protect those around him and makes him reluctant to hurt his friends. However, his emotions tend to get the best of him, as he is prone to outburst of rage and sadness when confronted by the death of a loved one. This best seen when he learned the truth behind his mother's death and when he found out Thanos killed Gamora. Likewise, Quill had a very hard time accepting his mother's death, shown by how he refused to open the last present she gave him for more than twenty years because he was told to open it after she died. He still thinks about her and has grown to dislike Earth, due to the fact that is where he left his mother and because his father told him that his mother being connected to the planet was holding him back and why she died. Indeed, he has not visited Earth in years. After returning for the first time in decades, he wanted to leave as quick as possible. Despite this, Quill still cared about Earth to some extent as he helped protect his home planet from Thanos and stayed for Stark's funeral in order to pay his respects for the fallen hero. Also, Quill still appreciated his home planets customs, such as Christmas. Rocket has an obsession with prosthetic limbs, finding it humorous to steal them - especially without the possessor knowing as shown when he asked Peter Quill to get a guy's prosthetic leg to bust them out of jail, lying about the leg to see if Quill would do it and asking him whether the guy was hopping around on one leg, laughing all the while. He later tries pulling a similar stunt with Vorker, one of the Ravagers, saying that he needed the cybernetic eye off for his plan, although he is stopped by Quill. When Groot actually did steal the eye, Rocket burst out laughing into tears. In the Battle of Wakanda, after being assisted by the Winter Soldier in killing a horde of Outriders, he inquired if he can purchase his custom-made machine gun. When he declines the offer, he then offers to purchase Barnes' vibranium arm, which is also declined. He chuckles to himself as he leaves the offer to buy it on the table. He appears to pride himself on his abilities and professionalism, which is indicated by when he spoke harshly to Groot when Groot childishly drank out of a fountain then smiled about it. A true criminal, Rocket has a higher sense of self-preservation and interests than the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy. In the conflict against Thanos he volunteered himself and Groot to go with Thor to Nidavellir as opposed to going with his fellow Guardians to confront Thanos directly, and Star-Lord points this out. He will cave into pessimism and panic in a situation that is out of his depth as he was the first to consider simply giving the Infinity Stone to Ronan the Accuser after realizing its destructive purposes and instead of fighting the Accuser after coming into the possession of the Stone, planned to run away to \"the furthest corners of the galaxy\" with Groot. She has a distorted view of the logical and ethical boundaries of the law as she believes if he wants a possession more than the current possessor of such an item, it was acceptable to steal it from them. Deep down she is incredibly lonely and carries overwhelming pain, covers her insecurities well, becomes very emotional and even more violent when drunk. Lonely and pain, despises being derided, thinks she is a monster. brusque and macho exterior. initially maintained a black-and-white outlook on life, distrusting nature and tendency to be insensitively straightforward. had very little patience, and did not put up well with anything that would hold her back. off-putting front, showed remarkable loyalty towards those in her inner circle and took up responsibility to protect them. became increasingly self-destructive, very tightly wound and believed that if she ever let himself relax, another innocent person would die. issue with authority figures and often preferred doing things her own way, but this lessened over time, very stubborn, liked to give the impression of a gruff loner, valued her friendships and showed a sensitive side in her relationships. plagued with insecurities regarding her role in the team, and began to resent being considered \"the muscle\". shaved her head and dressed casually, usually in hooded coats, sleek, professional suits of a legal powerhouse. purpose as a soldier in the fight against evil. a fan of Denzel Washington and hadn't bothered to see a movie since the actor was robbed at the Oscars for Malcom X. had strength and street fighting expertise, often being described as \"the muscle\". He was an expert at using weapons, large battle axe made from a hubcap. talented and intelligent investigator, a fan of pop culture and often displayed a detailed knowledge regarding comic books. had knowledge of all legal codes, knowledge of golf techniques and knows all Gilbert & Sullivan light operas. Despite Rocket's apparent dislike of people, he is exceedingly attached to Groot, and is the first known individual who was able to understand Groot when he spoke, even while everyone else only heard 'I am Groot.' He is obviously exceedingly attached to Groot, as seen when he started crying when Groot was apparently killed and pleading with Groot to not save them because he knew that Groot would die if he did so. His grief over Groot's apparent death lead him to angrily charge at Ronan, who was armed with his Cosmi-Rod and the Power Stone, while completely unarmed. It was also in this moment of vulnerability that he was comforted by Drax the Destroyer, which he initially flinched at before accepting the caring gesture, showing that he was not used to such gentleness or kindness. He also became very protective of Groot's offspring, caring for him in a fatherly manner and collapsed to his knees sobbing when he was erased from existence by the Infinity Gauntlet. While captive with Yondu Udonta, Rocket quickly bonded with him due to their similar backgrounds and the fact that they love people without saying it. A great example of his newfound bond with Yondu is when he refused to leave Ego's Planet without him, even though it would mean his death since the planet was about to explode. His bond with Yondu also caused him to call the rest of the Ravagers during Udonta's funeral. While watching his funeral, Rocket stated the his previous team never abandoned him even if \"he yelled at them, and was always mean, and he stole batteries he didn't need\" clearly comparing himself to Udonta. skilled in handling, modification, and construction of equipment and high-tech weaponry.

The Ayleids, also known as the Heartland High Elves, Wild Elves. They were thin and lean with pointed ears and angular facial features.

It is accompanied by wild celebration, the wearing of masks, and naming the town fool as ruler for a day. Particularly in Antiva, Satinalia lasts for a week or more, while a week of fasting follows. This holiday is celebrated at the beginning of Umbralis. The meals in Antiva consist of ten courses, antipasti and primi being the first two. Wine and coffee play a regular part in meals, often paired with antivan dishes such as Cacio e Pepe, gnocchi,, sugar-drizzled lemon cake, and cold cuts. Common ingredients in Antiva are olives, truffles, pasta, lamb, cheese, cream, and nightshade plants such as eggplant. Other ingredients from Antiva include Antivan Pepper, Antivan cord-seed, and passion fruit. Magisters constantly compete with their fellows to rise into a higher position on the Magisterium, though they come together to put down slave rebellions, which they view as sedition. Raising one's position can be achieved through wealth, magical prowess and/or support by fellow senators but almost always requires relying on forbidden magic. There are various means by which an enterprising mage may enter this august company. For example, in a complaint made between two magisters in 9:35 Dragon regarding Maevaris Tilani's disruption of the Magisterium's traditions, one of the aggrieved magisters mentions her buying off every vulgatis and honoratus in the eastern empire. It is unknown specifically what these terms mean, though it can be assumed they hold enough power in the Imperium to sway public opinion. Furthermore, each of the seven Circles within Tevinter selects a magister for the Magisterium, and this mage is often an older Senior Enchanter but never a First Enchanter as they are not eligible for a seat. Each of the grand clerics of the Imperial Chantry and the Divine himself hold a seat as well. A mage may also inherit a seat from a magister rather than earn it through magical ability or station within the Chantry. A final means by which a mage enters the Magisterium is by being appointed directly by the Archon, which is a power the Archon may exercise at any time. do not burn their dead but instead carefully preserve the bodies and seal them in elaborate tombs. Some of the wealthiest Nevarrans start building their own tombs while still young, spending decades overseeing their construction. These become incredible palaces, with gardens, bathhouses, and ballrooms, kept only for the dead. These crypts are often decorated with their most prized possessions, and each crypt is as unique as the family buried there. The mummified body of King Caspar the Magnificent is kept in the Grand Necropolis, wearing a gold crown and sitting on a throne of gold and marble. Children of the royal family are often taken to meet him. unique relationship with magic and death. They believe that when a dead soul crosses the Fade it displaces a Fade spirit. In order to provide safe hosts for such spirits they mummify their corpses and place them in elaborate crypts in the Grand Necropolis. secretive order. Its gray-robed members enjoy wealth and political power as they often serve as advisers to Nevarran nobility Under Celene's rule, the restrictions on artistic expression imposed by the Chantry or the current ruler on theater were lifted, leading to a resurgence in popularity. The sphere of theater is a close reflection of the political climate of the country. Many a social scandal will even find itself immortalized as a play. Though theatrical works reflect central themes of Orlesian culture, such as disdain towards Fereldens and reverence for Kordilius Drakon, a few striking contrasts can also be found. In a country where The Grand Game can be a matter of life and death, a character's importance to the play and their gender is clearly defined by the appearance of their mask, an article which once donned, is understood to be absolutely them. Elves have also done well in the theaters of Orlais, and are not only allowed to hold main parts and play humans but can also socially progress upon becoming famous. Dogs are common in Ferelden, both amongst the nobles as well as the common folk and mercenaries such as the Ash Warriors. Keeping dogs is a tradition kept since the times before Ferelden, started by the Alamarri tribes. The barbarians were introduced to mabari by the magisters, who brought the dogs with them during their invasion of the land; many of the dogs decided to stay in the occupied lands after their original masters were defeated. Mabari are said to have been bred from the wolves who served the Alamarri hero Dane and anyone they are paired with are believed by Fereldans to be a person of worth. Furthermore, prominent Fereldan families think that they have a kinship with the mabari because according to Fereldan folklore, they are descendants of Dane, who was reputed to be a werewolf. In addition to that, the mabari have also become an essential part of Fereldan military strategy and a formidable asset to Fereldan armies. Fereldan law is relatively unregulated compared to that of older nations, and is expected on an individual level to be supplemented by one's martial prowess. the common Fereldan should not expect much help fending off criminal activity unless murder or major property damage has occurred. Magic was an enormous part of their society. In accordance with High Elf religion, they believed Nirn was composed of four basic elements: earth, water, air, and light (as opposed to the four elements of modern natural philosophy: earth, water, air, and fire). Some of their magic tapped into the power of the weather. The most sublime form was starlight, as the stars were the link between Mundus and Aetherius. They used aetherial fragments which fell from the heavens, particularly meteoric iron, to construct receptacles which are believed to harness energy from starlight. These \"Ayleid Wells\" are scattered all over Cyrodiil, and can still be used by mages to replenish their energy. The logic used in their placement is a mystery, and none are known to be associated with any particular Ayleid settlements. They kept specially cut pieces of meteoric glass known as Welkynd Stones (meaning literally \"sky children\") as storage containers for magical energy, as well what are called Varla Stones (or \"star stones\"). This was still an emerging technology when the Alessian Slave Rebellion brought about the decline and disappearance of their society. Some of these crystals had the capacity to store and release memories directly to the reader; overuse of these crystals can cause a 'problem of capacity' for mortals. Varla gems were occasionally used to imbue the diadems by Barsaebic for that purpose. These underground cities can prove deadly for adventurers, hiding such dangers as traps, monsters, undead, and criminals. Their cities were amazing feats of architecture ranging from small settlements to gigantic, labyrinth-like metropolises shaped out of whitish rock. They also seem to have had a firm grasp of the magical arts, as many of their ruins contain stones filled with magicka essences harvested from the sky. They also developed what came to be called the school of Alteration, as they were skilled in magics such as shapeshifting and levitation. They preserved many of the ancient runes and Dawn Era magics of the Ehlnofey that other elves had forgotten. The prophecies of the moth-eyed foretold that Ayleidic hubris would \"bear bitter fruit\", a warning that many, apparently, failed to heed. It would be their undoing. venerated Magnus, the god of magic and the Aedra's absent comrade. Scholars have also concluded, though, that the Daedric Prince Meridia, who they knew as Merid-Nunda, represented for them the personification of the most-sacred element of light. Ayleids venerated their ancestors, and Aedra is an Elven word for \"ancestor\". - Absence - a type of absinthe created by distiller Emeritus Gaivon, who states \"I am aware of how to spell it.

Elfroot[ []] Elfroot, an herb primarily used medicinally in healing salves and potions, is analogous to the real-world cannabis plant. Its alternative name \"canavaris\" sounds remarkably similar, and the \"medicinal qualities\" of elfroot were rediscovered by herbalists in 4:20 Black, a fact mentioned by developer Patrick Weekes when asked whether cannabis exists in Thedas. 420 is a number used to refer to the practice of consuming marijuana. A book in the Apprentice Quarters titled \"This is Your Brain on Elfroot\" is a parody of the U.S. based This Is Your Brain on Drugs anti-drug campaign launched in 1987, famously known for using a frying egg as a metaphor for drug use in one TV public service announcement. - Blood Lotus - the blossoms release a hallucinogenic essence into the air. Comtesse d'Arnee's summer garden party featured four hundred and twenty blood lotus flowers (note the number being 420), leaving many of the guests asleep and one lady without several teeth after being convinced a marble statue was made out of cake. - \"She's like this cleavage-y slut-bomb walking around 'Ooh, check me out, I'm wicked-cool River displays some ill-defined telepathic perception; she \"sees\" and foretells the future (though she often conveys her visions in a twisted, nursery-rhyme manner), she can \"feel\" people's emotions and sense their thoughts. At the end of \"Trash\", she threatens Jayne by very casually remarking \"I can kill you with my brain\", but it is unknown whether this was an empty threat or not (however, given River's psychological ability and her not having the habit of making empty threats, this is most likely true). She claims (at the end of the movie Serenity) to know what Mal is about to say and apparently reads the mind of Jubal Early (in \"Objects in Space\"). She exhibits a heightened ability to detect her surroundings, locating the bodies of the slaughtered crew in \"Bushwhacked\", finding her way around an otherwise unknown hospital without guidance in \"Ariel\", and detecting injuries or other physical problems, such as Shepherd Book being shot in \"Safe\" and a dying patient in \"Ariel.\" This ability was put to use by the Serenity crew, as she could point out incoming dangers, specifically if people where going to attack them. The full extent of her psychic/intellectual powers are unknown, as are the intentions of the shadowy organization who experimented on her, or even the true relationship that organization has to the Alliance. Despite her frail appearance and petite stature, River's skill at hand-to-hand combat is virtually unstoppable. On two separate occasions she ventures into large melees, both occasions with 20-30 opponents against her at the same time, and the latest occasion had her fighting armed Reavers, all of which she killed. On both occasions she emerges not only victorious but (apparently) completely uninjured. The fighting style used by River in Serenity was a kung fu/kickboxing hybrid, modified to be more \"balletic.\" She was very proficient with combat, whether unarmed, armed melee and armed at-range. Her skill with firearms is also shown to be near super-human: during a battle in the Firefly episode \"War Stories\" she memorizes the battlefield in one quick glance, then proceeds to take out three advancing soldiers with one shot each with her eyes closed and her head facing away from the men. She only needed to point the gun in their general direction to and then move it after shooting once to kill all three. immune to aging, matured and stabilized, developed a more well-rounded fighting style. remains in the wilds, rarely seen. statues depict an eagle lifting up a figure carrying a bow and shield from the ensnaring ground. There are no laws regulating personal behavior such as bearing arms, drinking, gambling and prostitution. This is not to say that Ferelden is lawless; quite the opposite. The king's seneschal personally appoints arbiters\u2014judges\u2014called \"blackhallers\" to hear disputes. Blackhallers adjudicate cases from the black granite seneschal's hall in Denerim\u2014hence the name\u2014, and in the countryside, sheriffs appointed by the local bann patrol and keep track of upcoming cases for the blackhallers to hear. Given the blackhallers' busy schedules, trials can take some time to occur. A suspect may surrender an item of great value to the local sheriff and be released \"on his bond\" until the time of the trial rather than waiting in a dungeon. This property will be returned if the suspect returns to be judged. Otherwise, the property is retained by the sheriff and the suspect has the charge of fleeing justice added to their criminal record. originated from the ancient people, abandoned civilization in favor of living in the wilds, and believe that they are nature itself: the forest, the plants and beasts within it, and even the weather. In contrast, while ancient druids revered nature, they were not keen to isolate themselves and worship the untamed wilds. The druids accepted what they interpreted as their \"proper place\" as people, and embraced the idea that civilization can coexist alongside nature. face persecution, dangerous and a force to be placated, reclusiveness, the nature of their moral codes, and the lack of men to replenish their ranks. witches and medicine men are held in high regard by the superstitious country-folk because of their impressive magical feats. gather around megaliths, dwell in stone huts. Druids (also known as vinebeards) are children of the land whose kind have their origins in ancient High Rock. They are practitioners of Y'ffre's True Way (also known as Druidism), in which one is to lead a life connecting with, valuing, and stewarding the growth of the natural world referred to as the Green. The eponymous god takes the forefront of their faith, with some reverence also being shown to the stars. The True Way is a promise made to the \"groves, to the seas, to the sky\", and under the Oak's Promise, druids are to \"stand strong, stay true, and shelter all\". Druids serve in accordance to Y'ffre's will in roles such as priests, arbiters, teachers, healers, and soothsayers. Druids have little interest in the quarrels of monarchies, often leading many to believe that they are pacifists. However, as champions of nature, they are not afraid to defend their ancient sites from the cruelty of civilization, as violence and death are natural. Y'ffre and his Earthbones sacrificed themselves during the Dawn Era to create the Green, an act which bound Nirn to the laws of nature. Their voices are sought by druids so they may best be their advocate, and to ensure a life guided by natural principles and the willfulness of nature. Druidic spellcraft (which differs from the arcane) is said to be the first truly Breton creation, and its practitioners utilize the wellspring of primordial energy the Earthbones left behind, which flows via lines through the ground. Junctions where this resource intersects are known as \"bonelines\", places where druidic spells exhibit strange properties, and where prayers carry deeper emphasis. It can be harnessed by druids to overcome their physical limitations, shapeshift into various animals, terraform the environment around them, or even invoke natural disasters to consume their foes. Druids are also known animists who can call upon nature spirits to aid them. Druids are defined by many dichotomies, and prime among these is their acknowledgement of their Breton heritage of hailing from both Men and Mer. The first vinebeards are referred to as the Druids of Galen by retroactive nomenclature, and they were the Nedes of High Rock (or proto-Bretons) that intermingled with the Aldmer (primarily Clan Direnni) for centuries during the Merethic Era. From this union, the Bretons (then called \"Manmer\" and \"Half-Elves\") were conceived as unwanted half-breeds, rejected by their Direnni parents that considered them sub-Mer. The Druids of Galen led this newly emerged race, and Manmer were elevated in Nedic society, where they thrived. Although the term Manmer is archaic, modern druids embrace it. Bretons have a natural affinity for environmental manipulation, which druids believe should be utilized to enhance or perfect nature, reshaping it just as Y'ffre once did. Druids as a distinct identity emerged shortly after the Breton race first came into existence. This was further warranted when the Wyrd diverged from the True Way in a religious schism, ultimately driven away by what they called the \"excesses of the Elves\". In druidic belief, Bretons (and others) were not meant to separate themselves from nature, as one can rejuvenate and enjoy Y'ffre's bounty through it. While ancient druids revered nature, they were not keen to isolate themselves and worship the untamed wilds. Therein lies the primary difference in culture between druids and the Wyrd: the Wyrd abandoned civilization in favor of living in the wilds, and believe that they are nature itself: the forest, the plants and beasts within it, and even the weather. In contrast, the druids accepted what they interpreted as their \"proper place\" as people, and embraced the idea that civilization can coexist alongside nature. The Druids of Galen and the Wyrd disapproved of each other's lifestyles: the druids found the ways of the Wyrd unsavory, and the Wyrd thought the druids as \"barons in ivy robes\" that were no better than city-dwellers. Druidom would much later practice self-isolation to varying degrees, as a response to the historical encroachments and heartless deprivations that would await them. The Druids of Galen wanted self-governance without the Direnni's interference, as well as freedom from the religious persecution such as that from the Alessian Order, but ultimately, they were driven into exile to the Systres. The Druids of Galen were a united entity led by a line of ancient kings, and they were already Bretons themselves by the time the last Druid King led them on their exodus to find a new home. When they arrived on the Systres, they disbanded and reorganized themselves into fellowships referred to as druidic circles. Each circle interprets Y'ffre's will differently, while druids within the same fellowship share the same traditions and objectives. Xenophobia among the druidic circles varies in the modern day, with the Stonelore being welcoming and taking willing converts, and the Eldertide and Firesong being hostile. Druids in turn are treated as convenient scapegoats, and some devotees of the Divines may trivialize their religion as some woodland cult. The True Way differs from the Bosmer's Green Pact, a bargain Y'ffre struck with the Bosmer. Wood Elves have many restrictions that druids do not have, such as them not being allowed to eat plant life, and not being allowed to shapeshift except through the ritual known as the Wild Hunt. In return for following the Green Pact, Bosmer can invoke the Wild Hunt in dire times, which irreversibly transforms the participants into a horde of feral and all-consuming eldritch beasts, which go on to lay waste to the enemies of the Bosmer, and then itself. Certain aspects of the True Way share similarities with the religious practices of the Reachmen, but they differ in implementation. Reachfolk are known to build relationships with spirits big and small, but they lean more on negotiation rather than on reverence. They also primarily worship the Daedric Princes as the \"Great Spirits\", and their nature magic comes from sources such as Hagravens, Orcs, or the Daedric Princes.
