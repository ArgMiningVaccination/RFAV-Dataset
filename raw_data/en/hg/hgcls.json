The practice of classical Chinese medicine incorporates ancient Chinese philosophy and teachings. Fundamental components are the use of acupuncture, Chinese herbs, and other treatment modalities that provide a complete therapeutic system. The end goal is to prevent disease and imbalance in the patient by helping to establish mental, physical and spiritual well-being. Chinese medical practitioners use classical methods of physical examination, including taking physical pulses and palpations, to find the patterns in the body that correlate to ill health. The goal of classical Chinese medicine is to bring the body back into dynamic wholeness with the natural environment by using minimally invasive techniques. Classical Chinese medicine is used worldwide for everything ranging from the common cold to pain to severe and recalcitrant disease. Other modalities employed in Chinese medicine include: - Moxibustion and heat therapy - Cupping - Scraping or \"coining\" - Movement therapy like qigong and tuina - Massage - Meditation "}
