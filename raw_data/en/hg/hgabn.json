As mandated by section 26- 9(o) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes, DCCA describes the use of the Compliance Resolution F und (CRF) by presenting individual overviews of the functions and activities of the various DCCA programs funded by the CRF, and provides a financial summary of the expenditures made from the fund including personnel and operating expenses, as well as reve nues received. In addition, the report addresses the department's compliance with the reporting requirements contained in Act 100 (1999) regarding the statement of goals, objectives and policies. The CRF, in existence since July 1, 1996, evolved into the primary funding source for the various DCCA programs as the department moved its operations away from support by general tax revenues to funding by fees and charges generated by its various programs. Pursuant to section 26- 9(o), Hawaii Revised Statutes, fees shall be assessed and deposited into the CRF for the issuance of a license, permit, certificate, or registration, subsequent renewals, together with all other fines, income, and penalties collected or reimbursement of costs or attorneys' fees assessed as a result of actions brought by the department. The director may use the moneys in the fund to employ and train hearings officers, investigators, attorneys, accountants, and other necessary personnel for CRF funded operations, and the fund shall defra y all other administrative costs, including costs of operating the supporting offices of DCCA. Any other activity related to compliance resolution may also be funded by the CRF. \"Compliance resolution\" means a determination of whether: (1) Any licensee or applicant under any chapter subject to the jurisdiction of the department of commerce and consumer affairs has complied with the requirements of said chapter; (2) Any person subject to chapters 485, 467B, 514E, and section 485- 6(15), Hawaii Revised Statutes has complied with the applicable requirements; or (3) Any person has complied with the prohibitions against unfair and deceptive acts or practices in trade or commerce. By Fiscal Year 1998 -1999, five DCCA programs were part of the CRF: Business Reg istration Division, Professional and Vocational Licensing Division, Regulated Industries Complaint Office, Office of Consumer Protection, and the Director's Office with its supporting offices of Administrative Services, Information Systems and Communicatio ns (ISCO) , and Administrative Hearings . 1 1 The Director's Office provides general policy and administrative leadership in supervising and coordinating the various department activities. Personnel management services are provided by the Director's Office, while Administrative Services provides programs with centralized budgeting, accounting, as well as centralized clerical services. Informat ion Systems and Communications provides system and technical computer support services for the various DCCA programs. Administrative Hearings conducts formal administrative hearings for the department programs and various attached boards and commissions, administers the Medical Claims and the Design Professional Conciliation Panels, hears appeals of the State procurement code, and conducts due process hearings for DOE under the Individuals with Disability Education Act (IDEA). Act 129 SLH 1999, effective July 1, 1999, expanded the CRF to include the Division of Consumer Advocacy, Division of Financial Institutions, and the Cable Television Division. Act 39, SLH 2002, effective July 1, 2002 merged the Insurance Regulation Fund, the primary funding source for the Insurance Division, into the CRF. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report - 2 - Except for trust and special funds with dedicated purposes2 Functional Area , the CRF provides the sole source of funding for DCCA since calendar year end 2003.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS The overall CRF financial summary for FY 10 3 Personnel Expenses is as follows: Operating Expenses Total Expenses Revenues Received $23,754,435 $7,894,604 $31,649,039 $35,194,643 The department's financial strategy requires generally that revenue -generating divisions secure revenues to cover divis ion expenses, and contribute equitably to overhead costs, w hile ensuring that anticipated major improvements are addressed and a portion of next year's operating expenses is available. This ensures solvency of the fund and continuation of mandatory servic es to the public. From the onset of the CRF, the department's primary fiscal goal has been to implement this strategy and , as a result, we have been very conservative in our spending and reduced expenses by the elimination of offices. 4 In the Information Technology (IT), area there were six major accomplishments this year: 1) the upgrade of the DC CA web site for faster performance; 2) the implementation of the Model Registered Agents Act (Act 55, SLH 2009) for Business Registration (BREG) ; 3) implementation of a new BREG filing for Publicity Rights (Act 28, First Special SLH 2009); 4) the addition of BREG's Name Changes and Assignments as on- line services; 5) the implementation of premium tax changes and fee increases (Act 22 Accordingly, the d epartment's financial planning has taken into account current fiscal year expenses, and planning for future major projects and expenditures. 3 The CRF financial summary relating to ADMIN (Director's Office, Personnel, Administrative Hearings, Fiscal and Administrative Services Offices and ISCO) for FY 09 -10 is as follows: Personnel Expenses Operating Expenses Total Expenses Revenues Received $3,271,479 $1,510,772 $4,782,251 $383,21 8 4 The Hawaii Public Broadcasting Authority (\"HPBA\") was a program of DCCA until June 30, 2000, after which (and pursuant to Act 63 SLH 1999) all licenses and assets of HPBA were transferred to the non -profit Hawaii Public Broadcasting Foundation. The Hawaii Claims Office ceased operations under chapter 674, Hawaii Revised Statutes, in the fall of 1999. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report - 4 - and 59, SLH 2010) for Insurance ; and 6) the addition of compliance tracking for legal outcomes for RICO's licensing cases. T o bring projects such as these to fruition, ISCO works collaboratively with DCCA business staff along with the State's central I.T. group (ICSD) and the State's Web Portal Manager. Although not as visible to our customers, ISCO continues to enhance its infrastructure to provide DCCA's business staff with efficient and secure computer tools to get their work done. Included in these infrastructure enhancements are: 1) the configuration of video conferencing to reduce travel expenses for DCCA , as well as tr avel time for staff and board members to and from the neighbor islands; 2) the configuration of virtual servers to reduce costs for hardware and associated electricity; 3) the configuration of virtual personal computers to reduce costs for expensive desktops and associated electricity, while also providing remote access capability for telework and in the event of a disaster; 4) the evaluation of printers to reduce paper and electricity costs; and 5) the relocation of RICO's Kona office. Projects underway a t this time include: 1) the upgrade of screen technology for DCCA's core custom business applications; 2) the creation of an on- line service to allow the registration of real estate condominium projects; 3) the update of the Insurance Division's custom application to include continuing education ethics credits; 4) adding real time updates to the Insurance Division's on- line services; 5) providing computer systems support for the Division of Financial Institutions mortgage loan o riginator program; 6) workin g with DBEDT to support their electric vehicle r ebate program ; 7) converting PVL's forms to fillable format; 8) working with the portal manager to add a notification subscription service to the State 's calendar ; 9) working with the Insurance Division's Health Branch to provide premium rate reporting; and 10) filtering RICO's legal outcomes from the Internet where the respondent has complied with their orders. CONCLUSION The department looks forward to continuing to fulfill its mission to regulate business fairly and reasonably, while protecting consumers from fraud and unfair business practices. We have adopted the motto \"Upholding fairness in the marketplace\" to remind us of our responsibilities. We will endeavor to provide our customers with the best value for their money by continuing our efforts to find more efficient ways of providing our services that are also convenient for our customers, such as making more services available online. ADMIN will continue to provide administrative support to the de partment's divisions so that they can concentrate on their respective specific substantive responsibilities. ADMIN will also continue to make a concerted effort to expand and improve the use and operation of information technology as a means to improve ef ficiency and effectiveness of our programs. We will continue our efforts to ensure that inquiries and complaints are responded to in a reasonable amount of time, and that our expenditures are aligned with our revenues. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report - 5 - BUSINESS REGISTRATION DIVISION (BREG) website: www.BusinessRegistrations.com e-mail address: breg@dcca.state.hi.us OVERVIEW The Business Registration Division (BREG) has three primary functions. Its ministerial registration duties include the processing and maintaining for public access registrations of corporations, general and limited partnerships, limited liability partnerships, limited liability limited partnerships, limited liability companies, trade names, trademarks, service marks and publicity rights. It provides point -of-service assistance to the public to help them through the registration process necessary to start up a business in the State in the areas of business, tax and employ ment. Its regulatory function includes substantive regulatory oversight of the securities industry in the State of Hawaii in the following areas: (1) registration of broker - dealers, securities sales agents, investment advisers, investment adviser represen tatives, investment companies and securities and franchise offerings for sale in the State, (2) field examinations of broker - dealers and investment advisers in the State, (3) review of securities and franchise offerings for sale in the State, and (4) the e nforcement of the Uniform Securities Act. Composition The division's main offices are located at 335 Merchant Street, Honolulu, HI 96813 on the second floor. It also occupies three Business Action Center (BAC) offices: one at 1130 North Nimitz Highw ay, Second Level, Suite A -220, Honolulu, HI 96817; one at 70 E. Kaahumanu Ave., Unit 8- 9, Kahului, HI 96732; and one at 100 Pauahi St., Suite 109, Hilo, Hawaii 96720. In order to carry out the division's primary missions, the division is segregated int o three branches: (1) the Documents Registration Branch that includes the Business Action Center, (2) the Securities Compliance Branch that includes the Investor Education Program, and (3) the Securities Enforcement Branch. These branches are supported b y a fourth branch, the Office Services Branch. The division's staff includes attorneys, investigators, securities examiners, securities registration staff, business center specialists, investor education specialists, business registration assistants, cler k-typists, legal secretaries, licensing clerical staff, clerical support staff and administrative staff. The Documents Registration Branch maintains the business registry for corporations, limited liability companies, general partnerships, limited partne rships, limited liability limited partnerships and limited liability partnerships conducting business activities in the State. In addition, the registry contains trade names, trademarks, service marks and publicity rights. This branch consists of the Doc uments Information Section, the Documents Processing Section and the Records Section. It also includes the Business Action Center. The Business Action Center (BAC) , as part of the Documents Registration Branch, operates business centers on Oahu, Maui and the Big Island that provide point -of-service information and assistance to the public primarily to facilitate, coordinate and simplify the application process with the State for business, tax and employer registration and licensing purposes. The BAC accepts BREG filings and fees and also serves as an information clearinghouse that provides general information on county, state and federal licensing, permitting and filing requirements and assistance programs related to business or commercial activities. S ervices are delivered in -person at the center and via phone, e -mail, mail, fax, and 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Business Registration Division (BREG) - 6 - Live Chat (an instant messaging system which allows customers on the Hawaii Business Express website to obtain live help). The Securities Compliance Branch handles the re gistration activities for the securities industry operating in the State. This includes the registration of securities broker -dealers, securities sales agents, investment advisers, investment adviser representatives, investment companies, securities offer ings, and the filing of franchise offering circulars in the State. The branch is also responsible for conducting field examinations of broker -dealers and investment advisers in the State. The Division's Investor Education Program that provides investor e ducation and financial literacy outreach to the public is also part of the Securities Compliance Branch. The Securities Enforcement Branch enforces the State laws governing the securities industry, the Uniform Securities Act, by investigating and taking legal action against those persons and/or firms , both registered and unregistered, who violate securities laws or evade them. The branch has also worked in conjunction with other government agencies such as the Securities Exchange Commission, the US Commo dity Futures Trading Commission, the Office of Consumer Protection and the Insurance Division in DCCA, the Honolulu Police Department's White Collar Crime Unit, the State Attorney General's Offices, the U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee, and other federal and state securities and law enforcement agencies. GOALS, OBJECTIVES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS Documents Registration Branch The Documents Registration Branch is supervised by one branch supervisor and three section supervisors. It provides an invaluable service to t he business community in assuring that the information on file is readily available, accessible, and current in order to support commercial activities in the State. Without the availability of this information to the business community, commercial activit y in the State would be substantially impaired, since businesses depend on the information on record to support the extension of trade credit, commercial leases, real estate transactions and the delivery of financial services. The Documents Registration Branch processed over 188,000 documents this past fiscal year, up 57% from last year, and maintains the public registry of over 165,000 businesses, trade names, trade marks and service marks. The active files include business entities that have been on record with the State for over 100 years. Information is also retained for business entities that have been dissolved or cancelled. Minimal information must be kept for these inactive files for the purposes of research, litigation, real estate transactions , and general business use. As part of a n effort to make the Documents Registration Branch as convenient as possible for the public, we have been working to advance our computerized information systems so we can process and record documents with enhanced speed and accuracy. We have also been working on a new project to allow our electronic system accept wet signatures which will enhance processing by law firms and other professional filers. Goals and Objectives The goal of the Documents Registration Branch is to become one of the fastest, most efficient, customer -oriented business registries in the nation. To accomplish this goal, the branch has the following 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Business Registration Division (BREG) - 7 - objectives: (1) review and implement policies and procedures designed to achieve a level of efficiency in processing document filings and information requests in a timely manner consistent with industry best practices; (2) continue to modernize the business laws so that they track as closely as possible the most current versions of the best unif orm or model laws; (3) enhance the information systems to improve retrieval, processing and recording of public filing information while protecting the integrity of the data system, and (4) develop more online services that are useful to many. ACCOMPLISH MENTS The branch 's accomplishments and goals this year continue to be focused on actively looking at thoughtful ways to improve and automate online services for the public. We were one of the first business registries in the country with the technologic al and legal inf rastructure in place to allow both online incorporation and annual filing s and now we continue to be one of the most efficient and technologically advanced registries. Our efforts have been internationally recognized. The branch has won top honors for technological innovation four times in the recent past, as awarded by the International Association of Commercial Administrators (IACA). IACA is the leading association for business registries and has given top honors to Hawaii in 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008. This year, the branch continued to improve the documents online project that allows the public to purchase filed documents through an online webpage. Over 8218 documents were ordered online this past year. Through our redaction proje ct, we have made over 700,000 documents immediately available online as of this past fiscal year. This saves the public time and money and increases convenient public access to the registry documents, especially to businesses on the neighbor islands. The branch is continuing to upgrade the interface of its web site that can be found at www.BusinessRegistrations.com . In 2008, t he branch completed a year -long project to \"go green\" with respect to annual f ilings. This year, the \"going green\" effort has increased our online adoption rate for annual report filings to over 75% and in the second quarter of FY2011, our adoption rate has risen to over 90%. The effort continues to save the Division an estimated 560 pounds of paper and nearly $24,000 in postage a year. The increased online filing rate also reduces paper, postage and other costs for the consumer, helps keep our community green and reduces the division's manual handling, thereby allowing faster aut omated processing. We have worked to modify the timing of the postcard notification so that it saves the Division an estimated additional $2,000 per quarter on postage. In addition to annual filings, the branch currently accepts a total of 17 other onli ne filings. We are working to add more online form filings in the upcoming year. Name searches and certificates of good standing requests can also be done online. Additionally, all forms that the branch generates are now available online for the public to download. The branch also maintains its Hawaii Business Express website that allows customers to submit one filing through the internet portal to satisfy three different filings: register their business entity with the Department of Commerce and Consum er Affairs, obtain a general excise tax number from the Department of Taxation and obtain an identification number from the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations. The major project that the branch completed was a database upgrade to accommodate th e new Model Registered Agent Act that became effective July 1, 2010. This was an extensive project that took 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Business Registration Division (BREG) - 8 - over 12 months and required weekly coordination with the IT staff, registration supervisors and our online partners. The task was completed on ti me with no major disruptions to the public. The technological innovations and the work of the staff have also kept the processing times down to an average of 3 to 4 days and annual backlogs as low as a record -breaking zero. Business Action Center Branc h The BAC is supervised by a business center specialist who is responsible for five business registration assistants and three offices. The BAC runs permanent business centers on Oahu and Kahului, Maui and opened a temporary office in Hilo in February 2008. The offices offer point -of-service assistance and information to help facilitate, coordinate and simplify the application process for those who wish to register with the State in the areas of business, tax and employment. Customers interested in star ting a business receive one -on-one assistance with completing necessary business license and registration applications. Customers can also submit applications instantly, receive certain temporary tax licenses and pay fees. With the popularity of online registration increasing through Hawaii Business Express (HBE), the BAC also provides the support for \"Live Chat,\" HBE's instant messaging system accessible to online filers who have registration questions. BAC also provides e -mail, fax and phone support f or HBE or any other filers. The BAC encourages online filing by referring customers to the HBE website and providing designated terminals in the offices for customer use. Online filing reduces the number of paper filings over-the-counter at BAC while als o increasing processing efficiencies. In addition, BAC acts as a clearinghouse of information for broader business -related matters. For other industry -specific licenses and permits, the BAC provides application forms and information for obtaining them f rom the respective state, federal or county offices. The BAC also provides general business start -up information and refers prospective business owners to a broad spectrum of public and private nonprofit organizations that assist new and existing business es, and to business seminars and other training or entrepreneurial education programs. In FY10, the BAC branch assisted over 16,850 customers over the counter or via phone, e -mail, fax, or Live Chat. In particular, Live -Chat assistance continues to be popular with over 600 chats a quarter in FY10. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES The goal of the BAC is to be the most responsive and helpful point -of-service business center for business registration and licensing assistance to as many businesses in Hawaii as possib le. The BAC objectives for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2010, will be to: (1) continue to develop relationships with the business community; (2) explore better ways to accept business, employer and state tax registration filings from the remote BAC sites such as Maui and Hilo; (3) continue seeking ways to reach communities in need of business registration assistance and to market BAC's services; and (4) continue working closely with other state agencies (including cross -training) to help increase compl iance with new laws. ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Business Registration Division (BREG) - 9 - BAC continues to support the temporary office in Hilo and the permanent offices in Maui and Oahu. In FY10, the BAC has worked with accounting firms to see if BAC can set up a volunteer accounting assistance program similar to the volunteer lawyers program at the BAC. In addition, the BAC participated in workshops and counseling sessions throughout Hawaii, many with the military. The BAC has also expanded outreach services to other state agencies such as the Departm ent of Health in Kapolei. We are striving to meet the needs of our community and look forward to continue to do so in the upcoming fiscal year. The BAC continues to host the Hawaii State Bar Association volunteer lawyers project where HSBA attorneys come to the BAC Nimitz office and offer free legal services to BAC customers each Thursday. This is one of BAC's most popular programs. In addition, BAC has set up a feedback survey for users of the BAC and the response has been consistent in recognizing the quality and value of BAC to small businesses. We have received a number of letters of gratitude from businesses that began as small businesses seeking assistance from BAC and have grown to big businesses. The BAC also hosts U.S. Small Business Administr ation representatives who offer financial services counseling to our customers once a week. The BAC continues to work with the Service Corps of Retired Executives (\"SCORE\"). SCORE is a nonprofit organization partially funded by the U.S. Small Business Ad ministration. It provides business counseling and mentoring services free of charge. BAC customers are paired with a SCORE volunteer, who may be an attorney, accountant, marketing expert, business owner in the same industry as the BAC customer, or other expert, depending on the needs of the customer. SCORE volunteers meet in one -on-one sessions with the customer to offer advice. If no local SCORE volunteer fits the customer's needs, SCORE can find a volunteer with the requisite expertise through its nat ion-wide network of volunteers. These partnerships allow unique opportunities for small business owners to speak with experts on a one -on-one basis. Securities Compliance Branch The Securities Compliance Branch of t he division is supervised by a s pecialist who is responsible for the work of six examiners, five licensing clerical staff, and two secretar ies. The branch currently has approximately 76,150 securities salespersons and 1417 broker/dealer firms on record registered to sell securities. In add ition, the branch has 58 state registered investment advisory firms and over 1600 registered investment adviser representatives on record. The branch also processed over 830 franchise offering circular filings and approximately 340 filings for the private placement of securities in FY10 and conducted 18 exams. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES The goal of the Securities Compliance Branch and Securities Enforcement Branch is to become one of the most effective state securities regulatory agencies in the country. To accomplish this goal, the Securities Compliance Branch's objectives are to: (1) implement an ongoing comprehensive training program, ( 2) implement a regular field examination cycle for registered broker/dealers and state registered investment advisers, a nd (3) develop valuable investor education programs and materials that improve inves tor awareness of fraud, reach communities throughout Hawaii with investor education materials and increase investor education efforts for students throughout the State. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Business Registration Division (BREG) - 10 - With respect to investor education, in particular, we are currently in the process of (1) implementing rules and laws to take advantage of the new Dodd -Frank Wall Street Consumer Protection Act in order to apply for up to $500,000 in federal funds for state investor education efforts; (2) continuing our partnerships with nonprofits and state agencies in order to expand outreach throughout Hawaii to Native Hawaiians, the military, labor unions and others; (3) continuing our efforts to keep our kupuna informed; (4) increasing investor education programs for our keiki; and (5) improving our website features and developing electronic media. ACCOMPLISHMENTS The staff is beginning training on the new provisions of the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Consumer Protection Act (\"Dodd Frank Act\") and the Commissioner has worked throughout the year to make sure Hawaii interests are included in national positions on the act and the final implementation of the act. The Commissioner was on the cabinet of the national securities regulator organization (the North American Securities Administrators' Association or NASAA) in FY10 as the head of the Investor Education Section, advocating for the passage of the Senior Designation provisions of the Dodd- Frank Act. The act now includes funds for investor education of up to $500,000 per state. The Commissioner also led the NASAA Investor Education section to launch the first national effort to reach women in transition from widowhood, divorce, or other circumstances with investor assista nce. One of the most significant changes in the Dodd- Frank Act for the states is that it expands jurisdiction of state regulators to investment advisers with assets under management of up to $100 million, thus increasing the states' exams and registration services to include larger and more complex firms. We will be working to accommodate the new demands on the Division and to get staff up to speed on the additional complexities. The act also places limitations on notice filings for securities violators. In addition, the Commissioner has worked with NASAA to advocate for a fiduciary standard for broker dealers to match that of investment advisers. This fiduciary standard for broker dealers continues to be a heated debate that has garnered the support of Senator Akaka. He continues to champion it as an improved standard to protect retail consumers and the Commissioner's office continues to support his efforts. This will be a continuing debate as the US Securities and Exchange Commission looks to possibly implement new rules in the coming year. Staff continues to efficiently manage the volume of applications and renewals received each year and the number of pending applications for broker -dealers , sales agents, investment advisers and their representat ives remains very low. The f ield exam ination program continues to provide examinations of broker -dealers and state -registered investment advisers in Hawaii. Examinations of broker -dealers and investment advisers located on all islands throughout the Stat e are being conducted o n a continuing basis to provide onsite review of compliance with Hawaii State law. The branch is also continuing its comprehensive training program for professional development of its securities examiners staff with an additional e mphasis on the new requirements included in the Dodd- Frank Act . Currently, the branch is supporting training leading to the Certified Regulatory and Compliance Professional from the FINRA Institute at Wharton . The division currently has two certified exa miners and one additional staff member preparing to be certified. Last year, the branch developed the comprehensive State Investment Adviser Guide to help firms understand the state compliance requirements and the manner in which to prepare for a firm ex amination conducted by the state securities compliance branch. The guide was developed to help small firms with 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Business Registration Division (BREG) - 11 - limited resources to better understand the compliance requirements. The guide has been produced with an interactive index and is placed on our website at http://hawaii.gov/dcca/sec/iag . NASAA has now shown interests in making a similar guide a national resource and we are looking to assist NASAA in that effort. Investor education continues to be another important component to securities regulation, and we continue to expand the outreach statewide to new audiences as well as difference community events. The division completed 35 presentations in FY10, and participated in 43 community events in FY 10, through which we reached an estimated 90,712 consumers in Hawaii in FY10. We have continued with the new union outreach program that we developed last year. This program was developed to combat investor affinity fraud perpetrated through unions. Af finity fraud that takes advantage of trusting relationships within tight knit groups has been increasing in Hawaii and throughout the nation. To combat this fraud within unions and to reach working families in unions, the branch developed investor educati on materials and presentations customized for union members. The branch actively continues to seek to work with union leadership to bring the message to the membership. This program has been so successful that the program has been replicated at the national level by NASAA. In the past, the division also partnered extensively with the Hawaii Council on Economic Education (HCEE) to support financial literacy and investor education for our keiki. We have also supported two other HCEE programs. The first is Na Wai Puapuai (Care for Our Future), a financial literacy and investor education curriculum that incorporates Native Hawaiian culture into the lesson plans. It includes traditional lelo no eau into the course work and was developed to be compliant with the No Child Left Behind Act, making it easier for teachers to adopt the curriculum. In the past, the program has reached 75 teachers who reported their intent to use the lesson plans for 2,163 students, exceeding the original teacher goal by 25%. We very much hope to look to re -implement this program in FY11. Outreaching to the Native Hawaiian community remains a priority for FY11 and we look forward to continue to build our relationships. The branch maintains nearly 70 handouts, brochures, booklets, CDs, DVDs, guides & mini -guides covering a wide range of investor education topics from how to select an investment professional to how to avoid scams and fraud. We also have six investor protection presentations and 20 special large print handouts that have been nota bly popular with our seniors. Securities Enforcement Branch The Securities Enforcement Branch of the division is supervised by a Senior Enforcement Attorney who is responsible for the regulatory enforcement activities of four attorneys, one supervising i nvestigator, six investigators, and five clerical staff. The difficult nature and complexity of the cases being handled by the branch is increasing every year. Cases involving multiple respondents, multiple complainants, and multiple bank accounts are oc curring with much greater frequency today requiring extensive financial analysis . The branch continues with the implementation of a comprehensive training program to improve the quality and efficiency of the securities enforcement work. The program consi sts of: (1) cross -training with registration clerks and securities examiners of the Securities Compliance branch, (2) in -house training with panels of regulatory enforcement and legal experts from other regulatory and law enforcement agencies, academia, a nd industry, and (3) outside training classes and conferences. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Business Registration Division (BREG) - 12 - GOAL S AND OBJECTIVES As mentioned above, t he goal of the Securities Compliance Branch and Securities Enforcement Branch is to become one of the most effective state securities regulatory agencies in the country. To that end, t he Securities Enforcement Branch's objectives are to: (1) investigate and prosecute state securities violations under the Uniform Securities Act; (2) intake complaints from the public and respond quickly and appropriat ely; (3) reduce case backlog; (4) inform consumers of enforcement matters and investment scams through participating in investor education; (5) develop and implement internal procedures that will improve the timely and effective resolution of cases, improving the branch's overall effectiveness; (6) attend and develop training to keep professional staff current on emerging investigative techniques, legal analysis and trends in securities fraud and other securities violations; (7) draft and assist in securiti es legislation; and (8) work with the media to rais e public awareness . ACCOMPLISHMENTS As a result of the enforcement work of the branch in FY10, the division issued three (3) preliminary orders to cease and desist with penalty recommendations of $1,850,000, obtained two (2) final orders, and issued fourteen (14) consent agreements or orders, imposing $3,814,908 in penalties. During the past fiscal year, the branch collected $3,549,410 in fines and penalties. The securities enforcement branch has been involved in the litigation and settlements of major banks over the freezing of the auction rate securities markets, a market estimated to be over $300 billion. Hawaii has assisted the North American Securities Administrators' Association in the multi- state actions. Resolutions are pending. The Securities Enforcement Branch has continued with the implementation of an extensive and comprehensive training program that includes: (1) outside training in the form of seminars and conferences specifically aim ed at improving skills , staying up -to-date with the increasing complexity of cases and achieving more effective regulatory actions, and (2) frequent interaction with regulators in other states and, particularly in specific areas including franchises and br oker dealer operations. The training and interaction have resulted in more focused enforcement , effective impact on the market and increased attention on the use of conduct remedies and monetary penalties. Currently, the branch is supporting training lea ding to the Certified Fraud Examiners designation for investigators (4 certified) and the Certified Regulatory and Compliance Professional from the FINRA Institute for Professional Development for attorneys (2 certified). The CRF financial summary relatin g to BREG for FY 09- 10 is as follows: CONCLUSION The Business Registration Division continues to receive business filings, requests to purchase business documents, business registration inquiries, securities and franchise registration filings, securities and franchise inquiries and securities and franchise complaints that indicate an enduring need for the Personnel Expenses Operating Expenses Total Expenses Revenues Received $4,107,166 $866,151 $4,973,317 $8,816,269 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Business Registration Division (BREG) - 13 - essential government services in volving the business registry, business action center, securities law enforcement, securities registration and investor education outreach. The demand for the division's services has necessitated improved information systems to handle the workload, more s ophisticated online support, increased training to improve the quality of regulatory oversight, increased personnel and constant attention and commitment to the changing, increasingly complex needs for service . In addition, the division has worked extensi vely with NASAA to assist in the national regulatory reform effort and to promote and advocate positions that best support Hawaii's retail consumers. The Commissioner continues to work extensively with NASAA, having served on its cabinet in FY10 in an eff ort to reach as many consumers as possible to alert them to fraud, ways to protect themselves and where to turn for help. We look to continue to be involved with NASAA to make sure Hawaii's interests and concerns are included and advanced. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report - 14 - CABLE TELEVI SION DIVISION (CATV) website: www.hawaii.gov/dcca/catv e-mail address: Cable Television Division (CATV) supports the Direc tor in the regulation of cable television operators. CATV's primary function is to determine whether the initial issuance, renewal, or transfer of a cable franchise is in the public's best interest. This determination is made only after careful consideration by CATV of the public need for the proposed service, the adequacy, efficiency, and reliability of service, and the technical, financial, and operational ability of the franchisee. After the issuance of a franchise, CATV's role in protecting the publ ic interest continues. CATV acts to enforce obligations of the franchisee and to ensure compliance with rules and regulations relating to cable operators' practices and procedures. CATV continues to monitor the franchisee to ensure that the cable operati ng system is reliable and responsive to the public. Such reliability and responsiveness to the public's interest may be indicated by operators providing the widest possible diversity of information sources and services and enhancing communication capabili ties for its communities by supporting the interconnection of public facilities, public television, and public, educational and government access. CATV is cognizant of the increasing importance of cable service to the people of Hawaii. With advanced technology, cable systems are becoming more than strictly a source of entertainment, and increasingly serve as a means of providing informational and educational programming. Therefore, the Division recognizes that the extension of cable service to all commu nities within the franchised areas should remain a high priority. Included within the responsibility of overseeing all franchised wireline cable operators within the State, and as an integral part of the cable regulatory scheme, CATV responds to public i nquiries, concerns, and complaints. Staff is trained to assist, provide answers, refer the complaint to the appropriate cable operator in the franchised area, or otherwise inform the general public of complaint -filing procedures. It is the division's mis sion to oversee that all complaints and concerns are researched and result in some form of resolution. In furtherance of this goal, CATV will continue to monitor how customer service concerns are being addressed and to examine the degree of customer satis faction by reviewing surveys and reports. The division will continue to encourage operators to develop new, improved, or more effective utilization of cable communications services and facilities that enhance customer based services to the people of Hawai i. In addition to overseeing system operators, CATV is also responsible for the expansion of the State's Institutional Network (\"INET\") in a manner that is efficient and effective for the State. The INET is constructed for two- way operation as part of t he cable system and provides broadband telecommunications capabilities among government and educational organizations. The recent growth in information processing, storage, and retrieval by the State illustrates the increasing need for high transmission c apacity with a more flexible network configuration which may be achieved through the INET. In 2010, the Hawaii State Legislature passed Act 199 which added broadband and telework responsibilities to CATV's responsibilities. CATV requested increased fina ncial and personnel resources as authorized by Act 199, but its request was not acted upon; another request will be submitted shortly. CATV has convened four meetings (as of 12 -9-10) of the Permitting Work Group that is assessing the State 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Cable Television Division (CATV) - 15 - as well as Coun ties approval and permitting processes that may impact deployment of broadband infrastructure and services. The discussion at these meetings has evolved and focused on the issue of pole attachments. Wireline providers have voiced deep concerns on their a bility to attach additional fiber to poles based on calculations that deem a pole standard or sub- standard. Additionally, CATV will also convene the Broadband Advisory Council once members are appointed by the Hawaii State Senate and the House of Represen tatives. In its franchise agreements with cable operators, the State requires that cable operators set aside a number of channels for public, educational and governmental access (\"PEG\") and provide a percentage of gross revenues for PEG use. The State h as delegated oversight of the access channels and funds to non- profit groups, one in each of the four counties. Composition The staff of CATV currently consists of an administrator, attorney, program specialist, and secretary. The office is located on t he first floor of the King Kalakaua Building at 335 Merchant Street. Mailing address: P.O. Box 541, Honolulu, address: www.hawaii.gov/dcca/catv . GOALS and OBJECTIVES CATV's performance measurements include various categories of information. Among others, CATV is involved with federal legislation and FCC rulemaking that impact Hawaii residents, Institutional Network (\"INET\") expansion and enhancement, PEG practices and policies, consumer / subscriber matters and complaints, and monitoring of non- cable technologies such as Direct Broadcast Satellite (\"DBS\") service. Only some of these activities of significant impact to Hawaii residents are easily measured. Some of these are described below in the Accomplishments section. 1) Ensure consistent cable television regulatory policies and practices - Conduct regularly scheduled franchise fee and PEG reviews - Complete public procurement process for PEG services, consistent wi th chapter 103D, HRS - Collaborate on INET deployment - Convene periodic Cable Advisory Committee meetings 2) Monitor and participate in federal telecommunications legislation and rulemaking. - Continue working with Hawaii's congressional delegation on federal legislation - Continue our working relationship with the FCC on DBS and other cable related matters - Continue to monitor federal issues that may have an impact to Hawaii cable television subscribers 3) Advocate for equivalent DBS, and other enhanced services. - Ensure that DirecTV and DishNetwork comply with FCC order regarding service to Hawaii - Monitor development and deployment of new advanced services - Ensure that Hawaii receives equivalent service as does the mainland 4) Broadband - Implement requiremen ts of Act 199 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Cable Television Division (CATV) - 16 - - Continue to lead INET initiatives - Advocate for Hawaii's Broadband future ACCOMPLISHMENTS Broadband - Hawaii Broadband Task Force (HBTF) and Act 199 - CATV Admini strator was a member of the State's Broadband Task Force which developed the foundation for Act 199 that was passed by the 2010 Legislature. The HBTF met over 2 years to address many significant issues facing the deployment and expansion of world class broadband infrastructure and services in the State. Act 199 designated CATV to ser ve as the focal point for broadband issues affecting the State, and also created the Permitting Work Group and Broadband Advisory Council to address some of the broadband matters identified by HBTF. The Work Group has met periodically and will be submitti ng a report to the 2011 Legislature. American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Broadband Mapping Project - DCCA / CATV was awarded $4.3M in ARRA funds to develop and maintain Hawaii's broadband map that will identify broadband services, speeds, and prices t hroughout the State. The data from Hawaii's map will be incorporated into the National broadband map that is part of the National Broadband Plan. The $4.3M award funding will be expended over a 5 year period ending December 2014. Hawaii Health Information Exchange (\"HHIE\") - CATV's administrator is a member of the State's oversight committee relating to ARRA Health Information Exchange initiatives. The State of Hawaii designated the HHIE, a third party, non- profit organization, to implement the ARRA hea lth information exchange initiatives. As a member of the State's oversight committee, the CATV administrator works closely with the HHIE to guide compliance with federal requirements. Broadband Infrastructure to Department of Education schools, State Libraries, University of Hawaii Community College locations - CATV and the University of Hawaii together developed a grant to interconnect all DOE schools, state libraries, and community colleges with broadband capacity. The CATV will continue as a partner w ith UH, DOE and the State Library in the implementation of this $34M ARRA award. Public Computing Centers - CATV, the University of Hawaii and the State Librarian worked together to develop a grant to provision all state libraries and certain community colleges with equipment that would allow utilization of broadband capacity and services that are planned for these locations. These public computing centers would allow individuals without equipment or access to broadband, to access services such as the int ernet. CATV, the UH and the Hawaii State Library will continue to partner on the implementation of this $1.5M ARRA award. Institutional Network (\"INET\") - CATV continues its leadership role in the development, expansion and enhancement of the INET. Working with the INET Partners [ (1) the CATV Division, (2) the Information, Communications and Services Division (\"ICSD\") of the Department of Accounting and General Services, (3) the University of Hawaii (\"UH\") and (4) the Department of Education (\"DOE\") ], CATV continued its leadership role in the upgrade and expansion of the INET that existing cable television franchises in the deployment of broadband infrastructure for education and government applications. The 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Cable Television Division (CATV) - 17 - interconnection of the islands of Oahu, Maui , Kauai and Hawaii via submarine fiber provides the INET Partners with seamless, broadband networking capabilities between these islands. As of the end of FY 10 (June 30, 2010), TWE held approximately $ 4.9 M in an interest -bearing account on behalf of the DCCA for INET purposes and broadband activities . These funds are the result of an agreement between the DCCA and Olelo regarding cable t elevision franchise fees that are collected from Oahu cable t elevision subscribers. Oceanic Time Warner Cable of H awaii (\"Oceanic\") - Oahu Franchise Renewal - Oceanic submitted an application to renew its cable franchise for the island of Oahu. CATV along with its consultant held numerous meetings with various stakeholders and groups seeking comments on the renewal of the Oahu franchise. In addition CATV held four public meetings to ensure that the public had ample opportunity to provide input into the renewal process. CATV approved a new Oahu franchise agreement in January 2010. The new franchise requires Oceanic to utilize the latest technology to provide a wide diversity of information sources and services to the public. For example, in the renewed franchise order, CATV directed Oceanic to more than double the number of cable channels available for local uses (i .e., PEG channels, government use, and educational use) in the State, increasing the channels from six to fourteen. Hawaiian Telcom (\"Hawtel\") Application For a Cable Television Franchise - Hawtel submitted an application for a cable franchise on May 5, 2006 which was accepted by DCCA on June 21, 2006. On December 1, 2008 Hawtel filed voluntary petitions for Chapter 11 reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code . On October 28, 2010, Hawtel emerged from Chapter 11. Hawtel submitted a new application for a new cable franchise to CATV on November 5, 2010 and withdrew its prior application. CATV is reviewing and processing the new application. Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) Service - CATV continues to be the State's advocate for DBS service and other non -wireline services that would benefit Hawaii residents. Although DBS is regulated on the federal level by the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\"), CATV recognizes the importance of this service not only as a competitor to cable television service but also as a provider of unique services that Hawaii must have access to. CATV continues its advocacy with the FCC as well as with Hawaii's congressional delegation on matters not only involving cable, but a wide range of broadband and telecommunications ma tters. Franchise fee reviews and refunds - CATV has contracted with a certified public accounting firm to conduct reviews of the franchise fee payment process of the cable operators in each of the different franchise areas. Based on the results of revie ws of the franchise fee calculation, collection, and payment process for all franchise areas, DCCA ordered refunds to cable subscribers over the past 8 years, totaling approximately $1.4 million. CATV -DCCA is continuing these reviews periodically to ensur e that the franchise fee collection process is being conducted accurately. Federal Telecommunications Legislation and FCC Rulemaking - CATV continues to monitor and participate in recent developments in Congress and at the FCC. Although proposed comprehe nsive telecommunications legislation, which would have replaced the Telecommunications Act of 1996, is no longer currently expected, CATV continues its on- going work with Hawaii's congressional delegation and the FCC. The CATV division actively monitors t hese issues and participates in matters affecting cable television consumers in Hawaii. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Cable Television Division (CATV) - 18 - PEG Contracts and Public Procurement - In 2005 DCCA was informed that its contracts with PEG access organizations are subject to the State Procurement Code. In July 2007, DCCA through the State Procurement Office issued the 2007 RFP. Since the issuance of the RFP, protests to the RFP were submitted to SPO, and as a result SPO postponed the RFP process until the protests could be addressed. In addition lawsuits were filed to prevent the public procurement process from proceeding. The lawsuits were subsequently resolved, and the 2007 RFP was cancelled. In May 2010, DCCA through the State Procurement Office issued another RFP. Protests have been filed in this RFP, and SPO and DCCA worked on resolving the protests and completing the procurement process. The DCCA's current contracts with the various PEG access organizations have been exempted from the procurement code by the SPO until December 31, 2010. The DCCA will be requesting a further extension of the exemption from the SPO in order to comply with state procurement law and to continue working with the SPO in the RFP process. The CRF financial summary relating to CATV for FY -09 is as follows: Personnel Expenses Operating Expenses Total Expenses Revenues Received $370,811 $547,576 $918,387 $1,455,615 CONCLUSION The year 2010 was a remarkable year for CATV, due in part to the rapid development of advanced technology by cable companies. The continued enhanceme nt of the fiber to node architecture provided increased bandwidth capacity for traditional services such as video programming as well as for new interactive and digital services. Thus, given the nascent nature of digital technology relative to cable, CATV had and presently has the continuing task of monitoring the public's present needs and future interests. Because of the rapid advancements in telecommunications, CATV seized the opportunity to provide a more uniform standard of practice within the State , offer improved services to meet the needs of the public, and provide greater reliability and responsiveness without financially impairing the system operators. CATV will strive to ensure fairness to the public in the provision of cable television servic es. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund R eport - 19 - DIVISION OF CONSUMER ADVOCACY (DCA) website: www.hawaii.gov/dcca/dca/ e-mail address: consumeradvocate@dcca.hawaii.gov OVERVIEW The Divisio n of Consumer Advocacy (\"DCA\") represents, protects, and advances the interests of consumers of utility and transportation services before regulatory agencies, primarily the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission (\"PUC\") and the Federal Communications Commissi on (\"FCC\"). The DCA reviews requests for rate and tariff changes, capital improvement projects, integrated resource plans, certificates for authority to operate, and other applications filed by public utility and transportation companies, in addition to other proceedings opened by regulatory agencies to investigate or review generic issues. In representing the consumers of utility and transportation services before the PUC, the DCA must analyze financial and statistical data, prior docketed material, indu stry standards, and the information provided by the utility and transportation companies to support their applications. After analyzing the information, the DCA generally submits either written statements of position or testimonies explaining its analyses , findings, and recommendations to the PUC. Oral testimonies by DCA analysts, subject to utility company cross - examination, are required when an evidentiary hearing before the PUC is scheduled to resolve differences among the parties to a proceeding. COMPOSITION The DCA consists of 11 employees, ranging from an administrator, a secretary, a utilities/transportation officer, a utilities/transportation specialist, researchers, engineers, attorneys, and clerical support. The DCA is located on the third f loor of the King Kalakaua Building, 335 Merchant Street. Its contact information is as follows: mailing address, P.O. Box 541, Honolulu, HI 96809; phone number, 586- 2800; internet address, www.hawaii.gov/dcca/dca/. The majority of the DCA's professiona l staff is comprised of the Rate Analysis Branch, the Engineering Branch, the Research Branch, and the Legal Branch. The Rate Analysis Branch reviews and analyzes economic conditions, investor requirements and returns, and other aspects relating to the c apital structure of regulated public utilities and transportation companies. In addition, the Branch evaluates and develops recommendations relating to rate schedules, effects of rates, sales levels, and other pertinent considerations in establishing rate s. The Engineering Branch analyzes and makes recommendations on technical matters such as production capacity and efficiency, depreciation allowances, maintenance cost factors, engineering safety standards, plans for capital improvements, purchased power agreements, and quality of service standards. The Research Branch analyzes and advises on matters imposed by regulated public utility and transportation industries, provides services and advice relating to the current operations of and evolving changes t o regulated public utilities and transportation industries, conducts special studies on the changes in various regulatory areas, including energy and telecommunications, and assists and participates with other units in developing data and conducting analys es on matters under examination. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Consumer Advocacy (DCA) - 20 - The Legal Branch provides legal representation before regulatory agencies. The branch also provides general clerical support by updating and maintaining the DCA's docket, general office, and electronic data base files, f ormatting draft documents prepared by the technical staff and attorneys for filing with regulatory agencies and utility companies, and maintaining the office library, among other things. Not counting the Legal Branch, the DCA is authorized to have up to nine exempt positions, under HRS \u00a7 269- 52(1). Pursuant to Act 130, SLH 2010, funding was provided to restore four of the exempt positions, as well as four of the civil service positions that were abolished by the 2009 Legislature. The DCA also has a staf f level position - the Public Utilities/Transportation Specialist - that assists the Public Utilities/Transportation Officer in managing the overall workload pertaining to matters filed before the regulatory agencies, such as the PUC and FCC. In addition to providing analysis on docketed filings, the Education Specialist is responsible for consumer education and outreach, which is accomplished by attending various community events throughout the State to gain public input about specific issues affecting co nsumers and to provide information on utility services. The Education Specialist is also responsible for updating and maintaining the DCA's web site and publishing a quarterly newsletter. Given the D CA's historical difficulty in attracting and retaining staff, in 2008, the DCA received authorization to reorganize, tailoring the position descriptions to be better aligned with the position duties and work of the DCA. Since the restoration of the eight positions in FY2010, the DCA has worked on completing the necessary position descriptions that would allow the DCA to recruit for these positions. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES The DCA's goals and objectives can be categorized generally in three broad areas: consumer advocacy, policy advancement, and consumer educ ation and outreach. These areas are not mutually exclusive and often overlap; however, for purposes of describing the DCA's goals and how the DCA will reach them, the goals will be described separately. Consumer Advocacy Goal The DCA's goal may involve some balance. Ensuring that Hawaii's consumers receive fairly priced rates for safe and reliable services , while ensuring customer and environmental protections and renewable resource use, is the DCA's responsibility and primary goal. Planned Appr oach/Methods The DCA has and will continue to achieve this goal by advocating for consumers of regulated utility and transportation services wherever their interests are at stake. Typically, this occurs before the PUC, but may also be before other federa l, State or local agencies and legislative bodies. A majority of the DCA's resources will continue to be focused on PUC proceedings. These proceedings often may affect the rates and the reliability of utility and transportation systems and services. The DCA's participation in PUC proceedings will typically involve some or all of the following: 1. Review of applications to ensure compliance with regulations; 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Consumer Advocacy (DCA) - 21 - 2. Participation at PUC public hearings; 3. Procurement of consultant services to manage workload and for complex cases; 4. Completion of discovery; 5. Analysis of applications and supporting documents to determine the accuracy and the reasonableness of the requests; 6. Provision of recommendations to the PUC on the merits of the applications through statements of position or direct testimonies; provision of oral testimonies, which are subject to cross -examination in proceedings where evidentiary hearings are necessary; and 7. Completion of related legal actions, such as filings of legal briefs, motions, appeals, etc., where necessary. The DCA also will remain flexible and willing to work with parties to proceedings to negotiate and settle proceedings or particular issues when they are in the consumers' best interest. Measures To measure the DCA's p erformance in advocating consumer interests, the DCA will continue to track various categories of information. Among others, the DCA monitors consumer savings due to its participation in PUC proceedings, the percentage of PUC decisions that agree with the DCA's recommendations, the number of service quality investigations it participates in, and the number of filings before the PUC reviewed by the DCA. Only some of the significant impacts that the DCA's participation may have upon consumers are easily me asured. Some of the impacts that are not easily measured will generally be discussed below in the DCA's explanation of its policy advancement objectives. Policy Advancement Goal The DCA will remain active in promoting policies to protect and advanc e the interests of utility and transportation consumers on the local, State, and national levels. Planned Approach/Methods In the PUC's generic, investigative, or policy proceedings, the DCA follows a similar approach to its review and analysis of app lications. A typical investigative proceeding may involve the following steps: After the DCA and other parties to the proceeding state their initial positions on the issues, discovery and analyses are done to determine the reasonableness of the other par ties' positions; Technical meetings between the parties are often held to discuss and educate each other on the issues and positions taken, and to determine where possible agreement may be reached; and The DCA then provides the PUC with a recommendation that it believes is in the best interest of consumers. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Consumer Advocacy (DCA) - 22 - Evidentiary or panel hearings are held by the PUC to take evidence provided orally by DCA witnesses or consultants hired by DCA to provide expert testimonies on specific technical issues. Specific ongo ing investigative dockets are discussed later in this report. The DCA has monitored, and will continue to monitor, Congressional activity in the energy and telecommunications areas. The DCA will continue to maintain contact with Hawaii's Congressional delegation, particularly those members sitting on committees that deal with energy and telecommunications, and will continue to provide input where appropriate. The DCA will also continue to be actively involved and advocate for Hawaii consumers, through it s membership in the National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates (\"NASUCA\"). NASUCA is active before the FCC, Congress, and the federal courts in advancing consumer interests on national issues that impact consumers locally. The DCA will als o remain actively involved with the State Legislature, which sets policy at the State level. The DCA advises legislators through testimonies that detailed consumer benefits or detriments of specific proposals the legislators were considering. The DCA has attempted to take a more proactive approach by working with legislators and policy groups on the development of proposals, while maintaining a consistent policy position as advocated by the Governor's office. Measures Measuring performance of efforts to promote policy objectives is inexact. While the DCA tracks the percentage of its positions with which the PUC ultimately agrees, the measure does not capture the efforts throughout proceedings to educate and work with other parties to come to agreement on issues. The DCA can develop similar measures (e.g., whether its recommendations are ultimately agreed with by those setting the policy) for the State and federal agency and legislative bodies, but similar challenges with the imprecise nature of the measurement will result. Education & Outreach Goal The DCA's goal is to encourage the public to be wiser consumers of public utility services by, among other things, emphasizing the possible effects that their consumption habits may have on utility rates and the environment. It is through the education and outreach process that the DCA aims to gather consumer input on utility issues and to encourage consumers to be more involved in utility proceedings. In addition, with Hawaii's Clean Energy Initiative, the consumers need to be aware that many of the benefits will not be immediately apparent in their bills. Thus, education of reasonable expectations is necessary to avoid misinformation from occurring. Planned Approach/Methods 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Consumer Advocacy (DCA) - 23 - The DCA can accomplish its goal of positively affecting the habits of consumers on a statewide basis through the use of its web site and public outreach activities. The DCA established the following action plan to accomplish its goals and objectives: 1. Update and improve its webs ite with consumer -friendly and useful content; 2. Establish information booths and provide presentations at community events, such as home shows and public fairs throughout the State and build positive relationships with both business and individual community members; 3. Improve communications with consumers and the public through expanded distribution and publication of its newsletter; and 4. Hold informational seminars or use public service announcements to highlight different utility issues and topics. Measures To measure the DCA's performance and progress of its education and outreach activities, it will track the number of people reached through education and outreach events, newsletters and other publications distributed, and consumers assisted wit h complaints and other issues. ACCOMPLISHMENTS In 2010, results of the DCA's efforts to protect and advance the interests of consumers were seen through its work on behalf of individual communities, as well as major utility issues that will have far - reaching impacts on people throughout the State. Several of these efforts are described below. Rate Cases The Gas Company, LLC's (\"TGC\") 2009 Test Year Rate Case On April 30, 2008, TGC filed an application for approval to increase its rates (by approxim ately $12,510,047 or 8.46% increase over revenue at present rates ), establish a new commercial rate on the island of Kauai, restructure certain of its rates and schedules, and revise or update certain of its r ules. The DCA, among other things, participate d in public hearings held statewide, conducted inspections and witness interviews, developed testimonies, engaged in a negotiation process with TGC to resolve the outstanding issues of this proceeding, and answered numerous information requests of the PUC. On June 4, 2009, the PUC issued its Interim Decision and Order approving, which approved an increase in revenues over present rates of $9,519,293 or approximately 11.03% for TGC . In so doing, the PUC approve d the Parties' Joint Statement of Probable Ent itlement in Support of Interim Rates, filed on May 22, 2009, as supplemented. Additional discovery and analysis was conducted in FY 2010 in order to continue to build the record in this rate case. The Commission filed its Final Decision and Order in this proceeding on April 20, 2010 and ultimately approved an increase of $9,211,450, which reflected additional adjustments that resulted in a decrease of $307,843 to TGC's final revenue requirements. Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc.'s (\"HECO\") 2009 Test Year Rate Case 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Consumer Advocacy (DCA) - 24 - On July 3, 2008, HECO filed an application for approval to increase its rates (by approximately $97,011,000, or 5.2%, over revenues at current effective rates) and to amend its rules. The DCA, among other things, participated in a public hear ing, conducted inspections and witness interviews, developed testimonies, and engaged in a negotiation process with HECO and the Department of the Navy to resolve most of the outstanding issues of this proceeding (two outstanding issues - Informational Adv ertising Expense and the Overall Rate of Return - were argued at an evidentiary hearing held during the last week of October and the first week of November 2009). On August 3, 2009, the PUC rendered an interim decision, approving approximately $61,098,000 in additional revenues, or a 4.71% increase over revenues at current effective rates for a normalized 2009 test year . Transcripts of the evidentiary hearing were filed with the PUC on November 23, 2009. The parties filed opening and reply briefs on January 5, 2010 and January 26, 2010, respectively. Subsequently, the Commission filed its second Interim Decision and Order on February 19, 2010, allowing HECO to include the costs associated with its newest generating unit that is meant to be fueled primari ly with biofuel, which increased the approved revenue requirements by $12,620,000. Additional work and analyses were done subsequent to the second Interim Decision and Order in FY 2010 addressing certain questions related to decoupling. The final decision and order in this proceeding is pending. Molokai Public Utilities, Inc.'s (\"MPUI\") and Waiola O Molokai, Inc.'s (\"WOMI\") Rate Cases On June 16, 2008, the PUC issued an order opening a proceeding to provide temporary rate relief to MPUI and WOMI, respo nding to the announcement in late March 2008 by Molokai Properties, Limited, pursuant to its announcement to cease all current business operations on Molokai, that it would no longer be able to subsidize its utility companies, and it was planning for their disposal within six months . During the fiscal year, the DCA participated in public hearings and meetings, interviewed customers, conducted analysis of the limited financial information available from the companies, and provided the PUC with a statement o f position reluctantly stating non- opposition of the rate increases. On August 14, 2008, the PUC approved rate increases for the companies, effective on September 1, 2008. The PUC's Decision and Order required MPUI and WOMI to file rate increase applicat ions within six months of the date of the Decision and Order if a third party was not found to take over the utilities. On March 2, 2009, MPUI and WOMI filed rate increase applications with the PUC, requesting revenue increases of $562,550 and $308,781 over revenues at present rates for MPUI and WOMI, respectively. The DCA objected via statements regarding completeness of applications to MPUI's and WOMI's requests to waive the requirement to file audited financial statements in compliance with the PUC's rules. On April 2, 2009, the PUC denied MPUI's and WOMI's requests to file unaudited financial statements, requiring the companies to obtain independently audited financial statements and to file amended applications reflecting such audited financials. On June 29, 2009, MPUI and WOMI filed amended applications for rate increase with the PUC, seeking net revenue increases of $886,259 and $473,431 for MPUI and WOMI, respectively, using the pro forma revenue amounts at present rates for the 2009 -2010 test y ear. Based on the temporary rates authorized in the Temporary Rate Order, MPUI 's proposed net revenue increase amounts to $565,939, which is an approximate 74.6% i ncrease from the pro forma revenue amount of $758,958 at the temporary rate for the 2009- 2010 test year . Based on the temporary rates authorized in the Temporary Rate Order, WOMI's proposed net revenue increase amounts to $308,431, which is an approximate 106.96% increase from the pro forma revenue amount of $288,360 at the temporary rate for the 2009- 2010 test ye ar. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Consumer Advocacy (DCA) - 25 - During FY 2010, the DCA participated in the public hearings, and due to the presence of intervenors, the proceeding was rather contentious. DCA participated in the discovery process and submitted written testimonies. Due to ongoing litigation between the County of Maui and the Applicants, there was a mediation process that was ongoing and the parties to the proceedings before the Commission were asked to participate in this mediation process, which the DCA did. While an agreement w as reached between the utility companies and the DCA, the County of Maui and West Molokai Association did not enter into that agreement. As there was not agreement among all of the parties, there were evidentiary hearings and briefs. The Commission filed its Interim Decision and Orders in the MPUI and WOMI cases on May 28, 2010, which adopted most of the settlement. This authorized MPUI to increase its rates on an interim basis by $542,724, or an approximate increase of 125.2%. WOMI's authorized increas e was $241,478, or an approximate increase of 222.8%. The Commission filed its Final Decision and Order in the MPUI case on September 23, 2010, which allowed the $548,682 increase that was agreed to in settlement. The final decision in the WOMI case is s till pending. It is possible that additional work may be required as the County of Maui has appealed the MPUI final decision and order and is also likely to appeal the WOMI final decision and order when it is filed. Kauai Island Utility Cooperative (\"K IUC\") 2010 Test Year Rate Case On June 30, 2009, KIUC filed an application for general rate increase (by $12,991,558 or 10.45% over revenues at present rates) and revised rate schedules and rules. During fiscal year 2009 -2010, the DCA participated in th e public hearing process, conducted extensive discovery, and submitted testimonies and supporting exhibits recommending various downward adjustments to KIUC's requested increase. After KIUC conducted its discovery and filed rebuttal testimonies, the parti es in the proceeding (KIUC, Department of Defense, Marriott, and DCA) reached an agreement on all issues and no evidentiary hearing was required. The Commission filed its Interim Decision and Order on April 29, 2010. In its interim decision and order, the Commission authorized an increase of $3,063,023, or an increase of 2.0%, which reflected certain downward adjustments to the settled upon revenues. Since there were no evidentiary hearings, there was no need to file briefs, opening or closing. After the parties conducted additional analyses to address Commission inquiries, the Commission filed its final Decision and Order on September 29, 2010, which confirmed the interim increase. Maui Electric Company, Ltd.'s (\"MECO\") 2010 Test Year Rate Case On S eptember 30, 2009, MECO filed an application for approval to increase its rates (by approximately $28,190,300, or 9.7%, over revenues at current effective rates) and to amend its rules. In fiscal year 2009 -2010, the DCA, among other things, participated i n the public hearing, conducted inspections and witness interviews, and filed testimonies and exhibits recommending various recommendations to HELCO's request. As the only two parties to the docket, MECO and DCA were able to reach a stipulated settlement that was submitted to the Commission in lieu of proceeding to an evidentiary hearing. The PUC filed its Interim Decision and Order on July 27, 2010, approving approximately $10,296,200 in additional revenues, or a 3.28% increase over revenues at current e ffective rates for a normalized 2010 test year. The PUC's Interim Decision and Order adopted most of the provisions submitted by the parties, but included additional downward adjustments for certain items. The parties await the final decision and order. Hawaii Electric Light Company, Co.'s (\"HELCO\") 2010 Test Year Rate Case 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Consumer Advocacy (DCA) - 26 - On December 9, 2009, HELCO filed an application for approval to increase its rates (by approximately $20,934,500, or 6.0%, over revenues at current effective rates) and to amend it s rules. The DCA, among other things, participated in the public hearing, conducted discovery, inspections and witness interviews, and filed its testimonies and exhibits that recommended various adjustments to HELCO's requested increases. As the only two parties to the docket, HELCO and DCA were able to reach a stipulated settlement that was submitted to the PUC in lieu of proceeding to an evidentiary hearing. The PUC filed its Interim Decision and Order on November 3, 2010, which adopted most of the provisions submitted by the parties, but included additional downward adjustments for certain items and required HELCO to file revised schedules that illustrate the resulting revenue requirements that reflect the PUC's additional adjustments. The re -calculat ed increase approximates $5,157,000, or about a 1.46% increase. The PUC has created the opportunity for HELCO to file additional testimonies and support in December 2010 to reclaim some of the monies associated with the downward adjustments made by the PUC. The DCA will need to file a response to those additional testimonies and then the parties will await the PUC's final decision and order. Small water and wastewater rate cases In addition to the rate cases listed above, the DCA provided analysis and recommendations to the PUC for other public utility rate cases during the fiscal year 2009- 2010, each of which involves analysis and preparation that spans six to eleven months: Kapalua Water Company, Ltd.; and Hawaii Water Service Company. Generic and Other Proceedings Feed -in Tariff Investigative Proceeding On October 24, 2008, the PUC initiated an investigation of the implementation of feed- in tariffs for the HECO Companies. Included in the Energy Agreement signed by the Governor, the Depart ment of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism, the HECO Companies, and the DCA on October 20, 2008, is a commitment by the HECO Companies to implement feed -in tariffs \"to dramatically accelerate the addition of renewable energy from new sources\" and to \"encourage increased development of alternative energy projects.\" (Energy Agreement, summary, at 3.) T o expe dite the process, the PUC direct ed the HECO Companies and the DCA to submit to the PUC a joint proposal on feed- in tariffs that addresses all o f the factors identified in the Energy Agreement within sixty days of the date of this Order. During the fiscal year 2008- 2009, the DCA filed a Joint Proposal on Feed -in Tariffs, issued and responded to numerous information requests, prepared and filed a statement of position, participated in technical meetings and an evidentiary hearing, and prepared and filed post -hearing briefs. On September 25, 2009, the PUC issued a Decision and Order in the proceeding, establishing several policy principles to further guide the development of a set of feed- in tariffs. The DCA participated in various technical meetings to further clarify the parties' positions and also participated in the development of the actual initial FIT rates for 2 of the 3 defined tiers. The PUC approved the tier 1 and 2 rates and the web site serving as the intake source for FIT applications were opened in November 2010. Additional work will be required to develop the Tier 3 rates and to evaluate the effectiveness of the FIT program and rates. Decoupling Investigative Proceeding 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Consumer Advocacy (DCA) - 27 - On October 24, 2008, the PUC initiated a proceeding to investigate the implementation of a decoupling mechanism for the HECO Companies, pursuant to the recommendation of the signatories to the Energy Agreement. G enerally, decoupling is a regulatory tool designed to separate a utility's revenue from changes in energy sales. During the fiscal year 2008- 2009, the DCA developed an initial decoupling proposal, filed a joint proposal with the HECO Companies, issued and responded to numerous information requests, and participated in technical meetings and an evidentiary hearing. The DCA also prepared and filed post -hearing briefs and responded to the PUC's information requests. The PUC filed an Order on February 19, 2010 that approved the joint proposal submitted by the DCA and the HECO Companies and required the production of a proposed decision and order for the PUC to approve. This proposed decision and order was filed on March 23, 1010, and the PUC filed its final decision and order on August 31, 2010. The actual implementation of decoupling has been made contingent on the PUC being able to approve electric rates that reflect a return on equity that has been adjusted for decoupling. The PUC has not yet filed a decision and order in any of the HECO Companies' rate cases with a return of equity adjusted for decoupling. HECO' s Outage Proceeding On Friday, December 26, 2008, an island- wide power outage occurred on Oahu. By Order filed on January 12, 2009, the PUC initiated an investigative proceeding to, among other things, examine the performance of HECO before, during, and after the power outage. The DCA and its engineering experts participated in technical meetings with HECO and its expert consultants and revi ewed the reports and data supplied by HECO and its consultants. The DCA also attended additional technical meetings with HECO and its experts and issued information requests to further understand the technical details of the generating units and the proce dures used to operate the system before, during, and after the power outage. The DCA filed its Statement of Position on January 14, 2010, observing that HECO could not have reasonably avoided the outage and reduced the restoration time, but made various r ecommendations to improve HECO's system and procedures to possibly minimize the likelihood of future outages and the time required to restore service. There were additional discovery between the parties and discussion. HECO filed its reply statement of p osition on April 5, 2010. The parties await the final decision and order. Depreciation rates for the HECO Companies MECO, HELCO, and HECO have filed applications seeking to modify the depreciation rates used for financial and ratemaking purposes on S eptember 9, 2009, November 9, 2009, and March 29, 2010, respectively. All of the companies are proposing depreciation rates that will lower the recorded expenses. As a result of contracting issues, the DCA was not able to process the applications request ing decreases in MECO and HELCO's depreciation rates before the completion of the DCA's analysis in the MECO and HELCO rate cases. However, the DCA was able to reach an agreement with MECO and HELCO to allow the lower depreciation rates proposed by MECO a nd HELCO to be used in the rate cases to allow the benefits to be experienced by ratepayers sooner rather than later. The DCA conducted discovery in each of the cases and submitted testimonies and exhibits in each of the proceedings in November and Decemb er 2010. The Companies are seeking to file rebuttal testimonies and have expressed an interest to discuss settlement to avoid having an evidentiary hearing. Hawaiian Telcom Reorganization 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Consumer Advocacy (DCA) - 28 - On January 4, 2010, Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. and Hawaiian Telcom Services Company, Inc. (collectively referred to as \"HT\") filed an application seeking Commission approval of its bankruptcy and reorganization plan. This application was made necessary due to HT's inability to make its debt interest payments. After gett ing approval of a reorganization plan and refinancing from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, HT filed its application with the PUC and also filed an application with the Federal Communications Commission. After conducting discovery and analysis, the DCA filed it s statement of position on May 26, 2010. In its statement, the DCA found that the transaction was in the public interest but made several recommendations to better protect the consumers of HT's regulated services. HT filed its reply and the PUC filed its Decision and Order on September 22, 2010 and generally adopted all of the DCA's recommendations with the additional of certain other conditions. Due to the nature of the Bankruptcy Court's ruling, as well as the presence of various creditors, HT needed t o confirm that the conditions would not cause a rejection of its reorganization plan. HT made its compliance filing in November 2010 and has emerged from bankruptcy. Clean Energy Scenario Planning On May 14, 2009, the PUC filed an order opening an investigation into amendments into integrated resources planning. This order is consistent with one of the commitments agreed to by the State and the HECO Companies as part of the clean energy initiative. There is a perceived need to improve upon the proce sses related to long -term energy planning to include, at a minimum, more transparency yet ensure that the proceedings move along expeditiously to allow the plans developed as a result of the procedures not becoming stale. The DCA participated in workshops , discovery, and filed its preliminary statement of position along with the other various entities in this proceeding, such as the HECO Companies, KIUC, Life of the Land, DBEDT, and Blue Planet, to name a few. Subsequently, there was additional discovery and workshops, and final statements of position were filed on or about December 21, 2009. There were panel hearings held on various days in February 2010. After the transcripts of the panel hearing were received, the parties filed their opening and reply briefs during the months of August and September 2010. Due to the complex nature of this proceeding, the PUC may ask additional discovery or require additional procedural steps, but as of the end of 2010, there are no more procedural steps, other than the PUC's final decision and order. Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standards On March 8, 2010, the PUC filed an order initiating an investigation to establish energy efficiency portfolio standards, consistent with Act 155, Session Laws of Hawaii 2009. One of the main objectives of this investigation is to determine how to comply with Act 155, which requires that Hawaii be able to demonstrate that, by 2030, 4,300 gigawatt hours of electricity have been saved as a result of energy efficiency measures. In 20 10, the DCA participated in various workshops before participating in an informal discovery process and exchanged its informal statement of position with other entities in the proceeding that include, but is not limited to, DBEDT, the HECO Companies, KIUC, Blue Planet, and R.W. Beck (the public benefits fund administrator). A number of other procedural steps remain before the PUC is expected to file its final decision and order in this proceeding. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Consumer Advocacy (DCA) - 29 - Advocacy through Participation on Committees and Boards Enhanced Wireless 911 Services The DCA has been an active participant in the State's implementation of an order issued by the FCC mandating that enhanced 911 (\"E -911\") services be provided by wireless telecommunication carriers. The passage of Act 159 (SLH 2004) provided the framework to implement the State's wireless E -911 system to route emergency calls to emergency responders along with the wireless callers' identification and location. Act 159 (SLH 2004) also established a Wireless Enhanced 911 Boa rd that oversees the collection and distribution of money collected by the E -911 special fund. As a member of the board, the Executive Director of the DCA has continued to be an active participant in the implementation of this system which is critical to the public safety of both Hawaii residents and visitors. One Call Center Advisory Committee The Executive Director of the DCA is also a member of the One Call Center Advisory Committee, which makes recommendations to the PUC regarding the implementati on of Chapter 269E, Hawaii Revised Statutes (Act 141, SLH 2004). This advisory committee was integral in developing the request for proposals for a vendor to operate this \"call -before -you-dig\" system. The system, which was operational on January 1, 2006, will reduce the risk of critical services being disrupted because utility systems were inadvertently damaged due to excavation work conducted in areas where the systems are placed in underground facilities. This will ensure greater public health and safe ty, and ultimately save excavators time and money. Hawaii Energy Policy Forum The University of Hawaii convened the Hawaii Energy Policy Forum in 2002 to help develop and promote a vision for Hawaii's energy future. It is a collaborative effort that brings together interested stakeholders including representatives of electric utilities; oil and synthetic natural gas suppliers; environmental groups; the renewable energy industry; State legislature; federal, State, and county government agencies; the business community; and other major energy consumers. The Forum's efforts focus on many different energy related issues, including social and cultural issues, energy conservation and efficiency, and regulatory reform. The DCA believes that as a participant in the forum it has and will continue to effectively represent consumers' views as major policy issues are discussed and as proposals are developed and implemented. Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative On January 31, 2008, the State of Hawaii and the United S tates Department of Energy (\"U.S. DOE\") launched the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative (\"HCEI\"), an agreement, which among other things, established for the State a goal of 70% clean energy resource use by 2030. The State and the U.S. DOE formed various comm ittees designed to examine differing aspects of the State's energy use - transportation, electricity, energy efficiency, etc. The DCA is participating in the HCEI's Integration Committee, which, with the aid of U.S. DOE experts, seeks to consolidate the t hemes and suggestions put forth by the remaining committees. As part of HCEI, the Executive Director of DCA also participates in the Steering Committee, which deals with the high level planning associated with various aspects of the technical committees t hat are 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Consumer Advocacy (DCA) - 30 - analyzing various areas (electricity, end -use efficiency, transportation, fuels, outreach) that are expected to be integral to the success of HCEI. The DCA also participates in the Technical Advisory Group (\"TAG\") that is responsible for evaluatin g the energy efficiency process that has been transitioned from the HECO Companies to a third - party administrator. As part of this process, the TAG currently meets on a quarterly basis and evaluates various aspects of the measures being implemented to hel p plan, evaluate, and implement energy efficient programs in the service territories of the HECO Companies. Using the monies collected through the Public Benefits Fund surcharge, the TAG evaluates the use of the monies to help Hawaii's efforts to reduce i ts over-reliance on imported fossil fuels. Education and Outreach During the past year the DCA has continued to focus on expanding its education and outreach activities. This has allowed the DCA to increase its ability to educate consumers and extend its reach into communities throughout the State. The DCA continued distributing its newsletter at public fairs and festivals throughout the State, and has vastly increased its electronic distribution list during the 2009-2010 fiscal year. DCA targets thos e events most likely to produce consumers interested in utility and conservation matters, increasing the overall number of consumers reached. The DCA also used other communications tools such as press releases, its web site, and other in -house produced publications to reach the public. These tools were used to highlight various utility issues and to encourage greater participation in PUC public hearings, energy conservation and efficiency efforts, and to help consumers make wise choices when purchasing telecommunications services. Document Management System The DCA, in partnership with the PUC, developed a new docket and document management system to improve internal efficiencies and to make documents filed with the PUC available to the public in elect ronic format. This new system may be found at: http://dms.puc.hawaii.gov/dms/ . Financial Summary The CRF financial summary relating to DCA for fiscal year 2009 -2010 is as follows: Personnel Expenses Operating Expenses Total Expenses Revenues Receive d $905,326 $825,554 $1,730,880 $2,229,529 CONCLUSION The DCA will continue to prioritize its caseload to target projects and consumer issues that have the greatest impact on the ratepayers of utility and transportation services in Hawaii. In addition , the DCA is expanding its education and outreach efforts. Together, this places the program in a better position to take a more proactive approach to address specific consumer issues and to gain greater public participation in decisions that affect their public utility and transportation services. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report - 31 - DIVISION OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (DFI) website: www.hawaii.gov/dcca/dfi e-mail address: dfi@dcca.hawaii.gov OVERVIEW The Division of Financial Institutions' (DFI) Mission: To ensure the safety and soundness of state - chartered financial institutions by fairly administering applicable statutes and rules in order to protect the rights and funds of depositors, borrowers, consumers and other members of the community. DFI is charged with the supervision and regulation of all Hawaii S tate-chartered and State-licensed financial institutions, including banks, foreign banking agencies and representative offices, savings and loan associations, trust companies, financial services loan companies (both depository and non -depository), and credit unions. DFI also licenses and regulates escrow depositories , money transmitters and mortgage servicers . DFI has also begun licensing mortga ge loan originators and mortgage loan originator companies who are required to be licensed effective January 1, 2011. In supervising financial institutions authorized to take deposits, DFI works closely with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC ), the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the National Credit Union Administration. DFI was first accredited by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) in 1990 and re - accredited in 1995, 2000, and 2005. The CSBS accreditation program sets high standards for state banking regulators nationwide. DFI's status as a fully accredited agency is currently under review by CSBS due to the recently implemented employee furlough days and the restrictions on out -of-state travel for training purposes. DFI is located at 335 Merchant Street, Room 221, Honolulu, Hawaii 96813. The public may call DFI at (808) 586- send e Within DFI , there are two branches: (1) the Field Examination Branch and (2) the Licensing and Regulatory Analysis Branch, each composed of financial institution examiners and headed by its own Branch Manager. The Field Examination Branch is responsible for the on- site examination of financial institutions. Examinations, unlike accounting audits, are forward -looking reviews of factors underlying the safety and soundness of the financial institutions. For example, examiners not only evaluate existing and projected financial information, but also assess the effectiveness of management, its policies, and implementation of those policies in administe ring the institution's risk management programs and practices. The Field Examination Branch also conducts examinations of escrow depositories and money transmitters when warranted. The Licensing and Regulatory Analysis Branch is responsible for licensing activities and other regulatory approvals, the off -site monitoring program, and responding to complaints . Composition DFI is headed by the Commissioner of Financial I nstitutions , assisted by an Administrative Section consisting of the Deputy Commissioner, a specialist, a regulation analyst, and a secretarial staff headed by the Secretary of the Division. This section coordinates and facilitates activities within DFI, with other divisions, and with other state and federal agencies regarding reg ulatory and supervisory issues. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Financial Institutions ( DFI) - 32 - and inquiries. The Licensing and Regulatory Analysis Branch Manager also assists the Deputy Commissioner in administrative matters such as legislatio n, training, and budgetary items. GOALS and OBJECTIVES Division Goals . DFI's goals center on the orientation, training , and effective deployment of its Examiners. Federal programs administered by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve are regularly used for this purpose as are web -based programs provided by CSBS and the Risk Management Association. On- the-job training is also a valuable component of the training plan. DFI's goals also focus on the recruitment of new staff that will be able to effectively wo rk within the framework defining the future financial services industry. New financial service products (e.g. , reverse mortgages, negative equity automobile loans , etc.), delivery channels (e.g. , gift cards), providers (e.g., Wal-Mart) , economic conditions (e.g., the \"global credit crisis\"), regulatory changes (e.g., the Dodd -Frank Act) and the attendant opportunities and risks associated with these developments , create a radically expanded regulatory environment in which the use of new experiences and ski lls (in addition to those currently required) will be necessary to success fully accomplish DFI's mission. Objectives and Policies . As a part of the CSBS accreditation process , DFI is required to establish a strategic plan and develop policies and operati ng guidelines to achieve plan objectives. DFI's strategic plan calls for the Division to: Recognize the Continuing Need for Dramatic Change Broaden Division Focus Expand Skill Sets Identify the Client Become Totally Client Centric Improve the Speed of the Organization DFI's objectives are defined by its strategic plan and the policies to accomplish those objectives are imbedded within the Division's policy and operating manuals. Action Plan . DFI's action plan is built around its strategic plan. The timetable calls for realization of short term training related goals in a one to two year time frame with longer range goals relating to experience and recruitment in a five year time frame. Performance Measurement . DFI currently measures performan ce in two ways. The first is empirical - that is, absolute measurements based on the fiscal health and regulatory compliance of the State's DFI -regulated institutions using both regular financial and examination based measurements. The second is the meas urement of throughput at the Division - that is, how many complaints have been answered, how many applications processed , etc. The first measurement - empirical - is critical, especially in the current climate of global turmoil in the financial services industry, and demonstrates performance in DFI's key area of responsibility - to ensure the safety and soundness of Hawaii -chartered financial 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Financial Institutions ( DFI) - 33 - institutions. The second measurement, while informative , is less useful, and in many ways does not accurately refl ect either effort or results as it does not measure the complexity and changing nature of the work. It continues to be under review for possible modification or replacement. ACCOMPLISHMENTS The Banking Industry in Hawaii. The national mortgage crisis that began in 2007, evolved into a full-scale financial crisis in 2008 that continued into 2010. Unprecedented economic disruptions both nationally and globally resulted in the failure, government take -over, government -assisted acquisition, or government a ssistance of some of the world's largest financial companies ranging from the government - sponsored enterprises Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation; AIG, the nation's largest insurance company; the investment banks Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers; to a large number of depository institutions including IndyMac Bank and Washington Mutual. Despite sweeping federal legislation and regulatory actions to restore liquidity and stability to the U.S. financial system, th e number of bank failures in the U.S. in 2009 was at its highest level since 1992. Problems in the banking industry continued through 2010. While Hawaii -chartered financial institutions were not immediately impacted by the national financial market disru ptions, the increasing rate of residential mortgage loan foreclosures, disappointing business conditions sparked by precipitous declines in visitor arrivals, and falls in stock and other monetary asset values resulted in deteriorating balance sheets at a number of Hawaii financial institutions. In 2010, DFI monitored the impact of the disruptions and of numerous federal initiatives on the overall industry and on individual institutions, and actively worked with the individual institutions and the federal b anking regulators to proactively address emerging issues. Heightened supervisory oversight will continue through 2011. Implementation of New Federal Laws Continue s to Expand and Impact DFI's Regulatory Role. The Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consum er Protection Act (\"Dodd -Frank Act\") was enacted in 2010 in response to the global financial crisis and is considered the most sweeping change to financial regulation in the United States since the Great Depression. It affects almost every aspect of the U .S. financial services industry, including consumer protection; systemic risks; large, complex institutions; liquidation procedures for systemically significant financial companies; executive compensation corporate governance; propr ietary trading; hedge funds; credit rating agencies; and the structure and powers of the federal financial regulatory agencies. It has been estimated that the Dodd - Frank Act requires the federal agencies to adopt over 200 rules. In addition, a major over haul of the global capital standards, Basel III, is being proposed by the international financial regulators to strengthen capital requirements and address the risk of systemically significant institutions. DFI manages its programs and train s its staff to ensure compliance with statutes such as the Dodd- Frank Act as well as federal laws relating to money laundering, privacy for consumer financial information, and corporate governance. DFI must monitor the implementation of all federal statutes and the nu merous new rules related to those statutes as well as any changes to the Basel capital standards to determine what the impacts are on the institutions DFI regulates and supervises. DFI then develops the necessary procedures and trains its staff to effecti vely ensure compliance and the safety and soundness of the institutions DFI regulates. T he new laws, rules and regulations, the evolution of the industry, radical shifts in economic conditions and the continuous impact of key drivers such as corporate governance concerns , advances in financial service products , delivery channels , providers , and the attendant opportunities and 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Financial Institutions ( DFI) - 34 - risks associated with these developments , mandate that DFI's regulatory and supervisory roles must constantly adapt to meet the new regulatory challenges associated with the changing conditions. Supervision of the Money Transmitter Industry in Hawaii . As noted in previous reports, with the passage of Act 153 of the 2006 Session Laws of Hawaii (SLH), money transmitters were required t o be licensed by DFI on or before July 1, 2007. There are currently 39 money transmitters, operating from over 1,200 locations, licensed to do business in Hawaii , a large and diverse population attesting to the impact of this segment of the financial serv ices industry on Hawaii's consumers. In 2010, DFI Field Examination Branch staff performed examinations of four money transmitters , two of which were joint examinations with other states and performed at the licensees' principal offices outside the State o f Hawaii. One of the two out -of-state examinations also included brief reviews of the money transmitter's Hawaii branch and authorized delegate. Mortgage Broker Regulation . DFI, like many other states, has long recognized t he significant impact the mor tgage broker industry was having on Hawaii consumers and the local economy and ha d advocated for the adoption of laws to actively regulate and supervise mortgage brokers and solicitors (aka mortgage loan originators) by introduc ing bills to that effect in the 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 legislative sessions - these bills were not passed by the Legislature. Subsequent to the 2008 legislative session, the federal S.A.F.E Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (SAFE Act ) was enacted on July 30, 2008. The SAFE Act called for many of the positive regulatory provisions advocated by DFI and the Mortgage Broker Task Force over the previous years (e.g., background checks, pre -licensing testing, periodic field examinations, continuing education). Chapter 454F , Hawaii Revised Statutes - the Secure And Fair Enforc ement for Mortgage Licensing Act, as amended by Act 84, 2010 SLH , Hawaii's version of the federal statute is being implemented by DFI, with the assistance of industry participants and CSBS, the industry association for all state financial service regulatory agencies in the United States . As required by the SAFE Act, Hawaii now participate s in the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System (\"NMLS\"). This online system is designed to replace each state's existing mortgage licensing application forms, systems, and processes. Persons wishing to apply for a license, or amend , surrender/cancel or renew a license do so through NMLS. Hawaii's new program expects to process applications to license more than 1,000 federal and State S AFE Act compliant local and national mortgage loan originators, mortgage loan originator companies and branches before the current January 1, 2011 deadline established by the federal statute. Mortgage Servicer Regulation . DFI introduced a bill in the 2009 legislative session to regulate servicers of residential mortgage loans secured by real property located in Hawaii to ensure that the servicers conduct those activities responsibly and with the requisite accountability to borrowers. Regulation of this industry was viewed to be necessary in light of the anticipated wave of foreclosures impacting homeowners in Hawaii. The bill was signed into law as Act 106, 2009 SLH , however the Legislature established a delayed effective date of July 1, 2010. Non -exem pt mortgage servicers were required to be licensed by DFI effective on or before that date. While consolidation in the mortgage servicing industry indicated an initial estimate of approximately 20 mortgage servicers that would be licensed under this new l aw, as of November 2010, DFI had licensed a total of 53 mortgage servicers, with belated applications still being received. Continued Development of DFI's Emergency Preparedness Program . DFI continues to develop, implement, and rehearse multiple level emergency preparedness contingency plans. Maintaining and safeguarding the adequate supply of currency to the public as well as efficient access to deposit accounts is the main objective of these plans. As the overall State of Hawaii coordinator for financial institutions 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Financial Institutions ( DFI) - 35 - operating in Hawaii, DFI is a strategic partner in HawaiiFIRST, a financial industry business continuity planning coalition established to address Homeland Security issues affecting the local financial industry, to develop and maintain re lationships with city, county, State and federal agencies, and private industries that have an impact on the local business community, and to enhance the financial industry's capability to respond to and recover from disast ers. DFI, together with HawaiiFI RST, also continues to maintain and periodically test a statewide emergency communications plan which includes all Hawaii depository financial institutions. To ensure that DFI's staff has the ability to work remotely during emergencies, including an H1N1 pandemic, DFI has replaced nearly all of its desktop computers with laptops. The laptops, coupled with VPN access to the Department's network via a browser and wireless broadband access to the Internet, provide for establishment of remote work sites and/ or telecommuting operations in the event of an emergency, permitting the continuation of secure communication with city, county, State and federal agencies, and the private sector , to facilitate the financial industry's ability to respond to and recover fr om disastrous situations. DFI will continue to work with the State's financial institutions (primarily as a strategic partner with HawaiiFIRST) , State Civil Defense, federal regulators, the Hawaii Bankers Association, the Hawaii Credit Union League, and others to ensure that robust and comprehensive emergency preparedness plans are developed, implemented and maintained going forward. Reaccreditation . DFI is accredited by CSBS, the industry association for all state financial service regulatory agencies i n the United States. CSBS administers its national accreditation program for state financial service regulatory agencies to ensure that the management and staff of these agencies are knowledgeable, appropriately organized, staffed, funded and trained to c arry out their responsibilities, which include the authorizing, regulating and supervising of state -chartered financial institutions. DFI was originally accredited by CSBS in 1990. Each year thereafter, DFI has been required to file a comprehensive repor t on the Division's activities, which is evaluated by CSBS, to retain the Division's accredited status for another year. Every 5 years the CSBS staff visits DFI on site in Honolulu to conduct an exhaustive review of every facet of the Division's operations; interview man agers, supervisors and staff; and evaluate the overall effectiveness of the program. DFI underwent such an examination in March of 2005, and received reaccreditation in late 2005. DFI was scheduled for an on- site reaccreditation review in December 2010, however, DFI has been working with CSBS to determine whether the employee furloughs and other spending restrictions will result in possible DFI accreditation probation, suspension or revocation, and what the impact any of these actions woul d have on an on- site reaccreditation review. Accordingly an on-site review has not yet been scheduled. Bank, Financial Services Loan Company, and Escrow Depository Examination Programs . Until the furloughs that were imposed in the final quarter of 2009, DFI continued to expand its role in conducting examinations of banks and depository financial services loan companies. This expanded role not only was necessitated by cutbacks in federal agency examination staffing and the addition of new State -chartered and intra-Pacific banks to the Hawaii market, but is also a critical element in the CSBS reaccreditation review. Until the furlough schedule was implemented, DFI examiners took many lead roles during safety and soundness examinations, but DFI examiners have only been able to take a limited lead role in one examination in late -2010, and it is unlikely that assuming any full lead roles will be feasible until the furloughs end. DFI continued to work closely with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco an d with the FDIC in developing and coordinating the year -round examination program for Hawaii's two largest 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Financial Institutions ( DFI) - 36 - banks. In addition, DFI continued to participate in consumer compliance examinations conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and beg an participating on a regular basis in consumer compliance examination s with the FDIC. DFI also independently conducted numerous escrow depository compliance examinations and nondepository financial services loan company compliance examinations, as well a s investigations arising out of complaints. D ue to the continuing economic stresses affecting the local economy and the financial industry in 2010, DFI was involved jointly with federal agencies in monitoring progress in ongoing formal and informal supervisory actions imposed in 2009, as well as taking new supervisory actions in 2010 against various regulated institutions . The CRF financial summary relating to DFI for FY 10 is as follows: Personnel Expenses Operating Expenses Total Expenses Revenues Rec eived $1,891,653 $293,787 $2,185,440 $2,822,798 CONCLUSION During 2010, while DFI maintained its established regulatory , supervisory, and licensing programs , and devoted considerable resources to d evelop ing and implement ing the new mortgage servicer and mortgage loan originator programs , continued emphasis was directed towards responses to ongoing deterioration across all aspects of the global financial services sector. The impact of the \"sub -prime mortgage crisis\" which has now led to the current \"gl obal financial crisis\", with its attendant disruption to the normal pattern of financial services product delivery, has affected both our local economy and all financial institutions operating in the State. DFI continues to aggressively respond to these r apidly changing global and local economic conditions and pursues the active regulation and supervision of Hawaii -chartered financial institutions to preserve their safety and soundness and protect the rights of depositors, borrowers, consumers and other me mbers of the community. The DFI staff looks forward to the challenge. 2010 Complian ce Resolution Fund Report - 37 - INSURANCE DIVISION (ID) website: www.hawaii.gov/dcca/ins e-mail address: insurance@dcca.hawaii.gov OVERVIEW Insurance Division 's (ID) goal and mission is to ensure that commercial and individual consumers are provided with insurance services meeting acceptable standards of quality, equity, and dependability at fair rates by establishing and enforcing appropriate service standards and fairly administering the Insurance Code.

On November 26, 2002, the President signed into law the Te rrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA), a federal reinsurance program for acts of war and terrorism by foreign persons impacting commercial policyholders. On December 22, 2005, TRIA was extended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 (TR IEA) with several changes to the program. On December 26, 2007, TRIA was extended to 2014 by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (TRIPRA) and amended by eliminating the requirement that the act of war and terrorism be committe d by foreign persons. Nationwide, commercial policyholders have the option to purchase coverage for a federally declared act of terrorism as reinsured by the federal government. Hurricane Coverage: As a result of the discontinuation of policies through the Hawaii Hurricane Relief Fund, catastrophe modelers have developed hurricane models to be reflective of Hawaii projected hurricane losses for the purposes of insurance ratemaking.

Short and Long Term Goals of the Division: (1) Meet its s tatutorily mandated requirement; (2) Retain the ID's accreditation by the N AIC; (3) Protect policyholders by examining insurers/captive insurers to ensure financial compliance with statutory requirement s and strive for early detection of any potentially hazardous financial conditions to preserve the assets of the insurer ; (4) Increase the efficiency of the ID's operations ; (5) Address national insuranc e issues by working with other state regulators and the NAIC ; and (6) Provide and improve Internet access by the public for insurance licensees' public data and p rovide on- line processing, rate and policy form filings, information on licensing and filing r equirements , electronic payments of fees and premium taxes, and forms for licensees. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Insurance Division (ID) - 46 - Objectives and Policies Setting Forth How Goals Can and Will be Accomplished. 1. The ID will strive to meet the mandated statutory requirements for the Insurance C ode through proper personnel and case load management. 2. This accreditation of state insurance regulators is administered by the NAIC and requires state insurance departments/divisions to have and maintain adequate statutory and administrative authority as wel l as sufficient resources to effectively regulate the financial solvency of insurance companies. In order to maintain the accreditation, the ID will ensure the required level of funding in the budget for its financial surveillance resources. Also, introduce legislation for the adoption of NAIC model laws required for accreditation. 3. Protect policyholder s from insolvent insurers by continuing the timely review and detailed analysis of financial statements filed by insurers to assure their compliance with the statutory financial requirements. Perform on site financial examination at least once every five years or more frequently as necessary as required by statute. Incorporate risk assessment methodology into the examiner's financial analysis work product. 4. To increase efficiency of operations, the ID has moved to computerization and the use of the Internet. The ID developed a database named the Hawaii Insurance Division System (HIDS), which is an integrated system with the licensing module at its co re and subsystems to support t he other functions of the ID. HIDS provides better management of the large volume of transactions handled by the ID. It has greatly reduced the manual processes and has allowed for the dissemination of informa tion to the public through the I nternet. The ID has completed its HIDS enhancement project which modified existing applications and developed an Examination application. The Examination application allow s for the electronic submittal and collection of premium tax retur ns and payments. With these modifications to HIDS, continued interfaces with the NAIC and the Hawaii Information Consortium (they provide the Internet porta l for the State of Hawaii's web site), databases can be built. These interfaces will continue to improve the efficiency of the ID and provide better services and information via the web to consumers and insurance licensees. 5. The ID participates in the proceedings of the NAIC by attending i ts meeting s to address regulatory, market place , and national issues. The members of NAIC are all of the state insurance regulators. The ID is actively involved with NAIC by its membership on various committees and currently is vice chair of a committee . 6. The ID's web site all ows the public to access general infor mation on insurance, information on licensees, comparative auto and homeowners premiums, and information on how to file a complaint. Producers can now apply for a license, renew their licenses and submit appointments on- line. The ID has several projects which have created additional interfaces from HIDS to the NAIC and the Hawaii Information Consortium databases. The current interface enhancement projects include allowing producers to update contact information, continuing education providers can submit completed course credits on- line and course schedules, time and locations will be able to be found on the website . The ID worked with the NAIC to implement additional lines of filing through SERFF. 7. President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection a nd Affordable Care Act of 2010 (\"PPACA \"). The requirements of PPACA are many and specific time frames for states to meet those 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Insurance Division (ID) - 47 - requirements are set. One of these is the State option of establishing of a health exchange. The Division was awarded a $1 mil lion dollar grant from the federal D epartment of H ealth and Human Services (\"DHHS\") to study the idea of creating a health insurance exchange in Hawaii. Health i nsurance exchanges are part of PPACA and are designed to allow individuals and small businesse s to purchase federally qualified health plans written by private insurer and obtain federal subsidies. E xchange s must also provide a front end for Medicaid. The Division formed a task force to study exchange -related issues and expect s to procure at leas t one consultant to assist its effort . An important i ssue is whether the exchange can be enabled through legislation in the 2011 legislative session. 8. The Insurance Division received another $1 million dollar grant from DHHS to build a computer system tha t can report data relating to health premium rate regulation. The Division is exploring various options to meet this goal including using the National Association of Insurance Commissioner 's System for Electronic Rate and Form Filing and modifying the Div ision's current database to enable the reporting. The Division does not expect to spend the entire $1 million on this project. 9. The passage of the Nonadmitted Reinsurance and Reform Act of 2010, requires states to have in place by July 21, 2010, a working mechanism in place whereby surplus lines premium taxes are collected and distributed in a uniform manner. The Division is working with other states through the NAIC to timely accomplish this mandate. Financial Summary The CRF financial summary relati ng to INS for FY10 is as follows: Personnel Expenses Operating Expenses Total Expenses Revenues Received $4,605,862 $2,415,192 $7,021,053 $9,366,957 CONCLUSION The ID has met and continues to meet its mission and goals to maintain a secure and compe titive insurance market place for consumers. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report - 48 - OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS (OAH) website: www.hawaii.gov/dcca/ oah/ e-mail address: oah@dcca.hawaii.gov OVERVIEW As a support office under the Director's Office, the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) is responsible for conducting administrative hearings and issuing recommended decisions, for all divisions within DCCA that are required by law to provide contested case hearings under the provisions of HRS Chapter 91.

CONCLUSION The Office of Administr ative Hearings will continue to work closely with all of the Boards, Commissions, and Programs that are part of the CRF, as well as with the other DCCA divisions that are also integral parts of the professional and vocational licensing system, to ensure that cases are processed as expeditiously as possible, and that all participating entities will have access to the OAH case data base and archives of past decisions. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report - 51 - OFFICE OF CONSUMER PROTECTION (OCP) Website: www.hawaii.gov/dcca/ocp E-mail address: ocp@dcca.hawaii.gov OVERVIEW The Office of Consumer Protection (OCP) is the primary governmental agency in the State of Hawaii responsible for reviewing and investigati ng allegations of unfair or deceptive trade practices in consumer transactions. OCP is empowered by statute to enforce the state's consumer protection laws. Functionally, this means that OCP has jurisdiction over a wide range of businesses and activitie s, including both regulated and unregulated industries. OCP handles many different types of complaints, such as those involving: advertising violations, door -to-door sales, solar energy devices, gift certificates, offers of gifts and prizes, going out of business sales, charitable solicitations, refunds and exchanges, collection practices, credit sales, health clubs, towing, fine prints and motor vehicle rentals. See Table 1, Laws Enforced by OCP. OCP also provides extensive information on the Landlord- Tenant Code. OCP has adopted a number of different strategies to ensure that its mission is achieved in a meaningful and cost -effective manner. First, the staff tries to prioritize cases according to the seriousness of the violation. To help achieve thi s goal, investigations of actions that present significant consumer harm are \"fast -tracked\" for immediate legal intervention. Second, in an effort to proactively address perceived consumer problems, the office initiates investigations of problematic comme rcial practices. Third, staff persons attempt to provide as much assistance by telephone as possible, enabling a consumer to resolve their concern(s) without government intervention. Fourth, emphasis is placed on consumer and business education, through public service announcements, Consumer Dial messages, public informational forums, speaking engagements, media releases, and the dissemination of brochures. Finally, OCP partners with numerous public and private agencies to promote consumer protection thr oughout the State of Hawaii. In view of the successful implementation of these goals during the past few years, OCP will continue to focus on them throughout the foreseeable future, including during the next five years. OCP's main office is in Honolulu a t the Leiopapa A Kamehameha Building (State Office Tower) , 235 South Beretania Street, Suite 801, Honolulu, Hawaii 96813. It shares offices with the Regulated Industries Complaints Office (RICO) in Wailuku, Maui at 1063 Lower Main Street, Suite C -216 and in Hilo, Hawaii at 345 Kekuanaoa Street, Suite 12. OCP's website address is www.hawaii.gov/dcca/ocp . Its functions are divided into four basic sections: intake, investigation, landlord- tenant, and legal. Composition The Consumer Resource Center Intake Section - phone: (808) 587- 3222 The Consumer Resource Center (CRC) handles the intake of complaints for OCP. CRC is staffed by investigators who answer consumers' questions, distribute OCP complaint forms to consumers, receive written consumer complaints, and forward cases to OCP for review, closing or further investigation. In addition, a division within CRC answers telephonic requests for prior complaint history. If circumstances permit, consumers also ha ve the opportunity to visit OCP's Honolulu office to view the actual case files. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Office of Consumer Protection (OCP) - 52 - Prior to the release of any file, OCP's staff reviews its contents to ensure that legally protected private information is not disclosed. See Table 2, statistics on OCP Info rmation Requests. The Investigation Section - phone: (808) 586- 2630 OCP's investigation section receives cases from CRC and gathers evidence to determine whether violations of consumer laws have occurred. Investigators' tasks include site inspections, w itness interviews, document collection, evidentiary analysis, report writing and the service of subpoenas. See Table 3, Number of OCP Complaints Filed; Table 4, Numerical Breakdown of Dispositions of All OCP Cases; and Table 5, OCP Complaints by Subject M atter for FY 09 -10 statistics. The Landlord- Tenant Section - phone (808) operates the Landlord- Tenant Volunteer Center. The Center is s taffed primarily by OCP investigators who answer questions about landlord- tenant issues. The Landlord- Tenant Center does not represent landlords or tenants in court or provide legal advice; its role is limited to providing information regarding the particular laws relating to landlords and tenants. The office supplements this function by making available additional information on the department's 24- hour Consumer Dial Information Service, and on its website. The office also disseminates information to interested parties through its very popular landlord-tenant handbook, of which thousands are distributed each year. The Legal Section - phone: (808) 586- 2636 The Legal Section consists of staff attorneys who file civil actions against consumer law violators. Attorneys also engage in informal and formal resolution of cases prior to filing lawsuits. OCP also provides the following services: Consumer Education In an effort to enhance consumer awareness of various consumer problems, OCP continuousl y strives to promote consumer education. The office issues press releases on a variety of consumer topics, and prepares and distributes written materials to provide specific consumer information. OCP also provides consumer information through its website and its Consumer Dial Information Service, in which interested parties can call 24 hours a day and receive information on a variety of topics. In addition, OCP staff has participated in numerous educational forums in which thousands of consumers and busi ness persons have received extensive information about consumer protection in Hawaii. Neighbor Island Assistance Requests OCP staff offers assistance to neighbor islanders in DCCA related matters or other areas, as is reflected in the attached Table 6. In addition, the office's neighbor island staffs have been trained in the technical operation of the state's Video Conference Center equipment and provide technical assistance to the department's hearings office so that neighbor island administrative hea rings can be conducted through video conferencing. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Office of Consumer Protection (OCP) - 53 - GOALS AND OBJECTIVES During the next five years, OCP will strive to fulfill its statutory mandate by fostering a fair and safe marketplace for consumers and businesses alike. In this regard, it will cont inue to investigate allegations relating to unfair or deceptive trade practices, enforce Hawaii's consumer laws, and educate consumers and businesses on their respective rights and responsibilities. The specific goals and objectives will include: Maintai ning fiscal responsibility on behalf of DCCA/OCP; Support innovative legislation designed to protect the citizens of the State of Hawaii; Proactively initiate cases against problematic business practices before there is widespread consumer harm; Dissem inate consumer education to the largest possible populace; Facilitate the exchange of information to a wide array of law enforcement; Develop access to investigative data bases; and Provide in- house training to OCP investigators and attorneys. ACCOMPLI SHMENTS Consumer Education During the past several years, OCP has educated tens of thousands of citizens by conducting workshops for senior care providers, speaking to business leaders and consumers regarding consumer protection and training Hawaii atto rneys and military legal assistance personnel on consumer protection law. Most recently, OCP has focused on the growing problems of identity theft and mortgage fraud by providing important information to thousands of Hawaii residents on how to avoid being victimized. Cases OCP handled significant cases in 2010 involving nearly every area of consumer protection. It filed and resolved numerous cases relating to alleged violations of Hawaii's laws governing mortgage fraud, unaccredited degree granting in stitutions, identity theft, gift certificates, car rentals, credit practices, marketing protection, living trusts, door -to-door sales, refund and exchanges, and unfair or deceptive trade practices. OCP's involvement successfully resulted in recovering app roximately 1.3 million dollars from respondents for having engaged in alleged unfair or deceptive trade practices and approximately one half million dollars in restitution for Hawaii consumers. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Office of Consumer Protection (OCP) - 54 - LEGISLATION OCP testified and provided input on virtually every measure relating to consumer protection at the Hawaii Legislature, including those relating to mortgage fraud, gift certificates, and credit practices. The CRF f inancial summa ry relating to OCP for FY 10 is as follows: Personnel Expenses Operatin g Expenses Total Expenses Revenues Received $1,180,258 $111,882 $1,292,140 $747,231 CONCLUSION OCP continues to receive a large number of requests for assistance. Consumer complaints are diverse in nature and range from an isolated case to problems that affect every Hawaii citizen. Through regular training and information exchange, OCP's staff attempts to keep abreast of the latest consumer problems and \"rip- offs,\" in order to prevent them from occurring and to limit their impact. Through its efforts in taking proactive measures to prevent wide -scale consumer problems before they occur, and through its enforcement actions and consumer and business education, OCP strives to meet the consumer protection needs of this community, and fulfill its mission. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Office of Consumer Protection (OCP) - 55 - Table 1: Laws Enforced by OCP HRS \u00a7209 -9 Price Gouging HRS \u00a7290 -11 Towing HRS \u00a7437 Motor Vehicle Sales - Spot Delivery HRS Chapter 437D Motor Vehicle Rental HRS Chapter 446 Debt Adjusting HRS Chapter 446E Unaccredited Degree Granting Institutions HRS Chapter 457G Occupational Therapists HRS Chapter 467B Charitable Solicitations HRS Chapter 476 Credit Sales5 HRS Chapter 477E Fair Credit Extension HRS \u00a7480 -2 Unfair and Deceptive Acts or Practices6 HRS Chapter 480D Collection Practices7 HRS C hapter 48E Mortgage Rescue Fraud Prevention Act HRS Chapter 480F Check Cashing HRS Chapter 481A Uniform Deceptive Trade Practice Act HRS Chapter 481B Unfair and Deceptive Practices, including Unsolicited Goods; Commercial Mail Order Buying Clubs; Offers of Gifts or Prizes; Aid to Handicapped; Refunds and Exchanges; Solar Energy Devices; Sales of Computers; Sensitivity Awareness Group Seminar; Credit Repair Organizations; Gift Certificates; Ticket Sales HRS Chapter 481C Door -to-door Sales HRS Chapter 48 1D Going Out of Business Sales HRS Chapter 481F Sale of Fine Prints HRS Chapter 481H Water Treatment Units HRS Chapter 481K Assistive Technology Warranty Act HRS Chapter 481L Motor Vehicle Lease Transactions HRS Chapter 481M Rent -to-Own HRS Chapter 4 81P Telemarketing Fraud Prevention Act HRS Chapter 481 X Service Contracts HRS Chapter 486N Health Clubs HRS \u00a7487 -5 Laws Enacted and Rules Adopted for the purpose of consumer protection8 HRS Chapter 487A Plain Language Law HRS 487J Social Security Num ber Protection HRS 487H Notification of Security Breaches HRS 487R Destruction of Personal Information Records HRS Chapter 506 Reverse Mortgage Loan HRS Chapter 521 Landlord Tenant Code9 5 HRS \u00a7476- 31.

65 - PROFESSIONAL AND VOCATIONAL LICENSING DIVISION (PVL) website: hawaii.gov/dcca /pvl e-mail address: pvl@dcca.hawaii.gov OVERVIEW The Professional and Vocational Licensing Division (PVL) is responsible for implementing the licensing regulations for forty -seven (47) different professions and vocations. Twenty -five (25) licensing regulatory boards and commissions are administratively attached to DCC A/PVL, as well as twenty -two (22) licensing programs (those without a board or commission). The division provides staff support to the licensing regulatory boards, handles applications , licenses, review s and processes renewals , and maintains license records. The division provides guidance for proper implementation of the licensing laws and administrative rules for the forty -seven (47) licensing areas. Additionally, PVL responds to phone inquiries on whether a person or entity is pr operly licensed. This is a service that can assist consumers in making a decision on whethe r or not to utilize the services of the person or entity . PVL's project s to promote accessibi lity for licens ing information on the Internet are very user friendly. PVL continues to explore ways to enhance public accessibility to licensing information, the licensing process, and the licensee roster. PVL's web page, a site that provides general licensing information for all 47 licensing areas, features downloadable license applications, publications, links to Hawaii Revised Statutes and Hawaii Administrative Rules, as well as a means to request an application or contact the board or program staff via e -mail. The website address is http://hawaii.gov/dcca /pvl. The website also includes a Geographic al Report of cur rent licensees by licensee type, by island, and by type of entity. It is updated regularly to reflect the number of current licensees who have been issued licenses by PVL. It is a useful tool for those who are interested in the breakdown of licensees by their professions and their geographic locations. Public accessibility to licensee information is enhanced by the PVL's License Search and List Builder sites, both of which a re fully interactive site s. The License Search site enables the public to obtai n basic information about businesses and individuals that hold professional and vocational licenses issued by PVL including license ID number, whether the license is active or inactive, current status, original date of licensure, expiration date of licensu re, current and former persons/businesses/tradenames, information on \"conditional license\" codes and descriptions, and any formal disciplinary action information against the licensee. The List Builder site enables the public t o access and order a licensee roster online. The roster may be ordered by license number, license name , and other identifying public information. Lists are available for download within twenty -four (24) hours of making the request. Updates to the online information to both sites oc cur within thirty ( 30) minutes of the update to the PVL licensing database. Feedback received on the se sites indicates that the site s benefit a wide range of users, including consumers, licensees, employers, and government agencies, both in Hawaii and out -of-state. Links to other DCCA sites provide easy access to additional useful consumer information, such as a licensee's complaints history. The website address for PVL's Online Services is http://hawaii.gov/dcca/pvl/e_services . This is the tenth year that online renewals are being made available to licensees. This entirely paperless process enables licensees to complete, file, and pay for their license renewals electronically. A fair share of renewals are still mailed in by licensees and manually pro cessed by PVL, but by far, a majority of the renewals are done online . Online renewals are available at http://hawaii.gov/dcca/pvl/e_services . 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Professional and Vocational Licensing Division (PVL) - 66 - Finally, with regard to fiscal matters, PVL's goal is to maintain the division as a special -funded and entirely self -sufficient program. Through careful budgeting of PVL revenues and expenditures, PVL endeavors to maintain self -sufficiency, while expanding and improving services to the public. Internally, PVL continues to evaluate and reengineer its processes for efficiency and streamlining, and to develop alternative means of delivery of licen sing information to the public. PVL is located at 335 Merchant Street, on the third floor of the King Kalakaua Build ing, Honolulu, Hawaii 96813. Composition PVL is divided into four branches: Licensing Branch (Phone 586- 3000) is comprised of the Applications Section and the Records Section. The Applications Section assists with the review, processing, and issuing of applications for licensure and maintains records of licensing applications. The Applications Section staff, on behalf of the boards, commissions, and programs, conducts highly intensive reviews of all initial licensing applications, determines the status of such applications, and, in some instances, makes the final determination to either issue or defer issuing licenses. The Applications Section also performs customer service duties by answering the main public call -in line of the division. The Reco rds Section is responsible for renewing licenses and maintaining records of all licensees. The Records Section staff is also involved with performing customer service duties by assisting the public with licensing information at the walk -in counter. Both sections of the Licensing Branch utilize the PVL computerized licensing database to provide immediate information pertaining to applicants and licensees. Inquirers may obtain information on whether a person or entity is licensed, the original date of lice nsure, the current status of licensure, the expiration date of the license, Hawaii disciplinary sanctions imposed on the licensee, and, if applicable, whether mandatory insurance (e.g., workers compensation, liability insurance) is current and in effect . Examination Branch (Phone 586- 2711) arranges for the administration of licensing examinations on behalf of the boards, commissions, and programs, confirms the validity and reliability of exams, revises board constructed examinations to ensure their continued validity and reliability, and advises boards, when necessary, on the technical aspects of examinations. In addition, the Examination Branch transmits and verifies to various testing organizations the eligibility information of applicants seeking licens ure in Hawaii who have been deemed approved to sit for the examination. The Examination Branch also oversees that the approved applicants are provided the necessary pre -examination information and generates and provides the applicants their post -examinati on score reports. Moreover, the Examination Branch reviews and processes requests by applicants for special examination accommodations with regard to the Americans with Disabilities Act. In addition, the Examination Branch maintains the examination recor ds for applicants and licensees. Administration Branch (Phone 586- 2690) serves as the liaison between the dire ctor of the department and the twenty -five ( 25) boards , commissions , and twenty -two ( 22) regulatory programs administratively attached to DCCA. On a daily basis, the Administration Branch (comprised of a professional staff of a Staff Attorney, Executive Officers, Program Specialists, and Secretaries) handles board affairs such as the coordinating, preparing, facilitating , and recording of board m eetings; ensuring board compliance with applicable laws that guide and direct their conduct; and implementing board decisions on applications, policies and procedures, and disciplinary actions. The Administration Branch also responds to requests for inter pretation of the licensing laws and rules; oversees licensing and 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Professional and Vocational Licensing Division (PVL) - 67 - examination activity; and guides and assists with regulatory compliance issues. The same activities are done for the twenty -two (22) programs (absent the necessity of board meetings) on behalf of the director of the department. There are also substantial coordination and facilitation activities performed by the Administration Branch with other state, county, and federal agencies involved with licensing and regulatory issues. Real Estate Br anch (Phone 586- 2643) serves as the liaison between the director of the department and the Real Estate Commission, and performs the same functions as the Administration Branch for real estate licensing and regulation and condominium property regimes. With the largest volume of applicants, licensees, and registrations, the Branch (comprised of a professional staff of a Supervising Executive Officer, an Executive Officer, Real Estate Specialists, Condominium Specialists, Secretarial and Clerical staff) admin isters the Real Estate Recovery Fund, Real Estate Education Trust Fund, and the Condominium Education Trust Fund. The Branch also administers education and research programs in the field of real estate and condominiums. Information on the programs, financial reports, and the Commission's annual report may be reviewed at the Branch's website: http://hawaii.gov/hirec . In summary, all Branches within PVL work toward efficient and expedient processing of applicat ions, licenses, and renewals to ensure the public has choices amongst competent and licensed practitioners. For a statistical summary of PVL key activities, see Table 1: PVL Statistical Overview; Table 2: Total number of Current PVL Licensees; Table 3: Total N umber and (Percentage) of License s Renewed Online; and Table 4: Total Number of Email Inquiries. Accomplishments and Performance Measures This year additional improvements were made to existing PVL online systems and its website as follows: New license types were added to the online renewal system which included Travel Agency (active and inactive), Uniform Athlete Agent (active), Private Detective (active and inactive), Private Detective Agency (active and inactive), Guard (active and inactive ), and Guard Agency (active and inactive). In addition, in December 2009, inactive online renewal forms were added for the following licensing areas: Activity Desk, Audiologist, Barber, Barber Shop, Beauty Operator, Beauty Shop, Beauty Instructor, Hearin g Aid Dealer and Fitter, Naturopath, Pharmacist, Pharmacy, Pharmacy - misc. permit, and Pharmacy - wholesale prescription drug distributor. In June 2010, inactive online renewal forms were also added for the following licensing areas: Licensed Social Wor ker, Licensed Clinical Social Worker, Massage Establishment, Massage Therapist, Nursing Home Administrator, Psychologist, Psychologist - industrial, and Veterinarian. A new webpage for the soon to be established Respiratory Therapist (RT) Program was adde d to the division's webpage. The licensure of respiratory therapists will be effective July 1, 2011. The webpage includes contact information, important announcements, and the RT statute. The application form will soon be available on the RT website. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Professional and Vocational Licensing Division (PVL) - 68 - Significant Online User Activities In pursuing the division's objective of improving and expanding customer online service s, PVL saw the number of online renewals increase for businesses and professionals. In FY 10, the online renewal user rate was 82.81%, while the corresponding FY 08 biennial renewal user rate was 76.48%, resulting in a 6.33% increase in the user rate. In FY 09, the online renewal user rate was 81.29% while the corresponding FY 07 biennial renewal user rate was 67.71%, resulting in a 13.58% increase in the user rate. PVL continued its Customer Appreciation Credit (CAC) by offering licensees a 25% CAC discount through FY 10 online renewals. At the end of FY 10, total savings to licensees was $787,039. In FY 09, the total savings was $ 553,440; in FY 08, the total savings was $689,983. In FY 07 and FY 06, a 10% CAC discount was offered. In FY 07, the total savings was $109,024 and in FY 06, the total savings was $188,140. Since the inception of the CAC in FY 06 through FY 10, total sav ings for licensees that renewed online amounted to $2,337,255. The CAC discount was designed to serve as an appreciation to PVL licen sees who used the online system and as an incentive for more licensees to adopt the online renewal process . The performanc e of this project will continue to be measured by the ability to afford the CAC discount to all licensees and by seeing an increase in our online renewal user rate. PVL continued to absorb transaction fees that otherwise would have been passed on to lice nsees who used the online renewal system. With the online system, licensees were provided the ability to pay by Echeck and by credit card, all of which were related service fee items charged by our online system provider. However, instead of charging our licensees these transaction fees, PVL continued to bear the costs by using our online renewal revenue to pay the online vendor. For FY 10, PVL bore a $381,122 transaction fee cost. The total to -date transaction fee cost borne by PVL since the inception of the online renewal system (FY 01) is $1,749,929. For PVL 's License Search online system, t here were 3,345,822 \"hits\" during FY 10. This service is a very popular, valuable, and useful tool for those who want information on licensees . The public can check to see if a licensee is currently licensed and find out if there are any formal disciplinary actions against the licensee, in addition to other pertinent information. Significant Branch Activities The Examination Branch worked with numerous testi ng organizations and national board associations on the review and processing of requests for special testing arrangements regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act. There is a high level of sensitivity in efforts to balance the needs of the applicant and the need to protect the integrity of the examinations. In addition, several testing agencies developed new processing procedures that, in turn, impacted the Examination Branch's procedures. Internal procedures and instructions were modified accordin gly with close coordination with other PVL staff such as the Executive Officers and Licensing Branch so all changes and transitions were as smooth and seamless as possible. Moreover, the examination results for the various licensure examinations continued to be processed and provided to applicants in a timely manner (some as quickly as within 24 hours of testing) which supported appl icants in obtaining licensure. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Professional and Vocational Licensing Division (PVL) - 69 - The Licensing Branch was able to continue reaching the high percentage rate of 90% for the t imely processing of new licenses and, moreover, was able to attain 97% on- time processing of renewed licenses even with the continued staff shortage in the Records Section. For the Real Estate Branch (REB), and in line with PVL's objectives of improving and expanding the division's online services, REB continued with its implementation of the online continuing education (CE) system which provided real estate licensees the ability to view the number of CE hours required and earned for the current licensing period, their CE history, and the ability to search for future CE courses being offered by approved CE providers. Real estate licensees may also access and print their own course completion certificates for the current and previous bienniums, whereas in t he past this was done by the CE providers. Additionally, real estate principal brokers and brokers -in-charge could monitor and view the current CE hours, CE history, and license status of all licensees associated with the brokerage. The system is updated daily and is simple to use. The Real Estate Commission (REC) concluded its meetings with the Consumer -Broker Relationships Ad Hoc Committee (CBRAHC) that had convened to review and study Hawaii's current laws and rules. A report is being drafted by the C BRAHC of its findings and recommendations for potential rule amendments. The REB/REC, with participation from industry representatives, continued its review and study of the potential impact on mandatory criminal history and background checks for licensur e and renewal. Further, through a working relationship with industry groups, the number of CE hours licensees must complete to keep their real estate licenses on an active status were increased from 10 to 20 hours. For a comprehensive report on the FY 10 matters addressed by the Real Estate Commission and the Real Estate Branch, please refer to http://hawaii.gov/dcca/real/main/reports to view their Annual Report for fiscal year ending June 30, 2010.

Hawaii Administrative Rules Activities In FY 10, amendments to the following rules were adopted: HAR Chapter 71, relating to Public Accountancy and HAR Chapter 88, relating to Naturopathy. Significant Division Activity PVL continues to make progress in its scanning and imaging project that converts existing licensing document files into electronic format. The conversion of the documents into electronic format protects and preserves historical documentation from damage or destruction. The conversion also has allowed staff to retrieve and review documents in a more expeditious manner at their desks thereby eliminating the time delay that comes with physically pulling files. This subsequently provides for more effective and timely service to our clients. However, even with the scanning of files, the hardcopy file is still sometimes required. Thus, PVL has started a massive project of reorganizing the basement of licensee files into a more efficient and logical filing system. Current ly, approximately half of the entire population of files has been reorganized. Financial Overview The CRF financial summary relating to PVL for FY 09- 10 is as follows: Personnel Expenses Operating Expenses Total Expenses Revenues Received $3,396,326 $836 ,103 $4,232,429 $4,542,231 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES (Action Plan) for FY 2011 PVL will continue to be fiscally conscious and protect our special fund so that it remains solvent to provide efficient and timely services. PVL will continue to look for other ways to enhance and improve its online systems for renewals, License Search, List Builder, and PVL's webpage to be more user friendly, informative, and efficient. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Professional and Vocational Licensing Division (PVL) - 73 - PVL has begun to convert downloadable application forms to online fillable application forms. This is a very tedious project and attention to detail is of utmost importance. There are more than 250 application forms that will be converted. PVL will continue the scanning and imaging of licensee files so that new documents for a current licensee file are added and new licensee files are scanned and will continue the reorganization of the hardcopy files. PVL will also be exploring avenues to streamline the Licensing Branch and the Examination Branch functions and services for improved oper ational efficiency. PVL will be addressing the information that is made available to the public for thoroughness and clarity in an effort to decrease the amount of inquiries that are generated. PVL will also be reviewing the timeframes for the various steps in the licensure process to ensure greater accountability and consistency in staff performance. The Real Estate Branch (REB) will continue to improve the offering and delivery of real estate prelicensing and continuing education courses to stay in line with the increase in CE hours. REB will begin to offer all real estate licensing applications in a pdf form- fillable format for easy online completion and printing. Rule making will be started for Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR) Chapter 99 for rea l estate brokers and salespersons and Hawaii Revised Statutes 514B. REB has collected, worked with industry members, and is currently drafting proposed HAR \u00a7 99 amendments. For the condominium program, REB solicited and collected suggestions from stakeho lders in the condominium community, and is currently compiling and drafting proposed rule amendments for HRS 514B. REB will further work to enhance online public access to condominium projects and AOUO registrations. The Program of Work for the Real Estate Commission and the REB also includes the development and implementation of a new registration program for condominium projects. For a comprehensive report on the FY 2010 goals and objectives of the Real Estate Branch and the Real Estate Commission, ple ase refer to http://hawaii.gov/dcca/real/main/reports to view their Annual Report for fiscal year ending June 30, 2010. PVL will continue the design phase for a new online surety system that will allow insurance companies the ability to submit liability and worker 's compensation insurance updates for contractor and pest control licensees. This has been a difficult project to move forward due to the complexity of designing a system that in the fro nt end, will verify the surety is licensed to do business in this State and is authorized to write these lines of insurance. Integration with the DCCA Insurance Division license provider database appears to provide a solution. Also, dedication of resourc es to this project has been strained because of the need to attend to other online priorities. The staff of DAGS/ICSD, who are critical to the design and subsequent development phase, face similar strain on their resources and the likelihood of reduced st affing. We remain committed however, to forge ahead. PVL will also pursue several rule amendment initiatives through the formal rule adoption process including amendments to HAR Chapter 53, relating to Fees; amendments to HAR Chapter 99, relating to Rea l Estate Brokers and Salespersons; adoption of amended rules for HAR Chapter 89, relating to Nurses; adoption of amended rules for HAR Chapter 92, relating to Optometrists; adoption of amended rules for HAR Chapter 97, relating to Private Detectives and Guards; adoption of amended rules for HAR Chapter 110, relating to Physical Therapists; and proposed new rules for Mixed Martial Arts and Respiratory Therapists. Finally, we are also hopeful we will be able to fill the remaining vacancies we have in the Rec ords Section of the Licensing Branch so that we can sustain our processing time for renewals at prior levels in 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Professional and Vocational Licensing Division (PVL) - 74 - the middle to high ninetieth percentile without the need for staff overtime. The Applications Section will continue as well, to strive to attain a higher processing time percentile for new licenses. CONCLUSION PVL continues to move ahead with its initiatives to improve accessibility to licensing services and information, and to streamline the licensing process without compromising consumer prot ection. PVL is committed to working with licensees and the public to achieve the optimum balance between thoughtful and fair regulat ion, and consumer protection. PVL is mindful of the strain on Hawaii's businesses and seeks to integrate licensing measures and procedures that will facilitate business. Ultimately, PVL's objective is to achieve and facilitate a fair mark etplace for the State of Hawaii. The PVL staff and the regulatory licensing boards of PVL continue to maintain high performance standards , uphold consumer protection, work well as a team, and be responsive to increased demands.

As the enforcement arm of the Department's professional and vocational boards, commissions and programs, RICO handles complaints, investigations and prosecutions of over forty -six (46) different professions and vocations. In addition, the office administers the state's State Certified Arbitration Program, commonly referred to as \"lemon law\" by providing an arbitration forum for consum ers with warranty -related disputes with motor vehicle manufacturers. RICO's main office is located on Oahu at the Leiopapa A Kamehameha Building (State Office Tower) , 235 South Beretania Street ( 8th and 9th Floors ), Honolulu, Hawaii 96813. The division o perates four neighbor island offices at Hilo, Kona, Wailuku and Lihue. RICO 's functions can be divided into two main categories: (1) education, information, complaint intake and alternative dispute resolution functions which are performed by the division's Consumer Resource Center, and (2) investigation and prosecution functions for the licensing boards, commissions and programs within the Professional and Vocational Licensing Division which are performed by the division's field investigation and legal branches.10 Consumer Resource Center (Education, Information, and Intake) RICO staff consists of intake investigators, field investigators, attorneys and support staff. Approximately one -fifth of RICO's full -time positions are located in the four neighbor island offices. The primary functions of the RICO branches are generally described as follows: The Consumer Resource Center (\"CRC\") handles all intake functions for RICO and the Office of Consumer Protection (\"OCP\"). With the easy to remember 587 -3222 telephone number, CRC provides an efficient means for the public to obtain consumer information, make complaint -related inquiries and submit formal complaints. Information and assistance to the public is available through telephone, facsimile and walk in contact, and through the RICO website at www.hawaii.gov/dcca/rico . CRC investig ators answer questions and educat e the public about governmental services, RICO's and OCP's jurisdictional areas, and RICO's a nd OCP's complaint processes. CRC staff also conducts p reliminary investigations of RICO complaints and forwards only those cases appropriate for further investigations or prosecution to t he other sections of RICO . Consumer -initiated complaints comprise the majority of RICO's cases. Upon receipt of a complaint, CRC will determine whether an actionable violation is involved. If so, the complaint is handled through mediation, further investigation or prosecution, or other resolution. 10 See , Section 26 -9, Hawaii Revised Statutes. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Regulated Industries Complaints Office (RICO) - 80 - Another important aspect of CRC's work is the service provided by CRC's Licensing & Business Information Section (LBIS). The LBIS is a consolidated service operated by RICO for the Office of Consumer Protection, the Business Registration Division, the Professional and Voca tional Licensing Division, and RICO . The service allows callers to use just one telephone number (587- 3222) to find out (1) basic business registration information; (2) whether a business holds a professional license; and (3) complaints history on file with RICO and OCP. Through LBIS' service, callers are able to gather important information about a particular licensee or business without having to call multiple state offices. Public access to complaints information has been significantly enhanced with the availability of the interactive Business and Licensee Complaints History search site at www.businesscheck.hawaii.gov. Consumers and businesses now have 24- hour access to current information about an individual's or business' complaints history. The s ite provides information about complaints that were filed as well as administrative or civil legal actions that were taken. The site is widely used by consumers, businesses, licensees, and credentialing organizations in Hawaii as well as in other states, and is designed to provide the inquirer with a printable complaints history report. See Table 1 for more specific information about the Consumer Resource Center. Field Investigation Branch The Investigation Branch , consisting of field investigators a nd clerical support staff, contains the largest concentration of RICO personnel statewide . With enforcement responsibility over the licensing laws of 46 different boards, commissions and programs, investigators evaluate a wide range of licensing violation s within a diverse population of licensees . See Table 2 for an overview of the number of cases by board, commission or program. In addition, both CRC and F ield staff investigate many tips, anonymous reports and other complaints from consumers, businesses and other interested parties. Field investigators are responsible for gathering evidence in RICO cases to determine whether licensing law violations have occurred. RICO's investigators also take an active part in resolving cases, and in issuing admini strative citations where unlicensed activity is observed. In many cases, field investigators will seek an independent evaluation of the case by appointed member of a board's advisory committee. Advisory committee members provide opinions about the particular practice being investigated and are helpful in determining industry standards. Once the field investigator has gathered the evidence in a particular case, the case may be referred to the Legal Section for evaluation and disposition. In addition to handling RICO complaints, the neighbor island offices within RICO's investigative section serve as liaison for the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs. This responsibility requires the neighbor island staff members to know a little bit about ever ything concerning the department. As illustrated in Table 3, neighbor island RICO offices provide the most information in areas concerning the Professional and Vocational Licensing Division and the Business Registration Division. Neighbor island staff pro vides information, forms, educational brochures, technical assistance for hearings, and assistance in the facilitation of professional and voca tional licensing examinations. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Regulated Industries Complaints Office (RICO) - 81 - Legal Branch The Legal Branch has the principal responsibility of taking dis ciplinary or civil action against violators of the statutes and rules within RIC O's jurisdiction. Upon receipt of a case, the Legal Branch will determine the appropriate course of action based upon the informa tion contained in the investigative file. Formal action may be taken by either the filing of a Petition for Disciplinary Action with the Office of Administrative Hearings (for cases involving licensees), a hearing related to the issuance of a citation, or a Complaint for Injunctive and Other Relief in circuit court (for cases involving unlicensed activity) . State Certified Arbitration Program The State Certified Arbitration Program (SCAP), more commonly known as the lemon law program, provides an arbitration forum for a consumer to resolve a warran ty-related dispute with a motor vehicle manufacturer witho ut having to hire an attorney. RICO's Legal Branch handles the administration of the State's lemon law program. Staff is actively involved in arbitrator training and in overseeing the actual arbit rations, and provides educational information to the public about the lemon law and the arbitration process. The SCAP administrator is also actively involved in representing Hawaii in the International Association of Lemon Law Administrators. See Table 4 for more specific information about SCAP case outcomes. GOALS, OBJECTIVES & POLICIES RICO has three main operational goals: to uphold a fair and safe marketplace, to provide excellent customer service, and to optim ize operational efficiency. In upholding a fair and safe marketplace, RICO activities are directed toward address ing license violations and complaints and inquiries through appropriate referral, investigation, resolution and/or prosecution and toward making regulation more effective. The division is doing this proactively through sweeps, stings and compliance checks. The division gauges performance by, among other things, the number of enforcement actions it brings and the number it completes. In providing excellent customer service, RICO activities are directed toward enabling members of the public to become knowledgeable participants in transactions w ith licensed professionals, fostering an awareness of the importance of licensure, and providing meaningful assistance and support to t he public in a user-friendly manner. The division is doing this through participation in relevant consumer fairs and shows, especially on the neighbor islands, and through additional information available online. The division gauges performance by, among other things, the amount of consumer outreach conducted (educational, fairs, neighbor island assistance, speaking engagements and telephone assistance). In optimizing operational efficiency, RICO activities are directed toward promot ing internal case handling systems and related tools and systems that aid in fair, timely and effective enforcement, and enabling (train ing) and assist ing staff in fulfilling RICO objectives and policies. The division is doing this through training for staff, adequate staffi ng, database enhancements, and streamlined report writing. The division evaluates performance by monitoring the amount of time a case is handled by each branch. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Regulated Industries Complaints Office (RICO) - 82 - ACCOMPLISHMENTS Enforcement Action: RICO continued its efforts to bring more serious disciplinary enforcement actions for the boards' review and action. In FY2010, these efforts yielded a 30% increase in the number of board orders that were issued to 214, and an increase in the number of board revocations by over 100%, from 30 to 62. Increased Medical Enforcement . RIC O continued its initiatives relating to medical licensee enforcement , resulting in Hawaii now being ranked 10 th in the nation in terms of number of serious disciplinary actions taken. Legislation : Although RICO did not submit bi lls for consideration during the 2010 legislative session, it participated in a number of bills that impact licensees. Act 5, Relating to Motor Vehicle Express Warranty. The Act amends the definition of \"motor vehicles\" in Chapter 481I, Hawaii Revised S tatutes, to include motorcycles. Act 13, Relating to Veterinary Medicine.

The new part sets forth hearing procedures for these disputes, reciprocal rights and obligations among dealers, manufacturers and distributors, requirements for the sale or transfer of franchises, and requirem ents for cancellation of franchise agreements. Consumer and Licensee Outreach: RICO continues to work with the building industry to provide contracting law information to consumers as part of a series of B uilding Industry Association presentations about remodeling issues and has participated in a number of home shows and industry group presentation s. At the same time, in response to questions from the public, RICO prepared and placed online detailed tips on what information to provide when reporting unl icensed activity and has placed its Quarterly List of Unlicensed Activity Judgments online. In addition, RICO's website now includes a link to the Department's monthly press release of professional disciplinary orders and a detailed explanation of its complaints handling process.

Rapid changes and increased complexity in the way many of the licensed professionals conduct business, as well as changes in state law have spawned new enforcement issues and new challenges for RICO. Th rough strategic initiatives, enhanced training, and a commitment to continual improvement, the division will continue its efforts to provide a fair and safe marketplace for the consumers, businesses and professionals it serves . 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Regulated Industries Complaints Office (RICO) - 85 - Table 1: RICO Consumer Resource Center 2008 2009 2010 Telephone Requests for Complaints History , License Status and Business Registration 60,473 54,950 59,423 Complaint Inquiries & 18,087 TOTAL 72,399 With RICO 2008FY 2009FY 2010FY Accountants 8 5 11 Activity Desks 23 21 37 Acupuncturists 3 4 0 Barbers & Cosmetologists 72 44 46 Boxing 0 1 2 Cemeteries and Pre-Need Funeral Authorities 1 3 4 Chiropractors 4 3 2 Collection Agencies 14 23 10 Contractors 366 397 363 Dentists and Dental Hygienists 21 18 21 Dispensing Opticians 0 2 2 Electricians & Plumbers 21 21 28 Electrologists 0 0 0 Elevator Mechanics 0 0 0 Employment Agencies 1 0 0 Engineers, Architects, Surveyors and Landscape Architects 15 26 17 Hearing Aid Dealers & Fitters 0 0 2 Marriage and Family Therapists 0 0 0 Massage Therapists 84 72 60 Medical (including Osteopathy) 63 80 49 Mental Health Counselors 1 0 0 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Regulated Industries Complaints Office (RICO) - 86 - Mortgage Brokers & Solicitors 43 24 21 2008FY 2009FY 2010 FY Motor Vehicle Industry 23 47 33 Motor Vehicle Repair 45 51 44 Naturopaths 1 4 1 Nursing 39 30 30 Nursing Home Administrators 1 1 2 Occupational Therapist 0 0 0 Optometrists 2 3 0 Pest Control 8 4 5 Pharmacy 25 15 42 Physical Therapists 2 2 2 Pilotage 0 0 0 Private Detectives & Guards 3 1 6 Psychologists 5 8 9 Real Estate Appraisers 3 4 4 Real Estate (including Condominiums) 123 181 180 Respiratory Therapists (effective 7/1/2011) -- -- 0 Social Workers 3 8 3 Speech Pathologists & Audiologists 0 0 1 Subdivision 0 0 0 Time Share 1 18 4 Travel Agencies 13 89 6 No Rules Combat (Chapter 440D repealed and replaced by Chapter 440E (Mixed Martial Arts, 7/1/2009) 40 33** 0 Uniform Athlete Agents (effective 7/1/08) 0 0 0 Veterinarians 3 7 2 1080* 1,244* 1,049* *Does not include investigations closed or referred at intake level. **Includes compliance checks. 2010 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Regulated Industries Complaints Office (RICO) - 87 - Table 3: Assistance by Neighbor Island RICO Offices in FY 2010 AGENCY HILO KAUAI KONA MAUI TOTAL Division of Financial I nstitutions 18 3 6 1 28 Business Registration 472 685 644 229 2,030 Cable Television 5 0 0 2 7 Insurance Division 44 23 59 15 141 Division of Consumer Advocacy 31 13 10 0 54 Professional & Vocational Licensing 475 415 663 328 1,881 Office of Consume r Protection 264 436 177 203 1,080 Non-Department Related 313 1,961 925 6,756 Table 4: RICO State Certified Arbitration Program (\"SCAP\") Activity TOTAL NO.
