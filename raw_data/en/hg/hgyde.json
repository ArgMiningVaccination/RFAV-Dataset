Help us stop the spread of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation There's a lot of information out there about the COVID-19 vaccines, and some of it is fake. We all have power as influencers, and it's important to make sure that the information we're spreading is based in fact. Knowing the facts How to Confirm The Facts When you're scrolling social media, you probably come across headlines that really fire you up. Before you tap \"share,\" ask yourself a few questions: - Who's saying this and can you trust them? - What's the evidence? - Do trustworthy sources back them up? It's also important to read more than a headline, even from trustworthy sources. Sites and sources need to make eye-catching headlines to make money, and there's always more to the story than one blurb. There are a few ways fake news sites try to trick you. They copy the names of real sites and change them a little to look credible and get clicks. And some posts are also ads, which means they're not neutral. They're trying to sell you something! Sometimes our own biases can get in the way too. Confirmation bias causes us to believe claims that already match how we feel. If being a vegetarian is really important to you, you might believe and share an article about the negative effects of eating meat, even if they aren't true. Even if something you read feels right, it's still important to make sure it's credible. Where to Find The Facts For more than 50 years, we've been fighting for Latinos when it comes to health care and other issues. We have a national presence, and our [Affiliates](https://unidosus.org/affiliates/) are trusted pillars of Latino neighborhoods, helping the community every day. We're working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to bring you the information you can trust about the vaccines. And you can find more information here: - The CDC's [website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html)or your [local health department](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html). - Our website at [unidosus.org](https://unidosus.org/); follow us on [Twitter,](https://twitter.com/Weareunidosus) - Follow the [COVID-19 Prevention Network](https://www.coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org/)for more information and resources in both English and Spanish. We've answered some of the most common questions about the COVID-19 vaccines, based both on information from health officials and the advice of trusted community leaders. COVID-19 Myths and Misinformation FALSE: Natural remedies against COVID-19 exist and are effective. There is NO medical evidence that natural remedies (including alcohol, garlic, herbs, spices, vitamins, and mineral supplements) help prevent or cure a COVID-19 infection. Many herbs, vitamins, and minerals play an important role in promoting health and general well-being but consuming them does not kill the COVID-19 virus and it does not prevent you from getting the virus that causes COVID-19. The best way to prevent getting very sick from COVID-19 is by getting vaccinated, washing your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds, and following the CDC's masking and physical distancing guidelines. You can learn more by reading CDC's webpage: how to protect yourself and others. FALSE: If you have been sick from COVID-19 before, you do not need to get the vaccine. If you have already been sick from COVID-19, you still need to get vaccinated. Although you develop some antibodies that help fight the virus that causes COVID-19 after you have been sick, health and medical experts do not know yet how long this protection will last and keep you from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19. Being re-infected with COVID-19 and getting very sick, to the point that you might need a ventilator to breathe, is still possible. Some of the new variants, such as Delta, are much more aggressive, so the best way to protect yourself is by getting vaccinated against COVID-19, even if you have already been infected. FALSE: COVID-19 Vaccines can harm children. No, the COVID-19 vaccine cannot harm children. The Pfizer vaccine which is approved for children 12 years old or older is safe. The Pfizer vaccine was studied in a clinical trial with more than 2,200 children between the ages of 12 and 15 years of age. During this trial the vaccine was found to be safe and effective at protecting children from getting very sick from COVID-19 virus. Some of the most common side effects reported in children include pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site, and fatigue, and body aches which lasted for a few days. Clinical trials for children under 12 are ongoing and tend to take longer because they require more safety precautions and a phased approach to ensure proper dosing. Vaccines, like many medicines, need to have the doses adjusted to the weight of younger kids. To learn more about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines on children visit the CDC's page on COVID-19 Vaccines for Children and Teens. FALSE: COVID-19 Vaccines can affect a woman's fertility The COVID-19 Vaccines does not affect fertility in either males or females. There is no evidence that any of the COVID-19 vaccines interact with our reproductive organs or affect our ability to have children. Many people have become pregnant after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, this includes women who participated in the clinical trials for all three of the currently available vaccines. A report published in June 2021 shows that 4,800 people had a positive pregnancy test after receiving a first dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. The v-safe COVID-19 Vaccine Pregnancy Registry was established by the CDC to specifically learn more about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines for people who are pregnant. You can learn more about this registry and the effects of the COVID-19 vaccine on fertility by visiting the CDC's webpage on this matter. FALSE: COVID-19 Vaccines are dangerous and can alter your DNA COVID-19 vaccines are not dangerous, and they cannot alter your DNA. All three of the available vaccines are safe and will protect you against getting very sick (needing a ventilator to breath) or dying from COVID-19. None of the currently available COVID-19 vaccines have virus that causes COVID-19, and therefore they cannot give you a COVID-19 infection. The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines use messenger RNA also called mRNA which will teach your body how to fight the virus that causes COVID-19. mRNA will not harm, change, or interact with your DNA, they simply work like \"coaches\" to teach your body how to fight the virus effectively. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine does not use mRNA, instead it uses a viral vector to create a strong immune response in your body that will recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19. The mRNA in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, or the viral vector in the Johnson & Johnson vaccine do not enter your cell's nucleus (where your DNA is stored) and therefore they do not alter your DNA. Learn more about mRNA and viral vector COVID-19 vaccines. FALSE: COVID-19 Vaccines contain a microchip or tracker that will allow governments to spy on us. No, the COVID-19 vaccines do not contain a microchip and the government is not using the vaccines to track us. There is no evidence that any of the vaccines contain any type of software or technology like a microchip that can be used to track people. Information on all the ingredients in the COVID-19 vaccines are safe and publicly available to the general public, there are no secret ingredients. Frequently Asked Questions Trusted information you can share Why are there so many COVID-19 Vaccines? COVID-19 has affected every person on the planet, and developing more than one vaccine at the same time gave all of us a better chance to get coronavirus under control. This means we need to have multiple vaccines to have COVID-19 under control. How do I know the COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, given how quickly the vaccines are being developed? As with any vaccine, all of the COVID-19 vaccines went through very intense trials and screenings before ensuring that they're safe and effective for people to get. Both the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hold any vaccine to high standards because they're given to millions of people to prevent serious diseases. Even after they vaccines have been approved for us to get, they're still being monitored. Do the COVID-19 vaccines impact fertility? There is no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines affect someone's ability to get pregnant. More tests are underway to determine how the COVID-19 vaccines affect people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or trying to become pregnant. Make sure to talk with your health care provider about your options. How often will I need to get vaccinated against COVID-19? It's still too early to say. The virus is changing and that might mean we have to get vaccinated again sometime, like with the flu. Public health experts are keeping a close eye on the virus to learn more. Can I get a COVID-19 vaccine if I am undocumented? Yes, the COVID-19 vaccines are available for the undocumented community. Public health employees should not prevent undocumented people from getting any of the COVID-19 vaccines. We know that fear is a reality for undocumented people when giving out personal information, so if you have concerns about sharing personal information, speak to allies or a local trusted source in your community, or visit [immigrationlawhelp.org](http://www.immigrationlawhelp.org/) for resources. Can I get a COVID-19 vaccine if I've had COVID-19? Yes. Even if you had COVID-19 before, you can still get one of the vaccines. We still don't know how long natural immunity to COVID-19 lasts, and it's important to protect ourselves and our loved ones. Some studies suggest that it is possible to get COVID-19 twice. If you've had COVID, it's recommended to wait at least four weeks after you completely recover to get the vaccine. If I have a chronic condition, like diabetes or heart disease, can I get one of the COVID-19 vaccines? Living with a chronic condition increases the risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, so yes, it is generally recommended to get a COVID-19 vaccine. However, if you have a chronic or underlying medical condition, it's best to have a conversation with your doctor or health care provider to make a decision that is right for you.
