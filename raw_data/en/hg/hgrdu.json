These medicinal plants have been used since ancient times in various parts of the world where access to modern medicine is limited. Medicinal plants play important role in the management of diabetes mellitus especially in developing countries where resources are limited. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Insulin deficiency leads to chronic hyperglycaemia with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Diabetes mellitus affects most of the people in both developed and developing countries. The treatment of diabetes with conventional drugs is very expensive and chances of side effects are high. Objective: The specific objective of this article is to provide a comprehensive report on on-going global efforts to discover and develop more efficacious anti-diabetic drugs with no side effect from various medicinal plants found within Nigerians rich flora, which have been shown to display potent anti-hyperglycaemic activity. Methods: Different researchers in different fields (chemistry, biochemistry and molecular biology) have employed technological developments in separation methods, hyphenated technique and high throughput assays to drive the drug discovery processes. Conclusion: Natural products identified from medicinal plants give an exciting opportunity for the development of new therapeutic agents for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Most prevalent among natural products are flavonoids, terpenoids, cardiac glycoside, alkaloids and steroids. Despite considerable progress in the development of synthetic drugs, the discovery of phytomedicine as an alternative therapy is progressing. This paper discusses the role of plant natural products in diabetes management.

Kidneys vulnerable to damage bypoisons, contamination, invulnerable responses and ischemia. Intense renal failure is a continuous complexity of basic disease particularly in the inpatient setting. The point of the present study was to assess the protective and curative effect as well aschemopreventive effectiveness of M. oleifera extract against dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) induced nephrotoxicity in rats. Rats were divided into fivegroups as follows Group (1) Control ratsgot 1 ml oral saline daily. Group (2) Renalfailure induced group. Group (3) Healthy rats got M oleifera in a dose of 200mg/Kg daily. Group (4) Rats orally treated with M oleifera in a dosage of 200 mg/kg body weight 28 days subsequent to accepting intraperitoneally dose of (DMBA). Group (5) Rats orally treated with M oleifera in a dosage of 200 mg/kg body weight 14 days before and 14 days after getting intraperitoneally dose of (DMBA). DMBA induction inspired a huge acceleration in parameters like serum urea, creatinin, protein, electrolytes, cyctatin c and 2 - Microglobulin, add up to and direct bilirubin level and MDA, with a consumption of cancer prevention agent catalysts to be specific SOD, CAT and NO. The helpful adequacy of Moringaoleifera concentrate was seen as far as standardization of changed renal oxidative stress parameters and electrolytes and both cyctatin c and 2 - Microglobulin. Explored parameters were restored, about to the ordinary qualities, after M. oleifera extract treatment. These outcomes proposed that M. oleifera concentrate could act against DMBA-impelled kidney damage in rats by a system identified with its cell reinforcement properties. So also, the oral treatment of M. oleifera, as a therapeutic effect created comparable changes to those when M. oleifera was utilized as a defensive operator, however to a lesser degree.

Opioid abuse also contributes to increased healthcare costs, which is estimated at $300 billion/year according to the White House budget office. It has been recognized that the analgesic effects and the unpleasant side effects (such as addiction, respiratory depression, and tolerance) of most therapeutic opioids are primarily due to their interaction with the mu opioid receptor (MOR). In order to counteract these negative effects, studies are underway to develop MOR antagonists. In addition to treating opioid dependence, MOR antagonists are also used in the treatment of alcoholism, and have the potential for treating a variety of other conditions such as psychosis, obesity, and Parkinsons disease. Until recently, successful receptor-based drug design was extremely difficult, because the interaction between opioid drugs and the receptors were not fully understood at the molecular level. However, since reporting the crystal structure of the opioid receptors, researchers have been able to take advantage of this knowledge to discover new compounds, which target these receptors and may be useful for pharmacological and medical purposes. The current study aims to design, synthesize and biologically evaluate potential mu receptor antagonists. The preliminary virtual high throughput screening (HTS) has led to the identification of one novel small-molecule mu antagonist.

UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London, UK Recent trends in the area of pharmaceutical products research and development appear to be directed more towards new drug delivery systems as well as new physical forms of existing APIs with enhanced properties such as polymorphs and co-crystals. Understanding the factors affecting crystallization of different polymorphic forms is highly important as good control over the conditions that produce each form is key in manufacturing pharmaceutical products. We have pioneered the use of inkjet printing to crystalise metastable polymorphic forms of pharmaceutically related materials such as mannitol, glycine and 10,11-dihydrocarbamazepine. By utilizing the unique deposition capabilities of the inkjet printing system Jetlab 4x\u00ae (Microfab Technologies Ltd, USA), droplets of size down to 100 pL were dispensed on various substrates including glass and aluminium. Phase identification was achieved by Raman microscopy, and by printing onto X-ray diffraction mounts (Micromesh, MiTeGen) powder X-ray diffraction data were collected for crystals in droplets as small as about 5 nL. It seems that the fast evaporation rate of the printed droplets prevented the conversion of metastable forms to the stable forms, which allowed their identification. For example the most unstable form of glycine ( form) was crystallised predominantly as its solvent-mediated transformation to the stable from was prevented in small printed droplets. By combining the capabilities of both inkjet printing and analytical characterization methods such as Raman microscopy and X-ray diffraction, the interesting process of crystallisation in confinement was studied where metastable forms seems to predominantly crystallise in the printed droplets. In conclusion, inkjet printing appears to provide a new approach to crystallization in confinement with great opportunities to study metastable polymorphic forms.

Role of different receptor subtypes of serotonin has long been implicated in epileptogenesis, depression, learning and memory impairments, but their role in epilepsy induced comorbidities is still unexplored. Therefore this study was envisaged to evaluate the role of different 5- HT receptors (5-HT 1A/2A/2C/3) in kindling induced depression learning and memory deficit. In this study male Swiss Albino mice were kindled using subconvulsive dose of PTZ (35 mg/kg). Once the animals were kindled they were treated with vehicle, 8-OH-DPAT (1 mg/kg/day), WAY-100635 (0.3 mg/kg/day), and ondansetron + m- CPBG for 20 days. Seizure severity score, depression like behavior, learning and memory was evaluated on day 5, 10, 15 and 20. After the behavioral evaluations on day 20, animals were sacrificed to estimate different neurotransmitters in discrete brain parts (by HPLC-FD method), nitrite level and AChE activity (microplate reader method). Ondansetron treatment significantly reduced the seizure severity score and improved the depression like behavior, learning and acquisition performance as compared to vehicle treated kindled animals. The effect of ondansetron was reversed by m-CPBG co-treatment. The neurochemical changes in the cortex and hippocampus also supported the behavioral outcome of the study. This study substantiates the role of 5HT3 receptor in PTZ kindling induced depression like behavior, learning and memory deficit in mice. This study creates a rational to explore the use of more selective 5-HT3 receptor ligands for comprehensive management of depressive behavior and memory impairment in patients with epilepsy. College of Pharmacy and Nutrition, University of Saskatchewan, Canada In spite of significant advances in recent years towards the development of new therapies, cancer is still a largely unmet medical need and the leading cause of death in industrialised countries. The main challenge in cancer therapy is the patients immune suppression leading to tumor relapse and therapeutic failure. Chemotherapy agents are often accompanied by various side effects and poor pharmacokinetics profile. Advancements in nanoparticles as novel drug carriers are rapidly progressing and offer exciting promises. Polymeric nanoparticles have been developed and characterized to enhance the efficacy of the therapies. The drawbacks and challenges of the current cancer treatments and different strategies to overcome the issues will be presented and discussed.

We investigated two modes of connectivity in regards to the pharmacophore unit position and type. The inhibitory potency of the typical active azoles ranged between 1.2->100 \u00b5M toward COX-2 enzyme. The molecular docking studies of the most potent candidates showed that they are well seated inside the active site of both enzymes COX-1 and COX-2. Our recent structure-activity relationship study of a novel set of 1,5-disubstituted tetrazoles, together with the molecular docking results, proved the importance of the introduced structural modifications of the typical azoles. These modifications included using linkers with different lengths at one of the phenyl group (OH, CH2OH, CH2CH2OH) and inserting a methylene (CH2) unit between the central motif and the other phenyl group which holds the pharmacophore unit. Our bioassay screening data showed that the azole which has the CH2 spacer, the longest linker (ethyl alcohol), and the methylsulfonyl (CH3SO2) unit has the best inhibition potency for both enzymes IC50: COX-1 = > 200 \u00b5M, COX-2 = 3 \u00b5M. Further, the molecular docking studies illustrated that this azole, our lead compound, is well seated and capable of forming strong hydrogen bonds with certain amino acid residues inside the active site of the COX-2 enzyme. In the case of the COX-1 enzyme, however, the pharmacophore unit is drafted away from the active site resulting in extremely weak or no inhibition for the house keeping enzyme COX-1. In summary, our lead compound is capable of targeting only the COX-2 enzyme, while preserving the COX-1 enzyme untouched, safe, and active.

In the present study, miconazole nitrate (MCN) was incorporated into particulate binary mixtures (PBM) using a hydrophilic polymer, poloxamer 188 (PXM), as a carrier to improve itsantimycoticactivity in comparison with the pure drug. Solvent evaporation and fusion techniques were employed to prepare series of MCN-PBMsas well physical mixtures at 1:1, 1:3, 1:5 and 1:7 ratios of MCN and PXM. MCN-PBMswere evaluated for their shape, particle size, flow ability, compressibility, mucoadhesiveness, in vitro dissolution and microbiological activity. The results revealed that a marked improvement in MCN dissolution rate was obtained from only PBMs prepared by fusion technique rather than those prepared by solvent evaporation and physical mixtures. In addition, the in vitro microbiological study showed a relevant effect where MCN-PBMsobtained by fusion method significantly enhanced inhibitory activity on yeast growth as compared to that one prepared by solvent evaporation and physical mixtures. In conclusion, the solid particulate binary mixtures prepared by fusion technique may be proposed for MCN topical applications against mycotic infections, taking advantage of the mucoadhesive and permeation enhancing properties of PXM polymer.

Stabilization of this arrangement may inhibit the further action of different enzymes involved in cancer cell immortalization. In present work, structure based drug design was carried out on crystal structures of a parallel stranded human telomeric quadruplex in complex with the monomeric parallel-stranded case of human telomeric quadruplex, the porphyrin molecules bind by stacking onto the TTA nucleotides, either as part of the external loop structure or at the 5 region of the stacked quadruplex having no direct ligand interactions with G-tetrads. This is in accord with the relative non-selectivity by porphyrin for quadruplex DNAs compared to duplex DNA. While in c-myc, promoter involves a core of three stacked guanine tetrads formed by four parallel guanine tracts with all anti guanines and a snapback 3-end syn guanine in complex with porphyrin moiety. After virtual screening some of the potential compounds were evaluated for their ability to bindand stabilise G-quadruplex structures by PCR stop assay procedure. DNApolymerase primer extension reactions were carried out using twoseparate DNA templates. One contained four repeats of the humantelomeric sequence (Quadruplex Forming, QF), Temp[TTAGGG]4 and a second contained fourrepeats of a non-G-quadruplex-forming sequence (NQF), Temp[TTAGAG]4. Primer extension reactions were conducted in the varying concentrations of porphyrin analogues. Compoundswere also evaluated for in vitro cell growth inhibition, expressed as IC50 values using MTT assay in two human tumor cell lines MCF-7 (breast carcinoma) and A549 (non-smallcell lung carcinoma). In general, all of the compounds are effective G-quadruplexstabilisers. Ligand-induced polymerase stop productsat the G-quadruplex-forming site increased upon increasing theconcentrations of ligands. The primer extension reactionsusing the non-G-quadruplex-forming Temp[TTAGAG]4had revealed no G-quadruplex stop products, which indicates that the inhibition of DNA polymerase activity using thistemplate is due to non-specific interactions of the porphyrin ligands with the DNA. It was also observed that, after comparing the inhibition of full length product formed by both quadruplex and non-quadruplex forming templates, most compounds act as non-specific inhibitors of telomerase except PYP-1 and in some extent PYP-2. The study indicates that these compounds had strong G-Quadruplex binding affinity with very good inhibitory activity in A549 cell Porphyrin Biography: Dr. D. B.

A glycoprotein called haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) at the virus envelope encompasses three key functions in virus infection and spread. The hPIV HN recognizes and attaches to sialoglycoconjugates present on the host cell and subsequently activates the fusion machinery, thereby facilitating infection. Upon virus replication, hPIV HN cleaves sialic acid from host cell receptors allowing viral spread to uninfected cells. Despite continuous efforts, neither antiviral drugs nor vaccines are approved for clinical use against parainfluenza virus to date and this reinforces the urgent need for new therapeutic discovery strategies. The viral surface glycoprotein HN represents an ideal target for the development of the urgently needed antiviral agents. We have used a multidisciplinary approach to discover designer potent inhibitors that target a novel structural feature associated with the human parainfluenza virus type 3 surface glycoprotein haemagglutinin-neuraminidase. This novel feature is the flexible 216-loop which can move to a more open form creating a cavity (the 216-cavity) that can be occupied by properly designed inhibitors. We have utilized molecular dynamics simulations to simulate binding of the newly designed inhibitors at the protein and to test their capacity to force the 216-loop open and occupy the created 216-cavity. The designed dual acting designer inhibitors represent the most potent designer compounds and efficiently block both human parainfluenza virus cell entry and virion progeny release. We have also defined the binding mode of these inhibitors in the presence of whole inactivated parainfluenza virus type 3 and recombinantly-expressed haemagglutinin-neuraminidase by Saturation Transfer Difference NMR spectroscopy. Collectively, our study provides a novel anti-parainfluenza virus pre-clinical candidate and new direction towards the discovery of potential anti-parainfluenza drugs.

University College of Pharmacy, India 2KLE University, India 3College of Health Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa In this research work, a series of eighteen novel coumarinyl substituted thiazolidin-2,4-dione analogs (4a-4r) have been designed by molecular hybridization approach, synthesized and their structures were established on the basis of FTIR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and elemental (CHN) analysis. These compounds were screened for their cytotoxicity using MTT assay methodology against five different mammalian cancer cell lines viz. hormone dependant breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7), cervical carcinoma (HeLa), prostate adeno cytotoxicity screening studies revealed that MCF-7, HeLa and A549 cancer cell lines were sensitive to all the tested compounds. Though the compounds showed varying degrees of cytotoxicity in the tested cell lines, most significant effect was observed for compounds 4i (1.06, 2.4 and 3.06 \u00b5M) and 4o 2.38 \u00b5M) against MCF7, HeLa and A549 cell lines respectively. In conclusion, the anticancer results of these promising leads strongly encouraged us for additional lead optimization with the aim of developing more potential anticancer agents. Sheikh-Ul Alam Memorial Degree College Budgam, India Natural products continue to impress drug discovery scientists by their amazing bioactivity profiles coupled with their highly complex molecular architecture. These compounds have been the principal source of anticancer chemotherapeutic agents over the last few decades. About 60-70% of the anticancer drugs which are clinically used have been either pure natural products, their synthetic or semi-synthetic derivatives. Among natural products, plant-derived compounds play a pivotal role in anticancer drug discovery programme. These plant-derived compounds include and its derivatives, irinotecan, paclitaxel etc. Various novel and promising anticancer drugs are currently under various phases of clinical trials. Natural products have seen many ups and downs viz-a-viz their role in cancer chemotherapy. During 90s these compounds saw a dip in the top-notch pharmaceutical companies mainly because of the high throughput screening programmes which involve targeted therapies using small molecules. However, barring few cancers, these therapies were confronted with the ineffectiveness with respect to several solid tumors. This has hugely revitalized their importance in anticancer drug discovery. The current review focuses on the plant-based natural compounds and herbal extracts which specifically induce anticancer effects via the induction of apoptosis. This review also discusses their mode of action along with their botanical origin. Gosling Research Institute for Plant Preservation, University of Guelph, Canada Plant based medicine offers an exceptionally broad range of preventative and curative health-promoting benefits for many serious health conditions such as dementia, arthritis, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. The synthesis and accumulation of medicinal metabolites is affected by plant genetics and environmental conditions of growth, processing and distribution, leading to enormous variability of active ingredients and poor quality of the products. Recent introduction of natural health product legislation is changing the ways in which natural health products (NHPs) are developed, manufactured, and marketed in worldwide. A range of evidences of safety, chemical consistency, and efficacy are now required for approval of all NHPs for release in the Canadian as well as US and European markets. This presentation will provide an overview of the challenges and the importance of controlled environment production to ensure product safety and efficacy of plant medicines. Integrated Plant Protection System (IPPS) is a cluster of technologies incorporating novel 3-D printed in vitro culture devices, smart bioreactors, growth chambers and greenhouses with efficient monitoring of environmental parameters and plant health for large-scale plant production. Melatonin rich plants with multiple therapeutic functions including the prevention of age-related neurological disorders will be used as a model to demonstrate the potential of IPPS to produce high quality plant based medicines. Melatonin is a mammalian neurohormone with multiple metabolic functions including neurotransmission and detoxification of reactive oxygen species. Also found in plants, melatonin and its precursor serotonin are believed to play a therapeutic role in sleep disorders, depression, Alzheimers, Parkinsons, and Huntingtons diseases in addition to aging and cancer. The IPPS has facilitated our research on rapid detection and optimization of melatonin in a range of neurologically active medicinal plants such as Hypericum, Echinacea, Scutellaria, Datura, and Salvia, as well as the discovery of novel medicinal compounds. The IPPS integrated approaches may redefine the ways in which the future plant medicines will be developed, manufactured, and marketed.

Spectrum Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research, India In the present scenario there is a need to evolve an eco-friendly processes for the synthesis of nanoparticles. The researchers are changing their focus from physical and chemical processes towards 'green' chemistry and bioprocesses. These processes not only help in health benefits in various ways such as :- 1) Clean water with less release of hazardous chemical wastes to water posing many diseases. 2) Safe environment for workers of chemical industry ie less fire and explosion damages 3) Less impure air:- Release of hazardous chemicals in air. 4) Safe consumer products will be synthesised. 5) Safe food as the hazardous chemicals which enter food chain will be less. In nano particle synthesis the increase in the surface area helps to increase surface energy and catalytic reactivity further increases which improves the effectiveness of nanoparticles. The synthesis of nanoparticle can be done by various techniques but the biological approach for the synthesis of nanoparticles become imperative. The advantage over the other biological processes are less elaborate process of maintaining cell culture with so many precautions and handling care. In the present research the various plant species are taken into consideration using this beneficial technique. The process of synthesis of silver nanoparticles will be by the reduction of aqueous Au3+ ions with the aqueous extract of various plant species. University of St Andrews, Biomedical Sciences Research Complex, United Kingdom Neurodegenerative diseases have multiple and often common mechanisms in their aetiologies. These multifactorial aspects have driven the search for multi-target drugs for use in therapy. Inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the brain is a well-established way to increase neurotransmitter levels, so is a commonly desired target for multi-target designed ligands (MTDL). Screening for MAO inhibition is not straightforward, so some of the interesting physiological and chemical features of these enzymes will be discussed, along with the different roles, locations, and kinetic properties of MAO A and MAO B. Examples of recent multitarget compounds designed to combat Alzheimers Disease will be given. In addition to slowing the breakdown of the neurotransmitters, MAO inhibitors (MAOI) and decrease oxidative stress by stopping the production of its second product, H2O2, that causes oxidative damage to mitochondria. Mitochondria are vital to healthy neurons to produce sufficient ATP to support the cycles of neurotransmitter release and reuptake, as well as to maintain a healthy cell. Multitarget compounds for Alzheimers disease treatment that inhibit both cholinesterases (for cognitive function) and monoamine oxidases (a proven anti-depressant strategy), can also act as antioxidants to protect mitochondrial function. New compounds were assessed against the individual targets and on cell survival and mitochondrial function in the cell. Some MAOI were assessed in a cellular model of neurodegeneration, namely in fully differentiated SH-SY5Y neurons were treated with homocysteic acid (HCA), an analogue of the neurotransmitter glutamate shown to induce neurodegenerative pathology. Cell viability was decreased by HCA but rescued by the MAOI. HCA treatment significantly decreased the proportion of normal mitochondria and increased the proportion of rounded and interconnected mitochondria, but MAOI gave some protection, decreasing the proportion of rounded mitochondria. These effects indicate that the mechanism of MAOI in the treatment of neurodegeneration is not just to spare the neurotransmitters. Biography: Rona R.

Diarrhea is one of the commonest diseases in the state. In remote villages, medicinal plants are an integral source of therapeutic drugs and play a significant role as easily available remedy among the rural folk. A good number of anti-diarrheal plants mullesua) were reported where leaf was the most preferred plant part. Of late, however, folk medicine is no more an attraction to the younger generations and is seriously threatened due to deforestation, environmental degradation and acculturation, currently taking place in the state. Documentation through ethnobotanical studies, nevertheless, is critical for conservation and utilization of this indigenous knowledge. It is worth mentioning that men, elder people and illiterate ones had better knowledge on medicinal plants use as compared to women, younger and literate people. Findings of this documentation study can be used as an ethnopharmacological basis for selecting plants for future phytochemical and pharmaceutical studies. Federal Ministry of Science and Technology, Abuja, Nigeria Tuberculosis (TB) is a dangerous disease that has killed several millions of people globally in recent times. The available drugs for the treatment of the disease are not effective for complete cure and in most cases, usually come with side effects, as a result of which new set of potent drugs are needed. In a quest to develop potent hit/drug leads for TB, betulinic acid (BA) and oleanolic acid (OA) were isolated respectively from Curtisiadentata and Syzigumaromaticum. The 3-O- Acetyl analogue of BA and OA were synthesized. The cinnamic acid conjugates at C-28 position of the four (4) synthesized compounds were all characterized using IR, MS and 1H and 13C NMR. All the test compounds exhibited anti-TB activity, albeit to different levels of efficacy. The MIC values of the two pentacyclictriterpenes (BA and OA) against the mycobacterium ranged from >109.48uM and 42.04uM respectively. The acetylation of BA and OA at C-3 position did not observably improve their activity (MIC value of 39.70uM and 100.26uM) andneither did the cinnamic acid ester of BA and OA at C-28 position enhance the anti-TB activity (MIC value of >85.20uM and 48.05uM respectively). The di-substituted, 3-O-Acetyl and 28- cinnamic acid ester of BA and OA however exhibited some enhanced anti-TB activity with MIC value of 17.88uM.

Department of Pharmacy, Birla Institute of Technology and Science-Pilani, India Purpose: Adenosine receptors (AR) play an important role in chemical signaling in both, peripheral and central nervous systems. Four subtypes of Adenosine Receptors have been identified: designated A1, A2A, A2B, and A3. A2A ARs are found in high density in certain brain regions, such as Striatum, Nucleus accumbens, and Olfactory tubercle. Adenosine exhibits high affinity to A2A ARs, which appear to be tonically activated under physiological conditions. A2A AR antagonists have been proposed as novel therapeutics for Epilepsy and Parkinsons disease. Methods: Human 0.22nM (PDB ID: 3EML) crystal coordinates were downloaded from protein data bank. Energy-optimized pharmacophore was prepared using Schrodinger software. The resulting pharmacophore model contains one hydrogen bond Acceptor (A), one hydrogen bond Donor (D) and three Ring systems (R). Using these features, screened against the public library of compounds (Asinex) to find potential lead compounds. Results: The compounds which yielded fitness score of more than 1.0 the pharmacophore model were further subjected to Glide HTVS, SP and XP. Glide docking results revealed 33 hits were identified as potential lead molecules. Among them 9 Asinex molecules were selected based on the highest docking score and more number of hydrogen bonds with Glu169, Asn253 amino acids and Compounds were evaluated in the PTZ induced seizure model in adult zebrafish (standard 8 min. protocol). Furthermore most potent compounds were evaluated for Dose response analysis and major toxicities in Zebrafish model. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a pharmacophore search using a model based on A2A AR inhibition, and the enzymes structural features can be used to screen for new candidates for antiepileptic therapy. Most potent compound to show Anti-epileptic activity was selected and derivatives are synthesized to develop SAR. These have to be validated by using In vitro inhibitory activity. Department of Biological Sciences, Ahmadu Bello University, Nigeria The in vitro antimalarial activity of the crude methanol extract of Urelytrum giganteum used by traditional healers in Zaria, Nigeria for malaria treatment was screened against the erythrocyte stages of Plasmodium falciparum (strains 3D7 and FCR3). The screening methodology involved using the Malaria SYBR Green I- based fluorescence used as a cytotoxicity test for the crude extract. The crude extract and fractions obtained from non-polar and polar column elutions were dissolved in a non- lethal DMSO concentration (0.013%), serially diluted and added to ring stage of P. falciparum (200\u00b5l at 1 % parasitemia, 2 % hematocrit) with chloroquine (0.5\u00b5M, as control) and incubated at 37\u00b0C static for 96 hrs. This crude extract showed an IC50 of 6.78\u00b1 0.78\u00b5g/ml against 3D7 strain, IC50 of 6.70\u00b1 0.82\u00b5g/ml against FCR3 strain and only five column fractions from the fractions tested showed the highest activity against the parasite with notable IC50 values of 2.74, 2.05, 5.00, 1.46 and 3.96 \u00b5g/ml. The compounds phenyl propanoid and free fatty acids were identified from these fractions using GC-MS. Moreover, this crude extract exhibited no haemolytic activity at concentrations of 5 and 1 \u00b5g/ml against human erythrocytes. The outcome of these evaluations seems to support the basis for the traditional use of this plant in the management of malarial by ethno medicinal practitioners. However, further toxicity studies are encouraged to be carried out before this extract can find use in clinical management of malaria. Keywords: MSF, Nirma University, India Cancer is 2nd major and deadliest disease after metabolic disorder. There are approximately 1,665,540 new cases of all cancer sited in 2014 and an estimated of 585,720 people died. We carried out extensive literature search on Aurora Kinase, which is one of the vital target in the treatment of cancer. Hence, present research efforts were made todiscover potent molecules against Aurora kinase inhibition for cancer treatment. Based on preliminary computational study, structural importance of pteridine moiety in highest QFIT value molecule of virtual hit; it was selectedas a core moiety for further designing of molecules. 20 substituted pteridinederivatives were designed, synthesized and characterised by 1H and 13C NMR, mass andelemental analysis, while purity was checked by HPLC. All these compounds were evaluatedfor in vitro studies on five cancer lines; from which, compoundswere found potent, specifically on cancer cell line. Based upon results of in vitro studies, they wereselected further, along with 5-FU, for in vivo study by cancer model on mice. Compound showed favourable actions against cancer and treated tumoursdemonstrating micro molar potential of the series. This study could be explored in future to design lead molecule for the treatment of cancer. Biography: Ankit Borisa is a Ph.D Research Scholar of M.Pharma, Medical Chemistry in Department of pharmaceutical chemistry, Institute of pharmacy, Nirma University, Ahmedabad City, Gujrat state, India.-382481 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran Retinoblastoma(Rb) is known as a rare form of cancer that rapidly develops from the immature cells of a retina. This article focuses on a very important aspect of Rbbased on biomarker discovery covers the pros and cons of using miRNAs as important prognostics, diagnostics and therapeutics biomarkers for this deadly disease. Proper monitoring and treatment are the cornerstones for the improvement of Rb outcomes. Several lines of evidence have shown that miRNAs can affect various pathogic events involved in Rb. The miRNAs regulate more than one hundred gene targets, on the other hand, one gene can also be regulated by a number of miRNAs. These molecules can serve as diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers in various stage of Rb. Here, we highlighted the state of the art for both discovered miRNAs as biomarkers and also future need to ascertain if the use of miRNAs in combination with different systemic and conventional biomarkers and therapies would result in improved outcomes of Rb patients. BharatiVidyapeeths College of Pharmacy, India Thiazolidinediones (TZDs)viz., troglitazone, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, were explored for their antidiabetic activity are now being unearthed for their anticancer activity. This is evident by the recent reports suggesting that these agents help in eradicating leukemic stem cells in combination with imatinib. However, these known TZDs cause several side effects and these have been attributed to their ability to activate peroxisome proliferative activated receptor (PPAR) receptor. To evade the toxicity we rationally designed and synthesized TZD containing moieties (3a-3y) which would spare PPAR. Synthesized molecules were screened on various malignant cell lines using SRB assay. Almost all moieties exhibited GI50activity on breast (MCF-7), oral (GURAV) and leukemia (K-562) cell lines in the range of 0.5\u00b5M- 80\u00b5M. Imatinib, a gold standard for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)has started gaining resistance. Considering the recent reports on known TZDs in CMLpatients and resistance issue, we further continued our work with K562 cell line. Few molecules were found to arrest G0/G1 phase of cell cycle in dose(5 \u00b5M, 10 \u00b5M, 25 \u00b5M and 40 \u00b5M) and time dependent manner (at 10 \u00b5M and 20 \u00b5M). Two leads 3t and 3x were selected and further found to inhibit cyclin D1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) at 10 \u00b5M and 20 \u00b5M using immunoblotting assay. The pharmacokinetic studies of these two derivatives were studied and reported. Moieties were further evaluated for in-vivo tumor regression activity alone and in combination with imatinib in nude mice. Molecules substantially reduced the tumor size in combination with imatinib. Biography: Hardik Joshi is a Ph D senior research fellow worked on a project funded by Basic Research in Nuclear Sciences (BRNS), India in collaboration with Tata Memorias Advance Centre for Research and Education in Cancer (ACTREC). Mr. Joshi worked on design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel thiazolidinediones and its bioisosteres as anticancer agents. He has presented parts of his research work at various international platforms and has published review and research articles in esteemed journals. Faculty of Pharmacy, Yeditepe University, Turkey Cancer results from unregulated cell growth. Reactivating cell death in cancer cells, i.e. apoptosis, is a classical anticancer therapeutic strategy. Theapoptosis-inducerproperty of the acidethyl ester (ALC67) molecule has been discovered recently1,2. Toelucidate the mechanism of action of this molecule and to evaluate the impact of the phenyl group that the thiazolidine ring presents at its second position on thecytotoxicity, we developed derivatives ALC 67 analogues replacing the phenylmoiety with various aliphatic and aromatic groups. Thecyto toxic activity of thenovel (2RS,4R)-2-phenyl-3-propinoyl-thiazolidine-4-carboxylic ester derivatives were on humanliver HUH7 Mahlavuhepato cellular carcinoma cell (HCC) lines with the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. Results demonstrated that the antiproliferative property was conserved when the phenylmoiety was replaced. Since the mutagenic and genotoxic properties of marketed anticancer molecules constitute a main issue to be addressed, then we fosuced on the analysis of the mutagenecity, antimutagenecity and Themutagenicity and antimutagenicity of ALC67 were evaluated by Ames test performed on Salmonella TA98 and TA100 strains. Thegenotoxicity of this molecule was investigated in the chromosomalaberrationassay on humanlymphocytes. All results revealed that the analyzed structure is not mutagenic in two Salmonella strains tested and was not genotoxic in humanly mphocytes in vitro. All these results indicate that after performing some more mutagenicityassay using other recommended strains, this compound can be safely used for the development of new structures exhibiting anticancer activities. 1Department of Information Technology, Kumaun University, India 2Department of Statistics, Kumaun University, India 3Department of Botany, Kumaun India 4School of Computational and Integrative Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, India In present work, we used three machine learning classifiers: Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine to build three predictive models of an anti-mycobacterial dataset obtained from ChEMBL database and evaluated for their predictive capability. Based on the statistical evaluation, Random forest model showed the slightly higher area under the curve (AUC), better accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in the cross-validation tests as compared to Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine. The statistical results indicated that the Random Forest model was the best predictive model with 93.83% accuracy, 98.4% ROC, Decision tree model came out to be the second with 92.8% accuracy, 95.2% ROC and the SVM model was found to be last with 90.64% accuracy, 93.8% ROC. Additionally, we built toxicity prediction models on the Single Cell call DSSTox carcinogenicity database (AID1189) using machine learning classifiers. The result showed that the Random Forest model was the best predictive model based on zero toxicity tolerance. We deployed the anti-mycobacterial and toxicity prediction models were on ChEMBL anti-malarial dataset containing 1.5 lakh compounds and a dataset of 1554 approved drugs resulting 27705 and 1554 compounds respectively as nontoxic anti-mycobacterial compounds. Thus machine learning models present highly efficient methods to find out novel hit anti-mycobacterial compounds. We suggest that such machine learning techniques could be very useful to screen drug candidates not only for tuberculosis but also for other diseases. 1Department of Information Technology, Kumaun University, India 2Department of Statistics, Kumaun University, India 3Department of Botany, Kumaun India 4School of Computational and Integrative Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, India Machine learning techniques are advanced computational techniques which can be used to build a predictive model of compounds dataset to find out important features to predict a specific biologicalactivity from unknown compounds and design better drugs. In present study, several QSAR models were constructed by using machine learning approaches on three different datasets ChEMBL3132000, ChEMBL907779, and AID (ENR) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is one of the key enzymes involved in the mycobacterial fatty acid elongation cycle and has been validated as an effective antimicrobial target. The best QSAR models were built with excellent values of statistical matrices from each dataset and deployed on a data set of 1450 approved drug from drug bank. Amoxicillin found to be highest predicted activity 6.54 pIC50, and Itraconazole is second highest predicted activity 6.4 pIC50 calculated based on the RF model using CFS-GS-FW descriptor set in the dataset of ChEMBL997779 of InhAMtb. The RF QSAR model predicted several potential drugs which could be novel InhAMtb inhibitors. Additionally, Molecular docking identified top-ranked 10 approved drugs as antitubercular hits showing G-scores-8.23 to -6.95(in kcal/mol). Further, high throughput virtual screening identified top 10 compounds as antitubercular leads showing G-scores -9.26 to -8.24 (in control -6.68 (in kcal/mol) which are known antitubercularInhAMtb inhibitors (ChEMBL907779:DS2 dataset). This result indicates these novel compounds have the best binding affinity for InhAMtb. Among this studies, we conclude that machine learning based QSAR models can be useful for the development of novel target specific antitubercular compounds. Moulay Ismail University, Morocco The present wok aims to evaluate the cardiovascular effect of Nigella sativa L. aqueous extract (NSAE) in normal rats. The in vivo experiment showed that the intravenous injection of NSAE at the doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg of body weight produced a dose dependent reduction in the mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) (p<0.001) accompanied by a significant fall in heart rate (p<0.01). In the in vitro experiment, NSAE was tested at the doses of 10, 20 and 30 mg/ml. Addition of NSAE to the plateau contraction induced by Norepinephrine (NE) produced a dose dependent reduction in the arterial tone (p<0.01). Furthermore, incubation of NSAE during 30 min caused a right shift of the contraction response curve of aortic ring to NE with a reduction of the maximal contraction response (p<0.01). Endothelium destruction significantly reduced the vasorelaxant effect of NSAE at a dose of 30 Furthermore, Nitric oxide synthase inhibitor: Nw-Nitro-L-Argenine Methyl (L-NAME) a significant reduction (p<0.01) of the in vitro vasorelaxant effect of NSAE at a dose of 30 mg/ml. We conclude that NSAE possess a rapid and dose dependent in vivo hypotensive effect in normal rats which may be probably due to the inhibition of parasympathetic tone. In isolated aortic ring, NSAE possess a potent inhibitor of contractile response to NE which may be probably due to an increase in the endothelial nitric oxide synthesis.

Moulay Ismail University, Morocco The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose and daily oral administration for seven days of the aerial part aqueous extract (A.P.A.E) of Tamarix articulata Vahl. (T. articulata) at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight on blood glucose levels in both normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (STZ). Single oral administration of T. articulata A.P.A.E reduced blood glucose levels 6 h after administration in normal rats and STZ diabetic rats (p<0.0001). Furthermore, blood glucose levels were decreased in both normal and STZ diabetic rats after seven days of treatment (p<0.0001). Moreover, no significant changes in body weight in normal and STZ rats were shown. According to the oral glucose tolerance test, the aqueous extract of T. articulata (20 mg/kg) was shown to improve significantly the increase on blood glucose levels in normal treated rats (p<0.001) 90 min after glucose administration as compared to the control groups. Finally, histopathological analysis revealed the beneficial effect of T. articulata on pancreas and liver. In conclusion, this study demonstrates antihyperglycemic and hypoglycemic affects of T. articulata in severe diabetic state thus warrants further investigation on its major compounds with in depth mechanistic supported by the CNRST under grant n\u00b0 PPR/2015/35.

Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Strathclyde, UK Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a worldwide chronic disorder which is characterised by insulin resistance and high blood glucose levels (1). The treatment of type 2 diabetes involves the use of traditional oral antidiabetic agents, such as sulphonylurea or glibenclamide, metformin, and/or insulin (2). However, incidence of the disease is increasing in many parts of the world which means novel antidiabetic agents are needed. Recently, new types of oral antidiabetic agents that inhibit DPP-IV have been developed and one has been approved for medical use. Collaboration between Strathclyde Innovations in Drug Research (SIDR) and the Drug Discovery Portal (DDP) using a combination of virtual and high throughput screening identified a novel hit (AM11) against DPP-IV. The aim of this project was to modify AM11 to see if inhibition against DPP-IV could be improved. Compounds with a range of activities against DPP-IV were prepared, but all had comparable or lower activity than AM11. Docking studies were performed to explain the structure-activity relationship profiles of the different libraries prepared. Department of Chemistry, Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India Cancer is a class of genetic disease caused by disregulation of various cellular pathways that orchestrate cell growth and death. Chemotherapy is the major technique to treat various types of cancers. Unfortunately it is associated with severe side effects. To improve the drug selectivity, researchers started exploring several new avenues and combination oftwo or more pharmacophores is one such approach. Azaindoles and 1,2,3-triazoles are imperative class of heterocyclics and play a major role in medicinal chemistry. Several of these were found to have anti-cancer and anti-angiogenic properties. Several pharmacophores like naphthofuranones, methoxyphenyl oximes, and piperazinylindenoquinolinone having oxime (hydroxylamino) as a functional group display very good anticancer activity (Fig 1). A series of novel 1, 2, 3-triazole derivatives of 7-azaindole (5A-O) were synthesized (Scheme 1) and screened for their in vitro cytotoxicityagainst MDA MB-231(breast), A549(Lung) and HeLa(cervical) cancer cell lines, by sulforhodamine B assay method. All the synthesized compounds exhibited antiproliferative activity with GI50 values ranging from 0.12 to 9.84 \u00b5M. It is observed that, majority of the compounds displayed significant growth inhibition on A549 and MDA MB 231 cancer cell lines as compared to HeLa cancer cell line. Compounds 5d and 5k showed potent activity against A549 with GI50 values 0.12 \u00b5Mand 0.16 \u00b5M while the positive controls, doxorubicin and paclitaxel demonstrated the GI50 in the range of 0.01-0.09 \u00b5M and < 0.01-0.023 \u00b5M respectively. These derivatives were also subjected to molecular docking study to investigate the mode of binding by using ALK (Human anaplastic lymphoma kinase) enzyme using Schrodinger suite 2013.

Division of Human Genetics, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town Background: Warfarin is the most commonly used drug in the management of thromboembolic disease. However, there is a huge variability in the time, number of doses or starting doses for patients to achieve the required international normalised ratio (INR) which is compounded by a narrow therapeutic index. Many genetic-association studies have reported on European and Asian populations which have led to the designing of specific algorithms that are now being used to assist in warfarin dosing. However, very few or no studies have looked at the pharmacogenetics of warfarin in African populations, yet, huge differences in dosage requirements to reach the same INR have been observed. Objective: We set out to investigate the distribution of 3 SNPs CYP4F2 c.1347C>T, VKORC1 g.-1639G>A and VKORC1 c.1173C>T among South African Mixed Ancestry (MA) and Black African patients. Methods: DNA was extracted from 383 participants and subsequently genotyped the Black and MA groups, significant differences were observed in the distribution of the following genotypes; and therefore expected to affect the amount of warfarin needed to block vitamin k recycling. The VKORC1 g-1639A variant alters transcriptional regulation therefore affecting the function of vitamin k epoxide reductase in vitamin k production. The VKORC1 c.1173T variant reduces the enzyme activity of VKORC1 consequently enhancing the effectiveness of warfarin. These are preliminary results; more genetic characterization is required to understand all the genetic determinants affecting how patients "}
