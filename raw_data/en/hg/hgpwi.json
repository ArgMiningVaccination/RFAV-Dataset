Especially now it might be helpful for those who value Anthroposophy to re-familiarize (or familiarize) ourselves with some insights given by Rudolf Steiner regarding viruses, lung illnesses, etc. Since his days many remedies ( based on his indications), that might be helpful now, have been introduced. We will explain some of them and hopefully this will answer some of the many questions that have come to the True Botanica Company and the Kolisko Institute. Importantly we will present a sequence of eurythmy therapy exercises that Rudolf Steiner gave specifically to improve the immune system in connection with viral illnesses. For the Team at both True Botanica and the Kolisko Institute, In Health, Ross Rentea MD, Mark Kamsler MD and Andrea Rentea MD *The live webinar is free but there may be a purchase charge once we post it on the web.
