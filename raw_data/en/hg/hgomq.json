The Reddemanns for many years graced us with their presence at the Equinoxes and Winter Solstice. During their ceremonies, ancestors and spirit allies are invoked to assist healing of body, mind and heart and lend light on the spiritual path. NOTE: Out of respect for indigenous wisdom regarding the configuration of the etheric body and aura and how these are affected during sacred ceremony, we ask all participants to observe this protocol: \u2014Please do not consume any alcohol on the day of the ceremony \u2014Women, please wear an ankle length skirt or dress, with arms covered. \u2014Women who are on the bleeding phase of the menstrual cycle should abstain from attending in person, and instead are encouraged to connect through meditation and prayer.
