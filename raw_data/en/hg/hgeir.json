[While USADA has a long history of working to improve dietary supplement safety](/spirit-of-sport/science/protecting-athletes-consumers-fight-against-supplement-risks/), the reality is that the use of dietary supplements can be risky, and that awareness and caution must be exercised when considering their use. If you're looking for a quick answer, then USADA recommends you use only supplements certified by NSF Certified for Sport\u00ae as the way to best reduce your risk. While no resource can protect you completely, Supplement Connect will help you gain a better understanding of the dietary supplement issue by covering the topics below: Dietary supplements are regulated in a post-market fashion, which means that no regulatory body approves the accuracy of the label or safety of the contents before they are sold to consumers.

USADA currently recognizes NSF Certified for Sport\u00ae as the program best suited for athletes to reduce the risk from supplements.
