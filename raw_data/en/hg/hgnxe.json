Modern surgery for hip replacement is conventional medicine at its BEST! As a person who got a new (right) hip in February, 2022, I speak from experience, and at the same time, I have personally known several dozen friends who have had similarly excellent experiences getting a new hip. That said, there ARE homeopathic medicines that you can consider to help in the healing process. The protocol that I recommend include the following medicines (Please note that we provide a SPECIFIC PROTOCOL for using these medicines when you purchase this protocol from us!) (ointment) Homeopathic medicine was developed into a specialized system of medicine in the 19th century, initially in Germany and then rapidly spread across the world. It became particularly popular in the USA in the late 1800s and early 1900s. There were 22 homeopathic medical schools in the USA in the early 20th century, including such esteemed schools as Boston University, University of Michigan, Ohio State University, University of Minnesota, New York Medical College, Hahnemann Medical College, amongst others. In 1938, the famous Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act was signed into law, empowering the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate drugs. The author of this law, Royal Copeland, was a three-term U.S. Senator from New York who also happened to be a medical doctor as well as a homeopathic physician. This Act gave formal recognition to homeopathic medicines which these natural medicines have enjoyed until today. In the past century, homeopathic medicine was primarily practiced by medical doctors, but for many decades now it is used by a wide variety of health and medical professionals, and these medicines can also be used by consumer to self-treat non-life-threatened conditions. Homeopathic medicines are primarily regulated like over-the-counter drugs, where they are dispensed in the extremely small and safe doses. The doses used in homeopathy are exceedingly small and have a two-century history of high levels of safety. The \"Number/Letter\" after the name of the medicine is in reference to its potency. \"12C\" means that this medicine was diluted 1:100 twelve times. \"200C\" means that this medicine was diluted 1:100 two-hundred times. \"1M\" means that this medicine was diluted 1:100 one-thousand times (\"M\" is the Roman numeral for 1,000). Specific instruction for the usage of each medicine will be provided when they are sent to patients. The reason to use this protocol is to try to augment the recovery of people undergoing hip replacement, and when possible, to reduce the need for as frequent usage of painkilling medication. Arnica 1M (moutain daisy): Arnica is a leading homeopathic medicine to help reduce the shock and trauma of injury (or from surgery), and it also has been shown to reduce bruising and swelling from this trauma as well as reduce the need for conventional pain medications. Arnica 12C: homeopathic medicine that is known to help heal bone fracture and bone bruises. Nux Vomica 12C (Quaker buttons, a seed from a tree): Nux vomica is a homeopathic medicine that has many usages. First, it is a medicine used to reduce side effects from painkilling drugs, and it is helpful in the restoration of bowel function, reducing constipation. Traumeel Tablets: Traumeel is a homeopathic formula made in Germany by a pharmaceutical company that is owned by the same family that makes that famous German car, the BMW. This homeopathic formula is the leading sports medicine in the world, and it is used by many professional athletes, Olympic athletes, and weekend warriors. It is an important natural medicine for healing strains and strains of connective tissue. Because the injury to connective tissue occurs from surgical procedures, this medicine can also be used to augment the natural healing processes after surgery. Traumeel (external application): This is a topical application of the same medicine as above.
