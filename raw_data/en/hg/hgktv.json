Warren, MD According to both the fifth-century BC poet Pindar and the first-century BCRoman poet Ovid, Asklepios, the godof healing, was born as a result of aunion between the god Apollo and thebeautiful mortal Coronis. Pregnantand ashamed, Coronis was slain byApol lo, who then removed the unbornbaby from her lifeless womb andnamed him Asklepios, which meansgentle dryness and gave the child to Chiron, the centaur, to raise. The cen-taur taught him the secrets of herbalmedicine and Asklepios became a wisephysician. Later the goddess Athena taught Asklepios to raise the dead to life, in -curring the rage of Zeus, who slewAsklepios with a thunderbolt. Apollogrieved and interceded with Zeus,who then granted Asklepios life as ahero god. Unlike the Olympian gods,hero gods were mortal and lived onEarth but had special powers and su -pernatural longevity. There is some epigraphic reference to the myth of Asklepios as a healinggod in the works of both Ho mer in theeighth century BC, and dedication tohim continued to flourish from thefifth century BC through to the fourthcentury AD. An Asklepian cult devel-oped and large temples dedicated to himflourished throughout the Greek andlater the Roman world. After the Hippocratic school de - veloped in the fifth century BC, therewas some combining of the scientific-observational techniques of this heal-ing tradition with the mystical cura-tive methods practised by Asklepianpriests. The healing temples of Asklepios attracted a higher class of patients thandid the early itinerant Hi ppocratic phy sicians. No midwifery or dyingpatients were allowed within the tem-ple precincts. Pausanias says, \"Nei-ther do people die in the enclosure nordo they give birth.\" Only patients whocould achieve a degree of purity wereadmitted. A healing temple of Asklepios in - cluded an area called the abaton where patients ( incubi) would sleep and, it was believed, be cured by a nighttimevisit from the god, who would removetheir diseased parts. This process wascalled incubation. Asklepian priests were usually accompanied by serpentsand dogs. The serpents, which wereoften wound around a staff, were anintegral part of the healing process.premise Classical pathways to western medicine Modern medicine bears traces of the early influences of the healingtraditions of classical Greece andRome as found in the mysticaltraditions of the ancient cult ofAsklepios and the scientific,observational practices of theHippocratic school.

When patients were cured of ill- nesses, they often provided thank-offerings of clay models of the ana -tomical parts that were cured. Maleflesh was always in red clay and fe malein white. There were a number of man-ufacturing stalls around the As kle piantemples that sold \"off the rack\" organs,but the more expensive custom-made. V otive offerings were oftenaccompanied by testimonials, andboth provide a profile of the diseasessuffered by Greeks seeking treatmentat these temples. For example, thepresence of 35 clay models of malegenitalia found at an Askle pian tem-ple in Corinth\u2014a port city known for licentiousness in the Greekworld\u2014adjacent to a temple ofAphro dite, goddess of erotic love andbeauty (hence aphrodisiac ) likely sug- gests a cure of impotence rather thanvenereal disease since syphilis wasunknown in antiquity. Asklepios shared his healing facil- ity with members of his \"divine fam-ily,\" which consisted of Epione, hiswife, who relieved pain; Panacea, hisdaughter, who gave treatment; other daughter, who wasthe patroness of health (hygiene).Teles phorus, a son, was a patron ofrehabilitation, and two other sons,Machaon and Podaleirios, were pa - trons of surgery and med icine. All ofthe di vine family acted in concert inthe temples of Asklepios as multi -specialty healers. Clean water, clean air, and salubri- ous ambience were all present in theAsklepian healing temples. Mental re -laxation was provided through activi-ties in the gymnasium, theatre, andvarious purification rites in cold andhot springs and the ocean. The healingtemples were always on a hilltop, in aglade, or near a spring in areas wheregods would likely dwell. Hippocrates and theHippocratic school Known as the father of medicine, Hip-pocrates is believed to have been bornin 460 BC on the Greek island of Kos.Though references to him by his con-temporaries are few, Plato does refer tohim twice: once in the Republic as \"one who taught for fees\" andagain as \"the Asklepian Kos\" and\"the famous Asklepian.\" thrust of the Hippocratic method was scientific observation ofpatients that included an examination,taking a history, and then arriving at aprognosis. He developed some knowl-edge of anatomy, disease, and pathogen-esis. Hippocrates defined the role of thephysician as \"deliverance of the sickfrom pain, the reduction of diseases,violence, and the refusal to treat thoseoverpowered by these diseases with theknowledge that medical art is unavail-ing in these cases.\" At its heart was theconcept that disease had a physical causerather than arising as a result of the dis-pleasure of a capricious god. The Hippocratic Corpus is a body of about 60 treatises on anatomy, phy -siology, timing of treatment, diagno-sis, prognosis, surgery, instrumentmaking, and aphorisms. Though itbears his name, this body of knowl-edge was not all written by Hip-pocrates as the material has been datedas originating over a period of at leasta century. However, it is clear that Hip-pocrates either began or was deeplyinvolved in a medical school on theisland of Kos, and these books likelyrepresent the school's entire syllabus.The books were later moved to Alexan-dria, where they were used in the med-ical school located there and the Hip- pocratic Corpus was finally as sembled in its known entirety around the 10thcentury AD. The Hippocratic school embr aced the teaching of the fifth-century BCphilosopher, Empedocles, and built onthe existing theory that all matter con-sisted of the four elements: water,earth, air, and fire. The Hippocraticschool expanded this concept to ex -plain the cause of disease in patients asresulting from a disharmony be tweenthe four humors in the body: blood,bile, yellow bile, and phlegm. Humandisease was a result of either an excessor shortage of these and treatment con-sisted of trying to harmonize these fouressential ingredients of the humanbody. It is unclear who wrote the Hippo- cratic oath or exactly who took theoath. It is attributed to Hippocratesbut references in it to abortion and sui-cide, among other things, contradictHippocrates' own principles and prac-tices as revealed in the Hippocratic Corpus; rather they reflect the Pytha - gorean school of thought that regardedall life as sacred. It is likely that theoath itself has a number of authors. The earliest known use of the Hip- pocratic oath was in Witte nburg in 1508 and then in Montpe llier in 1804. From time to time in medical schools,the oath has had a renaissance, includ-ing an unsuccessful attempt by theBritish Medical Association to updateit. This attempt was generally rejectedand no further efforts were made, but medical societies throughout theworld have continued to concentrateon the oath's codes of ethics. A 1992 study by Peterson and col- leagues found that the Hippocraticmethod of taking a thorough historyand doing a physical examination pro-vided a diagnosis 88% of the time.Seventy-six percent of cases in theirretrospective analysis were diagnosedby history only, a further 12% byphysical examination, and only 12%by all other laboratory tests. Theresults suggest that in the hands of anexperienced physician, the Hippocraticmethod of history-taking and physicalexamination is effective. Building on earlier traditions Aristotle was born in 384 BC. He was the son of a court physician to Mace-donia who studied medicine and laterphilosophy with Plato. However,premise Continued on page 384BC MEDICAL JOURNAL VOL. 48 NO. 8, OCTOBER 2006 384since he came from nobility, it is unlikely that he practised medicine.His social position would have madeit appropriate only to learn the theoryof medicine, including the fundamen-tals of diet, drugs, exercise, ban-daging, splints for fractures and dis-locations, and poultices of flour, wine,and oil. However, along with Hip-pocrates, Aristotle did establish thescience of observation of facts ratherthan theory. He says, \"The facts havenot been sufficiently established. Ifever they are, then credit must be givento observation and to theories onlyinsofar as they have been confirmed byobserved fact.\" This statement is self-evident to you and me, but it was arevolutionary idea in Aristotle's time.His teacher, Plato, had promoted theapplication reason and logic\u2014a top-down pro cess\u2014to determine the solu-tion to problems rather than the Aris-totlian view that experimentation andobservation were necessary to developviable theories. Galen was a second-century philo - sopher and physician raised in Perga-mum and was initially associated withthis kingdom's great temple of Askle-pios. He later studied both philosophyand medicine and promoted the four-humors theory of Hippocrates. He was the chief physician to the high priests' gladiators in Pergamumand had ample opportunity to lookafter wounds and observe human ana -tomy. This experience, combined withhis extensive dissections of lower pri-mates, allowed him to formulate manyfacts and theories of anatomy whichbuilt on the philos ophy of Aristotle that in terms of human anatomy,\"nature does nothing in vain.\" Galen's work gained recognition when he moved to Rome to further hiscareer as an investigator, scientist, andphysician. Eventually, he became thechief physician to the emperor Com-modus and by the end of his life, Galenhad written 129 treaties on philosophy and medicine. These writings served asa model for physicians throughout theDark Ages. Paganism ended in the Roman Em - pire shortly after 312 AD in the reignof Constantine the Great. Constantinebecame a Christian and eventually allof the pagan temples of As klepios werereduced to rubble and Christian church-es were built on the same sites.Though some of the Christian church-es appear to have had healing tradi-tions, salvation was their primaryinterest and rather than being some-thing from which to flee, death was tobe embraced. Traces of the past Modern medicine may have advancedwell beyond what was even imagin-able in the days of the Asklepian priestphysicians, students of the Hippocrat-ic School, and the ancient physicianphilosophers who followed in theirfootsteps, but the influence of theseancient healing systems is still visibletoday. Today we acknowledge the As -klepian trust in the healing benefits ofclean air, water, and salubrious cir-cumstances; spiritual renewal, beliefas a healing force; and the value of thehealth care team. And from the tradi-tions of the Hippocratic School, wedraw our use of ethical guidelines, clin-ical methods, sceptical approaches,and philosophical and intuitiveappraisals as well as the practices ofsourcing of medicines from nature andsurgical instrument making. These early pathways to the art and science of healing still serve to guideus today. Further reading Asklepios, the God of Medicine, Gerald D. Hart, Royal Society of Medicine Press.
