Community Benefit FY 2021 Report and FY 2022 Plan Chandler Regional Medical Center 7 Description of the Community Served Dignity Health defines the community served by a hospital as those individuals residing within its primary and secondary service areas. The primary service area includes all residents in a defined geographic area surrounding the hospital and does not exclude low-income or underserved populations. The primary service area for Chandler Regional Medical Center ( CRMC) includes the zip codes making up the top 75% of the total patient cases. The City of Chandler is primarily served by CRMC for acute care and trauma services. A summary description of the community is below in Table 1.1 . Additional details can be found in the CHNA report online. Chandler is becoming a hub for manufactur ing of semiconductors , chips and other computer -related technology which include , Intel, Microchip, and Northrop Grumman Corporation. In 2020, Intel had approximately 12,000 employees across two campuses and ope ned its Fab 42 facility which is a $7 billion investment planned to create 3,000 jobs in Chandler. The city is home to nationally recognized employers Arizona State University Chandler Innovation Center, PayPal, Garmin, Pearson Education and Chandler Municipal Airport. However, despite strong economic growth, there continues to be many factors and social determinants of health in the suburban Chandler communities that need to be addressed in order to improve the health and wellbeing for the broader commun ity and the underserved. Challenges for this community include high rates of poverty, violence - associated injuries, a large non -English speaking population, and low education attainment, all of which create barriers to access. Downtown Chandler has a sign ificant population of uninsured and underinsured non-English speaking persons of all age groups. A large majority of this population is also indigent with their primary source of income through day labor and seasonal work. As with other communities across the nation, the City of Chandler has been significantly impacted and challenged by COVID -19. The town's governance, businesses, nonprofits and faith communities collectively responded to the needs of community exacerbated by the COVID 19 pandemic. Communi ty demographics, according to 2020 Census -Maricopa Association of Governments White: 58.4%, Hispanic or Latino: 22.6%, Asian: 12.0%, Black or African American 6.0%. Household median income in 2018 was $99,000. Within a one -mile radius of Downtown Chandler, between 25% 40% of families live in poverty, which is an alarmingly high poverty rate.

Zip code areas with the highest risks are 85210, 85122 and 8520 2. Table 1.2 Community Benefit FY 2021 Report and FY 2022 Plan Chandler Regional Medical Center 10 Community Assessment and Significant Needs The hospital engages in multiple activities to conduct its community he alth improvement planning process. These include, but are not limited, to conducting a Community Health Needs Assessment with community input at least every three years, identifying collaborating community stakeholder organizations, describing anticipated impacts of program activities and measuring program indicators. Community Health Needs Assessment T he health issues that form the basis of the hospital's communit y benefit plan and programs were identified in the most recent CHNA report, which was adopted in January 2019. T he CHNA contains several key elements, including: Description of the assessed community served by the hospital; Description of assessment processes and methods; Presentation of data, information and findings, including significant community health needs; Community resources potentially available to hel p address identified needs; and Discussion of impacts of actions taken by the hospital since the preceding CHNA. A dditional detail about the needs assessment process and findings can be found in the CHNA report, which is publicly available at https://www.dignityhealth.org/about-us/community- health /community- health -programs-and-reports/community- health -needs- assessments or upon request at the hospital's Community Health office.

Community Benefit FY 2021 Report and FY 2022 Plan Chandler Regional Medical Center 11 This report specifies planned activities consistent with the hospital's mission and capabilities. The hospital may amend the plan as circumstances warrant. For instance, changes in significant community health needs or in community assets and resources directed to those needs may merit refocusing the hospital's limited resources to best serve the community. The a nticipated impacts of the hospital's activities on significant health needs are summarized below, and for select program initiatives are stated in Program Digests. Overall, the hospital anticipates that actions taken to address significant health needs wi ll: improve health knowledge, behaviors, and status, increase acces s to needed and beneficial care, and help create conditions that support good health. The hospital works to evaluate impact and sets priorities for its community health programs in triennia l Community Health Needs Assessments. Creating the Community Benefit Plan Rooted in Dignity Health's mission, vision and values, Chandler Regional Medical Center is dedicated to improving community health and delivering community benefit with the enga gement of its management team, h ospital board, clinicians & staff, C ommunity Health Committee (CHC) and in collaboration with community partners . The board and committee are composed of community members who provide stewardship and direction for the hospital as a community resource. These parties review community benefit plans and program updates prepared by the hospital's community health director and other staff. As a matter of Dignity Health policy, the hospital's community health and community benefit pr ograms are guided by five core principles. All of our initiatives relate to one or more of these principles: Focus on disproportionate unmet health- related needs Emphasize prevention Contribute to a seamless continuum of care Build community capaci ty Demonstrate collaboration Additionally, CRMC abides by the Dignity Health Mission Standards that include Organizational Identity, Spirituality and Culture, Ethical Principles, and Community Health and the Common Good. The Mission standards serve as a foundation and guide as we further our mission of compassion, advocac y and partnership. Standards 7 - 9 under Community Health and Common Good align with the scope of work recommended in the Implementation Strategy. Community Benefit FY 2021 Report and FY 2022 Plan Chandler Regional Medical Center 12 Standard 7: Dignity Health partners w ith others in the community to improve the quality of life. Standard 8: Dignity Health employs a variety of approaches, including advocacy, innovation and philanthropy, to address the social, political and economic structures that affect the health of per sons, especially those most vulnerable. Standard 9: Dignity Health exercises responsible stewardship of the environment and partners with others to advance ecological initiatives. Chandler Regional Medical Center's Community Health Committee leads the pl anning process that includes review of all current and potential community benefit programs for alignment with identified significant health needs. Each program is evaluated for effectiveness, potential impact, and the need for continuation, discontinuation, or the need for enhancement. Committee site tours, presentations, and program reports provide additional perspective. In addition to the CHC, Dignity Health leade rship, Community Health department, community partners, and constituency feedback all infl uence prioritization of programs and services identified in the Community Benefit Report and Plan. Feedback is obtained through presentations, ke y informant interviews, surveys and focus groups.

Data a nalytics measure program impact, program efficacy, and reach. Intervention Actions for Achieving Goal Both programs were marketed on hospital website, NaviHealth, physician offices, and at hospitals. Information on both offerings was provided during oth er department programs for community members . Collaboration Dignity Health partnered with Women's Health Innovations of Arizona (WHI) four years ago to provide the six -week therapeutic program, Let's Talk. WHI is a 501(c) (3) organization and the therapi sts considered experts in their field providing a variety of services to families within the community struggling with perinatal mental health. Collaboration with WHI continued throughout 2021. The program received a grant from Mercy Care to fund Let's Ta lk and was able to schedule and run six sessions throughout 2021. Our programs remain a model for CommonSpirit Health. The department continues to provide support as needed to other CommonSpirit Health facilities developing support groups and providing the service online. Performance / Impact The PPSG served 625 clients in 2021. Resources and referrals were provided when appropriate. Participants consistently reported improved success navigating emotional adjustment issues, resources and treatment options , and a sense of community for themselves. Let's Talk served 48 clients in 2021. Program evaluations were excellent. Client outcomes were measured through pre and post session administration of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The EPDS is a 10 -question self -rating scale that has been proven to accurately identify clients at risk for perinatal depression. A score of 10 or greater indicates there is a likelihood of depression. The average score pre session was 11.93. We observed a 2.82 point drop to an average of 9.11 in the post session scores. It is interesting to note with Community Benefit FY 2021 Report and FY 2022 Plan Chandler Regional Medical Center 39 sessions offered prior to the Covid -19 pandemic, a substantially greater decrease in post session scores was often observed. Hospital's Contribution / Program Ex pense For the PPSG two coordinators and/or a department volunteer co - facilitate each week. Time spent facilitating on average is two hours per support group and the coordinator salary was covered by Dignity Health. For the Let's Talk program all expenses this FY were paid by Mercy Care. Total expenditures per six week session were $1,934.40. This covered three hours per week for the Dignity Health program c oordinator to assist with administrative duties and provide support during the weekly sessions, tw o hours for paperwork and documentation of data following the final session, and $1,200 for therapist fee. FY 2022 Plan Program Goal / Anticipated Impact Ultimate goal of both the PPSG and Let's Talk is to provide pregnant and postpartum mothers (and their partner) services and resources as it relates to perinatal mental health. Due to current community spread of Covid- 19 and the increasing incidence of the Delta variant, the programs will continue to be offered online in 2022 until in- person meetings a re deemed to be a safe option. The support and therapy received in these programs will facilitate a decrease in the severity of perinatal mood disorders and isolation for the community members we serve. Measurable Objective(s) with Indicator(s) 1. PPSG c ontinue to offer semi -structured support at least once per week and refer to Let's Talk and/or other appropriate resources as appropriate.
