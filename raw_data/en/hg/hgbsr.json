We systematically identified potentially modifiable targets of obesity at the onset and end of puberty in Hong Kong, the most economically developed major Chinese city. Methods: We conducted an environment-wide association study (EWAS) and an epigenome-wide association study of obesity to systematically assess associations with body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) in Hong Kong's population-representative 'Children of 1997' birth cohort. Univariable linear regression was used to select exposures related to obesity at ~11.5 years (BMI and obesity risk n 7119, WHR n = 5691) and ~17.6 years (n = 3618) at Bonferroni-corrected significance, and multivariable regression to adjust for potential confounders followed by replicated multivariable regression (n = 308) and CpG by CpG analysis (n = 286) at ~23 years. Findings were compared with evidence from published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and Mendelian randomization (MR) studies. Results: At ~11.5 and~17.6 years the EWAS identified 14 and 37 exposures associated with BMI, as well as 7 and 12 associated with WHR, respectively. Most exposures had directionally consistent associations at ~23 years. Maternal second-hand smoking, maternal weight, and birth weight were consistently associated with obesity. Diet (including dairy intake and artificially sweetened beverages), physical activity, snoring, binge eating, and earlier puberty were positively associated with BMI at ~17.6 years, while eating before sleep was inversely associated with BMI at ~17.6 years. Findings for birth weight, dairy intake, and binge eating are consistent with available evidence from RCTs or MR studies. We found 17 CpGs related to BMI and 17 to WHR. Conclusions: These novel insights into potentially modifiable factors associated with obesity at the outset and the end of puberty could, if causal, inform future interventions to improve population health in Hong Kong and similar Chinese settings. Funding: This study including the follow-up survey and epigenetics testing was supported by the Health and Medical Research Fund Research Fellowship, Food and Health Bureau, Hong Kong SAR Government (#04180097). The DNA extraction of the samples used for epigenetic testing was supported by CFS-HKU1. Editor's evaluation This study presents a valuable finding on the association of environmental and epigenomic factors with obesity in the adolescent population, using a specialized cohort. The evidence supporting the claims of the authors is solid, although this study is inevitably open to residual confounding because of the limitation of observational study. The work will be of interest to both clinicians and researchers working on obesity and related metabolic disorders. [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.82377.sa0](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.82377.sa0) Introduction With improving living standards and socioeconomic development, non-communicable chronic diseases pose a heavy burden on society in both developed and developing countries ( [Lozano et al., 2012](#bib40)). Obesity is a well-established risk factor for multiple chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer ( [Gallagher and LeRoith, 2015](#bib19)). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), obesity is defined as 'abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health' ( [World Health Organization, 2000](#bib66)). Body mass index (BMI) is the most appropriate measure for overweight and obesity because the cut-offs account for age, sex, and ethnicity ( [World Health Organization, 2000](#bib66)). Obesity has increased substantially in many settings, including in Hong Kong. Obesity is complicated with multifactorial risk factors, such as socioeconomic position (SEP), mood disturbance, and genetic factors ( [Cardel et al., 2020](#bib8)), so there is a need to evaluate their roles in obesity comprehensively and systematically ( [Manrai et al., 2017](#bib41)). Moreover, given most studies on targets of obesity are conducted in a western setting ( [Cardel et al., 2020](#bib8)), a comprehensive assessment of modifiable factors of early life obesity in a non-western setting, with a different social structure, provides a valuable opportunity to identify novel exposures. Environment-wide association studies (EWAS) enable us to assess a variety of exposures across the human environmental exposome in a high-throughput manner ( [Hall et al., 2013](#bib22)), similar to genome-wide association studies for genetic associations. Previous EWAS have been performed on outcomes, such as type 2 diabetes ( [Patel et al., 2010](#bib47)), cardiovascular disease ( [Zhuang et al., 2018](#bib74)), and childhood obesity in western settings ( [Vrijheid et al., 2020](#bib62); [Uche et al., 2020](#bib60)) but not in a Chinese setting. In the previous EWAS of childhood obesity in the US (6-17 years old), UK, and Europe (6-11 years old), second-hand smoking was related to higher childhood BMI, whilst some other exposures, such as vitamins, were not consistently associated with obesity in these settings ( [Vrijheid et al., 2020](#bib62); [Uche et al., 2020](#bib60)). Observational studies are open to confounding by SEP, thus assessing associations in a different social context can triangulate the evidence concerning early life obesity. In addition to the environmental factors, it is increasingly realized that epigenetic factors, which are also modifiable, may play an important role in obesity ( [Huang et al., 2018a](#bib25)). DNA methylation, which refers to the addition of a methyl group to the 5 position of a cytosine residue of the DNA, is the most frequently examined epigenetic modification ( [Fall et al., 2017](#bib17)). DNA methylation may modulate gene expression and thereby influence susceptibility to obesity or obesity-related chronic disease ( [Fall et al., 2017](#bib17)). Epigenome-wide association study provides an approach to identify the related epigenetic loci in a comprehensive way. For example, DNA methylation at cg06500161 was previously identified as related to obesity in the US ( [Huang et al., 2018a](#bib25)). Unlike genetic variants, DNA methylation is modifiable and may change in response to environmental factors or disease and therefore might be open to confounding by these factors ( [Fall et al., 2017](#bib17); [Fraga et al., 2005](#bib18)). As such, findings from western settings may not be generalizable to Chinese populations. In this situation, Hong Kong, a non-western developed setting, can provide unique insights into health determinants. Most Chinese people in Hong Kong are first-, second-, or third-generation migrants from the neighbouring province of Guangdong in southern China. Dietary habits of people in Hong Kong are similar to those in southern China, although also influenced by western culture ( [Leung et al., 2003](#bib37)). Lifestyle in Hong Kong also differs from more commonly studied western populations on some important attributes, for example, active smoking among Chinese mothers was rare while maternal exposure to second-hand smoking during pregnancy was common before the smoking ban in public and workplaces was implemented in 2007 ( [Lee, 2016](#bib36)). Moreover, most current theories concerning the aetiology of and disparities in chronic diseases originate from observations in long-term developed populations of European descent. However, in Hong Kong the economic transition from pre- to post-industrial living conditions has occurred within one lifetime of the older people ( [Leung et al., 2017](#bib38)), whereas children today in Hong Kong represent the first generation of Chinese to grow up in a post-industrial Chinese setting, which is unrivalled anywhere in the world ( [Schooling et al., 2012](#bib55)). As such, a study in young Chinese people in Hong Kong, a different setting provides 'a sentinel for populations currently experiencing very rapid economic development' ( [Schooling et al., 2016](#bib56)), which may help identify whether these associations reflect SEP within a specific context or are biologically based as well as having the potential to identify any attributes relevant to the majority of the global population but not necessarily evident in more commonly studied western populations, such as maternal birthplace ( [Schooling et al., 2010](#bib54)). For example, in the 'Children of 1997' birth cohort, a large cohort in Hong Kong, the associations of sugar-sweetened beverages ( [Zhang et al., 2020](#bib72)), al., 2012](#bib39)), sleep duration ( [Wang et 2019](#bib64)), and parental smoking ( [Kwok et al., 2010](#bib32)) with childhood and adolescent obesity have been examined, with some important differences detected. The associations for breastfeeding in Hong Kong are much more similar to those seen in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) than those typically seen in western settings ( [Hui et al., 2018](#bib27)). To take advantage of this unique setting, we conducted an environment- and epigenome-wide association study, to identify further potential drivers of obesity. We focused on puberty because it is an important stage involving a re-orientation from childhood priorities to adulthood ( [Karlberg, 1989](#bib28)). Exposures associated with obesity at puberty may be important for health in later life ( [Richardson et al., 2020](#bib50)). Considering that exposures related to obesity at the outset and at the end of puberty may be different, and the associations of the same exposure with obesity may vary by age, we conducted the EWAS at the onset and the end of puberty. Methods Participants The study takes advantage of the 'Children of 1997' birth cohort, a large (n = 8327) population-representative Chinese cohort in Hong Kong ( [Schooling et al., 2012](#bib55)). The participants were originally recruited shortly after birth in April and May 1997 at all of the 49 Maternal and Child Health Centers (MCHCs) in Hong Kong, which provide free check-ups and immunizations. The study included 88% of births in the relevant period. A self-administered questionnaire in Chinese was used at baseline to collect information on family, education, birth characteristics, infant feeding, and second-hand smoke exposure. The initial study was designed to provide a short-term assessment of the effects of second-hand smoking and included follow-up via the MCHCs until 18 months. In 2005, funded by the Health and Health Services Research Fund (HHSRF) and Health and Medical Research Fund (HMRF) we extended the information on this cohort via record linkage to include infant characteristics, serious morbidity, childhood obesity, pubertal development, history of migration, and SEP; with regular updates on subsequent growth obtained from the Student Health Service, including annual height and weight measurements from age ~6 years, and in this study, we used height and weight at age ~11.5 years. In 2007, with support from The University of Hong Kong University Research Committee Strategic Research Theme of Public Health, we instituted a program to re-establish and maintain direct contact with the cohort through direct mailing (newsletters, birthday cards, and seasonal cards) and the mass media (press conference and a full-length television documentary). We have since conducted three questionnaires/telephone surveys and an in-person Biobank Clinical follow-up in one visit at age ~17.6 years (Phase 1 in 2013-2016 included 3460 people with mean age 17.5 years and Phase 2 in the second half of 2017 included 158 people at mean age 19.5 years) with their blood samples stored. In 2020 (at age ~23 years), we conducted a follow-up survey to obtain updated information on anthropometric measurements. The number of participants in each age is shown in [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/82377/figures#fig1s1). Outcomes At ~11.5 years, BMI was calculated from height and weight measurements records provided by the Student Health Service, the Department of Health. Waist-hip ratio (WHR) was calculated based on waist and hip circumference collected in Survey I conducted in 2008-2009. At ~17.6 years, in both phases of the Biobank Clinical follow-up, BMI was assessed by bio-electrical impedance analysis (BIA) with a Tanita segmental body composition monitor (Tanita BC-545, Tanita Co, Tokyo, Japan). Waist and hip circumference measurements were made using a tape twice following a standard protocol by trained technicians and nurses. Given BMI has a more accepted cut-off value than WHR for children, we classified obesity as BMI 20.89 kg/m2 for boys and BMI for men and at age 17.6 ( [Cole et al., 2000](#bib11)). In the follow-up survey at ~23 years, questionnaires were sent to 700 participants randomly selected from those with blood samples available and with BMI below the 25th centile or above the 75th centile. The questionnaires were accompanied by clear instructions on anthropometric measurement and a tape measure (the same as used in the Biobank Clinical follow-up). In total, 308 participants replied and provided their waist, hip, height, and body weight. Assessment of DNA methylation DNA methylation was conducted in 286 participants randomly selected from the 308 participants in the follow-up survey. DNA were extracted from buffy coat samples previously stored at 80\u00b0 using EZI DNA blood kit (QIAGEN) with magnetic particle technology. DNA methylation was assessed using the Illumina Methylation EPIC Beadchip, which interrogated the methylation status of over 850,000 CpG sites. We conducted quality control using the 'ewastools' package ( [Heiss and Just, 2018](#bib23)), which included an evaluation of control metrics monitoring the various experimental steps, such as bisulfite conversion or staining and a sex check comparing actual sex to the records. After sample-level quality control, we excluded two samples that had a sex mismatch, so 286 samples (168 women and 118 men) were included in the analysis. We corrected for dye bias using RELIC ( [Xu et al., 2017](#bib69)), without normalization. At the probe level, we excluded non-CpG probes and probes located on the sex chromosomes; a total of 843,393 probes remained for analyses. Exposures and categorization [Supplementary file 1](/articles/82377/figures#supp1) shows exposure categorization and data sources. After excluding exposures with missing values 50%, we included 123 exposures for BMI and 115 exposures for WHR at ~11.5 years, and 441 exposures for BMI and WHR at ~17.6 years using information from the original study, record linkage, the three surveys, that is Survey I (2008-2009), Survey II (2010-2012), and Survey III (2011-2012), as well as the Biobank Clinical follow-up. The exposures considered for obesity at ~11.5 years were classified into 12 categories, including baseline characteristics, SEP, family history, paternal information, maternal information, infant feeding and caring, diet (measured at Survey I at ~11.5 years old), health status (referring to physical health condition; details of the questions can be found in [Supplementary file 1](/articles/82377/figures#supp1)), parents' health status, physical activity, lifestyle, and home facilities and pets. The exposures at 17.6 years were classified into 16 categories: baseline characteristics, SEP, family history, paternal information, maternal information, infant feeding and caring, diet (measured at the Biobank Clinical follow-up at ~17.6 years), children's use of medications, children's health status, parent's health status, physical activity, home facilities and pets, moods and feelings, academic performance, sleep, and pubertal timing. Statistical analysis In the EWAS, similar to genome-wide association studies ( [Barrera-G\u00f3mez et al., 2017](#bib3)), first we used univariable linear regression to assess associations of each of the exposures with the measures of obesity at ages ~11.5 and ~17.6 years. We conducted the analysis in people with both exposure and outcome available, specifically, in up to 7119 participants for BMI at ~11.5 years, 5691 participants for WHR at ~11.5 participants for BMI and WHR at ~17.6 years; their baseline characteristics at different ages are shown in [Table 1](#table1). We only considered exposures reaching Bonferroni-corrected significance (e.g. p < 0.05/441 = 1.2 \u00d7 104 for obesity at ~17.6 years) to account for multiple testing ( [Curtin and Schulz, 1998](#bib13)). Second, we used multivariable linear regression controlling for potential confounders (sex, housing type at birth, household income at birth, maternal second-hand smoking during pregnancy, maternal age at birth, maternal education, maternal birth place, and the interaction of maternal education with maternal birthplace [ [Schooling et al., 2010](#bib54)]) at age ~11.5 and ~17.6 years, and excluded exposures that had over 50% of change-in-estimates ratios ( [Lee, 2014](#bib35)). Third, to assess whether the associations differed by age, we checked the associations for the selected exposures from the earlier age groups (~11.5 and ~17.6 years) in the follow-up survey (n = 308) at age ~23 years and compared the direction of associations with those at earlier age groups (~11.5 and ~17.6 years). Associations with consistent directions of associations in earlier age groups (~11.5 or ~17.6 years) with those at ~23 years suggest a consistent association by age. Additionally, to account for the time lag between the age at which physical measurements were taken and age at exposure collection, we included a time difference variable in the adjusted models for BMI. Finally, exposures that remained after controlling for confounders, were compared with the evidence from existing RCTs and Mendelian randomization (MR) studies, a study design which uses genetic variants as instrument and provides less confounded associations ( [Smith and Ebrahim, 2003](#bib58)). In methylation beta-values ( [Du et al., 2010](#bib16)), we used robust linear regression models to assess the epigenome-wide association of each CpG with BMI and WHR at age ~23 years. We adjusted for age at blood draw for DNA methylation, age at follow-up survey, sex, cell type proportion, methylation assay batches, maternal second-hand smoking during pregnancy, maternal education, maternal birthplace, and household income at birth. The significance was considered as p < 1 \u00d7 106, genome-wide significance (5 \u00d7 108) was not used given the relatively small sample size in the epigenome-wide association study. To estimate genomic inflation, we used a Bayesian method that estimates inflation more accurately in epigenome-wide association studies based on the empirical null distributions ( [van Iterson et al., 2017](#bib61)), implemented using the R package 'bacon'. Ethical approval This study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki. Since our participants are children, informed (non-written) consent for the original survey and subsequent record linkage was obtained from the parents, next of kin, caretakers, or guardians (informants) on behalf of the participants by the informant agreeing and subsequently completing the questionnaire at enrollment, this manner of obtaining consent was approved by The University of Hong Kong Medical Faculty Ethics Committee over 20 years ago. Informed written consent for subsequent Surveys and in-person follow-up was obtained from a parent or guardian, or at ages 18+ years from the participant. Ethical approval for this study, including the follow-up survey at ~23 years and comprehensive health-related analyses, was obtained from the University of Hong Kong-Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster, Joint Institutional Review Board, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China (reference numbers: UW13-367; UW19-367). Results [Figures 1](#fig1) and [2](#fig2) show the of each exposure with BMI and WHR at ~11.5 and ~17.6 years. At ~11.5 years, 18 associations with BMI and 19 associations with WHR remained after Bonferroni correction ( [Figure 1](#fig1)). Of these 18 associations with BMI, 14 associations with BMI remained after controlling for confounders, 13 showed significant association with obesity risk at 11.5 years, and 11 exposures had concordant direction of associations with BMI at ~23 years ( [Table 2](#table2)). Of the 19 associations with WHR at ~11.5 years, 7 exposures remained after controlling for confounders, and 6 had the same direction of association with WHR at ~23 years ( [Table 3](#table3)). At ~17.6 years, 37 associations with BMI with WHR remained after Bonferroni correction ( [Figure 2](#fig2)). Of these 37 associations with BMI, all remained after controlling for confounders, 27 exposures were associated with obesity risk, and 32 exposures had the same direction of association with BMI at ~23 years ( [Table 4](#table4)). Of the 19 associations with WHR at ~17.6 years, 12 remained after controlling for confounders, and 7 had the same directions of association with WHR at ~23 years ( [Table 5](#table5)). [see all](/articles/82377/figures#fig1) Specifically, for obesity at ~11.5 years, we found sex (being male), higher birth weight, maternal second-hand smoking, higher parental weight, family history of diabetes, gestational diabetes, and more water consumption were associated with higher BMI, while being small for gestational age and spending more time having meals were associated with lower BMI at ~11.5 years ( [Table 2](#table2)). Except for paternal diabetes which was not significant, the rest of exposures all showed consistent associations with obesity risk ( [Table 2](#table2)). However, the associations for family history of diabetes and time spent on meals showed inconsistent directions of associations for BMI ~23 years ( [Table 2](#table2)). Regarding WHR, the associations were generally consistent with those seen for BMI and showed consistent directions of associations with those at ~17.6 and ~23 years, except for maternal diabetes ( [Table 3](#table3)). For obesity at ~17.6 years, in addition to some shared factors, including sex, birth weight, parental weight, and maternal second-hand smoking, we found some aspects of diet (i.e. more artificially sweetened beverage [ASB], lower-sugar soy milk, reduced-fat/skim milk, Chinese herbal tea, Chinese tea, energy drinks, coffee, and fish consumptions), physical activity, health status (i.e. diabetes, growth problem and snoring), earlier puberty and binge eating associated with higher BMI at ~17.6 years ( [Table 4](#table4)). Being a twin, sweets consumption, chocolate consumption, eating before sleep, and having bad dreams were associated with lower BMI at ~17.6 years ( [Table 4](#table4)). Regarding the association with obesity risk at 17.6 years, birth weight, being a twin, maternal second-hand smoking, physical activity, and energy drinks intake were not significant but the direction of association was consistent ( [Table 4](#table4)). In addition, most exposures had the same direction of association at ~23 years. However, the association of chocolate consumption with BMI at ~23 years was in the other direction. Regarding WHR, the associations were generally consistent with those seen for BMI. Sex, drinking ASB, children's health status, and coughing or snoring during sleep were also related to WHR at ~17.6 and ~23 years ( [Table 5](#table5)). The of selected exposures with BMI at ~11.5 and ~17.6 years were similar after adjusting for the time difference between age at anthropometric measurements and age of exposure collection. Regarding the comparison with RCTs and MR studies, we found RCTs on dark chocolate consumption ( [Kord-Varkaneh et al., 2019](#bib30)), water consumption promotion ( [Muckelbauer et al., 2009](#bib44)), and physical activity ( [Bleich et al., 2018](#bib5)), and MR studies related to drinking coffee ( [Nordestgaard et al., 2015](#bib46)), dairy intake ( [Huang 2018b](#bib26)), binge [Reed birth [Zanetti et and maternal 2022](#bib6); [Richmond et al., 2017](#bib51); [Table 6](#table6)). The available evidence from both RCTs and MR studies show that more physical activity lowers BMI ( [Bleich et al., 2018](#bib5)), and MR studies also suggest that dairy intake ( [Yang et al., 2017](#bib70); [Huang et al., 2018b](#bib26)) and binge eating ( [Reed et al., 2017](#bib49)) are associated with higher BMI. In the epigenome-wide association study of 286 participants we identified 17 CpGs for BMI at ~23 was a shared CpG for both BMI and WHR. The genetic inflation factors (lambda) were 1.006 and 1.005, respectively. Discussion In this environment- and epigenome-wide association study, we systematically examined associations of over 400 exposures with obesity in a unique Chinese birth cohort, as well as the association of DNA methylation with obesity. Building on the previous studies in this birth cohort ( [Zhang et al., 2020](#bib72); [Hui et al., 2012](#bib39); [Kwok et al., 2010](#bib32)), we not only confirmed established risk factors, such as maternal second-hand smoking ( [Wang et al., 2014](#bib63)), but also added by identifying novel exposures not reported in previous EWAS in western settings ( [Vrijheid et al., 2020](#bib62); [Uche et al., 2020](#bib60)), such as consumption of ASB and soymilk. The comparison with RCTs or MR studies support a role of higher birth weight, dairy intake, binge eating, and possibly earlier puberty in obesity. We also identified several CpGs related to BMI and WHR in young Chinese, as reported in other populations ( [Kval\u00f8y et al., 2018](#bib31)). Our study found that maternal second-hand smoking was consistently associated with obesity at different ages, which is consistent with the concerns repeatedly raised in previous studies ( [Kwok et al., 2010](#bib32); [Wang et al., 2014](#bib63)), and adds support to the policy of banning smoking cigarettes and alternative smoking products in all indoor areas including workplaces and public places, as well as certain outdoor areas, such as open areas of schools, leisure facilities, bathing beaches, and public transport facilities in Hong Kong ( [WSC, 2022](#bib67)). Maternal weight is another maternal factor related to higher BMI and WHR consistently at different ages before adulthood. However, recent MR studies do not support a role of maternal overweight in offspring obesity ( [Bond et al., 2022](#bib6); [Richmond et al., 2017](#bib51)). Gestational diabetes was also identified to be associated with obesity at ~11.5 years, and the positive association remained for obesity at ~17.6 and ~23 years. It would be worthwhile to test its role in MR studies. Regarding dietary factors, as the dietary assessments were more comprehensively conducted in the Biobank Clinical follow-up, the identified dietary factors were mainly for obesity at ~17.6 years. Interestingly, we found that children who consume more ASB have higher BMI, which is consistent with meta-analyses of cohort studies ( [Qin et al., 2020](#bib48); [Rousham et al., 2022](#bib53)). Consistent with a previous study in this birth cohort ( [Zhang et al., 2020](#bib72)), we did not find an association of sugar-sweetened beverages with obesity. The different associations for ASB and sugar-sweetened beverages might be because few consumed sugar-sweetened beverages regularly (6.8% consumed daily) ( [Zhang et al., 2020](#bib72)), while many consumed ASB (43% participants reported consumption). Consistent with our EWAS, an EWAS in the US also found that consumption of aspartame, a synthetic non-nutritive sweetener, was positively associated with abdominal obesity ( [Wulaningsih et al., 2017](#bib68)). ASB intake may induce appetite for similar sweet foods, leading to excess energy intake ( [Mattes and Popkin, 2009](#bib42)). The consistency across settings suggests this association is less likely to be confounded. However, whether it can be used as a target of intervention needs to be tested in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial ( [Rousham et al., 2022](#bib53)). Another interesting finding is that milk consumption was not related to obesity at ~11.5 years, while reduced-fat/skim milk consumption was associated with higher BMI at ~17.6 years, with a consistent direction of associations for BMI at ~23 years. Our findings are consistent with a previous study in this cohort, which showed milk consumption frequency was not associated with BMI at 13 years ( [Lin et al., 2012](#bib39)), however, the previous study did not assess the specific type of milk. Our findings are different from a cross-sectional study in Portugal which shows more skimmed or semi-skimmed milk consumption was associated with lower abdominal obesity ( [Abreu et al., 2014](#bib1)). An explanation is that the observed associations of reduced-fat or skim milk with higher BMI could be due to increased muscle mass rather than body fat mass, or residual confounding by SEP. Alternatively, it might be due to reverse causality as young people with higher BMI might be more motivated to consume a specific diet. Interestingly, our findings are more consistent with an MR study suggesting genetically predicted higher dairy intake was associated with higher BMI ( [Huang et al., 2018b](#bib26)). We also found tea or coffee consumption were associated with higher BMI at ~17.6 years. RCTs of coffee or tea consumption are scarce among children and adolescents because they require long-term adherence. MR studies do not suggest that coffee consumption affects obesity ( [Nordestgaard et al., 2015](#bib46); [Cornelis and Munafo, 2018](#bib12)), so the observed association might be due to confounding or chance. Similarly, the associations of chocolate and sweets intake with lower BMI at ~17.6 years, as well as physical activity with higher BMI at ~17.6 years are not consistent with RCTs of dark chocolate consumption ( [Kord-Varkaneh et al., 2019](#bib30)) and physical activity ( [Bleich et al., 2018](#bib5)), or MR studies of physical activity ( [Carrasquilla et al., 2022](#bib9)), and might be due to confounding or reverse causality. Echoing the increasing attention to the role of mood and emotion in obesity control ( [Cardel et al., 2020](#bib8)), we found that binge eating was associated with higher BMI at ~17.6 years, with a consistent direction of association in the follow-up, consistent with an MR study ( [Reed et al., 2017](#bib49)). Our findings are also in line with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance which also included binge eating in the consideration of children's weight management ( [NICE, 2013](#bib45)). The underlying mechanism has not been clarified, but in general mental wellbeing may be linked to obesity via the neurohormonal weight control network concerning the hypothalamus ( [Sharma and Kavuru, 2010](#bib57); [Spiegel et al., 2009](#bib59)) as well as via psychosocial factors, lifestyle and behaviour. As regards lifestyle, consistent with previous observational studies ( [Wang et al., 2019](#bib64)), we found sleep might play a role in childhood obesity at ~17.6 years. Despite a lack of RCTs, MR findings suggest sleep deprivation may be a causal factor for obesity ( [Wang et al., 2019](#bib64); [Dashti and Ordov\u00e1s, 2021](#bib14)). Our study also shows coughing or snoring at night had a positive association with childhood BMI and WHR, which has not been identified in previous EWAS ( [Vrijheid et al., 2020](#bib62); [Uche et al., 2020](#bib60)). MR studies suggest genetically predicted BMI is positively associated with snoring ( [Campos et al., 2020](#bib7)), while the association of snoring with BMI is less clear. As such, we cannot exclude the possibility of reverse causality in our observation. Consistent with previous studies ( [Lai et al., 2021](#bib34)), we found that earlier pubertal age for girls was related to higher BMI at ~17.6 years. Consistently, a previous study in this birth cohort suggested that maternal age at puberty was associated with offspring BMI at puberty ( [Lai et al., 2016](#bib33)). However, the findings from MR studies are controversial, with evidence showing genetically predicted earlier age at puberty related to higher BMI ( [Gill et al., 2018](#bib21)) while another MR study showing puberty timing has a small influence on BMI ( [Bell et al., 2018](#bib4)). Meanwhile, we cannot exclude a relation in the other direction ( [Chen et al., 2019](#bib10)); clarifying the bi-directional association would be worthwhile in future studies. In the epigenome-wide association study, we found DNA methylation at RPS6KA2 was associated with both BMI and WHR, consistent with the previous epigenome-wide association studies of obesity in different populations ( [Kval\u00f8y et al., 2018](#bib31)). Our study also identified several other genes, such as ZNF827, MIR7641-2, RAPTOR, KSR1, GTF3C3, and NFIC, whose role in obesity or obesity-related disorders has been consistently shown in previous studies. For example, ZNF827, MIR7641-2, and RAPTOR have been reported to be related to obesity ( [Huang et al., 2015](#bib24); [Dong et ( [Morris et al., 2015](#bib43)). KSR1 has been reported to be related to the regulation of glucose homeostasis ( [Klutho et al., 2017](#bib73)). Opa3, a novel regulator of mitochondrial function, controls thermogenesis and abdominal fat mass ( [Wells et al., 2012](#bib65)). The consistency of our study with other studies in different settings with different confounding structures suggests these association are less likely to be a product of confounding. Strengths and limitations To our knowledge, this study is the first study comprehensively assessing environmental factors related to obesity at the outset and at end of puberty in Asians, including some exposures specifically relevant in Asians, such as soymilk intake. We also replicated the associations in a follow-up survey and compared our findings with those from studies of different designs. Nevertheless, several limitations exist. First, the sample size for the EWAS and epigenome-wide association study is relatively small. Replication in a larger study is needed. The evidence from RCTs and MR is mainly in adults, which restricted the comparison with our findings. For better comparison, evidence from RCTs and MR conducted at similar ages are needed. Second, misclassification is possible for the exposures, which typically biases towards the null ( [Rothman, 2008](#bib52)). The use of questionnaires to ascertain exposures is prone to recall bias and social desirability bias, however, some previous studies within this cohort have suggested accurate reporting ( [Kwok et al., 2010](#bib32)). To minimize these possible biases, exposures measurements were collected using standard protocols and equipment with clear instructions. After accounting for the time difference between age at anthropometric measurements and age of exposure collection, we also obtained similar results. Third, we obtained similar results for BMI and obesity risk, however, given the lack of high-quality evidence about the cut-off values for waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio in Asian children and adolescents, we did not perform logistic regression on central obesity risk. Fourth, the inconsistency between some of our findings and previous studies, such as chocolate, sweets, tea, and coffee consumption, should be interpreted cautiously. It may not only reflect differences between the West and China (Hong Kong), but also may be due to changes in structural socioeconomic and environmental factors, as well as changes in living environment, family relationships, social and community networks, housing and the care environment. Fifth, we only collected blood samples at the Biobank Clinical follow-up (age ~17.6 years), so we only conducted the epigenome-wide association study for DNA methylation at ~17.6 years. It would be worthwhile to examine the association of DNA methylation at different ages with obesity. Finally, although we controlled for several confounders in the multivariable analysis, residual confounding may still exist given our study is observational. Comparing our study with evidence from MR studies which are less likely to be confounded ( [Reed et al., al., 2018](#bib4); [Chen et al., 2019](#bib10)), we found a consistent direction of association for dairy intake ( [Huang et al., 2018b](#bib26)) and binge eating ( [Reed et al., 2017](#bib49)) being associated with higher BMI. Evidence for some exposures, such as tea and chocolate consumption, is still lacking; further MR studies are needed to assess causality. Implications In this study, we not only confirmed established risk factors, such as maternal second-hand smoking, but also identified several factors not reported or not examined in previous EWAS in western countries ( [Vrijheid et al., 2020](#bib62); [Uche et al., 2020](#bib60)), such as ASB consumption and soymilk intake. The comparison with RCTs or MR studies to some extent supports a role of dairy intake and binge eating, suggesting these factors or their drivers (e.g., sex hormones as a potential driver of binge eating) might be considered as potential targets for intervention. Other factors, such as soymilk intake, need to be tested in RCTs. We also identified several methylation loci related to obesity. Our study based on the unique setting in Hong Kong, provides potential drivers of obesity applicable to Hong Kong Chinese, with relevance to health policy interventions and future research. Conclusions This study takes advantage of the unique setting of Hong Kong and provides more insight about the role of environmental exposures and epigenetics in early life obesity. If these associations are found to be causal, they may provide novel intervention targets to improve population health.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work. Decision letter after peer review: Thank you for submitting your article \"Environment-wide and epigenome-wide association study of adiposity in \"Children of 1997\" birth cohort\" for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Essential revisions: 1. The authors analyzed the association between exposures and obesity using linear regression. It is recommended to additionally perform logistic regression by converting BMI and waist circumference into binary dependent variables. Appropriate scientific evidence for cut-off values of BMI and waist circumference in adolescence and adulthood, respectively, should be provided. Regarding waist circumference, it is necessary to consider the cut-off value of each male and female. 2. The authors used a false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05 as the significance threshold for the epigenome-wide association study. However, considering the previous studies including 'Rakyan VK, et al. Epigenome-wide association studies for common human diseases. Nat Rev Genet 2011', it is appropriate to use a significance threshold between E-08 to E-06 for epigenome-wide association studies. If the sample size is not sufficient to proceed with the analysis using these significance thresholds, it is appropriate to delete the epigenome-wide association study from the manuscript. 3. In the limitations of this study, the authors used the following expression: \"... despite the minimal level of confounding in this cohort...\" In presenting the limitations of this study, the authors used the following expression: \"despite the minimal level of confounding in this cohort\" Considering the following points, this expression is wrong: This is an observational study, and a large amount of confounding effect should be considered on the association between obesity and exposures analyzed in this study including diet, physical activity, mood and feelings, family history, and socioeconomic status. Since the confounders considered in the multivariable analysis are very limited, the possibility of residual confounding remains large. These limitations should be detailed in the discussion. 4. Since the outcome variables were measured by body mass index and waist-hip ratio, it is more appropriate to use the term \"obesity\" rather than \"adiposity\". It is recommended that the term \"adiposity\" used in the manuscript be changed to \"obesity\". 5. Only part of the analysis code is presented, not the entire code. The whole analysis code used for the actual analysis needs to be provided. 6. Provide information regarding definition of obesity according to age. 7. Provide general population characteristics of each age group (height, weight and z-score percentiles) 8. Provide the time difference between the age at the time of physical measurement and age at the exposure (survey period) and consider to include as variable. 9. Provide the basis for expressing onset and at end of puberty. 10. Change the term 'health' to another term as it is inappropriate to list (diabetes, growth problem...) etc. 11. Modify the way the table is organized and correct the order of variable description in table. For example, make two tables 4 and 5 into one, and check the order of enumeration of variables (the order of variables is different while comparing similar contents by age group, it must be corrected because it reduces readability) Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors): 1.

The authors analyzed the association between exposures and obesity using linear regression. It is recommended to additionally perform logistic regression by converting BMI and waist circumference into binary dependent variables. Appropriate scientific evidence for cut-off values of BMI and waist circumference in adolescence and adulthood, respectively, should be provided. Regarding waist circumference, it is necessary to consider the cut-off value of each male and female. Thank you very much for your helpful comments. In the environment-wide association study, we used BMI, a continuous outcome, to maximize power in the selection of exposures passing Bonferroni-corrected significance. Then we examined the associations of these exposures with BMI after controlling for confounders in multivariable regression. Following your suggestions, in the multivariable regression, we converted BMI into a binary outcome (i.e., obesity) and performed logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders. We adopted the obesity cut-off values of BMI for different age groups with sex-specific at age 11.5 kg/m2 for men and BMI 24.85 kg/m2 for women at age 17.6 The directions of associations are consistent with those using BMI as continuous outcome, the comparisons are shown in Table 2 and Table 4. It would be interesting to explore the associations with central obesity as a binary outcome as well, however, given the lack of high-quality evidence about the cut-off values for waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio in Asian children and adolescents, we did not perform logistic regression on central obesity risk. We have revised the methods and results: (Methods, paragraph 2) We added \"Given BMI has a more accepted cut-off value than WHR for children, we classified obesity as BMI 20.89 kg/m2 for boys and BMI for men and BMI 24.85 kg/m2 for women at age 17.6 (1).\" We updated Tables 2 and Table 4: (Results, paragraph 2) \"Except for paternal diabetes which was not significant, the rest of exposures all showed consistent associations with obesity risk (Table 2).\" (Results, paragraph 3) \"Regarding the association with obesity risk at 17.6 years, birth weight, being a twin, maternal second-hand smoking, physical activity and energy drinks intake were not significant but the directions of associations are consistent (Table 4).\" We added in the discussion: (Discussion, Strengths and Limitations) \"Third, we obtained similar results for BMI and obesity risk, however, given the lack of high-quality evidence about the cut-off values for waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio in Asian children and adolescents, we did not perform logistic regression on central obesity risk.\" 2. The authors used a false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05 as the significance threshold for the epigenome-wide association study. However, considering the previous studies including 'Rakyan VK, et al. Epigenome-wide association studies for common human diseases. Nat Rev Genet 2011', it is appropriate to use a significance threshold between E-08 to E-06 for epigenome-wide association studies. If the sample size is not sufficient to proceed with the analysis using these significance thresholds, it is appropriate to delete the epigenome-wide association study from the manuscript. Thank you for your helpful suggestion. We have changed the threshold to 1\u00d710-6 in the epigenome-wide association study, and updated the methods and results accordingly. (Methods-statistical analysis, paragraph 2) We revised to \"The significance was considered as p<1\u00d710-6, genome-wide significance (5\u00d710-8) was not used given the relatively small sample size in the epigenome-wide association study.\" (Results, paragraph 5) We revised to \"In the epigenome-wide association study of 286 participants we identified 17 CpGs for BMI at ~23 Figures 3-4).\" 3. In the limitations of this study, the authors used the following expression: \"... despite the minimal level of confounding in this cohort...\" In presenting the limitations of this study, the authors used the following expression: \"despite the minimal level of confounding in this cohort\" Considering the following points, this expression is wrong: This is an observational study, and a large amount of confounding effect should be considered on the association between obesity and exposures analyzed in this study including diet, physical activity, mood and feelings, family history, and socioeconomic status. Since the confounders considered in the multivariable analysis are very limited, the possibility of residual confounding remains large. These limitations should be detailed in the discussion. Thank you very much for your very helpful suggestion, we totally agree that our study is an observational study and inevitably open to residual confounding, although we have controlled for sex, housing type at birth, household income at birth, maternal second-hand smoking during pregnancy, maternal age at birth, maternal education, maternal birthplace, and the interaction of maternal education with maternal birthplace. So, we also compared the associations from multivariable regression with available evidence from Mendelian randomization studies, which uses genetic variants as instrument to minimize confounding. We have added more in the discussion. (Discussion, Strengths and Limitations) We revised from: \"Finally, despite the minimal level of confounding in this cohort for some key exposures, such as breastfeeding, residual confounding likely exists, so the associations are not definitive.\" To: \"Finally, although we controlled for several confounders in the multivariable analysis, residual confounding may still exist given our study is observational. Comparing our study with evidence from MR studies which are less likely to be confounded (2-5), we found a consistent direction of association for dairy intake (39) and binge eating (40) being associated with higher BMI. Evidence for some exposures, such as tea and chocolate consumption, is still lacking; further MR studies are needed to assess causality.\" 4. Since the outcome variables were measured by body mass index and waist-hip ratio, it is more appropriate to use the term \"obesity\" rather than \"adiposity\". It is recommended that the term \"adiposity\" used in the manuscript be changed to \"obesity\". Thank you very much for your very helpful suggestion. We have changed the term \"adiposity\" to \"obesity\" in the manuscript throughout. 5. Only part of the analysis code is presented, not the entire code. The whole analysis code used for the actual analysis needs to be provided. Thank you very much for your comments. We previously showed part of the analysis code in the environment-wide association study because the analysis code is similar for BMI and WHR, and for different ages. As you suggested, we have uploaded the whole analysis code along with the revised manuscript. Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors): Please provide information regarding definition of adiposity according to age. Thank you very much for your helpful suggestion. We added the definition of obesity by the World Health Organization (WHO), and also addressed the cut-off values specific to Asian population by age and by sex. (Introduction, paragraph 1) \"Obesity is a well-established risk factor for multiple chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer (6). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), obesity is defined as \"abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health\" (7). Body mass index (BMI) is the most appropriate measure for overweight and obesity because the cut-offs account for age, sex, and ethnicity (7). Obesity has increased substantially in many settings, including Hong Kong...\" We clarified the obesity cut-off by adding the following sentence: (Methods, Outcomes) \"Given BMI has a more accepted cut-off value than WHR for children, we classified obesity as BMI 20.89 kg/m2 for boys and BMI for men and BMI 24.85 kg/m2 for women at age 17.6 (1).\" Please provide general population characteristics of each age group (height, weight and z-score percentiles) Thank you very much for your helpful suggestion. We have added information of each age group (height, weight, etc) in Table 1. Please provide the time difference between the age at the time of physical measurement and age at the exposure (survey period) and consider to include as variable. Thank you very much for your suggestions. We understand that the time difference between the age at the time of physical measurement and age at the exposure (time of survey period) is an important aspect and sometimes may lead to imprecision in measurement in large cohort studies. The Biobank Clinical follow-up at 17.6 years involved collecting questionnaires from children and parents, and anthropometric measurements from participants in one visit, so the time difference is minimal. However, for exposures collected at baseline and the Survey I, there may be a difference between the age at which physical measurements were taken and age at the exposure. To address this issue, we included a variable for the time differences associated with these exposures, and results were similar after including the time difference variable (Supplementary file 2). We added the following sentences in the Methods and Results: (Methods, Statistical analysis) \"Additionally, to account for the time lag between the age at which physical measurements were taken and age at exposure collection, we included a time difference variable in the adjusted models for BMI.\" (Results, paragraph 3) \"The associations of selected exposures with BMI at ~11.5 years and at 17.6 years were similar after adjusting for the time difference between age at anthropometric measurements and age of exposure collection (Supplementary file 2).\" (Discussion, Strength and Limitations) We added: \"After accounting for the time difference between age at anthropometric measurements and age of exposure collection, we also obtained similar results.\" Please provide the basis for expressing onset and at end of puberty. Thank you very much for raising this question. We considered puberty because puberty is an important stage which involves a re-orientation from childhood priorities to adulthood (24). Exposures associated with adiposity at puberty may be important for health in later life (25). We considered onset and at the end of puberty separately, because due to the changes in hormones during puberty, exposures related to obesity at the onset and at the end of puberty may be different, the same exposure may also have different effects on obesity. We added more explanation in the Introduction section: (Introduction, paragraph 4) \"We focused on puberty because it is an important stage involving a re-orientation from childhood priorities to adulthood (24). Exposures associated with obesity at puberty may be important for health in later life (25). Considering that exposures related to obesity at the outset and at the end of puberty may be different, and the associations of the same exposure with obesity may vary by age, we conducted the EWAS at different ages.\" Please changed the term 'health' to another term as it is inappropriate to list (diabetes, growth problem...) etc. Thank you very much for pointing out the inappropriate term, we have incorporated your suggestion throughout the manuscript by changing 'health' into 'health status', with a note that the term here refers to physical health condition. Please refer to the tracked changes in the revised manuscript (Exposures and categorization of Methods) and revised Supplementary file 1, Figures 1 and 2. (Methods, Exposures and categorization) We revised to \"The exposures considered ... child's health status (referring to physical health condition; detail questionnaire questions about this can be found in Supplementary file 1), parents' health status,...\" Please modify the way the table is organized and correct the order of variable description in table. For example, make two tables 4 and 5 into one, and check the order of enumeration of variables (the order of variables is different while comparing similar contents by age group, it must be corrected because it reduces readability) Thank you very much for this suggestion, we have incorporated your suggestion and reorganized the tables by combining Tables 2 and 3, Tables 4 and 5, Tables 6 and 7, Tables 8 and 9.

There is an urgent need for easily implementable and clinically effective Early Warning Scores (EWSs) that can predict the risk of complications within the next 24-48 hr. Although EWSs have been used in the evaluation of COVID-19 patients, there are several clinical limitations to their use. Moreover, no models have been tested on geographically distinct populations or population groups with varying levels of immune protection. Methods: We developed and validated COVID-19 Early Warning Score (COEWS), an EWS that is automatically calculated solely from laboratory parameters that are widely available and affordable. We benchmarked COEWS against the widely used NEWS2. We also evaluated the predictive performance of vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Results: The variables of the COEWS predictive model were selected based on their predictive coefficients and on the wide availability of these laboratory variables. The final model included complete blood count, blood glucose, and oxygen saturation features. To make COEWS more actionable in real clinical situations, we transformed the predictive coefficients of the COEWS model into individual scores for each selected feature. The global score serves as an easy-to-calculate measure indicating the risk of a patient developing the combined outcome of mechanical ventilation or death within the next 48 hr. The discrimination in the external validation cohort was 0.743 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.703-0.784) (95% CI: 0.654-0.745) for the COEWS performed with scores. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was similar in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Additionally, we observed that the AUROC of the NEWS2 was 0.677 in unvaccinated patients. Conclusions: The COEWS score predicts death or MV within the next 48 hr based on routine and widely available laboratory measurements. The extensive external validation, its high performance, its ease of use, and its positive benchmark in comparison with the widely used NEWS2 position COEWS as a new reference tool for assisting clinical decisions and improving patient care in the upcoming pandemic waves.

Therefore, in this mixed methods study we explored perceived pandemic-related practice changes to cervical cancer screenings in federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). Methods: Between October 2021 and June 2022, we conducted a national web survey of clinicians (physicians and advanced practice providers) who performed cervical cancer screening in FQHCs in the United States during the post-acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, along with a sub-set of qualitative interviews via video conference, to examine perceived changes in cervical cancer screening practices during the pandemic. Results: A total of 148 clinicians completed surveys; a subset (n=13) completed qualitative interviews. Most (86%) reported reduced cervical cancer screening early in the pandemic, and 28% reported continued reduction in services at the time of survey completion (October 2021- July 2022). Nearly half (45%) reported staff shortages impacting their ability to screen or track patients. Compared to clinicians in Obstetrics/Gynecology/Women's health, those in family medicine and other specialties more often reported reduced screening compared to pre-pandemic. Most (92%) felt that screening using HPV self-sampling would be very or somewhat helpful to address screening backlogs. Qualitative interviews highlighted the impacts of staff shortages and strategies for improvement. Conclusions: Findings highlight that in late 2021 and early 2022, many clinicians in FQHCs reported reduced cervical cancer screening and of pandemic-related staffing shortages impacting screening and follow-up. If not addressed, reduced screenings among underserved populations could worsen cervical cancer disparities in the future.
