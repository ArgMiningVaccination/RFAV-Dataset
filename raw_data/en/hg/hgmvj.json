If patient has not had a SARS -CoV-2 molecular or antigen test, obtain test and repeat question #2a once resul ts are available . 3) Risk of Progression Screen (Form Qs: #7, demographics and REALD ) a. Does the patient have at least one of the conditions or factors met in # 7 of the Self -Screening Patient Intake Form which places an individual at high risk of progression to severe COVID -19? b. Does the patient identify as Black, African American, Latina/o/x, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Asian American , or Pacific Islander on the Self-Screening Patient Intake Form which places an individual at high risk of progression to severe COVID -19? NOTE: Other factors, such as race , ethnicity , disability or houselessness place individual patients at high risk for progression to severe COVID -19. Data indicates that: Patients of color or from tribal communities are most harmed by health inequities and the risk of hospitalization and death for these groups is greater than that of white patients. These patients may face higher risk than white patients, due to longstanding societal injustices including racism, discrimination, colonization, etc., which have and continue to negatively impact health outcomes. For this reason, people who identify as Black /African American, Latin o/a/x, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander are eligible for REGEN - COV under this protocol . Patients with the following disabilities might be at increased risk of becoming infected or having unrecognized illness or progression to severe disease.

INDICATIONS : 1. Treatment: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an EUA to permit the emergency use of the unapproved product REGEN -COV for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID -19 within 10 days of symptom* onset in adult and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV -2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID -19, including hospitalization or death. *Mild or moderate COVID -19 symptoms may include: fever or chills; cough; shortness of or difficulty breathing; fatigue; muscle or body aches; headache; new loss of taste or smell; sore throat; congestion or runny nose; nausea or vomiting; and/or diarrhea. Limitations of Authorized Use as Treatment : REGEN -COV is not authorized for use in patients: o who are hospitalized due to COVID -19, OR o who require oxygen therapy due to COVID -19, OR o who require an increase in baseline oxygen flow rate due to COVID -19 in those on chronic oxygen therapy due to underlying non -COVID -19 related co -morbidity. 2. Post -exposure Prophylaxis: The FDA also issued an EUA to permit the emergency use of the unapproved product REGEN -COV in adult and pediatric individuals (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) for post -exposure prophyl axis of COVID -19 in individuals who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID -19, including hospitalization or death, and are: a. not fully vaccinated* or who are not expected to mount an adequate immune response to complete SARS -CoV -2 vaccination (for example, individuals with immunocompromising conditions including those taking immunosuppressive medications**) AND i. Who have been exposed to an individual infected with SARS -CoV -2 consistent with close contact criteria per Centers for Dise ase Control and Prevention (CDC)*** OR ii. Who are at high risk of exposure to an individual infected with SARS -CoV -2 because of occurrence of SARS -CoV -2 infection in other individuals in the same institutional setting (e.g., nursing homes, prisons) * Individ uals are considered to be fully vaccinated 2 weeks after their final dose of a multi -dose series , or 2 weeks after a single -dose vaccine . **See this -vaccinated -people.html ***Close contact with an infected individual is defined as: being within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes or more, providing care a t home to someone who is sick, having direct physical contact with the person (e.g., hugging or kissing), sharing eating or drinking utensils, or being exposed to respiratory droplets from an infected person (e.g., sneezing or coughing).

Patients may not be vaccinated for COVID -19 until 90 days after treatment with REGEN - COV . REGEN -COV is not authorized for pre-exposure prophylaxi s for prevention of COVID -19. II. PATIENT ELIGIBILITY : An eligible patient must meet the criteria within one of the two authorized indications. For both indications, a patient must be at high risk for progression to severe COVID -19, including hospitalization or death. Patients at high risk include, but are not limited to, individuals with at least one of the following risk factors: Older age (age 65 years of age) Obesity or being overweight (BMI >25 kg/m2, or if age 12-17 years, have BMI 85th percentile for their age and gender based on CDC growth charts, https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/clinical_charts.htm ) Pregnancy Chronic kidney disease Diabetes Immunosuppressive disease or immunosuppressive treatment Cardiovascular disease (including congenital heart disease) or hypertension Chronic lung disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma [moderate-to -severe], interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension) Sickle cell disease Neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., cerebral palsy) or other conditions that confer medical complexity (e.g., genetic or metabolic syndromes and severe congenital anomalies) Have a medical -related technological dependence (e.g., tracheostomy, gastrostomy, or positive pressure ventilation (not related to COVID 19) Authorization of REGEN -COV under the EUA is not limited to the medical conditions or factors listed above . Other factors , such as race or ethnicity may also place individual patients at high risk for progression to severe COVID -19. For example, data show that patients of color or from tribal communities are most harmed by health inequities and the risk of hospitalization and death for these groups is greater t han that of white patients . These patients may face higher risk than white patients, due to longstanding societal injustices including racism, discrimination, colonization, etc ., which have and continue to negatively impact health outcomes. For this reason, people who identify as Black, African American, Latina/o/x, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Asian American or Pacific Islander are eligible for REGEN -COV under this protocol. If a patient requesting monoclonal antibody treatment does not fall into one of the categories specified above , pharmacists should refer the patient to a medical provider for risk -benefit consideration.

Approximately 13,500 subjects received intravenous infusions and 2,500 subjects received subcutaneous The safety of REGEN -COV (casiri -2067, a Phase 1/2/3 trial of ambulatory (non -hospitalized) subjects with COVID -19; COV -2069, a Phase 3 post -exposure prophylaxis trial for prevention of COVID -19; and COV -2093, a Phase 1 trial evaluati pharmacokinetics of REGEN -COV repeat dosing every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. COV -2067 : This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled clinical trial (NCT04425629) in subjects with mild to moderate COVID -19. In the phase 3 portion of the trial, subjects were treated with a single intravenous infusion of 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab (n=827), or 1,200 mg of casirivimab and 1,200 mg of imdevimab (n=1,849) ( unauthorized dose under EUA ), or 4,000 of casirivimab and 4,000 mg of imdevimab (n=1,012) ( unauthorized dose under EUA ), or placebo (n=1,843). At baseline, in all randomized subjects with at least one risk factor, the median age was 50 years (with 13% of subjects ages 65 years or older), 52% of the subjects were female, 84% were White, 36% were Hispanic or Latino, and only 5% were Black or African American. In subjects with available baseline symptom data, 15% had mild symptoms, 42% had moderate, 42% had severe symptoms, and 2% reported no symptoms a t baseline; the median duration of symptoms was 3 days. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with 1 COVID -19-related hospitalization or all- cause death through Day 29. The results for subjects treated with 600 mg of casirivumab and 600 mg o f imdevimab compared to placebo are outlined in Table 1 . Table 1.

In pooled phase 1/2/3 analysis, infusion -related reactions (adverse event assessed as causally related by the investigator) of grade 2 or higher severity have been observed in 10/4,206 (0.2%) of those who received REGEN -COV at the authorized dose or a higher dose. The infusion was permanently discontinued in 4 subjects who developed infusion -related reactions (urticaria, pruritus, flushing, Standardized Assessment and Treatment Care Pathway COVID Monoclonal Antibodies (REGEN- COV) Oregon Board of Pharmacy v. 09/2021 Page 15 of 16 of COVID mAb Assessment and Treatment Care Pathway pyrexia, shortness of breath, chest tightness, nausea, vomiting, rash) but each r eceived doses higher than what is authorized under EUA. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported in subjects receiving REGEN -COV . The events began within 1 hour of completion of the infusion, and in at least one case required treatment including epinephr ine. The events resolved. COV -2069: This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled clinical trial (NCT04452318) that assessed the efficacy and safety of REGEN -COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) for post -exposure prophylaxis of COVID -19 in household contacts of individuals infected with SARS -CoV -2. The trial enrolled subjects who were asymptomatic and who lived in the same household with a SARS -CoV -2 infected patient. Subjects who were SARS-CoV -2 negative (PCR negative and seronegative) at b aseline were enrolled and received a single dose of 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab subcutaneously (n=751) or placebo (n=752). Subjects who were SARS -CoV -2 positive at baseline were enrolled in Cohort B and received a single dose of 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab subcutaneously or placebo. Cohort A: At baseline, the median age was 44 years (with 9% of subjects ages 65 years or older), 54% of the subjects were female, 86% were White, 41% were Hispanic or Latino, and 9% were Blac k or African American. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects who developed PCR -confirmed COVID -19 through Day 29. The results for subjects treated with 600 mg of casirivumab and 600 mg of imdevimab compared to placebo are outlined in Table 2 . In a post -hoc analysis in a subgroup of subjects who met the criteria for high risk for progression to severe COVID -19, there was a 76% relative risk reduction in COVID -19 with REGEN -COV treatment versus placebo ratio 2.

Adverse events were reported in 265 subjects (20%) in the REGEN -COV group and 379 subjects (29%) in the placebo group. Injection site reactions (all grade 1 and 2) occurred in 55 subjects (4%) in the REGEN -COV group and 19 subjects (2%) in the placebo group. The most common signs and symptoms of injection site reactions which occur red in at least 1% of subjects in the REGEN -COV group were erythema and pruritus. Hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 2 subjects (0.2%) in the REGEN -COV group and all hypersensitivity reactions were grade 1 in severity. There were no cases of anaphyla xis. Cohort B: Standardized Assessment and Treatment Care Pathway COVID Monoclonal Antibodies (REGEN- COV) Oregon Board of Pharmacy v. 09/2021 Page 16 of 16 of COVID mAb Assessment and Treatment Care Pathway In a post -hoc analysis of the overall combined Cohort A and Cohort B (regardless of serology status at baseline), there was a 62% risk reduction in COVID -19 with REGEN -COV treatment versus placebo (10%); adjusted odds ratio 0.35; p<0.0001]. Adverse events were reported in 52 subjects (34%) in the REGEN -COV group and 75 subjects (48%) in the placebo group. Injection site reactions, all of which were grade 1 or 2, occurred in 6 subjects (4%) in the REGEN -COV group and 1 subject (1%) in the placebo group. The most common signs and symptoms of injection site reactions which occurred in at least 1% of subjects in the REGEN -COV group were ecchymosis and erythema. There were no cases of hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis. COV -2093: This is a randomized double-blind, placebo -controlled Phase 1 trial evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity of repeated doses of 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab administered subcutaneously in healt REGEN -COV (n=729) or placebo (n=240) administered every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. Adverse events were reported in 380 subjects (52%) in the REGEN -COV group and 111 subjects (46%) in the placebo group. Inject ion site reactions occurred in 12% and 4% of subjects following single dose administration in the REGEN -COV and placebo groups, respectively.

SARS -CoV -2 is the virus that causes COVID -19. This Fact Sheet contains information to help you understand the potential r isks and potential benef its of taking REGEN -COV. Receiving REGEN -COV may benefit certain people with COVID -19 and may help prevent certain people who have been exposed to someone who is infected with SARS -CoV -2 from getting SARS -CoV -2 infection, or may prevent certain people who are at high risk of exposure to someone who is infected with SARS -CoV -2 from getting SARS -CoV -2 infection. Read this Fact Sheet for information about REGEN- COV. Ta lk to your healthcare prov ider if you have ques tions. It is your choice to receive REGEN -COV or stop at any time . WHAT IS COVI D-19? COV ID-19 is caused alled a cor onav irus, SARS -CoV -2. People can get COV ID-19 through contact wi th another person w ho has t he virus. COV ID-19 illnes ses have ranged from very mild ( including some wi th no repor ted symptoms) to severe, including illness resu lting in death. W hile informat ion so far sugges ts that most COVID-19 illness i s mild, ser ious ill ness can happen and may cause some of your other med ical condi tions to become w orse. People of all ages wi th severe, long- lasting (chroni c) medical condi tions like heart d isease, lung di sease, a nd di abetes, f or examp le, and other conditions including obesity, seem to be at higher risk of being hosp italized for COV ID-19. Older age, with or without other conditions, also places people at higher risk of being hospitalized for COVID - 19. WHAT ARE THE SYMPT OMS OF COVI D-19? The sympt oms of COVID -19 include fever, cough, and shor tness of breath, which m ay appear 2 to 14 days a fter exposure. Serious illness including breathing problems can occur and may cause your other medical conditions to become worse. WHAT IS REGEN -COV (casirivimab and imdevimab)? REGEN -COV is an investigational medicine used in adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older who weigh at least 88 pounds (40 kg)) who are at high risk for severe COVID -19, including hospitalization or death for: treatment of mild to moderate symptoms of COVID -19 post-exposure prevention of COVID -19 in persons who are: o not fully vaccinated against COVID -19 (Individuals are considered to be fully vaccinated 2 weeks after their second vaccine dose in a 2 -dose series [such as the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines], or 2 weeks after a single- dose vaccine [such as Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccine]), or , o are not expected to build up enough of an immune response to the complete COVID- 19 vaccination (for example, someone with immunocompromising Page 2 of 5 conditions, including someone who is taking immunosuppressive medications), and have been exposed to someone who is infected with SARS -CoV -2. Close contact with someone who is infected with SARS -CoV -2 is defined as being within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes or more, providing care at home to someone who is sick, having direct physical contact with the person (hugging or kissing, for example), sharing eating or drinking utensils, or being exposed to respiratory droplets from an infected person (sneezing or coughing, for example). For additional details, go to https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019- ncov/if -you-are- sick/quarantine.html , or someone who is at high risk of being exposed to someone who is infected with SARS -CoV -2 because of occurrence of SARS -CoV -2 infection in other individuals in the same institutional setting (for example, as nursing home s, prisons ,). REGEN -COV is investigational because it is still being studied. There is limited information known about the safety and effectiveness of using REGEN -COV to treat people with COVID -19 or to prevent COVID -19 in people who are at high risk of being exposed to someone who is infected with SARS -CoV -2. REGEN -COV is not authorized for pre -exposure prophylaxis for prevention of COVID -19. The FDA has aut horized the emergency use of REGEN- COV for the treatment of COVID -19 and the post -exposure prevention of COVID -19 under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). For more information on EUA, see the \"What is an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)?\" section at the end of this Fact Sheet. WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE REGEN -COV? Do not take REGEN -COV if you have had a severe allergic reaction to REGEN -COV. WHAT SHOULD I TELL MY HEALTH CARE PROVIDER BEFORE I RECEIVE REGEN -COV? Tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: Have any allergies Have had a severe allergic reaction including anaphylaxis to REGEN -COV previously Have received a COVID -19 vaccine. Have any serious illnesses Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed Are taking any medications (prescription, over -the-counter, vitamins, and herbal products) HOW WILL I RECEIVE REGEN -COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) ? REGEN -COV consists of two investigational medicines, casirivimab and imdevimab, given together at the same time through a vein (intravenous or IV) or injected in the Page 3 of 5 tissue just under the skin (subcutaneous injections). Your healthcare provider will determine th e most appropriate way for you to be given REGEN -COV. Treatment: If you are receiving an intravenous infusion, the infusion will take 20 to 50 minutes or longer. Your healthcare provider will determine the duration of your infusion. o If your healthcare pr ovider determines that you are unable to receive REGEN - COV as an intravenous infusion which would lead to a delay in treatment, then as an alternative, REGEN -COV can be given in the form of subcutaneous injections. If you are receiving subcutaneous inject ions, your dose will be provided as multiple injections given in separate locations around the same time. Post-exposure prevention: If you are receiving subcutaneous injections, your dose will be provided as multiple injections given in separate locations around the same time. If you are receiving an intravenous infusion, the infusion will take 20 to 50 minutes or longer. o After the initial dose, if your healthcare provider determines that you need to receive additional doses of REGEN -COV for ongoing protection, the additional intravenous or subcutaneous doses would be administered monthly. WHAT ARE THE IMPORTANT POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS OF REGEN -COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) ? Possible side effects of REGEN -COV are: Allergic reactions. Allergic reactions can happen during and after infusion or injection of REGEN -COV. Tell your healthcare provider right away or seek immediate medical attention if you get any of the following signs and symptoms of allergic reactions: fe ver, chills, nausea, headache, shortness of breath, low or high blood pressure, rapid or slow heart rate, chest discomfort or pain, weakness, confusion, feeling tired, wheezing, swelling of your lips, face, or throat, rash including hives, itching, muscle aches, feeling faint, dizziness and sweating. These reactions may be severe or life threatening. Worsening symptoms after treatment: You may experience new or worsening symptoms after infusion or injection , including fever, difficulty breathing, rapid or slow heart rate, tiredness, weakness or confusion. If these symptoms occur, contact your healthcare provider or seek immediate medical attention as some of these symptoms have required hospitalization. It is unknown if these symptoms are related to treatment or are due to the progression of COVID -19. The side effects of getting any medicine by vein may include brief pain, bleeding, bruising of the skin, soreness, swelling, and possible infection at the infus ion site. The side effects of getting any medicine by subcutaneous injection may include pain, bruising of the skin, soreness, swelling, and possible infection at the injection site. These are not all the possible side effects of REGEN- COV. Not a lot of people have been given REGEN -COV. Serious and unexpected side effects may happen. REGEN -COV is still being studied so it is possible that all of the risks are not known at this time. It is possible that REGEN- COV could interfere with your body's own ability to fight off a future infection of SARS -CoV -2. Similarly, REGEN -COV may reduce your body's immune response to a vaccine for SARS -CoV -2. Specific studies have not been conducted to address these possible risks. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have any questions. Page 4 of 5 WHAT O THER TREATMENT CHOI CES ARE TH ERE? Like REGEN -COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) , FDA may allow for the emergency use of other medicines to treat people with COVID -19. Go to https://www.fda.gov/emergency - preparedness -and-response/mcm -legal -regulatory- and-policy- framework/emergency -use- authorization for information on the emergency use of other medicines that are not approved by FDA that are used to treat people with COVID -19. Your healthcare provider may talk with you about clinical trials you may be eligible for. It is your choice to be treated or not to be treated with REGEN -COV. Should you decide not to receive REGEN -COV or stop it at any time, it will not change your standard medical care. WHAT O THER PREVENTION CHOI CES ARE TH ERE? Vaccines to prevent COVID -19 are also available under Emergency Use Authorization. Use of REGEN -COV does not replace vaccination against COVID -19. REGEN -COV is not authorized for pre -exposure prophylaxis for prevention of COVID -19. WHAT IF I AM PREGNANT OR BREAST FEEDING? There is limited experience using REGEN -COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) in pregnant women or breastfeeding mothers. For a mother and unborn baby, the benefit of receiving REGEN -COV may be greater than the risk of using the product . If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, discuss your options and specific situation with your healthcare provider. HOW DO I REPORT SIDE EFFE CTS WITH REGEN -COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) ? Tell your healthcare prov ider right away if you have a ny side ef fect that bother s you or does not go away. Report side effects to FDA Med Watch at www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1 -800-FDA-1088 or call 1- 844-734-6643. HOW CAN I LEARN M ORE? Ask your health care p rovider . Visit www.REGENCOV.com Visit https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ Contact your local or state public health department . WHAT IS AN EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION (EUA)? The United States FDA has made REGEN -COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) available under an emergency access mechanism called an EUA. The EUA is supported by a Secretary of Health and Human Service (HHS) declaration that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID -19 pandemic. Page 5 of 5 REGEN -COV has not undergone the same type of review as an FDA- approved product. In issuing an EUA under the COVID -19 public health emergency, the FDA must determine, among other things, that based on the totality of scientific evidence available, it is reasonable to believe that the product may be effective for diagnosing, treating, or preventing COVID -19, or a serious or life -threatening disease or condition caused by COVID -19; that the known and potential benefits of the product, when used to diagnose, treat, or prevent such disease or condition, outweigh the known and potential risks of such product; and that there are no adequate, approved and available alternatives. All of these criteria must be met to allow for the medicine to be used in the treatment of COVID -19 or prevention of COVID -19 during the COVID -19 pandemic. The EUA for REGEN -COV is in effect for the duration of the COVID -19 declaration justifying emergency use of these products, unless terminated or revoked (after which the products may no longer be used).

REGIMEN: Truvada \u00ae (emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumurate 300 mg) one tablet by mouth daily for 30 days PLUS Isentress \u00ae (raltegravir 400 mg) one tablet by mouth twice daily for 30 days Notes: There may be other FDA -approved regimens available for treatment of PEP. Truvada\u00ae plus Isentress\u00ae is the only regimen permitted for pharmacist prescribing at this time. Although labeling is for 28 day supply, 30 days is recommended for prescribing due to the products being available only in 30 -day packaging and high cost of the medications whi ch could provide a barrier to availability and care. If able, 28 -day regimens are appropriate if the pharmacist/pharmacy is willing to dispense as such. Pregnancy is not a contraindication to receive PEP treatment as Truvada\u00ae and Isentress\u00ae are preferred medications during pregnancy. If the patient is pregnant, please report their demographics to the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry: http://www.apregistry.com If the patient is breastfeeding, the benefit of presc ribing PEP outweigh the risk of the infant acquiring HIV. Package inserts recommend against breastfeeding. \"Pumping and dumping\" may be considered. Consider consulting with an infectious disease provider, obstetrician, or pediatrician for further guidance. COUNSELING POINTS: Truvada\u00ae: o Take the tablet every day as prescribed with or without food. Taking it with food may decrease stomach upset. o Common side effects include nausea/vomiting, diarrhea for the first 1 -2 weeks. Isentress\u00ae: o Take the tablet twice daily as prescribed with or without food. Taking it with food might decrease any stomach upset. o If you take vitamins or supplements with calcium or magnesium, take the supplements 2 hours before or 6 hours after the Isentress\u00ae. Do not take on e of these medications without the other. Both medications must be taken together to be effective and to prevent possible resistance. You must follow up with appropriate provider for lab work. Discuss side -effects of \"start -up syndrome\" such as nausea, diarrhea, and/or headache which generally resolve within a few days to weeks of starting the medications. Discuss signs and symptoms of seroconversion such as flu -like symptoms (e.g. fatigue, fev er, sore throat, body aches, rash, swollen lymph nodes). *Oregon licensed pharmacists are mandatory reporters of child abuse, per ORS Chapter 419B .

Listed below are the medications and directions you have been prescribed, some key points to remember about these medications, and a list of next steps that will need to be done in order to confirm the PEP worked for you. Medications: You must start these within 72 hours of your exposure Truvada (emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil) 200 mg/300 mg - take 1 tablet by mouth daily for 30 days, AND Isentress (raltegravir) 400 mg - take 1 tablet by mouth twice daily for 30 days Key Points Take every dose. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. o If it is close to the time of your next dose, just take that dose. Do not double up on doses to make up for the missed dose. Do not stop taking either medication without first asking your doctor or pharmacist. Truvada and Isentress don't have side effects most of the time. The most common side effects (if they do happen) are stomach upset. Taking Truvada and Isentress with food can help with stomach upset. Over -the- counter nausea and diarrhea medications are okay to use wi th PEP if needed. Avoid over -the-counter pain medications like ibuprofen or naproxen while taking PEP. Follow -up and Next Steps 1. Contact your primary care provider to let them know you have been prescribed PEP because they will need to order lab tests and see you. The pharmacy cannot do these lab tests. 2. Our pharmacist will contact your doctor (or public health office if you do not have a primary doctor) to let them know what labs they need to order for you. 3. The tests we will be recommending to check at 6 weeks and at 3 months are listed below. The listed labs will involve a blood draw. Your provider may choose to do more tests as needed. \u0000 HIV antigen/antibody 4th generation \u0000 Hepatitis B surface antigen and surface antibody \u0000 Hepatitis C antibody \u0000 Treponema pallidum antibody \u0000 Comprehensive metabolic panel 4. If you think that you might still be at risk of HIV infection after you finish the 30- day PEP treatment, talk to your doctor about starting Pre -exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) after finishing PEP.

If a patient has one or more contraindications, the pharmacist must refer the patient to a specialist for consultation or management of PrEP . Medical history factor Notes and consi derations REFERRAL CONDITIONS 1. Positive HIV test Needs Referral: yes no A positive or indeterminate HIV test either indicates HIV infection, a false positive, or a result requiring specialist interpretation. Confirmatory testing is beyond the testing capacity of the communit y pharmacist and the patient should be referred for PrEP management. 2. Presence of Hepatitis B infection Needs Referral: yes no Truvada and Descovy are treatments for Hepatitis B. In patients with Hepatitis B who stop PrEP, this may cause a HepB disease flare. People with HepB infection must have their PrEP managed by a gastroenterologist or infectious disease specialist. 3. Presence of Hepatitis C exposure Needs Referral: yes no People with HepC exposure must be referr ed to primary care or other appropriate community health outreach organization (e.g. HIV Alliance, Cascade AIDS Project, Eastern Oregon Center fo r Independent Living). Pharmacist may proceed with prescribing PrEP. 4. Impaired kidney function (<30mL/min) Needs Referral: yes no Truvada is approved for patients with a CrCl >60mL/min. Consider Descovy in cis- gender men and male to female transgender women who have risk factors for kidney disease with a CrCl >30mL/min, but less than 60mL/min. Pharmacist prescribing of PrEP is contraindicated for patients who are under the care of a specialist for chroni c kidney disease. 5. Other medications Needs Referral: yes no Evaluate for comorbid medications that can be nephrotoxic or decrease bone mineral density. For cis -gender men and male to female transgender women who are on medications that could be nephrotoxic or could lower bone mineral density, consider Descovy over Truvada. CONSIDERATIONS 6. NSAID use Precaution - Counseled on limit ing use: yes no Tenofovir use in conjunction with NSAIDs may increase the risk of kidney damage. Concurrent use is not contraindicated, but patient should be counseled on limiting NSAID use. 7. Hepatitis B vaccinated If not, would the patient like to be vaccinated? yes no Vaccination for Hepatitis B is preferred, but lack of vaccination is not a contraindication for PrEP. Counsel on risk factors for Hepatitis B and recommend vaccination. If patient would like to be vaccinated, proceed according to OAR 855- 019- 0280 . 8. Pregnant or breastfeeding Pregnancy and breastfeeding are not contraindications for PrEP. Women at risk of HIV who are also pregnant are at higher risk of intimate partner violence. Truvada is preferred due to better data in these populations. 4. Are O ne or More Referral Condition(s) Present? yes no If yes, HIV PrEP is recommended but pharmacist s are not authorized to prescribe in accordance with this RPH protocol . Refer the patient for further evaluation and management of PrEP by the patient's healthcare provider or appropriate specialist. If no, HIV PrEP is recommended and pharmacist s are authori zed to prescribe and dispense PrEP in accordance with this RPH protocol. Proceed to next sections : Regimen Selection and P rescri ption .

If patient has low bone mineral density or renal function that would preclude Truvada u se, but has risk factors for HIV , refer the patient to a specialist for PrEP management. Truvada NSAID use If patient is male or a male to female transgender woman, cons ider Descovy Descovy Patient has some kidney impairment (CrCl <60mL/min ) but is not under care of nephrologist. If patient is male or male to female transgender woman, consider Descovy Descovy Patient ha s decreased bone mineral density or on medications that affect bone mineral density.

Listed below are some key points to know about P rEP. Provider pearls for HIV P rEP: Truvada is not recommended for CrCl less than 6 0 mL/min. Please contact the pharmacy if this applies to your patient and/or there is a decline in renal function. Descovy may be a better option. Truvada and Descovy are both safe in pregnancy. If your patient is pregnant or becomes pregnant, they may continue PrEP. NSAIDs should be avoided while patients are taking HIV P rEP to avoid drug- drug interactions with Truvada. Truvada is a first line option for Hepatitis B treatment. This is not a contraindication to P rEP use, but we recommended you refer Hepatitis B positive patients to an infectious disease or gastroenterology specialist. A positive STI test is not a contraindication for PrEP. Pharmacy monitoring of HIV PrEP: The pharmacy prescribing and dispensing PrEP conducts and/or reviews results of HIV testing, STI testing, and baseline testing as p art of their patient assessment. Patients who test reactive or indeterminate for HIV, gonorrhea/chlamydia, syphilis, or Hepatitis B will be referred to your office for evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment . Your office may take over management of this pati ent's HIV PrEP from the pharmacy at any time.

Fiscal Impact: 1.2021 HB 2074 increases the PDMP fee from $25 to $35 annually resulting in a $20 increase in fees paid by a pharmacist at the time of biennial licensure renewal. Increasing the fee will result in increased revenue by the agency of approximately $172,200 ($10 per year or $20 x 8600 RPH renewals) . 90% of the revenue is passed through to the PDMP program and 10% is retained by the agency for administrative costs , resulting in an agency revenue increase of $17,200. 2.T here are 52 Supervising Physician Dispensing Outlets (SPDO) and 4 9 Dispensing Practitioner Dispensing Outlets (DPDO) currently active .

The discontinued SPDOs may now mee t the requ irements for regist ration as a \"DPDO\". The current SPDO registration fee is $175 annually and the current DPDO registration fee is $100 annually. There are 6 locations that hold both registrations. 3.T he use of NABP's eProfile and eGov processes have reduced many of the manual processes and created licensing efficiencies . a.Re-e xamination fees for NAPLEX .

No anticipated fiscal. b.S core Transfer is applicable to new graduates and has similar workload to licens ure via exam (NAPLEX), so the fee should be equivalent to the current NAPLEX fee . The Board receives approximately 125 Score Transfer applications in a biennium. Reducing this fee from $250 to $50 will result in a biennial revenue reduction of $25,000 . c. Reciprocity (Licensure Transfer) is applicable to applicants who are licensed as a pharmacist in another state and meet the requirements listed in ORS 689.265 and OAR 855 -019-0130.

B OAR 855 -025-0012 require s an applicant to take and pass a n ational pharmacy technician certification exam and then apply for licensure as a COPT . Pharmacy Technician Certification Board recognized education/training program , or; complet e at least 500 work hours and attest to fulfilling specified knowledge requirements National Healthcare Association (NHA) req uires : completion of a training program (employer- based or offered by national pharmacy association ) that is recognized by the Board of Pharmacy , or; complet ion of at least 1200 hours of supervised pharmacy related work experience in the health field within any 1 year in the last 3 years. W ith the new PTCB and existing NHA requirements: A PT who has n ot recently completed the required training requirements is no t el igible to take the exam An individual who had a technician license that has been lapsed in the last 5 years : oIs not eligible for a COPT license oIs not eligible to complete a training progra m as a PT or work in a pharmacy to obtain the required hours B ecause OAR 855 -025-0012 require s a national certification (active or inactive) to remain eligible for licensure , our current rules present is a barrier to licensure and employment as a Certifie d Oregon Pharmacy Technician in Oregon to those who have never held a national certification . OA R 855 -025-0060(2) Reinstatement of a C OPT License - states: A Certified Oregon Pharmacy Technician whose license has been lapsed greater than five years must : (a) Re-t ake and pass a national pharmacy technician certification examination offered by: (A)T he Pharmacy Technician Certification Board (PTCB); or (B)N ational Healthcareer Association (NHA). oA fter 5 years, a C OPT with a lapsed license is required to have an active nation al c ertification, but this is not required for initial licensure. This represents a higher bar for reinstatement than for initial licensure. (See above - OAR 855 -025-0012 ) OAR 855 -025-0005 (1) -To qualify for licensure as a Pharmacy Technician or Certified Oregon Pharmacy Technician, an applicant must demonstrate that the applicant is at least 18 years of age and has obtained a high school diploma or GED. T his means: An individual who was home schooled, did not graduate from high school, or have a G ED, but obtained a 2 or 4 -year college or university degree is not eligible fo r lic ensure oThere have been several occasions where an applicant that holds a 2 or 4 -year degree has had to enroll and obtain a GED to apply for a license o There is no waiver to the rulesOCTOBER 2021/B855-025-0001 states that the purpose of the Pharmacy Technician (PT) license is to provide an opportunity for an individual to obtain competency in the role as a Pharm acy Technician. This license will allow an individual time to take and pass a national pharmacy technician certification examination, which is required to be eligible for licensure as a Certified Oregon Pharmacy Technician (C OPT). These rules facilitate th e initial licensure of a nationally certified Pharmacy Technician seeking licensure in Oregon. Extensions have not been granted for the processing time of a n application. Once the qualifications for a C OPT license are met and an application has been rece ived, extensions are not considered. o Messaging is sent out with the initial license and again in February of the license expiration year with a reminder to take the exam and apply for licensure in advance of the license expiration dates. Many individuals do not apply for licensure until expiration month of their PT license . In 2021, there were 27 applications that were submitted on 6/13 or later that were not able to be issued prior to the expiration of the PT license . This was due to a delay in processing because of a backlog of fingerprinting processing by the Oregon State Police. Many individuals were not able to work effective 7/1 due to the expiration of their PT license . This affected both the applicants and the employers. It was rep orted by a chain pharmacy representative that this created \"undue stress on some of the pharmacies, who have already experienced staffing shortages and burnout from the COVID -19 pandemic .\" Related ORS: 689.499 Pharmacy technician specialized education program; rules.

(c) Upon receipt of evidence satisfactory to the board that a pharmacy technician has satisfactorily completed a specialized education program approved by the board , the board shall note the specialized education on the license of the pharmacy technician. (2) The board may establish standards for renewal or revocation of a notation of specialized education under this section. (3) As used in this section, \" specialized education program \" means: (a) A program providing education for persons desi ring licensure as pharmacy technicians that is approved by the board and offered by an accredited college or university that grants a two-year degree upon successful completion of the program; or (b) A structured program approved by the board and des igned to educate pharmacy technicians in one or more specific issues of patient health and safety that is offered by: (A) An organization recognized by the board as representing pharmacists or pharmacy technicians; (B) An employer recognized by the board as representing pharmacists or pharmacy technicians; or (C) A trade association recognized by the board as representing pharmacies . [2005 c.313 \u00a716] The Board has no authority to renew or revoke a national certification o National certification is not required to be maintained to hold a C OPT license o When certification lapses, a COPT is no longer \"certified\" (the board does not issue \"certification\") National certification is not a \"specialized education program\" Duties are not different for a PT vs C OPT A Pharmacy Technician r ules require revision to remove barriers to licensure and clarify language .

OCTOBER 2021/D 1 PharmCon Contraceptive Care Specialty Pharmacist CE Certificate Program Oregon Board of Pharmacy Content Reviewer Results 10-14-2021 Content Reviewers Lincoln Alexander, Pharm.D., RPH Dr. Alison This program provides a thorough review of women's reproductive health. Q1: This program provides a thorough review of women's reproductive health. I will defer the clinical assessment of this program to the experts in medicine; from what I reviewed, this course is adequate. This program covers women's reproductive health well through Module 1.3 410/8/2021 3 Q2: This program provides a robust therapeutics and pharmacologic review. Q2: This program provides a robust therapeutics and pharmacologic review. I will defer the clinical assessment of this program to the experts in medicine/pharmacy; from what I reviewed, this course is adequate. Again this part is comprehensive. I liked the drug review, it was a good refresher. I thought the prior OSU program did a bit better of a job with pharmacology review. Not clear throughout what methods are combined hormonal methods (pills, patch, ring). Concept of progestin 'generations' is outdated and not part of evidence-based prescribing Does not include estetrol in list of synthetic estrogens (granted this pill is new this year). Through out COCs are listed as EC - this is a historical method and no longer recommended Contraindications to many methods and obesity are listed; this also is not consistent with current guidance. 5 610/8/2021 4 Q2: This program provides a robust therapeutics and pharmacologic review. Precautions exist but it is not contraindicated due to efficacy. Not clear throughout that the drosperinone only pill - is cyclic and not continuous Module 6 doesn't include use of referral for clients that want LARC and 'bridging' methods are not discussed if a patient does need to be referred Those with risk factors for DVT still have the use of a CHC listed which is also not consistent with recommendations. Not clear what 'tests/exams' are recommended/needed - many are listed but these again are not consistent with CDC recommendations. Q3: This program comprehensively teaches the \"art\" of patient assessment, evaluation and contraceptive product selection. 7 810/8/2021 5 Q3: This program comprehensively teaches the \"art\" of patient assessment, evaluation and contraceptive product selection. I found the example patient case not pertinent to pharmacist prescribing. I don't understand why the ONE example was a patient that was referred to a physician for a copper IUD. They also did not cover using the US MEC/OR MEC at all. I think pharmacists in Oregon should see the US MEC/OR MEC and understand how to use that document to select appropriate contraception for a patient. Additionally, in my professional opinion this training was misleading to the current guidance around the use of combined hormonal contraception options during breastfeeding and would lead a pharmacist to prescribe CHC for a patient breastfeeding without adequately addressing the risks/benefits. Also, the description of start methods for CHCs and the use of backup methods for 7 days is incorrect in Module 3. Also, they incorrectly use the term \"effectiveness rates\" as and example the speaker states that the \"effectiveness rate\" for IUDs is <1%. Lastly, they describe for IUDs that the strings should be \"visible.\" Strings are not \"visible\" to the patient or anyone that is not looking intravaginally with a speculum. Q3: This program comprehensively teaches the \"art\" of patient assessment, evaluation and contraceptive product selection. The program gave a good overview of the assessment, evaluation and product selection process. The examples of patient/pharmacist interaction demonstrate some degree of interactivity. Modules on contraindications and evaluation contained the appropriate content but were chaotically organized. I would find it hard if I knew nothing about how to evaluate a patient to figure out how to take the knowledge and apply it to an encounter. I really like Oregon's training program with the checklist which is based on the CDC MEC and SPR. This training program did not reference either of those two main evidence based guidelines. Also there is no information on shared decision making and working with the patient around their choice. Its about what does the provider 'recommend'. I think this is extremely important in this era of social/reproductive justice and concerns regarding coercion.9 1010/8/2021 6 Q4: This program prepares the pharmacist to comply with all related Oregon laws and rules. Q4: This program prepares the pharmacist to comply with all related Oregon laws and rules. In the content I reviewed, I recall a mention of \"Oregon's questions\" used to effectively rule out pregnancy. The reference for the questions should be the CDC. Unfortunately, this program completely misses the mark of walking a pharmacist through the use of the MEC/Questionnaire/Algorithms developed for this prescribing authority. I recommend the program create a separate module for state-specific elements; without this component, I am unsure how the board can approve this course. I would reiterated my concerns that this program does not cover the use of the US/OR MEC. Yes, but to be most compliant need to review Oregon-specific protocol on website11 1210/8/2021 7 Q5: This program is interactive and incorporates effective fundamentals of adult learning. Q5: This program is interactive and incorporates effective fundamentals of adult learning. This course is easy to follow, content is friendly and somewhat interactive. I think that this course should be more interactive. The quizzes are sufficient but would like to see more interaction in the presentations. I think this program is missing some key components in order for someone to operationalize and safely prescribe13 1410/8/2021 8 Q6: Do you have any other comments, questions or concerns? Recommend a thorough clinical analysis of the program's \"knowledge test\" at the end of the course. It must be designed to provide reasonable certainty that unless a student really concentrates throughout the entire course, he/she will not be able to pass the test. A pharmacist is a postgraduate doctoral student and must be capable of passing a test designed to truly make him/her an eligible candidate for this prescribing privilege. Be sure the test isn't \"too easy\". Thank you for the opportunity to provide input. Really difficult to listen to her mispronounce \"Oregon\" throughout Module 5 and 6. Module 6 is too long and not particularly relevant to a pharmacist being able to safely prescribe hormonal contraceptives in Oregon. Lastly, they incorrectly say that pharmacists are not able to bill Medicaid for contraceptive services. 15Pharmacy, Board of Annual Performance Progress Report Reporting Year 2021 Published: 10/1/2021 12:46:26 PMOCTOBER 2021/EKPM # Approved Key Performance Measures (KPMs) 1 Percent of inspected pharmacies that are in compliance annually. - 2 Percentage of individual and facility licenses that are issued within 30 days. - 3 Percent of pharmacies inspected every two years. - 4 Average number of days to complete an investigation from complaint to board presentation. - 5 CUSTOMER SERVICE - Percent of Customers Rating Their Satisfaction With the Agency's Customer Service as \"Good\" or \"Excellent\" : Overall Customer Service, Timeliness, Accuracy, Helpfulness, Expertise, and Availability of Information. 6 Board Best Practices - Percent of total best practices met by the Board.

Of the 74 completed inspections, 9 passed inspection, 57 passed with notes for improvement, 4 received deficiency notifications and 4 notifications of non compliance were issued; note all notifications are reviewed by the Board to determine if disciplinary action is warranted. 23 additional non-pharmacy inspections were also completed, including 8 manufacturers that produced hand sanitizer to support the COVID-19 public health emergency. Factors Affecting Results COVID-19 has impacted the agency's ability to conduct on-site inspections due to mandatory travel restrictions in the interest of public safety and health. Virtual inspections were implemented late spring 2021. Compliance staff' focus was on responding to COVID-19 questions and the many rule or guidance changes that impacted licensees/registrants throughout the year and continues in 2021. KPM #3 relates to this measure and was changed to reflect the percent of pharmacies inspected every two years rather than annually effective 7/1/2021. KPM #1 and #3 relate to one another, as one is dependent on the number of inspections and the other relates to compliance upon inspection. actualtargetKPM #2 Percentage of individual and facility licenses that are issued within 30 days. - Data Collection Period: Jan 01 - Dec 31 * Upward Trend = positive result Report Year 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Percentage of individual and facility licenses that are issued within 30 days. Actual 69% Target How Are We Doing This measure is new this biennium effective 7/1/2021. It will capture the changes in volume and workflow timeframes throughout the whole licensing process, from receipt of application through investigation, including Board member deliberation and approval, when required. In calendar year 2020, the percentage of licenses that were issued within 30 days was 69%. There were a total of 2619 licenses issued in 2020. The average number of days to issue a license was 48 days for facilities and 38 days for individuals. Factors Affecting Results The COVID-19 public health emergency prompted many changes to the way the Board does business. There were vacancies in both the Licensing and Compliance departments which was a strain on agency resources. Recruiting and onboarding of new employees was challenging during times of social distancing and limited staff in the office. Additionally, the transition from in person processing of applications to remote processing caused delays. New workflows needed to be developed. Daily mail and application review timeframes were extended due to limited staffing physically in the office. The implementation and issuance of temporary pharmacy licenses and manufacturer licenses for the production and distribution of hand sanitizer, and the licensing of drug distribution agents for the distribution of vaccines also affected the normal processing times of facility applications as these received priority processing. Applications that required Compliance Department and Board review were also impacted by the COVID-19 public health emergency. Much of the focus of the Compliance staff in 2020 was answering questions and following up with individuals to ensure the health, safety and welfare of patients, as well as pharmacy staff during the public health emergency. This delayed the review and approval of applications when required. Additionally, the Compliance staff is seeing that case complexity is changing, which causes increased time for investigations and Board review, which has contributed to actual targetthe increase in days to issuance or denial depending on the Board's decision.KPM #3 Percent of pharmacies inspected every two years. - Data Collection Period: Feb 01 - Jan 31 * Upward Trend = positive result Report Year 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Percent of pharmacies inspected every 2 years.

This number is inclusive of all cases, which include those initiated from inspection results, licensee and registrant application cases, drug diversion and theft cases, impairment cases, unprofessional conduct cases and all consumer complaints. Cases are triaged to ensure that the public's safety is maintained which may cause delays in processing of other types of cases. On average, cases are reported and presented to the Board within 141 days. This is an increase of 39 days from 2019. Factors Affecting Results Onboard training of new staff, continuous quality process improvements, new regulations to enforce, resources prioritized to COVID-19 responses, and patient safety assessment case triaging all contributed to the 2020 results for this measure. actualtargetKPM #5 CUSTOMER SERVICE - Percent of Customers Rating Their Satisfaction With the Agency's Customer Service as \"Good\" or \"Excellent\" : Overall Customer Service, Timeliness, Accuracy, Helpfulness, Expertise, and Availability of Information.

The percentage results provided, represent the respondents who responded with a rating of either Excellent or Good. Those that responded \"Don't Know\" or \"N/A\" were not factored into these ratings. Factors Affecting Results The 2020 COVID-19 public health emergency had an impact on agency resources that affected the timely dissemination of the customer service survey distribution. The Board sent out only two emails, in June 2020 and in January of 2021 rather than monthly. The Board's staff worked to address emergency issues and policies to ensure public safety. The Board's staff focused on implementing new online application processes to try to create efficiencies in the licensing process. In April of 2020, the Board rolled out a new online application process for all individuals, as well as online renewals for several new categories.KPM #6 Board Best Practices - Percent of total best practices met by the Board. Data Collection Period: Jan 01 - Dec 31 * Upward Trend = positive result Report Year 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Is the Board following Are We Doing The Board regularly works to follow best practices. The Executive Director provides weekly communication to the Board and meets with the President and Vice President as needed. Factors Affecting Results This year, seven out of nine members participated in providing feedback for this measure, two positions are vacant. There was a dissenting response on one question by one member making it impossible to achieve the 100% target. The opportunity to regularly orient the Board to best practices and answer questions is very useful. The Board has been able to meet the target most years since the measure was implemented in 2007. actualtargetSBAR: Schnebly, Eric (RPH -0007834): Approval Request - Bay Area Hospital SSituation: Approval Request - PIC of multiple pharmacy drug outlets.
