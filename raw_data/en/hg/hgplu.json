RECIPES From The Desk of the FCS/Nutrition Educator These are confounding and stressful times for all of us. The COVID 19 has impacted the World. We are all feeling uncertain about what could happen in the coming weeks, as we hope to slow the spread of this pandemic. feelings of fear, doubt, anxiety and uncertainty are com- pletely normal during times like this. It has altered our lives and changed our social func- tioning . This is the time for everyone to stay strong, positive, pull together and do our part by taking the necessary precautious and focus- ing on preventive measures to ensure our health, safety and long -term wellbeing. If you need support coping with this event, infor- mation and help available. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a webpage with information on deal- ing with fear, anxiety, and stress brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. A section of this CDC page is specifically geared toward those of us with children, as they can be particularly sensitive to uncertainty. It is important to real- ize that social distancing does not have to mean social isolation , especially with modern technologies available to many of us. Con- necting with our friends and loved ones, whether by high tech means or through a sim- ple text, phone calls, and emails can help us maintain ties during stressful days ahead . Working together and staying connected will give us strength to weather this difficult process. We will con- tinue to provide nutri- tion, health and well- ness information to Harford citizens and Mary- lander on the UME website, through emails, PDF's and other online formats.

P A G E 2 Community Health Resilience Community Health Resilience (CHR) is the ability of a community to use its assets to strengthen public health and healthcare systems and to improve the community 's physical, behavioral, and social health to withstand, adapt to, and recover from ad- versity. Why is community resilience important? Communities are increasingly complex, and so are the challenges they face. Human - caused and natural disasters are more fre- quent and costly. Factors like climate change, globalization, and increased urban- ization can bring disaster related risks to greater numbers of people. The new pan- demic has shown how it impact communi- ties locally, nationally and globally. Addressing these challenges calls for an approach that combines what we know about preparing for hardship with what we know about actions that strengthen com- munities every day. day. Community resilience focuses on enhanc- ing the day -to-day health and wellbeing of communities to reduce the negative impacts of disasters and challenges we cant control. How are community resilience and disas- ter preparedness related? Developing community resilience benefits ng community resilience benefits disaster planners and community members alike. Community resilience expands the traditional preparedness approach by en- couraging actions that build preparedness while also promoting strong community systems and addressing the many factors that contribute to health. Key preparedness activities \u2014such as conti- nuity of operations plans for organizations, reunification plans for families, and compil- ing disaster kits and resources \u2014continue to be essential, recommended steps to take. A resilience approach adds features like building social connectedness and im- proving everyday nutrition health, well- ness , and community systems. How does health and wellness fit in- to community resilience? Community resilience is the sustained abil- ity of communities to withstand, adapt to, and recover from adversity. Health \u2014 meaning physical, behavioral, social, and environmental health and wellbeing \u2014is a big part of overall resilience. In many ways, health is a key foundation of resilience because almost everything we do to prepare for disaster and protect in- frastructure is ultimately in the interest of preserving human health and welfare. Lets all do our part by pulling together to sup- port Harford families, communities, and local businesses and organization move toward normalcy in the coming weeks and months.

Between people who are in close con- tact with one another (within about 6 feet). Through respiratory droplets pro- duced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Wash your hands often Wash your hands often with soap and wa- ter for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily availa- ble, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol . Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact Avoid close contact with people who are sick Put distance between yourself and other people if COVID -19 is spreading in your community. This is especially im- portant for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick . Clean and disinfect surfaces Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, door- knobs, light switches, countertops, han- dles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks. If surfaces are dirty, clean them: Use de- tergent or soap and water prior to disin- fection. To disinfect: Most common EPA -registered household disinfectants will work. Use disinfectants appropriate for the surface. Options include: Diluting your household bleach. To make a bleach solution, mix: 5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) bleach per gallon of water OR 4 tea- spoons bleach per quart of water. Follow manufacturer 's instructions for application and proper ventilation. Check to ensure the product is not past its expira- tion date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Unexpired household bleach will be effec- tive against coronaviruses when properly diluted. Source: cdc.gov Stay Home & Stay Healthy .

This tip sheet pro- vides information about social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. The government has the right to enforce federal and state laws related to public health if people within the country get sick with highly contagious diseases that have the potential to develop into outbreaks or pandemics. This tip sheet describes feelings and thoughts you may have during and after social distancing, quarantine, and isola- tion. It also suggests ways to care for your behavioral health during these experienc- es and provides resources for more help. Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel: Anxiety, worry, or fear related to: Your own health status The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you The experience of monitoring your- self, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease Time taken off from work and the po- tential loss of income and job security The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items What Is Social Distancing? Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious dis- ease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and reli- gious services may be can- celled. What Is Quarantine? Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been ex- posed to a contagious dis- ease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease. What Is Isolation? Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious. Emotional Wellness Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine and Isolation The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID -19) may be stressful for people. Fear and anxiety about a disease can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions in adults and children. If you or your family members are feeling overwhelmed, try the following: 1. Take breaks from the news, including social media. Hearing about the pan- demic repeatedly can be upsetting. 2. Take care of your body. Take deep breaths, stretch, or meditate. Try to eat healthy, well -balanced meals, exer- cise regularly, get plenty of sleep, and avoid alcohol and drugs. 3. Make time to unwind. Try to do some activities you enjoy. Call your healthcare provider if stress gets in the way of your daily activities for several days in a row. If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others call 911 or the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 's (SAMHSA 's) Disaster Distress Helpline: 1 - 800-985-5990 or text TalkWithUs to 66746.

Handwashing can become a life- long healthy habit if you start teaching it at an early age. Teach kids the five easy steps for handwashing \u2014wet, lather, scrub, rinse and dry \u2014and the key times to wash hands, such as after using the bathroom or before eating. You can find ways to make it fun, like making up your own handwashing song or turning it into a game. Give frequent reminders. Building hand- washing skills takes time. At first, your child will need regular reminders of how and when to wash hands. It is especially important to remind children to wash their hands after using the bathroom, before eating, after touching pets, after playing outside, and after coughing, sneezing, or blowing their nose. But once handwashing becomes a habit and a reg- ular part of your child's day, they will practice it throughout their lives. Lead by example by washing your hands . Young children learn by imitating the be- haviors of adults in their lives. When you make handwashing part of your routine, you're setting an example for your chil- dren to follow. Source: cdc.gov Handwashing is one of the most important things you can do to prevent food poisoning when you are preparing food for yourself or loved ones. Washing your hands frequently with soap and water is an easy way to prevent germs from spreading around your kitchen and to other foods. Wash- ing hands is important even if you're wearing gloves . Be sure to wash your hands before and after using gloves to prevent the spread of germs. You can contaminate gloves with germs from your hands when you put on gloves. Contami- nated gloves can spread germs to your hands when you remove the gloves. Don 't let germs ruin your food plans. Make handwashing a healthy habit while preparing food for yourself and your loved ones! HELP YOUR CHILD DEVE LOP HANDWASHING SKILLS Handwashing can prevent 1 in 3 diarrhea -related sicknesses and 1 in 5 respiratory infections, such as a cold or the flu. Handwashing is an easy, cheap, and effective way to prevent the spread of germs and keep kids and adults healthy. When your family is healthy, you don 't have to worry about missing school, work, or other activities. P A G E 12 The CDC has identified older adults and people who have severe chronic medical condi- tions like heart, lung, or kidney disease at higher risk for more serious COVID - 19. According to the CDC , early data suggest older people are twice as likely to have seri- ous COVID -19. This is likely because as people age, their immune systems change, making it harder for their body to fight off diseases and infection, and because many older adults are also more likely to have underlying health conditions that make it harder to cope with and recover from. Age increases the risk that the respiratory system or lungs will shut down when an older person has COVID -19 disease. The CDC has emphasized that the best way to prevent illness is to avoid exposure . That 's why the CDC is recommending that people at higher risk take the following actions: Stock up on supplies. Take everyday precautions to keep space between yourself and others. When you go out in public, keep away from others who are sick, limit close contact, and wash your hands often. Avoid crowds as much as possible. Avoid cruise travel and non -essential air travel. During a COVID -19 outbreak in your community, stay home as much as pos- sible to further reduce your risk of being exposed. Anthony S. Faucet, M.D. , Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Dis- eases, said that people with serious chronic conditions, especially the elderly, should think twice about traveling or going to crowded places. He advised that these individuals take the simple steps of \"not putting yourself in a situation \u2014whatever that might be \u2014 that might increase the risk given your situation. \" Source: https://www.ncoa.org/blog/coronavirus -what -older -adults -need -to-know/ Senior Wellness P A G E 13 People At Higher Risk For Severe Illness COVID -19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. Based on currently available information and clinical exper- tise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical con- ditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID -19. Based upon available information to date, those at high -risk for severe illness from COVID -19 include: People aged 65 years and older People who live in a nursing home or long -term care facility Other high -risk conditions could include: People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma People who have serious heart condi- tions People who are immunocompro- mised including cancer treatment People of any age with severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] >40) or certain underlying medical conditions, particular- ly if not well controlled, such as those with diabetes, renal failure, or liver dis- ease might also be at risk. People who are pregnant should be monitored since they are known to be at risk with severe viral illness, however, to date data on COVID - 19 has not shown increased risk. Many conditions can cause a person to be immunocompromised, including cancer treatment, smoking, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficien- cies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and oth- er immune weakening medications. Source cdc .gov Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID -19. Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying med- ical condition. People with certain disabilities might experience higher rates of chronic health condi- tions that put them at higher risk of serious illness and poorer outcomes from COVID - 19. Adults with disabilities are three times more likely to have heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer than adults without disabilities. You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.

The COVID -19 virus has not been detected in drinking water. Conventional wa- ter treatment methods that use filtration and disinfection, such as those in most municipal drinking water systems, should remove or in- activate the virus that causes COVID -19. How to determine Water Needs -Store at least one gallon of water per person per day for three days, for drinking and sanitation. A nor- mally active person needs about three quar- ters of a gallon of fluid daily, from water and other beverages. However, individual needs vary, depending on age, health, physical condi- tion, activity, diet and climate. Take the fol- lowing into account: Children, nursing mothers and sick people may need more water. A medical emergency might require addi- tional water. If you live in a warm weather climate more water may be necessary. In very hot temperatures, water needs can double. Water Tips: Never ration drinking water unless or- dered to do so by authorities. Drink the amount you need today and try to find more for tomorrow. Minimize the amount of water your body needs by reducing activity and staying cool. Drink water that you know is not con- taminated first. If necessary, suspicious water, such as cloudy water from regular faucets or water from streams or ponds, can be used after it has been treated. If water treatment is not possible, put off drinking suspicious water as long as possi- ble, but do not become dehydrated. Do not drink carbonated or caffeinated beverages instead of drinking wa- ter. Caffeinated drinks and alcohol dehy- drate the body, which increases the need for drinking water.

It also works in removing toxins from the body, so drinking more of it could help prevent toxins from building up and having a negative impact on your immune sys- tem. Getting enough water every day is important for your health. Healthy people meet their fluid needs by drinking when thirsty and drinking with meals. Most of your fluid needs are met through the water and beverages you drink. However, you can get some fluids through the foods that you eat. For example, soups and foods with high water con- tent such as celery, tomatoes, herbal teas, string beans, or melons can contribute to fluid intake. Water helps your body: Keep your temperature normal Lubricate and cushion joints Protect your spinal cord and other sensitive tissues Get rid of wastes through urination, perspiration, and bowel movements Your body needs more water when you are: In hot climates More physically active Running a fever Having diarrhea or vomiting If you think you are not getting enough water, these tips may help: Carry a water bottle for easy access when you are at work of running errands. Freeze some freezer safe water bottles. Take one with you for ice -cold water all day long. Store water in glass or stainless steel container when possible for better quality . Choose water instead of sugar -sweetened beverages. This can also help with weight management. Substituting water for one 20 -ounce sugar sweetened soda will save you about 240 calories.

P A G E 18 Prevention Starts with Good Nutrition Good nutrition is essential to a strong immune system, which may offer pro- tection from seasonal illness and other health problems. No one food or sup- plement can prevent illness but you may help support your immune system by including these nutrients in your overall eating plan on a regular basis. Protein plays a role in the body's im- mune system, especially for healing and recovery. Eat a variety of protein foods including seafood, lean meat, poultry, eggs, beans and peas, soy products and unsalted nuts and seeds. Vitamin A helps regulate the immune system and protect against infections by keeping skin and tissues in the mouth, stomach, intestines and respiratory sys- tem healthy. Get this vitamin from foods such as sweet potatoes, carrots, broccoli, spinach, red bell peppers, apri- cots, eggs or foods labeled \"vitamin A fortified,\" such as milk or some cereals. Vitamin C supports the immune system by stimulating the formation of antibod- ies. Include more sources of this healthy vitamin by choosing citrus fruits such as oranges, grapefruit and tangerines, or red bell pepper, papaya, strawberries, tomato juice or foods fortified with vita- min C, such as some cereals. Vitamin E works as an antioxidant and may support immune function. Include vitamin E in your diet with fortified cere- als, sunflower seeds, almonds, vegeta- ble oils (such as sunflower or safflower oil), hazelnuts and peanut butter Zinc helps the immune system work properly and may help wounds heal. Zinc can be found in lean meat, poultry, seafood, milk, whole grain products, beans, seeds and nuts. Other nutrients , including vitamin B6, B12, copper, folate, selenium and iron also may support immune response and play a role in a healthful eating style. Obtaining these nutrients from foods is preferred, so be sure to speak with your health care provider or a registered die- titian nutritionist before taking any sup- plements. Source: Eatright.org P A G E 19 Although you may not be able to fully pre- vent an illness this season, a healthy im- mune system is one way to give your body extra protection. Focusing on nutrient -rich foods and healthy lifestyle behaviors can help you and your family stay a step ahead. I M M U N E -S U P P O R T I N G N U T R I - E N T S The following nutrients play a role in the immune system and can be found in a va- riety of foods: Beta Carotene is found in plant foods, such as sweet potatoes, spinach, car- rots, mango, broccoli and tomatoes. Vitamin C -rich foods include citrus fruits, berries, melons, tomatoes, bell peppers and broccoli. Vitamin D is found in fatty fish and eggs. Milk and 100% juices that are for- tified with vitamin D also are sources of this important nutrient. Zinc tends to be better absorbed from animal sources such as beef and sea- food, but also is in vegetarian sources such as wheat germ, beans, nuts and tofu. Probiotics are \"good \" bacteria that promote health. They can be found in cultured dairy products such as yogurt and in fermented foods such as kimchi.

Aim for five to seven servings of vegeta- bles and fruits daily to get vitamins, miner- als and antioxidants that may support im- mune health. Good hygiene and hand -washing help pre- vent the spread of germs. Remember to wash produce before eating or using in recipes. Clean glasses, forks, spoons and other utensils to reduce the spread and growth of bacteria. Find healthy and appropriate ways to cope with stress, such as meditation, listening to music or writing. Physical activity also is a great way to help manage stress and may help reduce the risk of some chronic diseases that could weaken your immune system further. Lack of sleep contributes to a variety of health concerns, such as a weakened im- mune system. Seven to nine hours is rec- ommended each day for adults, and chil- dren need eight to 14 hours, depending on their age. W H A T A B O U T H E R B A L S ?

P A G E 20 Spring Cleaning Environmental Wellness While the kids are at home and helping in the kitchen, lessen your stress by having them help with some much -needed spring cleaning! Wipe down countertops and all kitchen surfaces such as appliances, cutting boards and utensils. Remember to check the refrigerator and freezer and clean the shelving and drawers where bacteria can hide. Bacteria that can cause foodborne illness aren't always visible so be sure all surfaces including small crevices are cleaned well. Look for unnoticed spills and remove lingering odors. Wipe up spills and clean surfaces with hot, soapy water and rinse well. Be sure to clean under drawers and edges of glass shelves. Check that the refrigerator temperature is set to below 40\u00b0F. To keep the refrigerator smelling fresh and help eliminate odors, place an opened box of baking soda on a shelf. Avoid using solvent cleaning agents, abra- sives and any cleansers that may impart a chemical taste to food or ice cubes, or cause damage to the interior finish of your refrigerator. Throw away foods that are losing their quality or have spoiled for both refrigerat- ed and non -refrigerated items in the pan- try. What's the difference between \"use by\" and \"expiration?\" \"Use by\" or \"best if used by\" date is not a safety -related date. It's the last date recommended for use of the product at optimal quality. \"Expiration\" date means don't consume the product after this date.

Of the hundreds of cleaning products on the market today, most contain ingredients you can 't even pronounce. While it is likely that manufac- turers have conducted extensive testing on these consumer products, the risks posed by their chemical content are uncertain, and, in many cases, probably low. Nevertheless, human health is always well -served by re- ducing exposure to chemicals. Decreased chemical use is also a pollution prevention measure. In short, green cleaning is good for you and good for the environment! Reasons to Make and Use Your Own Green Cleaners: Most of the ingredients you may already have in your home. You save money. Generally, green cleaners work as well as those with harsher chemicals. Green cleaning keeps dangerous toxins out of your home. Where to Find Ingredients: - Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) \u2014 baking aisle of gro- cery store. - Washing soda (sodium car- bonate) \u2014 laundry aisle of grocery store. - Borax (sodium borate) \u2014 laundry aisle of grocery store. - Vegetable oil -based liquid soap (common name: Castile Soap) \u2014 big box stores, large grocery stores, home im- provement stores, natural food stores). - Essential oils \u2014 health food, natural food stores, drug stores, and some big box stores. How Clean Is Clean? Most cleaning jobs only need soap or detergent, water, and a little elbow grease. Some surfaces may need ex- tra attention to control germs: Sanitizers reduce, but do not totally eliminate germs but are usually safer to use. Disinfectants destroy or inactivate germs but tend to be more toxic and must be used with care. Al- ways label all cleaners clearly! Refrigerator Cleaner 1 tablespoon baking soda 1 quart warm water Dissolve baking soda in water. Wipe all surfaces inside and out. For stubborn spots, rub with a paste made from baking soda and a little water. Rinse well with a clean, wet cloth. Glass Cleaner \u00bc cup white vinegar 1 tablespoon cornstarch 1 quart warm water Mix ingredients. Apply with a sponge or spray bottle. Wipe off with cotton or microfiber cloth. Hint: For lint -free results, wipe dry with crumpled black and white news- paper Source: extension.tennessee.edu/ Studies conducted by the Environmental Pro- tection Agency (EPA) show levels of several common organic pollu- tants to be 2 to 5 times higher inside homes than outside. Many of these pollutants come from the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) re- leased from household cleaning products. Indoor pollutants can be reduced by limiting the number of chemicals used indoors. Simplify cleaning and reduce VOCs by using fewer cleaning products. Choose or make prod- ucts that you can use for several purposes. If you use fewer cleaners then you are storing fewer chemicals in your home.

However, the fact that you re consuming more water and refrain from using alcohol and sweet- ened juices provides the liver with the possi- bility to rest, regenerate and process other substances that you take in. It will help flush out the harmful substances through kidneys and skin. Along with that, it aids the natural peristaltic of the colon, which is the bowel movement, and a regular bowel movement aids in toxin removal as well. If the bowel movement is not regular the toxins from the stool go back to the liver. Doctors suggest drinking a minimum of eight and a maximum of 12 glasses of water a day is the best option, depending on your weight and activity during the day. You can absorb water through teas, natural vegeta- ble or fruit juices and water -rich foods like cucumbers and watermelons as well. 2. Apple (juice) and Apple Cider Vinegar An apple a day keeps the doctor away? Seems about right if you consider the effect they have on a digestive system and liver health. Apples are packed with fibers which help the bowel movement and provides for toxin break down. You can consume them raw or like a juice. They are rich in malic acid and pectin that help dispose of toxins and carcinogens, as well as polyphenols that are naturally found in the liver. They also have an anti -inflammatory characteristic that prevents you from developing a condition known as fatty liver. Apple cider vinegar is a traditional medicine for all kinds of ailments. It can help digestion if the environment is not acid enough. Due to various enzymes, minerals and specific acids it is great for any detox. The acids can attach to the toxins and allow them to leave your body. Mix a tablespoon or two in a glass of lukewarm water in the morning to help digestion and flush out toxins. 3. Flaxseed The flaxseed is a high -fiber food which in itself helps in cleansing the large intestine through the bowel movements. What is interesting is that it has two types of fiber: soluble (up to 40 percent) and insoluble (up to 80 percent). Both types of fiber have their own respective effects on the colon - they increase the bowel movement and prevent and cure constipation. In turn, this aids the liver in doing its job as it is not overworked by processing toxins from the stool that remains in your body. The flaxseed is rich in antioxidants and omega:3 fatty acids which also helps the liver and colon cleansing. Since it is rich in fiber, a single tablespoon of flaxseeds makes up a 13 percent of the body 's desired daily fiber intake. Mix a ta- blespoon with a glass of yogurt and leave in the fridge overnight for the seeds to swell, eat it in the morning, it will keep you full for a long time. 4. Leafy Green and Cruciferous Vegetables Leafy green vegetables are spinach, lettuce, chicory and so on. Why are they beneficial? They protect your liver by neutralizing chemicals, metals, and pesticides that you get in touch with either through food or through air and water. They soak up the harmful substances and help your liver func- tion properly. Another thing they do is that they aid bile excretion which is crucial for digestion and breaking down fats. You can eat them raw, steamed and prepared in a juicer. They go well with cruciferous vegeta- bles like cabbage, cauliflower, and broccoli. The two types of vegetables combined in a smoothie or a juice and mixed with a little lemon juice supply you with a powerful ally in the detoxing process. Removing the environmental toxins with leafy greens and providing a better peristal- tic to the colon keeps the harmful toxins out of your body. Research shows that 80% of our immunity is in our Gut Continued next page Physical Wellness P A G E 23 5. Garlic Garlic has several effects on your liver. Firstly, it contains amino acids that dilate blood vessels which lower blood pressure in the liver and the liver contains a lot of blood. Secondly, it is full of selenium which helps antioxidants perform their detoxing role. Lastly, the vitamin B6 in the garlic acts as an anti -inflammatory agent for your liver. Consume it daily in your diet, and if you are reluctant to use it due to the garlic breath it causes, there are dehydrated garlic cap- sules for odorless use. 6. Citruses Like Lemons, Limes, Grape- fruits Citruses are rich in antioxidants and vita- min C and as such, they are a great addition to forcing out toxins from your liver and colon. Grapefruits also contain a substance named glutathione which the liver naturally produces as well. Why is it important? Glutathione plays a significant part in strengthening your immune system, build- ing and repairing of tissue and producing proteins that are of necessity for the body. Eat whole oranges and grapefruits or juice them, it is your choice. A smaller glass of grapefruit juice a day is enough (juice of one or two grapefruits) t get you started. You can even chose to add a little lemon juice to a glass of lukewarm water in the morning to cause bowel movements and colon cleansing. Some people claim that it has the same effect as coffee in waking them up in the morning. Note: After you have thoroughly detoxed your body, you should strive to keep the organs healthy. Yogurt and kefir are foods that help with that. They are rich in probi- otics that protect the colon 's mucus and prevent bad bacteria from inhabiting it. (We mentioned before that processed milk is on the 'don't use ' category, however, if yogurts have less sugar and more active agents they are actually great for your co- lon. Curd is what you should use to regenerate the liver 's hepatocytes. Easily digested and mild it is used as a re- generating treatment for hepatitis, fatty liver, and cirrhosis patients. WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO? So we went through produce you can con- sume during the spring -cleanse of your liver and gut. But is that the only thing that can help you detox? As the matter of fact is, it is not. There are other things that you can do to improve your overall health and help more toxins leave your body. Exercise - participating in a sweating -out session does wonders for your body and for your mind. The water you are taking in comes out through your bowels and urine, however, a part of it comes out through sweat as well. Source: Verywellhealth.com Continued from prior page Physical Wellness P A G E 24 Lifestyle changes like exercise and a healthy diet bump up your levels of IgA, a protein in your immune system that fights infections. It helps keep threats out of your body -- and zaps any that do get in. Research shows that Physical activity may help flush bacte- ria out of the lungs and airways. This may reduce your chance of getting a cold, flu, or other illness. Exercise causes change in antibodies and white blood cells (WBC). WBCs are the body's immune system cells that fight disease . Exercising will make more toxins come out and even faster than if you are not exercis- ing. The physical activity will leave you crav- ing even more water, so it all conveniently works for you.. Exercise helps balance stress hormones such as cortisol. When cortisol is too high, it suppresses your im- mune function The physical movement can improve a sluggish bowel and help poor circulation. You will experience the benefits very soon. If you are not big on exercising, walk or try yoga, it is a low impact activity and offers poses that are specifically designed to help your digestion problems. Detox your mind - medicine, especially an- cient medicine like Greek and Chinese, deals with the connection of the physical illnesses and the mind. They explore how the mind affects the body, and vice versa. It is logical to us that a painful sensation that lasts long can affect our mood making us irritable or sad, however, there is a pro- cess that goes the other way round. When you feel a certain emotion it reflects on your body. If you are happy you are more energetic and so on. So how does this apply to liver and gut? Have you ever felt afraid of something and experienced a sensation of 'gut tied in a knot ' (like get constipated or even get diar- rhea before an important exam)? When you are angry, for example, it reflects badly on your liver ('stir up bile '). This is employed in the four types of peo- ple's personality where choleric (fast, short - tempered, irritable) and melancholic (analytical, quiet, anxious) are related to yellow and black bile respectively. Get rid of any negative emotional influence, forgive and forget, manage your stress. Re- member that negative emotions hurt you and your organs. FINAL WORD To sum up, your liver and your gut do more than pull their weight to keep you healthy and happy. They remove and break down toxins and help your metabolism work per- fectly. Exercise is a great way to boost your health and immunity. We need to eat im- mune boosting food, increase water con- sumption and exercise for optimal for dis- ease prevention , and to properly mange chronic diseases. Eat light and eat cleansing foods, to help you feel more energized, and lighter. So, why not do that this spring why you have time a home.

And, you don't have to be a financial expert. Here are tips to help parents and caregivers show a child why and how to become responsible with money. Engage in regular conversations about money -related topics: That includes dis- cussing with your child what you are doing, and why, when you manage money at home, around town or with the bank. For example, consider talking about similar products that have noticeably different prices at a store, and how you decide what is a good deal. \"If you are using plastic to pay for purchas- es, consider explaining the difference be- tween a debit card, which is like writing an electronic check, and a credit card, which requires the consumer to make a payment in the future,\" said Luke W. Reynolds, Chief of the FDIC's Outreach and Program Devel- opment Section. Consider giving an allowance as a teaching tool. It can be a positive way to teach kids, even those who are preschool age, about money management. But before you give the first allowance, help your child decide how much he or she will spend now and how much to save for future goals. Then, help your youngster see whether that tar- get is being reached by looking at a bank statement online or a paper copy. Also talk through the tradeoffs involved with spend- ing decisions, such as how buying one toy may mean forgoing the opportunity to pur- chase another item the child also wants. \"There are many approaches to how best to structure an allowance, particularly whether to tie it to work such as household chores, so each family will need to decide what is best for them,\" Reynolds added. Think twice before giving a child more mon- ey if he or she runs out of funds before the next allowance payment. That's because part of the purpose of an allowance is to teach savings skills, self -control and the benefits of waiting to enjoy a bigger re- ward. Help your kids develop a healthy skepti- cism of advertising and unsolicited inquir- ies: In general, teach children how to ana- lyze advertisements; they need to know that \"special offers\" often are not the great deal they appear to be. Even young con- sumers are targets for identity thieves and among the victims of scams and rip -offs. Information for parents on protecting chil- dren's personal information from identity theft is available at consumer.ftc.gov . Here are some examples of practical finan- cial strategies for spending less or saving more: Preserve resources by buying what you need. Purchase cleaning supplies, medication, water, healthy and nutritious food. Use the 24 Hour Rule: For any expense over $50, delay spending to give yourself a day to think about it. Ask yourself: \"Is this expense a need or a want?\" and \"How do I plan to pay for it?\" Convert Spending into Labor: To help with decision -making, calculate how many hours of work are needed to earn the net (after -tax) income required to buy some-thing. \"Rubber band\" receipts to your debit card. This will give you a good visual of the amount of spending you are doing and make you think twice before using it again! Save the money earned on \"extra\" pay days. At the beginning of every year, mark paydays on a calendar and highlight the months with \"extra\" pay days. Use at least \u00bd of the \"extra\" income to pay down debt.

From its inception at the First Health Assembly in 1948 and since taking effect in 1950, the celebration has aimed to create awareness of a specific health theme to highlight a priority area of concern for the World Health Organization. Over the past 50 years this has brought to light important health issues such as mental health, maternal and child care, and climate change. The celebration is marked by activities which extend beyond the day itself and serves as an opportunity to focus worldwide attention on these important aspects of global health.

Washington P A G E 31 Stress Awareness Month During this annual thirty day period, health care professionals and health promotion ex- perts across the country will join forces to increase public awareness about both the causes and cures for our modern stress epi- demic. Sponsored by The Health Resource Network (HRN), a non -profit health education organi- zation, Stress Awareness Month is a national, cooperative effort to inform people about the dangers of stress, successful coping strat- egies, and harmful misconceptions about stress that are prevalent in our society. This month, we are all challenged to keep our stress levels low, and our peace levels high. Here are some great ways to keep your mind clear and de -stress if you find yourself getting too overwhelmed. 1. Exercise. You 've probably heard this one before, and even though it 's probably not exactly what you want to do when you're feeling stressed (because laying on the couch and watching movies sounds more appealing), exercising gets endorphins pumping through your brain, which triggers a happy feeling. Exercise lowers your body 's stress hormones like cortisol, and releases chemicals that make you feel more at peace. 2. Think about taking natural supple- ments to help you feel more at ease. Natural remedies like lemon balm, ome- ga-3 fatty acids, green tea, and essential oils are very helpful. 3. Light a candle or turn on the oil diffusers, put on some soft, sooth- ing music and dim the lights. Take a deep breath and count your blessings. 4. Caffeine intake reduction can help (even though it 's tough to kick the coffee!) because caffeine tends to make us jittery, which can cause stress and anxie- ty. 5. Spend time laughing with friends and family. Let yourself have a good time and get your mind off the busy -ness of the real world. April Themes P A G E 32 Do you have a go -to comfort food when you feel stressed? If so, you are not alone. During times of stress, many of us may reach for foods or snacks and often these are high in saturated fats or added sugars. The fact that stress can impact food choic- es is not news. However, are there also foods or nutrients that can help you to reduce stress? O U R B O D Y ' S F I G H T O R F L I G H T R E S P O N S E Your central nervous system releases stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol when you feel anxious or stressed. These hormones trigger the fight or flight response, which gets your body ready for action. For example, your heart can beat more rapidly, your blood pressure may rise and your rate of breathing might increase. Being in a chronic state of stress can cause long term health problems. In addition to feeling anxious, many may become de- pressed, struggle to get a good night's sleep or experience digestive issues? C A N C E R T A I N N U T R I E N T S E A S E S T R E S S ? Research linking certain nutrients to stress management is limited. Recent studies have focused on nutrients the brain needs to function normally. This can include nu- trients like antioxidants or B vitamins. Studies have looked at how supplements may help manage stress but results have been limited. As these nutrients are al- ready important in a healthy eating pattern, the best way to get them is through the foods you eat. For example, fruits and vegetables contain antioxidants along with other nutrients that may work together to promote health. And many foods provide a variety of B vitamins natu- rally, including whole grains, fruits, vegeta- bles, dairy products, beans and meats. Some studies also report a potential link between low levels of nutrients in the body such as vitamin D and stress. These studies did not prove that inadequate in-take of foods with this nutrient causes stress or that increased intake of foods with this nutrients ease stress. However, your body does need it to function normal- ly. And there are lots of foods that contain vitamin D including fatty fish and fortified dairy and soy products. D O V I T A M I N A N D M I N E R A L SUPPLEMENTS COMBAT S T R E S S ? Some supplements claim to help manage stress. At this time, however, the evidence supporting these supplements is limited and much more research is needed. Talk with your health care provider before tak- ing any vitamin and mineral supplements. S T R E S S -B U S T E R S When it comes to food and stress, one of the best things you can do for your body is to choose a balanced, healthful eating style. Participating in regular physical ac- tivity is also beneficial for managing stress. As little five minutes of exercise a day can be beneficial. A Registered Dietitian Nutri- tionist can help you establish an individual- ized healthy eating plan that includes spe- cific food preferences and goals for physi- cal activity. Other ways to help ease stress include: Relaxation activities, such as medita- tion, guided imagery or breathing exer- cises. Socializing with friends and loved ones for emotional support during stressful situations. If stress has you craving crunchy foods, reach for lower calorie, healthful foods such as carrots, celery or plain popcorn. Consider seeking professional help. Stress can become debilitating. Counselors and other health care providers can offer treat- ments to help combat stress. Source: eatright.org Stress , Nutrition & Health P A G E 33 Asthma and diet: What's the connection? If you have asthma, you may be curious about whether certain foods and diet choices could help you manage your condition. There 's no conclusive evidence that a specific diet has an effect on the frequency or severity of asthma attacks. At the same time, eating fresh, nutritious foods may improve your overall health as well as your asthma symptoms. According to research in some research, a shift from eating fresh foods, such as fruits and vegetables, to processed foods may be linked to an increase in asthma cases in recent decades. Although more study is needed, early evidence sug- gests that there 's no single food or nutrient that improves asthma symptoms on its own. Instead, people with asthma may benefit from eating a well-rounded diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables. Food also comes into play as it relates to allergies. Food allergies and food intoleranc- es occur when your immune system overreacts to specific proteins in foods. In some cases, this can result in asthma symptoms. Foods to add to your diet: 1. Vitamin D -rich foods , such as fish, mushrooms, fortified orange juice, soy milk . 2. Vitamin A and Beta carotene -rich vegetables, such as carrots and leafy greens. 3. Magnesium -rich foods , such as spinach ,almonds, avocadoes, dark choco- late.

P A G E 35 Managing a Full House Talk about a full house! If you 've suddenly found yourself and your children stuck at home, find productive and healthy ways to fill the time. Here are some ideas to make the most of your family time at home: Unplug and Connect Children spend on average almost 7.5 hours each day with media while many adults spend 11 hours a day with media. Reducing the amount of time your child or teen (and you) spends with media will have a positive lifestyle impact. Take this time to reconnect as a family rather than increasing screen time. Limit junk food and processed food. Clean the refrigerator and eat fresh produce first to aid in building a stronger immune sys- tem first. Then eat pantry items. Family Meals Gathering around the table to eat as a family has all kinds of benefits. Family meals allow parents to be role models who create a supportive environment that promotes healthy eating. Family meals don't just mean better nutri- tion. Children of families who regularly eat together also are more likely to have high- er intakes of fruits and vegetables and have a healthy weight and are less likely to have behavior problems or use drugs, cigarettes or alcohol when they get older. Plus, they're closer to their parents. Keep meals simple and make extra so you can reheat leftovers later in the week for a quick family meal. Ingredients you can use for more than one meal can be a major time saver. Instead of making just three chicken breasts, consider making six. This way, you can use the extras in other dish- es such as chicken salad or fajitas. When you 're preparing family meals, get the kids involved! Here are some ideas depending on your child's age and ability: Three to five -year -olds: mix together simple ingredients, snap green beans, tear lettuce for a salad, press cookie cutters Six to seven -year -olds: peel raw fruits and vegetables, shuck corn, use a vege- table peeler, crack eggs, measure ingre- dients Eight to nine -year -olds: use a can opener, juice citrus fruits, check the temperature of foods with a thermome-ter, beat eggs, pound chicken on a cutting board Children ages ten and older: slice or chop vegetables, boil potatoes, micro- wave foods, bake foods in the oven, simmer ingredients on the stove Start slow and give your child time to mas- ter each task. Make family meals even more fun by letting your child choose nightly themes and menus. Or switch things up by taking it from the table to the floor - put a blanket on the ground to have an indoor picnic! Get the Kids Cooking . P A G E 36 Children 's Wellness Stay in touch with your child 's school. Many schools are offering lessons online (virtual learning). Review as- signments from the school, and help your child establish a reasonable pace for completing the work. You may need to assist your child with turning on devices, reading instructions, and typing answers. Communicate challenges to your school. If you face technology or con- nectivity issues, or if your child is hav- ing a hard time completing assign- ments, let the school know. Create a schedule and routine for learning at home , but remain flexible. Have consistent bedtimes and get up at the same time, Monday through Friday. Structure the day for learning, free time, healthy meals and snacks, and physical activity. Allow flexibility in the schedule \u2014it's okay to adapt based on your day. Consider the needs and adjustment re- quired for your child 's age group . The transition to being at home will be different for preschoolers, K -5, middle school students, and high school stu- dents. Talk to your child about expec- tations and how they are adjusting to being at home versus at school. Consider ways your child can stay con- nected with their friends without spending time in person. Look for ways to make learning fun. Have hands -on activities, like puzzles, painting, drawing, and making things. Independent play can also be used in place of structured learning. Encour- age children to build a fort from sheets or practice counting by stacking blocks. Practice handwriting and grammar by writing letters to family members. This is a great way to connect and limit face -to-face contact. Start a journal with your child to docu- ment this time and discuss the shared experience. Use audiobooks or see if your local library is hosting virtual or live - streamed reading events. School meal services Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal. Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are provid- ing grab -and-go meals at a central location. Watch your child for any signs of illness. If you see any sign of illness consistent with symptoms of COVID -19, particu- larly fever, cough, or shortness of breath, call your healthcare provider and keep your child at home and away from others as much as possible. Fol- low CDC 's guidance on \"What to do if you are sick .\" Watch for signs of stress in your child. Some common changes to watch for include excessive worry or sadness, unhealthy eating or sleeping habits, and difficulty with attention and con- centration. For more information, see the \"For Parents \" section on CDC 's website, Manage Anxiety and Stress . Take time to talk with your child or teen about the COVID -19 outbreak. Answer questions and share facts about COVID -19 in a way that your child or teen can understand. Go to CDC 's Helping Children Cope with Emergencies or Talking with Children Help Children Continue Learning . P A G E 37 Children 's Wellness About COVID -19 for more information. Teach and reinforce everyday preventive actions . Parents and caretakers play an important role in teaching children to wash their hands. Explain that hand washing can keep them healthy and stop the virus from spreading to others. Be a good role model \u2014if you wash your hands often, they 're more likely to do the same. Make handwashing a family activity . Help your child stay active. Encourage your child to play out- doors \u2014it's great for physical and men- tal health. Take a walk with your child or go on a bike ride. Use indoor activity breaks (e.g., stretch breaks, dance breaks) throughout the day to help your child stay healthy and focused. Help your child stay socially connected. Reach out to friends and family via phone or video chats. Write cards or letters to family mem- bers they may not be able to visit. Some schools and non -profits, such as the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning and The Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence , have resources for social and emotional learning. Check to see if your school has tips and guidelines to help support social and emotional needs of your child. Limit time with older adults, relatives, and people with serious underlying medical conditions Older adults and people who have seri- ous underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID -19. If others in your home are at particu- larly high risk for severe illness from COVID -19, consider extra precautions to separate your child from those peo- ple. If you are unable to stay home with your child during school dismissals, carefully consider who might be best positioned to provide child care. If someone at higher risk for COVID -19 will be providing care (older adult, such as a grandparent or someone with a chronic medical condition), limit your children 's contact with other people . Consider postponing visits or trip to see older family members and grand- parents . Connect virtually or by writing letters and sending via mail.

Arthritis is a disease that impacts more than 50 million Americans, making it the number one cause of disability in the country. That means 1 in every 5 adults, 300,000 children and countless families are affected by arthritis. Arthritis by the Numbers: Nearly 53 million adults have doctor - diagnosed arthritis; that number is expected to grow to 67 million by 2030. Almost 300,000 babies, kids and teens have arthritis or a rheumatic condition. Arthritis is the nation 's No. 1 cause of disability. No matter if you live in a rural area, suburb, or urban neighborhood, walking has been shown to improve arthritis pain, fatigue, function, and quality of life. There is no better time to begin a walking program or recommit yourself to a walking routine than during Arthritis Awareness Month. Walking is a great way for people with arthritis who live in rural areas to be physically active. Walking is recommended \u2014All adults, including adults with arthritis, should get 2 hours and 30 minutes (150 minutes) of moderate -intensity aerobic activity (i.e., brisk walking) per week and do muscle - strengthening activities two or more days a week. If you take brisk walks for 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week, you will meet the aerobic activity recommendations from the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans external icon. Don't think you can walk for 30 minutes at one time? You can break it up into 10 minute sessions and spread it out during the day \u2014walk the dog 10 minutes in the morning, take a 10 minute walk to the post office, coffee shop, or grocery store in the afternoon, and then take a 10 minute walk after dinner.

Quick Tips Tip: One of the best ways to reheat this soup and keep it from being scorched is to use a double boiler. Pour the soup into the top pan of the double boiler and heat over simmering water. If you don 't have a double boiler, place a medium stainless steel bowl over a pan of simmering water. In either case, be sure the water in the bottom pan doesn 't touch the top pan.
