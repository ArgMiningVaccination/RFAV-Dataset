We've got you covered with seven natural solutions to reduce stress & help you get your calm on!", "sitename": "Gaia Herbs", "date": "2023-01-30", "cleaned_text": "If you experience occasional anxiety due to stress, difficult circumstances, or a lack of sleep, you are not alone. These feelings of circumstantial or acute anxiousness (the type that goes away as circumstances change or ease) are a normal, albeit uncomfortable, part of life. REF#476 Since anxiety is inevitable, we must find healthy ways to weather life's storms. Occasional anxiety also serves a purpose; it alerts us that something is wrong so we can take steps to address the problem. However, even occasional anxiety can be disruptive, especially if it's related to a problem that cannot be solved quickly, such as marital issues, an illness, or the loss of a loved one. This is why traditional cultures have turned to natural remedies for anxiety support for centuries.* In this article, we'll explore ten natural remedies for anxiety, including herbs, different types of nature therapy, and more.* 7 Natural Remedies for Anxiety If you're looking for natural ways to reduce anxiety, you've probably tried all the \"greatest hits,\" such as deep breathing, positive affirmations, exercise, herbal teas, and aromatherapy. These excellent coping tools may deserve a space in your natural remedy toolkit. In this article, you'll learn about some lesser-known natural remedies for anxiety, focusing heavily on traditional herbs and science-based lifestyle practices.* 1. Take Ashwagandha for Anxiety, Stress, and Resilience [Ashwagandha](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/ashwagandha), also known as \"Indian Ginseng,\" has long been used in Ayurveda (the traditional wellness practice of India) to reduce stress, support sleep, and promote a calm state of mind.* [Ashwagandha](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/ashwagandha) is an adaptogen that helps the body adapt and thrive under various stressful conditions.* Several studies have demonstrated how Ashwagandha's adaptogenic properties help reduce stress and anxiety. REF#477 REF#478 Research has shown [Ashwagandha](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/ashwagandha) may also help with occasional anxiety by: - [Supporting normal thyroid to better mental and emotional health REF#483 REF#484 REF#485 - Acting as a potential mood-stabilizer by helping support normal levels of tribulin, a marker of anxiety. REF#486 [Ashwagandha](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/ashwagandha) shows great promise in helping reduce stress, promoting a calm state of mind, and quelling occasional anxiety.* Gaia Herbs offers several Ashwagandha formulas, including: 2. Practice Regular Earthing or \"Grounding\" for Stress, Anxiety, and More Human beings once had almost constant contact with the Earth by walking barefoot, bathing in natural bodies of water, and sleeping on the ground. Fast-forward to the twenty-first century, and most of us have lost touch with the simple act of touching the earth daily. This chronic disconnection from the earth can make people feel ungrounded, flighty, or out of touch with the natural world. So, what does this have to do with anxiety? According to new research, getting \"grounded\" via direct contact with the ground or natural water may be a powerful natural remedy for occasional anxiety, sleeplessness, and more. REF#487 Here's the scientific explanation of how grounding works. We tend to think of the human body as a biological entity, which is partly true. However, our brains, nervous systems, and heart all function through electrical impulses. REF#488 The earth is also electrical and provides its inhabitants with a rich source of negative electrons, which act as antioxidants. Some researchers have nicknamed these negative electron antioxidants \"vitamin G.\" The \"G\" stands for \"grounding.\" Modern humans also receive many positive electrons from electronic devices such as computers and other technologies. Researchers believe our intake of positive electrons now far outweighs our intake of negative electrons, which can create imbalances in the body's electrical system leading to: REF#489 REF#490 REF#491 - Anxiety - Sleep disorders - Cardiovascular events - Chronic pain - Inflammation - And other ailments The solution? Try walking around barefoot for 20-40 minutes a day. Studies have shown it can help improve various aspects of mental and emotional well-being while helping reduce stress. REF#489 REF#492 You can also purchase various grounding devices to use indoors while sleeping, exercising, and working. 3. Try Lemon Balm for Occasional Anxiety, Sleeplessness, and Overall Well-Being [Lemon Balm](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/lemon-balm), also known as Melissa officinalis, is a common herb found abundantly in teas, gardens, and even growing wild. Yet, few people realize the incredible versatility of this humble herb\u2014especially for [occasional anxiety](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/ashwagandha-benefits-anxiety).* Studies have shown [Lemon Balm](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/lemon-balm) may significantly and positively affect acute anxiety, mood, stress, calmness, focus, and alertness without serious side effects. REF#493 REF#494 REF#495 It's also been shown effective for promoting sleep REF#496 and provides digestive support. REF#497 [Lemon Balm](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/lemon-balm) is widely available in teas, tinctures, and capsules. It's also easy to grow throughout North America, will re-grow after being cut back, and is a perennial (meaning it regrows after dying back in the winter). You can find [Lemon Balm](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/lemon-balm) in Gaia Herbs Gummies.](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/relax-gummies) 4. Pamper your Gut Microbiome for Greater Physical, Mental, and Emotional Resilience The discovery of the gut-brain axis, also known as gut-brain-connection, has started to change what we thought we knew about how the brain functions. As it turns out, the gut and brain share many similarities. For example, they both house neurotransmitters, like serotonin (of which 95% is stored in the gut REF#499 and [GABA](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/gaba-herbal-support), REF#500 which play a role in anxiety and mental/emotional well-being. Research has also shown that our gut health can directly affect our mental and emotional well-being via those neurotransmitters and levels of inflammation in the gut. REF#501 REF#502 Ultimately, this new frontier in biological psychology requires more research to explain its mechanisms and potential benefits. However, since the gut and brain connection has been scientifically proven, it makes sense to pamper your [gut microbiome](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/gut-health) as much as possible. According to science, some of the [best ways](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/mental-health-awareness-month) to do this are: REF#503 - Eat a diverse, whole-foods-based diet. REF#504 - Spend time outdoors in the fresh air. REF#505 - Spend time in contact with the soil and its beneficial microbes. REF#506 - Reduce stress. REF#507 - Keep things clean, but avoid over-sanitizing. Chemical sanitizers kill good and bad bacteria, which can disrupt microbiome balance over time. - Consider adding probiotic- and prebiotic-rich foods to your diet, such as fermented vegetables, yogurt, kombucha, cooked and cooled potatoes, green bananas, and others. REF#508 - Eat plenty of fiber-rich foods to support elimination and feed good gut bacteria - Avoid unnecessary antibiotics which kill off good and bad gut bacteria. REF#509 - Try and avoid NSAID painkillers, which can irritate the gut lining. REF#510 Learn more about natural solutions for digestive health in: [Gut Health: 10 Tips for Supporting a Healthy Gut.](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/gut-health) 5. Experiment with Tulsi (Holy Basil) for Anxiety Tulsi, also known as \" [Holy Basil](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/holy-basil),\" is one of Ayurveda's most revered and versatile herbs. Like Ashwagandha, it is an adaptogen used extensively to address concerns of body and mind.* Tulsi is also known as \"liquid yoga\" because of its calming properties and traditional use as a mindfulness enhancer pre- or post-yoga practice.* Modern research has also shown the active plant compounds in Tulsi, known as Eugenols, REF#511 can benefit anxiety, mood, and attention. REF#512 It's also been shown effective for protecting the body from pollution and chemical stressors, supporting immunity, REF#513 and reducing stress. REF#513 Tulsi is often taken as a tea but can also be found [as a tincture](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/collections/all/herb-holy-basil) and [in capsules](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/holy-basil-leaf). For more fascinating information about Tulsi, check out [An Essential Guide to Holy Basil](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/an-essential-guide-to-holy-basil). 6. Declutter your Mental Space by Decluttering your Physical Space Nobody likes living in a cluttered space. However, in our consumer-driven, 24-7 society, things tend to pile up around the house, at the office, in the basement, garage, and so on. The [clutter issues](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/gaiaherbs-declutter-your-life) with which so many of us struggle can strain our mental and emotional health. Clutter or excess household items have even been linked to increased stress, anxiety, and fatigue (especially in women). REF#514 The big takeaway here is that a cluttered space creates a cluttered mind. If you struggle with clutter, organization in general, or don't know where to begin, here are helpful starting points: - No time? Consider hiring a personal organizer. - Ready to DIY it? Check out the best-selling book by Marie Kondo: The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up (it's remained a best-seller for a reason). She also has online courses and consultants throughout the world. - Unsure where to start? Browse Pinterest and other online articles for organization hacks, systems, and ideas. - On a budget? Organizing your home doesn't have to cost a fortune. Check out Marketplace, dollar stores, and second-hand stores for shelving, filing cabinets, and other helpful organization tools. You can also use \" [body doubling,\"](https://add.org/the-body-double/)where you organize alongside a video or friend to help motivate you. - Need to take it slow? As a first step, commit to not buying anything new until you decide where to put it FIRST. This simple habit will significantly increase your awareness of where things go and the importance of putting things away. The most important thing is to start somewhere. Pick a space you frequent the most (like your home office or living room) and commit to decluttering and creating a pleasant atmosphere. Chances are you'll be rewarded with less stress and anxiety for your efforts. 7. Try Skullcap for Mood and Sleep Support [Skullcap](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/skullcap-certified-organic) is one of the most widely-used nervines (herbs that support the nervous system) in Western [herbalism](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/herbalism-starter-guide) for s [upporting mood, stress response, and sleep](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/time-to-relax-natural-herbs-tips-for-calming-the-mind-and-body).* effects on mood in healthy volunteers,\" researchers found Skullcap was effective in supporting a healthy mood without causing reductions in energy or cognitive function. [[41]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23878109/) [Skullcap](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/collections/all/herb-american-skullcap) can be taken during the day for stress support and/or at night to promote relaxation and sleep.* You can find Skullcap in several Gaia Herbs formulas, including: How to Start Using Natural Remedies for Anxiety Since we don't always know when stressful situations will occur, it's best to be proactive. With the information in this article, you're armed with several options to help combat occasional anxiety when it rears its ugly head.* Since everyone may respond differently to these remedies, it's a good idea to experiment to discover what works best for you. Some remedies, such as pampering your [gut microbiome](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/gut-health), [decluttering](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/gaiaherbs-declutter-your-life), or taking [Lemon Balm](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/lemon-balm-certified-organic) or [Ashwagandha](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/ashwagandha-root), can be done proactively to support your stress response and possibly reduce acute anxiety in the future. Other remedies, such as taking Tulsi or practicing earthing/grounding, can help create a more immediate calm when anxiousness strikes. [Gaia Herbs Calm ASAP](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/calm-asap) is formulated for this purpose. Many of these natural remedies for anxiety can be used interchangeably to support you proactively and during times of [stress](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/what-does-stress-look-like)...and that's perhaps the best approach. By consistently caring for your physical, mental, and emotional well-being with nutrition, lifestyle, and herbs and having natural remedies for life's ups and downs, you'll be in an ideal position to handle occasional anxiety naturally.
