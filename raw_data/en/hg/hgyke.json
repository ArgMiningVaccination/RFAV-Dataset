Logistical Strategies for Differentiated W heat Classifications. Major Professor: Dr. W illiam W. Wilson. An increasing num ber of quality categories are being added to the grain m arketing system . Wheat is not just wheat any longer. Special categories of wheat that provide unique qualities for end-use products are being specified by purchasers. In addition, wheat that is genetically engineered to withstand Round-up herbicide is approaching com mercial release and could potentially double the num ber of wheat categories. As users of wheat becom e more specific about the quality of wheat they desire, the num ber of quality categories that the logistical pipeline m ust keep separated increases. Determ ining the additional cost of increased grain segregations is an im portant factor in calculating how many different types of wheat categories should be m arketed in a supply chain. The prim ary objective of this research is to develop a m odel that captures the logistical costs of increased grain segregations in the m arketing system . An additional objective is to determ ine how various testing strategies affect logistical costs. A sim ulation m odel was developed to add logistical uncertainty in dem and, receipts, test accuracy, rail deliveries, and transit tim e. Sensitivities were conducted on certain variables to determ ine their effects on logistical costs. Analysis revealed that logistical costs rise as m ore quality categories are added to the system . Pipeline conf iguration af fects cost s, as the num ber of quality categories present at the origination m ay differ from the num ber of categories dem anded at the export elevator. Adding genetically m odified grains increases the num ber of segregations in the system , resulting in a rise in costs due to testing requirem ents and segregation dem ands. iii ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I extend m y appreciation to Dr. W illiam Wilson who has provided m e with a greater understanding of the wheat industry.

PROBLEM Introduction Genetically m odified and differentiated grain products have becom e increasingly popular am ong producers in recent years. Genetically m odified (GM) or transgenic crops have specific inclusive traits that allow for reduced input costs, ease in production, and specialized output characteristics. Health concerns over GM food products have caused the food industry to look at labeling grains that c ontain genetically m odified m aterials. This demand for labeling and segregation by consum ers and processors has m any logistical implications, including increased quality testing, proliferation of product types, and identity preservation/segregation of conventional and specialty (biotech) com modities. Producer acceptance of genetically m odified com modities has expedited the need for segregated, or identity-preserved, channels f or differentiated com modities in the current bulk grain-m arketing system . Moving biotech crops from the farm to the processor and end-user is a m ajor challenge for the United States grain handling and transportation system (Norton, 1998). Norton suggests that im provem ents in genetics m ay outpace changes in the handling and transportation system that will be necessary for producers and end-users to capture the increased econom ic value of specialty crops. Concurrent with these developm ents has been an increase in the production of specialty crops for niche m arkets. End-users are becom ing m ore specific about the quality of the traditional crops that they desire. Many of these specialty grains need to retain their identities in order to capture potential econom ic benefits, which is a challenge for the logistical structure of the grain-handling system . This thesis addresses and analyzes topics 1 related to the increased focus on segregation and the distribution of genetically m odified crops. Problem Elements Segregation and Identity Preservation The cost of segregation includes som e form of identity preservation (IP) of commodities f rom the f arm level to the processing stages. Transportation costs f or grain products are a high percentage of their value, so any increase in m arketing expenses raises the purchasing price and reduces their value. In the past, grain was m arketed as a bulk product, which is considered to be less expensive because econom ies of scale are easier to obtain. Segregating products requires m ore handling and other functions that increase the costs of m arketing grain. According to W ilcke, the process of segregating crops involves separate storage, handling, and docum entation of separation and is called identity preservation (1999). Identity preservation (IP), according to Dan Dye of Cargill, is a \"traceable chain\" of custody that begins with the grower's choice of seed and continues through the shipping and handling system (Dye, 2000). In an identity-preservation system , the com modity in question is kept separate and not com mingled with other sim ilar products. Identity preservation requires separate or thoroughly cleaned storage and transportation equipm ent, which increases logistical expenses. The United States grain-m arketing system has not traditionally been well adapted for segregation or identity preservation. As Hurburgh states, the grain-m arket is not accustom ed to preserving absolute purity in lots that look the sam e (1999). Segregation of commodities could cause a large adverse im pact on the transportation/m arketing system . 2 Van Janssen states that, ten years ago, everything was vanilla-corn was corn, soybeans were soybeans; now we have a variety of di fferent specifications (Cotterill, 2000). For exam ple, in the past, if one wanted wheat, one received generic wheat. Today, wheat is segregated with regard to grade, protein, dockage, falling num ber, and various other characteristics. In the future, there will be m ore options when purchasing inputs, such as genetically m odified wheat that will concentrate on specif ic end uses. GM wheats could be used to m odify gluten and starch contents; create uniform kernel sizes; bolster m ineral content; and im prove wheat m illing, dough properties, and bread and noodle texture (Econom ic Research Service, 1999). Stock-Keeping Unit (SKU) Problem Differentiated categories of com modities have increased the num ber of products that the grain-m arketing system must support. Product categories are often identified as separate stock-keeping units (SKUs). A m ajor problem that needs to be addressed is the added expenses that product differentiation (higher num ber of SKUs) brings to the logistical system . Variety exacts its price in the logistics channel (Ballou, 1999). Ballou adds that when a new item is introduced to a product line, com bined inventory levels rise by 40% or m ore, even though total dem and does not increase (Ballou, 1999). A report in The McKinsey Quarterly says that cutting low-volum e SKUs can perm it com panies to reduce costs significantly (Bonnot et al., 2000). Abernathy et al. state that consum ers are demanding greater variety in products and that their preferences are getting harder to predict (2000). The SKU problem is em erging in the grain-m arketing system as buyer specificity increases the categories of grain dem anded. In the past, forecasting dem and was simpler; with product proliferation (m ore SKUs), the forecasting problem has becom e more 3 complex. The controversy regarding biotechnology-derived (genetically m odified) commodities has increased the num ber of grain categories. Genetically m odified grains could potentially double the num ber of product varieties that m ust be handled and transported through the logistical system (Bullock et al., 2000). In addition, consum ers and custom ers have becom e more dem anding on specificity, which has led to a rise in the number of non-genetically m odified categories of grain that buyers seek. Bevilacqua (1999) says that grain custom ers are clearly becom ing m ore specific in what they purchase. Thus, the expenses that arise from an increase in the num ber of segregations need to be estim ated. Testing and Quality Testing com modities to assure conf ormance to a certain threshold level of genetic material is a m ajor area of concern for grain m arketers. Bullock et al. (2000) state that the major costs of genetic segregation and identity preservation depend crucially on the tolerance levels that are set. Burchett states that a low tolerance level f or genetically modified organism s in som e identity preserved crops increases risk (2000). Industry experts have stated that a one percent threshold is nearly im possible to achieve while a five percent level would be m anageable (Sonka et al., 2000). A publication by the Organisation for Econom ic Co-operation and Developm ent (OECD) (2000) agriculture com mittee found that a zero tolerance level could increase prices up to 50% over the genetically m odified variety, whereas a 1% tolerance level increases costs only about 15% above m arket prices. It is difficult to detect if a com modity has been genetically m odified with the hum an eye. Specialized technical tests m ust be used to verify that the product conform s to a 4 specific threshold level. The other option is to rely on claim s by the producer (farm er). However, if a prem ium is being paid for non-GM crops, it is m ore likely that false statem ents could be m ade. Technical tests for genetic identification are necessary for this reason. However, genetic tests have a wide range of accuracy and costs. Tests also need to be conducted to assure that grain is certified with respect to grading standards and desired protein levels. Buyers often specify a certain grade level and protein content along with m any other non-grade factors. Testing provides quality assurance to the buyer as test results m ust show that the level of quality desired for specified characteristics have been m et by the supplier. Genetically Modified Organisms Concern over genetically m odified organism s is acting as a catalyst to develop a two-tier m arketing and identity preservation system for grains. Dif ferent genetic traits have been adapted to agricultural com modities for agronom ic reasons, such as resistance to weeds and insects, and for supplying desired product characteristics. Grains and oilseeds can be genetically custom ized for alm ost any output trait, including taste, texture, nutrient content, and m edicinal purposes. There are m any benefits associated with genetically modified organism s, but there are also concerns regarding the safety of genetically modified com modities. Concerns need to be addressed because, as Martin (2000) states, biotechnology is ubiquitous and it im pacts everyone; since biotechnology can affect everyone, skeptical consum ers of this technology are resisting it. Genetically m odified crops have even been com pared to nuclear power, which was once unaccepted but now a part of everyday life. 5 The United States Departm ent of Agriculture (USDA) states that agriculture biotechnology is a collection of scientific t echniques, including genetic engineering, that are used to create, im prove, or m odify plants , anim als, and m icro-organism s (USDA, n.d.). Maryanski (n.d.) of the Food and Drug Adm inistration states that old biotechnology is traditional plant breeding such as cross-fertili zation of selected plants to produce desired traits. He defines new biotechnology as gene sp licing or genetic engineering that is m ore precise, m aking it possible to predict changes without introducing extraneous undesirable traits (Maryanski, n.d.). Genetic engineering becam e feasible in the 1970s for plants, but agriculture products were not com mercially available un til the 1990s (Transitions in AgBiotech, 1999). Regulators approved the first Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) food product in 1990, and by 1994, the first GMO food item , the Flavr-Savr tom ato, arrived in superm arkets (Eggerstrom , 2000). A genetically m odified organism (GMO) is a living organism that has had som e characteristic im proved by genetic engineering, which is defined as the capability to insert genes from one species into another (Hurbur gh, 1999). Gachet et al. (n.d.) add that genetically m odified organism s contain supplem entary genetic inform ation in com parison with their conventional counterparts. Genetic organism s are grown with special genetic characteristics inserted within them to enha nce the plant by tailoring it with the ability to resist disease and herbicide, to input vitam ins and m inerals that the generic product does not posses, and to offer m anufacturing benefits. Acceptance of Genetically Modified Organisms Agriculture biotechnology is currently described as occurring in two different 6 waves. The first wave includes genetic varieties that provide benefits to producers by providing production gains. The second wave refers to the enhancem ent features that crops may bring to m anufacturers and consum ers. The first wave of genetically m odified crops includes im proved resistance of organism s to certain insects and herbicides. Producers and the environm ent are the m ain beneficiaries of this new technology. Exam ples of first-generation crops include Round-up Ready, Liberty Resistance, and Bacillius thur ingiensis (Bt) varieties. Round-up Ready crops are resistant to the powerful Round-up herbicide, whereas Liberty is tolerant to Liberty herbicide. Bacillius thuringiensis (Bt) crops are im planted with a gene f rom a fungus that produces crystal proteins that are lethal to insect larvae including the European corn borer. The benefits of first-ge neration biotechnology include a new level of protection against pests and weeds (Berglund, 2000). Other benefits of agronom ic biotechnology characteristics include fewer health risks to farm ers, less farm pollution of soils and waters, and cost savings for farm ers. The second wave of biotechnology focuses on output or specialty traits. This generation of crops increases the value of the com modity from the farm to the consum er or end-user. Second-generation crops include the insertion of genetic traits with respect to end-use characteristics such as high oil content, nutraceuticals, low phosphate levels, industrial purposes, m edicines, and vaccines. Consum ers benefit the m ost from the second generation of agriculture biotechnology. Genetic Adoption The adoption of genetically m odified crops by producers is astounding. The first significant com mercial sowings of genetically m odified crops took place in 1996 and 7 almost exclusively in the United States (Com mission of the European Com munities, 2000). In 1996, there were 2 m illion hectares (5 m illion acres) of genetically m odified crops planted, and in just three growing seasons, the acreage increased to 40 m illion hectares (100 m illion acres) (Irish Tim es, 2000). It has taken farm ers only 3 years to adopt GM Round-up Ready soybean varieties to the sam e levels of hybrid corn, which took 7 years in most states and 20 years in others (Kalaitzandonakes, 1999). Table 1.1 illustrates global adoption rates for various genetically m odified com modities. Figure 1.1 provides a graphical representation of biotech planti ngs by year. Figure 1.2 shows GM planting percentages by com modity for the United States. Table 1.1.

In addition to the crops listed in Table 1.1, there are genetically m odified varieties of sugarbeets, tobacco, and potatoes. Geneti cally m odified canola has seen rapid adoption since its introduction in Canada. Canadian canola acreage was not even 5% of total acreage in 1996 but was near 50% of overall canola acreage in Canada by 1998 (Brown, 1999). The United States, China, Canada, and Argentina were the early m ajor adopters of GM technology. The United States accounted fo r 69.1% of all genetically m odified crops grown in the world for 1999 (Com mission of the European Com munities, 2000).

Source: OECD (2000) Study. 9 1987, the USDA has approved 3,855 field trials of new agricultural products that are derivatives of 48 different plant species, with m ore than 80% of these trials occurring in the past 4 years (Norton, 1998). W hitman reports that over 40 plant varieties have com pleted all federal requirem ents by the FDA and the USDA for com mercialization (2000). Gachet et al. (n.d.) add that there are approxim ately 50 approved genetic varieties in the United States. Table 1.2 and Figures 1.3 and 1.4, derived from the Com mission of the European Com munities (2000), illustrate the 1996 and 1999 planting percentages for genetically modified crops by country. Table 1.2. Genetically Modified Planting Percentages by Country Country Year - 1996 Year - 1999 United States 55.5% 69.0% Com mission of the European Com munities (2000). More than half of Am erica's grocery products m ay contain genetically m odified ingredients (Eichenwald et al., 2001). It is estim ated that there are around 50 foods widely sold today in superm arkets that have genetically m odified m aterial in their ingredients (Eggerstrom , 2000). Wheat is a m ajor world crop that does not currently have a genetically m odified variety on the com mercial m arket. John B. Pitchford of the Grain Inspection Packers and Stockyard Adm inistration (GIPSA) said that there are no transgenic wheat varieties for sale or in com mercial production in the United States at this tim e (2000). Meanwhile, a brochure from Monsanto (n.d.) reports that Round-up Ready wheat has been evaluated in Share of World Produc tion by Count ry for 1996 USA 56% Argentina 2%anada 4%China 38% Figure 1.3. Genetically Modified Planting Percentages by Country for 1996. Source: Com mission of the European Share of World Produc lly Modified Planting Percentages by Country for 1999. Source: Com mission of the European Com munities (2000). 11 greenhouses and field trials since 1994. Monsanto expects to have a genetically enhanced wheat variety available between 2003 and 2005, pending approval by United States and Japanese regulatory officials (U.S. W heat Associates, 2001). However, U.S. W heat Associates is com mitted to obtaining custom er acceptance and to having a testing and certification program in place before genetically altered wheat is com mercialized (2000). Importance of Segregation-United States Exports Segregation of genetically engineered com modities will be vital f or the United States export m arket. The United States exports m ore genetically m odified products than any other country. The United States accounted for 57% of global soybean exports and 76% of world corn exports in 1998/99 (Bullock et al., 2000). Meanwhile, the United States accounted for 47% of global soybean and 41% of world corn production, respectively, in 1998/99. The European Union (EU) and Japan are large im porters of U.S. grain. The EU and Japan are also the m ost vocal in the protest for genetic labeling requirem ents. The European Union im ported 25% of U.S. soybean exports, and Japan im ported 35% of U.S. corn exports in 1998/99 (Bullock et al., 2000). If the United States grain industry is not able to keep genetically m odified and non- genetically m odified products separated, U.S. export m arket share m ay be lost. A loss in market share is already occurring with United States corn exports to Japan due to the StarLink contam ination in the United States co rn supply. Japan and other Asian countries are sourcing their corn supplies from countries that do not produce the StarLink variety. A loss in export m arket share decreases prices and has a negative effect on the agriculture econom y of the United States. 12 If genetically m odified wheat is introduced in the United States, countries that are opposed to genetically m odified wheat m ay abandon their ties to the United States if the genetically m odified varieties cannot be properly segregated from the non-genetically modified wheat supply. The possibility of a loss in export m arket share is one reason for discussions regarding a synchronized release date for GM wheat with Canada. Proper segregation m eans that the genetic content of a shipm ent is below a specified threshold level of genetic m aterial present in the non-genetic wheat lot. If custom ers find that proper segregation is not occurring, the United States wheat export m arket share decreases, and the wheat sector of the agricultural econom y suffers. Perceived Risks by Consumers Consum er and environm ental groups around the world are voicing concerns about biotechnology. The possibility of an increased num ber of allergenic reactions due to the introduction of new organism s in the food supply and the environm ent is a m ajor concern. Another fear is that it is difficult to determ ine the im pact of genetically m odified organism s on hum an health and the environm ent. Crenson (2000) reports that environm entalists and some scientific studies have raised concerns that genetically m odified crops could wipe out native species, disrupt natural cycles, and cause other ecological dam age. A Cornell University study indicates that Bt corn m ight have harm ful effects on Monarch butterflies. There is a potential for new super weeds to develop if resistance to the herbicides being applied develops. One last apprehension by producers m ay be that genetically m odified seeds are m ore expensive to purchase. As genetically m odified varieties are introduced to the m arketplace, it is im portant to rem ember that biological system s reproduce, so once a gene is introduced in the environm ent, it cannot just be returned to the laboratory. 13 Resistance im plies that applications to control weeds and insects m ay be lim ited in the future. Plants that are engineered f or herbicide tolerance and weeds will cross-breed, resulting in the transf er of the herbicide resi stance genes from the crops into the weeds, causing \"superweeds\" that would be herbicide tolerant as well (W hitman, 2000). The transfer of genes could result in m ore dangerous chem ical applications to control these \"superweeds\" in the future. Growers will also need to plant refuge areas of non-genetically altered plants for insect resistance m anagem ent program s. The Environm ental Protection Agency (EPA) requires Bt corn producers to plant a 20% refuge area to non-Bt varieties within one-quarter m ile of the production area (Martin, 2000). Consumer Acceptance Global acceptance of genetically m odified organism s has not occurred. Europe has taken the lead in the protest against genetically engineered food. European consum er resistance m ay be due to recent food scares as well as the poor regulatory abilities of the European Com munity. In Europe, people rely greatly on the environm ental and consum er groups for inform ation and have little trust in the governm ent and certain regulators (Berglund, 2000). A survey in the United Kingdom shows that genetically m odified organism s in food are the third largest concern for people (Murphy, 1999). Many companies are not accepting genetically m odified com modities for processing; som e of them include Frito-Lay, Procter & Gam ble, Gerber, Heinz, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Seagram s, and Nestle. Fast food giants McDonalds and Burger King are even seeking non- GM potatoes for their french fries (Kilm an, 2000). A Dow Jones survey indicates that 65% of Japanese processors are planning to switch to non-GMO grains and that they expect an increase in procurem ent costs of around 20% (Hurburgh, 1999). Meanwhile, it is estim ated 14 that at least 60-70% of food products curre ntly on grocery store shelves m ay contain GMOs (Kam chen, 2001). Some com panies and countries are accepting this new technology. For exam ple, the Cam pbell Soup Com pany and Kellogs use genetically m odified ingredients in their products. Many scientists have found or concluded that there is little to no danger for human consum ption of genetically m odified cr ops. In addition, governm ent officials m ust believe that there is no harm to hum ans from the consum ption of genetically m odified food products since the Food and Drug Adm inistration does not require special labeling. Dr. Pollack, a m aster in the field of genetics, stated in the m id 1980s that putting new genes into bacteria did not have the unintended c onsequences of m aking the bacteria dangerous (Eichenwald et al., 2001). In addition, research over a ten-year period shows that GM plants did not survive for long in the wild or produce \"super weeds\" (\"GM Crops Unlikely to Becom e Super W eeds,\" 2001). Table 1.3 provides an illustration of various countries' stances on accepting genetically m odified wheat. Table 1.3. Importing Countries' Stance on Accepting Genetically Modified W heat Country Accept Genetically Modified W heat Egypt No Japan No Philippines No Mexico Yes Korea No Russia No Nigeria No Taiwan No Israel Yes Colom bia Yes Italy No Source: Sands (2000). 15 American Stance on Biotechnology American citizens and consum er groups have concerns over genetically m odified commodities. However, they also have conf idence in the regulatory approval system and the ability of governm ent agencies to m onitor food safety. In the United States, the federal governm ent perform ed eight years of biologi cal and food safety testing on herbicide resistant soybeans before they were com mercially released (Eggerstrom , 2000). A Gallup poll indicated that 80% of United States res pondents feel confident that food available in most grocery stores is safe to eat (Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc., 1999). Another survey states that two-thirds of consum ers favor biotechnology, expect to benefit from it, and expressed confidence in the Food and Drug Adm inistration's (FDA) labeling policies (Martin, 2000). The FDA is the governm ent arm that is responsible for labeling food products. The agency has taken the stance that genetically m odified and conventional commodities are substantially equivalent. In the United States, two other agencies are involved in the regulation process for GM com modities. The Anim al and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is responsible for protecting against pests and diseases. Com panies m ust present inform ation such as new genes introduced, the origin of the genes, and show that precautionary m easures are being used in the field tests to avoid contam ination of other species. The Environm ental Protection Agency (EPA) oversees the safe use of pesticides and herbicides. The EPA monitors biotechnology crops that are either resistant to herbicides or able to produce their own toxins. Benefits for Consumers and Producers Many benefits are associated with genetic engineering. Biotechnology possesses 16 the possibility to com bat hum an diseases, prom ote hum an health through nutraceuticals, combat anim al diseases, fight hunger by resisting plant diseases and im proving yields, and reduce pesticide and insecticide use (USDA, n.d.). Foreign gene insertion can im prove agricultural crop protection, shorten the tim e required to obtain new varieties, im prove yield and quality, produce pharm aceuticals, generate vitam ins or biopolym ers for industry, improve nutritional quality, and confer resistance to insect larvae or to herbicides (Gachet et al., n.d.). A few benefits of GM crops include reduced scouting tim e, decreased chem ical applications and health risks associated with handling chem icals, and im proved weed and insect control. Other factors include im proved nutritional profiles, crops that produce pharm aceuticals and oral vaccines, and industrial uses such as for the replacem ent of petroleum in plastics. Biotechnology allows for plants to be grown in non-ideal conditions through drought-tolerant genes or cold-tolerant gene insertions. A major benefit of biotechnology crops is the reduction in pesticide usage. Berglund (2000) indicated that pesticide usage is greatly reduced with the use of genetically m odified crops. An exam ple is given for the cotton industry, in which one million gallons of pesticide usage was reduced in 1999 due to planting Bt cotton varieties (Berglund, 2000). Less pesticide or herbicide application translates into less environm ental damage from chem ical run-of f. Soil erosion will be decreased due to the increased opportunities of no-till cultivation. A Nebraska farm er estim ated that GM soybeans had a cost savings of $20 per acre in production costs over conventional farm ing m ethods (Burgdorfer, 1999). Runge and Jackson estim ated that savings for farm ers in 1998 due to GM organism s in Canada and the United States were $465 m illion (1999) . In addition, GM crops m ay increase yields, which is also a benefit to the producer. 17 Labeling and Regulations At the biosafety protocol m eeting in Montreal, it was agreed that all genetically modified exports should be labeled (\"US Farm ers Desert GM Crops,\" 2000). Over 130 countries agreed to the regulation of labeling all genetically m odified exports. Countries that practice the precautionary rule when there is insufficient scientific evidence available on topics will benefit from this labeling requirem ent (Moro and Boccaletti, 2000). The precautionary rule is the idea that dam age should be avoided in advance and em phasizes prevention rather than incurring the costs of failures (Cunningham and Unnevehr, 2000). Some foreign governm ents have groundwork in place or have im plem ented national labeling laws. The European Union Com mission im plem ented a labeling law through Regulation (EC) 49/2000 which fixes a tolerance level of one percent for each single ingredient on the condition that the operator has taken appropriate steps to avoid the use of genetically m odified grains as a source (Com mission of the European Com munities, 2000). Europe's labeling law applies to restaurants, pubs, and other businesses that sell m eals. Japan began enforcing its requirem ents for safety assessm ents on foods produced through recom binant DNA technology as of April 1, 2001 (US Grains Council, 2001). Japan's labeling guidelines include a five percent tolerance level for GM ingredients in products qualifying as \"non-GM\" (U.S. Grains Council, 2001). Russia announced that, after July 1, 1999, any im ported GMO product would require testing and licensing (Runge and Jackson, 1999). Other countries with concerns regarding genetic content in their food products include New Zealand, Australia, Mexico, Spain, Portugal, Hong Kong, and Korea. In fact, a survey in South Korea indicated that 95% of consum ers believe labeling is needed (Wisner, 1999). 18 Labeling food products is increasing the need for a two-tier m arketing system . The introduction of labels forces the com modity system to segregate non-GM and GM commodities so that desired characteristics for food products can be obtained. Labels also allow the consum er to m ake a choice between alternatives and to be better inform ed. StarLink The StarLink situation in the United States has raised concerns over the approval process for GM crop varieties. StarLink is a vari ety of Bt corn resistant to insects that was approved for production and use in feedlots but was not deem ed fit for hum an consum ption due to the CRY9C protein that was inserted into the seed. The possibility of increased allergenicity from the inserted protein rendered StarLink not safe for hum an consum ption. Regulatory approval was granted with the stipulation that the product could only be used for livestock and that the com pany would educate the producers on the requirem ents of growing this variety. Due to the inability to keep StarLink corn out of the hum an food chain, it is no longer available for production. StarLink has tainted the reputation of biotechnology, and stricter guidelines are likely to occur as a result of the problem s. Incentives for GMO/Specialty Crop Production One of the m ain reasons for growing specialty crops is to increase profits. An Illinois survey indicates that increasing prof it, earning a prem ium, diversifying risk, and gaining future contracting opportunities are reasons to grow specialty crops (Norvell, 1999). Specialty crop interest has grown from 14% of surveyed producers in 1996 to 23% in 1998 (Norvell, 1999). Another survey showed that 18.5% of respondents were producing specialty crops and another 26% were interested (Swanson et al., 1999). 19 Premiums Prem iums associated with first-generation GM crops are m ostly non-existent. Prem iums will develop as the second generation of biotechnology em erges onto the m arket and m ore specialty com modities are grown. Currently, prem iums are being paid for non- GM crops. Berglund states that prem iums for tailored traits m ay be as little as 20 cents to several dollars per bushel depending on m arket dem and and specifications (2000). Burgdorfer (1999) states that grain handlers ar e paying a prem ium of 10 cents per bushel or more for non-GM crops to m eet European dem and. Martin (2000) expects that prem iums to Asia will range from 10 cents to 15 cents for non-GM soybeans. Howie (2001) of Feedstuffs reports that prem iums for non-GM corn range from 7 to 12 cents per bushel and soybean prem iums range from 20 to 25 cents per bushel. The Tokyo Grain Exchange trades non-GM soybean futures, and non-GM prem iums can be estim ated by taking the difference between the U.S. soybean futures and the Tokyo non-GM soybean futures (Bullock et al., 2000). A brief article titled \"Econom ist: Prem ium for Non-GMO Doesn't Pay Enough\" in the Septem ber 11, 2000, issue of Agweek reports that the difference between the Tokyo Grain Exchange's non-GM soybean contract and the conventional soybean contract has averaged between 35 to 40 cents per bushel. Consum ers m ay be reluctant to pay a prem ium for a product that was once a generic good. One survey found that 20% of respondents would pay a prem ium for non-altered products, and of that 20%, only 25% would pa y a prem ium of 10% or m ore for non-GM products (Schulz et al., 2000). Prem iums may vary with the supply of grain on the m arket. For exam ple, if there is a large volum e of non-GM seed planted, the prem ium is likely to decrease. 20 Objectives The objective of this study is to evaluate the logistical cost of increasing categories of grain and testing on a grain pipeline. Specific objectives include (1) to evaluate the impacts that testing and conform ity (tolerance) constraints bring to the supply chain, (2) to find the im pacts that producers and buyers of genetically m odified wheat m ay place on the logistical system , (3) to evaluate the im pact of testing accuracy on the logistical system , (4) to evaluate logistical costs when categories of grain increase, (5) to show how m ore storage bins better position an elevator to m eet export requirem ents when specificity increases, and (6) to determ ine which variables a ffect the logistical co sts of m arketing grain when m ore categories of grain that require thorough testing are added to the logistical pipeline. These objectives provide a starting point for research into the concept of the stock- keeping unit (SKU) problem . Determ ining how l ogistical costs are affected by an increase in categories due to m ore buyer specificity along with genetic acceptance levels is achieved from the aforem entioned objectives. Methodology The m ethodology in this research is based on logistical m odels. A m aterials requirem ent planning (MRP) approach is used to pull/push grain through different points in the supply chain to m eet the dem and requirem ents at these locations. A stochastic simulation m odel is developed using @Risk to capture random ness in testing accuracy, demand, receipts, rail car placem ent, and transit tim es. One-way substitution of commodities of high to low quality and conventional to genetically m odified wheat is an 21 important concept to the m odel. Testing accuracy and incom ing grain quality are crucial variables to the estim ation of the logistical costs that additional grain segregations m ay bring to the grain-m arketing system . Organiz ation Chapter 2 provides background inform ation about topics of im portance to this study. In addition, previous studies, which are related to the costs of segregation, identity preservation, stock-keeping units (SKUs), and testing/inspection, are reviewed. The theoretical m odel is described in Chapter 3. The em pirical m odel and data sources are the main content in Chapter 4. Results are presented in Chapter 5. The conclusions of this research are presented in Chapter 6. Summary The grain-m arketing system must adapt to handle the current em phasis on quality, segregation, and identity preservation. Consum ers worldwide have concerns about the safety of genetically m odified products and would like a choice in their purchases. Producers raise genetically engineered crops because of the agronom ic benefits, such as easier production m ethods. Producers also raise specialty crops desired by end-users due to the prem iums associated with the specific crop. The current grain handling system has evolved into a bulk handling system ; now it m ust adapt to handle different categories of products. Determ ining how the increased num ber of segregations and quality testing affect the cost of m arketing grain is a new challenge that is im portant to the future of the grain handling system . Mark Singer, an agriculture econom ist with the Chicago Federal Reserve 22 Bank, says the challenges are to segregate GM from conventional seed, preserve the identity of com modities, test for genetically altered seeds at various points in the supply chain, and provide product labeling (Cotterill, 2000). 23 CHAPTER 2 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND PREVIOUS STUDIES Introduction Increased segregations and quality testing can have a large im pact on the logistical costs of m arketing grain. An increasing am ount of research has been conducted on how identity preservation and segregation increase logistical costs. The f unctions of identity preservation and increased segregation encom pass the m ajority of the literature related to this research. Segregation and identity-preservation literature also includes research on the stock-keeping unit (SKU) problem . Literature regarding the SKU problem itself is lim ited, and it is difficult to find theoretical inform ation on how to capture or quantify the expenses associated with increasing SKUs or categories of grains. Testing is the other m ain focus of this study. New testing m ethods for genetically modified (GM) organism s have evolved, but lim ited inform ation is known about their accuracy. Most of the research com pleted to date does not include testing costs, or detailed sampling and acceptance plans for testing genetically m odified grains. An increasing number of studies do include testing, but they focus on testing at only one point in the logistical pipeline and do not analyze the entire supply chain. This chapter focuses on the logistical issues of testing and increasing grain segregation. Logistical scheduling strategies are presented along with how testing affects logistic flows. The SKU problem is analyzed, and testing and sam pling issues are discussed. The m ost relevant studies related to this research are sum marized at the end of each section. 24 Logistical Strategies Logistical strategies are becom ing m ore im portant in grain-m arketing as the need for crop segregation rises. Better logistical strategies often result in lower costs throughout the grain pipeline. Matt Gibson, ConAgra W heat Trader, in a class discussion stated: \"I spend 10% of m y time managing price risk and 90% of m y time managing logistical risks\" (2000). Logistical strategies are becom ing m ore com plex with the addition of new categories of grains and the arrival of GM com modities in the m arketplace. Consum ers have becom e more discrim inating in their food preferences and are, thus, dem anding the segregation of GM crops due to concerns about their effect on hum an health. As m ore com panies and countries im plem ent labeling laws for GM products, the marketing and storage system must be able to accom modate this dem and for specificity. Most m ajor food processors are encouraging segregation at the farm and elevator levels so that specific qualities and quantities of com modities can be preserved throughout the pipeline. Logistics Logistics is an essential elem ent in the grain-m arketing system . Transportation is the logistical link between producers and consum ers. Transportation is a derived dem and that creates utility and value for the product in transit. Agriculture is the prim ary user of transportation services in the United States a nd accounts for nearly one-third of all freight transportation services provided in the United States (Agricultural Transportation Challenges, n.d.). Ballou defines logistics as the process of planning, im plem enting, and controlling the efficient, cost-effective flow and storage of raw m aterials, in-process 25 inventory, finished goods and related inform ation from point of origin to point of consum ption for the purpose of conform ing to custom er requirem ents (1999). In addition, he states that the m ission of logistics is \"to get the right goods or services to the right place, at the right tim e, and in the desired condition, while m aking the greatest contribution to the firm\" (Ballou, 1999, p.4). Inventory and transportation factors are very im portant to the grain-m arketing system . By using logistical strategies, m arketers aim to reduce the risks and costs associated with grain m oving through the pipeline. Careful m anagem ent of transportation and inventories can greatly reduce logistical risks and costs. Davis (1993) states that inventories exist m ore or less as sim ple insurance against uncertainty. Ballou (1999) adds that cost reduction, capital reduction, and service im provem ents are typical objectives of implem enting logistical strategies. Supply Chains Supply chain m anagem ent, according to Sim chi-Levi et al., is a set of approaches utilized to integrate suppliers, m anufactures, warehouses, and stores so that m erchandise is produced and distributed at the right quantities to the right locations at the right tim e in order to m inimize system wide costs while satisfying service level requirem ents (Sim chi- Levi et al., 2000). Van der Vorst defines an agricultural supply chain as the planning and control of the flow of m aterials and inform ation from agriculture producers to end-users (Lentz and Akridge, 1997). The supply chain encom passes m any logistical com ponents that include transportation, custom er service levels, inventory m anagem ent, inform ation flow, and order processing (Ballou, 1999). Sengupt a and Turnbull (1996) state that integral factors in the supply chain include forecasti ng, planning, scheduling, and transportation. 26 The supply chain encom passes the process of m anaging the m ovem ent of m aterials and products from one area of processing to various other processing cells. Goals of supply chain m anagem ent are to elim inate the uncertainty associated with the m ovem ent of goods, to reduce inventories, and to decrease overall system costs. This concept is increasingly popular in business applications. Inform ation technology system s that foster communication provide an im portant foundati on for effective supply chain m anagem ent and reduce uncertainties in the pipeline. New inform ation technology software that allows one to track inventories or goods within the supply chain provide for m ore efficient logistical operations. Push and Pull Approaches There are two basic approaches in logistical strategies, labeled as pull and push methods. Traub (2000) states that push system s work off dem and forecasts and pull system s are based on dem and. The pull approach views each stocking point as independent of all others in the logistic channel (Ballou, 1999). W hen each point in the pipeline is considered separately, control over the inventory at each point in the supply chain is exhibited, and desired quantities of products are chosen with respect to local conditions. Movem ent or production in a pull system is initia ted as a reaction to a current dem and. In a pull system , the request for goods originates at a higher level of the system and is pulled through from the various levels of production (Nahm ias, 1997). Benefits of pull system s, according to Sim chi-Levi et al. (2000), are reduced lead tim es, lower inventory levels, and decreased system costs. In a push system , decisions about inventory are m ade independently, and the tim ing and replenishm ent order sizes are not necessarily well coordinated with production lot 27 sizes, econom ical purchase quantities, or order size m inimums (Ballou, 1999). This approach is used when the benefits of econom ies of scale outweigh those of low inventory levels achieved by a pull system . Production and m ovem ent of a product in a push system is com pleted in anticipation of future dem and. Forecasts for dem and or production are necessary in a push system . Nahm ias (1997) says that, in a push system , item s are produced based on a plan or forecast and pushed to the next level. Sim chi-Levi et al. (2000) state the following problem s that are asso ciated with push system s: (1) push system s are slow to react and som etimes even unable to react to changes in the m arket place; (2) product obsolescence m ay occur in a push system as consum er preferences and dem and changes for a certain product; and (3) inventory and carrying costs are generally higher in a push system . Logistical Scheduling Models Scheduling m odels are used to determ ine the flow of goods through a logistical pipeline. One m ethod of scheduling logistics is the concept of requirem ents planning. Requirem ents planning is an idea that was form alized in the 1970s. The objective of requirem ents planning is to m inimize the inventory carrying costs associated with the supply chain. Dem and is the term used to describe the requirem ent needed, and supplies of the dem anded products are tim ed or planned to be available when they are required. A forecasting m ethod is used to determ ine requirem ents or dem and in forward periods. Requirem ents planning also includes the use of safety stocks because of the uncertainty in demand. If the tim ing is not planned effectively, the supplies are available from a safety inventory. 28 Material Requirements Planning Material requirem ents planning (MRP) m ethods try to avoid, as m uch as possible, carrying item s in inventory through precise tim ing of m aterial flows to m eet requirem ents (Ballou, 1999). It is a preferred m ethod when dem and is reasonably known due to the uncertainty of the forecasting com ponent. If dem and is forecast to change, MRP planning adapts to this new level of requirem ents. Nahm ias (1997) says that MRP m ay be considered a top-down planning system in that all production quantity decisions are derived from dem and forecasts. Material requirem ents planning is defined as a form al, m echanical m ethod of supply scheduling whereby the tim ing of purchas es or of production output is synchronized to meet period-by-period operating requirem ents by offsetting the request for supply from the requirem ents by the length of the lead tim e (Ballou, 1999). The trade-off in costs associated with MRP concepts is between having the m aterials arrive before they are needed, in which case they are subject to a holding charge, and the expected cost of the materials arriving after they are needed so the m aterials are subject to a late charge. Ballou adds that the challenge of scheduling m odels (MRP) is to determ ine the optim al tim e to release the request for m aterials ahead of requirem ents (1999). A major problem with MRP m odeling is that not all uncertainties are taken into account. Uncertainties include changes in dem and that were not captured by the forecast and the variance in lead-tim es. Ballou (1999) adds that the challenge of MRP is to find the optim al release tim e for m aterials to m eet requirem ents. There is uncertainty associated with the release tim e as the required tim e for the transportation com ponent of the supply chain m ay vary between points. Most MRP m odels use a fixed lead-tim e for 29 transportation, which does not account for this lead-tim e uncertainty. Distribution Requirements Planning Distribution requirem ents planning (DRP ) is another logistical m ethod of requirem ents planning that is an extension of m aterials requirem ent planning ideas. Distribution requirem ents planning shows futu re planned shipm ents that aid decision makers in the areas of transportation capacity planning, vehicle dispatching, and warehouse order filling (Ballou, 1999). A benefit of distri bution planning is that it allows the supply chain to be m anaged collectively instead of at independent points. More integration allows for increased flexibility to react to changing s ituations. DRP begins with a forecast dem and for a product at a point close to the end-user. W orking backwards and com bining the forecasted dem and at individual levels to aggregate levels at the warehouses and production facilities allows for better estim ations of the gross requirem ents for the specific product. Just in Time Just in tim e (JIT) m eans that the entire supply chain is synchronized to respond to the requirem ents of operations or custom ers (Ballou, 1999). Just in tim e is classified as a pull system . Each position in the JIT system is initiated by another point in the supply chain. This m ethod is preferred for high value goods because inventory levels are decreased throughout the system , which m inimizes the carrying charges of holding inventory. More frequent purchases in a pu ll system also reduce inventory carrying costs. When dem and is very stable, just in tim e is a good m ethod to use due to m inimum inventory levels and responsiveness. Nahm ias (1997) states that JIT does not work well when dem ands will vary signif icantly over tim e as it is unsatisf actory f or com municating 30 basic changes in the process, whereas MRP planning is able to forecast anticipated changes and transm it the inform ation to all parts of the productive system . Random fluctuations in demand are not captured by either MRP or JIT. The benefits of JIT are that m inimum inventory levels are achieved, carrying costs are lower, supply chain relationships im prove, and the supply chain becom es more responsive. Stock-Keeping Unit (SKU) Problem A main focus of this research is on a logistical issue called the stock-keeping unit (SKU) problem . The problem is to try and quantify how additional segregations or products increase expenses to the logistical system . Product variety increases the complexity of the logistical network as noted by Ballou (1999). Com plexity rises due to the need for m anaging and estim ating separate dem and forecasts for each SKU. As categories becom e more specific, there is increased uncertainty about the volum e of each SKU that is dem anded. There is also uncertainty about the substitution that m ay take place between sim ilar SKUs (Handfield and Nichols, 1999). W hen there are m any substitutable products for consum ers to choose from , there is an unknown cost of having that particular item available. Researchers state that the challenge in the m arketplace is to m anage brand im age effectively while also m anaging stock-keepi ng units (\"SKUs: Taking Stock of More than Brands,\" 1998). For a brand considering extending its product line, there is a trade-off between investm ent and support costs with the new m odels and their resulting sales and profits on the rest of the product line (\"SKUs: Taking Stock of More than Brands,\" 1998). Finding the optim al num ber of SKUs m ay ensure m aximum output at less cost, m inimize 31 downtim e, increase equipm ent longevity, increase m aterial optim ization, and increase personnel attitude change (Koss, 2000). Sengupta and Turnbull (1996) give an exam ple of how product proliferation explodes in the supply chain. Planning 1,000 SKUs for an organization that has 10 suppliers, 10 plants, 10 distribution centers, and a planning horizon of 12 tim e periods needs 12 m illion place holders for each com bination of SKUs, supplier, plant, and distribution center. This num ber of placeholders grows exponentially with the increase in any facet of decision-m aking. The exam ple illustrates that m anaging product variety can greatly reduce the com plexity of the logistical system . Product Variety The SKU concept of increasing products carries over to the grain industry in the form of different quality categories required by the grain-m arketing system . For exam ple, a grain m anager m ay try to keep a wide range of quality segregations in inventory to m eet various dem and requirem ents. Grain m anagers hold a wide a range of grain separations to ensure that the grain and grades in their f acility are able to m eet upcom ing vessel requirem ents (Bevilacqua, 1999). Bevilacqua adds that product variety due to an increasing num ber of grains and grades has an im pact on effective workspace at an elevator (1999). A problem with increased product variety is that segregated products are often in competition with each other, and predicting dem and becom es more com plicated. Difficulty in calculating dem and is especially true in the grain industry where dem and for genetically modified com modities and conventional com modities m ay be hard to separate. W hen 32 demand is m ore difficult to predict due to substitutable products, higher inventory levels must be m aintained to ensure the sam e service level (Sim chi-Levi et al., 2000). As the num ber of stock-keeping units in the supply chain are lowered, inventory decreases due to the consolidation of safety stock. Thilm any (1999) states that a slash in SKU num bers stream lines inventory m anagem ent processes because the retailers do not have as m any item s to track. Gus Durso, a beverage category m anager, states in an article by Barnack (1996) that lim iting SKUs to a m anageable num ber is good in order to warehouse and m erchandise products better. In addition, Larson and DeMarais (1999) report that m ore stock on display increases the chance that a SKU is seen and considered for purchase. Having fewer substitutable goods on shelves allows for larger displays, which could increase product throughput. Stock-Keeping Unit Effect on Transportation Transportation costs would typically increase when there is m ore product variety because sm aller lots are shipped and econom ies of scale for shipping are seldom reached. Transportation usually represents the m ost im portant elem ent in logistics costs for m ost firms (Ballou, 1999). Ballou (1999) states that product proliferation can increase inventories and decrease shipm ent sizes. Ballou adds that transportation costs can be reduced by shipping in larger quantities that require less handling per unit (1999). Im pacts on costs could be twofold if sim ilar lead-tim es are m aintained, as sm aller am ounts of products are shipped, causing larger holding inventories at warehouses, which increases transportation and warehouse costs (Sim chi-Levi et al., 2000). Another expense associated with transportation is dem urrage. Dem urrage is a penalty charge on a shipper for holding transportation conveyances beyond an allotted free 33 time for loading or unloading. Dem urrage charges are an im portant consideration when planning the logistical flow of goods. Many re searchers believe that dem urrage costs m ay increase due to m ore segregation. For exam ple, it m ay take longer to load a vessel since export facilities need to accum ulate enough product to do so (Cotterill, 2000). The transportation function of the logistics network is becom ing m ore com plex as product variety increases. Stock-Keeping Unit Effect on Inventory Costs Inventories are a m ethod to relieve uncertainty in dem and and ingredient quality uncertainty. Holding inventory ties up capital and leads to carrying costs. Inventories can cost from 20% to 40% of their value per year (Ballou, 1999). Carrying costs include space costs for volum e usage in a building, capital costs of the invested m oney tied up in inventory, insurance and taxes, inventory risk due to deterioration, theft, dam age, or obsolescence (Ballou, 1999). Ballou (1999) gives the following reasons for holding inventories: (1) reduced transportation and pr oduction costs, (2) coordination of supply and demand, (3) to aid in the production process, and (4) to assist in the m arketing process. Davis (1993) believes that inventory is an insurance for protection in an uncertain world. This insurance com es at an expense. Although there are benefits to holding inventories, these benefits have an expense associated with them labeled as a carrying cost. Increased storage costs are incurred in a logistical system that segregates. In an identity-preservation system for grains, m ore bin space will be required; instead of having everything in one large bin, there will be a need to split it apart (Rustebakke, 1999). Van Janssen of Consolidated Grain and Barge Enterprises said that not very m any grain companies have unlim ited bin space, which m akes segregation tim e consum ing (Cotterill, 34 2000). More product variety m ay also increase carrying costs due to the possibility of non- substitutability between segregations. Other Costs Associated w ith Mo re Stock-Keeping Units (SKUs) A major expense with increased product variety m ay be the capital cost of accom modating the storage of segregated product categories. More warehouse space or shelving m ay be required to keep products separated. For grains, new storage bins and grain paths m ay be required to keep the identity of quality categories preserved. Capital improvem ents m ay be necessary to keep custom ers satisfied and to m eet purity threshold requirem ents. There are increased m anagerial costs associated with segregating due to the complexity of segregating com modities. It is also likely that handling and adm inistration costs would rise as m ore segregation is required. Managerial costs m ay increase at a decreasing rate due to the learning curve idea. For exam ple, it m ay be a big change in managerial concepts to segregate f rom 3 to 4 com modities, whereas m oving f rom 19 to 20 segregations m ay not take m uch m ore effort. Com plexity occurs not only in m anaging the storage of the goods, but also in disputes over quality, which involve the testing aspect, and in the coordination of inland and export m ovem ents. Every logistical com ponent m ust be more integrated due to the quality issue and the increased expenses that dem urrage adds to the system . Alternative Strategies for the SKU problem Typically, com panies want to reduce their SKUs to lessen their logistical complexities, which, in turn, should lower costs. A m ethod often used to m anage stock- keeping units is the ABC or 80/20 approach. The 80/20 approach im plies that 80% of the 35 sales are generated by 20% of the com pany's products. The 80/20 m ethod differentiates products into a lim ited num ber of categories; then, one applies a separate inventory control policy to each inventory category (Ballou, 1999). For exam ple, group A m ay be stocked more heavily than group B, and group B is stocked deeper than group C. Group A is the best-selling product that accounts for 80% of the profits while Group C products have low demand and generate less profit for the com pany. The idea behind the 80/20 rule is that products are not equally im portant in term s of sales, profit, m arket share, or com petitiveness, so each product should be treated separately. This concept has som e bearing on the grain industry as elevators m ay decide to handle only common quality categories that can be easily passed on to the next point in the grain- marketing pipeline. Handling only com mon quality segregations reduces the num ber of storage bins required and lessens the operating com plexity, but also decreases the elevator's ability to satisf y niche m arket dem ands. Postponem ent is a concept utilized to delay the final production and distribution of a product until custom er dem and is known. In essence, end-use products are not shipped in anticipation of dem and. Sim chi-Levi et al. (2000) call postponem ent \"delayed differentiation\" and define it as generic (singl e) products being shipped as far as possible down the supply chain before variety is added. Final production possibilities in the distribution chain m ay include labeling, packaging, assem bly, and m anufacturing. For exam ple, a generic product m ay be sent to a distribution center where the final production occurs to tailor the product to final custom er dem and. The advantage of postponem ent according to Sim chi-Levi et al. (2000) is that custom er dem and across all products has been aggregated, which im plies a m ore accurate dem and forecast with a m uch sm aller 36 variability, leading to reduced saf ety stock. Postponem ent is not a possibility in the grain m arket. The grain is differentiated at its first stage, based on certain quality character istics such as protein, grade factor, and soon on the genetic content. To realize the product's full benefit, segregation needs to occur at the first stages of m arketing, which would defeat the benefits of postponem ent. Standardization lowers variety and reduces the segregations that m ust be handled by the supply chain. Ballou states that standardization in production is created by interchangeable parts, m odularizing products, and labeling the sam e products under different brand nam es (1999). Having substituta ble goods that are different by brand nam e or that can be custom com pleted at the custom er point in the supply chain are the benefits of standardization. Standardization is closel y related with the concept of postponem ent. Standardization is a challenge in the grain-m arketing system . It is likely that consum ers will not treat genetically m odified foods and their non-m odified counterparts as perfect substitutes. Equal treatm ent of GM and non-GM foods is not likely due to perceived quality dif ferences between them . With the f irst generation of genetically modified organism s, non-genetically m odified products m ay be substituted for genetically modified goods but not vice versa due to consum er preferences to have non-genetically modified products. Consolidation is creating large shipm ents from small ones, which results in substantial econom ies of scale (Ballou, 1999). There are trade-offs between lead-tim es, carrying costs, and custom er service due to the transportation rate breaks for larger-volum e shipm ents. Consolidation m ay be in the form of vehicle consolidation in which m ore than one pickup or delivery is placed on the sam e vehicle for m ore efficient transportation; 37 warehouse consolidation, which allows for the transportation of large shipm ent sizes over long distances and the transportation of sm all shipm ent sizes over short distances; and temporal consolidation in which orders from custom ers are held so that larger shipm ents may be m ade at one tim e rather than m aking a num ber of sm all shipm ents (Ballou, 1999). Consolidation m ay be a possible m ethod to lower expenses associated with m ore SKUs in the grain industry. If elevators in the sam e geographic regions pooled their inventories of SKUs and shared storage bins for lower volum e classifications of grain, they could realize a volum e transportation incentive and better storage utilization. Literature on the Stock-Keeping Unit (SKU) Problem The subject of SKUs, or stock-keeping units, has evolved from business and is a new m ethod of approaching the problem s associated with increased quality segregations in the grain industry. One drawback of the SKU st udies is that they focus on inventory policy strategies and do not provide great depth on ot her logistical factors. However, past research does provide a background to the problem of increasing SKUs and dem onstrates that it is an area that needs to be addressed. Handfield and Nichols (1999) present a case study on the issue of costs associated with stocking every SKU at a shoe store. Three alternative inventory strategies are compared in this study that include stock every unit, stock the top selling SKUs using the 80/20 rule (pareto inventory approach), and do not stock any SKUs but express deliver them in one to three days. A sim ulation m odel is developed to answer m any of the \"what if\" questions associated with the stocking scenarios, including dem and and preference uncertainty, the willingness of the custom ers to have shoes shipped to them if a no stocking policy is im plem ented, and the probability of the item being in stock. The m odel does not 38 account for possible substitutions or switching behaviors of custom ers. The conclusion of the research is that a \"pareto\" inventory strategy in which a portion of SKUs are stocked in the local inventory while the rem aining portion is maintained at a distribution center or the next upstream point in the supply chain provides the highest net incom e. This approach has m any im provem ents over the other strategies analyzed. The im provem ents include significantly reduced inventory, savings in purchase costs, im proved inventory turnover, and im proved profitability. In this approach, decisions are m ade on which SKUs to stock, and special orders are m ade attractive for item s not stocked to keep lost sales to a m inimum. The increased num ber of SKUs in inventory for the full stocking approach decreased prof itability. The f actors contributing to the loss in prof itability include an increased average inventory and holding costs, a lower inventory turn, and a higher purchasing cost. The other concept of using express delivery when no inventory is maintained is difficult to analyze and com pare to the other strategies. A display only shoe store is not considered to be a traditional shoe store, and if custom ers do not realize that it is not a traditional shoe store before entering, the assum ptions m ade on lost sales are difficult to draw. Abernathy et al. (2000) exam ined the costs and benefits associated with controlling inventory. The first point that is presented in the research is that SKUs often have different demand levels, and if SKUs are differentiated to this level, inventories can be reduced on some SKUs and increased on other SKUs. Another point m entioned is that sm aller volum e sales for individual SKUs tend to vary m ore due to the lower pooled dem and for that SKU. An exam ple using suit coats is used to illustrate the dif ference in dem and for different 39 SKUs or, in this case, suit coat sizes. Th e authors state that by fine-tuning inventories using SKU-level dem and, a m anufacturer can increase profits and reduce inventory risks. Four different m anagem ent techniques in respect to inventory are analyzed. They include m inimizing stock outs, m inimizing i nventory costs, balancing stocks outs and inventory costs, and m aximizing profit while re ducing inventory risk. In the first three scenarios, a single inventory policy is used. However, in the fourth m ethod, a SKU-level policy is im plem ented. The SKU-level inventory policy returns the highest profit in this research. Alternative sourcing strategies for different SKUs is the next area of exam ination by Abernathy et al. (2000). The options are to source offshore, which is less expensive but has a higher lead-tim e, or to use a reduced lead-tim e strategy that has higher m anufacturing costs. Abernathy et al. (2000) found that a mixed strategy, in which low-variance SKUs are m ade offshore and high-variance SKUs are sourced from a short-cycle plant, provides the highest prof itability. The process of determ ining percentages f or sourcing starts with finding each SKUs variability. It is recom mended that separate sourcing policies for these groups be used to m aximize profit. Another c onsideration is inventory risk. If inventory risk is high, shorter-cycle sourcing tim es should be im plem ented. A coefficient of variation (CV), which is the ratio of the standard deviation of weekly dem and divided by the average demand for that SKU, is used to determ ine the am ount of inventory needed for a fill rate. SKUs with a high CV require m ore safety stock. A sim ulation m odel is used so dem and uncertainty can be included in the calculations. The authors found that, by using a SKU-level inventory policy, carry costs are reduced, sales rem ain relatively high, and production costs are kept in check. 40 Segregation and Identity Preservation Segregation and identity preservation are sim ilar concepts. Segregation involves separate storage, handling, and docum entation of separation and is called identity preservation (W ilcke, 1999). Dye (2000) states that segregation involves a separate marketing system for genetically m odified crops and traditional crops. Dye (2000) adds that identity preservation is a traceable chain of custody that begins with the farm er's choice of seed and continues through the shipping and handling system . Currently, som e food processing and beverage com panies are im plem enting segregation program s for grains. Rom ahn (1999) says that segregation m ay even extend to livestock and poultry farm ers so that biotech free m eat, m ilk, and e ggs can be offered. Segregation m eans that the m arket is offering a choice. Challenges for the Grain-marketing System In the past, the grain-m arketing system was less concerned with segregation. It was a bulk system in which grains were blended to add value, and volum e was a m ethod used to achieve cost reductions. The trend towards differentiation and specialization in the marketplace today requires segregation, or identity preservation, to preserve the value that is added by various quality categories. As Sonka et al. state, for the value of agricultural biotechnology to be realized, crop identity needs to be m aintained in the production and transportation, handling, and logistical supply chains (2000). In addition, regulations for labeling food products as containing genetically engineered ingredients have expedited the need to segregate raw com modities based on their characteristics f or meeting end-user requirem ents. 41 Farm ers and elevators represent the first stage of segregation. The farm level is the ideal location f or segregation due to relatively sm all storage f acilities. Segregation at the farm level m ay provide prem iums for the producer. Many country elevators are not well suited for segregation because they have developed into bulk facilities designed for volum e throughput and not for sm aller lots of specialized products. In addition, incentives for volum e shipping, such as unit and shuttle trains, have greatly influenced the structure of the grain handling industry. Elevators operate on low m argins and try to obtain low per unit costs through their receiving, handling, storing, and shipping of grai n efficiencies (Ginder, 1999). Ginder adds that elevators m ake a profit by running high volum es of standardized com modity products through their facilities with a m inimum of special handling (1999). A bulk com modity system is well suited towards this type of efficiency since special handling is not required. In a bulk system where only sm all num bers of segregation are required, elevators can consolidate shipm ents by blending various qualities together because there is not a need to preserve identities. Blending can increase elevator m argins because quality is not given away and various qualities of grain are m ixed to achieve a given m inimum quality standard. Blending also allows f or small lots of varying quality to be consolidated into larger lots, which m ay lead to lower transportation costs. Maltsbarger and Kalaitzandonakes (2000) found that value-added ac tivities, such as blending or grinding, or carrying spreads, are relinquished in an identity-preserved supply chain. There are m any possible points where com mingling of products can occur when segregating com modities. Com mingling is ref erred to as the inadvertent m ixing of products that increases the chance of the pr oduct losing its unique identity and becom ing an 42 undesirable product. Segregation of com modities with m inimal mixing is difficult for m any existing elevators. Many elevators will be ch allenged with storage and handling constraints as the num ber of quality categories required for them to handle increases because m ost elevator storage configurations are not well adapted to handling sm all lot sizes. Large storage bins m ay not be f ully utilized if lower volum es of more quality categories or products with unique identities are added to the logistical system . Bullock et al. (2000) state that a rise in segregations m ay exploit problem s at elevators and export facilities that are inefficiently located and have too few and too large storage bins, too few separate grain paths per f acility, and inef ficient types of equipm ent which are m ore dif ficult to clean than would be econom ically feasible. In addition, increased categories of grains could m ake shuttle train technology less feasible for elevat ors since elevators m ay have m ore difficulty in accum ulating the required quantities to m eet the volum es required by this low-cost transportation m ethod. Baum el (1999) adds th at handling m ore types of grains reduces elevator capacity and causes problem s for efficiently receiving grain at harvest tim e and reduces effective storage capacity. Genetically m odified organism s may double the types of grains, so instead of segregating by just quality, the elevator m ust also segregate by genetic characteristics (Bullock et al., 2000). Doubling the num ber of grains adds com plexity to the supply chain, as discussed in the SKU problem and pr oduct variety sections. Increased categories of grain reduce generic com modity volum es. Proper segregation with low contam ination levels by elevators requires separate unloading and storage system s to avoid com mingling different grain grades. Separate grain paths at elevators or even elevators dedicated to the delivery of genetically enhanced com modities m ay be the best m ethod to reduce costs 43 associated with genetic purity levels. Bullock et al. add that the m ost econom ical way to avoid com mingling in elevators is to dedicate separate grain paths for non-genetically modified and genetically m odified com modities (2000). Elevator Adoption Rates for Segregation Many surveys have been adm inistered to determ ine the percentage of elevators that are segregating com modities based on genetically enhanced traits. A survey by the American Corn Growers Association shows th at 91.4% of grain elevators in the United States were not segregating GMO corn (Sm ith, 2000). Another survey by Sparks companies indicated that 8% of Midwestern grain elevators segregated soybeans and 11% segregated corn (Steyer, 1999). A survey conducted in the spring of 2000 found that 25% of elevators planned on segregating GM from conventional corn while 20% said they would segregate GM and conventional soybeans (Roseboro, 2001). Roseboro (2001) indicated that, in 1999, a Grain Journal survey showed that only 9% of elevators segregated non-GM and GM grains. Many elev ators that accept biotech varieties do not export their grain to other countries where m ost of the concern over GM com modities is found. Segregation Positions from Grain Trading Firms Major grain handlers are urging handlers and producers to segregate differentiated commodities. Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) announced first that it preferred segregation of com modities due to trends it was experiencing in consum er dem and. The inform ation in this paragraph on grain handlers is from an article in the Hot Off the Cob publication by the National Corn Growers Association (1999). ADM advises grain suppliers to segregate all conventional and genetically enhanced grain to take advantage of niche m arket and 44 potential em ergent prem ium pricing opportunities. ADM is accepting European Union approved GM grain based on the producer's word and is paying possible prem iums. Cargill is accepting GM varieties based on the producer's word and channeling them to the proper m arkets. ConAgra is segregating GM varieties based on the word of the producer and m arketing the grain as genetically m odified to appropriate m arkets. Consolidated Grain and Barge is accepting GM varieties and offering prem iums for conventional varieties. The com pany is encouraging growers to segregate and identify the grain as genetically m odified or conventional. AE Staley is not accepting any European Union unapproved GM varieties but is accepting European Union approved varieties. Segregation is not a quick or easy answer to the problem s facing the grain handling system . Delivering products that have been segregated and identity preserved through the market channel requires a lot m ore com munication am ong firm s than has existed in the past (Ginder, 1999). United States grain com panies m ay require five to ten years to guarantee complete segregation of genetically m odified and non-genetically m odified com modities (Rustebakke, 1999). The concepts of segregation and identity preservation are sim ilar, and complete segregation is virtually equal to an identity-preservation system . Identity Preservation Dye (2000) of Cargill states that identity preservation is a traceable chain of custody that begins with the farm er's choice of seed and continues through the shipping and handling system . Identity preservation is an old concept but is increasing in popularity in recent years due to the increase in specialty and genetically m odified crops. Lowell Hill adds that an increase in identity-preservation production is occurring because consum ers are getting m ore specific about what they want (Anderson, 1999a). 45 Identity-preservation system s operate at higher costs than the generic com modity system . The increased expenses are attributed to the strict specifications that m ust occur in this type of system . Extra labor and capital are needed to clean equipm ent and build new structures for the proper preservation of products. If a low tolerance level is set, identity preservation costs increase due to m ore specific needs and the increased risk of being out of conform ance. The tolerance level of genetic content is a m ajor concern for industry participants operating identity-preserved system s. Identity preservation is a m ethod aim ed at reducing contam ination to ensure purity of a product. Product purity is very difficult to achieve due to the m any possible contam ination points in grain production and throughout the m arketing system . Wayne Beck of Pioneer states that no one can guarantee 100% non-genetically m odified grain (Horstm eier and Klintberg, 1999). Identity preservation and certification program s increase logistical costs but also reduce the risk of not m eeting quality conf ormance to strict specifications. Testing and inspection m ethods are being further developed to ensure that quality specifications are being attained in the m arketplace. Producers and grain handlers are required to exercise greater care and control to enable the delivery of supplies with high purity when they are needed (Anderson, 1999b). Wilcke (1999) em phasizes that detailed records of planting date, field location and size, seed identity, inputs used, harvest date, crop yield, the storage bin num ber, crop delivery date, vehicles used, and the nam e of the person delivering the crop needs to be recorded; in addition, sam ples of the crop should be kept until the buyer is satisfied with the quality of the delivered com modity. 46 Review of Logistical Studies Focused on Segregation and Identity Preservation A num ber of studies are related to this research topic on increased grain categories. Identity preservation and segregation research is the m ost relevant. Recent studies by Hurburgh (1994), Herrm an et al. (1999), Kruege r et al. (2000), and Brester et al. (1996) have focused on the segregation of grains at th e country elevator level. Other research has focused on logistical strategies and the risks of m arketing hom ogenous grain from inland to export term inals. Literature on Segregation Costs at Country Elevators A focus in recent research has been to determ ine the cost of segregating grain. Many researchers have been working to identify and determ ine the costs associated with segregation and identity preservation. Studies estim ating the costs of grain segregation have been com pleted by researchers working for governm ent agencies and academ ic institutions. Hurburgh (1994) is a front-runner in the literature of segregating grain by type or quality characteristic. His 1994 research on soybean segregation at an Iowa elevator is cited in m ost works. Hurburgh estim ated the costs of segregating high oil soybeans from regular soybeans. A whole grain near-infrared transm ission analyzer (NIRT) is used to segregate unground soybeans arriving at a country elevator by protein and oil content. The NIRT test adds a cost in two m anners. The two costs include (1) the actual cost associated with testing the product and (2) a queuing cost. Hurburgh found that the cost of segregating high oil/protein soybeans from regular soybeans is 3.7 cents per bushel. Costs were grouped to a grading category and a ha ndling category. Grading costs include the 47 following: (1) tester cost, (2) operate tester, (3) data equipm ent, (4) wait tim e, (5) sam ple storage, (6) accounting, (7) standardization, (8) software, and (9) disputes. The grading category was found to be 51% of the increase in costs. The handling category includes (1) waiting tim e, (2) pit labor, (3) m odifications, (4) underutilized storage, (5) m isgrades, (6) new storage, and (7) loss in receiving. Handling costs account for 49% of the increase. Krueger et al. (2000) exam ined the costs associated with receiving an increasing number of grains. A stochastic sim ulation m odel is used to quantify segregation costs. The authors found that elevator operations becom e more com plex as the num ber of grain types that m ust be handled increases. A lim iting factor for m any elevators is their storage configurations, which are not situated for handling an increased num ber of low-volum e grain categories. Quality testing f or genetic m aterial is a system bottleneck which results in a queuing cost. Results show that elevator e fficiency has an inverse relationship to the number of grades handled and that costs increase as m ore segregations are received at a country elevator. Herrm an et al. (1999) conducted research on segregation at a country elevator. A stochastic sim ulation m odel was developed to an alyze the effects of segregation. Different elevator configurations which varied by num ber of dum p pits, drives, and bucket elevators were evaluated. The crop is divided into zero (generic com modity), two, and three segregations to estim ate the costs of increased segregations. Results from this study vary over the com bination of segregations, elev ator configuration, and elevator operating efficiency (burden). Results show that the cost of segregating 3 grades ranges from 6.47 cents per bushel to 1.93 cents per bushel, and for 2 grades, the range is from 5.58 cents per bushel to 1.88 cents per bushel. 48 Maltsbarger and Kalaitzandonakes (2000) also exam ined the costs associated with identity preservation of grains at a country elevator. The m ajor focus of their research is the loss in revenue due to hidden costs, such as the inability to grind and blend grains. They also center on how various elevator asset configurations affect costs. Coordination and segregation/testing costs are also exam ined. The following variables are analyzed as coordination cost factors and include (1) farm er search costs, (2) advertising, (3) follow-up calls, (4) farm visits, (5) buyer call delivery, (6) weekly m eeting, and (7) farm er calls. The following variables are grouped under segregation costs: (1) sam ple analysis cost, (2) m isgrades, (3) m aintenance, and (4) disputes/labor. The next set of factors is categorized as opportunity costs and includes (1) under-utilized storage, (2) lost grind margin, and (3) spread opportunity. These variables are analyzed under five separate scenarios under three separate elevator configurations. The authors report that m ore stringent tolerance levels increase identity-preservation costs. A sim ulation m odel found that the costs of segregating high-oil corn ranged from 16.4 cents per bushel to 36.6 cents per bushel. Literature on Logistical Pipelines The following studies focus on the transportation of grain from inland term inals to a destination m arket. The content of this area of research involves logistical costs and risks associated with the grain-m arketing system . In addition, som e studies evaluated the benef its and costs of identity preservation system s. Lentz and Akridge (1997) exam ined the costs and benefits of alternative supply chains for soybean segregations. Their research includes transportation and m arketing expenses, and is an extension of the country elevator study com pleted by Hurburgh in 49 1994. The m ain goal of the research is to determ ine the supply chain costs for each pound of end product produced, in this case soybean peroxidase. Four alternative supply chains are exam ined, and the estim ated costs associated with each one determ ine the optim al supply chain strategy. The authors found that a bulk supply chain requires a larger volum e of input to produce a given level of output, whereas high peroxidase soybeans require a much lower volum e of soybean input for the chosen level of output. The enhanced output of soybean peroxidase derived from the identity-preserved supply chain that segregated high peroxidase soybeans from the regular soybeans exceeded the costs of segregating the different quality categories of soybeans. Wilson and Dahl (2000b) exam ined the logistical risks of m arketing grain in the Canadian system . Past research showed that an increase in grades is a m ajor lim iting factor in the efficient m ovem ent of grain from the producer (farm ) to the port. A com ponent of the research labeled as m isgrades was shown to have a large effect on deferring shipm ents and dem urrage costs. Misgrades occur when the grain does not conform to contract specifications. Logistical risks included in the m odel are uncertainty in vessel arrivals, inventory levels of grain at the port, m isgrades that arrive at port, and the rail car unload rate. Other factors that can cause supply disruptions are uncertainty in dem and, quality, and perform ance. The study focuses on dem urrage costs and exam ines trade-offs and logistical risks. Carlson (1998) exam ined logistical risks associated with m arketing hom ogenous corn between an inland and export term inal. Uncertainties included in the study are yearly supplies of com modities, deliveries into the system , railcar and barge placem ents, vessel arrivals, and transportation transit tim es. The focus of the research is on estim ating 50 demurrage penalties or expenses. A stochastic sim ulation m odel was developed using a materials requirem ent planning (MRP) approach. The MRP m odel pushes grain through the pipeline based on expected dem and at a point in the supply chain for a given period of time in the f uture. Reichert and Vachal (2000) present a study on identity-preservation shipm ents. The study provides a cost analysis and com parison of bulk versus container m ovem ents. Many benefits of containerized shipping are included, and a justification for their use is thoroughly analyzed. A sim ple com parison concludes the study by com paring transportation expenses of shipping soybeans from Iowa to Japan across alternative m odes, including container, truck, single rail car, and un it train shipm ents. Truck transportation is found to be the m ost expensive at $4.05 per bushel, and unit trains are the least expensive at $1.65 per bushel. The difference in unit train versus container shipm ent costs are reported to be 33 cents per bushel. McVey (1996) addressed the issue of quality in the grain supply chain. He states that categorizing grain with uniform physical attr ibutes produces lots of grain that are m ore easily m erchandised. McVey adds that the form ation of the current grading and standards system is to provide m arketing sim plicity through the classification of like qualities. McVey says that the current bulk system has evolved to categorize grain based only on soundness, whereas grain is becom ing m ore differentiated in both soundness and intrinsic attributes. He states that differentiation th rough intrinsic attributes will place great stress on the current system . He found that elevator handling costs for generic goods range from 10.9 to 12.2 cents per bushel. Increm ental handling costs are estim ated at 1.42 to 3.13 cents per bushel. McVey also says that the cost of segregation will be f acility specif ic with 51 these factors seen as significant: (1) num ber of dum p pits and elevator legs, (2) ease of directing grain am ong storage units, (3) testing equipm ent expense, (4) increased labor, (5) m anagem ent-paperwork required and dispute settlem ents, (6) testing tim e (queuing), and (7) lost prem iums. Literature on Segregation An im portant subject related to the SKU problem is that of increased segregations of grains. Research in this area com es mostly from the Canadian grain handling system and supports m y research by finding that increased grain segregations do increase costs on the grain-m arketing system . Wheeler (1998) identified m any variables that are relevant to the higher costs associated with increased grain segregations. He found that the num ber of segregations impacts grain transportation, handling, and m arketing and that storage capacity, turnover ratios, and logistics are im portant factors cont ributing to the costs of segregating grains. Wheeler (1998) identified that the num ber of wheat segregations received at west coast Canadian ports increased from 81 in 1992 to 112 by 1996. He also reports that only 43 segregations were actually shipped from west coast elevators in 1996. Increased congestion at logistical points is a concern due to the loss in efficiency, which adds expenses to the m arketing of grain. W heeler (1998) states that each additional segregation results in dim inishing m arginal returns and increasing m arginal costs. Askin (1988) has perform ed research in this area as well. He found that a ten percent rise in the turnover rate at a prim ary elevator results in a six percent reduction in average total costs. Askin (1988) used an econom etric m odel to estim ate the relationship between costs and elevator variables. He also found that adding 2 grades to system receipts 52 increases average operating costs by 5 cents per tonne and average total costs by 13 cents per tonne. McKeague et al. (1987) studied the eff ect that a num ber of factors, including unloading and grading, weighing, cleaning, st orage, and shipping, have on operational efficiency. Their research showed that the num ber of storage bins is critical to efficient operations. McKeague et al. (1987) also found that dem urrage charges m ay increase when small parcels of grain are introduced into the term inal elevator due to the tim e required to build up adequate stocks for shipping volum es. McPhee and Bourget (1995) also exam ined the costs associated with an increasing number of grain segregations. Models were form ulated to determ ine the relationship between the num ber of grains and grades handled, and operating costs in the Canadian terminal elevator handling system . The Canadian Grain Com mission (CGC) is also intrigued by this problem of increasing grades and grain segregations. McPhee and Bourget (1995) studied this problem for the CGC and found that a 10% increase in the number of grades handled increased average operating costs by 2.57%. McPhee and Bourget (1995) report an increase in the num ber of grades handled at the Vancouver export terminal would cause a significant increase in average operating costs. This conclusion was obtained from their regression analysis regarding their average operating cost m odel. Literature on Identity Preservation Wilson and Dahl (2000a) exam ined the costs associated with m arketing wheat on an identity-preserved basis. A survey used by the authors found that wheat is being segregated on the basis of grade, protein, and location. One survey respondent noted that the cost of identity preservation m ay range f rom 25 to 50 cents per bushel. The authors 53 also found that an increase in m arket segm entation am ong im porters of United States hard wheat is occurring. The literature review in this paper included estim ates on identity-preservation costs and also pointed out m ajor factors to consider f or implem enting an identity-preservation program . Managem ent and tim e lim itations were listed as im portant factors to consider for implem enting an identity-preservation plan. Additional costs to identity preservation system s include testing, tim e requirem ents, lot turnover, dispute settlem ents, and facility modifications. Three separate cost functions were developed by the researchers, including the farm er, grain handler, and processor. The m ajor costs associated and included in the m odel with respect to identity preservation are testing and storage requirem ents. Another important area of consideration is labeled as quality costs that represent both econom ic and cash costs. These costs include rejected lots that m eet the required specifications and are rejected and also include the opportunity or econom ic cost of giving away a higher quality of grain, that is, grain that possesses quality traits above those specified. A major conclusion of the research is that increased specificity in strategies has the most im pact on the change in shipper costs. As econom ic costs increase, segregation occurs to reduce these higher econom ic costs. Brester et al. (1996) exam ine the costs associated with identity preservation in wheat. A m ain focus of the research is labeled as the principal agent problem . The principal agent problem is the idea that buyers are unable to know im mediately if the product delivered conform s to their specified needs. Tests and sam ples m ust be conducted to ensure that the product m eets their quality requirem ents. If the product does not 54 conform , it is sold on a scrap m arket at a lower price. Managem ent costs are considered important due to the com plexity that identity preservation presents to adm inistration. The Econom ic Research Service (ERS) estim ates the cost of segregation for the grain pipeline at 22 to 54 cents per bushel (ERS, 2000). Segregation costs included in the research are additional costs of storage, handling, risk m anagem ent, analysis/testing, and marketing. The ERS estim ate is based on a University of Illinois survey about specialty grain handling. The ERS exam ines a pipeline consisting of a country elevator, sub- terminal, and export elevator. The results show that costs increased at all three points in the supply chain when the num ber of segregations rose. The cost estim ate for segregating non-GM corn is 22 cents per bushel and for soybeans is 54 cents per bushel. Assum ptions in the m odel for the cost estim ations include (1) risk m anagem ent cost is not greater than for high oil corn, (2) a two-tier segregation is needed to safeguard against com mingling, and (3) a m ultiple trait protein test kit is introduced to detect biotech content for the Round- up Ready and Liberty Link corn varieties. Costs are added across the two-tier m arketing system , which include testing, risk m anagem ent, m arketing, and storage expenses. Summary of Segregation and Identity Preservation Studies Many researchers have exam ined the various costs of segregation and identity preservation. Table 2.1 provides a sum mary of past analysis regarding the estim ated costs of segregation and identity preservation. 55 Table 2.1.

The current grain-m arketing system uses tests to determ ine grade characteristics, protein content, dockage, and other characteristics for a grain lot. Since the introduction of genetically m odified crops and consum er concerns over these food inputs, genetic testing must also be added. Consum er preferences drive the dem and for testing. Testing assures the buyers and end-users that the supplier is achieving their specified preferences. Harl adds that zero tolerance by buyers on specifications would require testing at every point in the m arketing channel where grain is com mingled (Anderson, 1999a). Accuracy, tim e requirem ents, and cost are crucial elem ents in testing. The National Grain and Feed Association (1999) states that tests should be accurate, repeatable, low cost, 56 and applicable to future releases of GM grains and oilseeds. Testing for genetically altered commodities is needed because genetically m odified seeds do not look visually different from their conventional counterparts. It is difficult to determ ine m any of the quality attributes of a grain lot by visual inspection m ethods, so m ore com plex tests are needed. Harl (1999) states that testing is necessary wh en genetically m odified grains are added to the m arketing system . He adds that a two-track m arketing system would be ideal, one channel for genetically m odified hybrids and one track for non-genetically m odified varieties. In the past, tests were used to determ ine the quality content of a grain sam ple. Many tests are available f or the analysis of different quality f actors, and they have a wide range in accuracy, cost, and tim e factors. In addition to quality tests, genetic testing is now used to determ ine the am ount of genetic m aterial present in a sam ple. Tim e is an im portant factor when loading or unloading lots of grai n as costs are associated with waiting for the test results. If a m arket-applicable test cannot be developed for genetic content identification, pre-testing at producer's fields or storage facilities m ay occur before delivery to the country elevator as a safeguard in preventing contam ination and ensuring conform ance to the required genetic specifications. The constraint on tim e requirem ents is important during the peak harvest season at elevators. Extra labor at the elevator and wait time for producers are im portant expenses in addition to the cost of the test. There is no single, rapid, or inexpensive test to verify whether a crop is free of genetic m odification (Magin et al., n.d.). The National Grain and Feed Association (1999) states that, if a single test capable of de tecting the full range of biotechnology enhanced traits cannot be developed, perhaps m arker genes that can be detected by a single test 57 should be inserted into genetically altered crops. Testing procedures currently vary by commodity. Soybeans are relatively easy to test since only one variety, glyphosate- resistance, has been grown; however, 16 different transf ormations exist in corn (Bullock et al., 2000). Genetic Tests Genetically enhanced testing accuracy has great uncertainty. A lack of confidence in these tests is due not only to the test, but also to the sam pling m ethods used to obtain a representation of the lot. A 1998 ring trial by the Joint Research Center of the European Union found that 44% of detection laborator ies could not com plete a dioxybliec nucleic acid (DNA) analysis of genetically enhanced foods (Genetic-ID, 2000c). There is uncertainty in the accuracy of genetic tests and the degree of m odification a test can detect. Tests m ay not be able to identify every m odification on the m arket, which leads to false negatives. One m ust also rem ember that tests only report on the sam ple extracted from an entire lot. Genetic tests currently available include Polym erase Chain Reaction (PCR), southern blot analysis, im munoassay, and herbicide bioassay tests. In addition, a near- infrared (NIR) test is in developm ent. Hu rburgh et al. (n.d.) report that NIR results on Round-up Ready soybeans could be obtained in about 1 m inute with an estim ated cost of only $3 to $5. The test is believed to be over 90% accurate on lots that are all Round-up Ready or non-Round-up Ready. There are two general categories of genetic tests. These classifications include DNA and im munoassay tests. DNA tests, like the Polym erase Chain Reaction (PCR), are used by law enforcem ent agencies to identify suspects with virtual certainty. Im munoassay 58 tests are used to determ ine genetic m odifications and are also used in the m edical field and home pregnancy tests. Quantitative results are not easily achieved with any test. However, if a tolerance level is adopted for labeling laws, quantitative results are necessary. Each test has positive and negative factors that need to be considered when choosing a testing technique. DNA Grain Tests Polym erase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests are widely used in Europe and the United States to determ ine if a com modity contains genetically m odified m aterials. The m ain benefit of PCR is that it is able to detect all genetic m odifications in one test (Schuff, 1999). All genetic m odifications can be found us ing PCR tests because this type of test searches for altered dioxybliec nucleic acid (DNA) rather than proteins. PCR tests m ay produce higher accuracy ratings because DNA m odifications are shown in all parts of the plant, whereas proteins are only expressed in cer tain sections of a plant (Gachet et al., n.d.). PCR tests are also able to give quantitative results in percentages rather than a yes/no answer. The negative aspects of PCR are the tim e required to check a sam ple, and the complexity and cost of the laboratory work. PCR's high sensitivity along with very low levels of adventitious com mingling can also result in false positives (Magin et al., n.d.). A false positive result m eans that the sam ple may actually m eet the requirem ents for being classified as non-GM, but the sensitivity of the test returns a result stating that the sam ple contains too m uch genetic m aterial. PCR tests can be com pleted within 24 to 36 hours, however, the tim e requirem ent is generally 3 days. PCR testing requires specialized laboratory equipm ent, and skilled personnel are needed to perform the tests. PCR test costs 59 range from $100 to $300 per sam ple, and typically, 1 day is required for sam ple analysis with results generally available within 1 to 3 days (Magin et al., n.d.). Southern blot testing is a m ethod used to determ ine if a com modity has been genetically m odified by detecting specific DNA sequences. It costs $100 to $300 per sample and takes 4 to 6 days to obtain results (Klose and Speich, 1999). Klose and Speich (1999) add that the test process is difficult to adm inister and that it requires special equipm ent and training, including radioactive m aterial. Since this type of test is not very user friendly, the southern blot test is generally not used for detecting genetic m aterial in grains. Protein Tests Proteins are expressed as a result of a genetic m odification and are identified by the antibodies used in the im munoassay strip test. Im munoassay tests exhibit beneficial characteristics that the PCR lacks. They generally do not require an extensive am ount of time to obtain a quantitative or yes/no result, are less expensive, and are easier to use. Biotechnology com panies often use them to m ake sure that the gene in question was actually inserted in a plant (Genetic-ID, 2000b). Im munoassay tests include Enzym e Linked Im munosorbent Assay (ELISA) tests, Late ral-flow strip tests, and Multi-trait strip tests. An ELISA test is a com plex im munoassay test that can provide quantitative test results. An ELISA test can only identify one genetic m odification per test. ELISA tests are able to detect and m easure the protein of interest in a sam ple using antibodies specific to those proteins (Magin et al., n.d.). The am ount of protein present or the percentage of genetic m aterial can be com pared against a known sam ple to determ ine a quantitative 60 result. A benef it of the ELISA test is that it is less susceptible to f alse positives caused by inadvertent contam ination. Another advantage of ELISA tests is that the sam ple cost per test is less than for the PCR tests. The ELISA test takes at least six hours to com plete (Bullock et al., 2000). The ELISA test that quantifies the genetic content in herbicide- resistant soybeans costs $100 per test, whereas the PCR test costs $295 per test (Bullock et al., 2000). A negative point of the ELISA test is that not all genetically m odified varieties exhibit proteins at a detectable level. Al so, the developm ent and generation of antibodies that are used to identify the genetic m odification are tim ely and expensive. Strip tests are quick and are less expensive than ELISA tests. Most strip tests are only able to detect one genetic m odification. A separate test m ust be conducted for each implanted gene that m ay occur, however, new strip tests are in developm ent to detect m ore than one event per test. Strip tests give a yes or no answer to the presence of the genetic material in question and are easy to adm inister. Lateral-flow strip test analysis takes between five to fifteen m inutes per test, and the test is relatively inexpensive (Bullock et al., 2000). Strip tests cost roughly $7.50 per test for soybeans and $7.00 per test for corn (Bullock et al., 2000). Multi-trait strip tests are in developm ent and could potentially detect more than one event per strip per test. In fact, Strategic Diagnostics, Inc. (SDI) (n.d.) has developed a Multi-trait strip test that is able to detect up to six events in one strip (SDI). Herbicide bioassay tests are used to check sam ples for resistance to herbicides. A sample of seeds is sprayed with the herbicide in question to determ ine resistance. If the seedlings live, they are considered genetically m odified, and if they do not live, the sam ple is determ ined to be non-genetically m odified. This test allows for quantification but takes 61 time to com plete as germ ination m ust occur. This test costs $30 and works only on seeds that germ inate (Bullock et al., 2000). Government Role in Testing The Grain Inspection Packers and Stockyard Adm inistration (GIPSA) is the governm ent agency that oversees grain testing. GIPSA has evolved from the first United Grain Standards Act, which was established in 1916 to facilitate the trading of grain in a timely and orderly m anner. In 1976, the Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) was established to regulate the grain inspection and weighing system , and GIPSA was form ed in 1994 by the m erger of FGIS and the Packers and Stockyards Adm inistration (US W heat Associates, n.d.). GIPSA is the agency that m ust accredit laboratories and testing m ethods. The accreditation process involves different testing techniques and procedures to determ ine accuracy ratings. Testing Im pact on Logistics Testing strategies are related to the logistical flow of grains. Tim ing is an essential factor for logistics planning. As described in the previous section of Genetic Tests, tests require different lengths of tim e to determ ine a result. The num ber of tests and the point of testing also im pact the logistical m ovem ent of the grain. Testing m ay result in a bottleneck at the supply chain node where it occurs, leading to delays in the grain pipeline. The m ajor obstacles of logistics planning are to get a pr oduct from one point to another point at the right tim e and to ensure that the product delivered m eets the specifications of the product requested. Adding another function or activity, such as testing, to this already com plex network increases the logistical dif ficulties of moving grain. 62 A major cost associated with testing is that of queuing tim e or waiting. These expenses could be classified as opportunity cost s for the deliverer of the grain product. In addition, a carry cost or opportunity cost is incurred over the num ber of days the grain m ust be held while a test occurs and results are received. A strategy to avoid this cost is to send the shipm ent of grain while the test is being conducted and hope that it will conform to the quality requirem ents. There is a risk with this m ethod, which is having the shipm ent being out of conform ance to m eet the specified dem and at the destination point. If the product fails to conform to the required specifications, the shipm ent may have to be reconsigned or diverted to an alternative area where there is a dem and for this non-conform ing product. Another m ethod is to perform the test once the shipm ent arrives. Perform ing a test while a vessel is waiting to unload m ay lead to increased dem urrage charges if the test requires a significant am ount of tim e to com plete. The tim eliness and accuracy of testing are im portant factors in determ ining grain- marketing logistics . The definition earlier by Ballou (1999) of having the \"right good\" at the \"right at the \"right tim e\" solidifies the im portance of testing. Sampling Sampling is a crucial factor in the testing procedure. The Grain Inspection Packers and Stockyards Adm inistration (GIPSA) states that sam pling error is often the greatest source of variance in the analytical procedure (GIPSA-TSD, n.d.). The Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) adds that sam pling is an essential part of the inspection process and one that is critical to the accuracy of the final inspection results (FGIS, 1999). A sam ple is a subset of a lot and is assum ed to represent an entire lot of a commodity. A representative lot is difficult to obtain since grain is not hom ogenous. Even 63 if testing m ethods are accurate, they are only correct for the sam ple, which is a sm all percentage of the entire lot. Buyers and sellers are both at risk if representative sam ples are not taken. The num ber of sam ples drawn and the sam ple size have a large im pact on sam ple quality. A com mon sam pling error is not drawing the proper num ber of sam ples. FGIS suggests that at least 2 sam ples should always be taken for lots 600 bushels and under and 3 samples for lots over 600 bushels (FGIS, 1999). Sample size is another im portant elem ent for quality testing. FGIS states that, for most factor determ inations, the larger the portion analyzed, the m ore accurate the results (1999). Genetic-ID (2000c) adds that m ost labs use sam ple sizes far too sm all to provide statistical confidence. Bullock et al. (2000) sa id that test results are im perfect because of small sam ple sizes and physical testing errors. Confidence in the true percentage of genetically m odified seeds present in a lot is dif ficult to obtain due to the variability in sample analysis. Testing for m ycotoxins is unlike protein or m oisture tests. Protein and m oisture are considered to have a uniform distribution within a lot of grain. Sam pling and testing for mycotoxins and genetically m odified content is different in the respect that only a few kernels in an entire lot m ay test positive. W hen only a f ew kernels af fect the outcom e of a test, the characteristic is said to posses a nonuniform distribution. The Grain Inspection Packers and Stockyards Adm inistration-Techni cal Services Division (GIPSA-TSD) (n.d.) states that 90% of the error associated with aflatoxin (m ycotoxin) testing can be attributed to how the original sam ple was obtained due to contam inated kernels not being generally distributed evenly in the lot. Hurburgh (1999) suggests that sam pling error for genetically 64 modified organism s could follow the sam e rules as m ycotoxins because individual kernels are im portant factors in testing for these characteristics. False positives and negatives are risks associated with sam pling. There is always a chance that good lots could be rejected and bad lots accepted due to sam pling and testing error. This chance can be decreased with an increase in the sam ple size. Hurburgh (1999) suggests that a representative sam ple should be five to ten pounds and taken from several different locations of the lot, ground, m ixed, and divided into portions for analysis. Grinding and dividing large sam ples will help to avoid an unrepresentative sam ple, however, these actions increase the effort and the tim e required to obtain a test result (Hurburgh, 1999). Sampling Methods A sam pling m ethod often used in business and m anufacturing is called acceptance sampling. Acceptance sam pling is used to determ ine the quality of products after production has been com pleted. A sam pling plan that provides 100% inspection or no inspection of finished products can be im plem ented. If every unit is inspected or tested, the expenses associated with analyzing every item becom e very high. Inspecting every railcar or every bushel of grain would be im practical and expensive. If an inspection m ethod is not im plem ented, there is a risk that the product will not m eet the criteria that are desired. Sampling provides a m edium between these extrem es. Sam pling can occur in a variety of ways. Nahm ias (1997) lists three m ethods of acceptance sam pling: single, double, and sequential sam pling. The m ost popular sam pling plan is to take a single sam ple. A sam ple is taken from an entire lot and inspected. The fate of the lot is dependent on the result of the test from 65 this one sam ple unit. Doubling sam pling is an extension of single sam pling. In double sampling, high and low threshold lim its are predeterm ined. If the num ber of defectives is less than a determ ined am ount, the lot is accepted based on the sam ple. If the num ber of defectives is m ore than a certain am ount, the lot is rejected. The advantage of double sampling is that it provides a saf eguard against f alse positives or f alse negatives. Another method is continuous double sam pling, which is term ed sequential sam pling. Nahm ias (1997) states that options in sequential sam pling include accept, reject, or continue sam pling. Guidelines or threshold lim its are predeterm ined for a cum ulative amount of defective or non-defective products in the lot. After each sam ple, the num ber of items sampled is recorded, and the sum of defectives is observed. If the num ber of cumulative sam ples crosses the reject line, the lot is rejected, or if it crosses the lower line, the lot is accepted. If the cum ulative num ber of defects does not cross a line, sam pling continues until a line is reached (Nahm ias, 1997). Sampling is a very im portant factor for test accuracy. Obtaining a representative sample is very difficult, and there are m any risks involved when a sam pling plan is implem ented. The trade-off with sam pling is that inspection costs are decreased from a 100% inspection plan and quality is increased if no inspection plan is in place. In any sampling plan, there is uncertainty in the form of risk that needs to be taken into account. A goal of a sam pling plan is to m anage buyer and seller risk by obtaining a representative sample of the entire lot. A true percentage of content in a lot cannot be determ ined with 100% confidence when sam pling is im plem ented to m easure a threshold or content level. A strong assum ption in sam pling is that the entire lot is representative of the sam ple taken. 66 Certification Certification program s are an alternative for grain handlers to ensure adequate quality levels and genetic threshold levels. Certification involves tracking and docum enting entire product lines in the production chain from farm s to retail shelves, including sam pling, testing, and inspection, and is expected to cost the user about $150,000 per year (Lo, 2000). A third party m onitors and is responsible for inspection, testing, and verification during seed selection, planting, ha rvesting, transportation, storage, distribution, and processing (Argyle Rowland W orldwide, 1999). Certification allows for all stages of the food chain, including farm ers, processors, exporters, shippers, m anufacturers, and retailers, to m aintain the purity of their non-genetically m odified products. By using a certification program such as CERT-ID, a food producer gains the security of an independent non-GMO guarantee, assuring custom ers that the production process has been adequately segregated and inspected, that representative sam ples have been taken and tested, and that sufficient records have been kept to trace all finished products back to the raw m aterials used to produce them (Genetic-ID, 2000a). Exam ples of current certification program s include Cert-ID by the com pany Genetic-ID and Northland Program s. Cert-ID ensures that com modities or foods will remain non-genetically m odified from planting to the finished product (Poulter, 1999). Northland uses a three-step process including pr e-planting in which seed purity is verified. The next phase is called the growing phase in which inspection and testing are implem ented to guarantee that the varieties being grown do not contain undesired genetic material. In the post harvest phase, product segregation is m onitored in the storage and transportation system s, including processing and packaging. More testing is com pleted to 67 ensure that the com modity is free of genetic enhancem ents, and sam ples are m aintained for future analysis (Northland Seed and Grain Corporation, 1999). Certification provides security and assurance to custom ers that the production process has been adequately segregated and inspected, that representative sam ples have been taken and tested, and that sufficient records have been kept to trace all finished products back to the raw m aterials used to produce them (Genetic-ID, 2000a). Certification transfers the risk or liability from the producer to a third party certification agent. Certification m ay be the best selection in high-risk scenarios, those in which low tolerance levels are set. The advantage of certification is that detailed records and adequate testing are im plem ented to ensure that a shipm ent meets the required specifications, whether it is for genetically m odified content or grade characteristics. Adventitious Commingling Effect on Segregation, Identity Preservation, and Testing Many reports have been published regarding adventitious com mingling ef fects in the grain-m arketing system . Hurburgh (1999) states that there are 20 to 30 points where mixing could occur. The Am erican Corn Growers and Genetic-ID, a genetic testing company, indicate that the following five m easures should ensure adequate segregation: (1) clean harvesting equipm ent and storage f acilities; (2) store and ship grain in cleaned, separate containers; (3) provide an adequate buffer between non-genetically m odified and genetically m odified fields f or cross pollinating crops; (4) if genetically enhanced varieties were planted in the current year, rotate to another crop for the next two years and three for canola to prevent adventitious com mingling f rom volunteer genetically engineered plants 68 and; (5) take careful and representative sam ples whenever genetic testing is done (Goldberg and Sm ith, 1999). The f irst area where adventitious com mingling occurs is at planting tim e. Producers need assurance that the seeds they planted were not derived from a genetically altered source. One hundred percent GM free products are not a possibility because seed companies cannot ensure 100% seed purity. Bullock et al. (2000) state that no seed company guarantees 100% seed purity. Soybeans have higher seed purity levels because they are self-pollinated. Seed purity for soybeans range from 99.8% to 99.9% (Bullock et al., 2000). Since corn is cross-pollinated, a lower purity level is com mon, and on average, corn seed is at least 99% of the variety on the label (Bullock et al., 2000). Many crops in Europe have been destroyed due to GM m aterials that have been found in fields believed to be non-GM. Genetic-ID found that 10% of sam ples tested in its laboratories that were believed to be non-GM contained GM m aterial between the levels of 0.1% to 1% (Goldberg and Sm ith, 1999). Midi Libre reported that, in Decem ber 1999, French sources found that 45% of corn designated as non- GMO contained 0.1% or m ore DNA fragm ents from GMO hybrids (Hurburgh, 1999). In Germ any, 82 food products were tested, and one- third were found to contain GMOs, but only 3 products contained GMO content in excess of the 1% threshold level required for labeling (Orpet, 2000). Com mingling m eans that com modities are interm ixed and have not been properly segregated. Value to a crop m ay be lost when this occurs. For grains, adventitious commingling is detrim ental because it is virtually im possible to visually distinguish genetic content differences in grains. Storage, handling, and transportation equipm ent needs to be thoroughly cleaned to ensure that com mingling does not occur. The USDA states that 69 grain m oves through a well-developed transporta tion system , and before a bushel of grain reaches the m arket, it has often been transported by two or m ore modes of transportation (\"Transportation of U.S. Grains,\" n.d.). The chance of grain being com mingled from improper cleaning increases when m ore than one m ode of transportation is used. Com mingling/contam ination also increases when less inform ation is known about the grain in the pipeline. Less handling at interm ediate points in the supply chain can increase ef ficiency and decrease the chance of adventitious com mingling as grain m oves through the network. In addition, vertical integration, or a closed m arketing system , is better suited to avoid com mingling. Vertically integrated, or closed loop, system s foster inform ation sharing, which is a necessity when keeping track of the products being m oved through the logistical pipeline. It is im portant for the vertically integrated system to work together as the beginning points of the pipeline and the end of the pipeline are connected and share in the profits of the product. In an open system , the participant that sells the grain at the beginning stages of the pipeline m ay not care what happens at the next step in the pipeline, as long as a paym ent is m ade for the delivery into the system . Asym metric inform ation in an open system may result in lower accountability of delivery statem ents if there is a significant price difference. Review of Testing and Inspection Studies Larson (1989) has com pleted extensive research on inspection costs with respect to an econom ic order quantity. He exam ined three alternatives in regards to inspection, including no inspection, sam pling, and 100% inspection. In addition to these alternatives, there is also a consideration of what to do with the defective item s. Larson offers three options: scrapping the item , reworking the item so it is not defective, or allowing the 70 defective item s to pass forward. He found that , as the num ber of defects increase in the system , total quantities needed and total costs f or the system increase. Summary The topics discussed in this chapter are factors that are im portant in the logistical analysis of grain m arketing. Most relevant to this research are the concepts of increasing segregations or categories of grains and testing. Past research in the business sector has shown that increasing the num ber of segregations also increases the logistical costs of marketing a product (SKU problem ). Studies of the Canadian grain-m arketing system also confirm this belief. Testing needs to be im plem ented to provide inform ation that an acceptable quality level has been attained. Testing at different points in the supply chain assures that the product, from origin to destination, m eets the requirem ents set forth at the destination. Sampling theory is presented in this chapter but is beyond the scope of the analysis. Testing is the m ain issue introduced in the supply chain m odel with respect to quality. The inform ation presented on segregation, identity preservation, and SKUs provides the motivation that these topics are a subject of interest. Using logistical strategies to m odel the costs of the new grain-m arketing system is a problem that has been studied and needs to be researched further. The studies identified in this thesis lay the foundation for further research in the areas of increasing grain segregations, identity preservation, and grain quality conform ance. The addition of genetically m odified organism s has heightened an interest in these areas. Identity preservation and segregation are old concepts with a renewed interest. 71 The research com pleted on SKUs is all very new and is likely to be an area of continued research to determ ine how an increase or decrease in products or categories affect profits and costs. The research reported in this thesis differs from past studies in several ways. Many of the past logistical studies have not incl uded testing strategies as a com ponent for the entire grain supply chain. Previous logistical reports have focused on bulk com modities with no distinction f or quality characteristics. Other studies have f ocused on just one point in the supply chain instead of an entire pipeline. This research evaluates how costs are affected between three nodes in a supply chain. There is a distinction between this study and identity-preservation studies as well. This study uses the bulk m arketing system with a testing com ponent. The grains are not traceable, but they are separated at testing points depending on the test result. Separating grains based on tests instead of using strict identity preservation is a m ain distinction between this research and identity-preservation studies. 72 CHAPTER 3 THEORETICAL MODEL Introduction Logistical strategies are rising in im portance in the grain-m arketing system . Managing logistical uncertainties in the grain-m arketing industry has becom e a topic of increasing significance. \"Logistics\" has becom e a buzzword in m any industries and is also important in the grain industry. Several studies have exam ined the relationship between logistics and grain m arketing. The rising num ber of quality segregations dem anded by purchasers of grain has an im portant im pact on the logistical system . This chapter explores ideas on how to m odel the logistics of a grain-m arketing system . Testing and sam pling techniques affect the l ogistical flow of grain. Testing and sampling inform ation is vital to the new m arketing system . Testing and sam pling m ust be implem ented due to the com plexity that quality categories and genetically m odified organism s (GMOs) have brought to the bulk m arketing system . The increase in the num ber of segregations, i.e., stock-keeping unit (SKU) problem , adds com plications to the logistical system , which m ust include som e form of identity preservation, or segregation, and quality control. In this chapter, logistical m odels are analyzed first. Second, the effects of the increase in segregations through increasing SKUs are shown. Next, testing, sam pling, and inspection ideas are presented. Finally, a theoretical m odel is derived. This m odel is a cost function which is inclusive of logistical costs. 73 Logistical Models A variety of logistical techniques are possi ble to m odel the flow of a product. The overall goals of logistics are (1) cost reduction, (2) capital reduction, and (3) custom er service im provem ents (Ballou, 1999). Modal selection is an exam ple of a cost-reduction strategy in grain m arketing (Carlson, 1998). Different transportation m odes include rail, barge, and truck. These m odes vary in m any attributes, including cost, transit tim es, and lead-tim es. Carlson (1998) also states that capital investm ents in the grain industry are intensive. Minim izing capital investm ents m ay increase overall profits although operating costs m ay rise f rom lower levels of capital investm ents. Custom er service includes quality attributes and m ay even take account of transportation services due to the nature of different lead-tim es that various transportation m odes present to a grain shipper. Past studies have used econom ic order quantity (EOQ) and m aterial requirem (MRP) approaches. The EOQ m odel m inimizes the total annual costs for purchase, order, and holding costs (Larson, 1989). EOQ is used to find an optim al order quantity by evaluating the trade-of f between order costs and holding costs. The EOQ model is represented by the following equation: Q = (2DS/IC)1/2, where Q = Optim al order quantity or lot size D = Annual dem and for the item S = Procurem ent cost or order cost I = Carrying cost as a percentage of the item s value C = Value of the item carried in inventory 74 Results f rom EOQ m odels provide a determ ination of an optim al order quantity that minimizes cost. The equation is the first derivative of a specified cost function, which includes procurem ent cost and inventory carrying costs. The optim al order quantity exists when the two costs are in balance and the m inimal total cost results (Ballou, 1999). Just in tim e techniques (JIT) have been increasingly adapted to Am erican business practices. The idea behind JIT system s is to synchronize the entire supply channel to respond to the requirem ents of operations or custom ers (Ballou, 1999). Inventory costs are reduced due to the benefits of the system , including (1) suppliers located closer to the manufacturer, (2) reduced lead-tim es, and (3) quality im provem ents due to less variability. Requirem ents planning has been adapted for logistics. Materials requirem ent planning (MRP) is prim arily used for scheduling high-value custom -made parts, m aterials, and supplies when dem and is reasonably well known (Ballou, 1999). Ballou states that precise tim ing of m aterial flows to m eet production requirem ents is the principle behind MRP (1999). MRP m echanics are defined as a form al, m echanical m ethod of supply scheduling whereby the tim ing of purchases or of production output is synchronized to meet period-by-period operating requirem ents by offsetting the request for supply from the requirem ents by the length of the lead-tim e (Ballou, 1999). Figure 3.1 illustrates a sim ple MRP com putation from Ballou.

Source: Ballou (1999). 75 In this exam ple, beginning inventory consists of 400 units. There is a lead-tim e of two weeks from production to delivery. The lengt h of the lead-tim e controls the flow of materials. Algebraically the m odel is form ulated as Dt = F(Inv t, Rec t, Production t-n, n), where D t = Dem and in period t Inv t = Inventory on hand in period t Rec t = Receipts delivered in period t Production t-n = Production released two periods beforehand where R ect = Production t-n n = Lead-tim e from production facility to receipts at the point of dem and. MRP m odels are flow or system s approach m odels that are used to pull m aterials through the logistical pipeline as their need is forecast. Inventory is an integral com ponent of MRP m odels that accounts for uncertainty in the logistical pipeline. A m ajor com ponent of uncertainty in MRP m odels is dem and. Forecasts of dem and are calculated in the MRP fram ework, which m eans that dem and is not known with certainty. Another area of risk is the assum ption that lead-tim es are constant in MRP m ethodology. Transit tim es are not always certain, and the assum ption of constant lead-tim es is a drawback for the MRP approach. MRP is beneficial in the aspect that it brings the tim ing of flows into consideration for m anaging a grain-m arketing plan. 76 Logistics Models: Previous Applications in Grain Carlson (1998) used a m aterial requirem ents planning (MRP) m odel to illustrate the costs of grain m oving through a pipeline. The m odel evaluated the m ovem ent of grain from an inland term inal with the ability to transport grains by rail or barge to an export facility in the Gulf region. The m odel is specified and evaluated using stochastic simulation. The m ajor stochastic factors included in the m odel are dem and, transit tim e for rail and barge, vessel arrivals, and grain unloads at port term inals. A major focus of Carlson's research is on estim ating dem urrage charges. Dem urrage is a concept used by firm s to increase logistical efficiency. Dem urrage is a cost charged to a shipper when a defined period of tim e for loading or unloading has surpassed. For exam ple, if one is given two days to load a train and it takes three days, one day of demurrage charges would be applied. Railroads, barges, and ocean vessel firm s use demurrage concepts to increase efficiency am ong their users. The equation to calculate demurrage is D emC = Dem RDem Qt, where Dem C = Dem urrage cost Dem R = Dem urrage rate in $/unit/week Dem Qt = Quantity in units of volum e in week (t) that are delayed Carlson (1998) derived the following equation to define total costs of the system : TC = (RTQR t + RCQC t + BR QB t + Dem T QTL t + Dem EQEL t + Dem BQBL t + Dem VQVL t + Int RInv t), where TC = Total cost of system 77 RT = Rail tariff QR t = Quantity of rail tarif f cars arriving in week t RC = COT prem iums QC t = Quantity of COT cars arriving in week t BR = Barge Rate QB t = Quantity of barges arriving in week t Dem T = Rail dem urrage rate at the term inal elevator QTL t = Num ber of trains delayed at the term inal elevator Dem E = Rail dem urrage rate at the export elevator QEL t = Num ber of trains delayed at the export elevator Dem B = Dem urrage rate for barges QBL t = Quantity of barges delayed at term inal and export locations Dem V = Dem urrage rate for vessels QVL t = Quantity of vessels delayed at export term inal Int R = Interest rate on short term capital Inv t = Value of grain stocks in the m arketing channel, including inventory at term inal and export locations and grain in transit for week t Wilson and Dahl (2000b) analyzed the logistical strategies and risks of m arketing grain in the Canadian grain system . The goal of the research was to analyze logistical risks and trade-of fs, quantif y dem urrage costs, and evaluate the ef fects of critical variables on the logistical system . Material requirem ents planning (MRP) is used as a foundation for the m odel. A dynam ic stochastic fram ework is used to capture the highly variable nature of many critical factors. Wilson and Dahl (2000b) derived this equation to show how profits are affected by different logistical factors: = (SalesQ tPt + DesRDesP tDesQ t - Qt), subject to S alesQt Gt and SalesQ t > t, where = Returns to the pool Sales Q t = Quantity in tonnes of grain sold for shipm ent in week t 78 P t = Sales price ($/tonne) in week t DesR = Despatch rate in $/tonne/week (set at half of Dem R) DesQ t = Quantity in tonnes arriving and loaded in week t DesP t = Percentage of the week despatch is applied: (7 days m inus average load tim e in days)/7 IntR = Interest rate per week Inv t = Current value of the quantity of grain held in inventory in week t Dem R = Dem urrage rate in $/tonne/week Dem Qt = Quantity in tonnes of ship volum e in week t that is held in port beyond the week it arrived G t = Guidelines t = Minim um level of weekly shipm ents = Scalar Sales are constrained to be less than or equal to Gt and greater than t. When the model is solved, an optim al num ber of sales for each week and Vachal (2000) determ ined logi for different transportation modes on a soybean shipm ent originating in Iowa and destined for Japan. The m odes analyzed include container, truck, single car train, and unit train. Total costs are determ ined by the following equation: Total Costs = Storage Cost + Handling Cost + Transport Cost + Marketing Cost Specific costs analyzed include (1) farm storage, (2) inland elevator storage, (3) farm handling, (4) inland elevator handling, (5) port term inal handling, (6) haul to farm , (7) haul to elevator, (8) inland drayage, (9) inland truc k freight, (10) inland rail, (11) ocean freight, (12) inland/ocean freight, and (13) m arketing costs. 79 The studies that were reviewed provide m athem atical definitions for an evaluation of logistical costs of m arketing grain for an en tire pipeline. Other past studies have focused on one point in the supply chain and are not included here for that reason. Material requirem ents planning (MRP) is the m ethod that is m ost often applied to grain supply chain m odels. The benefit of MRP m odels is that releases can be scheduled from an inland term inal to the point of dem and. MRP m odeling also allows for the introduction of uncertainties, which allows one to m odel the dynam ic flows of grain through the pipeline. In the MRP fram ework, lead-tim e is considered fixed, and dem and is considered to be known. Stochastic sim ulation can be added to the MRP fram ework to account for the uncertainty in lead-tim e and dem and. Adding uncertainty allows a m anager to develop a m ore viable supply schedule. Segregation and Stock-Keeping Unit Research The stock-keeping unit (SKU) problem is a m ethod of looking at how increased segregations of grain affect grain-m arketing costs. Som e form of testing or inspection becom es necessary to ensure that the segregations are actually different and labeled as such. The following m ethods have been used to determ ine how logistical costs are affected by an increase in segregations. Research on Increased Grain Segregation Costs Using Regression Askin used econom etric analysis to determ ine how operating and total costs are affected by an increase in the num ber of segregations in the Canadian wheat handling system (1988). Factors included in the econom etric m odel were receipts, capacity, num ber 80 of storage bins, num ber of grains and grades received, the percentage of receipts in the top five grades, type of m anager unit, and tur nover. Askin (1988) found that turnover had the largest im pact on costs. He reported that a 10% increase in turnover rate is estim ated to reduce average total costs by around 6%. The num ber of grades received also im pacts costs. Askin found that an increase of 2 grades increased average operating costs by 5 cents per tonne and average total costs by 13 cents per tonne (1988). McPhee and Bourget used an operating cost m odel with the following factors, receipts, num ber of grains and grades receive d, num ber of grades in store, and elevator capacity, to determ ine their relationship to operating costs (1995). The m odel results show that elevator capacity and configuration ar e important factors affecting the costs of handling m ore segregations. In fact, by using regression analysis from their cost m odel, an increase in the num ber of grades handled was shown to cause a significant increase in average operating costs at the Vancouver facilitie s. However, at the Thunder Bay facilities, which have a larger average num ber of bins than the Vancouver term inals, the num ber of grades handled did not seem to have a si gnificant effect. A Canadian Grain Com mission report by McPhee and Bourget (1995) found that a 10% increase in the num ber of grades increases average operating costs for elevators by 2.57%. McPhee and Bourget noted that there is an optim al num ber of grades that m aximize turnover rate. At low num bers of grades, additional grades are positively associated with increased turnover while, at high numbers of grades, turnover is negatively associated with additional grades (McPhee and Bourget, 1995). Wheeler states that additional segregations raise costs due to increased storage and handling of segregations that arise from the need for additional storage and reduced 81 handling efficiency as well as additional m anagem ent costs (1998). In his report, he exam ines the im portance of storage configurations and the num ber of bins. W heeler (1998) adds that an increase in segregations brings m ore com plexity to the transportation system . It is possible that the wrong segregation could be m oved at the wrong tim e and that increased segregations m ay require greater switching of rail cars, reducing the railroads efficiency (W heeler, 1998). Every study that W heeler reviews in his paper concludes that m ore grain segregations increase expenses in the grain-m arketing system . Wheeler (1998) provides a summary of m any studies com pleted in respect to this problem in the Canadian system . The paper is im portant to this research as it provides insight about why logistical costs rise when the num ber of segregations increase. Stock-Keeping Unit Research A case study on stock-keeping units (SKUs) by Handfield and Nichols (1999) provides relevant inform ation on how SKUs affect total costs for a firm . The cost equation derived includes variables across various inventory strategies that im pact financial perform ance. Inventory strategies include how m any SKUs should be stocked and the optim al stocking quantity for each SKU. In the case study, if SKUs are not stocked, the item can be shipped directly to the custom er at a higher freight cost. The equation does not include overhead costs due to these expenses being unaffected by the inventory strategy. The following equation is used to determ ine the im pact that increased SKUs have on operating incom e: OI = (R-C) (QIS+O sp) - H(Inv) - C(Inv) - S 1(QIS) - S 2 (O sp), 82 where OI = Operating incom e R = Revenue per item (average) C = Cost per pair to m anufacture or purchase the item (average) QIS = Stocked SKU sales Osp = Special orders of SKUs not stocked H = Holding cost per item per year (including obsolescence) Inv = Average inventory S1 = Regular shipping cost S2 = Express shipping cost A sim ulation m odel is used to calculate the operating incom e for various SKU stocking levels. Stochastic variables include whether a SKU is stocked, custom er arrivals, custom er dem and for SKUs, and custom er acceptance of a special order offer. The m odel did not account for SKU substitutability due to the difficult nature of hum an preference on what SKUs are considered adequate substitutes f or a SKU that is currently out of stock. The operating incom e equation assum es that in-store sales and special orders are constant and that there are a fixed num ber of overall stock-keeping units (SKUs). This case study demonstrates the effect of increased SKUs a nd inventory strategies for a shoe store. Figure 3.2, derived from Handfield and Nichol s, provides an illustration on how the SKU stocking percentage affects operating incom e. An increasing num ber of grain categories are present in the m arketing channel. Determ ining how to adapt the bulk transportation and handling system to account for these differentiated products is a challenge that needs to be m et. The factors given for the regression m odels and the m odel for the shoe SKU problem are starting points to determ ine the cost that increased segregations have on the grain-m arketing pipeline. 83 Relationshi p Bet ween SKU St Figure 3.2. Relationship Between Am ount of SKU Stocked and Incom e. Source: Handfield and Nichols (1999). Testing and Sampling Testing and sam pling are used in a logistical system to check f or quality attributes. Quality control is increasing in im portance in the grain-m arketing system . Due to the difficulty of determ ining grain attributes, sp ecialized tests m ust be conducted to quantify these characteristics. Testing is necessary in the case of genetically m odified (GM) organism s because GM grains cannot be visually distinguished from their conventional counterparts. Genetic testing com panies have entered the industry to provide quality testing on grain products. Genetic inspection of grain is necessary to detect for its presence. 84 Larson (1989) has shown the effects that testing and sam pling have on production and ordering. He provides three possible inspection strategies. They include (1) no inspections, (2) 100% inspection, and (3) sam pling. Som e inspection or testing plans are impractical, such as the 100% inspection because it would be very expensive or im possible if it involves destructive testing. In addition, if the consum er must perform the inspection, the results m ay not be objective (Nahm ias, 1997). There are m any different sam pling plans that provide risk sharing between the buyer and the seller of a product. A brief description of various sam pling plans is provided, but sam pling theory is beyond the scope of this research. Single sam pling is the most com monly used m ethod to determ ine grain quality. Single sam pling involves taking a selection from a lot and conducting a single test on this selection to represent the entire lot from which the sam ple was taken. The distribution for the num ber of defectives is hypergeom etric (Nahm ias, 1997). W hen the num ber of item s used in a sam ple is less than the lot size, a binom ial approxim ation to the hypergeom ias, 1997). Binom ial approxim ation allows one to calculate the risks to the consum er and to the producer by using specific equations for each participant. Larson states that sam pling plans are driven by operating characteristic curves (1989). Nahm ias adds that operating characteristic curves m easure the effectiveness of a test to screen lots of varying quality (1997). The operating characteristic curve is the relationship between the probability of acceptance and the expected percent defective (Nahm ias, 1997). The desirable relationship between these factors should be inversely related. The operating characteristic curve illustrates that lots with a sm all percent of defectives should be accepted with a higher probability. 85 Double sam pling and sequential sam pling are other sam pling alternatives. These sampling plans set acceptance and rejection standards, and accum ulate the test results for a number of tests until the cum ulative results of the sam ple intersect the acceptance or rejection thresholds. Double sam pling and sequential sam pling plans are m ore com plex to set up than a single plan. In these plans, two values are determ ined, which are the acceptable or rejectable levels of defectives in the sam ple. For a double sam pling plan, if the first test result is between these levels, another sam ple is drawn. The results f rom this sam ple are compared against a new rejectable lim it. Binom ial approxim ations are used to determ ine the operating characteristic curve for double sam pling plans. Variables included in double sampling plans include the size of the first sam ple and second sam ple, and the acceptable and rejectable lim its. In addition, an acceptable quality level m ust be determ ined. Sequential sam pling plans are extensions of the double sam pling plan. Alternatives in a sequential sam pling plan are to accept the lot, reject the lot, or continue sam pling. Three lim its need to be established that include the rejection area, acceptance area, and the continue sam pling area. Larson (1989) introduces a single sam ple plan that includes an inspection aspect in which rejected lots are sold at their next best alternative or a scrap value. An optim al order quantity is calculated for a given tim e period, a nd total procurem ent costs and average costs are estim ated from this equation. Larson's m odel defines this EOQ form ula as Q = (2SU/hC(1-p)2)1/2 and total costs as 86 TC = U((1-p)C + p(C-w) + i) / (1-p) + US/(1-p)Q + hCQ(1-p)/2, where Q = Econom ic order quantity TC = Total cost of procurem ent S = Cost per order U = Annual dem and h = Storage cost per unit (percent of unit value) C = Cost per unit p = Probability that a unit is def ective w = Salvage value for rejected units i = Interest cost Item \"p\" is im portant in this equation and is defined as the percent of item s defective. The percent of item s defective is sim ilar to the contam ination or adventitious commingling concept discussed earlier and could represent the percent of genetic content found in non-genetically m odified wheat lots. Larson (1989) found that, as the percent of defective item s expected increases, the total costs increase as well. Depending on the quality selection, total costs rise at different rates in relation to the percent defective. Selling item s at a scrap value if they do not pass inspection can be utilized in the grain-m arketing channel. Non-GM wheat lots that do not pass the genetic inspection are placed in the genetic m arketing channel or their next best alternative use. Genetic lots are discounted by a value due to pricing that has evolved in the m arketing system for corn and soybeans. Lots that are found to be genetically m odified are labeled and categorized as such, and non-GM lots rem ain as non-GM lots after inspection has occurred. Wilson and Dahl (2000a) used an econom ic order quantity m odel to determ ine an 87 optim al lot size. A Taguchi Loss function is im plem ented to determ ine the costs of not meeting quality requirem ents. The Taguchi Loss function is (1) a continuous quality loss function and is a m easure of deviation f rom the target value, (2) im plies that quality loss is related to product perform ance characteristics and can be m inimized by designing quality into the product, (3) states that quality loss results from custom er dissatisfaction and should be m easured system wide rather than at a discrete point in the m anufacturing process, and (4) im plies that quality loss is a financial and social loss (W ilson and Dahl, 2000b). The Taguchi Loss value is represented by the following equation: L(X) = k(X-T)2, where L(X) = The value of the loss in quality k = Adjustm ent factor X = Observed param eter T = Target value for the param eter A target level is set, and costs are determ ined if this acceptable level is not m et. If the level is lower than acceptable, a cost of non-conform ity is applied. This non-conform ity cost is similar to what Larson (1989) defines as having to sell the product on the scrap m arket. If the test shows that the target level has been exceeded, an econom ic cost is incurred. The product could have brought an increase in revenue in its best use of filling a higher quality demand. For exam ple, a target protein level of 14% is desired, but the test shows that this sample has a 15% protein level. The difference in price between these two categories is an econom ic cost because one m ust now sell this higher quality protein wheat at the 14% price level. 88 Queuing is an expense associated with testing. W hen tests are conducted, there is a time period between the gathering of the m aterials to test and arriving at the test results. This cost of waiting is often referred to as a queuing cost. It is an im portant cost to consider for farm er deliveries to the elevator and unloadings at the next point where a test occurs. These testing concepts have all been used in past research to aid in determ ining the inspection and the overall costs, or revenues of di fferent logistical strategies. Testing is an important aspect to this research. Differentiated products cannot always be visually distinguished, so scientific testing m ust be im plem ented. The m ost difficult aspect of testing is obtaining a representative sam ple. Many researchers use the assum ption that a sample is norm ally distributed. Summary of Important Variables from Research Com mon variables that are im portant to determ ine the cost of increased grain segregations have been identified from past research. Table 3.1 provides a sum mary of the factors used in past research to determ ine costs. 89 Table 3.1. Important Cost Variables for Increased Segregations Author Cost Variables Reichert and Vachal (2000) Storage , Handling, Transportation, Marketing Askin (1988) Receipts, Capacity, Storage Bins, Categories Received , High Volum e Categories, Managem ent, and Turnover McPhee and Bourget (1995) Receipts, Categories Received, Categories in Store - Elevator Configuration, Elevator Capacity Wheeler (1998) Storage Configurations, Storage Bins, Dem urrage Handfield and Nichols (1999) Invent ory Costs and Manufacturer Costs ERS (2000) Testing, Handling, Storage, and Marketing Costs (Bolded factors were listed as m ost im portant). Research Model Logistical expenses include transportati on, dem urrage, interest costs of inventory, and quality testing. Com ponents from the aforem entioned equations are com bined to derive an equation that captures the logistical costs of a supply chain accom modating differentiated products inclusive of segregation and testing. Forgone prem ium charges that capture the cost of not using a grain category in its best use are inserted to capture substitution activity. Handling costs are assum ed known and constant. Queuing costs are not included due to a lack of inform ation about test tim e requirem ents and constraints at the various points in the pipeline. In addition, storage capacity is assum ed to be sufficient and 90 not included as a cost. The m odel derived below is used to capture the logistical cost components: TC = (RCRC N + T CEQT CE + EEQT EE + Dem CEDem RC + Dem EEDem REE + (S iCE+SiEE)SC + IRVSku i), where TC = Total cost of the system over 52 weeks RC = Rail car tariff rate RC N = Num ber of rail cars loaded at country elevator T CE = Test cost per lot at country elevator QT CE = Num ber of lots tested T EE = Export elevator testing cost per lot QT EE = Num ber of lots tested Dem CE = Num ber of rail cars dem urrage is applied on at country elevator Dem RC = Dem urrage charge applied per rail car Dem EE = Num ber of bushels on which dem urrage is applied at export elevator Dem REE = Export elevator dem urrage rate per bushel S iEE = Quantity of SKUi substituted at export elevator S iCE = Quantity of SKU i substituted at country elevator SC = Cost or forgone prem ium of substituting to a lower-quality SKU IR = Interest cost applied VSku i = Price paid for SKU i by system participants There are m any costs to consider in this equation. Costs included in a bulk system include demurrage, interest costs of storage, and transportation costs. Identity preservation of products requires m ore thoroughness in the pipeline in the area of quality m anagem ent. Testing and substitution costs are included to capture segregation costs. Forgone prem iums for substitution need to be included due to the possibility of filling lower-quality 91 SKUs with higher-quality SKUs to m eet dem and requirem ents. Testing is added to ensure conform ity of specified dem and for non-GM SKUs. A profit equation could also be derived in which the objective of the m odel would be to optim ize prof its. Revenue in this prof it equation is calculated by m ultiplying the quantity of a particular SKU that is sold at export by the price paid by the purchaser or the market value of the SKU at export. Costs include the aforem entioned factors. The equation would be stated as follows: = (TR - TC), where = Profit of the system over 52 weeks TR = Total revenues of the system over 52 weeks TC = Total cost of the system over 52 weeks Summary There are an increasing num ber of studies related to the concepts of identity preservation and segregation in the grain-m arketing system . Important factors to consider include the role that increased segregations have on the m arketing system and the concept of quality testing. In addition, a change in the costs of traditional bulk system factors m ay change. The substitutability of grains in one direction adds an expense that should be considered. In concept, a cost should be applied if prem ium grade grains are substituted to meet inferior grain dem and because prem ium grains are not used at their best use, and an econom ic cost is applied for this inefficiency. The quantified cost is the difference between the price of the prem ium and the inferior grain. 92 Material requirem ents planning is an acceptable m ethod to m odel the flow of grain. Simulation m odeling allows one to create distributions for lead-tim es between the origination and term inal m arket, and to capture som e of the uncertainty in a logistical pipeline. This supply schedule is able to account for uncertainty and im pose a dem urrage charge when products do not arrive when needed. MRP m odeling also allows one to track inventory so an interest cost of holding inventory m ay also be applied. There are different alternatives in choosing a testing plan. Larson (1989) suggests three exam ples for inspection. Previous research has utilized single sam pling plans with regards to tests for a grain-m arketing system . The benefit of a single sam pling plan is the time factor. However, double and sequential sam pling plans are likely to provide im proved accuracy over a single sam pling plan. The cost of queuing is im portant to the grain pipeline and needs to be considered when choosing a testing technique. The drawbacks of single sam pling plans are that the sam ple that is taken m ay not be representative of the entire lot, which can provide f alse positives and negatives. These f actors all need to be considered in determ ining a testing m ethod for a grain supply chain. 93 CHAPTER 4 EMPIRICAL MODEL Introduction This chapter describes the developm ent of a sim ulation m odel that captures the flows and costs of a grain supply chain. The three functions included in the m odel are a country elevator, transportation by rail, and an export elevator. A general description of the model is described in the next section. An overview of the data sources and the sim ulation procedures used are described in the following sections. Model Overview Material requirem ents planning (MRP) m ethodology is used to m odel grain movem ent through a pipeline. There are actually two different m odels used in this research. A Pre-Genetic (Pre-GM) m odel is used to determ ine logistical costs before the introduction of genetically m odified wheat. A Post-Genetic (Post-GM) m odel is defined to calculate prospective logistical costs after the introduction of genetically m odified wheat into the logistical pipeline. Dem and at the export elevator is the m ain com ponent of the MRP m odel. Dem and is forecast from weekly export inspection figures. In the m odel, a dem and forecast is the force that pulls grain through the pipeline from the country elevator to the export elevator. Shipping decisions are based on this dem and forecast. Wheat is pulled through the system from an origination area that includes a num ber of country elevators. Rail cars are ordered for placem ent due to forecasted dem and at the export elevator four weeks ahead of the current week. Rail cars arrive at the country elevator, are loaded with grain, and are then tr ansported to the export elevator. Transit tim e 94 is defined as the tim e when grain is loaded and ready to be shipped from the country elevator until the grain is in position to unload at the export term inal (Carlson, 1998). The export facility is the destination for the grain and is the point of dem and. Grain can either be stored if storage capacity allows or loaded onto vessels to m eet actual dem and requirem ents. Actual dem and at the export elevator is m et from the grain in storage at the elevator or by the grain that arrived by rail that week. Dem urrage is incurred when there is inefficient use of the transportation equipm ent. If equipm ent is held longer than allowed by the carrier, dem urrage is applied. Dem urrage occurs at the country elevator when inadequate grain supplies are present to fill the num ber of rail cars that are ready to load at the country elevator in the week. At the export facility, demurrage charges are applied when the actual export dem and cannot be attained by wheat on hand at the export elevator for a given week. Substitution of wheat categories is allowed at both the country elevator and export elevator to m eet dem and requirem ents. Substitution of higher-quality categories of wheat into lower-quality categories is allowed but not vice versa. At the export elevator, substitution is only allowed if the cost of doing so is less than the dem urrage charge applied. In the Post-GM m odel, testing is added at two points in the supply chain where grain changes hands to ensure the genetic integrity of the lot. Two testing m ethods are used, including Polym erase Chain Reaction (PCR) and im munoassay tests, which include the ELISA test and the Lateral-flow strip test. The grain supply chain m odel is developed to quantify the costs associated with having to transport an increased num ber of se gregations. Figure 4.1 provides an illustration of grain flows throughout the system . 95 38 Categories (19 GM and 19 non-GM) of Grain Enter System - Country Elevator Classified GM Classified Non-GM GM Storage and Marketing Channel Test at Country Elevator for Non-GM Classified as GM Classified as Non-GM GM Storage and Marketing Channel Non-GM Storage and Marketing Channel GM and Non-GM Loaded i nto Rail Cars and t ransport ed to export elevator to Meet Export Demand Non-GM Tested upon Arrival at Export Classified as GM Classified as Non-GM Volume of GM At Export Volume of Non-GM At Export Possible Contamination Possi ble Contamination Vessel Arrival for Loading of 8 GM and 8 Non-GM SKUs Vessel Hold Loaded for GM Vessel Hold Loaded for Non-GM 16 SKUS are Exported from the System Figure 4.1. Grain Flow Diagram . 96 Mathematical Model Description The m athem atical m odel includes those logistical costs seen as im portant for capturing the costs of increasing quality categories handled by the pipeline. Costs included in this study are rail tariff rates, interest costs of storage, substitution costs, dem urrage costs, and testing costs associated with the adoption of genetically m odified wheat. The costs are calculated for 52 weeks by using the following equation: TC = (RCRC N + T CEQT CE + EEQT EE + Dem CEDem RC + Dem EEDem REE + (SiCE+SiEE)SC + IRVSku i), where TC = Total cost of system over 52 weeks RC = Rail car tariff rate RC N = Num ber of rail cars loaded at country elevator T CE = Test cost per lot at country elevator QT CE = Num ber of lots tested T EE = Export elevator testing cost per lot QT EE = Num ber of lots tested Dem CE = Num ber of rail cars dem urrage is applied on at country elevator Dem RC = Dem urrage charge applied per rail car Dem EE = Num ber of bushels on which dem urrage is applied at export elevator Dem REE = Export elevator dem urrage rate per bushel S iEE = Quantity of SKUi substituted at export elevator S iCE = Quantity of SKU i substituted at country elevator SC = Cost or forgone prem ium of substituting to a lower-quality SKU IR = Interest cost applied VSku i = Price paid for SKU i by system participants The cost of cleaning f or substitution of a high dockage to low dockage SKU is included as a forgone prem ium cost. In addition, costs of elevation are not included and 97 are considered constant. Queuing costs are not included, and the tim e required to com plete an analysis for a genetic test is assum ed to be constant. Due to the lack of detail found on queuing costs in a supply chain when inspection is included, this cost is not included and is not considered to be burdensom e to the pipeline for this m odel. Increasing elevator storage is also not included due to a lack of inform ation on the costs of adding m ore storage capacity as it is required. It seem s logical that, as m ore storage bins are needed to handle an increasing num ber of quality categories, there will be additional capital outlays that increase logistical costs. Average cost is determ ined by dividing the annual total cost of the system by the annual volum e of bushels loaded onto vessels. Detailed Description of Model This section provides a m ore detailed description of the m odel. The flow of grain and how the various logistical costs are calculated are included in the following sections. Country Elevator Model Details The m odel reacts to changes in forecast dem and at the export elevator. The export elevator draws wheat from a num ber of country elevators, represented by a scalar in the model. The actual num ber of elevators in the draw area is unknown, so a value that provides the export elevator with a large enough volum e to m eet its requirem ents is chosen. In the Post-GM m odel, a test occurs on the non-genetically m odified (non-GM) wheat at the country elevator, which is the point of entry into the pipeline. There is no need to test the genetically m odified (GM) wheat since it is allocated to a separate path and considered to be the inferior SKU. The test is defined by a binom ial distribution. This 98 binom ial distribution represents the probability of accepting a lot based on a level of adventitious com mingling and the test accuracy. After the test is com pleted, the grain is allocated to a storage area dedicated for each particular SKU. Storage space at the country elevator is allocated on a percentage basis determ ined by throughput. In the m odel, it is assum ed that the country elevator has a sufficient num ber of storage bins for storing all of the quality categories received. Allocating storage based on the SKU throughput allows for an optim al storage configuration for the country elevator. Rail Ordering and Transit Model Details Rail cars are ordered based on expected dem and four weeks ahead of the current week. If the expected dem and in four weeks cannot be achieved by the current grain in house at the export elevator plus the am ount scheduled to arrive less the dem and previous to the fourth week, rail cars are ordered to m eet the dem and so that a shortage does not occur. Rail cars are ordered even if there is not sufficient volum e at the country elevator to meet the export elevator dem and. The export elevator m ust meet its dem and, so it sends out rail cars to m eet the necessary volum e needed. The export elevator also orders to maintain a safety stock equivalent in volum e to one week of average dem and. Rail cars arrive based on a distribution of placem ent. Rail cars are filled from the SKU that they were ordered for when a sufficient volum e of that SKU exists at the country elevator. If the entire volum e cannot be m et from the desired SKU, the m odel searches other SKUs of higher quality to f ill the rem aining volum e. A substitution cost equal to the difference in m arket value between the SKUs is charged to the system when this occurs. If only a partial rail car can be filled, the partial amount is held over until an entire rail car can 99 be loaded. After the rail cars are loaded, a distribution allocates the rail car arrival at the export elevator in periods of one to three weeks. Export Elevator Model Details As rail cars arrive, they are allocated to their specific SKU storage or to m eet the SKUs export vessel dem and. The identity of each rail car by SKU is considered known upon its arrival from the country elevator. In the Post-GM m odel, non-GM rail cars are tested upon arrival at the export elevator and allocated to the proper storage facility after they have been tested. A binom ial distribution is used to represent the test. This distribution is used to determ ine the allocation of the non-GM wheat SKUs. GM products pass through to their designated storage facilities without being tested. Storage is based on throughput; so higher-volum e SKUs receive m ore storage capacity. Storage allocation based on throughput allows for an optim al storage configuration at the e xport elevator. It is assum ed that there are a sufficient num ber of storage bins at the export elevator to receive and handle all quality categories. Due to the lack of information on costs of adding m ore storage, this aspect is not included, but it is understood that adding capital by way of m ore storage would increase costs to the system . The grain in house at the export elevator is used to m eet weekly dem and. If the entire dem and for a particular SKU cannot be m et from its own volum e, the m odel searches for higher-quality SKUs to m eet the rem aining volum e. A charge is incurred equal to the difference in m arket value of the SKUs used. The m odel does not allow substitution of SKUs at the export elevator if the cost of substitution, or the difference in the m arket values, is greater than the cost of dem urrage. 100 Detailed Description of Model Elements and Parameter Calculations The following sections describe the data sources for the param eters used in the model. Param eter calculations are described, and the behavior of the data is also presented. Demand Norm al distributions are assum ed for weekly export dem and and the forecast of export dem and. The weekly m ean and standard deviation are derived from the Grain Transportation Report (1996-2000) that is publishe d weekly by the USDA. It provides data on the volum e of wheat inspections for export from the Pacific Northwest (PNW ). One demand distribution is a forecast of dem and that is used for rail car orders, and another distribution is used to determ ine the actual weekly dem and at the export elevator. The distributions are derived for each week usi ng data covering the period from 1996 to 2000. The average and standard deviation for each week are calculated to determ ine a norm al distribution of dem and for each week. The distributions for dem and and forecast dem and are included to allow for uncertainty in dem and at the export elevator. The forecast and actual dem and use the sam e average and standard deviation, but are different distributions. Using two distributions allows for the expected and actual dem and to vary. If the sam e distribution is used for the forecast and actual dem and, the forecast would always be the same as actual dem and. This forecasted, or expected, level of dem and creates a m ore realistic scenario of greater uncertainty between what is forecast and what actually occurs. The m odel evaluates dem and only for Hard Red Spring (HRS) wheat, so a percentage value of 29.67% of the total wheat weekly inspections at the PNW is taken to represent the am ount of HRS wheat dem anded at the PNW . This percentage is calculated 101 from Export Grain Inspection Service (EGIS) data (2000) by evaluating the volum e of different classes of wheat exported per year from the Pacific Northwest. The m odel represents one export facility of average size in the Pacific Northwest. There are nine export facilities in the Pacific Northwest with varying storage capacities. The average storage size is calculated from Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) data (2000) on export facility capacity. This average export facility is taken to represent 11% of the Pacific Northwest wheat throughput. Fi gure 4.2 provides a representation of dem and characteristics for HRS wheat exported from the Pacific Northwest.

HRS Dem and Distribution at the Pacific Northwest. 102 Receipts North Dakota Agriculture Statistics Service data (1991-1995) are used to derive a distribution for farm er deliveries to an elevator. The receipt value is calculated from taking an index of farm er deliveries per m onth on a value basis along with the overall wheat deliveries for the year at the elevator. These two factors are used to derive an average monthly wheat delivery volum e to an elevat or. Dividing the m onthly average by six approxim ates the standard deviation. The m onthly average is converted to a weekly average by dividing the m ean by the num ber of weeks in the m onth. Deriving a weekly standard deviation from a monthly deviation valu e is m ore difficult. First, the variance of the m onth is divided by the num ber of weeks in the m onth. Then, the square root of this value is taken to determ ine the standard devia tion for a week. A norm al distribution is used to represent the uncertainty about weekly producer deliveries into the system . The origination for one country elevator is m ultiplied by a scalar to ensure enough supply in the pipeline to m eet the dem and for an average size export facility in the Pacific Northwest. This scalar value is unknown, so sensitivities are conducted to determ ine the effects of larger and sm aller origination capacities. Figure 4.3 represents the distribution of receiva bles at a country elevator or point of origin. The figure represents the distribution for one country elevator. The scalar value implem ented for the origination volum e affects both the m ean and standard deviation of the distribution for receipts. As the scalar increases, the m ean value of receipts increases, but the volatility of receipts increases as well. 103 Stock-Keeping Unit Definitions and Values Wheat can be divided into dif ferent categories based on its quality characteristics. In this research, stock-keeping units (SKUs) are used to define categories of HRS wheat. Export Grain Inspection Service (EGIS) data for HRS wheat are taken from the Grain Inspection Packers and Stockyards Adm inistration, Federal Grain Inspection Service . Harvest quality data f or North Dakota is taken f rom the Departm ent of Cereal Chem istry and Technology, North Dakota State University (1999).1 This harvest quality data is also used in the \"Quality of the Regional Hard Red Spring W heat Crop\" publication.

Receivables Distribution for a Country Elevator. 104 1 Raw survey data obtained from the Cereal Sc ience Departm ent at North Dakota State that are used in the U.S. Hard Red Spring Regional Quality Report were used to determ ine percentages data sources are used to determ ine the num ber and am ount of the SKU present in the logistical system for the 1999/2000 m arketing year. The am ount of SKU present, or percentage, is calculated on a frequency (percentage) basis for that m arketing year. The SKUs are categorized by using grade factor lim its, protein, and dockage levels. Protein levels of high, m edium , and low are used to split the grade categories. High- protein SKUs are defined as having protei n levels above 14.5%. Middle-protein SKUs have protein values between and equal to 13.7% and 14.5%. Low-protein categories of wheat have a protein level that is less than 13.7%. The protein breaks are based on the standard level of protein for HRS and the prem ium/discount schedules for protein that define its m arket value. The HRS cash grain contract is based on a 14% protein level, and discounts and prem iums are applied from this point, which is why the values in this study center around the 14% level. SKUs are split further on dockage content. The high and low dockage split occurs at 0.7% dockage content. Anything less than or equal to 0.7% is considered low dockage, and anything greater than this level is categorized as a high- dockage SKU. The dockage break value is chosen from evaluating the EGIS and Regional HRS Crop Quality data as well as from values presented in a dockage study by W ilson and Dahl (2001). Buyers in the Pacific Northwest are becom ing m ore discrim inating, and a lower dockage value could be applied for future benefit. The break points for classifying the SKUs are shown in Table 4.1. 105 Table 4.1. SKU Breaks Classifying Characteristic Percentage Break Grade 1, 2, 3, less than 3 - Salvage Grade factor lim its High Protein Above 14.5% Medium Protein Between and including 13.7% and 14.5% Low Protein Below 13.7% High Dockage Above 0.7% Low Dockage Below and including 0.7% SKUs are defined sim ilarly throughout the logistical system , so SKU 1 at the country elevator is the sam e as SKU 1 at the export elevator. Table 4.2 provides a definition of the SKUs used in the m odel. Acceptance levels of genetically m odified (GM) wheat at this point are uncertain in both the producer and export levels. Adoption levels by export custom ers or those custom ers willing to accept GM wheat are represented by a percentage level. This value is calculated from EGIS data and a U.S. W heat Associates survey (Sands, 2000) that indicates which countries are willing to accept GM wheat. The percentage level lowers the non-GM 106 Table 4.2. Definition of the SKUs in the Model SKU SKU Protein/ High Dockage/Genetic Salvage Wheat ALL LEFT OVER %s - Non Genetic Salvage Wheat - GM ALL LEFT OVER %s 107 SKU by the percentage am ount and transfers that volum e to the GM SKU. The production is matched to the export percentage in the base case, and sensitivities are perform ed on both param eters due to the uncertainty of this value. The sensitivities allow one to evaluate how changes in these param eters affect the logistical costs of transporting grain. For any percentage value chosen, the introduction of genetic wheat increases the num ber of SKUs the logistical system must handle from 19 to 38 SKUs at the country elevator and from 8 to 16 SKUs at the export elevator. The percent level, or quantity, allocated to each SKU is derived from EGIS data and Regional HRS Crop Quality data, and is based on the f requency of the SKU occurring in the data. Figures 4.4 and 4.5 show the percentage of tim e the SKU occurs at the point of receipt into the system and at the point of dem and. There are fewer outbound SKUs present at the export elevator than at the point of receipt into the system . SKUs receive fairly level values at the receivable point, whereas a couple of SKUs dom inate at the export level. Note that m ost of the top inbound S KUs are high-dockage SKUs, whereas four of the five top outbound SKUs are low-dockage SKUs. All SKUs derived from the breakdown by grade, protein, and dockage level are incorporated in the system . The 19 SKUs derived from the data for the origination area at the country elevator are included as separate SKUs regardless of there only being eight SKUs present at the export elevator to capture the substitution costs of not using the country elevator SKU at its best use. Each SKU has an associated prem ium or discount associated with it depending on the quality characteristics of the wheat in that category. The m arket values f or the various SKUs are calculated by taking prem iums and discounts for the grade 2 6 4 3 12 SV 1 14 8 18 10 5 11 17 16 7 9 13 15 SKU Num ber Inbound Per cent age per SKU Figure 4.4.

Dockage discounts are ta ken from a W ilson and Dahl (2001) dockage study, which estim ated cleaning costs at 3.3 cents per bushel to bring dockage content to below 0.7%. Substitution between grades with sim ilar protein and dockage values is m ore difficult to estim ate. Discounts are applied to previously graded crop quality sam ples to obtain a discount value between com parable Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3, and lower than Grade 3 SKUs. These calculations are com pared to industry estim ations and are found to be sim ilar. Each SKU has a unique value due to the com position of its various quality characteristics. The m arket value of the SKU is taken by adding the prem ium or discount of the SKU to the Minneapolis futures contract price for HRS for the Decem ber 2000 (Z0) contract on Septem ber 29, 2000, which is set at $3.25 per bushel in the m odel. An annual interest rate of seven percent is applied to inventories to determ ine the interest cost of having inventory in the system . For the GM SKUs, a discount of 10 cents is applied in the base case m odel. This value is com parable to the prem ium that has evolved for non-GM corn. Table 4.3 provides m arket values calculated for the various SKUs. Figure 4.6 provides a representation of SKU values for the non-GM SKUs. The GM SKUs follow the sam e pattern as non-GM SKUs but are reduced by the value of the prem ium for the non-GM SKU. Substitution An im portant aspect to the m odel is the concept of substitution. A calculation that allows f or one-way substitution is developed. One-way substitution m eans that higher- 110 quality products can be substituted to m eet lower-quality product dem and, but lower- quality products cannot be substituted to m eet higher-quality dem and. W hen GM wheat is added to the m odel, non-GM wheat can be used to m eet genetically m odified dem and but not vice versa. Substitution occurs at the country elevator if the rail car loadings cannot be Table 4.3.

Substitution occurs at the export elevator if the vessel dem and for a specific SKU cannot be filled by that SKU and the forgone prem ium of substitution is less than the dem urrage charge. Whenever substitution takes place, a forgone prem ium is applied to the overall logistical cost function since the substituted product is not optim ally used. This forgone prem ium value of substitution is calculated f rom the Regional HRS Crop Quality data, the Wilson and Dahl (2001) dockage study, and non-GM prem ium estim ations. Discount and prem ium values for protein content are taken from a survey m ade 9 11 13 15 17 SV SKU Non-GM Market Value for Individua l SKUs Figure 4.6. Non-GM Market Values by SKU. export grain m erchandisers during the fall of 2000 to find the value associated with the SKU level. Values between grades are calculated from current prem ium/discount values for grade f actors and applied to the Regional HRS Crop Quality data to determ ine an 112 average cost per grade. The grade factor prem ium and discount values are applied to current classifications of sam ples already labeled as Grade 1, 2, 3, and less than 3 to find the average value of wheat classified as Grade 1, 2, 3, or less than 3. Industry participants also estim ated the discounts between sim ilar SKUs of different grades, and the calculated values were com parable. Dockage cleaning costs are taken from research perform ed by Wilson and Dahl (2001). Dockage cleaning costs are applied to high-dockage SKUs if they must be substituted to a low-dockage SKU. Also, a forgone cost is applied if a low- dockage SKU is used to fill high dockage SKU dem and. The following discounts, or forgone prem iums, in Table 4.4 are estim ated to determ ine the flow of goods for substitution possibilities. Table 4.4.

In the m arketing channel, wheat is inspected for grade characteristics as well as for protein, m oisture, and dockage 113 content. Current testing practices are necessary to determ ine how to classify the wheat based on quality f actors, such as grade, dockage, and protein content. However, genetic testing is not currently perform ed in the logistical system for wheat. This research implem ents testing for genetic m aterial to ensure that non-genetically m odified wheat meets the non-GM contract specifications. Genetic testing for Round-up Ready technology is incorporated since Monsanto has announced plans to release a herbicide-tolerant wheat within the next couple of years. Tests included in the m odel are the Polym erase Chain Reaction (PCR) test, Enzym e Linked Im munosor bent Assay (ELISA) test, and the Lateral- flow strip test. Testing is added in the Post-GM m odel at two points. The first point is at the country elevator, where grain is first received into the pipeline. The second point is at the export elevator when rail cars arrive for unloading. Testing at these points is added to the model to ensure product conform ance to the required dem and specifications. This elem ent adds com plexity to the supply chain. Immunoassay tests and Polym erase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests are used in the model. Strip tests are im munoassay tests and determ ine genetically m odified m aterial by providing a sim ple yes/no result. They are com monly im plem ented at the country elevator level due to their rapidness and low expense. The cost per test is $7.50 for a strip test, and the im munoassay tests are estim ated to be 95% accurate (Bullock et al., 2000). At the export elevator, a m ore com plex ELISA test that allows for quantification is a possibility in the inspection plan. Accuracy is 95%, and the cost per test is $100. However, the PCR test is im plem ented m ost often at the point of export. It has an accuracy rating of 99.9% and is even m ore expensive with an estim ated cost of $200 per test. In the 114 base case, the PCR test is applied at the export elevator. Table 4.5 provides a sum mary of the various genetic test's accuracy and costs. Table 4.5. Summary of Genetic Tests Test Type Accuracy Cost Strip Test 95% $7.50 per test ELISA 95% $100 per test PCR 99.9% $200 per test Testing accuracy is a very im portant aspect of the m odel. A binom ial distribution with a calculated percentage of accepting the lot is included to account for random ness in adventitious com mingling and testing accuracy. The binom ial distribution calculation is based on the test accuracy and the level of GM content or contam ination levels in the non- GM wheat lot. If the am ount of genetic m aterial exceeds a threshold level of acceptance, it is referred to as being contam inated in this study. Contam ination or adventitious commingling is defined as a lot of wheat that contains genetically m odified m aterial in excess of a given threshold level. If the accuracy rating of the test is low or the am ount of contam ination is large, it is difficult to preserve the identity of non-GM grains through the pipeline. Adventitious com mingling is included in the m odel in two m anners. The f irst inclusion of com mingling is that of incom ing contam ination levels due to cross pollination, farm er mishandling, and farm er accountability. This value is highly unknown, so sensitivities are perf ormed. In the base case, the value is set at a 10% contam ination level 115 for wheat entering the system . This value is chosen from estim ates by Genetic-ID and the National Corn Growers Association (Goldberg and Sm ith, 1999). The second possibility where adventitious com mingling occurs is after the grain has entered the logistical system . Adventitious com mingling occurring at this point in the supply chain is labeled as pipeline contam ination. Pipeline contam ination m ay occur as GM wheat is m ixed with non-GM wheat throughout the m arketing system . This value is highly unknown and is calculated at 0.58% in the base case. This value is determ ined from the binom ial calculation for the test that occurs at the country elevator. The value of 0.58% is the percentage of wheat lots classified as non-GM that should actually be classified as GM lots. This percentage of GM lots is passed into the non-GM m arketing system . This value represents a closed-loop system or a possible vertically integrated system in which separate grain paths or parallel m arketing channels are in place and inform ation is shared among participants at the different supply chain points. The level of GM contam ination is increased to represent an open system in which inform ation and profits m ay not be shared among participants. As the GM contam ination level in the pipeline increases, m ore GM material is com mingled with the non-GM m aterial. Sensitivities are perform ed on the pipeline contam ination level due to the uncertainty of its value and to determ ine its ef fect on the logistical system after the introduction of GM wheat. Testing intensity is another issue to consider in an inspection plan. Either a large lot or a sm all lot can be tested. There are trade-offs to these choices in the areas of cost and lots being correctly identif ied. If smaller lots are tested, a larger testing cost occurs. However, if larger lot sizes are tested, there is a possibility of this greater volum e being rejected f rom this consortium of small lots. A sm all lot that is contam inated m ay cause the 116 entire larger lot to be rejected. Testing higher volum e lot sizes m akes receivable volum e lumpy in its allocation. In the base case, every 4,000 bushels (5 truck deliveries) of non-GM wheat are tested at the country elevator. The 4,000 bushels are separated into a tem porary holding area and tested. After the results of the test are received, the lot is allocated to its appropriate storage and m arketing channel. The sam e concept is used at the export elevator, however, here a larger lot is tested for classification as GM or non-GM. Every 19,800 bushels (6 rail cars) are tested at the export and allocated to the appropriate channel upon obtaining test results. Since testing strategies on intensity can vary widely, sensitivities are perf ormed to show the ef fect of different testing intensity strategies. Interest Costs of Inventory Average inventory at the country elevator and export elevator for each SKU is used to calculate an inventory cost of holding i nventory. Transit inventory per SKU is also included in this calculation to determ ine the effects that holding inventory has on the entire logistical system . The m arket value of each SKU is calculated to obtain a value of the inventory on hand. The m arket values are shown in Table 4.2 in the SKU section. An annual interest rate of seven percent is applied to determ ine an interest cost of holding inventory in the pipeline. Storage Capacities and Shipping Costs Storage capacities f or the elevators are estim ated f rom data obtained f rom the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) Grain Elevator Directory for 1999 and the Federal Grain Inspection (FGIS) export elevator dir ectory (2000). Table 4.6 illustrates the average storage capacity for the country elevators and the export elevators. In addition, the 117 param eters dedicated to wheat in the m odel are assum ed to be 50% of overall storage capacity for each elevator. Beginning inventory values for each SKU are set at 50% of their individual SKU storage capacities. Table 4.6. Elevator Storage Capacities Elevator type Overall storage capacity in bushels Capacity dedicated to wheat in bushels Country Elevator (52-train) 930,395 465,197 Export Elevator 3,250,000 1,625,000 Storage capacity for each SKU is calculated on a percentage basis. The throughput of each SKU is calculated to a percent that is m ultiplied by the overall storage capacity for wheat to determ ine that SKU's respective storage capacity. Storage is calculated in this manner due to the difficulty in obtaining storage configurations and bin size. Due to this method of storage allocation, there is always an optim ally sized bin and num ber of bins for the given num ber of SKUs and their volum es. Country Elevator Country elevator characteristics are determ ined from the BNSF Grain Elevator Directory (1999). Elevators that have the ability to load a 52-unit train are used to derive the elevator param eters. The base case country elevator has a configuration that is able to accom modate all incom ing SKUs, which include separate bin space for each of the 19 SKUs in the Pre-GM base case and the 38 SKUs in the Post-GM base case. Storage capacity for spring wheat is set at 50% of overall storage capacity for wheat. Beginning inventories for the elevator per SKU are set at 50% of the storage capacity for that SKU. 118 Export Elevator Export elevator characteristics for the Pacific Northwest are derived from the Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) Directory of Export Elevators publication (2000). There are nine export elevators located in the Pacific Northwest (PNW ). On average, these facilities have 3 m illion bushels of storage capacity, or 81.5 thousand m etric tonnes. Capacity is used to determ ine the throughput, or am ount of dem and, for that facility. Through calculations from the FGIS data, the average size export facility is found to account for roughly 11.5% of overall storage capacity. This value is the best estim ate of throughput for HRS wheat shipm ents for a facility from the PNW . Fifty percent of the facility is dedicated to HRS wheat in the m odel. The export elevator configuration is able to accom modate all SKUs with separate storage. In the Pre-GM base case for the export elevator, there are 8 separate storage bins, and in the Post-GM base case, there are 16 storage bins. Beginning inventory levels are 50% of the storage space allocated for each SKU. Rail Tarif f Rates An approxim ate tariff rate value is taken from the Rate Book section of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) hom e page (n.d.). The charge applied is for a wheat shipm ent originating in Jam estown, North Dakota, that is destined for the Pacific Northwest. The tariff charge per car is set at $4,400, which is $1.33 per bushel when a 3,300-bushel rail car size is assum ed. 119 Rail Car Perform ance and Ordering Rail perform ance data are taken from Carlson (1998), which includes general tariff placem ents upon ordering the cars. Other rail data used in the m odel are the estim ation of transit tim e from the country elevator to the export elevator. Shippers order rail cars to transport the grain from the country elevator to the export terminal. In the rail industry, shippers are allowed to specify a want date within a shipping period (Carlson, 1998). The distribution for general tariff car placem ent is provided by the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railroa d. A gam ma distribution with param eters (8.38,1.42) is used to incorporate uncertainty to rail car arrivals at the country elevator and is applied to this m odel (Carlson, 1998). Transit tim e is def ined as the tim e required f or the rail cars af ter they have been loaded to arrive at the export facility. Carl son (1998) used a uniform discrete distribution of one to three weeks to allow f or uncertainty in transit tim e. Average transit tim e estim ated for rail shipm ents from North Dakota to the Pacific Northwest is found to be slightly less than two weeks. For this reason, a discrete distribution is introduced to the model to allow f or transit tim e variability of one to three weeks. There is a 33% chance of rail cars arriving within 7 days, a 34% chance of the rail cars arriving in week 2, and a 33% chance of them arriving after 14 days. Demurrage Calculations Dem urrage policies are im plem ented in the m odel. Dem urrage is applied to rail cars at the country elevator and to bushel shortages to fill dem and at the export elevator. Dem urrage charges are applied at the country elev ator when a rail car th at has arrived at the origination f acility f or loading is not f illed within the week that it arrived. Dem urrage is 120 applied at the export facility when there is not enough grain on hand to m eet the weekly demand. Rail dem urrage charges are taken from the BNSF dem urrage table (2000). A value of $50 per car per day is the charge applied in the m odel. The $50 value is the average of the peak-season rate of $75 per car per day and the off-peak season rate of $25 per car per day. Rail dem urrage charges are only applied at the country elevator when cars arrive and the elevator is unable to f ill the rail cars. The m odel keeps track of how m any weeks a car sits idle and applies a dem urrage charge until the car is filled and transported to the export elevator. Export dem urrage charges are calculated on bushels of dem and at the export elevator that are not satisfied. Carlson ( 1998) found that a typical dem urrage charge for vessels is $1.40 per m etric ton per week, or 3.8 cents per bushel per week assum ing that there are 36.74 bushels per m etric ton. This export dem urrage charge is applied to all export dem and that is not satisfied for each week. The m odel carries shortages to the next week and adds the am ount short from the previous week to the new week's dem and. Export dem urrage charges are applied to each bushel of dem and not satisfied for each week. Simulation Procedures Simulation uses \"what if\" scenarios to provide the user with a com plete picture of possible results given uncertainty in the m odel inputs. Probability distributions are used as a method to represent risk for a given variable . Spreadsheets are sim ulation tools due to the ability to perf orm sensitivities. @Risk sim ulation sof tware allows f or all uncertainties to 121 be included in the m odel and provides a m ore com plete output (Palisade Corporation, 2000). @Risk allows one to enter the distribution into specif ic spreadsheet cells in place of a form ula or num ber. This distribution represents the uncertainty associated with the variable. These distributions allow for a wider range of events to occur. Each tim e an iteration is executed, a draw is taken from the distribution and represents the value for that cell in the spreadsheet. The spreadsheet recalculates the outcom e for a given num ber of iterations and returns a range of possible results that m ay occur. The user specifies various output cells for evaluation. @Risk keeps track of these cells for each iteration and returns the results as statistical distributions. @Risk allows for a variety of specifications. There are differe nt sam pling types for drawing distributions such as Monte Carlo and Latin Hypercube. Also, a random seed generator can be chosen to ensure that the distributions are drawn in the sam e order for each sensitivity conducted. In this research, a random seed generator is used along with the Latin Hypercube sam pling type for drawing distributions. One thousand iterations are conducted to fill the distributions to obtain the results. As m ore iterations are conducted, m ore draws are taken throughout the distribution; the distribution becom es \"filled\"; and the results are m ore accurate. Data Data Sources Various reports and contacts were used for data collection. Table 4.7 provides a summary of data sources used in this research. 122 Table 4.7.

Stochastic variables included in the Pre-GM m odel are random ness in dem and at the export terminal and receipts at the country elevator. In addition, uncertainty is included for rail car placem ent at the country elevator and transit tim e from the country elevator to the export term inal. Testing random ness is im plem ented in the Post-GM m odel. 123 Strategy variables in the m odel include the num ber of SKUs that can be accom modated at the country elevator and the export elevator. In addition, a scalar is introduced to vary the receivable volum e for the export elevator pipeline origination area. The forecast for dem and is chosen as a strategy and is placed at four weeks. Testing intensity, which is the lot size on which a test is perform ed, is also a strategy variable. The testing intensity includes the decision on whether a test is conducted on every truck or rail car, or in larger lots or quantities. Table 4.8 provides a sum mary of the distributions used in the m odel. The variable name and the distribution's value are included in the table.

In addition, distributions are estim ated for variables to m ake the m odel m ore realistic in the sense that m any factors are not known with certainty. The derivation of a model that is able to keep track of different wheat categories allows for insight into the costs associated with increased grain segreg ations. Also, adding testing strategies and random ness to the m odel allows for the exam ination of costs associated with conform ing to strict quality specif ications. 126 CHAPTER 5 RESULTS AND SENSITIVITIES Introduction This chapter includes the results from the base case m odels and a presentation of the im pacts that various strategy and random variables have on the logistical costs of marketing grain. The base case m odels are desi gned to represent a typical logistical grain flow. Section one is a definition of the Pre-Ge netic (Pre-GM) base case. The Pre-GM base case represents a grain-m arketing system prior to the introduction of genetically m odified (GM) wheat. In sections two and three, results are shown f rom sensitivities that are perform ed on stochastic and strategic variables in the Pre-GM m odel. In section four, overall Pre-GM logistical cost results are discu ssed. In section five, the Post-Genetic (Post- GM) base case is presented, and results are sum marized. The Post-GM base case represents a full system including non-genetically m odified (non-GM) wheat and genetically m odified wheat. A com parison between the Pre-GM and Post-GM base case results is shown in section six. Results f rom variables on which sensitivities are perf ormed in the Post-GM m odel are presented in section seven. A sum mary of the results is presented in section eight. Base Case Definition and Results: Pre-GM Table 5.1 provides a sum mary of the stock-keeping unit (SKU) definitions discussed in Chapter 4. The first colum n lists the SKU while the next explains the characteristics particular to each SKU. The percentage values given in the next colum ns can be thought of as the throughput percentage of total volum e for each SKU. 127 Table 5.1. SKU Percentages SKU SKU Definition Inbound SKU Country Elevator % Outbound SKU Export Elevator % SKU 1 Grade 1/High Protein/ Low 7.2 0.0 Grade 0.0 Grade 0.0 Grade 3.7 Grade 1.4 Grade 6.5 Grade 0.0 Grade 0.0 Grade 0.0 Grade 3/Middle 5.0 0.0 Salvage SKU ALL LEFT OVER %'s- Non Genetic 7.7 0.0 128 The table shows that the SKU percentages for inbound and outbound SKUs do not match up well on percentage term s for what is produced and what is exported. Substitution and blending occur in the m arketing channels due to the m ismatch in inbound and outbound qualities. The m odel allows for substituting higher quality SKUs for lower quality SKU dem and which, as shown by the percentages in Table 5.1, is likely to occur. Figure 5.1 com pares percentages for inbound and outbound SKUs. Param eter values for SKUs are derived in Chapter 4 and are used to define a Pre-GM base 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 SV SKU Comparison of Outbound a nd Inbound SKU Percentages (% of Thr oughput ) Inbound Outbound Figure 5.1. Comparison of Inbound and Outbound SKUs. Pre-GM Base Case Results Measures of logistical cost captured in the m odel include country and export elevator dem urrage, interest costs of holding i nventory in the system , forgone prem iums of 129 substitution at the country and export elevators, and rail tariff costs. Rail tariff costs are a large percentage of the expenses incurred in the grain-m arketing system . An average cost per item is found by dividing the sum of the total cost am ounts for these categories by the amount of bushels used in m eeting export elevator requirem ents. The average logistical cost of tran sporting wheat from a country elevator origination area to the Pacific Northwest (PNW ) in the base case is $1.513 per bushel. Average logistical cost is found by dividing the annual total cost of $20,848,063 by the amount of export dem and satisfied for the year, which is 13,781,368 bushels in the base case. The cost com ponents are shown in Table 5.2. Table 5.2. Pre-GM Base Case Costs Category of Cost Total Cost (000's) Dem urrage Country Elevator Dem Export Elevator $1 Interest Costs of Inventory $1,254 Tariff Charges $18,847 TOTAL $20,848 Tariff costs account for a large percentage of the total logistical costs, representing 91% of the logistical costs in the base case. Cost percentages, excluding tariff cost, break down to the percentages shown in Figure 5.2. Interest cost of inventory is the largest cost to the logistical system in the Pre-GM base case when the rail tariff cost is excluded. The next m ajor costs after interest expenses are forgone prem iums at the country elevator and dem urrage expenses. Forgone prem iums 130 are charged to the system when a SKU is substituted and not utilized by the system in its best use. The com parison of SKUs for inbound and outbound SKUs shows that Percentage of Cost for eac h component - Base Case (Excluding Tariff Costs) - DCE Demurrage Export Elevator - DEE Interest Costs - IC Forgone Premiums Country Elevator - FPC Forgone Premiums Export Elevator -FPE Figure 5.2. Base Case Cost Percentages: Pre-GM. substitution is likely to occur due to the dom inance of a few SKUs at the export while many SKUs are present at the pipeline point of entry. W henever a substitution of a higher- quality SKU occurs, the dif ference in m arket value between those SKUs is charged to the system in the form of a forgone prem ium. Forgone prem iums are higher at the country elevator due to the rail car arrivals ordered to m eet only SKUs present at the export elevator. The large num ber of inbound SKUs is, thus, consolidated to the num ber of export SKUs. 131 Sensitivity on Stochastic Variables Stochastic variables are used to dem onstrate risks that are present in the logistical system . The m ain uncertainty in this resear ch is knowing what stock-keeping unit (SKU) is actually in the m arketing channel. A sensitivity that increases the volatility of SKU volum es is perform ed. The percentage, or volum e, of each SKU is not known with certainty, so a sensitivity is perf ormed to determ ine the ef fect on logistical costs when this uncertainty is added. The results provide a com parison of average costs for an increase in demand volatility. Export Demand Variation A scalar is introduced to the m odel to vary the standard deviation of export dem and. The scalar is applied to both the forecast dem and used for rail car orders and to the distribution representing actual dem and. The results indicate that alm ost all cost categories increase. Export elevator demurrage, export elevator forgone prem iums, forgone prem iums at the country elevator, and rail tariff charges increase when m ore volatility is introduced to the dem and components of the m odel. The am ount of dem and satisfied rises as well due to the possibility of higher export dem and. Average logistical costs are higher at every increm ental rise in the scalar value, which increases dem and volatility. Figure 5.3 demonstrates the relationship between logistical costs and dem and volatility. Logistical costs increase as the volatility increases. A large increase in export demurrage costs occurs due to the risk of not knowing the volum e dem anded for each SKU. Export elevator forgone prem iums rise due to m ore substitution being required to cover the m ore volatile dem and. Forgone prem iums at the country elevator increase due to 132 increased substitution to m eet the m ore volatile dem and forecasts. Rail tariff charges are higher due to m ore wheat being transported to m eet the m ore uncertain dem and volum e. Finally, the am ount of dem and satisfied rises becau se of the standard deviation scalar effect of increasing export dem and. Table 5.3 provides a representation of how the various logistical costs change as the standard deviation of dem and increases.

Distribution of Average Costs as Export Volatility Increases . 134 Sensitivities on Strategic Variables Sensitivities on strategic variables are perf ormed to determ ine how logistical costs change when shippers are able to alter the logistical system through their strategic decisions. Strategic variables on which sensitivities are perf ormed in the Pre-GM era include the num ber of SKUs handled at the export facility, the num ber of incom ing SKUs or storage bin space at the country elevator, and the scalar value at the origination area, which increases or decreases the export elevator's origination volum e of wheat. Table 5.4 lists the strategic variables on which sensitivities are perf ormed in the Pre-GM base case.

Pre-GM Strategic Variable Sensitivities Variable Sensitivity Outbound SKUs at Export Elevator Base Case is 8 SKUs Increase to 12 SKUs Decrease to 4 SKUs Decrease to 2 SKUs Inbound SKUs at Country Elevator Base Case is 19 SKUs Decrease to 10 SKUs Decrease to 4 SKUs Scalar Base Case = 100% Increase to 125% of Base Case Decrease to 75% of Base Case Outbound Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) at the Export Elevator The num ber of outbound SKUs is directly related to the SKU problem being addressed in this research. In the base case, eight categories of wheat that are based on the break points for grade, protein, and dockage are used. The throughput, or percentages, found for these categories is com bined and expanded into different num bers of quality categories to see what happens when there are m ore or less SKUs present in the m arketing channel. In lowering the num ber of SKUs, dockage is rem oved, so the splits are based on only grade factors and protein. Rem oving the dockage characteristic reduces the num ber of outbound SKUs to four for this sensitivity. The num ber of SKUs is further reduced to the two highest SKU percentages. The two m ost frequent SKUs account for over 75% of the grain exported in the base case. The SKU categories are grouped by Grade 1 being m oved to the highest volum e SKU in Grade 1 and all of Grade 2 being shifted to the highest volum e SKU in Grade 2. In expanding the num ber of SKUs, Grade 1 SKUs are proliferated by percentages that have evolved for Grade 2. In the base case, 30% of the overall SKU total is distributed between 2 SKU classes of Grade 1, and 70% of the overall SKU total is distributed between all 6 SKU categories of Grade 2. To expand the num ber 136 of SKUs in Grade 1, the percentage totals for each category of Grade 2 are applied to the corresponding SKU in Grade 1 so that the overall percentage of Grade 1 is present in all six SKUs instead of the two Grade 1 base case SKUs. This expansion assum es that Grade 1 categories develop in a sim ilar m anner in which Grade 2 categories have evolved. The num ber of outbound SKUs depends on the services or choices of grain that the exporter provides to the buyers. As the num ber of outbound SKUs increases from the base case, the logistical costs rise. Of the sensitivities included, the lowest cost num ber of outbound SKUs is four. As the num ber of SKUs decreases to 4 SKUs from the base case value of 8 SKUs, average costs decrease by 1.71 cents per bushel. Increasing to 12 SKUs from the base case increases the average logistical cost by only 0.07 cents per bushel. Decreasing the num ber of SKUs from 4 to 2 SKUs actually increases logistical costs by 5.88 cents per bushel. Figure 5.6 represents the average logistical costs for a variation in the num ber of outbound SKUs. Effect of Outbound S KUs on Logi stical Costs 1.49 1.50 1.51 1.52 1.53 1.54 1.55 1.56 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 Number of Outbound of SKUs Avg Cost ($/bu) Avg Cost Figure 5.6. Outbound SKU Effect on Logistical Costs. 137 The figure shows that costs increase as the num ber of SKUs increases from 4 to 12 SKUs and as SKUs decrease from 4 to 2 SKUs. The cost increase of m oving from four to more SKUs is due to higher country elevator dem urrage charges, interest costs, forgone prem iums at the country and export elevators, and rail tariff charges. Country elevator dem urrage charges increase due to a rise in higher-quality Grade 1 SKUs f or which there are f ewer substitution possibilities. Interest costs increase due to more wheat in the system with a higher m arket value and an increase in average inventory holdings for the system . As m ore SKUs are present in the system , inventory at the export elevator increases due to a need for m ore safety stock for the additional SKU. Forgone prem iums increase at the country elevator due to increased substitution to m eet this higher level of safety stock at the export elevator. Forgone prem iums increase at the export elevator because higher-quality SKUs are now present in the system , which can be substituted f or the lower-quality SKUs. Tarif f costs increase due to m ore wheat being shipped to the export elevator to m aintain the increase in safety stock inventory. Dem urrage expenses at the export elevator actually decrease, which m eans that m ore safety stock is on hand and m ore substitution is possible with the higher num ber of SKUs present. The increased substitution to decrease dem urrage occurs and is shown by the increase in forgone prem iums at the export elevator as m ore SKUs enter the system . Costs that are not captured by the m odel f or this sensitivity that m ay increase include m anagerial and physical asset expenses. As stated in Chapter 4, optim al storage configurations are calculated by the m odel for the individual SKUs on throughput. This optim al configuration assum es that there is an adequate num ber of storage bins for each SKU and that each bin is an ideal capacity. This assum ption of ideal capacity and optim al 138 storage configurations m ay not always be true, so expenses m ay increase m ore than the calculated am ount shown by the m odel. Figures 5.6 and 5.7 illustrate that costs increase as m ore outbound SKUs are present in the logistical system . The distribution of average costs across SKU com binations is shown in Figure 5.7. Logistical costs increase when m oving from four to two SKUs due m ostly to an increase in dem urrage at the country elevator and export elevator. Dem urrage increases at the country elevator due to an inability to m eet the constraints of a m edium -protein SKU. Effect of Outbound S KU Increase on of Average C Cumulative Probability 19 / 4 19 / 8 19 / 12 Figure 5.7. Distribution of Average Costs with an Increase in Outbound SKUs. No low-protein SKUs can be utilized in the m odel, which decreases the volum e of wheat the country elevator has to originate from for the export elevator, which leads to large demurrage charges. Forgone prem iums at the country elevator increase, representing 139 increased substitution to fill waiting rail cars. The diverse num ber of SKUs at the country elevator is condensed or substituted to m eet the generic SKU dem and. Less wheat is held in inventory and transported to the export elevator because no low-quality wheat can be utilized by the system to m eet the specif ic specif ications set f orth for the two SKUs. Having less wheat in the pipeline decreases inte rest costs of inventory and tariff charges. The low cost com bination is to export four SKU categories. The scenario involving only four SKU categories is the lowest cost due to the rem oval of the dockage specification and the cleaning cost. The highest percentage s of incom ing wheat SKUs at the point of origin are high dockage SKUs that require cleaning. Elim inating the dockage specification also rem oves the opportunity cost of substituting low-dockage wheat for high-dockage demand at the export elevator, which leads to a lower logistical cost. Table 5.5 sum marizes the logistical costs associated with an increase in outbound SKUs. Note that, as SKUs increase, logistical costs rise. Most logistical costs becom e larger as outbound SKUs increase, but forgone prem iums at the country elevator actually decrease. Forgone prem iums decrease at the country elevator because the larger num ber of inbound SKUs are m atched up m ore closely with the increase in outbound categories. Most of the substitution occurs at the country elevator, and an increase in SKUs provides a better opportunity to m atch incom ing quality with outbound quality. Export elevator demurrage decreases as well but is partially of fset by the increased substitution costs that occur when m ore SKUs are added. 140 Table 5.5.

In the base case, the elevator is able to accom modate all 19 SKUs. In this section, the costs of not being able to accom modate all SKUs is explored by grouping SKUs first by dockage so that quality categories are not separated by this characteristic. The rem oval of dockage brings the num ber of inbound SKUs from 19 to 10. There are three SKUs for each grade factor based on protein content and one additional salvage SKU. In the final sensitivity, the num ber of bins or inbound SKUs is reduced to four with a separation only on grade factors, with the incom ing SKUs grouped into a m iddle protein category. The num ber of bins, or inbound SKUs, has a large im pact on the logistical costs of the system . As the num ber of bins is reduced, average logistical costs rise. W hen decreasing from 19 to 10 SKUs, or bins, the av erage logistical cost rises 0.85 cents. As a further reduction in the num ber of bins is introduced to the m odel, a m ove from 19 to 4 141 bins, costs rise significantly as shown in Fi gure 5.8. The average cost increase of m oving from 19 to 4 bins is 31.6 cents per bushel. The m ain reason for the increase in average costs to the system as the num ber of bins at the country elevator decreases, or the num ber of inbound SKUs falls, is due to demurrage charges. Export elevator dem urrage costs increase when a there is a reduction in the num ber of inbound SKUs from 19 to 10 because the country elevator is less able to meet the specific export elevator dem ands. The rail cars are ordered to m eet the forecasted demand, but they end up waiting at the country elevator until a SKU can be substituted for them . Forgone prem iums at both the country and export elevators rise when the num ber of Logi stical Costs when Inbound S KUs or Bins Decrease 1.50 1.55 1.60 1.65 1.70 1.75 1.80 1.85 3 8 13 18 Number of Inbound S KUs or Number of Bins Avg Cost ($/bu Figure 5.8. Effect of Num ber of Country Elevator Bins or Inbound SKUs. bins, or incom ing SKUs, is decreased by the dockage factor. The rise in foregone prem iums occurs because every bushel that is specified as a low-dockage SKU by the export elevator m ust now be cleaned. The inability to separate high- and low-dockage SKUs increases cleaning costs and m ay also have an effect on tim ing due to cleaning 142 capacity at the elevator, which is not captured by the m odel. As the num ber of bins is decreased further to generic grades, a m iddle protein bin for each grade is m odeled. Dem urrage costs increase sharply due to the inability to m eet any high protein dem and at the export elevator, which decreases vessel loadings or satisfied export dem and. The following figures provide an illustrati on on the distribution of costs and export volum e shipped as the num ber of bins for incom ing quality categories at the country elevator decrease. Figure 5.9 shows that, as th e num ber of country elevator bins decrease, costs rise. Meanwhile, Figure 5.10 illustrates that a reduction in the num ber of country elevator bins translates to a decrease in the volum e of wheat shipped.

Stock-Keeping Unit-All Inbound and Outbound Combinations In the previous sensitivities, one com ponent is held constant to determ ine the SKU effect on either the dem and or the origination side of the pipeline. There are different combinations that are not represented in this m anner, which are included in this section. Results that allow for analyzing all com binations of inbound and outbound SKUs are calculated . The low-cost com bination occurs when dockage is rem oved from the base case so that there are ten inbound SKUs and four outbound SKUs. The com bination that results in the highest logistical costs is when th ere are four inbound SKUs and twelve outbound SKUs. Increasing SKUs at the export while having only four inbound SKUs is the highest 144 cost com bination and a very good representati on of the SKU problem . Table 5.6 provides a summary of the different com binations and the resulting average logistical costs. Table 5.6. Com bination of Inbound and Outbound SKU Costs (cents/bushel) Inbound SKUs Outbound SKUs Logistical Cost Change in Cost 4 4 179.14 -- 4 8 182.90 3.76 4 12 201.24 18.34 10 4 149.15 -- 10 8 152.15 3.01 10 12 152.36 0.21 19 4 149.60 -- 19 8 151.30 1.71 19 12 151.37 0.07 Note that, as the num ber of inbound SKUs increases, the change in cost between a higher num ber of outbound SKUs dim inishes. The increase in cost at a dim inishing rate is due to the country elevator's ability to keep its specificity and m atch its specific SKUs with the increased categories of export specific S KUs. W hen there are only four inbound SKUs, it is m uch m ore difficult to m eet the specificity of the higher num ber of outbound SKUs. Figure 5.11 is a representation of the logistical costs. 145 4 10 194812$1.40$1.50$1.60$1.70$1.80$1.90$2.00$2.10 Avg Cost ($/bu) Inbound S KUsOut- bound SKUsSurface G raph f or Alternative S KU Possibilities $2.00 - $2.10 5.11. Inbound and Outbound SKU Combinations . The logistical costs rise as the num ber of SKUs increases at the export elevator and the num ber of SKUs decreases at the country elevator. W hen there are a low num ber of SKUs at the country elevator, there are large dem urrage expenses due to the inability to meet high protein dem and at the export elevator. As the num ber of SKUs increases at the country elevator, overall dem urrage expenses decrease. Substitution costs at the export elevator are the highest when there are m ore SKUs present at the export elevator and when a lower num ber of inbound SKUs exist in the system . Less dem and is satisfied when there are a low num ber of inbound SKUs. The reduction in satisfied dem and is due to the increased difficulty of having the right good at the right tim e. This sensitivity provides insight into storage lim itations and dif ferent elevator configurations. Inbound SKUs are representative of the num ber of storage bins available at 146 the country elevator. Export SKUs represent the specificity of products desired and the number of export elevator storage bins. The results show that logistical costs increase as the num ber of outbound SKUs increase, regardless of the incom ing num ber of SKUs. In m oving from 4 to 12 outbound SKUs with 4 inbound SKUs, costs increase 18 cents per bushel, whereas m oving from 4 to 12 outbound SKUs with 19 inbound SKUs increases logistical costs by only 0.07 cents per bushel. The large increase in costs that occurs when only four inbound SKUs are present is due to high dem urrage charges and forgone prem iums of substitution. Fewer inbound SKUs translates into an inability to m eet the dem and of more specif ic SKU categories. When m ore outbound SKUs are present in the system , the rise in logistical costs is due to higher forgone prem iums at the export elevator due to an increased possibility to substitute to meet vessel loadings, an increase in interest costs, and an increase in country elevator demurrage. Logistical costs are the highest when only four inbound SKUs are present in the system because the inbound SKUs are grouped to a m iddle-protein SKU. W hen only middle-protein SKUs are present in the system , no high-protein SKU dem and can be satisfied in the m odel, leading to large dem urrage charges at the country elevator because the rail cars are ordered to m eet the high protein dem and but are never f illed. Logistical costs could be lowered if two criteria were m et. They include (1) identical storage bin configurations at the country elevator and export elevator to decrease capital costs and (2) adequate volum es of each SKU dem anded at the export elevator would need to be present at the origination area to avoid shortages or dem urrage charges. Less substitution would occur f rom a dim inished num ber of storage bins or quality categories at the country elevator as storage configurations becom e identical. If 147 adequate volum es are present, no substitution is needed, which would decrease substitution costs. For exam ple, the com bination of four inbound and four outbound SKUs does not result in the lowest logistical cost (Table 5.6). In this configuration, inbound SKUs consisted of Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3, and a salvage SKU with m edium protein levels and high-dockage content, whereas the four outbound SKUs consisted of Grades 1 and 2 with high-protein and m iddle-protein levels with hi gh dockage content. In essence, the inbound and outbound SKUs were not evenly m atched ev en though storage bin configurations were identical. Since SKU volum es were not properly m atched, high dem urrage charges resulted. If SKUs were produced in the sam e manner in which they are dem anded, capital costs and substitution costs would be reduced. Origination Capacity An origination capacity scalar at the point of receipt in the country is used to represent origination capability to m eet export requirem ents. In the base case, there are 14 country elevators from which to draw recei pts. Fourteen elevators represent 100% origination capability. This value is altered on a percentage basis, decreased to 75% of the base case and increased to 125% of the base case, to evaluate the im pacts of the draw volum e on the export elevators' ability to m eet dem and requirem ents. As the origination area increases in size, the f acility is able to m eet dem and requirem ents but incurs other expenses from a large origination volum e. As the origination volum e decreases, the average logistical costs decrease, showing that the origination capacity can be reduced to decrease expenses on the system . However, if the origination volum e is decreased too far, the export elevator m ay have a m ore difficult tim e accum ulating the necessary volum es of the various SKUs to m eet dem and. The average 148 costs decrease from the base case as the scalar is reduced to 75% of the base case, and average costs increase as the scalar is increased to 125% of the base case. Increasing the draw area to 125% of the base case value increases logistical costs to the system by 1.67 cents per bushel. Decreasing the draw area to 75% of the base case value reduces average costs by only 0.11 cents per bushel. The results are shown in Figure Cost ($/bu) Figure 5.12. Origination Scalar Effect on Logistical Costs. The com ponent that increases logistical costs the m ost as the draw area increases is interest costs of holding inventory. However, as the scalar increases, dem urrage expenses and forgone prem iums at the country elevator decrease, but interest costs increase larger than the decrease in these com ponents. The am ount of export dem and satisfied in all cases is sim ilar. Base Case Definition and Results: Post-GM Genetically m odified (GM) wheat could be present in the m arketing channel in the near future. A base case m odel is developed to analyze the prospective im pacts that GM 149 wheat m ay have on the logistical costs of m arketing wheat. Strategy and stochastic variables are identif ied in the base case, and sensitivities are perf ormed on these variables. Functions added to the Post-GM m odel include adventitious com mingling and testing. Contam ination levels from adventitious com mingling for grain arrivals at the country elevator are highly uncertain, and the am biguity includes farm er accountability in his/her deliveries, com mingling, cross-pollination, and testing error. The level of adventitious com mingling is included in the m odel as a percentage value in the SKUs classified as m odified (non-GM ). Contam ination levels for non-GM fields were found to have unapproved GM content between 0.1% and 1% in 10% of the sam ples (Goldberg and Sm ith, 1999). This value is chosen as a starting point in the base case. The level of adventitious com mingling in the pipeline to the export elevator is highly uncertain. Possible contam ination points include m erchandiser accountability of the genetic content of the lot, com mingling at elevators, and cleanliness of storage f acilities and transportation equipm ent. The pipeline contam ination base case value is set at the value of genetic lots above the threshold level that rem ain in the non-GM channel after the initial country elevator test, which is 0.58%. This value is derived from evaluating type one and type two errors in a testing plan as well as the assum ed level of incom ing adventitious com mingling. The test accuracy allows som e genetic m aterial to be passed on as non-GM m aterial. The contam ination in the pipeline is this percent of genetic m aterial still in the non-GM m arketing and storage channel after the country elevator test. Testing strategy and accuracy are the m ain com ponents introduced in the Post-GM model. Assum ptions are m ade on the type of te st that could be perform ed at the different points in the supply chain and the intensity or lot size that will be tested. Strip tests are 150 commonly used at the country elevator according to current publications. Strip tests are quick, relatively inexpensive at $7.50 per test, and have an accuracy rate of 95%. PCR tests are im plem ented m ost often at the export term inals. PCR tests are m ore accurate with a rating of 99.9% and a cost of $200 per sam ple. The size of the lot to test is also included in the strategy section. There are a large number of testing decisions from which to choose. In the base case m odel, the country elevator tests every 4,000 bushels of grain recei ved or every 5 truck unloads. A lot size of 6 rail car unloads, or 19,800 bushels, is tested at the export facility. Since testing plans are left to the discretion of the m anager, sensitivities are perf ormed on these base case settings. The base case param eters for buyer and producer acceptance are estim ated to represent a m ost likely adoption strategy by im porting countries and producers. The value of adoption by foreign countries is estim ated at 15% from current stances on accepting GM wheat and the am ount of wheat exported to these countries. This percentage is derived from Export Grain Inspection Service data on exports to countries and a U.S. W heat Associates survey on country acceptance of GM wheat. In the base case, producer acceptance is m atched to the buyer adoption value. Stochastic variables that are present in the Pre-GM m odel are included in the Post- GM m odel. Table 5.7 lists the base case settings for the Post-GM m odel. Adding GM wheat doubles the num ber of SKUs handled in the system . The breaks on grade, dockage, and protein are the sam e as in the Pre-GM m odel except that one m ore split is added to account for GM wheat. 151 Table 5.7.

Table 5.8 provides the base case SKU percentages of incom ing receipts and export dem and on a percentage basis that represents the throughput or presence of that SKU in the system . Figure 5.1 represents a com parison of percentage values for inbound and outbound SKUs in the Pre-GM base case, which relates to the Post-GM SKU percentages. In the Post-GM base case, the values in the non-GM SKUs are reduced by 15%, and this difference becom es the GM SKU percentage and is shown in Figure 5.13. Strip tests are im plem ented at the country elevator at a cost of $7.50 per test and an accuracy rating of 95%. A binom ial distribution is used to account for the probability of accepting a lot based on a given level of adventitious com mingling and an accuracy rating. In the base case, a 10% contam ination level is given, and the test accuracy is 95%. A 10% adventitious content level along with a 95% test accuracy calculates to an 86% probability of classifying a non-GM lot as non-GM. A sim ilar calculation is perform ed on the export side. In the base case, 0.58% of the non-GM wheat lots passed through the country 153 Table 5.8.

The export test accuracy is 99.9%. A binom ial distribution that gives a 99.3% probability of accepting the non-GM lot as non-GM at the export elevator is calculated. The binom ial distribution is calculated by evaluating test accuracy and the level of GM wheat classified as non-GM. Contam ination or adventitious com mingling is included in the m odel at two locations. The first point of com mingling is that of incom ing contam ination levels due to 154 cross pollination, farm er mishandling, or farm er accountability.

SKU Percentages for Post-GM Base Case. unknown, so sensitivities are perform ed. In the base case, the value of adventitious commingling is set at 10% for wheat entering the system . Pipeline contam ination is the other possibility. Pipeline contam ination occurs when GM wheat is com mingled with non- GM wheat due to im proper handling once both GM and non-GM wheat are present in the system . This value is highly uncertain and is set at 0.58% in the base case, representing a closed loop system . Base Case Results: Post-GM The average logistical cost for the Post-GM base case is $1.539 per bushel. This value is found by dividing the total annual cost of the system , $21,189,544, by the am ount of dem and satisfied, 13,772,672 bushels. Tariff costs account for a large percentage of this 155 cost, roughly 90% of overall logistics expense. The logistical costs, excluding tariff costs, are shown in Table 5.9 and Figure 5.14. Table 5.9.

Percentage of Costs for Po st-GM Base Case Excluding Tariffs. 156 The interest cost of inventory is the largest com ponent of costs in the Post-GM base case when rail tariff expenses are excluded. Country elevator forgone prem iums are the second largest expense, which illustrates that substitution occurs. The next largest cost to the system is testing. Dem urrage costs are not very large due to the large draw volum e and ability to m eet export requirem ents. Pre-GM Base Case and Post-GM Base Case Comparison Average logistical costs increase by 2.58 cents per bushel when m oving from the Pre-GM m arketing system to a Post-GM m arketing system . This expense does not account for possible increases in infrastructure , increased m anagerial expenses of m anaging a larger num ber of SKUs, the queuing cost of waiting for test results, or the increased cleaning and handling costs to prevent contam ination. In addition, there m ay be increased conflicts and m anagem ent tim e required due to disputes that evolve from the random ness in testing to prove that a non-GM grain lot m eets the threshold or tolerance levels. Table 5.10 provides a com parison of costs for the base case m odels. Table 5.10. Cost Com parison of Base Cases (000's) Category Pre-GM Base Case Post-GM Base Case Interest Cost of Inventory $ 1,254 $ 1,222 Dem urrage Country Elevator $ 79 $ 2.5 Export Elevator $ 37 $ 34 Forgone Prem iums Country Elevator $ 621 $ 680 Export Elevator $ 1.0 $ 1.5 Testing Cost Country Elevator $ 0 $ 33 Export Elevator $ 0 $ 122 Tariff Costs $ 18,847 $ 19,094 Total Costs $ 20,848 $ 21,190 157 Costs increase by $341,148 in the Post-GM base case. The increase in cost is due in large part to the added cost of testing which accounts for alm ost 50% of the increase. Rail shipping costs increase due to m ore wheat being transported from the country elevator to satisfy the dem and at the export elevator, which includes safety stock orders. The export elevator is ordering rail cars to satisfy dem and and a safety stock level of one week of average dem and. The volum e of dem and satisfied actually decreases. The increased volum e shipped from the country elevator is used to satisfy safety stock requirem ents instead of being used directly to satisfy export vessel loading dem and. The country elevator is able to ship the grain needed to m eet the safety stock levels due to increased substitution possibilities f rom the increase in the num ber of SKUs, which is shown by the increase in country elevator forgone prem iums and the decrease in export elevator demurrage. Country elevator dem urrage decreases dram atically from the Pre-GM to Post-GM era. W hen m ore SKUs are present, the country elevator is better able to m eet the lower volum e dem and level of the increased num ber of SKUs due to the diversity of the production in the draw area. Dem urrage is also decreased due to a greater possibility of substitution. In the Post-GM base case, forgone prem iums increase over the Pre-GM values due to the increased possibility to substitute SKUs with the greater num ber of SKUs present. Interest costs of holding invent ory decrease from the Pre-GM to Post-GM situation. The reduction in interest cost is due to the lower value associated with the GM wheat. Fifteen percent of the Pre-GM inventory is decreased in value by 10 cents per bushel, the prem ium for non-GM wheat, which lowers the m arket value on which the interest cost is based. 158 The cost increase in the Post-GM m odel results over the Pre-GM results does not appear to be large, however, it is im portant to rem ember that an optim al storage configuration is present in the m odel, which m ay not be true for current logistical system s. The ef fect of less than optim al elevator conf igurations is shown in the sensitivity presented in the Pre-GM SKU effect in which both inbound and outbound SKUs are varied to show alternative possibilities of storage bin space and outbound SKUs. In addition, increased managerial expenses due to m ore com plexity in the pipeline are not known and not included. Handling costs are considered to be constant and not included. It is possible that handling costs will increase if a strict threshold level for GM m aterial in non-GM lots is implem ented. A queuing cost, or the expense of waiting for a test result, is also not included in this m odel. Another aspect to keep in m ind is who will pay f or this increase in costs. The model is set up so that 85% of buyers do not want GM products. As this num ber decreases, those buyers are forced to assum e a larger percentage of the costs of testing and segregation. In the base case, if 85% of the purchasers m ust cover the system wide cost increase of 2.58 cents per bushel, the actual cost increase is 3.04 cents per bushel to those system participants requiring non-GM SKUs. The percentages are calculated on the assum ption that 15% of the purchasers who do not require segregation will not have to pay for the extra segregation. As this percentage decreases, those purchasers requiring non-GM integrity will have to cover an increasing share of the system wide costs. For exam ple, if only 15% of buyers require segregation and tes ting, the system wide cost that the 15% of buyers m ust bear becom es 17.20 cents per bushel. Total logistical costs would likely decrease when the percentage of buyers seeking non-GM lots dim inishes as less GM 159 testing is required, but hypothetically, segregation costs would increase am ong non-GM system participants as volum es dim inish, therefore increasing average costs am ong the more discrim inating buyers. Post-GM Sensitivities Several sensitivities are perf ormed for the Post-GM scenario due to the uncertainty in many of the variables. Stochastic variables on which sensitivities are perf ormed include contam ination or adventitious com mingling levels at the point of entry into the system and within the pipeline. The producer and consum er acceptance levels of GM wheat are also unknown and varied to determ ine their effects on the logistical costs of the system . In addition, the discount associated with GM wheat is unknown and varied to determ ine the effect on logistical costs. Strategy variables on which sensitivities are perf ormed include testing intensity at the country elevator and the export elevator. Th e type of test used at the country or export elevator is included as a sensitivity. A Polym erase Chain Reaction (PCR) test, Lateral-flow strip tests, and the quantitative Enzym e Linked Im munosorbent Assay (ELISA) test are alternatives that m ay be im plem ented. Table 5.11 provides a sum mary of the sensitivities perform ed. Testing Intensity at Country Elevator The size of the lot to test is sim ilar in concept to a sam pling plan. In a sam pling plan, the m anager m ust decide whether to test a higher volum e of incom ing products or less of the product to balance the risks and costs associated with sam pling and testing. Sampling plans are im plem ented due to cost and tim e constraints. A strong assum ption of sampling is that the sam ple is thought to be representative of the entire lot. For exam ple, in 160 the base case, a lot consisting of 4,000 bushels is tested, but in a sam pling plan, m aybe a Table 5.11. Post-GM Sensitivities Variable Base Case Value Decreased Value Increased Value Genetic Tests Country Elevator $7.50 per test, 95% Accurate No Decreased Sensitivity $200 per test, 99.9% Accurate Export Elevator $200 per test, 99.9% Accurate $100 per test, 95% Accurate No Decreased Sensitivity Testing Intensity Country Elevator 4,000 bushels 8,000 bushels 800 bushels Export Elevator 19,800 bushels 42,900 bushels 3,300 bushels Contam ination 10% 20% 5% 25% sample lot of 800 bushels is tested, and the rem aining 3,200 bushels are passed through based on the results of that sam ple. Testing intensity is introduced through various lot sizes, and accepting or rejecting the entire lot based on the outcom e of the test. The lot is assum ed to be hom ogeneous in content. The lot sizes to test are varied to determ ine the ef fect of testing either sm all or large lot sizes. In the base case, which tests every 4,000 bushels, the average logistical cost is $1.5388 per bushel. The cost increases by 0.97 cents per bushel to $1.5485 per bushel when every 800 bushels are tested. The cost decreases from the base case by 0.11 cents per bushel to $1.5377 per bushel when every 8,000 bushels is tested. The results are shown in Figure 5.15. 161 Test ing Intensity - 6 8 10 12 Number of Trucks i n Test Lot Avg Cost ($/bu) Figure 5.15. Country Elevator Testing Intensity. The sensitivity shows that, as the testing intensity increases, the average cost of the logistical system increases. The cost increase is due to the higher num ber of tests that m ust be perform ed. The increase would be m ore dram atic if a m ore expensive test is implem ented. The decrease in costs dim inishes at a slower rate when m oving from 4,000 bushels (5 truck lots) to 8,000 bushels (10 truck lots) in the test lot. The benefits of reduced testing costs are offset m ostly by increases in forgone prem iums at the country elevator. In addition, as the intensity decreases or the test lot volum e increases, country elevator dem urrage costs increase. However, the rise in dem urrage is not very large, which shows that there is an abundant supply of the different wheat categories in the origination area to m eet export dem and as the shipm ent quantities can be achieved through substitution. Export Elevator Testing Intensity Testing intensity at the export elevator is introduced in the sam e manner as it is at 162 the country elevator. Different lot sizes, represented by a num ber of rail cars are tested and either accepted or rejected. In the base case, six rail cars are grouped together and tested for a total lot size of 19,800 bushels. Lot size intensity is increased to every rail car, so every 3,300 bushels are tested, and accepted or rejected. The lot size intensity is also decreased to every 13 rail cars, so every 42,900 bushels are tested, and either accepted or rejected. As the intensity increases, the average logistical cost to the system increases. Average costs rise by 4.32 cents per bushel as the intensity increases from the base case of six rail cars to every rail car. Costs decrease by 0.44 cents per bushel from the base case when the intensity is decreased to every 13 rail cars. The results of this sensitivity are shown in Figure 5.16. Expor t Elevator Testing Intensity $1.53 $1.54 $1.59 0 of Rail Cars in Test Avg Co st ($/b Figure 5.16. Testing Intensity at the Export Elevator. The large increase in costs associated with an increase in intensity at the export elevator has to do with the expense of the test. At the country elevator, the testing cost per 163 lot is only $7.50 while, at the export elevator, it is $200 per test. The results show that costs decrease as the intensity decreases but at a m uch lower rate than the decrease from one to six rail cars. The gain in reduced testing costs is offset by an increase in export demurrage charges and a reduced volum e of dem and satisfied. In addition, the am ount of grain shipped from the country elevator increases as the testing intensity decreases at the export elevator because an increased volum e of wheat is needed at the export elevator due to the rejection of larger lot sizes. Larger vol umes of wheat are being classified by the test as not conform ing to the non-genetic requirem ents when the lot sizes are larger. Forgone prem iums at the export elevator also increase as the testing intensity decreases. There is a significant increase in costs when the intensity of testing includes the inspection of every rail car. Figure 5.17 provides an illustration of the distribution of costs for the different intensity levels of testing for the export elevator.

Distribution of Costs for Export Elevator Test Intensity. 164 Tests Performed at Country Elevator There are three different genetic tests that m ay be im plem ented. At the country elevator, there is less of a concern about the percentage of m aterial that is genetically modified, so a sim ple yes or no test is often im plem ented. This yes/no result is determ ined by the Lateral-f low strip test. The other protein test is the quantitative ELISA test, which has the sam e accuracy but a m uch higher cost, and allows for quantification of genetic content in the lot. However, if the goal of the system is to rem ove all genetic m aterial from the non-GM m arketing channel, a test with a higher accuracy rating is needed. In the model, this scenario of high accuracy at the country elevator is im plem ented by introducing the PCR test in place of the protein strip test. The results are quite dram atic. The increased system cost is 5.34 cents per bushel when using PCR tests at both the country elev ator and export elevator. The m ain increase in cost to the system is the cost of the test. However, dem urrage charges, forgone prem iums, and rail tariffs decrease with the m ore accurate test. The PCR test would increase queuing costs and tim e due to the tim e requirem ents of this test. PCR tests require a minimum of 24 hours to obtain results, and m ost estim ates say that 1 to 3 days are necessary. The queuing cost is not included in the estim ate that shows an increase in costs to the system of 5.34 cents per bushel. Tests Performed at Export Elevator There are two different quantitative tests that m ay be im plem ented at the export elevator. The PCR test is m ost com monly used in the industry. However, an ELISA test that also allows for quantification but has a lower accuracy rating is another alternative. The lower accuracy rating is offset by the cost of the test. The ELISA test costs $100 per 165 test, whereas the PCR test costs $200 per test. The ELISA test is im plem ented at the export elevator by changing the accuracy and cost to determ ine the cost effect of im plem enting this test versus the PCR test. Logistical costs actually increase when the lower-cost test is im plem ented. The average cost increases by 2.25 cents per bushel to $1.5613 per bushel com pared to the base case value of $1.5388. The rise in costs is due to the decreased accuracy of the test, which results in false classifications of non-GM lots. The lower cost of the test is offset by increases in dem urrage charges and forgone prem iums at the export and country elevator. In addition, m ore grain m ust be shipped to the export elevator due to the m isclassifications, which increases total tarif f costs. Receipt Contamination The level of adventitious com mingling or contam ination com ing into the system is highly unknown. In the base case, the level is set at 10%. A 10% adventitious commingling level m eans that the non-GM lot contains GM wheat in excess of a given threshold 10% of the tim e. As the threshold level increases or becom es less strict, the number of lots containing GM wheat in excess of the threshold falls, or put in another way, contam ination decreases. As the threshold level becom es more strict or decreases, the amount of lots that are contam inated through com mingling increases due to the strict adherence of the lower threshold level. The relationship is shown in Figure 5.18. Note that the values shown in the figure are not known with certainty; they are just a representation of the relationship between threshold levels and contam ination levels. Adventitious com mingling is increased and decreased to represent changes in the threshold level and to determ ine the ef fect that the threshold level has on the logistical costs 166 Relationshi p Bet ween Thr eshol 5.18. Relationship Between Threshold and Contam ination Levels. of transporting grain. When the threshold level becom es less strict and the contam ination level decreases to 5% from the base case value of 10%, the average cost decreases by 0.20 cents per bushel. W hen the threshold level becom es more strict, the contam ination level increases to 20%. The average cost increases by 0.59 cents per bushel when the level of adventitious commingling increases f rom the base case to 20%. Another increase to 40% illustrates a significant difference from the base case, incr easing the average logistical cost by alm ost 20 cents per bushel. The results are shown in Figure 5.19. Testing costs increase as adventitious com mingling rises due to the need to bring more non-GM wheat into the system to m eet export dem and. Country elevator and export elevator dem urrage charges rise as the contam ination level increases. Forgone prem iums at both elevators also rise. The am ount of grain shipped from the country elevator increases when contam ination levels rise from 5% to 20% but decreases when m oving to 40%, Cos t ($/bu) Figure 5.19. Effects of Contam ination at Country Elevator. however, this decrease in rail tariff expense at the 40% level is m ore than captured by the large increase in dem urrage costs. The volum e of export dem and satisfied rem ains constant in the base case, 5%, and 20% sensitivities. In the sensitivity in which the contam ination level is placed at 40%, the volum e of export dem and satisfied decreases. The distribution of costs and the volum e of export dem and satisfied are influenced greatly by the incom ing level of adventitious or contam inated lots. As contam ination increases, Figure 5.20 illustrates that costs rise at all levels while Figure 5.21 shows that the distribution of export dem and satisfied decreases when adventitious com mingling rises. Pipeline Contamination Adventitious com mingling can also occur af ter the wheat enters the system . Com mingling that occurs after wheat has entered the system is referred to as pipeline contam ination and is an unknown percentage. In the base case, the value is set at the level 168 Effect of Contamination at Country Elevator on Distribution of Average Figure 5.20.

The base case value is 0.58%. However, the base case value assum es a closed-loop system in which no mishandling of the grain occurs and rail cars; storage bins; elevators; barges; and all storage, transportation system s, and grain pa ths are thoroughly cleaned and free of genetic material. The value is increased to 30% and 60% to show the effects of contam ination within the system after the wheat has been classified as non-GM or GM at the point of entry. An increase of adventitious com mingling levels f rom the base case to 30% increases logistical costs by 53.04 cents per bushel to $2.0692 per bushel. An increase from the base case to 60% pipeline contam ination increases average costs by $3.0482 per bushel to $4.587 per bushel. The results are shown in Figure 5.22. Pipeline Contamination - From Country Elevator to ($/bu) Figure 5.22. Effects of Pipeline Contam ination. 170 Testing costs increase at both the country elevator and export elevator due to a larger am ount of non-GM m aterial being brought into the system to m eet export dem and. Dem urrage charges at both the country and export elevator increase dram atically as the pipeline contam ination level increases. Forgone prem iums also increase from the base case values as m ore substitution occurs. Rail tariff charges increase due to additional non-GM lots being shipped from the country elevator as m ore lots are classified as GM at the export elevator and cannot be used to m eet non-GM export dem and. Adventitious com mingling that occurs within the pipeline has a signif icant ef fect on the logistical costs due to the uncertainty of the category's classification when it arrives at the export elevator to m eet export dem and. Contam ination levels influence the distribution of average costs and the am ount of export dem and that is satisfied. Figures 5.23 and 5.24 provide an illustration of this ef fect.

Distribution of Export Volum e Shipped for Levels of Pipeline Contam ination. Producer Adoption Producer adoption levels are introduced by changing the percent of genetic m aterial brought into the system at the country elevator. The volum e or percentage level of the incom ing genetic SKUs is reduced or increased with the rem aining volum e or percentage level allocated to the non-genetic com parable SKU. Producer adoption is uncertain and is matched to export acceptance, which is estim ated at 15% in the base case. The value is changed to show how producer adoption levels influence logistical costs. When producer levels of acceptance are reduced to 5%, the average cost decreases by 0.07 cents per bushel to $1.5381 per bushel. W hen producer adoption levels increase to 25%, the average cost increases by 0.72 cents per bushel to $1.546 per bushel. The change is not dram atic, but as less GM wheat is grown, it is easier to m eet the non-GM export demand, which constitutes a higher volum e of the exports. The results are shown in Figure 172 5.25. Non-GM wheat is also substitutable, whereas GM wheat is not, so less dem urrage charges are applied as m ore non-GM wheat is produced. bu) ($ Co Av Produ option Level of GM Wheat g st / Figure 5.25. Producer Adoption Levels of GM W heat and Average Costs. The increase in costs as producer acceptance levels rise are due to m ore dem urrage charges at the country elevator and an increase in forgone prem iums at the country elevator. The volum e of dem and satisfied at the export level rem ains fairly constant for all levels of GM producer acceptance. Buyer Adoption Export adoption refers to the volum e of GM wheat that export custom ers will accept. It is introduced into the export dem and SKU percentages in the sam e manner that producer acceptance percentages are changed for the incom ing SKU receipts. The acceptance level is increased from the base case value to 25% and decreased to 5% to evaluate the effect that consum er acceptance has on logistical costs. 173 As the acceptance level of GM wheat incr eases, the logistical costs decrease by 0.78 cents per bushel. If consum ers are less willing to accept GM wheat, the logistical costs increase by 2.61 cents per bushel. The relationship is shown in Figure 5.26. Avg Cost ($/bu) Figure 5.26. Buyer Adoption Levels of GM W heat and Average Costs. The dim inished acceptance of GM wheat increases the logistical costs of the system . Testing costs at both locations rise due to m ore non-GM wheat being brought into the system to m eet dem and. Dem urrage charges increase at both locations due to the inability to m eet the m ore specific requirem ents. Forgone prem iums increase at the country elevator due to m ore substitution occurring to m eet rail car loadings. Tariff costs also rise, which shows that m ore grain is brought into the system and transported to the export elevator for m eeting the rise in non-GM dem and requirem ents of the consum er. The volum e of dem and satisfied at the export elevator rem ains constant across all levels of 174 buyer acceptance of GM wheat. There is a m ore significant effect in buye r adoption on logistical costs than producer adoption. Figure 5.27 provides an illustration of the distribution of costs for different levels of buyer acceptance. It is apparent that, as fewer buyers adopt GM wheat, logistical costs increase for a given level of adoption by producers. Effect of Export Adoption on D istribution of Export 15% 25% Figure 5.27. Distribution of Average Costs for Levels of Buyer Adoption. GM Discounts/Non-GM Premiums The prem iums and discounts associated with non-GM and GM wheat are unknown. Chapter 1 provides a sum mary of non-GM corn and non-GM soybean prem iums. In the base case, a 10 cent discount is placed on GM wheat SKUs. This value is sim ilar to what has evolved in the corn m arket. The prem ium/discount value affects m arket value for 175 interest costs as well as the flow of substitution. As the prem ium for non-GM wheat increases, it becom es more costly to substitute non-GM SKUs for GM SKUs. A change in the prem ium value for non-GM wheat affects the order of substitution for filling SKUs that are in short supply for a particular week. Increasing the GM discount from the base case to 20 cents per bushel decreases average logistical costs. The change in cost is due to a decrease in the interest cost of holding inventory. The GM wheat has a lower m arket value due to the 20 cent discount which, in turn, lowers interest costs. Lowering the GM discount from the base case value of ten cents per bushel to five cents per bushel increases logistical costs. The rise in logistical costs is a result of an increase in the interest cost of holding inventory. Forgone prem iums at the country elevator change only slightly. Export elevator forgone prem iums do not change at all due to the substitution constraint that states that the forgone prem ium must be less than the weekly dem urrage charge. Figure 5.28 provides an illustration of how a change in prem iums affects the average logistical costs of the system . Logistical Cost s value (c/b) Average Cost ($/bu) Avg Cost Figure 5.28. Change in Prem iums Effect on Logistical Costs. 176 There is little change in the logistical costs as the prem ium increases or decreases from the base case. Interest costs of holding inventory are im pacted the m ost due to the change in m arket value when a discount is applied to the GM SKUs. The flow of substitution is also changed when prem ium values are altered, however, there is little to no effect of this shown, as indicated by the sim ilar values for the cost of forgone prem iums in all m odels. If discounts for GM crops becom e excessive, however, it is possible that farm er accountability m ay dim inish to take advantage of the non-GM prem ium to GM SKUs. Higher levels of contam ination occurring f rom adventitious com mingling at the country elevator would be the result of this occurrence. Previous sensitivities illustrated that, as contam ination levels rise, logistical costs increase. Summary An increase in the num ber of wheat categories handled throughout the grain pipeline raises the average logistical costs of the m arketing system . Adding genetically modified wheat to the current system imposes higher costs due to the need of testing for genetic content because of consum er specifica tions. The configuration of the elevators, number of categories, and ability to keep GM wheat separated from non-GM wheat are important factors that affect logistical costs. The grain supply chain is m odeled to evaluate the effects that increasing grain categories for wheat and the addition of geneti cally m odified wheat have on the logistical system . The issues of testing and increasing categories form the m ajor contribution of this research. Material requirem ents planning is im plem ented to m odel the flow of grain from a country elevator to an export elevator vi a rail transportation. Different factors of 177 importance evaluated in this research include the f ollowing: \u0083 Increased grain categories at the country and export elevators \u0083 Num ber of storage bins available at the country elevator \u0083 Volum e from which an export elevator can originate wheat \u0083 Test accuracy \u0083 Contam ination levels (adventitious com mingling) - threshold levels f or genetic m aterial in non-genetic m aterial \u0083 Testing intensity consum er acceptance levels \u0083 Non-genetic prem ium values Results show that the previously listed factors have an im pact on the logistical costs of marketing wheat. Table 5.12 lists the sensitivities perform ed and their effect on the logistical costs as the variable is increased or decreased. Table 5.12. Conclusion on Sensitivities Sensitivity Effect on Logistical Costs Increase Export SKUs from Base Case Marginal Increase Decrease Storage Bin Num ber at Country Elevator from Base Case Large Increase Increase Country Elevator Receipt Scalar from Base Marginal Increase Increase Testing Intensity from Base Case (both elevators) Small Increase Increase Test Accuracy and Cost Country Elevator Small Increase Decrease Test Accuracy and Cost Export Elevator Small Increase Increase Producer Adoption of GM W heat Small Increase Increase Consum er Adoption of GM W heat Small Decrease Increase Contam ination Level (Lower Threshold Level) Large Increase Increase non-GM Prem ium Marginal Decrease Table 5.12 provides a sum mary of the im pacts that these variables have on logistical costs. In som e cases, the cost increase m ay not seem large, but the costs do rise even when certain variables, such as existing infrastructure, m anagerial com plexity, handling and cleaning requirem ents, queuing, and lim ited origination volum es for the 178 categories, are not well displayed in these increased costs. Adding GM wheat to the m arketing system increases costs. The extent of the increase in costs depends largely on the ability to control the adventitious com mingling of genetic m aterial in non-genetic m aterial to m eet required threshold levels. Testing plans that include accuracy, intensity, and costs also are im portant considerations that affect logistical costs. Determ ining how m any categories of wheat to handle will also af fect costs. Matching production to consum ption is an im portant factor that provides assurance that non-GM dem and can be satisfied. It was expected that costs would increase when GM wheat was added to the logistical system . The SKU literature states that costs increase as m ore categories are added, so this occurrence was anticipated. Com plexity and costs increase further when GM-wheat categories are included due to an inspection plan and increased storage needs. The expected increase to the system from the Pre-GM to the Post-GM base case appears to be m inimal, however, costs do increase. Increased storage costs are not included in the results. As the system is less able to keep genetically m odified and non-genetically modified wheat paths segregated, costs increase dram atically. The inability to m aintain the purity of non-GM lots is even m ore apparent when a low tolerance level is set, as even a low level of GM wheat in a non-GM wheat will be out of com pliance due to the stricter cap on GM m aterial in the lot. Sm all am ounts of adventitious m aterial occurring from commingling do not greatly increase logistical costs, however, as this contam ination level rises, costs increase sharply. Deciding which test to im plem ent along with the intensity of testing affects costs in a m anner that was expected. The surprise was that the lower cost test at the export elevator actually increased average costs. 179 CHAPTER 6 SUMMARY Review of Problem An increase in the com plexity of the grain-m arketing system is occurring and m ay becom e further com plicated with the adoption of genetically m odified (GM) wheat. The complexity is due to two concurrent developm ents. First, there are increased categories of wheat due to m ore quality-specific characteristics by purchasers. In addition, the introduction of GM wheat adds a testing com ponent to ensure that products m eet end-user requirem ents. This increase in com plexity com es at a cost. Logistics and Costs Logistical costs in the agricultural grain-m arketing system are im portant due to their large im pact on prof itability. This research has exam ined som e of the logistical costs of shipping wheat from country elevators in North Dakota to an export elevator located in the Pacific Northwest. Logistical costs included in the research are tarif f rates (transportation costs), dem urrage at the export elevator (vessel dem urrage), dem urrage at the country elevator (rail car dem urrage), testing, intere st costs of holding inventory, and forgone prem iums or the cost of substituting high quality wheat into a lower quality category to meet dem and requirem ents at the country elevator and export elevator as well as the cost of cleaning high dockage wheat to m eet low dockage requirem ents. Biotechnology and Its Impact on Grain Marketing The adoption of genetically m odified crops by producers has been trem endous. Within 4 years, approxim ately 50% of the soybeans produced in the United States are herbicide tolerant, and around 35% of the corn produced in the United States is genetically 180 modified. Monsanto estim ates that a genetica lly m odified Hard Red Spring wheat could be commercialized by 2003. If producers adopt GM wheat varieties as quickly as they have soybeans and corn, a logistical system that can handle the dem and for non-genetically modified and genetically m odified wheat is extrem ely im portant. Since genetic kernels cannot be visually distinguished from non-genetic kernels, a testing strategy needs to be implem ented to assure consum ers and buyers that they are receiving what is specified in their purchase contract. Testing and sam pling adds cost and uncertainty to the logistical system . No test is 100% accurate, and often, the results of a sam ple or sublot are used to represent an entire lot. This representation is less accurate than if the entire lot is tested, however, testing costs for a sam pling plan are less expensive than if the entire lot is tested. Genetically m odified grains m ay need to be separated from non-genetic m aterials due to the specifications placed in contracts as well as for labeling regulations im posed by governm ents on food products that contain genetically m odified ingredients. Biotechnology and increased specificity of buyers is increasing the num ber of categories that the logistical system must handle. Biotechnology increases the num ber of categories and could double the num ber of categories of grain transported in the pipeline. In addition, traditional buyers of wheat are becom ing m ore specific in their purchases, which also increases the num ber of categories the pipeline m ust support. Review of Objectives The m ain objectives of this research are to evaluate the logistical cost of increasing categories of grain and to exam ine how testing for genetically m odified wheat in a grain 181 pipeline affects logistical costs. A m odel is constructed using a m aterial requirem ents planning approach that allows various categorie s of wheat to be transported from a country elevator region to an export elevator. A specific objective is to evaluate the im pact of genetically m odified wheat on the logistical system . Testing strategies are im plem ented to determ ine the effect of test accuracy, costs of tests, and testing intensity on the logistical pipeline. Adventitious commingling of genetic content in non-GM wheat lots is introduced to account for contam ination and tolerance issues. Another objective is to determ ine how adoption rates by producers and buyers of genetically m odified wheat im pact the logistical system . Determ ining how the configuration of storage bins affects logistical costs is another important area of this research. Country elevator storage bin num bers are varied to determ ine the elevator configuration im pact on logistical costs when grain categories increase. A f inal objective is to determ ine which variables af fect the logistical costs of marketing grain when m ore categories of grai n that require thorough testing are added to the logistical pipeline. Many of these variables are included in the m odel, and others are discussed throughout the results. Determ ining how an increase in categories due to m ore buyer specificity and their genetic acceptance level affects logistical costs is achieved from the aforem entioned objectives. Review of Procedures Model Description Material requirem ents planning (MRP) is used to dem onstrate the flow of grain from a country elevator draw region to an expor t term inal via rail transportation. This flow 182 schedule pulls/pushes grain through the system based on a dem and forecast for each category, or stock-keeping unit (SKU) of wheat. The forecast is an estim ate of dem and four weeks in the future and is represented by a norm al distribution. The m odel evaluates the am ount of the SKU required to m eet the forecasted dem and, and rail cars are ordered for the country elevator to fill the dem and if the export dem and cannot be filled from current inventories. A substitution calculation is included in the m odel to allow f or one-way substitution of higher-quality wheat to lower-quality categories of wheat. In addition, the substitution calculation allows for non-GM wheat to be substituted for a GM wheat category but not vice versa. Each tim e substitution takes place, a forgone prem ium is charged to the system , which is the cost of not using the SKU in its best use. Market values for each wheat category are calculated to determ ine this forgone prem ium and to apply an interest cost of having inventory in the system . In the MRP m odel, whenever the dem and at the export elevator or the rail cars at the country elevator cannot be filled, a dem urrage penalty is applied. A dem urrage charge is sim ilar to a shortage cost and is also the cost of not using the equipm ent in a tim ely manner as specified by the provider. Elements of Uncertainty There are several im portant areas of uncertainty in the MRP m odel. The entire model is based on a forecast of dem and. Dem and is not known with certainty. Forecast accuracy can have a large im pact on the costs of the system . Farm er deliveries are uncertain. A distribution is introduced to allo w for different volum es of deliveries in the country elevator draw area for each week. Another uncertainty variable includes transit 183 time for rail cars. Distributions are used for the placem ent of rail cars at the country elevators and for the transit tim e to the export elevator. Uncertainty in testing accuracy is also included in the m odel. The test m ay vary in its ability to classif y material correctly due to its accuracy rating. This variability is captured by the introduction of a binom ial distribution for the acceptance of a lot given an accuracy rating and genetic content (contam ination) level of a non-GM wheat lot. Review of Simulation Procedures-@Risk Uncertainty is added to the m odel by the use of @Risk (Palisade Corporation, 2000), a tool that allows for distributions to be inserted into worksheet cells in Excel. The use of distributions allows for a wide range of possibilities and an accurate representation with a range of results instead of one solution being returned. Each iteration uses a different com bination of draws from the distri butions that are input into different cells throughout the m odel. Statistical distributions are returned, and a m inimum, average, and maximum value is returned for each cell that is m onitored for output. The average logistical cost value is the output referred to in this research, which is the sum of total logistical costs for 52 weeks divided by the am ount of dem and satisfied in bushels for the same time period. Review of Results The m odel calculates an average cost per bushel of vessel dem and satisfied. This average cost value is used to com pare costs between sensitivities and the base case m odels. Various sensitivities are perf ormed to determ ine how a variety of factors af fect the logistical costs of marketing wheat. Pre-GM m odel sensitivities include the num ber of 184 outbound SKUs or export elevator (dem and) categories, inbound SKU categories or country elevator storage bin configurations, increased dem and volatility, and changes in the origination capacity. Post-GM sensitivities include test accuracy and test costs, testing intensity at the country elevator and expor t elevator, producer and consum er adoption levels of GM wheat, contam ination levels f rom adventitious com mingling of genetic content in non-genetic categories at the point of receipt into the system and within the pipeline, and discount values associated with genetically m odified crops. Pre-GM Results The m ain benefit of the Pre-GM research is based on the concept of increasing categories of wheat referred to as the stock-keeping unit (SKU) problem . The m odel allows for segregations of different wheat cat egories and calculates an average logistical cost of m arketing these categories within a com mon pipeline. Logistical costs increase as m ore categories are added at the point of export. The exception is reducing to two generic SKUs, but this com bination does not allow for the origination of any inbound, low-protein wheat categories to fill dem and, so dem urrage costs increased dram atically. Moving from 4 to 8 outbound SKUs increased logistical costs, as did m oving from 8 to 12 outbound SKUs. The cost increases of m ore outbound SKUs are partially offset by reductions in forgone prem iums. The increase in costs when moving from 8 to 12 SKUs is less than the increase of m oving from 4 to 8 SKUs. Country elevator dem urrage charges increase for each increm ental rise in outbound SKUs. Increasing SKUs causes interest costs of holdi ng inventory to rise due to higher average inventory levels and higher m arket values that result f rom the m ore specif ic quality categories. Forgone prem iums generally decrease as the num ber of outbound SKUs 185 increase due to inbound and outbound SKUs being better m atched with sim ilar characteristics. There are m ore inbound SKUs than outbound SKUs, so each increase in outbound SKUs m atches an inbound SKU already in existence. Logistical costs also increase when the num ber of inbound SKUs is dim inished. Decreasing the num ber of inbound SKUs represents an inability to separate different categories of wheat due to storage bin c onstraints. As the num ber of inbound SKUs decreases, the country elevator is less able to m eet the specificity of dem and at the point of export, which increases costs. The large increase in costs that occurs when reducing bins from 19 to 10 is having to clean every lot to m eet the low-dockage outbound requirem ents. When bins are reduced further by the reduction of protein as a separating characteristic, there is no ability to m eet high-protein outbound categories. Reducing to four inbound SKUs increases country elevator dem urrage charges significantly due to the inability to meet the high-protein SKUs dem anded by the e xport elevator. Dem urrage charges also increase at the export elevator for each reduction of inbound SKUs. Reducing inbound SKUs increases forgone prem iums at both the country and export elevator. The rise in forgone prem iums is due to increased substitution that m ust occur, as well as the dockage cleaning requirem ent to m eet low dockage SKUs. W hen only four inbound SKUs are present, the results are difficult to com pare to the other two exam ples due to the large decrease in bushels transported, as no high protein wheat is available to be shipped from the country elevator, which also causes dem urrage charges to be extrem ely large.

Logistical costs decrease as the scalar value is reduced. However, as less volum e is brought into the system , dem urrage charges are likely to increase. As the scalar is decreased, interest costs of holding inventory decrease, and forgone prem iums increase. There are benefits to decreasing the volum e of grain in the system , such as a reduced interest cost, but too large of a reduction increases other logistical costs which, in turn, increases overall average costs. The volatility of dem and is also evaluated by the introduction of scalar to the standard deviation of export dem and. Logistical costs increase as the volatility in dem and rises. Results indicate that, as the export dem and volatility increases, export elevator demurrage and forgone prem iums at the country and export elevators also rise. Post-GM Results 187 The introduction of genetically m odified wheat to the logistical system adds complexity and cost to the system . Genetic testing is included in this new system along with an increase in the num ber of wheat categories. Adding genetic wheat can as m uch as double the num ber of categories in the logistical system . A num ber of sensitivities were conducted due to the uncertainty surrounding the im pact of GM wheat on the logistical system . Testing accuracy is vital to the identification of genetic m aterial in non-genetic lots. Different tests are evaluated to determ ine their im pact on logistical costs. There are trade- offs with accuracy and costs am ong the tests. The expensive and accurate Polym erase Chain Reaction (PCR) test is found to be m ost effective at the export elevator while the simple strip test is the best alternative for the country elevator. Decreasing accuracy and cost at the export elevator by switching to a quantitative Enzym e Linked Im munosorbent Assay (ELISA) test actually increased average logistical costs. The decrease in testing cost is offset by increases in dem urrage charges at both country and export elevators, forgone prem iums at both elevators, and a rise in tariff costs due to the need to transport m ore wheat to the export elevator because of the higher m isclassification rate of the low accuracy test. The high accuracy, high cost test at the country elevator increases testing costs but lowers all other cost categories. However, these reductions are not enough to compensate for the increased cost of $192.50 per test. Testing intensity is evaluated due to the m any com binations that are possible in deciding the volum e or lot size to test. W hen testing intensity is increased, a rise in testing costs occurs. This rise in testing cost is offset by a decrease in dem urrage charges and a 188 reduction in forgone prem iums. In addition, rail tariff charges are reduced when a higher- intensity program is im plem ented at the export elevator. Contam ination or adventitious com mingling is the elem ent included in the m odel to account for a threshold level. As contam ination increases, it is assum ed that the threshold level of genetic content has been reduced or m ade stricter. W hen adventitious commingling or contam ination levels increase at the point of entry, testing costs increase due to a higher volum e of non-GM wheat needed at the point of origin for the pipeline. Export elevator testing costs increase as well due to m ore genetic content being passed through at the country elevator, and being identified and rejected at the export elevator. Dem urrage charges increase at both points in the pipeline as well as forgone prem iums due to more substitution being required to m eet dem and shortf alls which result f rom the higher rejection levels of non-GM SKUs when contam ination levels rise. Adventitious com mingling within the pipeline is exam ined to determ ine its im pact on logistical costs. Pipeline contam ination m eans that com mingling of GM wheat with non-GM lots occurs once the wheat has already entered the system . This value is unknown and depends on the level of GMO wheat that is present in the system that has not been channeled appropriately to the GM m arketing and storage channel. Pipeline contam ination also depends on the ability of the logistical system to elim inate com mingling of the wheat once it is in the system . As pipeline contam ination levels increase, testing costs rise at both elevators due to the need for m ore non-GM wheat to enter the system and the larger volum e of non-GM wheat that does not m eet requirem ents at the export elevator. Dem urrage charges increase due to the inability of the system to m eet specif ied requirem ents. Forgone prem iums increase because substitution occurs to m eet dem and 189 shortfalls. Rail tariff costs rise dram atically as m ore non-GM wheat is needed in the system to m eet non-GM requirem ents. This increased volum e of non-GM wheat that is transported and contam inated while in the pipeline is a critical expense to the system . Adoption levels of genetically m odified wheat are questionable at both the producer and buyer levels. In the m odel, non-GM wheat is substituted for GM wheat but not vice versa. This one-way substitution of non-GM for GM wheat m ay change in the future as more second-generation traits are added to crops. For the current system that focuses on first-generation traits for ease of production, however, consum ers see no visible benefits, which lim its their adoption preference. Producing m ore GM wheat than what is dem anded increases logistical costs because dem urrage charges rise and higher substitution costs occur. The increase in producer adoption of GM wheat does reduce testing costs, however, due to a higher percentage of the incom ing volum e being channeled directly to the GM marketing and storage channels. This decrease in testing cost is based on farm er accountability at the point of entry into the syst em. Consum er adoption levels show that, as more GM wheat is accepted at this level, logis tical costs decrease. The reduction in costs is due to a decrease in testing costs, dem urrage charges, and country elevator forgone prem iums. Export elevator forgone prem iums actually increase due to their need to substitute som e non-GM wheat into GM lots to m eet dem and shortfalls. The next set of sensitivities involves the prem iums and discounts associated with genetically m odified crops. Prem iums have evolved for corn and soybeans that range from 7 to 25 cents per bushel (Howie, 2001). The base case discount value for GM wheat in this exam ple is set at 10 cents per bushel, which is sim ilar to corn discounts. This GM discount value is increased and decreased to see how logistical costs are affected. This discount 190 value is subtracted from the non-GM SKU that possesses all of the other characteristics of the GM SKU to determ ine the GM SKU's m arket value. The discount value also affects the flow of substitution, which occurs from the least-cost forgone prem ium to the highest- cost forgone prem ium. Changing the prem ium value had very little effect on the logistical costs. The m ain change occurs in the interest cost of holding inventory. As the GM discount is reduced, the GM m arket value rises, which increases the interest cost of having that SKU in inventory. Forgone prem iums change only slightly as the prem ium/discount value for GM SKUs is varied. Since for gone prem iums do not change significantly, minimal substitution between non-GM wheat SKUs and GM wheat SKUs is occurring. The change in logistical costs would be m ore dram atic as the draw volum e is reduced and more substitution is forced upon the system . As the discount for GM wheat increases, it is likely that farm er accountability at the point of entry into the system diminishes to take advantage of non-GM prem iums. This relationship is not included in the m odel, and it is not known quantitatively how the two factors affect each other. It seem s likely that an increase in contam ination levels should occur in non-GM lots due to dim inished farm er accountability to offset the large discount applied to GM wheat lots at the country elevator. As discounts for GM wheat increase, the sensitivity for increased discounts should return results sim ilar to the incom ing receipts contam ination sensitivity. Implications of Results The research dem onstrates m any relationships between logistical costs and different variables. The im pact of strategic and stochastic variables on the logistical system is 191 shown and evaluated. The study evaluates the increasing com plexity of the wheat marketing system . More buyer specificity and the possibility of genetically m odified wheat are the m ain elem ents adding to this com plexity. An increase in the num ber of wheat categories dem anded at the point of export results in a higher logistical cost. This rise in logistical costs dim inishes, however, as configurations are m ore able to adapt to the increased SKUs. W hen a country elevator can accom modate only four inbound SKUs and m ust meet eight or twelve outbound SKUs, the cost of doing so is m uch higher than if the country elevator could handle ten or nineteen inbound SKUs. Increasing SKUs adds costs in the areas of country elevator dem urrage, interest cost of inventory, forgone prem iums at the export elevator due to m ore substitution, and a rise in rail tariff charges because m ore wheat is transported to the export elevator. However, forgone prem iums at the country elevator dim inish due to better alignm ent of inbound and outbound SKU characteristics. The introduction of genetically m odified wheat has m any logistical im plications. The m ajor change to the system is the introduction of genetic testing to ensure product conform ity. This step increases com plexity due to uncertainty in test accuracy and the tim e required to obtain test results. The second im plication is not addressed thoroughly in this research, but other studies have shown that queuing tim e increases costs. Separate storage facilities are required to saf eguard against contam ination between the two categories of grain. As shown previously in the Pre-GM m odels, elevators that are better able to accom modate m ore incom ing SKUs have sm aller increases in logistical costs as m ore separation is required. Determ ining a strategy on testing intensity is im portant to control testing costs and the risk of not having the correct volum e of a non-GM SKU to m eet 192 demand requirem ents. Testing every lot translates into high testing costs while testing larger lots lead to increases in dem urrage charges and forgone prem iums. Choosing which test to im plem ent based on cost of the test and its accuracy also affects logistical expenses. Having a m ore accurate test at the point of export resulted in a lower logistical cost. Contam ination levels f rom adventitious com mingling and threshold levels im pact logistical costs significantly. As contam ination increases, which m eans that the threshold level becom es more strict or m ore com mingling of adventitious m aterial occurs, logistical costs rise. Controlling the contam ination levels within the system keeps logistical costs from increasing greatly. However, if the system is unable to prevent adventitious commingling of non-GM and GM wheat, costs rise dram atically. The sharp increase is costs occurs because the non-GM lots do not conform to the buyer's requirem ents at the export elevator, which increases the volum e of wheat that is transported in the system . Dem urrage charges rise, and m ore substitution occurs to m eet dem and shortages as m ore contam ination occurs, which results in m ore non-GM lots being rejected because they do not m eet the non-GM classification requirem ents. Ensuring that producers do not adopt GM wheat at a higher level than that of GM wheat buyers keeps logistical costs from increasing at a high rate. Matching production to export adoption levels or keeping GM production below the level of buyer adoption results in a lower logistical cost to the system . Limitations of Study A major lim itation of this research is the lack of knowledge about how genetically modified wheat affects the logistical system . Producer and consum er adoption levels are 193 estim ates; prem ium values are uncertain; and contam ination levels due to cross-pollination and com mingling are unknown. In addition, sam pling plans are a m ore obvious choice over the idea of testing intensity. However, the testing intensity concept does represent ideas that are com parable to a sam pling plan. North Dakota Hard Red Spring (HRS) wheat is the only wheat available to m eet export elevator requirem ents in the m odel. The quality of this wheat m ay differ significantly from other HRS-producing states th at are also used to m eet export dem and. Substitution is im plem ented in the m odel in place of blending to determ ine the cost of not utilizing a wheat category in its best use. In m ost cases, blending of high and low quality wheat occurs at elevators to increase their prof its; blending various quality wheat categories is not an option in the m odel. In most cases, basis is bid up at the origination area to bring a certain quality of wheat into the system . In this research, spot receipts occur each week with a distribution to account for the uncertainty of receivables and basis is considered constant throughout the year. W hen elevator storage is at capacity, receivables are not allowed to enter the storage dedicated for the pipeline and are not allowed into the export pipeline. It is assum ed that these excess deliveries are utilized to m eet dom estic dem and and flow into another supply chain. Dem and at the export elevator is represented by a distribution of weekly wheat inspections instead of by vessel lots. Due to the lack of data on sublot sizes for various wheat categories and the tim e of year in which a particular wheat category m ay be demanded by a custom er, the dem and is satisfied each week on a per bushel basis instead of on a vessel lot basis. 194 Need for Further Research The research on segregation and identity preservation has been revived with the introduction of genetically m odified crops. Th e stock-keeping unit (S KU) problem of m ore specific grain categories is a concept brought into the agricultural m arketing system from business research. It is a new way to evaluate the costs of increased buyer specificity on the logistical m arketing system for grains. The issues of testing, inspection, and sam pling are also areas that are of significance a nd could be explored in m ore depth. Further research on the idea of optim al SKUs would greatly enhance this work. It is shown in the results that different com binations of inbound and outbound SKUs have different logistical costs. Determ ining an equation that incorporates a variable for the number of SKUs that m inimizes logistical costs would be a noteworthy accom plishm ent. Obtaining data on actual elevator configurations including the num ber and size of storage bins would greatly enhance this study. Currently, throughput is used to determ ine an optim al storage configuration for a given num ber of SKUs. Optim al storage configurations are not necessarily the case for existing elevators, and adding a m ore realistic storage unit com ponent to the m odel would increase the accuracy of the logistical cost results. In addition, determ ining the cost of additional storage and how that storage would be allocated am ong the different cate gories of wheat would be beneficial. Adding a blending com ponent to the current m odel to allow for low-quality and high-quality SKUs to f orm a SKU that is dem anded is a m ore realistic approach to how wheat is shipped in the current m arketing system . The addition of guaranteed freight mechanism s, such as COTS or SW APS, that would allow the system to take advantage of 195 timeliness and to decrease export dem urrage charges would also im prove the accuracy of the m odel results. These m echanism s could aid in having the wheat reach the export elevator when it is required as rail car placem ents are better controlled with these mechanism s. Guaranteed freight would reduce dem urrage charges but would increase transportation charges. The current binom ial calculation for accepting a non-GM lot based on genetic contam ination levels within non-GM lots from adventitious com mingling and test accuracy could be explored in m ore depth. The addition of sam pling theory to the testing intensity concept could im prove the results found in this research. Sam pling theory is not explored in this research, but its im portance is noted. Summary This research has explored the concepts of increasing grain categories and genetic content conform ance (testing) issues. These are areas of increasing im portance due to the increased specificity of buyers and the possible introduction of genetically m odified wheat in the near future. Many issues are covered, and results are drawn based on the concept of average logistical costs defined as total logistical costs to the system per bushel of vessel demand satisfied. 196 REFERENCES Abernathy, Frederick H., John T.
