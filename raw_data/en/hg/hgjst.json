Its uniqueness rests in the technology that allows it to be available completely online and able to be updated in an ongoing manner.When I edited the first international anthology in 1998, I did not realize how fast the international employee assistance field would grow. In the second edition, published in the year 2000, we were able to add almost 20 more countries to the volume. This particular edition does not repeat what was in the previous two versions. Rather, it moves beyond the country descriptions, healthcare overviews and legislative backgrounds, to concentrate on the EAP activity in each country at the present time.Valuable resources are provided for organizations and providers of EAPs to access. Several chapters represent a broader aspect of the international movement beyond the EAP development of an individual country. Richard Hopkins provides his insight on the new EAP European Forum, Dr, Reddy discusses his perspective on the international delivery system, and the International Guidelines for Mental Health in the Workplace provide an additional global framework. -- As with any effort of this magnitude there are limitations. Although the effort was made, once again, we still do not have representative material from the Arab world, which is needed for a truly global picture.0utside of South Africa, we do not have any other countries from this continent. We have not been able to locate EAP programs in Italy. However,through my work at Bocconi University in Milan, the Department of Organizational Development is showing great interest. We are hopeful we soon will be able to include countries that are not now represented. Because of the versatility of the technology, we can add chapters; we welcome new authors from any of the countries we have not been able to address. As the third sponsor of the compendium (following PPCI who sponsored the first and Magellan who sponsored the second), Dr. Reddy was of great assistance in securing authors as well as in providing editorial expertise, Special thanks to Rob?rt Levers the art direc*or, ~vho designed the project and Robin !l^asi,the project director,fer developing a relationship with each of the authors, editing and securing each chapter. This compendium could not have been completed. without the authors. Each author deserves his or her own special recognition and thanks for the research, knowledge, and expertise that went into a truly global effort and contribution to the EAP field. This is a work in progress that will continue to develop as the EAP field continues to grow throughout the world. It is my sincere hope that it will help us develop an international network among EAP professionals so that we can better serge our clients worldwide. Dale Masi Washington, DC June 2005 THE ONCE AND FUTURE EAP BY MICHA@L REDDY What follows is a personal view of the EAP world drawn from numerous visits over several years to Employee Assistance Programs in every part of the world from Europe, South America, Southern Africa and Australia to Asia Pacific, India and China, including especially the close collaboration Dr, Reddy has had with more than a dozen of the ICAS offices he has helped establish throughout the world, He recognizes that his views are very personal and may not coincide with those of the reader with whom he will be happy to have a debate ar any rime. In a remote corner of Ireland a traveller asks a shopkeeper the wayto Dublin.'Ah, sir!' is the answer,'you can't get to Dublin from here...not at all, at aIl.You'd have to start from somewhere else!' So where do we start a search for the Once and Future EAP? If we are._to understand the EAP story properly must it always begin from the Pennsylvania, Indiana and iilinois workplaces of 1941, as we have been told? Or could we start from somewhere else? Like the Core Technology of the 1980s, or Macy's employee support services of the 1920s? The answer is no, the folk history is accurate, we couldn't do better than go back to the traditional US manufacturing sites of 1941, providing we know what we are looking for. It is the perfect time and place to start. 1941 saw Pearl Harbor and coincidentally the formal establishment of Alcoholics Anonymous, both events crucially important to the appearance of the EAP.It was a vulnerable period for. business when wartime munitions production increased the need for error free work, at the very time when companies had just lost their most skilled workers to the European and Pacific war theatres of WW2. It was a vulnerable time for many individuals too,even for the nation as a whole, in the midst of the still relatively new post Prohibition social phenomenon of problem drinking. Packed into that brief vignette are all the clues we need to the nucleus of the quintessential EAP. CHAPTER ONE: THE USA Over 60 years have passed since then and rivers don't go in a straight Iine.They go as the terrain allows them. Rivers always get there but sometimes they get there by giving themselves up to stronger currents going in the same general direction, which is what has happened to EAP. In the process we have seen it gradually lose touch with its origins and its very specific uniqueness. We are all familiar wifih the conventional EAP story (and.it won't be re-told here), but the first clue in our own search may easily escape attention; if we fast forward from 1941 to the EAP of 1985 we see at once that this was not the natural successor to its earliest ancestor. Many things had happened in the meantime, many changes had already produced variants of the original formula. Below the surface there is indeed a radical discontinuity between the first incarnation of the EAP and most of its later forms. The Core Technology, for example, that emerged in the mid-eighties was not the only possible authentic genetic descendant of the brilliantly effective creation of forty years earlier, The Core Technology was a call to arms, a clarion call to recapture what was seen as the origins of the EAP. What the Core Technology wanted to rescue, however, was not the original architecture of the early 1940's, not the prototype, but a later and more evolved edifice. True, the authors of the Core Technology had read the signs correctly and seen the danger, protesting in diplomatic language that the Managed Care movement and a rising tide of stress management services among others were swamping the core EAP.And they were right to complain that the EAP's own sweet waters were being swallowed within these larger,stronger tides.6ythen, however,theyhad nomore chance than King Canute of holding back the waves of their own particular age and culture. Yet EAP is still around. Whatever the virtues of the original EAP formula, resilience must be among them.The danger is still there, however, and is the same as the threat which the authors of the Core Technology so clearly pointed out, that the unique component of the EAP within the bigger mix would become so diluted that EAP could only continue to exist as the creature of other greater forces around it. In fact, very recently it almost succumbed to the new Health Savings Accounts. PROPOSITION ONE The first proposition, therefore, is that the search for a unique EAP formula \u2014one that explains every variant, past and future\u2014must go back beyond the EAP of the mid-eiyf~ties to the mint creation of post-Prohibition Hmerica -at-War from which it had diverged. Indeed, the only difference between the case made here and what the Core Technology was designed to do is that the Core Technology didn't go far enough. It mistook the clothing of later versions of the EAP for the reality of what was buried within, and it must be admitted that events had made it deceptively easy to do so, The changes which had taken place between 1940 and 1985 may well have seemed necessary and opportunistic responses to particular times and environments in one particular country, in exactly the same way incidentally as the original formulation had also been a response to a particular moment in a particular situation in a particular environmenfi. The conventional history of EAP itself shows how quickly the original model had begun to evolve, from its shopfloor origins in the forties and fifties, into a more formally structured OAP (Occupational Alcohol Service), before emerging, thanks to ALMACA (Association of Labor and Management Administrators and Consultants in Alcoholism) as the broad- brush EAP of the early seventies and beyond. The broadbrush mental health EAP was a natural and wholly positive evolutionary step, in tune with its own current reality in the USA. It was born partly of the recognition that alcohol abuse and addiction is almost always multi-faceted in cause and effect, calling for a broader base of professional expertise to deal with it. This redefinition of the EAP's purpose was entirely logical, but that should not blind us to the fact that it was revolutionary as much as evolutionary .The implications and consequences in what followed were fundamental. In the first place, as external healthcare professionals took the place of internal specialists the center of gravity of the EAP world moved with them, and two revolutions had taken place, not just one. Not just a move from alcohol as the focus of EAP work to substance abuse and then to mental health in general, but a shift away from work-site-based services to off-site (outsourced) services. To employers, and especially to Finance Directors, the benefits of outsourcing were considerable, To employees the benefits of this change were access to a wider range of professional services and, from a subjective point of view, to a greater security in their confidentiality. More fundamental still, however, was that a third and fourth revolution were implicit in the first two. Performance had now given way to health as the criterion of an EAP's success \u2014offering a more indirect than direct way of measuring its contribution to the business, and making.even harder to justify the costs in Return on Investment terms. Last of all, the EAP specialist had in the process moved fr~rn consultant to supplier, from influencing systems to being a remedial resource, from offering a service to providing a commodity. Once the EAP found itself in a commodity market it was of course vulnerable to price pressure from the buyer.The capitated payment system has always been a big advantage to the provider in cashflow terms but it makes an EAP purchase akin to buying insurance. As we all know, insurers, like vacuum salespeople, are forever having to massage their products into different shapes to avoid price competition, ending up all too often offering more for less, as the sophisticated buyer continues to exert price pressure. Indeed, much of EAP provision was soon absorbed into afully-fledged insurance product (Managed Care), moving as it did so, within its healthcare benefits role, from gateway to gatekeeper. It was atwo-edged sword. The Managed Care movement may be seen to have offered a haven for the EAP for a decade or two until Managed Care began to exhaust the benefits of economy of scale and itself began to struggle with the same'commadity' dead end. It is paradoxical that today EAP, instead of being left stranded, has emerged as one of the most highly valued components of Managed Care systems, to the point where an EAP vendor may even score points by showing itself as independent of a Managed Care envelope. It is also paradoxical that despite its immense contribution to employee mental health (explicitly) and to performance (implicitly),and despite the millions (billions ?) of dollars it has saved the employer, EAP has ended as an employee benefit so inexpensive as in many cases to be below the radar of corporate budget considerations. The American EAP of 2005 in many cases remains sadly marginal to Board level concerns, and largely out of the sight of senior management. its position as a whole (though not for individual vendors) is mostly secure thanks to an inertia that depends partly on its low cost. Meanwhile self-referral has become the norm, the local supervisor has faded into the background, service quality is not generally transparent to the buyer, and EAP can be bought by Procurement rafiher than by internal HR specialists through an online auction. One conclusion from the first proposition is thus that EAP is evolutionary, not static, in nature.ln the USA alone, like a moun- tain stream it has changed direction many times on its way to the. coast, wending its way through the shifting territory of employment legislation, of the American healthcare and employee benefits systems, and of practitioner delivery capacity, on the way to guaranteeing its survival if nothing else. And EAP is struggling every inch of the way to maintain its integrity and uniqueness. PROPOSITION TWO EAP is also therefore essentially contextual. EAP does not represent an absolute in the forms that it can take but, as in the USA, it has shown itself equally subject and relative elsewhere to prevailing healthcare delivery systems, to legal and _ ~~._ firi~i~\u00b0~i~l stri~ct~ir< ~'an~~ ~c ;:he structure and power of local healthcare professional associations. It may be too ea4y to~~ __.. __ suppose without reflection that conditions elsewhere will replicate those in the US. And perhaps they will to one degree oranother\u2014 resemble them rather than replicate.in practice and in constellation ,however,experience is showing that they offer a very different climate and environment to fledgling EAPs in other parts of the world. This\"Worldwide Compendium \"offers a rich overview of the background to EAP involvement in forty countries on every continent.ChapterTwo looks atone country in particular and comes to an unexpected conclusion. CHAPTER TWO: THE UNITED KINGDOM The irony is that the UK thought itself completely faithful to the US EAP model when an EAP industry began to emerge in the mid to late eighties. In reality it had unwittingly created a quite different model, perhaps best characterized as a stress rather than mental health EAP, an aspect of corporate restructuring rather than of healthcare. In practice the UK knew almost nothing about the 3-session model, found \"constructive confrontation\" culturally unproductive, saw the Core technology as more relevant to internal EAPs than to their own commonly outsourced variety. Additionally, UK providers were unaware that they had inherited the health benefit side of the EAP rather than its performance -related aspects. They offered \"managerial consultancy\" with little conviction or uptake, and thought it a matter of pride that 97% of their employee clients were self-referred. Just as strikingly, UK providers in the mid eighties were happily unaware of the separate origins and philosophy in the US of EAP on the one hand and Work-life services on the other. In the UK it was taken for granted from the beginning that an EAP would respond to any and all employee problems of any kind in a seamless way. More important still, the cultural background and history of the UK made it unwise for the British government to take a strong line on alcohol and substance abuse, other than by gradually and steadily raising taxes on tobacco and alcohol to the benefit of the Treasury, and by maintaining a dubiously productive policy on hard and soft drug use alike. In other respects however, and for purely local reasons, the UK industrial and corporate climate was ripe for EAP penetration, though this did not happen overnight. UK business and British society were changing radically and continuously during the eighties and beyond. Outsourcing for one thing was as popular as elsewhere in the Anglo- Americancapitalist system, Thus to a large UK public-sector utilities organization (for example) it was a'no-brainer'to weigh the cost benefits of converting the salary and employment costs needed to keep 50 or 100 Welfare Officers on the road into something like a capitated EAP,while apparently retaining the supportive personnel and welfare ethos which had characterized most large UK organizations for a century and more. __ _._,,. __: This was true not only in the public sector but also among the newly privatized transport and utilities companies as well as in the retail sector where employee support (as with Macy's in the US) had a long tradition among a wide range of High Street shops such as WH Smith, Marks &Spencer and Boots. Meantime, large and traditionally safety-sensitive industries (petrochemicals, chemicals and pharmaceuticals) needed the safety net of a professional counselling service if only for the inevitable critical incidents. And so the EAP movement grew in fertile ground in the UK as a new and cost-effective alternative to conventional personnel (rather than occupational health) policies. It was perceived to be not only inexpensive but also to offer a wider range of professional expertise than most HR departments could boast. In the midst of the UK version of continuous change and corporate restructuring of the eighties and nineties, British organizations were likewise reeling under the growing pressure on individuals to perform. Business re-engineering and downsizing were the order of the day. Movement away from an authoritarian and towards a more employee -friendly management style was imperative,qualityand change management initiatives were everywhere, and demographic shifts saw more women coming into the workforce and with them pressure towards family-friendly HR policies. Even technological advances played their part, as the telephone became a more acceptable medium for counselling, information and advice. If British EAP providers were fortunate in meeting circumstances so propitious for vendors of employee support services many may have been unaware of their additional good fortune in going into business just as the BAC (British Association for Counselling) had found its feet and become the professional home for the still new profession of counselling, It was an unexpected and sometimes unrecognized bonus for EAP providers whose contract with their corporate customers required them to find practitioners competent and pleased to offer short term solution- focused help to normally 6 well-functioning individuals through relatively transient difficult personal situations, In market terms of supply and demand the two could not have coincided more fortuitously. If that wasn't enough, a UK government sponsored institution called the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) has for many years had outlets in most High Streets, staffed by well-trained individuals abreast of just about everything relevant to the work- life component \u2014from legal financial, cgnsumerand benefits information to specialized elder-care child-care, housing and other domestic and social options.Such a national government -sponsored and free service was unique to the UK, (In other places in the world something similar may exist but rarely as comprehensive, In Hong Kong for example a free legal advisory service is available to all citizens). It took little effort for EAP providers in Britain to recruit such individuals on a full or part time basis\u2014with higher wages than CAB could offer\u2014and train them in handling both sides of the employment situation. Irncontrast to the American system, healthcare provision in the UK is delivered through a National Health Service designed to meet the medical needs of every citizen. Increasingly this is supplemented through personal and employer -led insurance contributions but the real and only similarity between the two systems is that neither has much chance of meeting its objectives: The simple fact is that medical science is running (and will always run\u2014at an ever-accelerating pace) ahead of what can be afforded by any means other than through massive natural mineral resources which happen to lie beneath a fortunate government's feet. , The British government will continue to tinker with the NHS and push against the boundaries of whatever level of taxation it dares while healthcare provision continues to be used as a political football by all major political parties. By way of illustration (of another system) healthcare in Switzerland is paid for through obligatory personal insurance again reinforcing the conclusions of Chapter Two with its emphasis on the importance of embedded local culture for the shape and survival of EAP business. In every instance the shape and viability of EAP provision is dependent on the prevailing national healthcare system, on employment legislation and also in terms of the prevailing professional expertise needed to underpin it. The impression among UK providers that they were simply grafting the American vinestock onto its British transplant turned out to be wholly mistaken. The differences were not simply due to local soil and water conditions but to the (unwitting} creation of a new species.0ur UK partners were perhaps bamboozled by the apparent coherence of our two languages, an advantage that of course would not be guaranteed in continental Europe. 7 CHAPTER THREE: CONTINENTAL EUROPE AND BEYOND It will be obvious that generalities in a chapter covering the whole of Western let alone Eastern Europe are implausible. Comparisons cannot even be drawn between the two major east and west blocs as a whole, united though they now are at last in the enlarged European Community. Historic differences between east and west remain well rooted after half a century of political and socio-economic isolation and little more than a decade of reunification. Nor are individual countries within each region homogeneous either in culture, in social conditions or in stage of development. Within the Western European (and older) half alone of the European Union, lifestyle is one thing for the traveller in southern (Mediterranean) countries and quite another in the Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian countries of the north. So far the EAP \"solution\" has made little real headway in any European country, with the exception of the UK, and we have seen that this has as much to do with a fortunate mix of circumstances as to any inherent compatibility between US and lJK mod!~ls; ei~lture and history. Establishing EAP services in a range of.European countries has inev~'~hE~~,.r~~r~ -~~ ;~e -~,<;, my colleagues to treat each one as an individual case. In the Netherlands, for example,'the entry point has been mostly through brokers while EAP provision makes slow headway against a small number of powerful occupational health services (called ARBO's) which traditionally command primary access to employee services.That's an instance of just one, and only one embedded situation in one country. Another variable in the European situation is that outside the UK counselling is not a particularly strong profession except perhaps in Greece and Ireland. Elsewhere across contirenta! Europe psychotherapists may be t\"e dominant profession in one country \u2014and be naturally anxious to protect their territory \u2014where in another it is wiser for an EAP vendor to build an affiliate network of psychologists. Nor is the meaning the conceptual underpinning the training or skills of\"psychother- apisY'or \"psychologist \"necessari~ythe same in each country, In Germany, as a further example, the \"Betriebliche Sozialarbeiter\" (industrial social worker) is a dominant profession and well established in virtually every large organization, as it has been for decades.The shape of their service is quite similar. to an internal EAP\u2014too similar in many cases for them to see much worthwhile novelty or added value in what EAP brings to the big German multinationals. Such variations, country by country, are commonplace throughout Europe and make a mockery of other expectations\u2014 for example, that asingle-price solution to the needs of all overseas employees of multinational clients in Europe can be found where the dollar equivalent even for a postage stamp may in Sweden be twice as much as it is in Portugal.And that's only Europe. Straying further afield and, as it happens, resembling the German industrial social worker\u2014but inevitably as different as it is similar-is the'Labour Welfare Officer' in India. This person is part of a system that is highly sophisticated in the way it integrates an internal \"EAP-style\" practitioner with links to local hospital and psychology resources. And it works very well. 8 On a personal note I am probably too old to lose my western arrogance. I undoubtedly subscribe in my non self-aware thinking to the illusion that\"our way of life is inherently superior to those of the thousands of societies that have evolved entirely different ways of coping\"with the world. I have grown up with the assumption that western civilization represents the pinnacle of human achievement. More recent confrontation with the awesome art and architecture of the mediaeval Arab world has shaken some of my conviction, as have glimpses into the more ancient worlds of China, India,Thailand and Cambodia. They are all different, one from the other; all are monuments to different world-views, different gods, different attitudes towards others, different ways of loving. These ancient civilizations are sometimes presented in the west as past their shelf life and waiting for us to waken them, but the roots and achievements of these civilizations and cultures not only go back millennia before our own but also are. - __ ,.,,_ _ still alive and vibrant among their peoples, still guiding everyday lives and thought. it is sometimes considered'acceptable in the West to praise their art and religions but take a more superior attitude towards their medicine,their science, and their political financial and commercial systems --a dangerous luxury, I would suggest. Indeed,a lady with a crystal ball whom I consult from time to time tells me that the days are closer than we think to a range of different kinds of democracy, to several variants of capitalism \u2014and on that basis alone I would expect to see numerous variants of the EAP. What a marvelous time to be alive and to pray that we don't try too hard to export the straitjacketed version of the EAP we have tied ourselves into The question to ask is not so much this: how may we adapt the EAP formula we grew up with to so many different cultures? Rather than adapt, we can consider this question: how might we re-think the EAP formula as though it was as fresh as it was when it first appeared? Rethink it in Buenos Aires, in Johannesburg and Jakarta, in each case asking the question, \"What sort of EAP might we build there if we were starting afresh?\"As we were back in 1941. CHAPTER FOUR: THE NEWLY-MiNreo EAP We have already said that the answer to the question of the essential nature of EAP relates more to what was happening in 1941 than at any other time, and there are two parts to it: (1) the characteristics of the prototype provider, and (2) the nature of the problem addressed. (1) Who in the first place was the shadowy figure of all those years ago, the prime mover of the early EAP, the very first EAP specialist who made such a difference to so many American companies in the early 1940's and for many more years afterwards? What was it about him (it probably was a \"he\")that made him genuinely original and creative? The answer to this part of the question is threefold; (1) he worked on the shop floor as a shop floor worker\u2014one of the very first examples of his kind refused an office in the Medical Department; (2) he understood the link between a specific physical and/or psychological condition and performance; and (3) his own contribution was embedded in existing union, management and training structures. The missing ingredient \u2014a specialist resource \u2014wasn't really missing, It was freely available locally. In 1938 there were only a handful of AA chapters; by 1943 there were 10,000. (2) After the nature and skills of the provider,the second component of the equation (the nature of the problem) opens up a new set of questions: why alcohol? (and not something else); why then? (was there something special about that moment in history?);and why Dupont? Or Eastman Kodak? (Was there something special about US manufacturing at that particular point in time?) We need answers to these questions because most of the expansion in EAP delivery is still to come. Qtherwise, \"Lost in Translation\" could be the next part of the EAP story. With the exception of South Africa (with by chance a long history of EAP in the mining industry) and Australia (thanks to government subsidy in the 1970s and which originated oddly enough in a financial co-operative), the EAP concept is still relatively new and unexplored outside North America and the UK. We need to be cautious therefore in checking if the significant factors that influenced the USA EAP of the 1940s were relevant and just possibly relevant only to that period, to that place and time, not necessarily to any other. Likewise, we need to be wary of an assumption that any other single shape to an EAP can be understood as lending itself to some immutable form of EAP provision. After all,theearliest formula itself had already been genetically modified by the time the authors of the Core Technology raised their voices. As we saw above, the success of the UK EAP shows clearly that the EAP is nat simply a vinestock which transplants smoothly into other climates and soils. It is perhaps better to think of it as a cola, brewed and distributed locally anywhere in the world\u2014 perhaps with different added flavors\u2014but recognizable as cousin to EAP in every other part of the world because of the common ingredient or formula it carries. In this case it couldn't be counterfeited, since people everywhere would recognize the unmistakable components. The metaphor of a cola allows me to say one more thing. If we don't understand the genuine article then people can and will put anything in the bottle and call it EAP.That is already happening in parts of the world where the EAP label bears no relation to whaYs in the bottle. In those places EAP is not a profession with standards of delivery, but a brand. No more than a brand, an un-monitored, uncontrolled brand at that, which is a dangerous situation for us all to be in. 10 Incidentally we haven't been talking thus far of standards. Standards of performance only come once it is known what needs to be measured and assessed. I would find it hard to argue that we have yet defined with sufficientciaritythe generic factors which make EAP unique, which set it apart from any other Form of employee support and which are the foundation of a profession whose accredited practitioners know something or can do something that no one else can, and who can be relied on to act in accordance with agreed standards. The four fundamental aspects of the original EAP saw it characterized as (1) a worksite -based service; (2) the territory of an individual with the clinical knowledge to understand a behavior problem as such and link it with its impact on performance; (3) the domain of an individual who is a good resource investigator and who (4) ties in his/her work with existing corporate systems. These four are the essence of a process. But what of the content? Wouldn't and shouldn't the content be designed to meet the needs of the organization, of each organization in each place, in any specific period of time' It doesn't need to be alcohol then, does it? Or any other kind of chemical addiction, as it did back then? There could be other kinds of problems, couldn't there? One would expect there to be different problems of singular importance to other employers and employees in other situations and at other times? Psychological problems, problems with people and problems affecting productivity. But at that moment of time in the USA there was no more pressing an organizational problem than an alcohol- addicted worker. This was a personal problem mapping perfectly onto a core organizational requirement, and in this case a situation of national importance. An apparently miraculous solution to such circumstances was quickly adopted, showed its mettle and was welcomed by unions and management alike. The second half of the argument follows Iogically.The prototype EAP may well be replicated as far as possible among the four elements of process. The content however will vary from situation to situation and from culture to culture. Its content will conform to the same formula, namely, that an EAP determines its primary targets in accordance with an organizational (and sometimes general social) concern which lies at a crossover point with a specific individual psychological problem that the EAP provider has the skills to address. So...South Africa... india...Argentina...China...the situation and the dominant critical individual, corporate and social problem will be different every time, whether it is sickness absence, parental distress, growing suicide statistics, AIDS, domestic violence or anything else. To take only the emerging industrial giants of China and India as examples, the speed at which tens and hundreds of thousands (millions ?) of people are coming into employment at the same time in the context of cultures still creaking into m the relevant gear is having a dramatic impact on family life and social relationships,The same circumstances are equally dramatically changing relationships at work, often in the context of a rapidly emerging management class with little experience or formal training. In these circumstances an EAP consultancy might well offer a different mix of EAP support services to its corporate clients. Budgets will be important of course, which means that, in terms of priority and cultural fit, the need fora 24-hour telephone help desk may have to wait and give way first to a set of training courses for managers. That's what might make it the perfect EAP for those times and places. But that's not where discussion about the modern EAP typically begins. We usually begin with employees' mental health needs.Then we enquire what else we can add to the old formula \u2014a spot of career counselling? A brighter, shinier critical incident service,a bit of consultancy here and there. We have become so painfully inured to our role as mere providers that we have adopted some of the habits of the insurance or vacuum salesperson, suppressing the urge to design a new service altogether, a service more aligned to the cust'omer's actual corporate needs at that moment. This switch in thinking means an EAP doesn't start simply with a psychological problem to which it already has a solution, it begins with an organizational issue to which it doesn't necessarily have an immediate, ready-made solution, though it will by definition be a psychological (people) problem calling for quite similar skills to address it. The tension that has always existed between Performance and Health as the principal objective of EAP intervention is ultimately resolved in this way by adding the Business focus which may favor Performance atone time and Health at another, Nor are performance and productivity issues all health issues.The reader can see how cautiously the argument is edging towards the heretical conclusion that EAP isn't tied inevitably to healthcare. The vocabulary of EAP provision changes with this perspective.7hetarget employee changes from \"impaired \"or\"troubled\" or\"vulnerable \"to...what employee \"at risk':At riskfrom the organization and in turn a risk to the organization. \"Risk Management \"will continue to grow as a core theme of the 21st century. It is the other side of the coin from the overworked cliche that each employee is a unique asset.To the extent that each employee is an asset, he or she is a risk just as the original employee of 1941 was also an \"at risk\" individual, at risk to himself and a risk to the organization. In our own time the corporate environment of the new millennium is full of risk in a way it has never been before, cascad- ingfrom the global risks of endlessly challenging competifiion where there is no longer any such thing as a closed market, and of the continuing and pernicious risk of terrorist attack, and onto a whole new set of organizational risks not the least of which is cyber-fraud. At the end of the line come behavioral risks\u2014the actions and behavior of individuals, from poor self healthcare habits to Internet abuse. It was not so many years ago that an employee who wanted to steal from his employer had to carry it out to his car. Now he can make his organization suffer simply by taking his brain elsewhere. 12. On the other side of the equation the organization is in turn a much greater risk to the employee than ever before, even if it is only because its decision -makers need to be ever more fleet-footed to stay afloat in their own market. That means a terrible risk to the employee's continuing employment.The old psychological contract is dead where the employee would more or less \"do his best\"and the employer would more or less guarantee lifelong employment while his pension or the .State would take care of his relatively short years of retirement. That contract has been torn up and so far nothing so coherent has taken its place. In the past the risk that most organizations were alert to was the risk of physical danger to individual employees from defective machinery, poor maintenance and inadequate health and safety practices. At the beginning of the third millennium risks to and from the employee are much more subtle, ubiquitous, varied and numerous. Who the \"at risk\" employees are (at risk to themselves and a risk to their employer) could include any of the following, depending on the organization, on the current business environment and on--the kind of workforce employed. A considered Return On Investment calculation might include any of them, should they be \"damaged \": Employees with debt and money management problems Frequent flyers Accident victims Terror victims Potential suicide victims Employees in conflict Employees involved in workplace violence Employees involved in domestic violence Drug and alcohol users Employees involved in Internet pornography Employees involved in Internet gambling Employees involved in Internet shopping fraudsters Saboteurs Employees too prematurely introduced into the management class Employees who represent exceptional human capital This is far from an exhaustive list but these are all employees who could be placed at that same crossover point where psychological issues of danger/risk to the individual intersect with danger/risk to the organization, and possibly with national and social risk too. 13 STING IN THE TAIL Merely by way of illustration, we will assume that we are answering the question of where we would put our major effort as a brand new EAP service in 2005, unencumbered by history, as eager as our forefathers were in 1941 to meet an urgent and important need. We wilt suppose that employees who abuse the Internet (not alcohol) are our target population, with the full agreement of our corporate customer. Does that match the first requirement that such employees reside at the intersection of a serious problem for themselves and a serious problem for the business? Yes, it does.Coincidentally, it also carries the same distinction between abuse and addiction with reference to alcohol. There are useful and relevant statistics available these days in the UK, the US and elsewhere. Disciplinary cases for e-mail and Internet abuse at work in the last 12 months exceeded those for dishonesty, violence and health &safety breaches put together (PersonnelToc~ay) 49% of people manage their finances for an average of 13 minutes every day from the office (Halifax Sharebuilder Index) A quarter of UK firms have dismissed employees for Internet misconduct, with' 69% of those firings associated with online pornography 70% of all Internet porn traffic occurs during the 9-to-5 workday (SexTracker) 37.1 o/o of employees said they surf the Web constantly at work, 31.9% said a few times a day, 21.3% said a few times a week, and only 9.7%said never (Vault.com 2002) 1 in 5 men and 1 in 8 women admitted using their work computers as their primary lifeline to access sexual explicit material online (MSNBC 2002) There are any number of similar findings from numerous studies. Internet abuse all by itself can package any or all of three addictions (sexual, shopping and gambling), each of them as potentially pernicious as alcohol ever was and still is, as dangerous to its \"consumers';as costly to the addict's employer, and every bit as much of a social hazard as addictive drinking was 60 years ago. This is not to say that all EAPs should immediately address themselves to abuse of Internet access and to the triple addictions of sexual, gambling and shopping stimulation; that is a decision which lies with the employer. it says rather that today's \"employee at risk\"anywhere in the world might well be different from his/her counterpart of 60 years ago. it might 14 or might not be primarily ahealth- related risk at all, but rather a behavioral risk.The EAP provider of 2005 will still be expert in relevant psychological and organizational matters, will resemble its genetic ancestor of all those years ago in its core practice, and be clearly recognizable as a true representative of the Once and Future EAP. THIRD AND FINAL PROPOSITION The intersection of individual weakness (the individual at risk) and threat or risk to and from the organization is the most natural and important focal point of EAP intervention in any country in the world, at any moment in time. It has been noted that many of these employees who are a risk to themselves and a risk to the employer are not primarily candidates for mental health services. The array of problems presented by the employee to the employer were indeed originally mental health problems.The target employee then was \"impaired\" or \"troubled; and it appears that in the USA once the EAP movement was adopted (hijacked ?) by the healthcare community its future (fate?) was determined (forever ?).Any employee support mechanism can maximize its ber~cfir.i~l, impzct or '\"~<~ o!~ ~~,?ration at three levels:the systemic, the preventive and the remedial..Today's EAP is perceived and even sells itself primarily at the remedial level, wrapped as it often is in the mantle of Managed Care. CONCLUSION We have maintained that: 1,The target area for EAP attention and intervention lies at the crossover point between psychological and behaviora risk at the individual level, and risk to and from the organization. 2. An EAP intervention can take place at three levels: the systemic, the preventive and/or the remedial. An EAP should regard itself as competent at all three levels and should attempt to change its profile as predominantly remedial. The systemic (consultant) role thus replaces the \"sales\" role. 3.The target employee will vary from employer to employer. Any one of the following short list could represent the most vulnerable subset of a workforce at any one time. Frequent travellers Long-term sick Victims of (psychological) violence individuals with particularly poor health habits Internet porn surfers Internet gamblers Carers A consultative exploration with any single corporate customer would probably double or triple this. list, then prioritize it, and single out one or more points of attack on the basis of urgency and/or importance. 15 In no way should the argument of this paper be construed as a criticism of providers or a downgrading of what they are providing and have provided to the nation over many, many years.Over the half century of its lifetime the EAP industry must have saved billions of dollars more than it has cost either the State or the employer, but it now doesn't have enough to say at the systemic level. It doesn't even fully leverage the benefits of the management information it garners every day of the week, which is where Finance Directors and CEOs Iive.The very modesty of the EAP, its humble acceptance of its role at the bottom of the supply chain, is what leaves it vulnerable. And it seems fated to stay there, scrambling for its share of crumbs from the mighty budgets allocated to healthcare in the modern USA. Unless, that is, it can reclaim its place as consultant as well as suppliertb its customers, THE- EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE EUROPEAN FORUM (EAEF) AND ITS ROLE IN THE EMERGING EA MARKET IN CONTINENTAL EUROPE BY RICHARD HOPKINS INTRODUCTION In response to the development of EA in continental Europe, the Employee Assistance European Forum (EAEFj was formally constituted in March 2004. Its primary purpose is to promote the highest standards of practice and continuing development of EA professionals, providers and services in Europe.lts key aims include the development and enforceability of Standards of Practice and Codes of Ethics for the profession the provision of networking and learning opportunities for its members and the promotion of effective EA work amongst potential purchasers, related professional bodies and public policy makers. Although the EAEF is a young organization, it.already has ~i;: s3.!n~ort of Svc `? ~ f ~;~'~~fessionals from over 15 European countries. lts intent is to build on this to become the respected and influential voice of EA in Europe. CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH The Employee Assistance (EA) field is in its early stages in Europe, confined to isolated pockets of development in most countries in Europe--the major exceptions being the UK and Ireland.This does not mean, however, that EA-style work is not being done in continental Europe. Occupational social workers have long provided support services for employees, particularly in northern European countries, It merely means that their work is not necessarily recognized, even by themselves, as related to more structured EA work, notably in the form of EAPs. Experience suggests that one or both of two conditions lead to the development of EA in any, particular market.These are the influence of primarily US-based multinationals and/or a tradition for providing welfare support services for employees. Mare recently,the role of EU public policy makers has also become a key determinant in how soon an EA market develops. In the UK, the most developed market in Europe, US multinationals kick started the development in the early 80s against a background of along-standing welfare tradition. More recently, Government initiatives and legal action have increasingly focussed organizational attention on the business risks involved in failing to provide effective support for their people.This includes the provision of EA. In Ireland, multinationals have been less of an influence.lnstead, for many years, larger public and private sector employers have been providing internal support services for their employees. Elsewhere in Europe, multinationals and pan-European organizations have only just begun to exert an influence. This, combined with the welfare tradition in many Western European countries and, more recently, the recognition by EU policy makers that a healthy workplace makes for a wealthier community, has led to the beginnings of more substantive growth in EA provision.This is not only in the 25 current EU members but also in those applying to join and others, including Russia. 17 THE ROLE OF THE EAEF Against this background, a meeting of 24 EA practitioners from 14 different European countries took place in Wiesbaden, Germany in September 2002. The meeting was also attended by representatives of the EAPA. At this meeting it was recognized that a pan European voice for EA was needed to help guide and support the successful and professional development of effective EA work. At a further meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark in May 2003, attended by over 35 delegates, it was agreed that a Steering Group. would be formed. The Steering Group was charged with the task of developing a constitution for what has now become the EAEF. At the 3rd Annual EAEF Conference in Athens in March 2004, over 50 delegates formally adopted the Constitution and a Board of Directors was elected. The EAEF's mission is to be the European voice of employee assistancP.Jts primary purpose is to promote the highest standards of practice and continuing development of EA professionalS;providersand services in Europe. The EAEF has eight.principalarms: To define the competencies and boundaries of EA provision To develop Standards of Practice, Codes of Ethics and enforceable compliance procedures To identify the accreditation needs of providers and adopt the most relevant and appropriate form of program /provider accreditation To identify and implement market relevant research programs To provide networking opportunities for EA professionals To develop communications programs to create/raise and maintain awareness for the scope and benefits of quality driven, market relevant EA work To influence public policy in relation to EA work To identify and guide the development of EA training and development programs for EA practitioners. Membership is open to all those who have an interest in EA work in Europe. All members are required to sign an undertaking to adhere to the EAEF's Code of Ethics and to the EAEF's Employee Assistance European Guidelines.These Guldelineswere developed following an extensive review of standards of practice from all over the world (Masi, 2003). These were then distilled down to the key essentials required when providing EA in Europe.Their intent is to act as a starting point from which each country is then able to develop its own guidelines,tailored to its own particular needs as its market develops. Equally, they are available as a guide for potential purchasers, related professional bodies and EU and national policy makers. To be respected, a professional body needs to be able to add exclusive value for its membership.lt is the intent of the EAEF to develop an effective and enforceable means of ensuring that its members adhere to its Constitution, Code of Ethics and fE3 Guidelines, Achieving this is crucial to the maintenance of high quality standards,as the market in each country develops. The EAEF also sets out as one of its aims identifying ways in which training can be provided for existing EA professionals and equally important for those new to the profession.The Certified Employee Assistance Professional (CEAP) credential, if were to be truly internationalized enough to become widely accepted could have a role to play for existing professionals. (For more information on the CEAP visit www.eap- association.org ).The EAP modules being offered by some Universities, notably the National University of Ireland in Galway with the support of EAPA Ireland, offer models far other training institutions,The EAEF has a role to play in encouraging their development. REACHING OUT An important part of the work being done by the EAEF is the formation of close relationships with related professional bodies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).The EU has in the past and continues to undertake various healthy workplace initiatives.These include EU Commissii~n's Glaidanc:^ on 1~~ork R.e:l~~~d Stress (2000), the Barcelona Declaration on Developing Good Workplace Health Practice (2002) and the stress related absenteeism work being done by the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work and the European Network Workplace Health Promotion (ENWHP).These have led to an increasing recognition by employers that it makes good organizational sense to reduce stress in the workplace, As they take a more holistic approach to achieving a healthier workplace, policies are developed and implemented aimed at improving the health of employees.These have,traditionally,related tophysical health.lncreasingly, they now relate to their mental health. EA professionals throughout Europe have the opportunity to capitalize on these developments through the provision of high quality EA. This supports employees but also through the provision of a range of related performance management services, adds value to organizations. The challenge for EA professionals in Europe, as it is elsewhere in the world, is to persuade their customers to work with them to provide a combination of these two key elements to provide optimum value. Failure to achieve this leads, as it has done in the US, the UK and elsewhere, to the dumbing down of services to the point of commoditization. Through its membership and activities,the EAEF has a significant role to play in helping to prevent this from happening in continental Europe or, at the very least, to delay the erosion of service quality and effectiveness for as long as possible.

An economic recession took hold from1998 through 2001. The recession deepened after the government collapsed in alte 2001 because of a grave political crisis. The crisis, together with the declaration of default in foreign debt announced by the new authorities, aggravated economic conditions. The following graph illustrates the drop in .National Gross Product over the years 1998 through 2002. Figure 7. Gross Product 1 +'~ ~3 ~ 1''~~~r'!~ ~ ~p Cl~1 ~~ ~l'~M ~ ~ I~~ Provisional data, up to the third quarter last year, indicate a change in trend and a growth of 7% in the economy. This previous economic decline has strongly affected the unemployment level, with an important drop in the employment index, particularly from the beginning of 2002, as evidenced in the chart hereunder: 21 Figure 2. Employment Level During the year, 2003 a slight improvement was apparent, stimulated by the change in the economic trend. Unemployment allied to the impact caused by the sudden devaluation of the Argentine peso during 2002 affected the price of food and essential consumer articles, causing an increase in the poverty indexes; these indexes reached unprecedented historical values. The following graph illustrates the growth of the number of persons (in the main Argentine urban centers) who live below the line of poverty. Figure 3. People Below the Poverty Line (Main Cities) 22 The impact of political uncertainty, bank savings accounts frozen with a loss of part of the accounts, the accelerated drop in activity levels and the increase in unemployment created a state of impending danger. This situation generated favorable conditions for a strong growth in stress among massive population sectors.The stress has become apparent in an increase of persons seeking the services of mental health specialists for treatment of anxiety disorders, panic attacks, depression, sleep disorders and other pathologies. STATUS OF EAPS As of 2000, Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) have started to be adopted in accordance with international standards. Before 2000, assistance services already existed, performed by Social Welfare Assistants. These services generally were in-house support services provided by employees of the contracting companies. Such services are usually complemented with medical assistance and, in exceptional cases; psychological assistance is also offered. Although no standards have bPr~r ion*e,~ for this purpose, guidelines have been developed according to company needs. - At present there are several companies in Argentina who have contracted EAP services together with work-life programs, according to the EAPA standards.These companies generally had EAPs already implemented in their head offices and the progressive application of the same to their operations in other countries in the world integrates their policies. The impact of the political economic and social crisis on companies generating mass layoffs and restructures, has led local management to be more sensitive to the need fen services offering emotional support and psychological counseling for. employees and their relatives. The market has started to consider Employee Assistance Programs useful tools to help Human Resources management face demands and problems presented by their personnel regarding situations that did not exist a few years back. Certain segments, such as the Banks, required special psychological support when the Government froze the savings deposited by investors. At that time the public expressed their animosity with aggressive and, in some cases, almost violent behavior, targeting the bank premises and in some cases the bank employees, However; when promoting the EAPs during these years, a negative factor has been the companies' budget restrictions. Although the demand existed, triggered by the crisis,the crisis itself originated losses for the companies, therefore causing a shortage of available funds for financing the EAPs. The change in the economic trend which occurred in the year 2003 enables companies to resort to financial resources available for investment in these types of programs. In short, the market is starting to become acquainted with EAP's; EAP's are being contracted mainly by companies who use them within the scope of their Head Once policies. Bearing in mind the incipient recovery in the Argentine economy, it is possible to envisage a growth in demand for these programs in future. 23 CURRENT ISSUES IN EAPS The types of inquiries and services required have varied according to the different periods through which our country was passing.Threedifferent stages may be observed: 1. Prior to the economic political crisis of December 2001; 2. During the crisis, from December 2001 up to the first months of the year 2003; 3.The second half-year of the year 2003. During the stages which preceded the crisis the most frequent consultation issues related to indebtedness, mortgage loans and loss of jobs. During the crisis, because of changes in legislation and new rules in the economic game, the recurrent issues included stress, legal consultations, and economic -financial consultations.Once the worst moments of the crisis were behind us,an increase occurred in consultations regarding Psychological Counseling and psychiatric disorders. In general, one might safely state that currently work-life consultations constitute the majority; exceeding 50%, and within these the most frequent ones are related to legal issues. The variety of topics is ample but the most significant subjects cover Family Rights, and Consumer and Property Protection. The modification of private contracts by new legislation has generated legal uncertainty, which is still reflected in the consultations which employees present. In the case of Psychological Counseling,the prevailing themes are advice on family, marriage and couples. Both during and after the crisis, the demand increased for workshops on Stress Management and Managing Transitions. The impact of the crisis and the uncertainty which it generated, as well as its effect on business, (evident in dismissals, re-organizations, mergers, closures, and transfer of firms) acted as stress-promoting, factors which reinforced the demand for these types of workshops.

IYs roughly the size of North America, but has a very small population of some 20 million people.The population of Australia is mainly located around the coastal areas, with some 70% of people residing in cities. Australia is a very multicultural society originating from about 200 different countries. The provision of services such as EAPs is not that difficult, as the population tends to be concentrated in the larger cities along the coastline. The history of EAPs in Australia dates back to 1976, when the Federal Government, in response to alcohol and substance abuse in the workplace, formed the National Alcohol and Drug Dependence Industry Committee (NADDIC) to develop and implement Occupational Drug and Alcohol programs. The committee was made up of a tripartite representing unions, employers and the government. Senior representatives from the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), the Confederation of Australian Industry (CAI), and the Alcohol and Drug Foundation of Australia were selected for the committee. Funded by the federal government, agencies were setup in each state/territory to address alcohol and other J drug problems in the workplace.Consultants in each state of Australia began encouraging employers to implement joint labor/management alcoholism programs.This initiative was not terribly successful as services were not in place to backup the policies and procedures. By the mid 1980's, NADDIC had changed its name to the EAP Council of Australia and EAPs in Australia were born. The initial EAP services were designed to assist employees where personal orwork -related problems were affecting their work performance.The programs quickly became'broad brush'and were designed to deal with wider mental health issues beyond drug and alcohol problems. The initial EAPs generally included Manager /Supervisor briefings /training, stress management programs, AIDS education, consulting, etc.The consultants providing services through these programs were generally Psychologists, Social Workers and in some instances Chaplains. The first EAP Association established in Australia was an Australia chapter of EAPA, followed in 1991 by the establishment of another EAP association known as the Employee Assistance Professional Association of Australia. RELATIONSHIPS OF AUSTRALIAN EAPS TO THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM Australia enjoys the benefits of a sound health care system including publicly funded and private hospitals, community mental health services, and extensive allied health programs delivering services that are accessible Australia -wide. Whilst these services have focused predominantly on physical health and acute psychiatric care,there has been historically a sig- nificant gap in services delivery around psychological health (non-psychiatric mental health needs) and family support ~: services. Generally, there is a perception in Australia that people suffering mild forms of common psychological distress (the working well) do not have ready access to short term, psychology- 'based counselling support. Fortunately, within this area, Australian EAPs have been able to deliver services to help redress this shortfall. Limited legislation exists within the various hierarchies of Australian government to make provision of EAPs compulsory. However, federal and state guidelines strongly. encourage employers to provide access for government employees to confidential counselling support. Increasingly, private sector organizations are recognizing that to attract and retain talented and productive employees they need to have access to appropriately professional and responsive EAP services. In the past five years a trend has developed towards the inclusion of EAPs as part of Union-Employer Agreements (Enterprise Bargaining Agreements) within Australia's Industrial Relations system. STATUS OF EAPS - Fifteen to twenty years ago in Australia, EAPs predominantly existed in response to calls for drug and alcohol counselling. Whilst there was little actual data to support these calls,trade unions,a number of church groups and employer organizations collaborated to develop quasi-support offerings that provided an initial introduction of EAP's to Australian industry. Over the years EAPs have continued to develop, evolve and mature. In the past five years, EAP service delivery has been much more focused on delivering evidence -based interventions that draw significantly onwell- established psychological tenets and contemporary systems theory. This allows a healthy merger of best practice psychology and clinical social work interventions, EAPs in Australia typically are delivered independently of any other physical health/insurance services that employers may offer to their employees. Furthermore, employee health programs, managed health care and other US-style employee benefits have been not widely embraced in Australia and are not being introduced. Additionally, unions have tended, to have less of a role in the coordination or management of programs directly,but continue to support the availability of EAPs for their members.These gradual refinements and the maturing of the EAP industry in Australia stem from a level of openness, collegiate support -and healthy competition that exists, largely speaking, across the whole industry. As a nation, Australia has tended to enjoy healthy competition, collegiate commitment to professional development and an interest in fair play that has spilled over to EAP service work. CURRENT MODELS Although there are variations and subsets within the following outline, EAPs in Australia exist across a broad clinical spectrum.One end features service provision that typically has had a pastoral or religious underpinning,This often involves regular worksite visits and attendance to provide brief, informal discussions, delivered by a'counselor' walking around at the work place; employees get some sense of being cared for in a pastoral or nurturing sense. 27 Progressing along the continuum, some EAPs are delivered internally by individuals predominantly with some form of mental health training. However, the prevalence of \"Internal Programs\" has decreased .markedly in the last 10 years, with only a small number of these remaining. Even in industries that held onto Internal Programs for cultural reasons for many years, such as Police Services, most have moved to External Programs. The most common EAP delivery model now in Australia utilizes an external EAP Provider with clinical psychologists or clinically trained social workers under well-established protocols, evidence -based methodologies and according to strict quality-control systems. Typically, an Australian EAP integrates other important dimensions of'people support' with the EAP'clinical' /counselling service.These include a Management Consultation service, Organizational consulting on people issues, and aTrauma /crisis response and management service (not necessarily following the CISD approach.) CURRENT ISSUES IN AUSTRALIAN EAPS A number of issues confront EAPs in Australia. The major trend facing both providers and host organizations revolves around the ongoing dilemma of cost versus quality. Increasingly, the Australian psychology and social work professions have been focusing on the necessity of post-graduate qualification, heightened requirements for ongoing professional development, peer review, and evidence -based accountability in service delivery. Whilst historically an employer was happy for anon-qualified lay person to \"have a chat' with any distressed or troubled employee, the legal needs for appropriate assessment, diagnosis and effective intervention or referral in medicolegal contest has determined that EAPs lift their game and deliver high quality and accountable services. Therefore, it's become more expensive and more challenging to attract and retain quality clinicians and managers to deliver and coordinate these services. Additionally, employees and companies are becoming more discerning about what constitutes quality evidence -based interventions and are more attuned to service provision that delivers lasting outcomes while contributing to retention and morale.As companies and organizations merge and become larger,the need to deliver EAPs that have the capacity to meet specific needs and tailor interventions for particular workgroups is becoming increasingly apparent. Pricing is another concern facing Australian EAPs. In the last few years, a number of psychology or social work practitioners have entered the EAP market and have been attempting to capture new work with little or no margin. Unsuspecting hosf organizations have engaged these companies only to find their services cannot be sustained and quality is not as promised. Balancing quality and cost will continue to be a major issue for Australian EAPs. The introduction of web-based information and support, services has added a new dimension to EAPs in Australia.The general consensus is that,whilethese provide a certain type and level of'assistance; the web based services 28 can not stand alone and should always be part of a broader based program with quality telephone and face-to-face interventions and consultations as a central core of an EAP. The issue of accountability and provision of evidence -based services will be a major issue in Australian -based EAPs. Increasingly, host organizations will want to see that their dollar spent is recouping significant rewards for their organization, The profession as a whole is starting to seriously embrace initiatives and mechanisms to track, report and gauge effectiveness of interventions.This, inturn, will lead to even greater acceptance and appreciation of EAPs in Australia, EAPs have proven very successful in Australia by integrating the Organizational and Human Resources dimension along with the individual clinical/counselling dimension, EAPs are well accepted and utilized as part of an effective, people- performance support strategy by Australian organizations, in both the Public and Private sectors. This continues to drive EAP service innovation and accountability.

Two main language communities live side by side within Belgium: the Dutch-speaking Flemish people in the north, and the French-speaking Walloons in the south of the country. Although the centrally situated capital, Brussels, is bilingual, there are more French-speakers there. In the eastern part of the country there is also a small German -speaking community. Thanks to its central location, Belgium serves as a springboard to the European Union. its neighbors are France, Luxemburg, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Brussels is the capital of Europe; it is the site of the headquarters of the European Commission the Council of Ministers, and the European Parliament.Other rnajorinternational organizations, such as NATO, are also located in Brussels. As a result, Brussels is, the number two city in the world (after Washington) in terms of its number of accredited journalists, and fourth in terms of the number of international meetings and seminars held there. POLITICS Belgium became independent in 1830 and has had a complex three-level federal state structure since 1993. At the top level are the Federal State, the Communities, and the Regions, all three of which are equal from a legal viewpoint but. have powers and responsibilities for different fields. There are three Communities:the Flemish Community,the French Community and the German -speaking Community.They are based on the language of their population and have autonomy in matters with regard to language, culture, education, areas of healthcare, etc.There are an equal number of Regions: the Flemish Region, the Brussels- ~apifal Region and the Walloon Region. They are based on geographical areas and have autonomy in territorial matters such as economy and foreign trade, agriculture and environment, employment, etc. Before the institutional reforms of 1970,1980, 1988-89 and 1993 the decision -making power in Belgium was exclusively in the hands of the Federal Government and the Federal Parliament. Now, with the complex three-level federal state, the management of the country falls to several partners.They exercise their competences independently in difFerent fields.The federal state retained important areas of competence including foreign affairs, defense, justice, finances, social security, important sectors of public health and domestic affairs. 30 ECONOMY In 2000, Belgium's gross domestic product (GOP) was EUR 244 billion, or 2.9% of the EU's total GDP. Belgium accounts for 1% of the EU's total surface area and 2.7% of its population. Productivity, and.therefore material prosperity, is higher in Belgium than. in the rest of Europe. In 2000, per capita income was EUR 62,560, 20%above the EU average. Belgium is a developed economy, where services account for 67.1% of GDP. Over the last 10 years Belgium has had real economic annual growth of 2,1%, compared to 2,0% for the EU as a whole. Over the same period, prices have risen modestly in Belgium with average inflation of 1.9%,compared to 2.8%for the EU, On the other hand, Belgium's performance is less positive in terms of public finances, with ahigh \u2014but currently decreasing \u2014public debt/GDP ratio (110.6% in 2000). Furthermore, like most European countries, Belgium has a high rate of unemployment (8.6% of the active population was unemployed it 2000L Belgium is a very open economy. Exports of goods and services accounted for nearly 76.5% of GDP in 1999, and imports nearly 73%. By way of comparison the European average was almost 32.2% for exports and nearly 31 % for imports.ln 1999, the total value of exports was EUR 186.7 billion, Even though the share of services in trade relations is growing rapidly, around 70% of Belgian exports and imports still involve goods. This trade focuses very much on the European market. Half the goods exported by Belgium are sold in neighboring countries (Germany, France and the Netherlands), while one quarter go to other EU member states. Imports follow the same pattern, more or Iess.This situation reflects Belgium's role as a hub within the EU. SOCIAL SECURITY The Belgian social security system is the result of several evolutions during the past 150 years. The basic concept underlying the system is solidarity between the different groups in society. The social security system is guaranteed because working people have to pay social security contributions based on their salary, and the system is largely financed by he community. The trade unions, health insurance funds and the employers' organizations decide about the various aspects of the system. The social security system contains seven sectors: old age and survivor's pensions, unemployment, insurance for accidents atwork,insuranceforprofessional disease,familybenefits,sicknessand disability insurance and annual vacation.The social security system intervenes in the event of wage loss where a substitution income is obtained. This includes situations in which one has to bear speci~c'social charges,'such as raising children or sickness -related costs. Here, people receive a supplement to their income. Another intervention occurs when people, independent of their own will, don't have a professional income.ln these cases assistance allowances are given. 31 SOCIAL CONSENSUS The National Labor Council (for social matters) and the Central Economic Council (for economic matters) are the umbrella organizations wherein an equal number ofinter- professional trade union organizations and inter-professional employers' organizations are represented. The bargaining process between the different social partners is conducted at three different levels: the company, branch or sector, and national, Most of these committees have an advisory task in order to avoid conflicts at the company level. Essentially, the communication channels enable the conclusion of inter-professional collective Labor agreements within the National Labor Council. STATUS OF EAPS In contrast to the abundance of statistics on the prevalence of EAPs in Anglo-Saxon countries such as the US or the UK, there is a complete absence of statistics on the prevalence of EAPs in Belgium.This lack of objective data makes it difficult to make any quantitative statements on the current status of the EAPs. However, much can be learned from a qualitative approach using the product life cycle and from the analysis of the legal framework.The product life cycle shows the stages that products go through from development to withdrawal from the market. There are many indicators that help us conclude the EAP is in the introduction stage of its life cycle. The EAP provision seems characterized by low sales, high cost per customer, and negative profits.The pioneer customers are primarily inter- nationalcompanies with local branches. Large local companies with 500+ employees are following the lead of their inter- nationalcolleagues, but at a slower pace.There are hardly any small business users. Examples of international organizations having an EAP are Cisco Systems, DuPont, Exxon, Honeywell, Levi-Strauss and Procter &Gamble. Examples of local compa- nies that have an EAP are Delacre, InBev, Mobistar and Solvay. The term \"employee assistance program\" is known by few people, even though local EAP providers \u2014consistent with the positioning of the EAP in the introductory phase of the product life cycle\u2014have tried to create product awareness by organizing or participating in symposia. However, marketing activities seem limited in nature and are often more on the sideline of events. Examples of events in 2003-2005 were: The Symposium on Quality of Working Life in December 2003, This symposium was' organized by the foundation 32 King Baudouin in collaboration with Prevent and the ISW. A report called \"My life, my work\" was presented, in which two organizations briefly mentioned their EAP as part of their measures oriented at obtaining a good work-life balance. The Symposium on Addiction at Work in March 2004. This symposium was organized by PreBes, an organization of Health and Safety consultants operating on the regional Ievel.A speaker from ICAS presented the combination of an alcohol and drugs policy with an EAP in several large companies. The Symposium on 5lress &Employability in January 2005. This symposium was organized by Prevent, in collaboration with Eupora Counseling Services. A speaker for Global Services FGI presented the concept of an EAP. EAP programs differ in their use of in-house and external staff; in their range of services, and in other factors. For example, Solvay has an internal EAP aimed primarily at employees' alcohol- dependency problems. DuPont has an external EAP addressing issues including social, financial, family, emotional ar~d physical concerns. Some EAPs focus solely on work related stress while others include family problems. There are also differences with regards to the orientation of the program to the individual employee or to the organization, the latter being crucial for effectively dealing with the outcomes of a possible lack of fit between the worker and his or her conditions of work The number of EAP providers in Belgium is\u2014at the time of publishing \u2014quite limited, and each provider has its own characteristics: Only two local providers offer employee assistance programs while actually using the term EAP; Eupora Counseling Services BVBA (Eupora): Eupora, a division of Kaleido Consulting, a local Human Resources consultancy. bureau, was founded in December 2001 by .Mrs. B~n~dicte Taymans d'Eypernon, a clinical psychologist. The product portfolio of Eupora consists of one product, its employee assistance programs. ICAS Belgium NV (ICAS); ICAS Belgium is the Belgian office of the ICAS group. ICAS, established in 1987, is a worldwide provider of employee support and behavioral risk management services. ICAS has offices in more then 16 countries worldwide.The product portfolio of ICAS Belgium consists of employee assistance programs, crisis call services, audit and consultancy, conflict management, coaching and training, and expatriate services. Two other local providers do not explicitly use the term EAP while doing business but they are known to use the term occasionally: Insi[ituut voor Stress en Werk NV (ISW): spin-off of the KULeuven and de UCL, two universities based at Leuven, ISW was founded in 1998, end its portfolio is organized around four concepts: the ISW-model, ISW Prevent\u2014 Research & Diagnostics, ISW Prevent \u2014Interventions, and ISW Care. ISW sells employee assistance programs as part of the Care concept.The name Individual Counseling, rather than EAP, is used to describe the programs. 33 Insrituut voor Psychotrauma /Pobos NV (POBOS); POBOS was founded in 1993 as a division of a Dutch group called Schouten & Nelissen.The POBOS portfolio consists of training programs, trauma care, well-being care and social services. POBOS does not offer employee assistance programs but some of the services offered have similarities with certain EAP components. International EAP providers have found it difficult to start services in Belgium. One factor is the difference between the marketing needed in a mature market and in a market where the product is still in the introductory phase. Another factor involves the difficulty inspiring confidence while acknowledging the local culture and habits of a country yet offering services through a foreign call center. Of all international providers, only ICAS has a local office. Examples of international EAP providers in Belgium are; Employee Advisory Resources (EAR): EAR is a subsidiary of the Accor grroup and has been known to offer services on the Belgian territory. FGI: FGI is one of the leading Canadian providers of employee assistance programs and has been known to show interest in the Belgian territory. For example Mrs. Rensia Melles from FGI Global services has presented the concept of EAPs to the participants of a symposium in Belgium. ICAS Group Ltd: ICAS is one of the leading UK EAP-providers and is the only international EAP provider to offer services through a local office. EAP providers\u2014 ednsistent with the low sales, high cost per customer, and negative profits characterized by the introductory stage of the EAP\u2014are under high strain and may experience difficulties while trying to successfully implement their services in Belgium,This might be the reason why one provider has ended his activities: Corporate Caring Systems BVBA/SPRL, also known as International Human Capital Management BVBA/SPRL. Corporate Caring Systems has, unfortunately, ceased its activities as of November 2003. The head of the company was Konstantin Von Vlietinghoff- Scheel, an organizational psychologist well known in the EAP field. EAPS IN BELGIUM: A LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR WELL-BEING AT WORK Consistent with the EAP's place in the introductory phase of its life cycle, EAPs aren't regulated. There are no local organizations comparable to the Employee Assistance Professionals Association (EAPA) or the Employee Assistance Society of North America (EASNA) who provide information on the subject to the general public and monitor the quality of work of the EAP providers. The only EAP provider in Belgium recognized by an organization that specializes in EAP provisions is ICAS; the ICAS group is recognized as an international provider by the EAPA. However, there is no local chapter in Belgium. 34 As a consequence of the lack of supervising organizations, the professionalism and quality of EAP provision must be carefully determined by the EAP customer, EAP core elements may be used as tools in those evaluations. For example customers should consider a written policy statement,top management endorsement,union involvement where possible, program coordination, communication, trained supervisors, confidentiality, insurance coverage and program evaluation'. But other criteria can be used as well. For example, the ISW (a spin-off of the university KUL) has a number of university professors on their board who could contribute to the process. In spite of the absence of EAP-specific regulations, EAP\u2014providers and their contracting organizations need to take into account the different legislation on health and safety at work that are applicable in the Belgian territory. The most important legal framework on the European level is The European Council Directive 89/391 of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the,safety and health of workers at work'.The objective of the Directive is to ensure a higher degree of protection of workers at work through the implementation of preventive measures to guard against accidents at work and\"occupational diseases. The Directive also calls for information, consultation, balanced participation and training of workers and their representatives. Those measures should be implemented on the basis of a number of general principles of prevention, amongst others': avoiding risks evaluating the risks which cannot be avoided combating risks at source developing a coherent overall prevention policy which covers technology, organization of work, working conditions, social relationships and the influence of factors related to the working environment The European Council Directive 89/391 is transposed by the Belgian decree law of 4 August 1996, commonly referred to as the'well- being' law (de welzijnswet, la loi du bien-~tre).The Belgian Health &Safety legislation covered by the powers of the Federal State had already gone through substantial changes during the past decades. The 'well-being' law has consolidated these changes by introducing a shift from the traditional focus on classic health and safety risks to a holistic approach aimed at protecting and improving the well-being of employees \". In addition to the law, a number of implementing Royal Decrees have been passed. The three most important are the Royal Decree of 27/03/1998 concerning the policy on the well being of employees while at work,the Royal Decree of 27/03/1998 concerning the external service for prevention and protection at work, and the Royal Decree of 27/03/1998 concerning the internal service for prevention and protection at work, AREAS OF WORK There are roughly six areas of concern for organizations. Measures are legally required as far as four areas are concerned: 35 psychosocial strain at work violence, bullying and sexual harassment; work related stress and smoking,The two remaining areas, drug abuse/misuse and work-life balance, are not as clearly regulated as the other four. However, because of their immediate impact on the functioning of both the employee. and the organization, they have consolidated their place in the hierarchy of the employers' priorities. 1,Psychosocial strain at work: Psychosocial strain at work is one of the areas included in the health and safety domain by the decree law of 4 August 1996. As the concept \"psychosocial strain at work\" left too much open-ended, a Royal Decree was proposed to define the specific meaning. The decree was not passed but an inter-professional collective labor agreement has been reached defining the concept of work-related stress. 2. Violence, bullying and sexual harassment: A Royal Decree of 11/07/2002 regulates the protection of workers against violence, bullying and sexual harassment at work. The decree has raised vivid discussions among different social partners, especially on the possible misuse ofi the\"legal protection of possible victims of violence, bullying or sexual harassment against dismissal, 3,Work- related stress: An inter-professional collective labor agreement on the policy on stress prevention was reached within the National Labor Council on 30 March 1999.The agreement specifies what is meant by the concept stress, what the employer's obligations are regarding the preventive measures needed which organizations must be consulted in the process, and where to go in case the employer needs additional information. 4,Smoking: A new Royal Decree-will be implemented in January 2006.The decree will ban smoking at work. Employers will be obligated to ensure each worker can work, have a break, and have lunch in a smoke-free environment. This employee right to a smoke-free environment must also be situated within a global anti-smoking policy. 5. Drug abuse/misuse: There is no health and safety legislation that specifically refers to drug abuse or misuse, but it is part of good practice risk management to have a drug abuse/misuse policy. The role EAPs can play in managing drug abuse/misuse is unknown to all. 6. Work-life balance: No legislation specifically refers to work-life balance, but managing work-life balance is seen as part of goad practice people management. Many organizations have already taken multiple measures,such as workfrom home, part-timejobs, flexible working hours,\"concierge services;'satellite offices, etc. WORK METHODOLOGY Belgian and European legislation clearly states a primary prevention approach to have priority over a secondary or tertiary approach. in spite of this, both in the European Union and elsewhere, most work stress prevention .approaches are oriented towards secondary and tertiary prevention only. Employee assistance programs thus need to be both 36 employee- and organization -oriented to be able to deal with possible outcomes of the lack of fit between the worker and his or her conditions of work. Secondary and tertiary approaches are valuable as long as they constitute a part of a larger package that includes primary preventions. The measures taken to increase the well being and mental health of workers must also be based on a risk analysis, providing 'objective' data on the basis of which adequate measures can be taken, Data from an EAP (with individuals' anonymity guaranteed) can be a useful source of information, enabling an organization to identify 'high stress' departments or procedures and perhaps to plan organizational interventionsb. But these data are not sufficient from a legal point of view. An organization needs to regularly conduct audits and surveys gathering data on the whole population of workers, allowing measures specifically oriented at primary prevention.

Currently, at least 40 % of Bermudian household have access to EAP services.The incorporation of EAP's on this tiny island 770 miles off the United States coast came about through several developments that occurred starting in 1983 and 1984, The acting Governor of Bermuda, Viscount Dunrossil, commissioned H. David Archibald, a social worker, to establish the Royal Commission into the Use and Misuse of Illicit Drugs and Alcohol. The Commission's work focused on the following: 1.To inquire ir~,a ::l~~ ease asici m~:~usN e~';Il cit drugs and alcohol in Bermuda 2. To examine and determine through any investigations and studies the Commission may deem appropriate, the nature and extent of the use and misuse of illicit drugs and alcohol in Bermuda, and in particular: a.To examine and consider ways in which the community might participate in dealing with the problem b. To examine and consider ways of better coping with the supply and demand of illicit drugs. c. To examine and consider ways of improviny existing prevention, education, treatment and law enforcement programs. d. To examine and consider the personal, social, and economic costs of the misuse of illicit drugs and alcohol. 3.To report the finding of such inquiries and examinations, and to make such recommendations in relation thereto as the Commission shall think fit. Upon completion of the Commission's report, five reports were generated over the period 1984-1985.They include: 1,The Special Report on Education and Training 2,The Special Report on the Health and Social Consequences of Alcohol, Cannabis, Cocaine, and Heroin, Plus a Summary Statement on AIDS. 3.The Special Report on Treatment and Rehabilitation 4.The Special Report on the Justice System, Addressing International issues and Intervention, Plus the Justice System in Bermuda. S.The Special Report on Alcohol \u2014Its Impact in Bermuda. C~~] These reports were generated through a variety of methods, which included private and public hearings with members of the Bermuda community. Research included surveys of Bermuda secondary school students, students at the Bermuda College,and a telephone survey of people who reside in Bermuda.A street survey of drug addicts was also conducted and had significant impact on the creation of EAPs in Bermuda. The survey. question relating. to employment produced interesting data: forty-six (46) percent reported that they were employed full-time, forty-four (44) percent reported that they were employed part-time, and only ten (10) percent reported that they were unemployed.192 addicts participated in the survey, Unfortunately, Bermuda was seen as suffering from an enormous alcohol and drug problem.The Commission's report laid out a framework in the five reports for tackling the problems that exist in Bermuda.The Special Report on Treatment and Rehabilitation (Part 11 Chapter 8,Pre-Treatment Programs for Alcoholics) recommended that: 1. High priority be given to the development of EAP programs. 2.The programs focus not only on alcoholism but also on problems of drug abuse and mental health. 3.The program be planned and developed indirect collaboration with Alcoholism Services, Addiction Services, the Chamber of Commerce, the Bermuda Council on Alcoholism, and selected representatives from union and management. Alcoholism Services will provide the initiative to get the program moving, with the support of \"The Substance Abase Planning and Coordinating Committee recommended in the Commission's Special Report on Education and Training':, Occupational social work is an emerging field in Bermuda. The two larger EAP programs on the island are managed by a masters level counselor and a social worker. initially, EAPs appeared to take on a disease model of handling problems. At first,the EAP addressed alcohol and substance abuse issues and later developed to address other problems holisfiically. There are no schools of social work on the island. Bermudians who go abroad to do social work training rarely are offered opportunities for training in EAP settings. While there is interest in this area of practice, the development of employment opportunities is very minimal.The EAP market for social workers can expand; however, workers will have to take the initiative to develop service initiatives. STATUS OF EAPS The first EAP established in Bermuda came as a result of the Commission's report. The National Drug Commission (NDC), formerly The National Alcohol and Drug Agency (NADA), had responsibility for creation of the program.A conference was held with employers, union leaders, and treatment professionals. A strategic plan was introduced to implement EAPs on the island. Many of the employers on the island who participated in the plan were from small businesses that could not see the benefit of an internal program or justify staffing this type of program. Therefore, a consortium model was 41 developed together with the private sector.The EAP was set up as anon-profit, self-governing body. In 1987, the EAP of Bermuda was the first EAP established on the island. Currently it has 200 member companies and serves 1,700 employees. Since that time, the Bermuda Hospitals Board has established an internal EAP program.The Hospitals Board is one of the largest employers on the island and is responsible for the medical and psychiatric hospital on the island.There is another external EAP provider on the island as well. Some of the current issues that EAPs are facing on the island are the continuing problems of alcohol and drugs. Most, if not all, of the programs have initiated Drug Free Workplace programs as well as drug testing. Organizational development is an emerging area of expertise that EAPs will have to consider including in services that they are offering to companies. Bermuda, globally,.is seen as one of the leading centers for international business as well as for insurance and reinsurance business. Team building, coaching, relocation services, and strategic initiatives are important to these companies and EAPs will have to begin to look at ways to meet the needs of these unique companies.

The climate of South America is-similar to that found in North America, only in reverse. Traveling from the wet equatorial north, where annual rainfall exceeds one hundred inches, the region becomes increasingly drier. Snow is common (May through August) in southern Argentina and Chile.The archipelago of Tierra deI Fuego at the tip of southern Argentina is the last piece of land before Antarctica, and this desolate area closely resembles Alaska, The 2004 population of all of South America is just over 350 million. Comprised of twelve countries and two territories (Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil, Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana, and the Falklands) the continent was first inhabited by the Incas, the Aztecs, and numerous indigenous native peoples. I.I~~li7:,'1 On his voyage to the new world, Christopher Columbus discovered South America (for Spain) in the late 15th Century. Spain then claimed and colonized the region during the 16th Century. By treaty, Spain gave Brazil to the Portuguese (who actually discovered the country in 1500). Suriname, while discovered by Spain in 1498, was actually colonized by the Dutch (during the1600's).The French claimed Guiana in 1604 (now French Guiana), and this region remains under French territorial jurisdiction.The British hold claim to the territory of the Falklands, but the Islands were probably discovered by either the Spanish or Portuguese in the 1500's, with British colonists the first to inhabit them in 1690.There remains a major ownership dispute,as Argentina continues to claim the Falklands were given to them by treaty with Spain. The year 1500 began a new chapter in world history: the beginnings of capitalism. It was capitalism \u2014the private owner- ship of wealth, and, the pursuit of profit\u2014that drove exploration from Europe. The free market of capitalism encouraged individuals to invest their money to earn profits, and the result was the expansion of enterprises to new and far-reaching regions of the world. 43 The merchant traders of Europe, first from Spain and Portugal, then England, were aided by their explorers (and their armies) to invest in the New World. In quick fashion, Spain laid claim to almost all of South America.The Spanish moved to destroy any, resistance to their claims, and in short order put an end to the indigenous peoples of the region. Spain built an enormous empire on the continent and efficiently transported South American goods back to their home country. However, what Spain (and, later, Portugal) failed to do was to build an infrastructure and to implement laws -and policies promoting and protecting economic and social development, By the 17th Century, the Spanish were experiencing difficulty in managing their colonies, They levied high taxes on indigenous laborers and built huge Spanish -owned farms (haciendas). Little was shared.The workers, mostly natives, were treated as slaves. (Slavery was actually introduced in Brazil from Africa, and did not end until the close of the 19th Century.) For the Spanish the most valuable goods were gold and silver, and until the early 1800's Spanish precious metals from South America (and Mexico) accounted for almost eighty percent of the world's supply. Spain also imported sugar and coffee along with many other food products and rare wood. In colonizing the people, the Spanish introduced them to Catholicism, and the Catholic presence in South America remains strong today. From 1800 until 1826, virtually all of the countries of Sauth America rebelled against European colonial rulers. By 1830, all had established independence. The rebellion against Spain was inspired by the French and Mexican revolutions and put before the world on canvas by Francisco Goya. Led by Simon Bolivar (Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Peru) and Jose de San Martin (Argentina) the continent was taken from Spain by sword and musket. Quickly, though, the new \"free\" States began to differ on their opinions of rule, and by 1830 most countries were in political turmoil. Of importance, the revolutionaries were mostly of Creole descent (mixed heritage), while the peasants were overwhelm- ingly Indian, Mestizo, or African. In essence, hacienda ownership transferred to the new \"Creole\" owners, while the poor stayed in their villages.And, because ancestry was of such great importance,the natives,the Mestizos, and those of African heritage remained in the same feudal system. After independence, a new form of foreign domination, \"neo colonialism\" surfaced. The new colonial power was Great Britain, and Britain's economic dominance in South America was fueled not only by its need for goods but also by its key role in the industrial revolution. Review, of foreign investment in South America reveals that the British have been by far the most significant investors. The turmoil between the new countries established after the break from Spain gave power to both national and private military forces.The strongmen the\"caudillos, \"came into power quickly using military might to control politics. 44 South America has a long history of military control and it was not until the late 20th Century that formal .elections prevailed,The United States, like Great Britain, has for many years used South American natural resources to its advantage. Looking the other way at social inequality, the U.S. has chosen to respond, often by military force, only when the wrong leader gained power. Military intervention, financial support, sanctions, and political pressure by the U.S. have been strongest whenever /wherever \"leftist\"governments have surfaced, Quite dissimilar to the revolution in the U,S., which united the states (after the break from England) and brought about both economic -and social change, the revolution in South America was essentially \"political\" in nature. As such, the movement hardly touched the existing economic and social structures. Political independence created disunity because it resulted in twelve individual countries. Again, no real economic orsocial..change took place: Manual labor remained the job of the lower classes, while the land own~n upper classes thrived. To protect their wealth, the upper classes simply limited competition. While the United States was removing any/all barriers to free trade, the rulers of Latin America were implementing strong customs and exchange barriers to protect themselves. Thus deprived of larger markets, business in South America remained \"small\" by North American standards, with farming and ranching continuing as major areas of employment. South America's response to the Great Depression involved the nationalization of utilities, the petrochemical industry, mining and banking. Private, for-profit enterprise was kept at a \"second- tier\" level. This greatly limited economic growth. The economic deficits that inefficient state-run companies realized pushed South American governments to print more \"money, thus fueling the inflation that has led to the economic troubles of today. SOUTH AMERICA TODAY Despite lingering economic problems, the past decade has been one of change for South America. Free elections and democracy have replaced authoritarian rule, and while one or two \"hot spots\" remain, the old social elite have learned to heed public opinion, In addition, South American politicians now realize that their future rests on foreign investment and many are currently involved in selling the concept of\"free trade\"to constituents. Isolationism is no longer relevant as the continent's economy moves towards globalization. As global suppliers of energy, precious metals, and food, South America's businesses are positioned to profit from the continuing rise in global prices. Currently, global capital is moving to the world's most attractive markets, and investment in South America is slowing as companies try to decide whether the region is in a recession or recovery.Today, South America must increasingly compete with Asla, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Near East for American, Asian and European investment. 45 Throughout South America the old \"elite\" are now challenged (with some caught in scandal) and voters in Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Argentina, and Venezuela have elected new parties and new leaders to office. Chile, Brazil, and Uruguay have seen economic growth the past two years, due mostly to domestic consumption. Argentina has realized a rise in GDP (gross domestic product) due to increased exports. This year (2004) is expected to be a good year for the region, and foreign investors are responding favorably. Today, most of the world's largest corporations are in business on the continent. All of the world's automobile makers have operations in South America, as do most other large global manufacturers. In fact, it is difficult to find a global corporation that does not have some presence here. .Foreign presence -is helping the economy a great deal.lt is also bringing about a shift in social structure.Over the past two decades multinational companies have found an effective formula for doing business globally.ln order to be competitive in local markets they now realize that they must establish a strong\"local\"identity and presence.And many of the products they produce in South America are for regional markets, not export. Today, many multinationals are positioning \"national managers\" in key jobs, using their expatriates (who in the past ran operations) to locate, train, and mentor nationals. This is a significant shift in paradigm, and its effects are being felt throughout the world, not just in South America. STATUS OF EAPS Only a very few Employee Assistance companies are in operation in South America today.While a number of U.S.,Canadian, and European -based EA providers have service networks in South America, only eight (8) current providers are \"local\" in-country companies. In-country EAP companies are located only in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Venezuela. The historical overview will hopefully provide readers with a better undersfianding of the culture and business climate of South America.The following review of services will focus only on those countries where EAP is offered by local providers. ARGENTINA Approximately one-third the size of the United States, Argentina is the second largest country in South America (eighth largest in the world), The 2004 population is just under 38 million with approximately 1 S million people living in the metropolitan area of the capitol, Buenos Aires. Buenos Aires is the most European of all large cities on the continent. 46 Since its independence from Spain (1816), Argentina has experienced political turmoil. First, it was the struggle between the landed aristocracy (the Federalists) and those in Buenos Aires (the Unitarists), By the end of the 19th Century, the cosmopolitan elite in Buenos Aires had won power. Strengthening their social and business ties to Europe, the Unitarist victory brought millions of European immigrants to Argentina. As such, the country has always had strong ties to European interests and investment, and has always been particularly vulnerable to both European and global economic downturns. While the 20th century began weli,the Great Depression hit Argentina hard. Economic failure and distrust of European and other foreign interests resulted in a military coup in 1943, and until Juan Peron won election in 1946 (and again in 1952) Argentina was under military rule. Due to high unemployment and inflation, internal conflict began again during the 1970's and 1980.'s. With the military in control, the government eradicated all criticism by force, and found itself facing _ worldwide opposition for its actions, (This period was referred to as the\"Dirty War Years.\") -- Government opposition continued until the -late 1980's, and it was probably the Falkland's War with Britain (over owner- ship) that united the country. Returning to civil rule, the new government worked hard #o curb inflation and to put people back to work.Yet, despite numerous attempts, the economy remained unchanged and civil unrest continued. In December 2001, Argentina defaulted on its loan payments to the United States. A number of different governments attempted to establish order, but by January 2002, Eduardo Duhalde had become the country's fifth president in two weeks. Duhalde's first move was very unpopular, but necessary, as he was able to devalue the Argentine Peso and was successful in seeking help from the IMF (International Monetary Fund). While business in Argentina has not yet normalized, its government has.The current government, under President Nestor Kirchner, is managing to accomplish tremendous economic change.The road to economic solvency in Argentina will be a long one, but the country (and its current government) is now recognized worldwide for its achievements and Argentina's future is beginning to look more favorable. The first EAP company in Argentina was EAP Argentina of Buenos Aires. Beginning its services in the late 1990's; EAP Argentina sprung from a large psychology group practice, the Centro Privado de Psicoterapias (CCP). Under the direction of Dr. Hugo Hirsch, an Argentine psychologist very involved in global healthcare initiatives, EAP Argentina relied heavily on help for its start-up from the EAPA (Employee Assistance Professionals Association). EAP Argentina remains a division of the larger company and is now under the direction of Eduardo Lambardi, a psychologist. ICAS Group, Milton Keynes, England, a global EAP provider, and its partner organization, ICAS Argentina, of Buenos Aires, began their operations in Argentina during 2000.The second program to offer EAP services in the country, ICAS Argentina 47 is under the direction of Mario Canale, a psychologist. The company continues to maintain its offices in Buenos Aires, but like EAP Argentina ICAS Argentina is a countrywide provider. BRAZIL Approximately the size of the continental United States and the largest of all South American countries, Brazil's population exceeds 170 million people. And, as the most vibrant economy and business leader of the region, Brazil leads the way with regard to the development of Employee Assistance Programs. Today, more than 3,500 U.S. and European companies have offices in Sao Paulo, Brazil, a city with more than 15 million inhabitants. Sao Paulo has always been the business center of Brazil, but it is fast becoming an important continental h~;isincss hu\"~ ~; ~vell.ln Brazil, occupational social services began during the 1930's and preceded the ims~!nmeht~tion, cif Em to ee Assistance Pro rams b almost fift ears. As such, EAP histor here is dee I mixed with that of oc p y g y y y y p y cupationai social services. Yet the EAP concept in Brazil maintains a strong and similar identity to the more traditional. EAPs found in North America. In response to the Great Depression, which hit South America and all of Latin America very hard, the Catholic Church (through the Order of St. Augustine) began training Brazilian women as \"social assistants\" in the early 1930's. The first Brazilian school of SocEa!!~!ork ::gas later opened in Rio de Janeiro in 1937. However, it ~n~as Brazilian President Get~.tlio Vargas (1937-1945), whose political party was strongly socialist, who paved the way for the Occupational Social Worker. From the time of their introduction to business /industry,the \"Assistentes Socials\"have continued to build their programs as model social service efforts. Since the early 1940's social workers have been performing the role of internal providers of employee support. Most of the services that they provide though, are really Work-Life in nature.These include: personal budgeting /budget management; family planning and family issues (including child rearing); meal and dietary planning; the selection of community resources and some counseling. One of the weaknesses of occupational social services in Brazil has been the lack of training of social workers in the areas of mental health counseling and substance abuse treatment,This is not a problem when a social service effort is correctly recognized and positioned as a Work-Life program, but does severely detract from its staff's ability to deal with more serious \"clinical\" problems. And, while a number of Brazilian \"Assistentes Socials\"have sought additional training in these areas, many internal occupational social workers now seek to contract with an external EAP provider simply to address this problem. Of great significance, it has been the Brazilian occupational social workers who have been the most supportive of the EAP concept. 48 In the area of mental health and substance abuse treatment, there has also been a void with regard to service coverage under the National (government funded) and most company (privately funded) Health Plans.This has forced a number of Brazilian companies and (other country) multinationals to contract directly with private treatment providers, or specialists, including EAP. A new Brazilian law, Law #9656, now requires that all health plans provide minimum in/outpatient coverage for mental and substance abuse treatment. Passed in 2000, butjust now coming into effect, this law greatly alters the benefits provided to those covered under Brazil Health Plans, and should have a strong and positive effect on the future of EAP in the country. In short, EAP in Brazil is well positioned to grow considerably under this new paradigm. Within this context, the opportunity for marketing EAP services in Brazil is gaining momentum. Viewed as formal 'structu.red \".arograms designed to deal with problems not addressed by traditional social services, the EAP model fillsa- recognized void.An external \"outsourced \"model, providing a wide range of services and attractive pricing, now realizes the competitive edge.lt is this type of\"external \"service that is beginning to be seen throughout the country. The first (official) EAP in Brazil, an internal effort, was the program started by U.S, multinational Johnson &Johnson at its Sao Jose dos Campos location in Sao Paulo in 1982. Because Johnson &Johnson had provided social services to its employees for many years, the EAP did not displace the Occupational Social Service group, but was implemented as a service within this Department. The first EAP Administrator, trained as an EAP counselor by the J & J corporate staff, was Maria Isabel E.Volu,a social worker. Only two Brazil-based EAP companies \u2014Mind Performance of Rio de Janeiro (1997), and Solutions, Latin America of Sao Paulo (1998)\u2014currently operate in the country, although several U.S. and other country EAP providers have networks in Brazil. Servicing more than sixty client companies between them, most being U.S European, or Latin American multinationals these two. providers offer\"real\"Employee Assistance programs (with some cultural nuances). Both Mind Performance and Solutions, Latin America are nationwide providers, and both have business relationships with providers in the United States, Europe (including the United Kingdom), Australia, and Canada. In addition to nationwide coverage, Solutions, Latin America provides EAP and expatriate support services in most of the countries of South America, in Central America, in Mexico, and in the Caribbean. Both Mind Performance and Solutions are actively involved with the Employee Assistance Professionals Association, EAPA, Arlington,Virgina -USA. Brazil is the \"trend setter\" of South America. Like the State of California in the United States, it is said of Brazil, \"what is current (and successful) in Brazil generally becomes the trend throughout the region.\" And the EAP movement in Brazil is gathering momentum. 49 There were, and still remain, a number of challenges for these two pioneering organizations to overcome. The most significant challenge in Brazil is still the general lack of knowledge about EAP among potential purchasers.This problem is exacerbated by the scarcity of reliable \"local\"data. Program utilization and client satisfaction reports appear to beat least \"equal to\"the results seen in more mature markets.(Fiowever,program utilization in Brazil is generally much higher than is utilization in North America.) There is not, as yet, concrete local evidence of any real impact that EAP has had on either productivity or return on investment (ROI). Additionally, in Brazil there is some hesitation in the professional community regarding the efficacy of brief, solution- focused counseling. In a country (actually a continent) where the mental health culture is primarily psychoanalytic in perspective, frequent arguments about outcomes and efficacy, as well as the value of other approaches, are common. Nevertheless the pntentialsocioeconomic benefit of providing EAP is becoming more clear.ln Brazil (and in5outh America - - in general) the low purchasing power of the population, including workers, remains a problem.The great bulk of the pop- ulation continues to have difficulty in accessing specialized professional services. Business /industry continue to demand high levels of performance from their workers, and the daily pressures of trying to make ends meet while maintaining a personal and family life increase the negative stress felt by workers and their families.These problems are becoming more visible and have been recognized not only by company Medical representatives, but also by the media and the government. In short, these are the \"hot\"topics in Brazil today, and they continue to reinforce the value of the EAP. Another contributing growth factor to EAP in Brazil has been the expansion of private health care plans (beginning in the 1960's). As private plans have expanded to include more and .more workers, and as medical charges have continued to climb, there has arisen a need to find less costly approaches to treatment.This factor comes very much into play as health plans in Brazil must now offer in/outpatient mental and substance abuse treatment as part of the benefits offerings (Law #9656). Cost-cutting will surely include an EAP alternative, as insurers (and self-insured companies) begin to realize their exposure under the new law. In addition, social workers, psychologists, physicians, and other professionals are beginning to see the rather attractive business opportunity that providing an EAP could offer to them. Finally, in Brazil there is a growing interest in EAP as a \"value added\" service.This \"value added\" positioning is the result of EAP being seen as a U.S. business product, thus in itself carrying more weight simply because EAPs have had such great success in North America. in general, providers, brokers and buyers of corporate benefits are increasingly adding products and services to their portfolios, and EAP is now being added to the menu of service offerings. CHILE The longest and narrowest country in the world, Chile is approximately twice the size of the State of California. Its coastline (to the west) is more than 6,400 km in length. Chile's 2004 population is estimated at slightly under 16 million. 50 The Republic of Chile has a very stable government and is viewed as a leader in South America with respect to democracy. Chile also has a strong market-oriented economy and is very much involved in foreign trade,The mining industry (copper and other minerals) leads the way in Chile, with fishing, paper production, fruit, chemicals and wine the country's chief products. For more than a decade, Chile has been a role model for other governments in South America, In essence, Chile has been able to successfully implement strong economic reform. Despite a severe drought that negatively affected the economy during 1999, Chile has maintained strong financial institutions and a sound fiscal policy.On January 1, 2004, the country signed a free trade agreement with the United States. It should come as no surprise that EAP in Chile was first accepted by the country's largest employer group, mining,The program offered by Servicio Medico CCHC, Santiago (a medical group practice) began its.EAP during the mid-199~'s,The Servicio Medico EAP continues today under name. Serving Servicio Medico's consultant, Celina Pagnani- Touisignant (formerly of Levi-Straus and Company, San Francisco) helped them to implement their EAP. Born in Uruguay, Celina moved to the U.S. at an early age; and was involved in both EAP and WorkLife services for many years before beginning her consulting work in South America.The program she helped to implement in Santiago continues today as one of only two current Chilean providers. The other EAP now operating in Chile became a registered company during 2004. Named \"Employee Assistance Services de Chile; and based in Santiago, this group is actually a component of a larger organization, EAP Latina.The EAP Latina group includes both EAP Argentina (formerly mentioned) and this new company,EAP de Chile. VENEZUELA Venezuela has been the most important oil provider in the western hemisphere. The country also has the world's largest heavy crude reserves. The petroleum industry was nationalized in 1976, but in 1996 the business was again opened to private enterprise, particularly for joint ventures. This has meant that Venezuela remains home for multinational oil companies like Conoco -Phillips, Chevron -Texaco, BP, and others, Venezuela is also one of the oldest democracies of the region and has not been involved in war for more than 100 years. During the twentieth century, Venezuela moved from being a rural to an urban country. It has also developed a strong middle class that is well educated. Poverty, now a significant problem, was at a low point during the late 1970's (when only 25 percent of the population fell below the poverty line). 51 However, these are turbulent times for Venezuela. Because of the country's dependence on oil and its long history as a welfare state, poverty and civil unrest have increased progressively.The poverty level now is at a high point (70%), and the official unemployment rate, while listed by the government at 15 percent, is probably closer to SO percent of the population, (People, for example, who sell items on the street are now counted as \"employed' Hugo Chavez, a military officer who failed at an attempt to oust democratically elected Carlos Andres Perez in 1992, was elected President in 1998. Chavez, since his election, has dismantled many of the country's old institutions or gained control over them. The Venezuelan people have responded in mass to this situation, and have just this year (2004) managed to move the government's Consejo National Electoral to hold a national referendum. Despite the polarization that has occurred, and some episodes of violence,thesituation has remained civil and somewhat peaceful.This,cespectfor \"political process\"must - be credited to the Venezuelan people, who have acquired a strong democratic culture through the years. Venezuela has extraordinary natural resources, a hard working and peaceful people, and a large educated middle class. Venezuelans are known for their warm and welcoming behavior toward foreigners and foreign investment.This is a beautiful country, well situated in South America, and one, hopefully, with a long and peaceful history yet to come. EAP is a relatively new concept in Venezuela and was first introduced to the country by U.S. multinationals (primarily oil companies) wanting to provide support services, including counseling, to their expatriate families. There are only two \"local\" in-country providers of EAP in Venezuela at this time: Servicio Integral al Empleado y Familiares (SIEF), and Humana (not affiliated with the U.S. company of the same name). The first program to begin operations in Venezuela was SIEF of Caracas. Helped considerably by efforts from Dixie Wilson (then with the Conoco EAP in Houston, Texas) SIEF's founder, Dr. Lila Scott, began her operations as Conoco's expatriate support contractor. (Conoco is now ConocoPhillips and Dixie Wilson remains with the ConocoPhillips EAP,) Dixie Wilson, along with other Conoco EAP staff, trained Dr. Scott in EAP services delivery. By 1999, Conoco was essentially running a full-service EAP in both Caracas and Puerto la Cruz, through contract with Dr, Scott. Dr. Lila Scott (now deceased) was a Canadian psychiafirist who practiced in Caracas for many years. One of the leaders of EAP in South America, Dr. Scott's program (SIEF) was the first EAP in the northern region of the continent. She is remembered by many EAP professionals in the United States for the services that she provided to their companies. SIEF continues to provide programming to a number of oil companies and has networks throughout the.country.The program is now under the direction of Lila-Vega Scott, Lila's daughter (also a physician). 52 Also located in Caracas is the program run by Dr, Pedro Delgado, a Venezuelan psychiatrist, Called Humana (not affiliated with the U.S.-based company of this name),the enterprise began as a substance dependency program and became an EAP service in approximately 2000. The Humana Program continues to offer substance dependency treatment services and general counseling while also offering EAP. Like SIEF,the primary customers of the Humana EAP are U.S. and other multinational corporations. As in other South American countries, a number of U.S., Canadian, and European EAPs have providers or networks in Venezuela. Some of these companies contract for services with either SIEF or Humana and others have their own providers. There are only two in-country EAP providers in Venezuela today. The EAP market in Venezuela continues to be the larger multinationals, and no local companies have implemented these services to date. IN SUMMARY EAP is a relatively new concept on this continent and, except for Brazil, most of the purchasers are U.S., Canadian, or European multinationals or (external) EAP providers. This makes sense, developmentally, because this is the same group responsible for bringing EAP to South America. The first programs were .internal efforts, beginning in Brazil during the mid-1980's, with external providers surfacing here during the mid-to-late 1990's. And, while there was a chapter of the Employee Assistance Professionals Association (EAPA) in Sao Paulo for several years, that group has folded and there are no other Chapters of EAPA or any other such association in operation today. There remains, though, great hope for the expansion of these types of programs in South America. One of the major problems with the failure of the EAPA here was (and continues to be) the language difference. This was even more a problem in Brazil, where the only Chapter was formed, because of the language\u2014 Portuguese. While many EAP materials have been translated from English to Spanish, none were available in the language of Brazil. When EAP has been implemented, the results have been striking. Utilization of EA programs here, with nationals (local employees), is quite high. Some EAPs see utilization rates exceeding 20%. In addition, with the multinationals now expanding services to their expatriate workers throughout the continent, nationals are beginning to realize the benefit and success of EAP, and programming has been moving swiftly from the expatriate to national employee groups. And, finally, the HR profession here in South America is beginning to realize the importance of EAP and EAP-like programs to not only HR, but also to Safety and Health efforts.The HR professional associations have had a significant impact of growth and expansion of programs, particularly in Brazil and Argentina, and will certainly continue to help with program growth. 53 RESOURCES Ken Burgess, M.Ed., LPC, CEAP Managing Director Solutions, Latin America AI. dos Jurupis,1005, CJ: 72 Moema - SP Sao Paulo, Brazil Ricardo Esche, M.D. Technical Director Avenida das Americas, 700 Bloco 5/Gr.140 21-3139-9190 Liliana Scheliga, M.A., Psychologist Clinical Director Solutions, Latin America Sao Paulo, Brazil liliana@solutionsla.com.br (55) 11-5042-0668 Fax: (55) 11-5531-6015John Burns, Marseille, 100-Vila da Repres CEP 04826-440 johnburn @amcham.com.br (55) 11-5928-9094 Eduardo Lambardi Director - EAP EAP de Argentina Av, Del Libertador 6049 1st Floor \"A\" (1428) Venezuela (58) 41-6608-9224 lilavega @cantv.net 54 EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN CANADA BY ROD PHILLIPS BACKGROUND Canada has to nurture an environment that ... cashes in on creativity, promotes international connections that facilitate global marketing and builds the new knowledge industries of tomorrow. The Conference Board of Canada Will We Rise to the Challenge? Eight Mega Issues Facing Canada February 2004 The challenges described by The Conference Board are largely those that will be borne by Canada's employers\u2014 securing Canada's place in an international marketplace; competing with the rest of the world for top talent; stimulating research and marketable product development; and ensuring an accountable, affordable and high quality healthcare system.' As these issues shape the social, political and economic context in which Canada's public and private sector organizations operate, Employee Assistance Program providers must evolve our services to support employers in meeting these challenges. By doing so, we fulfill our mandate to offer human services through workplaces that bolster the resilience and the competitiveness of Canadian employees and their employers. Since the 2nd Edition of the International EAP Anthology (2000), the EAP landscape in Canada has changed significantly. Like the organizations we serve, Canadian EAP providers have faced intensified domestic and North American competition, an industry characterized by mergers and acquisitions, and increased access to Internet -based technologies that have expanded the types of services and methods. of service delivery. Canada's EAP providers have responded to these pressures and others- by diversifying their services, the way in which they are offered, how we measure their effectiveness, and how they function in relation to an increasingly cash-strapped publicly- funded healthcare system. In 2004, Canadian EAPs can be deemed to have \"come of age.\" We are poised to enter the global marketplace as Canada has cautiously but quietly confident and prepared to compete internationally with creative products and unique strengths that have emerged during a period of industry change,commoditizationand consolidation.lnthe chapter that follows,we are placing EAP within this broad context: identifying and analyzing the characteristics of Canada's social, economic, political and business trends that set the stage for the employer and employee experience, and therefore provide the backdrop against which EAPs are designed, delivered and function. CANADA: ITS SOCIAL, POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND GEOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS Canada is a relatively new country, now comprising ten provinces and three territories, whose coming together in 1867 was SS less a confederation of like minds than it was a defense against the possibility of assimilation by the more united United States to the south. Our newness as a country is likely the psychological root of our ongoing openness to newcomers: by 2001, recent immigrants represented almost 70 per cent of tabor force growth in Canada with 20 per cent of the total labor force (3.2 million workers) born outside the country,' making for remarkably diverse workplaces. Over the past twenty years, Canada's immigration patterns have fluctuated in waves mirrored in the day's headlines: immigrants from Southeast Asia and China the dominant groups in the late 70s; those from the Caribbean and Central America in the early 80s; Eastern Europe and the countries of the former U.S.S.R.as well as the Indian sub-continent and Arab states in the late 80s/early 90s; and those from Somalia and other parts of Africa among the dominant groups arriving in the mid to late 90s. Today, Toronto, Ontario is noted as the most ethnically diverse city in the world, with 80 different nationalities making up its population of 4.7 million' Vancouver and Montreal display similar cultural mosaics. Although our cities are experiencing the effects of years of underfunding, the influx of immigrants primarily to Canada's urban centers is notably smooth: Canadians remain justifiably proud of the fact that our cultural diversity exists hand-in-hand with one of the lowest overall crime rates in the developed world even in our major cities, and an overall quality of life ranked consistently in the top 10 by the United Nations 4 As the population ages, we will increasingly rely on immigration to revitalize the abor force and contribute the skills and expertise required to maintain our standard of living and position in the global economy. The largest country in land mass in the world, we are three times the size of our neighbor to the south, but our population of 32 million, is one-tenth that of the. United States. Of this number, more than 24 million\u2014or 75 per cent\u2014live in or near one of Canada's major cities5 and approximately 90 per cent of Canadians live within a 90-minute drive of the U.S. border. More than 75 per cent of Canada's industry is located on what is known as the Windsor -Quebec Corridor \u2014a 900-kilometer stretch tracing the. Lake Erie-Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River trade route originally established by the fur traders of the Hudson's Bay Company, Canada's longest- running, indigenous private enterprise, still ringing up sales at the tender age of 334. \"The Bay\" notwithstanding, Canada's is an export-based economy. The majority of our exports \u2014primarily automotive, oil and gas, agricultural products, and natural resources including timber, pulp and paper, and minerals \u2014are shipped to the U.S., our largest single trading partner. The pros and cons of our dependence on U.S. markets and the tenor of the U.S: Canada relationship are matters of endless public dialogue \u2014at least, in Canada \u2014and both institutional and individual introspection. Regardless of the emotional valence of the debate, it is a fact that, as The Conference Board points out, \"managing the bilateral relationship given the competing priorities of security and trade\" is one of the eight\"mega issues\" facing Canada. Canada remains proudly independent politically and socially, as evidenced by our views on issues such as gun control the legalization of marijuana, gay marriage, and the war in Iraq (which is not to over-simplify or gloss over the'signi~ cant regional differences of opinion within Canada on these issues). Mowever,we work and trade in an interlinked, interdependent North American marketplace.Canadian EAP providers who underestimate the impact and implications of this fact will miss 56 opportunities and misunderstand the realities of the working conditions and competitive environment of most of their clientele, HEALTHCARE ENVIRONMENT Aside from our relationship with the U.S., the next most important self-defining characteristic of Canada is our publicly funded, universal healthcare system. \"Medicare\" is enshrined in the Canada Health Act, and viewed as an unquestioned entitlement, if not a sacred right, of most Canadians. Provincially administered and funded by federal transfer payments proportionate to each province's use, the national healthcare system offers all Canadians a basic standard of care, including unfettered access to physicians and other specialists within a public hospital system and private practices. Private health insurance and employer- sponsored extended health benefits from one of Canada's many group insurers offer additional coverage for prescription drugs, semi-private and private hospital rooms and para-professional or elective services such as physiotherapy, national healthcare system, such that Canada's employers shoulder less of a burden for basic healthcare than their peers in the U,S. and, in theory if not always practice, all Canadians have access to a minimum level of care regardless of income. The public hea~thc~re system is under siege, however; especially since the cutbacks that occurred during the economic downturn of the 90s, and the corresponding electoral success of more fiscally and socially conservative governments provincially and federally.ln their struggle to maintain patient care and services, hospitals merged and \"regionalized \"\u2014a trend that has only recently abated, pui the enects or` which continue to be refit throughout Canadian society. i-iospitals have been sorely challenged to attract and retain staff.This is compounded by the declining enrollment and graduation of physicians, nurses and other medical professionals from Canadian medical and nursing schools, and the \"brain drain,\" particularly of radiologists and nurses, who are lured south with better salaries and working conditions. Up to one-third of Canadians do not have a primary care or family physician, and must travel long distances; rely on a patchwork system of walk-in clinics and Hospital emergency departments; or go without care altogether.b To Canadian healthcare consumers, this means more sporadic access to declining levels of care, longer waits even for critical services, and, ultimately, poorer health, To Canadian employers this means a greater reliance by employees on extended health benefits, as well as rising incidence and costs of absenteeism and short- and long-term disability as employees struggle to access the right care at the right time'to resolve their medical issues. STATUS OF EAPS in describing the landscape of EAP in Canada, we must focus on the landscape of Canada itself. Our large and sparsely- populated country means that many employers must contend with vast distances separating groups of employees, located primarily in major cities, but also often in quite remote communities as well. Before technology eased communications and management difficulties by bridging the distance gap, Canada's employers evolved to function fairly autonomously within 57 their distinct regions. Even national employers are primarily structured with regional divisions, some of which are managed and offer banefits that are quite distinct and may be completely different from each other, Unlike in the U.S., individual states or small groups of states are densely populated enough to support large regional EAP providers, Canada's EAP providers are either large and national, or small and local. Canada's national EAP providers mimic the structure of the markets they service, having a central office and regional satellite offices (three of the five\u2014Ceridian, FGI and WarrenShepell\u2014 are headquartered in the Toronto area; the fourth\u2014 WilsonBanwell \u2014in Vancouver; and the fifth, Family Services Association, is a network of social service agencies across Canada). Single region and local EAPs offer their communities another option. Because of their smaller size and. fewer resources, they often focus on mainstream counselling, and may not have the infrastructure to support extended EAP services such as child/eider care, legal, financial or online services. There is little solid data to gauge EAP uptake by Canadian employers. According to a recent survey, 57% of Canadian mid- to large-size employers (those with more than 500 employees) had some form of EAP as part of their health and wellness benefit.' Beyond employer size (as measured by number of employees),thereare few other indicators of the likelihood of EAP implementation. WarrenShepell covers major and minor employers in every economic sector and region of Canada, and our experience is similar to other national providers. That said, several trends are worthy of note. Public sector employers are most likely to have well-entrenched EAPs as they were mandated to implement EAP in the mid-80s,just as the field was developing in Canada.lncidentally,these organizations see some of the highest utilization rates. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs; in Canada, defined as those with less than 500 employees), which currently employ 63 per cent of working Canadians and which, as a group, are creating more than 78 per cent of all new jobs in Canada e are somewhat less likely to have EAPs. Some would argue they also are most likely to need them given that they may not have in-house Human Resources departments. An organization's reasons for implementing EAP are multi-fold, and may include one or more of the following: Acknowledgement ofrisk-sensitive workplaces, and the need to address these preventatively to reduce liability. The impact of addictions in the workplace continues to be the impetus for many safety-sensitive employers to implement an EAP.This is especially true in unionized environments. As Canada prohibits mandatory drug or alcohol testing except in certain limited circumstances, there is not the same incentive to implement EAP as-there is in countries with mandatory substance use testing and treatment. The desire to be positioned as an \"employer ofchoice\" \u2014this can include those truly leading-edge and first-to-market in terms of their philosophy and approach to employee health benefits and related initiatives, and those who seek the competitive advantage of being known as a market leader and include employee wellness initiatives as a mark of such distinction. It can also include those in an industry that is highly competitive for knowledge workers, and therefore whose support for their`intellectual'capital is judged as a recruitment and competitive advantage. 58 Infernal public relations purposes. Given the general market saturation of some form of EAP, these are the \"keeping up with the Joneses \"employers, who consider EAP a necessary, but not necessarily important, part of their overall benefits package.Their rationale for having an EAP is reflected in a typically low-key approach to promoting and communicating the program,which results in low rates of program penetration and utilization. ironlcally,these are typically the organizations most intent on hearing a \"return on investment\" rationale for EAP, but those least likely to achieve it as a result of low program use. A traumatic workplace event such as a robbery, accident or death in the workplace, or a specific instance of problematic employee behavior, Many organizations'dip their toes in the water' with ad hoc services to help them cope with these types of urgent situations, before being convinced of the value of a full-scale EAP. This is likely the root of the high penetration of EAPs in financial institutions. However, we note that in Canada financial services: organizations and insurance companies are among the most progressive when it comes to employee health and wellness. CLINICAL ENVIRONMENT Models: short-term, assess-and-refer; integrated EAP and worWlife EAP models in Canada are straightforward, but growing more differentiated as the market continues to attempt to avoid the commoditization of service. All national providers offer EAPs comprised of mainstream counselling and a broad range of wor;;/life services. l7 Canada, thCJC are defined as including child acid elder tare, and I~gai and financial consu(taiion services \u2014at minimum. Most worWlife programs also include additional services such as nutrition, homecare access, or concierge services.Trauma services are routinely available, as are wellness seminars and other supplemental services that address specific employee and organizational health issues, There is some differentiation to be seen among national providers in these latter two service lines. There is a trend towards \"capped\" models, but the approach is not as rigid as that seen in the U.S., where three, five and eight-session capped models are the norm. In Canada, the most common model does not place an administrative capon the number of sessions available to individual users, but rather manages average sessions within the core utilization rate. Where a cap is offered or requested, the most common ceiling is six sessions. Especially since the introduction of programs that focus on delivering Internet -based information and worWlife services and de-emphasize mainstream counselling, there has been a movement toward offering what is known as an\"assess-and- refer\" EAP model, An assess-and-refer EAP will typically offer one to three sessions of in-person counselling, with the goal to refer the individual to community resources for a continuation of counselling or other service.The onus in this model is awayfrom problem resolution within the EAP,and toward the use of community resources.lmpiicit wfthinthe model is the shift in responsibility for costs away from the employer, and on to the employee. It is viewed as a particularly \"American\" 59 model, especially given the Canadian sense of entitlement to low or no-cost healthcare service.Although not popular with most employers there has been some uptake for this model among employers in category three with respect to their reasons for implementing an EAP, as described above. STATUS OF OCCUPATIONAL SOCIAL WORK The academic discipline of Occupational Social Work does not exist in Canada. EAP clinicians', academic backgrounds most often are; Master's of Social Work (MSW), specializing in individual, family or group counselling. Most MSW EAP clinicians have practiced or interned in hospitals, community /social service agencies or addictions treatment facilities and may have independent practices. Under the umbrella of the Canadian Association of Social Work, provincial professional bodies (Colleges or Associations of Soc+al Wnrk) ~?ff~r z:c'dst~~%,nal accreditation such as the Registered Sociai Worker (RSW) designation after a stipulated period of practice and supervision which varies by province. Master's of Psychology (M.A., M.Sc.) or Master's of Educational Psychology (M.A., M,Ed.), specializing in counselling. The Canadian Psychological Association (a branch of the American Psychological Association, APA) and the provincial psychology associations under its umbrella certify and register individuals with Master's level credentials out of these academic streams as\"psychologists \"(Quebec) or\"psychological associates \"(other provinces, including Ontario) after they have attained a certain numb?r of post-Master's clinical hours under the supervision of a Ph.D.-level psychologist, Individuals with or without this additional certification practice as,therapists and counselors, often in the same venues as those listed for MSWs and in their own private practices. A Doctorate in Clinical Psychology (Ph.D.(C.Pysch.)), is the required degree of ali clinical psychologists in Canada, as it is in the U.S..These individuals are fully qualified to diagnose and treat individuals using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), published by the APA.They do not dispense medication \u2014an element of practice reserved for medical doctors, including psychiatrists. Most Canadian EAP providers' networks include a mix of Ph.D., MSW, MA and M.Ed. degrees. As there is no EAP-specific licensure or course of study in Canada, and as therapists and counselors may come from a variety of settings, it is imperative that Canadian providers take great care to hire and credential the most qualified practitioners. In Canada, perhaps even more than in the U.S. where state licensure is a requirement for practice, EAP providers must be able to demonstrate that the individuals delivering counselling service are academically and experientially qualified to do so. Additional in-service training to enhance individuals' workplace- and EAP-specific skills is of the utmost importance. The steps most major EAP providers have taken and continue to take to .achieve accreditation for their CS~7 programs (i.e., through the Council on Accreditation), offer the assurance and proof that these providers' clinical networks and other operations are consistent with the minimum standards of professional EAP practice. . MAJOR PLAYERS NATIONAL /INTERNATIONAL There has been some consolidation among national providers in Canada. It is estimated that the two largest providers, WarrenShepell and FGI, account for 60% to 65% of the total Canadian EAP market. Ceridian, 675 Cochrane Drive, North Tower, Markham, ON REGIONAL Regional providers continue to operate successfully and offer an option to client organizations that operate within conned geographies.The following providers are those most well known within their regions: West (BC, AB, SK, MB) Interlock Employee and Family Assistance Corporation of Canada, 4727 Hastings Street, Burnaby, BC VSC 2K8 HumanaCare Organizational - 2V9 OHI (formerly Kelly Luttmer &Associates), 910 S.W., Suite 700, Calgary, AB T2P 3N8 Manitoba Blue Cross Employee Assistance Centre, 230 -1610 Ness Avenue, Winnipeg, MB R3J 3X3 Ontario EAPIus, Avenue, Ottawa, K1 Y 4R4 Link Employee Assisfiance Professionals P.O. Box 43, Barrie ON L4N 657 Homewood Behavioural 1 N8 PUBLIC/SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCY Family Services Health Canada (offers EAP to federal departments) m A notable trend is group insurer / EAP partnerships. The longest standing of these is the relationship between WarrenShepeli and Great-West life Assurance (GWL), which has existed since 1989. Recently (2003), Manulife selected Wilson Banwell to deliver EAP and related programs through a Manulife- branded health benefit.These types of alliances are expected to become more common as EAPs seek alternate delivery channels for their product, and as group insurers realize the advantages of incorporating a mental health benefit into their product portfolios. CURRENTISSUESINEAPS Addictions: EAPs' roots in addiction counselling aside, it remains true today that addictions represent one of the less frequently addressed issues in Canadian EAPs. Addiction or substance abuse as a presenting issue typically runs at two to three per cent of total cases seen in EAP; that's far below a national addiction rate estimated at ten per cent 9 This discrepancy -<.~ ;~ . is LF;fs,und \u2014in Canada \u2014to the fact that mandatory drug and alcohol testing is prohibited except in limited circumstances. As a result, EAPs need to tread a fine line--standardized drug and alcohol assessment is vital to uncover the need for addictions treatment early, both to see that employees receive the appropriate type of help and to see that the organization's risk is mitigated. Major mental health disorders: Depression is now a leading cause of psychosocial -based short-term disability claims and anti-depressant /anti-anxiety drugs are almost always among the top five of those covered by employer- sponsored drug plans.'\u00b0According to the Global Business and Economic Roundtable on Addictions and Mental Health in the Workplace, mental health problems cost Canadian organizations in excess of $11 billion/year in lost productivity, absenteeism, short-term disability, and related direct and indirect costs. As with addictions, EAP faces a predicament in adequately uncovering and treating depression, anxiety and other major mental health disorders in the workplace as a result of its self-referral nature and secondly, because EAP is\u2014by definition \u2014a short-term counselling approach.The most efficacious treatment for depression continues to be a combined pharmacological /counselling approach \u2014with longer-term, cognitive -behavioural therapy being the preferred modality.\" EAPs can do much in the way of assessing and referring individuals for appropriate treatment, but the assess-and-refer model used here is fundamentally different from that practiced within athree- session capped EAP. Assessment and referral must include adequate, appropriate use of clinical tools for identifying clinical depression; infrastructure support for these \"red-flag\"cases with additional resources, including psychiatric consults and facilitated referrals to pre-screened treatment facilities; and a well-trained network of practitioners who can support the individual both by providing direct therapy for mild to moderate cases of depression, and/or to assist the individual in choosing an appropriate resource and then work in a case management role to ensure that he or she receives adequate support during recovery. Relapse prevention programs are critical in this area as in addictions. 62 Violence in the workplace: Although workplace homicide remains rare, aggression and acts of workplace violence continue to represent a significant source of concern to employers, A number of provinces have enacted specific legislation requiring employers to take action to prevent workplace violence,andanti- harassment laws are well entrenched in the Canada labor Code and provincial labor laws. In June 2004, the Province of Quebec enacted some of the most strongly- warded legislation yet, allowing employees the right to sue their employer for \"psychological harassment. \"The definition and determination of what constitutes psychological harassment, and the employer's obligations to prevent or respond to such acts, will emerge as the legislation is tested in the courts. At the least, the legislation is raising the profile of the issue and drawing ~ attention to the need for professional consultation and resources to be available to organizations and individuals. SUMMARY _... _ As.workplaces gro~~,~ +~~ ~~sir,~~y ~~~\u00bb~~ex, as health and wellness becomes more entrenched as a strategic value to organizations, and as psychosocial illness and disability become increasingly identified as organizational cost drivers, EAP will continue to be necessary and to evolve in Canada. For most employers the business case has been made for EAP\u2014as they, and their providers, grow more sophisticated the case to be made now is to demonstrate the impact and direct value that a healthier workplace offers those organizations willing to invest in creating it. EAP providers who can contribute to the newly-emerging field of health and productivity management, who can share iheii~ knowledge and data with public policy makers, researcf~ institutions, group insurers and benefits consuiiants, and, of course, Canada's employers, will be at the leading edge of EAP practice. In so doing, they will be embarking on the'active maturity' phase of EAP\u2014taking 25 years of history forward into a new era in employee and organizational health and wellness, and assuming their rightful place as contributors to the health and wellbeing of working Canadians and their families. 63 RESOURCES AND PROVIDERS WarrenShepell Rod Phillips 130 Bloor Street West Suite 200 Toronto, Alberta and Canadian Policy Research Network Judith MacBride -King Conference Board of Canada Linda Duxbu~; ` , _`.

The Chinese healthcare system is equally marked by a combination of old and new. What is called \"western medicine\" increasingly represents the bulk of hospital care, complemented (sometimes vociferously) by the smaller proportion of proponents of ancient Chinese medicine, still taught in some schools, and reliant largely on acupuncture, relaxation and herbal n~ t,;:;,': ,.VU~~stnrr~~. ,;-~ ~,ai+:ii~e comes with sophisticated electronic equipment, and it is sometimes said that western r'`:\u00b0' \u00b0\" medicine is better at diagnostics and traditional medicine than at cure. The view may be difficult to hold in professional circles but would probably represent a gut level belief among the population at large. China is a vast country with only a small percentage of land suitable for agriculture of any scale, though many individuals will be finding subsistence from the earth. Much of China is mountainous and remote. 70% of Chinese have no access to medical services. Hospital facilities exist in the main cities of its nineteen provinces b.ut these vary in terms of the depth of resources. At the top end a large hospital in a very big city may have three kinds of wards: one open to the tiny number who are wealthy enough to pay privately, one kind open to the larger group who now have insurance, and the rest state-run wards. In mental health care, psychiatry is the dominant recognized profession. However, its image is similar to its image some decades past in western countries, with services seen as dealing largely with \"insanity': As has happened also in the west, psychology will become (and in some places already is encroaching on) psychiatry's dominant position \u2014and again, in a familiar pattern, will eventually be overtaken by counselling, It has been estimated that 10,000 practicing psychologists already prefer to practice as counselors though only a small proportion (approximately 600) have sought a qualification in counselling recognized by the ministry of labor. The stigma attached to individuals seeking help with mental health problems is bringing some practitioners to rebrand themselves as\"motivational consultants \"and the like. This trend will undoubtedly grow as employer- subsidized support services for employees develop alongside the rapid expansion of manufacturing and other sites. STATUS OF EAPS EAPs have quite surprisingly already gained recognition among HR specialists. However, EAP's typically do not have direct access to substantial budgets. An EAP conference in Shanghai in October 2003 attracted 70 or so HR participants, and 65 another larger conference is planned in Shanghai for May 2005 under the auspices of the Asia Pacific Employee Assistance Roundtable. As in other parts of the world, it is probable that EAPs will expand in China, principally on the back of American and other multinationals: What form they will take eventually remains to be seen. Insofar as the Chinese government is already aware of EAPs,they will want the formula to have a distinctive Chinese character. The specific needs of the Chinese industrial culture, as it continues to develop rapidly over the next few years, will call as much for training in management skills and perhaps in conflict resolution,as it will for remedial or supportive therapy.On the other hand, the one child per family regulation brings with it a number of parenting issues that run deep throughout society,with acute problems for the child as well as other members of the family.The regulation was put into force because over-rapid population growth would have exhausted a slender base of economic resources and would have created health, poverty and starvation problems of a far greater magnitude.The regulation will almost certainly be softened over the coming years as China's industrial and commercial base grows, but therapists will find it still an endemic problem in many of their clients. The visibility of the EAP option has brought considerable interest among psychologists and others, some of them recent graduates, and induced them to set up as EAP providers. Those listed below are quite small compared with providers elsewhere, but offer telephone access and a small network of counselors, and are run by experienced professionals. Much of the early impetus for EAP work has come from Hong Kong rather than the mainland, but the more general preference for Mandarin Chinese or pure Cantonese will almost certainly see the balance tilted the other way before long.

The Scandinavian countries consist of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.The Nordic countries consist of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Greenland, Faroe Islands and Aland. Regardless of the form of government, the heads of state in the Nordic countries have relatively little power. All the countries have a democratic constitution dating from the 19th century and, with the exception of the Norwegian Constitution, they have all been revised several times. :; ~~~:.: Like many other countries, the Nordic countries have had a lot of wars and occupations; the Danes and Swedes have suffered the most.ln peacetime there has been a lot of interaction among the nations, so the cultures are well known to each other.The languages are similar,and that has helped with peaceful coexistence,trade,the exchange of craftsmanship, and the sharing of art and ideas. During World WarTwo, Denmark was occupied, Norway was at war with Germany, and Sweden declared its neutrality.After the war, the situation was sensitive because of Finland's bonds with the Soviet Union.5weden was a neutral buffer zone and Norway and Denmarkjoined NATO.The Nordic countries have been a very active part in numerous neutral UN peace- keepingforces. The countries have never had violent revolutions, but there has been a strong self-assured labor force that has created a social-democratic society.lt may not be the bestfrom the perspective of business but the Nordic model\u2014with a very high social security for ail citizens \u2014has proved to be a good platform for a society. Education, unemployment benefits, a health care system, and care for children and the elderly (inclusive pensions) are provided either free or for a modest payment. Some of the Nordic Welfare State has rinsed away with the last decade's waves of liberalism, but not as intensely as in other western countries.About nnethird of the GNP is devoted to social security. 67 RELEVANT STATISTICS Denmark Faroelslands.

Percent of total population aged 16-64.2002 In recent decades, the Nordic countries have experienced some turbulence in their financial situations. Finland had to change production and sales markets after the collapse of the Soviet Union.They have succeeded and are now strong in the paper industry and hiah tech products. Norway was traditionally a rather poor country with some exports of fish and some shipping business. Now they have found oil in the sea outside southern Norway. The surplus of this industry is partly used to develop production in other areas. Sweden was traditionally the richest of the Nordic countries, with significant production of steel and automobiles. They were a little slow to transform to the new market economics and had a rather severe recession. However,they now have a healthy growth rate. Denmark has traditionally featured a big meat production and dairy sector. After the discovery of oii in the ocean between England and Denmark, the surplus from this industry has raised the GNP.The shipping business is going very well.in the pharmaceutical industry and the production of windmills, Denmark is in front of the market. The Nordic countries have high responsibility levels for global issues.They try to follow the Kyoto recommendations, and when it comes to development aid to less developed countries they give 10 times more of their GNP per capita than the US does. 68 RELEVANT ISSUES IN DENMARK SOCIAL SECURITYAND INSURANCE Denmark has a very high level of general social security. This means that' the worker will get compensation from the public if he is injured.Treatment is also free.Therefore, there is not a need for big compensations.All employers must have insurance for their employees. In 2003, the rules were changed and the new rules feature extensive improvements in the system of industrial injury insurance, Now, work-related injuries are to be recognized as industrial injuries regardless whether or not they are \"foreseeable\" or \"common. \"This eliminates a number of loopholes that existed in the former system.On January 1, 2005, it became a little easier for the employees, because of the enforcement of a new system called \"The labor Market's Occupational Disease Insurance.\" In general, the compensations in Denmark are small. An unjustly fired person .gets a maximum six months' salary in compensation. Work-related injuries are very seldom compensated with more than \u20ac150.000. UNEMPLOYMENT Most Danes have unemployment insurance.They will receive about 80% of a minimum income. If they do not have this insurance then they are able to get payment from the general social security funds. PENSIONS Ail Danes have a right to a basic pension.The ability to work' is considered, and the more disabled you -are the more are you compensated. Many people have special unemployment insurance so they can get an \"after salary\" once they reach their early sixties. Many Danes live off these\"after salaries\"from their 62nd year until they can get their elderly pension (at age 6S for women and at age 67 for men). Most white-collar workers save about 13% of their work income on a special pension fund.This means they can live a good life free of financial worries after they retire. People working for the public get a special pension. It is calculated from their income and years in service. They are compensated so well that most civil servants do not have additional savings. SICKNESS BENEFIT An employee who is unable to go to work for physical or psychological reasons will normally just continue to receive the 69 same amount of money as if he were working. It is possible to get this benefit for up to twelve months. For some of this period, the employer will get refunded some of the payment \u2014about \u20ac1000 per month\u2014from the public. After a year the income will drop rather dramatically for most persons. STATUS OF SAPS (Denmark) Since the 1960s, some of the big companies in Denmark have had some in-house counselling services for employees. The type of service provided has been varied. One company had a lawyer, some companies had nurses, a few had psychologists, and some had part-time social workers. Some of the unions also offered some counselling \u2014mostly performed by social workers. In 1899, the first agreement between employers and employees regulated rules for the labor market. This agreement included a little sentence that really was out of place in this paper; it specified that both partners in the agreement should look iriio thi drinking problem in the workplace:ln spite of this,and in spite of the large amount of driniciny ~n the vanish workplace, nothing happened.ln the 1980s the big labor organizations began to deal with the problem.The pioneer in this field was the city of Copenhagen.They svpported the development of an EAP model and the introduction of EAPs in some of the city's own workplaces. After some years the model was adopted by the Ministry of Health and spread out in the, country. Around 1995, the model changed from dealing with alcohol problems to offering a more general intervention in all kind of problems that could lower performance.Around 2000,the first workplace heath care system was started. There are no exact figures, but about 25% of the Danish workforce now has some kind of EA. The concept of EA is well known in Denmark now, but it is a problem that we have not developed the fundamental concepts of linguistic description. There are still some taxation problems when EAP/Work Life and health care services are provided. This means that elements of the service provided by both external and internal providers sometimes must be handled in different fiscally different fiscal ways to comply with the law. EXTERNAL PROVIDERS Psyko/oggruppen af1984 In 1984, a group of psychologists established a network.Their primary task involved critical incidents debriefings after rob- beries in banks, but they also provided service in connection to redundancy. 70 NMC In 1989 DMC (Danish Mental Heaith Centre) was founded.When they established offices in Sweden the name was changed to NMC (Nordic Mental Health Corporation). NMC provides full-scale EA/WorkLife services 24/7 in all the Nordic countries. NMC provides services to more than 5% of Danish employees. The NMC department NER (Nordic Business Counselling) delivers trainings, organizational consultancy, coaching, stress management, support to HR departments and many more services.The NMC department Work4Health delivers all kind of health care. They work also with prevention, and do many trainings and a lot of heath counselling. NMC is able to provide services worldwide and can assist with relocation problems both in Denmark and the rest of the world. Falck Falck Healthcare specializes in services in connection to critical incidents, but can also deliver services in connection t workplace and family issues.They also offer physiotherapeutic treatment in connection with their health care plans. The Triangle is a group of psychologists who provide service in the Copenhagen area. STATUS OF EAPS (Norway) There is no tradition of EA in Norway. But the big international oil industry in the southern parts of Norway and the establishment of international computer software companies have led to some changes, because these companies expect the same services for employees in Norway as they get anywhere else, The Nordic company NMC is providing its EA broad-brush services all over Norway with 24/7 services. NMC serves both small local companies and the Norwegian departments of big international companies. NMC is an EAPA and EAEF member. Stavanger Radgivningsbyr~ (SR) is a seven year old local EAP company. SR is an EASNA and EAEF member. The Center for Crisis Psychology is located in Oslo and Bergen. This company has been involved in international disaster work for more than a decade.They also provide services after robberies, serious illness and other critical incidents. 71 RESOURCES AND PROVIDERS DENMARK NMC Nordic Mental Corporation www.nmc.nu +45 70.101 102 International NORWAY Akan (The tripartite Committee for prevenfiion of Alcohol and Drug Problems in the Workplace) Brussels Office: +32 Unions www.lo.dk +45 3524 6000 to@lo.dk NMC Free phone 800 18 145 Sales and marketing +45 70 101 102 www.krisepsykologi.no 72 EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE BY BEN LOCASTO BACKGROUND HEALTH CARE IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE Central and Eastern Europe have universal access health care systems. However, these systems are characterized by continued underfunding, resulting in poor infrastructures and lack of staff incentives. A legacy of the Communist focus on inpatient care is the vast oversupply of hospital beds. This takes up a disproportionate share of already limited heath care budgets and inhibits funding for more cost effective approaches such as ambulatory and preventative medicine. This underfunding and inappropriate allocation has led to the development of a secondary health care market within the public system, in which individual patients are often forced to pay from their own pockets to access a theoretically free service. There is a reasonable level of clinical competence and training in most CEE countries, and in some countries there are world-class practitioners in certain specialties. This underscores the fact that the main problem confronting health care reform is not medical competence but the need for re-process engineering, and reallocation of funds. These systemic CEE health care problems have led to the following trends: Changing methods of financing from central budgetary control to insurance -based reimbursement systems. The gradual introduction of free market principles between providers of care and insurance fund payers. An increasing acceptance that the public system will remain underfunded and therefore needs to be complimented by private funding and insurance. Employers increasingly more involved in, and concerned for, the health of their employees. An increased awareness and demand by the public for an accessible; humane, and affordable system, A gradual increase in life expectancy, which will substantially increase demand for health services. Several companies have emerged to fill the gaps in CEE health care. Preeminent among them is Medicover. Medicover offers employers the opportunity to purchase extended health care coverage for their employees for a fixed subscription fee. Medical care is provided in a timely, professional manner, in state of the art freestanding clinics as well as on-site clin- ics in the workplace. Essentially an HMO model, employers can purchase varying levels of health care to help attract and retain the best employees and to maintain optimal employee effectiveness. Medicover takes a holistic approach to health care by fostering prevention, intervention and feedback to client companies, in order to identify and correct workplace conditions that may be negatively affecting employee physical and mental health. 73 ESTONIA INTRODUCTION Estonia is a country of approximately 1,4 million, in an area slightly smaller than New Hampshire and Vermont combined. It borders on the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Finland, between Latvia and Russia, Estonia has been populated by native Finno Ugric Estonians since prehistory. It was first formed when the German Sword Brethren and Denmark conquered the land in 1227. Subsequent foreign powers that controlled Estonia at various times included Denmark, Sweden, Poland, and Russia. Following the collapse of Imperial Russia, Estonia declared its independence as a republic on February 20, 1918. Forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in June 1940, it regained its freedom on August 20,1991, with the \"Singing Revolution\" and the collapse of the Soviet Union. August,20th is celebrated as Estonian Inder~;_ ?c'er-;cc 1)ay. Since the last Soviet troops left on August 31, 1994, Estonia has been free to promote economic and political ties with Western Europe and other countries. it,became a member of NATO on March 29, 2004, and a member of the European Union on May 1,2004. POLITICS Estonia is a constitutional democracy, with a president elected by its unicameral Parliament. Elections are held every five years.The Executive branch is comprised of 14 ministers who are appointed by the president after approval of the parliament. Legislative power lies with the Parliament, which consists of 101 seats. Members are elected by popular vote to serve four- year terms.The national Court is Estonia's Supreme Court, with 17 justices. The Supreme Court's chairman is nominated by the president and is appointed for life by the Parliament.. ECONOMICS As a member of the European Union, Estonia is part of the world's largest economic zone. in 1999, Estonia experienced its worst year economically since it regained Independence in 1991, largely because of the impact of the August 1998 Russian financial crisis. Estonia joined the World Trade Organizafiion in November 1999\u2014only the second Baltic sfiate to do so. Privatization of energy, telecommunications, railways, and other state-owned companies is a continuing process. Estonia completed most of its preparations for EU membership by the end of 2002, and now has one of the strongest economies of EU member states.The Estonian economy is growing fast, partly due to a number of Finnish companies relocating there and its strong IT sector. Estonia's GDP is the highest of the Baltic states. 74 HUNGARY INTRODUCTION Hungary is a landlocked country bordering Austria, Croatia, Romania, Serbia, Montenegro, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Ukraine.. It is slightly smaller than Indiana, with a population of approximately 10.1 million. Tradition holds that Hungary was founded by Arpad, who led the Magyars into the Pannonian plains in the 9th century. The Kingdom of Hungary was established in 1000 by King St. Stephen I.The early history of Hungary is intertwined with that of Poland and Bohemia, including many liaisons with Popes and Emperors of the Holy Roman Empire. Modern Hungary emerged from the polyglot Austro-Hungarian Empire which collapsed during World War I.In March 1919, the communists joined the government and proclaimed the Hungarian Soviet Republic. This government proved to be short-lived; the Romanian army invaded, August In January 1920, elections were held for a unicameral assembly. Admiral Miklos Horthy was elected Regent. In June, the Treaty of Trianon was signed, fixing Hungary's borders. Compared with the prewar kingdom; the size and population of this new Hungary were reduced by about two-thirds. Miklos Horthy ruled with dictatorial powers for most of the interwar period. Horthy made an alliance with Nazi Germany in the 1930's in the hope of recapturing the territorial losses that followed L\"Jorld Vb'ar {. Hungai y was rewarded by Germany with the territories belonging to Czecnosiovakia,Yugosiavia avd Romania, and took an active part in World War II. However, in October 1944, Hitler replaced Horthy with the Hungarian Nazi collaborator Ferenc Szalasi in order to avert Hungary's defection to the Allied side. Following the fall of Nazi Germany, Hungary once again became a communist state. In 1956, Hungary's revolt and announced withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact were met with military intervention by the Soviet Union, and led to the deposition and execution of the reform-mind- ed communist prime minister; Imre Nagy. In the late 1980's, Hungary led the movement to dissolve the Warsaw Pact, and. shifted toward a multiparty democracy and amarket- oriented economy. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Hungary developed closer ties with Western Europe. Hungaryjoined NATO in 1999 and joined the European Union on May 1, 2004. POLITICS Hungary is a Republic. Its president is elected by the parliament every five years, and has a .largely ceremonial role, but powers do include appointing the prime minister.The prime minister selects cabinet ministers, and has the exclusive right to dismiss them. Each cabinet nominee appears before one or more parliamentary committees in consultative open hearings, and must be formally approved by the president. 75 The unicameral, 386-seat National Assembly is the highest state authority, and approves legislation sponsored by the prime minister. A party must win at least 5% of the national vote to form a parliamentary faction. National parliamentary elections are held every four years. A 15-member constitutional court has the power to challenge legislation on the grounds of constitutionality. ECONOMICS Hungary continues to demonstrate strong economic growth as one of the newest members of the European Union (joined May 1, 2004).The private sector accounts for over 80% of GDP. Foreign ownership of and investment in Hungarian firms is widespread with cumulative foreign direct investments totaling more than US $23 billion since 1989. Hungarian sovereign debt was upgraded in 2000 to the second-highest rating among all Central European transition economies. Inflation and unemployment \u2014both priorities since 2001 -have declined substantially. However, economic reform measures such as health care reform tax reform,and.local_gov~Cnment.financing have not.,,,~~t k?er ;~~!d~r,;~~;~' ~;y'b\"~e current government. POLAND INTRODUCTION Poland is located east of Germany, bordering on the Baltic Sea, Belarus, Czech Republic,Germany, lithuania,Russia, Slovakia and Ukraine. It is slightly smaller than Mexico in area, and has a population of approximately 38.6 million. Poland is an ancient nation that was conceived around the middle of the 10th century. During the following century, the strengthening of the gentry and internal disorders weakened the nation. In a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795, Russia, Prussia and Austria partitioned Poland among themselves. Poland regained its independence in 1918, only to be overrun by Germany and the Soviet Union in World War II. it became a Soviet Satellite state following the war, but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive. Labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union \"Solidarity.\" Over time, Solidarity became a political force, and in May 1990 swept the parliamentary. elections and the presidency. A \"shock therapy\" program during the early 1990's enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in Central Europe, but Poland currently suffers from low GDP growth and high unemployment. Solidarity suffered a major defeat in the 2001 parliamentary elections, when it failed to elect a single deputy to the lower house of Parliament. The new leaders of the Solidarity Trade Union subsequently pledged to reduce the Union's political role. POLITICS Poland is a democratic republic. Its current constitution dates from 1997,The government structure centers on the Council of Ministers, led by the prime minister. The president appoints the ministers who are nominated by the prime minister, typically from the majority coalition in the Lower House of the legislature. The president serves as head of state, and is elected every five years.The citizens of Poland elect a parliament,The National Assembly, consisting of 460 members of the 76 Lower House and 100 members of the Senate. Lower House and Senate members are chosen by proportional vote, on a provincial basis, and serve four-year terms. With the exception of ethnic minority parties, only political parties receiving. at least 5~/0 of the total vote can enter the Parliament.The judicial branch plays a minor role in decision -making. Its major institutions include the Supreme Court (thejudges are appointed by the president on the recommendation of the National Council of the Judiciary, for an indefinite period), and the Constitutional Tribunal Judges chosen by the lower House for nine-year terms,The Lower House, on approval of the Senate, appoints an \"Ombudsman;' or Commissioner for Civil Rights Protection, for a five-year term.The Ombudsman has the duty of overseeing the observance and implementation of all civil liberty and human rights legislation. ECONOMY Poland has pursued a policy of economic liberalization throughout the 1990's, and today stands out as a success story among transition economies. Even so; much remains to be done. The privatization of small and medium state-owned companies, and the liberal law around establishing new firms, has encouraged the development of the private business sector. However, legal and bureaucratic obstacles, alongside persistent corruption, are hampering further development. Poland's agriculture remains handicapped by structural problems, surplus labor, inefficient small farms, and lack of invest- ment. The government's recently- initiated restructuring and privatization of \"sensitive sectors\" (e.g, coal, steel, railroads and energy), has stalled, Reforms in health care, education, the pension system, and state administration have resulted in larger than expected deficits. The government's determination to enter the European Union on May 1, 2004, has shaped most of its policy and new legislation. ROMANIA INTRODUCTION Romania is a country of approximately 22.4 million, with an area slightly smaller than Oregon. It borders the Black Sea, Bulgaria, Hungary, Moldova, Serbia, Montenegro and Ukraine. Modern Romania came into being when the principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia (for centuries under the rule of the Turkish Ottoman Empire) secured their autonomy in 1856 and united under the name of Romania.The country gained full independence in 1878.It joined the Allied powers in World War band gained new territories following that conflict.ln 1940, it Joined the Axis powers and participated in the German invasion of the USSR. Three years later, overrun by the Soviets, Romania signed an armistice. The post-war Soviet occupation led to the formation of the \"people's republic\" in 1947, and the abdication of the king. The decades -long rule of Nicolae Ceausescu began in 1965. Ceausescu, through his Securitate police, became increasingly more oppressive and draconian through the 1980's. In 1989, he was overthrown and executed. Former communists dominated the government until 1996, when they were swept from power by a fractious coalition of centrist parties. Currently, the Social Democratic party forms a minority government, which governs with the support of the opposition Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania. Romania joined NATO in March of 2004,and is a candidate for accession into the European Union. 7~ POLITICS Romania is a democratic republic. The legislative branch of the government consists of two chambers: the Senate, which has 140 members, and the Chamber of deputies, which has 345 members.The president is elected by popular vote every five years, and is the head of the executive branch.The president appoints a prime minister, who heads the government, the members of which are appointed bythe prime minister,The government is subjectto a parliamentaryvote ofapproval. The judiciary branch is composed of the Supreme Court of Justices, Supreme Court judges are appointed by the president, upon recommendation of the Supreme Council of Magistrates. ECONOMY After the collapse of the Soviet bloc in 1989-91, Romania was left with an obsolete industrial base-and an industrial capacity wholly unsuited to its needs. In February 1997, Romania embarked on a comprehensive macroeconomic stabilization and: structural reform grogram, but re`~rr~+ has been a frustrating stop-and-go process. The government's priorities include: obtaining renewed IMF lending, tightening fiscal policy, accelerating privatization, and restructuring unprofitable firms, Unemployment in Romania is at 6.2% (2004), which is low compared to other European countries. Romania was invited by the European Union in December 1999 to begin accession negotiations. It is expected to join the EU in 2007, along with Bulgaria. Despite improvements, Romania still faces several key problems: rampant corruption on almost all levels of society, lack of transparency regarding public spending, lack of economic competitiveness, and the slow pace of reform in the public (state owned) sector of the economy. 5rarus of EAPs In most CEE countries, the term EAP refers to\"Environmental Action Plan.\"The concept of Employee Assistance Programs is a foreign one: Mental health is delivered in a medical model by psychiatrists. For the most part,the notion of\"counselors\" does not exist, and social workers fill the traditional role of working with the indigent.That having been said, however, CEE countries seem to be ready for EAPs. And they are in many ways even more amenable to these programs than much of Western Europe. Companies like Medicover are discovering what many in the West; particularly North America, have known for some time: twenty to thirty percent of patients who present for medical treatments cannot be medically diagnosed.That is,there is no physical disease, injury or condition to explain their discomfort. Neither is psychiatry appropriate in the majority of these cases. More and more they are coming to understand that something else is required to address these patients. Most CEE countries \u2014especially Poland, with its roots in the labor movement \u2014are very sensitive to workplace conditions that affect employees. Many CEE counfiries have. stringent regulations around working conditions and the hours one is permitted to work. These two forces are combining to propel CEE countries toward adopting EAPs, Furthermore, companies like Medicover are uniquely positioned \u2014because of their integrated data collection capabilities, their holistic health care approach, and their superior technology \u2014to take EAPs to an entirely new level of effectiveness. Medicover plans to rollout EAP services in Central and Eastern Europe i.n 2005. 78 RESOURCES Fredrik Ragmark .Managing Director Medicover C/o Belro Medical S.A Waterloo Office park Building 0 Dreve Richelle 161 B-1410 Waterloo Belgium Phone:+ 32 2 357 Fax: +32 2 357 55 05 Office Richelle 161 B-1410 Waterloo Belgium Phone: + 26 540 Lajos,Fabian Bitwy Warszawskie 02-366 Warsaw Poland Phone:+48 22 592 7000 Fax. 22 590 7099 Marcin.ajewski @med icover.pl ROMANIA Bogdonka Militescu, MD Union international Business center 26-28 Stribei Voda St., 7th Floor.

Created by law in 1946, they have degrees in general medicine and specialize in organizational health.They belong to anon-profit network under the control of the employers the employees and the Ministry of Labor. 1000 of them work directly for companies and the others work at one of the 420'inter- company services: They are in charge of preventing health and safety risks in the workplace by regularly controlling the work environment, performing a mandatory annual assessment of all employees and providing targeted advice to management.Their nbjectivesare to promote a healthy workplace, to help companies become more efficient, and to help decrease national health costs. 22,000 CHSCT (Health, Safety and Working Conditions Committees). Created by law in 1982, these committees are mandatory in companies larger than 50 employees.They consist of employee representatives and are in charge of preventing all risks in the workplace with a right to launch enquiries or to ask for an external expert advice.They work in partnership with the Labor Doctors. 3,600 Social Work Consultants (Surintendants de service social).They have DEASS degrees from the'Ecole sup~rieure de travail. social: According to the Jaw, they are mandatory in companies employing more than 250 persons, either as permanent employees or as a resource shared among different companies. However,their number is very small and they only act in some specific industrial companies. They cover areas including: individual support and prevention for professional issues (restructuring; layoffs) or personal issues (divorce, illness); and collective preventive actions in health, safety.and social issues (alcohol, tobacco, debt).Theyare bound professionally to respect confidentiality. 3,8000 Social Work Assistants (Assistants de service social). They have a DEAS from one of 50 accredited schools ('Ecole norma~e sociale' in Paris, for example). 95%are women (known as'assistantes sociales') due to historical reasons. More than 60% work for the public sector. They are in charge of informing people about their rights (for subsidies, health coverage, and training), advising them, and referring them to the right specialist or administration. Most of these existing resources cover basic issues (safety,ergonomics, vaccines) very well, with an emphasis until now,on physical health hazards in the industry sector for blue-collar workers.They have not dealt with mental health, management issues, or issues specific to the service sector (such as stress) as much, but they are evolving progressively to do so. 81 CURRENT STATUS OF EAPS The concept of EAP is not very well known in France, It has appeared in the press as an aid used in US companies in response to the September 11 disaster. Rather than dedicated EAP businesses, there are a lot of activities in EAP-related fields, which combined would cover the field of EAP: HR consulting and [raining, especially focused on stress and related issues.There are many new internal programs in companies like Renault (an \"Observatory on stress\"to audit the individual stress level each year),the national Post Office (to help sales_ staff cope with aggression from customers) or IBM (a \"Wellness Manager\" has trained 40 trainers).A few small external providers are emerging to provide these services. Coaching has become very popular, especially for managers of large companies such as Avantis,Thales, and Danone. A professional association has referenced 450 coaches.There is an annual 3-day conference on the subject. Coaching gPnc~z *cad r?v,~n~aes of 400 million euro in 2004, with a very high growth. Critical incident stress debriefing is used efficiently to respond to major incidents like the 2001 Total-AZF incident in Toulouse or the 2002 floods,These emergency plans (tike the'Orsec' plan) are organized mainly by public authorities (prefects) with public actors (hospitals) at different levels (from city to state) depending on the importance of the incident. Very few companies have a contract with an external private provider; Eurotunnel is an isolated exception. WorWlife and concierge services have begun to gain some ground, and are used by companies including IBM, Pepsi and CSC; usage often involves the help of an extranet website. Hotlines for employee psychological support are still very marginal. Some have been developed in conjunction with local insurance companies (GMF, Mederic, AXA) or unions (CFE-CGC, SNECA) as a service bundled with others. Some are provided by foreign EAP providers from Switzerland or UK (Procter & Gamble,Yahoo). There are a number of factors that help to explain why EAP is slow to emerge in France: Public health care social security systems, and workplace social bodies are quite efficient. Psychologists are very theoretically diverse but very few have a systemic or workplace focus. Counselors have no recognized sfiatus in France (as opposed to the UK,for example). There is a strong tradition. of a workplace /private life divide. Companies don't outsource as easily as their US counterparts (IT was a start, but HT outsourcing , is still low on the agenda). A number of farts suggest that EAPs could develop more quickly in the years ahead: High focus on stress in media, government and unions. First legal case in 2001 at EDF/GDF after stressed employee committed suicide. 82 Focus on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). A Green Paper on CSR was published by the EU (Employment &Social Affairs Commission) in July 2001; the French government supports the document. According to French law, large employers have to include in their annual reports information about their impact on employees, society and environment (May 01 \"NRE\"law) Growing importance of social ratings. A former respected union leader became the head of a European social rating agency (AreseNigeo). Hewitt and the Wall Street Journal Europe publish a yearly'Barometer' of HR sensitive companies in France and Europe.

This corresponds to a population density of 230 persons per square kilometer.The comparative figure for the European Union is 116. Germany is,after Russia the state with the highest population in Europe'.About 7.3 million. inhabitants possess a foreign citizenship. The structure and the development of the population have been subject to dramatic changes for many years now. Currently,the average birth rate is 1.4.This figure will stay constant until 2050, and the number of prospective mothers will go down. Simultaneously, life expectancy will rise to 81 years for men and to 86 years for women until 2050. The share of younger persons under 20 will fall from a fifth in 2001 to a sixth in 20502.The disproportionately high share ~f women caused by the two World Wars is being balanced, gradually, with the succeeding age groups. The changes within the age structure of the German society have an effect on the make-up of the working population.The middle group of the 35- to 49-year-old will decrease: by 31 %until 2050. In 2050, the younger group of the 20- to 34-year- old will probably stand at 24%fewer persons than today.ln contrast,the group of the 50- to 64-year-old will shrink only by 3%.Thus, the share of older people within the working population wilt increase considerably. ALCOHOL AND DRUGS The consumption of alcohol has decreased slowly, but constantly. Still, the Germans are close to the European record holders in beer consumption: last year,the per capita consumption of beer by Germans was only surpassed by the Czechs with 128 litres and the Irish with 125 litres;. However, an alarming trend is apparent in the rapidly growing consumption of mixed drinks containing beer or spirits. Because these new alcoholic drinks represent a particular threat for children and teenagers, the government currently feels compelled to raise the retail price of the so-called \"alcopops\" by massive taxation. There are two relevant data collection systems in Germany that document data on addicts the\"EBIS\"covers the outpatient field and the \"SEDOS\" covers the inpatient field, In 1997, EBIS collected data on about 125,000 persons. 71,512 of them received treatment in about 455 institutions, For 75,6% of the recorded persons, the main diagnosis was alcoholism.The SEDOS data of the same year for the inpatient field count approximately 14,500 treatments in 104 institutions,48 %ofthem in special hospitals for alcoholics. Here, alcoholism was the main diagnosis for 81.9% of the patients ^. In the outpatient field, there are at present about 4,000 self-help groups in Germany with approximately 25,000 participants. Their concepts follow mainly the example set by the AA groups in the USA. 85 STATUS OF EAPS There is not a German equivalent for EAPS, and. there are no comparable programs in Germany. Because of an extremely conservative drinking culture and the dogma of the free market economy that is firmly anchored in consciousness, lobby- ing, and law, activities similar to EAPs depend on individual initiatives of,for instance, occupational social workers. The existing programs (experts count about 500) are almost exclusively run by large-scale industry or big groups of companies. The programs are representative of occupational measures to combat addictionb, Exceptional examples of individual programs run by large enterprises like Hessischer Rundfunk (a TV and radio station), the airline Lufthansa, and the Kloeckner Werke (constructor of ship motors) come close to the classic EAPs. The concept of EAP as defined by the Employee Assistance European Forum (EAEF) is not applied only to the field of addiction in Germany. Examples are the programs COSORE (optimization of entrepre ~:~u ia0 soy:; ~ r~:~, ~c, ~.t~i~iCy and its integration in the business activity of smaller and medium -sized companies)' and SWITCH (training and further education for the executives of the Siemens company)e. Although the number of external services providing occupational social work or EAPs has increased over the last years9, it currently still is insignificant in international comparison. Today, employees' organizations (unions, trade associations) and health insurances (slogan: \"care for health and avoid illness\") go into the battle against addiction more vigorously than in the past with training and information campaigns. There have beer attempts during recent years to reach Germany's sirongly represented medium -sized companies (they account for around 80% of the gross national product) by means of industry -wide measures and cooperation, because these companies have so far neglected to combat addiction due to lack of resources. The Deutsche Hauptstelle gegen die Suchtgefahren (DHS) can be regarded as one of the decisive initiators of this movement that grew quickly. After several German companies had recognized the significance of the problem of alcoholism in the work force in the early 1980s, the DHS intervened more strongly than before in the anti-addiction -work of the companies, because initially fihe efforts were rather arbitrary. So, since 1978, the association. organizes inter alia an annual conference on alcohol at the workplace.This conference is highly valued among experts. Although the work of the DHS is still oriented around a widespread impact and is rather non-binding, it is coming quite close to the EAP movement. The programs of the health insurances within the context of the so-called \"care for health\"exert a major influence in this d irection, toa in addition, programs like AA constitute ane of the biggest resources within the fight against alcoholism, Alcoholism patients generally come into contact with aself-help group for the first time during their stay in hospital, and further regular participation is urgently advised when the patients are discharged after 6 to 12 weeks. 86 SERVICE PROVIDERS At present there are three relevant groups that initiate and carry out anti-alcoholism programs within companies. The numerically largest group are GPs who provide medical service as company doctors. Although alcoholism is recognized as being a problem, the indications and treatments tend to go merely in the medical direction, The option of cooperation between company doctors and occupational social workers often gets in between the millstones of rival interest groups. This impedes progress and is frustrating primarily for the occupational social workers, who often are subordinated to the doctors. The second group are the BSAs (occupational social consultants, equivalent to OSWs). There are roughly 500 German companies with integrated BSA. The Bundesfachverband Betriebliche Sozialarbeit (the BBS is the lobby for OSWs in Germany) knows about 400 companies10. There is a growing but numerically still small groin? ~f in~~??nde^r, external OSWs who provide their services to many companies.The position of BSA within the corporate structure is arbitrary and may differ from case to case.They are assigned to the staff, but also affiliated to the personnel office and/or the medical service.The supervisory authority mostly is a person with no background in the field.ln general the status of BSA is rather low. Thus, it is difficult for BSAs to exert influence. Companies often \"adorn\" themselves with a BSA office without fully exhausting the professional competence. Frequently, BSAs are expected to perform the tasks oftrouble- shooters. Lobby work is provided by the BBS, which represents approximately a quarter of all German BSA employees (and a small share from neighboring countries),In 2004, the BBS is celebrating its tenth anniversary. in addition there are regional net- works with voluntary membership, and in 2002 an association was established that wants to protect the interests of EAP professionals throughout Europe: the Employee Assistance European Forum (EAEF)\".The association has a small number of German members. The third relevant lobby group is the Deutsche Hauprsrelle gegen die Suchtgefahren (DHS). DHS has been able to record a tremendously growing significance in the past 10 to 15 years. The association sells a wide range of specialist literature, brochures, folders, films and preventive measures including instructions, papers and evaluation assistance for seminars; it orders studies and awards research assignments and publishes and spreads the results; it carries out preventive and informational programs in companies; and it trains voluntary addiction counselors and provides further training measures that are highly regarded in the public.Thus, national TV stations and other media were motivated to pay closer attention to the problem of addiction and especially to that of alcohol abuse, encouraging a more positive public attitude towards these subjects. 87 CONCLUSION There are three main reasons for the poor interest in EAPs and their low degree of presence in Germany. 1.A arm implementation of BSA and/or EAP requires a high degree of personal identification of the occupational social worker with his/her job.This identification is hindered massively by the generally very low reputation of social work in German society and the defensive and derogatory attitude towards BSA in places of training and professional associations. BSA and EAP are suspected of collaborating with the parties responsible for the problems that classic social work tries to solve, 2. BSA has a certain tradition in Germany \",but it still is a voluntary social service of the employers that turns into a negiigiblefactorwithin modern management.Also, the professional socialization of German social workers, from whom occupational social consultants are recruited, is by tradition a rather defensive one.Thus, the understanding of role and profession that is necessary for effective marketing evokes alienation ~v~thir, the r~r.ks. 3.The companies' knowledge of the wide range of services of BSA and/or EAP is marginal, and with a high degree of ignorance BSA is seen as a cost factor rather than an investment. Anti-addiction programs are established almost exclusively by large German enterprises, partly with considerable expenditure, and thus stay solitary. 80% of the German gross national product is raised by medium -sized companies, but these companies can't afford such programs. On amedium- and long-term basis the development and supply of individual or industry -wide programs for medium -sized companies will depend on the inventiveness of external and flexible providers.ln this way, EAPs actually do have a chance to gain a foothold in Germany, as the few already existing examples attempt to prove.

However, in Greece, EAPs are still in their infancy and unknown to local professionals. Components of EAPs have been informally introduced to Greece the last decade by business consultants and professionals who provide training and seminars in businesses, but mostly these introductions have occurred on a management level. Since Greece became a member of the European Union, and with globalization, many multinational corporations now also operate in Greece, Current trends in market changes have increased business competition. Additionally, EAPS are needed in Greece because of increased demands from management for new skills, and because of the crisis and natural disaster situations affecting employees'families avd corporations. The unemployment rate and the anxiety created by all types of jobs interfere with the professional long-term strategies for occupational stability and occupational goals. Current research conducted by Eurostat indicated that an amazing 72% of Greek employees are experiencing .stress at work. Based on these facts, the increasing changes within economic /social/family life, and physical disasters such as earthquakes and extreme weather conditions that characterize the Mediterranean region, we have indicated the need for EAP experts in the field. STATUS o~ EAPs In 2002, Dr. Anastasia Rush returned to Greece from the U,S. With 28 years of experience in Mental Health Services and EAPs, she got involved with EU programs as a project manager, trainer and a professor of psychology at University of Indianapolis (Athens Campus). During her professional experience, she was able to identify the absence of EAP services and the needs of Greek employees and organizations in the area of EAPs. Based on this detection, she decided to establish the Hellenic Chapter with the support of Mr. Richard Hopkins, U.K and the support of EAPA in the U,S. This, however, proved to be initially difficult because EAPs were new to the professional corporate world in Greece.There were no skills, no standards, no specializations and no certification for any professional working on corporate support. An additional difficulty was the academic level of the psychologists and the social workers compared to the U.S. Social Workers have three years of academic studies, whereas psychologists have four years of academic studies. However, for years now social workers and psychologists have been hired by companies to offer support to companies without any specialization; their knowledge and expertise develops from their experience within the culture of the company where they work. Additionally, there are no EAP books in Greek, nor are there any statistics regarding EAPs in Greece. It is necessary to translate any material found in order to fit the needs of the Greek labor culture and, in a wider range,the Greek mentality. 90 The U.S. established and adapted EAPs according to the needs of the corporation and the psychological hazards that employees exhibited such as drug taking.The history of other countries has shown that they, too, have adapted to their corporate and employee needs. It appears that we are facing the same process regarding the development of EAPs in Greece. The establishment of EAPs in Greece had two initial goals: to create a professional association for training and certification of professionals interested in .working in this field, and to develop awareness in the Greek corporate community of the need for and the positive outcome of these programs. These efforts started by creating awareness via presentations, teaching an EAP course in the University of Indianapolis (Athens Campus), participating in conferences and seminars regarding the area of Corporate Health and Safety, offeringtraining to organizationsjointlywith other existing consultants, and using media awareness. It appears, though, that initially the introduction of such an innovative concept in the Greek professional and business arena has created a major threat to other business consultants. At the same time, it also has created opportunities. Professional companies with expertise mostly in ergonomics had introduced corporate Health and Safety programs after 1985 and now are showing an interest in including EAPs in their functioning.The existing laws require companies to be certified regarding Employee Environmental Safety and Health issues. This requires that each company with more that 50 employees provide a medical doctor once a month to examine any possible high-risk health issues related to the employees and give a recommendation to the employer, Additionally, the companies must be certified as offering a working environment free of environmental hazards for the employees. Today, international EAP providers such as Chestnut, ACCOR, and PPC are providing services in Greece, mostly to international companies.They accomplish this via Mental Local Health Professionals who serve their International contracts. The first local EAP Company that advertised and provided EAPs to the Hellenic Organization is Hellas EAP, established in 2003. Enterprises likely to benefit from the EAP in Greece include private companies with high Competition sectors where the employees play a crucial role for commercial success (e.g. shipping companies, banking, hi-tech and capital- intensive industries). EAPA and EAPs are creating optimistic reviews but the voluntary spirit to help these efforts in Greece is extremely low. There is a need for volunteers from the members themselves and from professionals interested in the field.The unemployment rate and the anxiety created by all types of jobs interfere with the professional long-term strategies for occupational stability and occupational goals. 91 One goal of the EAPA in Greece is to increase its membership and the credibility of the members. Another goal involves further promoting EAPs by continuous seminars and training in the wider range of Greece. It is also important for the Hellenic Chapter of EAPA to encourage the establishment of a task force in the government. Since Greek law does not require such programs as EAP, it is our intention to communicate and develop awareness within the Ministry of Labor and Health and the Unions for their support. Our long-term goal is to create a successful institution, knowing that it requires lots of effort and time. Another key goal involves the certification of EAP professionals in Greece. Because there is an issue of language, only English speaking professionals can actually get certified.0ur goal is to overcome this obstacle, too. In conclusion, our professional impression and opinion as EAPA Hellenic Chapter is that we are opening a new road to providing many opportunities to implement EAPs to the corporate world and. prc~f~ss~~nais locally.

Hong Kong has a free trade economy with few tariffs or trade barriers.Employment hrishifted from manufacturing toward services over the last two decades.The largest employers are in wholesale and retail trade; restaurants and Hotels (31.8%); community, social and personal services (26.2%); finance, insurance, and real estate (15.1%); transportation (11%); and construction (9.1%). As early as the 1980s, the Hong Kong economy started undergoing an infrastructural change, In order to deal with the rising costs, most of the manufacturing companies started to relocate their plants to the cities with lower production cost.Aftertwenty years of readjustments, those remaining can be considering true survivors especially when they passed the highest costs test around 1997. Since 1997, every industry's unemployment rate has risen. But on a relative scale, the construction sector has been the hardest hit, followed by manufacturing, wholesale, retail and import/export trades, restaurants and hotels. The other industries coped better. The five year slump in the property market heavily affected construction employment. It is partly cyclical (a result of the bursting property bubble), and partly structural (the dominance of the property sector has faded). The government's decision to withdraw from the property market may negatively affect employment first.Thusduring August to October of 2003, the construction unemployment rate reached a record high of 20%. In the period from May to July 2003, the unemployment rate reached 8.7%. It is currently standing at 7.3%,matching the 2002 average. Hong Kong residents generally complete upper secondary education at the age of 17 and college education at 22.Joining the labor force at the age of 15-19,their educational attainment should be matriculation or Iower.According to the 2001 population census, 83.5a/o of those aged 15 or higher have education attainment no high than matriculation. As Hong Kong's economy marches towards aknowledge -based economy, the hardest hit age group by unemployment is 15-19, registering an unemployment rate of 27.2% at the end of 2003. 93 To tackle the unemployment issue,the government has fiaken various measures: setting up a task force on unemployment; establishing an Employment Training program for the Middle-Age, setting up a Youth Pre-employment Training Program; and creating a Re-training Fund. All measures are targeted to fix the unemployment problem. However, it is well acknowledged by Government officials and experts that there is no quick flx solution for the problem. Hong Kong has no unemployment insurance for those temporarily out of work, and welfare assistance is inadequate. The unemployment situation has driven more jobless people to depend on welfare. It is foreseen that even though Hong Kong's economic growth becomes more upbeat in the first quarter of 2004, mismatching of labor force and unemployment problem would still be the major challenges facing industries and workforce in the near future.They also challenge EAPs to become more dynamic and responsive to the emerging needs of the employees, organizations and the community. Besides the EAP, a look at the health, legal and social system will give a glimpse on the situation of the employees and employers in Hong Kong. HEALTH CARE SYSTEM Hong Kong Government is committed to build a caring and healthy society, and it has always been the Government's fundamental philosophy that no one will be denied adequate medical care due to lack of means. To ensure that this principle will be upheld, preventive health care service and fihose promote health are generally free, and medical services, especially for hospital treatment, are heavily subsided by the government. The Social Welfare Department and Hospital Authority provides medical social services and clinical psychologist services in public hospitals to assist patients and their families to cope with personal problems that result from illness or disability. RELEVANT LEGISLATION EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Hong Kong has an employment ordinance stipulating that employee benefits and entitlements will include statutory holidays, annual leave, rest days, maternity leave, sickness allowance, severance payment, and long service payment to employees. Some employers provide additional fringe benefits such as subsidized meals and food allowances, good attendance bonuses, free or subsidized medical treatment, and transport to and from work. Many employees also have employment contracts under which they receive an annual bonus of 15 days or more. LABOR LEGISLATION In early 1990s ,with provident fund schemes growing popular, the Government decided to establish a regulatory regime for retirement schemes. In August 1995, the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance was enacted, and in Dec. 1, 2001, the Mandatory Provident Fund System was implemented. MPF is an employment -based retirement protection system. Except for exempt persons, employees and the self-employed aged between 18 and 65, and who is employed for 94 a continuous period of not less than 60 days under an employment contract, are required tojoin MPF schemes.Mandatory contributions are calculated on the basis of 5% of an employee's relevant income, with the employer matching the employee's contribution.Mandatorycontributions are subject to the minimum and maximum levels of income,which are $5,000* and $20,000 respectively. Employees earning less than 55,000 a month do not need to contribute but their employers have to contribute 5% of the employees' income. Employers, employees and self-employed persons can opt to make extra, voluntary contributions in addition to the mandatory contributions. Since 1997,substantial improvements to employee's rights,benefits ,safety,and health were madethrough a series of labor Iaws.The Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance was enacted to extended the protection of safety and health at work to employees in the non-industrial sectors.The Employment Ordinance was amended to remove ambiguities in relation to maternity protection, definition of wages, protection of wage payment, and end-of-year payment. They also served to strengthen protection for employees against unreasonable termination of employment on grounds of pregnancy, sick leave, work-related injury, participation in union activities, and giving evidence in legal proceedings regarding labor legislation. The Trade unions Ordinance was amended to let employers, employees, and officers and members of trade unions have immunity from civil proceedings in respect of any act done in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute. EMPLOYEES RETRAINING SCHEME The Hong Kong Government continued to devote much effort to easing unemployment. The Task Force on Employment, set up in June 1998 and led by the Financial Secretary, has implemented over 40 measures, including advancing government projects, strengthening services, enhancing vocational training and employees'training. The employees retraining scheme is a government program set up in 1992 to provide retraining for local employees to cope with structural changes in the economy. Since 1997, the primary focus of the scheme was providing retraining for unemployed individuals 30 years or older,who had no more than a lower secondary education. It also provides retraining for the employed who need to receive basic skills training to sustain employment; and the ambit of the scheme has been extended to include new arrivais.The program comprises four main training categories:job search skills,job specific skills, general skills, and tailor-made programs for the disabled and the elderly. In 2003, the Employee Retraining Board offered mover than 103000 training places to assist eligible workers, especially displaced workers and the unemployed. The Government has also provided the Youth Pre-employmentTraining Program and the InformationTechnologyAssistant Training Program.The Labor Department has launched a Re-employment Pilot Program for the Middle Aged to provide one-stop employment and counseling service for job-seekers aged 40 and above who have been unemployed for more than three months. 95 STATUS OF EAPS Employee Assistance Programs (EAP) emerged in Hong .Kong during the late 1980.s. Prior to that, a few social service agencies had started industrial social work services in several industrial districts.These were short-lived for a lack of funding and long-term commitment on the part of agencies and companies. In 1988, Hong Kong Christian Service started a small scale EAP, the first professionally staffed EAP service in Hong Kong. In the following year, the Hong Kong Council of Social Service organized a study tour to the Unified States of America specially to learn about American EAPs. Members of this group returned with new information which they used to launch new EAPs. After a two year trial, Hong Kong Christian Service formally launched its Employee Development Scheme (EDS) in 1990. Another program is Yang Memorial Methodist Social Service's Employee Enrichment Program which was launched in 1991. A few more .organizations in the social service agencies started their EAPs in the following years. The first company in the private.sectpc:starte,d -to start an EAF was;pE!~K Cn;or~i~.~r~, own~~xd by Dr.Rose Ong,who in 1992 initiated a program based on the US profit EAP. Human Dynamic Consultants was established in 1993, and is a private for-profit EAP. From the beginning of 21st century, it is observed that there are a growing number of organizations in the social service agencies, individual professionals, and international EAP company have joined the EAP field in Hong Kong. Moreover, there are increasing number of corporations have developed their businesses in major cities of China, such as 6eijing, Shanghai, and Gua,ngtong province: A few local EAP providers like Hong Kong Christian Service have already extended their service in China. SERVICES PERFORMED Most of the EAPs are external service. The providers have adopted abroad -brush approach to provide service for individual employees, company management, and the organization as a whole.The services encompass: Hotline and counseling service in relation to work, personal, and family issues Personal development programs such as stress management, emotion management Training and educational programs on management skills Management consultation on staff and organizational issues Critical incident stress management and post trauma counseling Outplacement and relocation assistance Supportive services including work-based child care centers and occupational health FINANCING AND EAP PROFESSIONALS Majority of the external EAPs are financed by the contract fees received from the employers. Almost majority of the EAPs professionals are trained in either social work or counseling, There are only a few providers like Hong Kong Christian Service has their in-house psychologists and support services like child care centers, vocational training center, and clinic services. USERS Today, EAPs exist in both private and public organizations. Most of the major employers in pubic utilities, banking, tertiary institutions, transport, information technology and telecommunication, retail industries have used EAPs. In 1997, Hong Kong Christian Service commissioned the Hong Kong Productivity Council to conduct a market and strategy review. in this study, 30 current and prospective user organizations were interviewed. It was found that the organizations used EAP due to three major factors: 1:Managementphilosophy \u2014many or., ~ ;,~ti,,r;~ ar<<\u00b0 as a result of increasing competition.Theyare moving from a traditional style to a culture which emphasized the responsibility of individual employees for company performance.These organizations regard EAP as a demonstration of the value that they attached to the individual employee; 2.Operational concerns \u2014more organizations have recognized stress as a consequence of organizational change, and EAPs were regarded as an integral part of their corporate stress management procedures.5ome organuations provide EAPs because the nature of their business is inherently stressful or dangerous,They have found that there was a clear link between stress management and reduced risk of accidents; 3.Benefirs \u2014some organizations regard EAPs as primarily a benefits issue.They are committed to monitor the practice of competitors closely, in order to ensure that if such programs were provided more widely, they could modify their own benefits packages in order to remain competitive. As reflected by the growing market in EAPs in the early 21st century, it is evidenced that the contribution of EAP is well receipted by the management of the public and private companies. Many managers acknowledged that employees' personal and work-related issues are important issues in human resource management. It is generally agreed that EAP brings business positive results in lower staff turnover, lower accident rates, preventing the occurrence of traumatic incident, higher productivity, more committed and loyal employees, and an enhanced reputation for the employer. FUTURE TREND OF EAPS In tMe wake of the economic recession since 2001, Hong Kong faces social and workforce issues which has not been experienced in the past. The unemployment rate surges to a historical high as a result of company reengineering and ~~ relocation to lower labor cost countries. There are strong demand from the community for more protections for the unemployed, and creation of more new jobs from the government, Under the present staggered economic environment, many staff are faced with tremendous amount of stress and strain, whether from personal, family or changes in workplace. From the prole of the end users of EDS in 2002-2003, approximately 50% of the end users suffered from emotional disturbances and mental health problems, such as mood disorder and anxiety disorder. These staff problems, if not properly handled, will not only damage the physical and psychological health of staff, it will also undermine the efficiency and effectiveness of the entire organization. Fortunately, there are an increasing number of employers come to aware of the need to provide assistance to the staff under stress. They also recognized the role and values of EAP in assisting employees to resolve personal and work issues, which provides a strong impetus for the mushrooming of EAPs, It is expected that the number of businesses which adopt EAPs as core employee benefits will continue to grow, and the future development of EAP in Hong Kong is undoubtedly promising. 98 RESOURCES AND EAP PROVIDERS Mr Stanley Lau Ms Jess Leung General Manager Acting Manageress Employee Development Service Corporate Empowerment Service Hong Kong Christian Service The Methodist Centre 33 Granville Road 3/F, 22 Hennessy Road Kowloon Hong Kong SAR China Wanchai Eric Kung Ms Pao Sau Yee Chairman &CEO Project Officer Human Dynamic Asia Pacific Limited Employer Network and Development Project OfFice B & C, t Oth Floor, Knutsford 10, S.K.H.

The wafiershed in the economic development of the country was the introduction of market-oriented reforms in 1991,These reforms have led to privatization of certain state enterprises, higher growth rates, lower inflation, and reduction in trade barriers that protected domestic enterprises thus making India more attractive to global investors. While its GDP is low in dollar terms, India has the world's largest GNP (US Department of State, 2000). The Indian state has articulated the responsibility to safeguard the right of its citizens to the fundamental prerequisites of survival, Since independence, the government \u2014ostensibly driven by socialisfiic goals\u2014has expressed its intentions to discharge this responsibility in one five-year plan after the other. STATUS OF EAPS EAP as conceived in E~irone and America has still not gained currency in India. However, the spirit behind SAP is seen in the Factories Act of 1948, the Plantations Labour Act of 1951 and the Mines Act of 1952. These Acts provide for the appointment of the prescribed number of Welfare officers in every Factory and Mine where five hundred or more workers are ordinarily employed, and similarly in every Plantation where three hundred or more workers are employed. Welfare officers have been entrusted with the duties of supervision (of welfare programs, of redress of workers' grievances, of grant of leave with wages as provided); counseling to workers (for personal and family problems, adjustment to work environments, understanding rights and privileges); advisory to management (in formulating labor and welfare policies, developing fringe benefits, workers' education); liaison with workers (to understands limitations at work, to interpret company policies, to maintain harmonious relations in the plant); liaison with management (to appreciafie workers' viewpoints, to intervene on behalf of workers); liaison with workers and management (to maintain harmonious relations, to improve productive efficiency); liaison with outside agencies (to meet with officers and inspectors for proper enforcement of various Acts, to help workers to make use of community services) (Siddiqui & Sukhra~mani,2001). By providing for a Welfare Officer to act as an advisor, counselor, mediator, and liaison to both labor and management, Indian labor legislation has legally ensured the availability of employee assistance programs for workers in various sectors like manufacturing, mines, and plantations. 101 ROLE OF THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT The government of India has been instrumental in providing basic social security net and health facilities to employees in India. 39,498,611 employees were beneficiaries of the Employee Provident Fund as of 3/31/03 (Annual Report 2002-03, Employee Provident Fund Corporation). Programs such as Employees State Insurance Scheme (ESIS), Central Government Health ,Scheme (CGHS), and employer -based schemes cover the low-income formal sector. Under the ESIS, 7,754,450 employees have been covered (Annual Report 2000-01, Employees' State Insurance Corporation). Many Public Sector companies like Cochin PortTrust and Kochi Refineries Ltd provide medical benefits to the employee and the spouse even after retirement. The National Maternity Benefit Scheme under the National Social Assistance Program had allocated Rs 9278.11 lakhs in the year 1999-2000 which has benefited 1,224,832 women (Annual Report 2000-01, Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Government of India). One of the major reasons for tie r~, yin, i:;, health since independence has been the development of an impressively vast, three-tiered system of rural health infrastructure. The. system features Sub-Centers for each 5,000 population, Primary Health Centers (PHC) for each 30,000 population; and Community Health Centers (CHC) for each 100,000 population (India Health Report, 2003). According to the National Human Development Report 2001, the per capita government expenditure (Current and Capital) on Health in India is Rs 167. The Indian government has recognized the need to address the problem of drug abuse.The Prohibition and Drug Abuse Prevention 1 program set u~ 80,787 counseling centers and 81,857 de-addiction centers by 1999. Similarly, under the same scheme 48 de-addiction camps were organized which benefited 1,595 people (Annual Report2001 -1002, Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment,Govt.of India). ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY The apex body of Judiciary in India, the Supreme Court, while giving its verdict in Vishaka vs Union of {ndia, offered a significant contribution to progress against sexual harassment in the workplace.The Supreme Court has made it the duty of the employer to deter and prevent workplace acts of sexual harassment. If such acts are committed, the employer must ensure resolution and prosecution.To facilitate this procedure the Court has provided for the establishment of a committee in every organization, with women forming at least half of its members. The committee is to be led by a woman, and it should involve other experts on issues of sexual harassment, to ensure a fair and timely treatment of each case (Srivastava, S.C.,2004).The Supreme Court and other High Courts (apex body of Judiciary in a State) in India have risen to the occasion and championed the cause of working women by evolving immediately implementable law and by imposing stringent punishment in cases of sexual harassment at work (Indian Factories and Labor Reports, 2004). OCCUPATIONAL SOCIAL WORK IN INDIA \"~ Conceptually the scope of social work in a workplace is seen as counseling; organization of support groups; training and 102 staff development; developing linkages between the individual and community and between the management and the employee; and creating a fit between the needs and development of workers and the goals of the organization. In India occupational social work has come to be identified with industrial social work, and this is concentrated primarily in the organized sector. Large unorganized sectors constituting the construction industry, carpet manufacturing units, quarries and agriculture- dependent activities have remained outside the focus of social workers.The Committee on Labor Welfare, constituted in 1966, highlighted this gap and recommended the provision of basic welfare amenities for the unorganized sector, However, the proposal has not been implemented (Siddiqui & Sukhramani, 2001). Social work education in India started in 1936. When the Factories Act of 1948 was passed the job opportunities increased for the holder of a diploma or a degree in the industrial relations and personnel management (Marlatt & Mastrofini,1996). With the statutory provision fora \".welfare officer\" in organizations the graduating social workers found employers ready to take therr~ in.l he availability of employers led to the development of this discipline in academia.The scope of the work initially was limited to providing basic welfare facilities. it later expanded to include industrial relations, personnel management and human resource management (Siddiqui & Sukhramani, 2001). Social workers in an organization perform varied functions, including Labor welfare, personnel and public relations.The overlapping of managerial work and social work has been a source of debate over the exact scope and area of social work (Siddiqui & Sukhramani, 2001). While analyzing the nature of occupational social work in India, Siddiqui and Sukhramani (2001) developed two models which characterize the delivery point of welfare services.These two models are institutional (where the work is executed within the premises of the organization) and community based (where the focus is not just the worker but the family of the worker; thus, the work is executed in the community). Within the institutional model, a distinction can be made between the work done by the welfare officer who is a trained social worker and undertakes Labor welfare functions, the work of human resource development, and the work of a social worker who is employed to actually deliver the welfare services. The welfare officer is expected to facilitate the fulfillment of obligations under the Factories Act of 1948. Within the institutional setting of social work practice there has been a development of a new field called \"human resource development;\" it is geared toward the improvement of skills and career advancement of the employees. The statutory protection and the strong worker-bias of the welfare officer have made it quite unpopular with management. The appointment of a\"welfare officer\" is seen as a necessary evil, and is usually isolated from the activities of the organization. Generally, a parallel appointment is made in an organization under the name of \"personnel officer,\" \"human resource development officer;'or \"industrial relations officer.\" While negotiating on behalf of the employees these officers also try to advance the position of the management. The nature and philosophy of an organization is what determines whether the choice is for an \"industrial relations officer\" (here the workforce is seen as a source of trouble and so the primary interest is maintenance of harmonious relations within 103 the organization) or a \"human resource development officer\" (here the employees are seen as a resource of the organization\u2014 a resource which can be developed and improved, rather than managed; this benefits the individual worker and the organization). Social workers intervene in the community setting when the industry expresses a social responsibility not only to the community of its workers' families but also to the community sometimes adopted by certain industrial and business organizations. A significant example features the welfare programs undertaken by the South India Plantation operation of Tata Tea.This kind of intervention might decrease in future,as land scarcity might lead to scattered accommodation of the workforce rather than the setting up of colonies for employees (as had been generally done till now). Another remarkable example in this front is the Textile Labor Association (TLA), Ahmedabad.lt is the oldest and the largest federation for the various textile mill employees' unions in India.TLA has been quite active in organizing Labor welfare activities, and spent a major part of its income on \"social betterment schemes\" (Punekar, S.D et al, 1996). Bombay Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI), one of the leading Employers' Association and Avert Society have together produced the manual on \"HIV/AIDS Management at the work place\"which is aimed at encouraging industries to take initiative and responsibility for. HIV/AIDS prevention programs. Several Indian companies such as L & T, Glaxo,Tata Tea,Tata Steel, SAIL, Apollo Tyres, and Bajaj Auto have successfully launched preventive efforts in this regard. (Bombay Chamber Bulletin, August 2004). EAP PROVIDERS IN INDIA SantulanEAP SantulanEAP is a pioneer in providing responsive, caring and effective employee -assistance programs.

(We would like to thank Ms Shireen Chitran, Director, Singapore branch office for providing us with the relevant information and details.) Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (M&M) Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (M&M),the flagship company of the Mahindra Group of companies, is one of the largest private sector companies in India, and amongst the top ten industrial houses in India. As a core business value, M&M believes that its human resources are its richest assets,and thus the wealth generated by the Company must go towards the enrichment of its people.As a part of M&M's contribution to the social sector the Company is implementing various programs along with community members, staff, trade union workers, NGOs, Government institutions, academic and medical institutions. Projects have been initiated in the areas of education and training by providing quality education to various age groups and socio-economic classes. A special emphasis is on the education of underprivileged female children in urban and rural areas. Other areas of support include health, social welfare, environment, income generation, special projects for the physically and mentally challenged, and disaster relief. In order to ensure the good health of its employees, the Company has initiated activities on nutrition family planningand sex education and social awareness on various issues such as AIDS, Cancer, Diabetes, and heart care. Regular health check ups and awareness initiatives are undertaken for the communities around the plants as well.After natural calamities contributions in the form of medical and other relief are managed bythe Mahindra Foundation. M&M is the chief sponsor of this foundation. Larsen & Toubro Limited (L&T) Larsen & Toubro Limited (L&T) is one of the largest groups of companies in the private sector in India. A firm with multi-dimensional engineering capabilities, it's been established in India since 1938. It is atechnology- driven company with leading edge capabilities in fields related to infrastructure and basic industries. 105 Social welfare and responsibility has been one of the prime concerns of the company, The activities are not limited to employee welfare but have been extended to cater to the overall well being of the employees, the working community, and the family. L&T has activities for employees and their communities in the areas of population control, community development, income generation, literacy and education, preventive health, maternal and childcare, tuberculosis and leprosy control, environment issues, substance abuse and addiction, and agriculture. There is an established and dedicated infrastructure for medical and welfare services including hospitals at all factory locations in India. Additionally, there is a well-equipped diagnostic centre for specialty consultations for employees and their families in Mumbai. Activities related to reproductive and maternal and child health programs are provided free of cost to the community. The welfare programs of the company are implemented through various mechanisms, with employee and community participation central to all. Key implementation strategies and approaches include peer based programs, training of trainers, community mobilization, networking with other service providers, and volunteering by staff and their families. Tata Tea The welfare and the well being of Tata Yea's large workforce -about 59,000 employees and their families drawn largely from the weaker sections of society-is of paramount importance to the company.The company has put in dedicated effort and large expenditures, entirely voluntary, which have gone into upgrading the quality of life of the workforce.The South India and the North India Plantation Operation ofTata Tea have made operational a number of welfare projects directed at the. educational (basic education, technical training schools), health (general hospital, health camps), welfare and community needs (rehabilitation centers for handicapped children and youth, environment conservation) of their employees and the employees'families. The company maintains excellent teams in football, power lifting, table tennis and athletics. Yet another non-statutory welfare measure undertaken by the Company is the promotion of the Bharat Scouts and Guides Movement among the children of its employees.This is perhaps the only instance of a corporate house promoting such activities and is unparalleled in the history of the movement. CURRENT ISSUES IN/SCOPE OF EAP The provision of a statutory position of \"welfare officer\" by the Indian government has produced the development of the discipline of occupational social work.lndia has trained professionals in industrial work human relations, psychology,training and psychiatry. The presence of this resource of ready talented professionals gives a lot of scope for the development of EAPs in India. Liberalization of the economy has resulted in a change in the nature of work, workforce, and workplace. Employees increasingly require counseling in family relationships and particularly in maintaining a balance between work and Iife.This has opened up great avenues for an effective intervention by EAP providers. 106 The Indian Call Centre Industry has been growing at amind- boggling rate of around 60%annually over the last three years. The revenue from this sector has grown from around $565 million in 1999-2000 to more than $3 billion by March 2004. Revenue is protected to increase beyond $10 billion by 2006. Employment in this sector has increased from 1,40,000 in March 2003 to over 2,00,000 by 2004. In the midst of the celebration of the opportunities that the outsourcing has created,. recent research (Datta, R.C., 2004; Ramesh, B. P., 2004) highlights the monotonous and repetitive nature of the work, management and organization of the workplace with the help of new information technology to provide control over the pace of work, quality of work, performance at work and the complete lack of private space. The impact of these concerns is reflected in the health of the call center workers. Some of the health problems identified among the call center workers include: higher obesity and diabetes rates among night-shift workers higher disorder rates compared with higher-level employees more susceptibility to peptic ulcers, more vulnerable to driving problems with 20 percent more likely to have serious accidents, high rates of miscarriages and hormonal problems among women (Doshi, A. & Ravindran. N,2004). Unlike regulations governing factories, plantations, mines, and docks and ports in India, with the call centre industry there is no regulation creating a statutory requirement for Welfare officers in the workplace. Call centre industry, Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) centers, and IT enabled services CITES) are governed by the Shops and Commercial establishment Act which varies from State to State in India. EAP Providers in India can hook for a large number of small'and medium call centers, BPOs, and ITES which cannot or will not provide EAPs of their own. According to Chitran (2004) the increased mobility of and opportunities for the young is putting a strain on the traditional roles and structures of family and gender relations. Moreover, the constant need of modern organizations to keep abreast of the competition has made employees vulnerable.These processes have opened the field for the greater participation of EAP providers.Chitran points out that, if assured of confidentiality, Indians would be open to the idea of EAP as Indians are considered pro-learning and interested in self-improvement. One area that needs clarification is the legal aspect. With the Indian law providing for in-house welfare schemes for employees, the status of outsourcing of EAP to an outside agency needs legal credibility before EAP providers in India can develop effectively. 107 RESOURCES AND EAP PROVIDERS Dr.Ashwani Kumar Director Santulan EAP F-60,Bali Nagar, Near Raja India Shireen Chitran Director, Singapore Branch Office Dynamic EAP South Pacific Pte Limited 65 Chulia Street, #49-OS OCBC Regional Manager Human Dynamic India Pvt Ltd 1st Floor, World Trade Towers DBS Corporate Center Barakhamba Lane, Operation Tata Tea Post Box No 9, Munnar, Kerala 685 IR Northindia Plantation Operation Tata Tea 1 Bishop Lefroy 020, Email;str- bw@bw.ltindia.com Mrs. S.

AZLY, ADE S. KOSALA BACKGROUNQ The Indonesian archipelago totals some 17,000 islands and includes mountains, active volcanoes, dense jungles, tropical rain forests, and some of the most beautiful and treacherous landscapes in the world, The population and culture of this region is diverse, and its 235 million inhabitants represent 350 ethnic and tribal groups who speak more than 250 different languages and dialects. The first known human of the archipelago was'Java Man;'or Homo Erectus, who lived here more than one-half million years a~~o. For centuries, Indonesia was a center for Southeast Asian conimeree and trade as its ~r-~U~~ ~ ~I ~ ~as~~;~rr~~ r: use 9\u00b0E e~~ of the richest regions of the world. The spice trade brought the Portuguese to Indonesia in the 1500s. At this time, cloves, nutmeg and mace were believed to cure everything from the plague to venereal disease, and they were thought to be worth their weight in gold. Later, the Dutch gained control of the spice trade from the Portuguese, and the Dutch East India Company established a trade monopoly that lasted well into the 18th century. During the 19th century, the Dutch began cultivating sugar and coffee on Java and soon they were producing most of the world's supply of coffee.Today, crude oil and natural gas are Indonesia's most valuable resources and this region is still one of the largest producers of rubber. it was trade with India, China, and Southeast Asia that first exposed the people of Indonesia to outside cultural and religious influence. First on the scene were Buddhist and Hindu traders and monks. By the eighth century, Muslim traders had arrived and began to spread their religion, Islam, to the people. By the time Marco Polo arrived in North Sumatra during the thirteenth century, the first Islamic states had already been established. Islam spread rapidly, and today almost ninety percent of the population of Indonesia is Muslim, making it the largest Islamic nation in the world. During the mid-twentieth century, after more than three hundred years of oppressive colonial rule, Indonesians finally challenged the Dutch presence.The Nationalists engaged in a four-year war against the Dutch and succeeded in bringing about independence to the Republic of Indonesia on August 17,1945. Post-independence, President Soekarno was the first Indonesian leader, in 1967, Soeharto eased Soekarno from power and Indonesia's economy grew steadily, almost exclusively through the exportation of oil. In 1997, the Asian financial crisis erupted and paralyzed the Indonesian economy;the Indonesian currency,the Rupiah lost 80% of its value against the U.S. dollar.Today, Indonesia continues to experience high unemployment and inflation despite the region's economic rebound in 2000. 110 Since 1997, Indonesia has had three different presidents: B.1. Habibe; Megawati Soekarnoputri, who will lead the country until the next elections this year, 2004. After thirty-two years in power, Soeharto resigned amid violence and riots in 1998. But Indonesians have persisted in their quest for democracy, and during 1999 the country held its first democratic election with \"Gus Dur\" Wahid elected as President. This \"free\" election was a benchmark for the country after more than three decades of authoritarian rule. However, political turmoil is predicted for the 2004 elections. The road to democracy has been a long ane for Indonesia, but its people are determined to succeed. THE PROFESSION OF PSYCHOLOGY The teaching of psychology got a late start in Indonesia and the profession's origins are rooted in serving both business and societal needs. In 1951, Professor Slamet Iman Santoso introduced Industrial and Organizational Psychology as a division. within the Department of Culture ;and Education. This new +division b ~!<:s+ ry ;:nnr~;;ct:i~~g ,~s ~~hological assessments to better select Indonesian students desiring to study abroad. Its staff also tested job applicants to help both the government and business to hire more capable people. In Indonesia, this program was referred to as \"helping employers get the right man in the right place': When the Dutch left Indonesia, Indonesian workers were generally inexperienced, untrained and poorly educated. But the new government was responsible for ~Iling positions vacated by the Dutch. These opportunities for Indonesian workers were found in government, the military, the police, as wei( as in areas of management and administration. Psychologists were instrumental in assuring that the most appropriate people were hired. The chief of the Ministry of Culture and Education asked Professor Slamet Iman Santoso to develop a professional psychology education program at the university Ievel.This Program began as the Indonesian Institute of Psychology, and for the first time students were able to obtain a bachelor's level degree in the field of psychology. In 1960, the division's name was changed to the Faculty of Psychology, University of Indonesia, and Professor Santoso became its first Dean, In 1970, another psychology program was implemented within the university. Named the Lembaga Psikologi Terapan (LPT-UI), this program was developed to provide Human Resource managers with psychologists who could help them in additional areas of need. In response, the professional psychology curriculum at the university was expanded to include training in marital, family, and individual counseling. The program also provided specialties in training and education, in addition to its original services of recruitment, selection and psychological testing.This new curriculum was similar to and complimented the\"broad-brush\"training that psychologists in the United States received before entering the EAP profession. Mental health services in Indonesia also received a boost from the media. The late Professor Mulyono Gandasubrata hosted a television show called \"Psikologi untuk Anda\" (\"Psychology for You\"). It became one of the most popular talk shows on Indonesian television. Actors performed vignettes that depicted typical family situations (such as marital problems and challenges faced in parenting adolescents) and offered practical advice and potential solutions. This program provided anon-threatening way for Indonesians to learn about psychology. It also introduced them to local psychologists. Unfortunately, this program was discontinued after Mulyono Gandasubrata's death. At present, the University of Indonesia offers a full range of educational programming and is considering developing a special curriculum for Employee Assistance (EAP). Today, there are more than forty universities in Indonesia, many with Departments of Psychology, and students can obtain Bachelors, Masters and Doctoral level degrees in this field. In Jakarta alone there are currently more 1500 studenfis studying psychology. As mental health services became more acceptable (yet only slightly less stigmatized), the delivery of services moved from the University to the community, Many Psychology graduates began working first in agencies, later opening their own .f S~iYr: private practices. Today people can receive counseling in public and private clinics, hospitals, schools, crisis centers, and (again) through television and radio broadcasts. For those uncomfortable with going to a psychologist in person there is now a popular 24-hour hotline, called \"Hotline Service Bersama \". BARRIERS TO SEEKING HELP Despite a growing awareness of the \"need for treatment,\" Indonesians remain hesitant to seek professional assistance for persona{ and family prouiEnu, i he greatest barrier coritinues ro be the sfiigma associated with mental iiiness.The degree of stigma and treatment are heavily influenced by the person's own level of education and general awareness of problems, his/her socio-economic status, age, sex, ethnicity, and (important in Indonesia) his/her area or region of residence. Rural areas of the country remain the most difficult, Indonesians continue to view themselves as reflections of their family and their family's history, often interpreting mental illness as a form of punishment for something that either they or their family members have done. Within some ethnic groups, it is still a belief that mental health problems are caused by evil spirits.ln colonial times, people with mental illness were simply referred to as \"lunatics \"and were cared for privately and secretly by the family.5ome continue to believe that mental illness is a disgrace and that seeking help for personal problems is a weakness. When Indonesians experience life problems, they prefer to talk to someone they know such as an older, wiser, or experienced family member or friend. It is simply far less culturally acceptable to share personal problems with strangers. Because of these cultural biases, it remains common for Indonesians to seek help for physical problems when their actual problems may be emotional in nature.lndonesians will often wait until their personal situation has escalated to a crisis, expecting only advice and a quick solution from their medical professional or psychologist counselor. 112 In more recent years, Indonesian mental health professionals have worked hard to overcome the stigma associated with psychological. treatment. The media (television, radio, talk shows, magazines, newspapers and Internet sites) have also played an important role in de-stigmatizing mental health services. There has been a marked increase in community awareness of the issue, and psychologists have developed special outreach programs to help the Indonesian people to more effectively deal with traumatic events such as the on-going war in Aceh, the Bali bombing of 2002, and the Marriott bombing in Jakarta in 2003. However, there is still much to be done before counseling will be fully embraced and supported bythe Indonesian people. SrArus of EAPs The concept of Employee Assistance as an \"early problem identification and intervention\" program (using work performance to direct employees with personal problems to the help they need) is a new business concept in Indonesia. Some U.S, companies, including ConocoPhillips more\"family support \"in nature and focus and have at best been a weak link to that\"holy grail\"of EAP\u2014work performance. And, while expatriate support services are well received and have proven valuable to a company's \"bottom line\"by helping families to assimilate and adapt more quickly,they are simply not (nor should they be) EAP Yet the services that multinational corporations provide to their expatriates continue to expose Indonesian workers to the facts: personal problems have a high rate of prevalence, are much more \"normal\" than ever realized, and need to be recognized and managed at the earliest possible time.. A few U.S. and other external EAP companies and managed care groups also have recently contracted to work with expatriate multinationals based in Indonesia. These EAP/managed care companies, often located in the home country, telephonically refer expatriates to a number of \"local\" network providers in Indonesia. Again, these are not. EAP, as such, because they do not have a \"local\" presence, and they do not provide either an employee orientation program or direct training of managers and supervisors in the mechanics of the program or their role in making referrals. In addition, most of these groups have no ties whatsoever to the in-country workplace or to in-country management. Emergent situations, \"critical incidentsare most often handled through both corporate and local Human Resources and either the company's corporate EAP or an external company like those mentioned above, with actual services provided by a local contracted psychologist or other such service provider. Of great significance, \"local\" or Indonesian national employees have only recently been given Benefits packages that help them to pay for (and include coverage for) mental health treatment or counseling services.This will greatly facilitate the utilization of counseling and family services and should help to promote the future implementation of full service EAP for Indonesian workers. 113 In 2004, ConocoPhillips contracted with Iradat Konsultan to provide the first actual Indonesian Employee Assistance Program for national employees. IradaYs psychologists were given extensive training in Jakarta on the concept of EAP and its delivery by ConocoPhillips' corporate EAP representative, and considerable program promotion was undertaken prior to program implementation. They are also an affiliate provider for Human Dynamic Asia Pacific. To date, the Iradat Konsultan is still the only company providing EAP for Indonesian workers in the country. In 2004, ConocoPhillips also contracted with the International Community Activity Center (ICAC) of Jakarta to provide EAP for its expatriate workers and their families. Like Iradat Konsultan this was the first such contract for ICAC to provide the full range of EAP services.While the group has been a provider of expatriate counseling services for more than twenty years, ConocoPhillips also provided them with extensive EAP training and support prior to program implementation. The current political and economic climate in Indonesia provides fertile grounei_ for EAP development. In addition to normal stress and strain, Indonesians have had to deal with extreme violence, political uncertainty and the devastating Asian economic crisis that began in 1997 and from which Indonesia has not yet fully recovered. The Bali bombing in October 2002 and the Marriott Bombing in August of 2003 simply add to these concerns. It is hoped that these difficulties enable multinationals (doing business here) to realize the relevance and importance of providing EAP services to ail of their national as well as their expatriate workforce. EAP PROVIDERS 1.Iradat Konsultan As previously stated, Iradat Konsultan is the only current Indonesian provider to offer full-service EAP.They were originally founded in 1983 to assist organizations in improving their Human Resource function.Today, their staff includes fourteen psychologists (some part-time) in their counseling and EAP department, three psychologists in the outplacement department and an organizational development group. The name\"Iradat\"means \"a strong will and relentless effort;'which certainly characterizes the staff and the group's operating philosophy. This company provides a full range of Human Resource services including HR Consultation, Employee Recruitment and Selection, Psychological Evaluation, Outplacement,Training, Education, and Research.They also provide Organizational Qevelopment services such as Team Building, Myers-Briggs Training, Leadership, and Coaching and Counseling. In 2000, Iradat added Employee Assistance Program (EAP) services to its menu of offerings and in 2002 they added Cross- Cultural Adaptability Assessment.The Iradat professionals have also been trained in Critical Incident Debriefing and Iradat has a 24/7 country -wide toll-free access number and mobile phones to assure staff availability. IradaYs staff are available for face-to-face and/or telephone counseling and they can travel offshore (when necessary). 114 iradat Konsultan also provides customized services to its clients. For instance, for ConocoPhillips, Iradat's counselors come on-site twice weekly, All of the Iradat consultants are bi-lingual (fluent in English as well as Bahasa Indonesian), but at this time iradat's EAP and counseling clients are primarily Indonesian nationals. 2. International Community Activity Center (ICAC) ICAO was founded in the 1970's to provide a safe, and drug-free environment for teenagers. Originally named \"Agape House; the center was chartered and registered with the Indonesian government as a charitable non-profit organization with initial funding partially provided by the U.S. State Department. At it's peak, the services offered by ICAC included a Community Orientation Program to assist expatriate families to adjust to life in Jakarta. They also offered educational programs, a gym facility, and the center functioned as a hub of social events for expatriates. At one time, ICAC had a bustling counseling center with 6;ta8:mental health pref~ssionals on sty at,_ ~ s-:ry s -,~:; , ~w.,;,~ies were well utilized by the local-expatriate community. While multinational corporations have made referrals to ICAC for counseling, the Center has really never been an EAP service in the true sense. For example, the ICAC staff have not provided services such as manager /supervisor training, employee intervention, or management consultation, and they have not, until just recently, been organizationally focused. In recent years, ICAC has gone through some challenging times and there have been several leadership changes and some reduction in services. Escalating political instability and the Asian financial crisis have caused some multinationals to reduce the number of expatriates they assign to Indonesia. With the reduction in expatriate numbers came a resultant reduction in funding support for ICAC, and its current staff numbers reflect this reduction in funds. There has, though, recently been another change in Board membership for ICAC,and the current Board of Directors are quite optimistic about the Center's future. The new Board has made a firm commitment to focus its attention and support for the Center's most viable offering -counseling and relocation /orientation services for expatriate families. At this time, ICAC has two Australian mental health professionals on staff,Annette Akred,AASW,works prlmarilywith adults, adolescents, couples and families.Jeny Piva, B. Psych.; MCP, works with children and adolescents and families, and provides assessment and psychological testing as well.Of note, both of these psychologists have current and proper residential and work Visas as psychologists and both have fully met all government requirements for their working at ICAC. ICAC and its staff are now very committed to strengthening their services in the area of Employee Assistance Programming. 115 Ita D, Azly, Psi.

The economy is still one of the best performing in the European Union (EU), and although the growth rate has reduced from 10% to 5% per annum the Irish economy is regarded as \"the envy of Europe.\" Interest in EAPs continues to grow, driven by the impact of the stresses on the working population, an expanding economy, and the challenge of attempting to balance. workand person! !ife. In acldi*+gin ~hnr~ ~~~ ! gal obligations on employers under the Safety, Health &Welfare at Work Act 1989 (Under Review) to prevent employees from exposure to work stress (overload), critical incident stress, post traumatic stress disorder, workplace violence and workplace bullying. The new Safety, Health &Welfare at Work Act 2005 is due to become law in June 2005 and will replace the existing Iegislation.The Act will require that employees must not be under the influence of an intoxicant (defined as alcohol and drugs) to the extent that they endanger themselves or others and submit to tests conducted under the supervision of a doctor.The new Equality Act 2004 extends rights to older workers, domestic workers, and some immigrant workers. It is intended to protect many eastern European and Asian domestic. workers (hired by wealthy Irish hottseholdsl who may have been exploited in recent years. The evolution of EAPs has centered on employee counselling; the future of EAPs lies in integrating EAPs as part of the Human Resource function to manage poor performance and safety risks in line with legislation. This article will outline the current business climate in Ireland, recent and pending legislation, and Ireland's relationship with the EU and the US.This article will also focus on current issues and trends in EAP development and relevant issues in the workplace, including occupational social work. BACKGROUND Ireland is one of the most successful economies in Europe. It has a total population of just under 4 million with 2 million in the workforce. Increasingly, Ireland will require immigrant workers to continue its economic growth and provide social insurance contributions to cover future pension liabilities. It is fast becoming amulti- cultural society with 61,000 citizens from the 10 new member states registered with the Irish tax department since May 2004.This includes 30,000 from Poland, 14,000 from Lithuania and 6,700 from Latvia.lreland has the second highest GDP after Luxembourg at \u20ac25,100 per capita. The current growth rate stands at 5%,inflation at 2%and unemployment at 4.5%.The Euro (current rate \u20ac1 = U5 $1.26) is the currency used in Ireland and shared with many of its EU Partners. Although there has been a decline in Trade Union 117 membership in recent years, it is still strong in some industries \u2014particularly in the Pubic Service. Manufacturing companies in Ireland now have high labor costs and are losing some of their traditional operations to low cost economies such as the new EU Member States and China.Current government strategy is that Ireland will develop from an industrial economy to a knowledge -based economy and that all new business parks will include a family friendly resource centre for childcare. Ireland has been a member of the European Union since 1972 and this is one of the factors in its current success. It has gained from access to larger markets and EU structural funds, which now partially fund the National Development Plan 2000-2006. IRELAND \u2014SMALL MEMBER OF A LARGE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY The Lisbon agenda set the goal for the EU to be the world's largest economy by 2010.This is seen as ambitious and a more realistic target is now put at 2020. During Ireland's Presidency of the EU in 2004.,10 new members joined the existing 15 member states in Dublin,op:the;1st.of Max;,to bring the t~~~' ?c, <,:,.~:~ ~~ \" i:iillion,The ten new members were mainly from the former Eastern block countries. Romania and Bulgaria are now set for accession to the EU in 2007. They will be followed by Macedonia,Turkey, and Croatia.This will create one of the largest global trading blocks, increasing the EU population to approximately 650 million. The EU issues directives that are the most important legislative instrument used by the Union.The purpose of directives is to create a uniform or whole EU approach to an issue such as labor Law while still respecting the traditions and needs of rtl~r'~i%>er stetes. in other words, directives Harmonize the iaw across ine EU and iron oUT inconsistencies so That, as Tar as possible, the same conditions exist for all citizens in all member states. There have been no directives on EAPs. However, there have been directives resulting in Legislation on Health &Safety in Ireland that indirectly assists EAP development. The Safety, Health &Welfare at Work Act 1989 enacted as a result of an EC Directive requires employers to prevenfi exposure to the following hazards: Work Stress (overload) Critical Incident Stress (arising from industrial accidents and' explosions) Workplace Violence Workplace Bullying The Safety, Health &Welfare at Work Act 2005 will provide for employee drug testing and place the obligation on employees to be free from intoxicants (described as alcohol and drugs) while at work. IRELAND \u2014INFLUENCE FROM THE U.S. The strong Irish American links, language, and geographical location influenced the development of the Minnesota model treatment method in Ireland in 1970. Links developed with the Beli Telephone Company and the US Naval Air Station in Jacksonville, Florida resulted in the first European EAP seminar in Dublin in September 1980 and one of the first ALMACA 118 (now EAPA) memberships in Europe. This also led to the development in 1985 of the first external EAP in Europe by Guinness at their Kilkenny plant in Ireland, Ireland benefits from the US with Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) with approximately,25~'o to 3090 of business comprising US Multinationals, Ireland is the number one location in Europe for health care and pharmaceutical companies including Wyeth Medica, Pfizer, Abbott, Boston Scientiflic, and Johnson and Johnson. It also has a key information and communications technology investment from companies such as Microsoft,Dell, and Motorola. Irish companies such as Kerry Foods,Smurfit and CRH have major investments in the US. SOCIAL PARTNERSHIP IN IRELAND AND EAPS The main social partners include the government,employers, and trade unions.ln return for pay moderation and a no strike clause the government and unions agreed to a partnership approach, giving the unions the opportunity to discuss health care, education, and housing as part of national wage agreements. Local partnership groups were established at the enterprise level and influenced the setting up of EAPs and work life programmes, Two good examples of a partnership approach to EAP Development were. (1 J The St. James Hospital Partnership Group was instrumental in setting up an EAP in its hospital; and (2), the Waterford City Council Partnership Group recommended implementation of an EAP based on the Fas Staff Support Scheme for Local Authorities which is in operation in other Local Authorities in Ireland. NEGOTIATION ON A NEW NATIONAL AGREEMENT The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness was formally launched in November 1999 and resulted in the development of a National Framework Committee for the development of family friendly policies at the level of enterprise. A budget of 1,9 million Euro was allocated for this purpose.. DEVELOPMENT OF WORK LIFE PROGRAMMES IN IRELAND Irish Employers are obliged to comply with five main employment laws that impact on work life balance. Failure to do so may lead employees to seek redress with the enforcement agencies such as the Equality Authority. The laws are as follows: Maternity Protection Act 1994 Adoptive Leave Act 1995 Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 Parental Leave 1998 Act (Including Force Majeure) Careers Leave Act 2001 Pending Legislation includes: Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill Adoptive Leave(Amendment) Biil *Fuller explanation of the relevant legislation can be viewed on www.entemp.le 119 The National Framework Committee for the development of Family Friendly Policies was established under the programme for Prosperity and Fairness and organized a series of National seminars to promote the development of Family Friendly working arrangements in the workplace.The Framework Committee members included the Equality Authority, Government Departments, the Irish Business and Employer's Confederation (IBEC), and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), Funded by the committee, IBEC developed a work life balance training module and organized a national roundtable on work life, which took place in November 2002. A new guideline and tool kit for trade unions on family friendly working /work life balance was designed by ICTU,This group also provided training for athree-day training course, which is being delivered to union members. The Equality Authority introduced the first family friendly workplace day on Thursday 1st March 2001. Workplaces were encouraged to have activities to mark that day, and it is now an annual event. ,,,. STATUS OF EAPS The three main sources of education and training for the Employee Assistance Profession in Ireland are the EAP Institute, the EAPA Ireland Chapter, and the National University of Ireland in Galway, Since 1980 the EAP Institute has been conducting a series of national seminars on Designing EAPs, Critical Incident Stress Management, Workplace Bullying and Employee Drug Testing.The Institute also conducts an Annual Conference.This conference is now in its 26th Year and is the longest running EA conference outside of the U,S.The 26th Annual EAP Conference, due to take. place on September 21 and 22, 20n5; will of the Institute, Maurice Quinlan, was one of the original EA Professionals to gain the Certified Employee Assistance Professional (CEAP) credential through the\"grandfather clause'; CERTIFIED EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE CREDENTIAL INTERNATIONAL (CEAP-I) During 2001, The Certified Employee Assistance Certification Commission (EACC) introduced the CEAP-international (CEAP-I) credential, awarded to the international community members upon passing the international version of the CEAP test. CEAP and CEAP-I eligibility requirements are the same. Candidates outside of the U,S., however,take the international version of the CEAP test, which omits the approximately 33 test questions assessing knowledge of U.S.laws and healthcare policies/content specific to U.S. practice. The international version of the exam is further adjusted to meet content specifications; the current version contains 155 questions. The CEAP exam contains 230 questions, 200 of which are scored. The additional questions are being field-tested for possible inclusion on subsequent forms of the CEAP examination. The topic of certification was introduced at the 21st Annual EAP Conference on September 20 and 21, 2000, and as a result, 7 EAP Professionals expressed an interest in the certification process. In November 2000 the EAP Institute attended the EACC International Roundtable meeting in New York. Further information on certification was obtained from e-mail contact-with Jan Paul, Katie Borkowski and Paul Kowatch. This continued with Richard Fisher when he took over the 120 position of Certification Director.The decision was then made by the EAP institute to re-design ali of the training events to meet P.D.H, requirements. Applications were made to the Employee Assistance Certification Commission for the 22nd Annual EAP Conference and all the topics were approved. The EAP Institute presented aone-day seminar \"Certification Programme for EAP Professionals\" on Wednesday, May 22, 2002, at the Stillorgan Park Hotel, Dublin, Ireland.This one day basic seminar was intended to prepare fihose working in the EAP profession who were interested in taking the exam. As a result, a group of seven EA Professionals decided to become CEAP I candidates. Application to commence the advisement process was made to the EACC on November 27, 2002, and Maurice Quinlan was confirmed as an advisor. Another three members of EAPA Ireland commenced peer advisement and in September 2003 the first three Irish EA Professionals \u2014Melissa Darmody, Damian Davv,:and Lorus Colum\u2014 awarded the CEAP-I. Christine Horgan of Norvartis was awarded the LEAP-1 in 2004. Currently, five additional EA Professionals have completed the advisement and are prepared to sit the exam. Another four EA Professionals have commenced advisement. EAPA IRELAND CHAPTER In May 2001, a Chapter of the Empoyee Assistance Professional Association (EAPA) was established in Ireland. As of May 2004, there were 105 members -61 in Government Departments and 44 Private Practitioners, The Government Departments represented were the Health Services Executive, Locai Government, Prison Service, Revenue Commissioners and Semi-State Companies mainly providing internal EAP services.The private practitioners are made up of a cross section providing both internal and external services.The initial growth of EAPS in Ireland was in Government Departments and a recent trend is the accelerated development of external programmes. The Irish EAPA Chapter runs a wide range of seminars on employee counselling including mediation and eating disorders. It also conducts an Annual Conference.The topic of emotional intelligence will be addressed by the Chapter at their Annual Conference on the 26th May in Dublin Castle, in Ireland.The Chapter, in conjunction with the National University of Ireland in Galway, established a certificate and diploma in Employee Assistance and Social Support in 2003. This certificate and diploma is a two year part-time training course for staff working or intending to work in Employee Assistance Programmes (EAPs).The course offers a basic training and the skills and knowledge necessary for filling the role of Employee Assistance Practitioner. The programme is broadly based and involves recognition of very different functions a'nd responsibilities allocated to the EAP support role in different types of enterprises and organizations. The course fee is \u20ac2,400 per annum and contact details will be provided in the resource list. OCCUPATIONAL SOCIAL WORK There are approximately 26 Occupational Social Workers employed by both public and private businesses in Ireland.They 121 provide EA services in Local Government,Teaching, Armed Services and Private Work. Social Workers are not represented in the EA Profession in Ireland to the same extent as the US. Social work education in Ireland is similar to that in the US. Undergraduate schooling for a degree. in social science takes four years and consists of core courses in sociology, economics, psychology, social work practice, and social policy. Depending on the type of position sought, social workers are required to complete a certificate of qualification in social work (CQSW) which is similar to a master's degree in social work. CONCLUSION There have been major developments of EAPs in Ireland since the EAP Compendium was published in 2000, However, little or no research exists to demonstrate EAP market penetration,The stresses associated with a booming economy and new IQgislation combi,ne.tq, place a stronn r~mon,ihi~~t,~ an ~w~r,:;r,,,~,;ers to provide EAPs and work life programmes.There is now an established EAPA Chapter in Ireland providing professional development for its members. The needs of business are changing rapidly and many hard-nosed managers do not see Employee Assistance as part of their human resource function unless they are mandated by legal obligations to provide employee support. Many EAPs in Ireland have evolved separately from the human resource function; the future lies in responding to business needs and integrating EAP into the HR function as an effective means of assisting in the management of poor performance and providing a return on investment.

Suicide has continuously ranked as the sixth most common cause of death since 1997. In each year since 1998, there have been more than 30,000 suicide deaths in Japan. Forthe pastdecade ,workers'compensationhas been awarded to the surviving family of a victim of a work-related suicide. Approximately 200 workers' compensation applications are filed each year seeking compensation for work-related ,. suicides. About haRf c,E rho,? ~,rrli~a% ,r, r:-~s;~;~c in compensation awards to the surviving families.

Workers'stress level 1982 1987 1992 1997 2002 As shown in Figure 2, almost half of Japanese employees reported work-related stress. About one-third of Japanese employees reported stress relating to quality of work and quantity of work, while 29,1% of workers reported stress due to jab security. This latter statistic is a 220% increase over the 13.1%figure in 1997,This increase in stress due to job security appears to reflect the economic recession and the erosion of the lifetime employment system in Japan. 126 Figure 2.

The government is concerned that changes in the economy and industrial structure will further increase the psychological and physical stress on the Japanese workforce: As a result,the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare issued The Guidelines for Workplace Mental Illness in August 2000.The summary of the Guidelines is as follows. 1. MENTAL WELLNESS PLAN Mental health care programs need to be planned from amid- and long-term point of view,)apanese employers should cre- ate a workplace mental wellness policy, which policy should include: (a) Mental wellness system at the workplace; (b) Assessment of workplace problems and implementation of mental health care; (c) External professionals who provide mental health care and resources outside the workplace; (d) Confidentiality and privacy for employees; and (e) Other items necessary and related to the workers' mental wellness plan, 2. IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURES The Guidelines identify the following four methods for implementing mental health care: (a) Self-care. Employees need to become aware of the concept of stress and mental wellness so that they can take preventative action or manage stress on their own. Employers should provide training opportunities for employees 127 in the area of stress awareness and stress management. In addition, employers should create a system that encourages employees to use counseling. (b) Care by managers. Managers should provide counseling or consultation to their subordinates in the area of mental we~iness. Managers need to assess the work environment, work hours and working conditions, and need to take action to improve them. Managers should pay attention to, and try to prevent, an employee's overtime work, excessive fatigue, psychological stress and excessive responsibility, Employers should provide training to managers in the area of mental wellness. (c) Care by internal occupational health resources. The internal occupational health resources staff, such as occupational health physicians and nurses, should assess the work environment and support management efforts to improve it. The occupational health resources staff should assess the workers' stress level and psychological issues and provide consultation during their health consultation sessions. For those who need care by experts, occupational healet~ t~s~:;u;ce s ari s ~vuiu efer the workers to the appropriate resources. Employers need to provide learning opportunities for occupational health resources staff in the area of mental wellness. (d) Care by external resources. External resources provide support for employees who need professional assistance and/or back-to-work assistance for those employees who are on medical leave. Employers should. utilize appropriate external resources. A flow chart showing how to utilize external resources is shown in Figure 3. Figure 3. onsuRation WOP~C @1'S --~ onsuR y ~. Occupational Health R2SOUfC2s rtnerin Polic Making ~ Consukation Employers STATUS ~F EAPS With the fast pace and ever-changing nature of today's corporate workplace, the pressures seem only to mount. As a response to the increasing number of workplace suicide and work-related stress the Japanese chapter of EAPA (Employee Assistance Professionals Association) was established in 2000.The publishing of the government Guidelines for workplace mental wellness is accelerating the development of the EAP field in Japan.The Japanese chapter of EAPA currently has 150 128 members. Of these members, 80%are external EAP providers and 20%are internal occupational health staff. Due to the fast growth of the EAP field in Japan, education and training for EAP professionals is desperately needed. In addition, EAP standards have yet to be formed in Japan. A list of major EAP providers and EAP-related resources in Japan is provided below along with other links related to EAP.

The field of EAP is even more \"alien\" or unknown in this country. This report first will provide brief information about government policies, psychosocial rehabilitation, community mental health services, professional resources (i:e. psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and psychiatric nurses), and insurance policies. Later, the focus will shift to the area of EAP development in Malaysia. GOVERNMENT POLICIES Three separate Mental Health Acts, dating back to 1952, have covered Malaya, Sarawak &Sabah. For almost fifty years, mental health has been the \"stepchild\" of the Ministry of Health. The lack of focus by the government in the area of mental health created a tremendous challenge for the mental health community as it tried to table a new Mental Health Act in the Malaysian parliament for many years. However, in 2000 and 2001, a shift began.The changes stemmed partly from the strong focus on the impact of mental health at the workplace, spearheaded by the World Federation of Mental Health. Awareness increased of the tremendous impact to employees'productivity caused by mental health problems and mental illnesses.Thus, the Ministry of Health began to give a lot of atfiention to many areas of mental health/illnesses.This led to the new Mental Health Act being tabled successfully and approved by the Malaysian parliament in late 2001. PSYCHOSOCIAL REHABILITATION (Focus here is on Day Care facilities.) In the last thirty-five years, very few Day Care facilities. have been available to individuals who suffer from mental illnesses, These facilities are mainly clustered around Kuala Lumpur, the capital city of Malaysia.There is also a large center with a day care program and residential facilities being set up in a northern state of Malaysia (a state named Perak) on a piece of land donated by the state government.This center operates on non-profit basis, and faces many struggles and challenges. In the past fifteen years; more psychiatrists have been trained locally in Malaysia and are available to be posted to various district hospitals throughout the country.This time period also saw the increase of Day Care facilities being set up at these district hospitals. Additionally, over the past seven to eight years many \"Patients Welfare Associations\" have been established, attached to the various Day Care facilities at district hospitals. COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES In the last three decades, various mental health associations have been set up at the state level but such programs have not been available in all the thirteen states within Malaysia. Some of these mental health associations operate only on a 131 very small scale, focusing on mental health awareness and education programs without psychosocial rehabilitation programs. Each of these associations is being managed independently, on non-profit basis, Over the last eight years a Mental Health Council has been established.This serves as a centralized body to bring together all the mental health and patient welfare associations in Malaysia as\"One Voice,\"and the Council receives annual funds-from the Ministry of Health. The Council then distributes the funds to the varipus mental health associations in the country to run their programs. PROFESSIONAL RESOURCES Mental health practitioners in Malaysia include psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, counseling psychologists, social workers and psychiatric nurses. Psychiatrists are strictly regulated under the Medical Act, so the community at large can be comfortable accessing ' ,c: >~:='s either at public.healthsetting /hospitals or at private dinics.Rrivate clinics are still smz,i~ in ~ ' they are mainly located in big cities such as Kuala Lumpur, Penang, and Johor Bahru. For other places in the country, psychiatric services are mainly available at public hospitals. The community at large needs to be very wary, as the Counse ors Act (similar to licensing acts for psychologists in western countries) does not strictly regulate psychologists in Malaysia. Although the Counselors Act, was approved by the Malaysian parliament in 1998, the implementation has been very slow. At this point, not all psychologists and counselors have registered under the Counselors Act. -C\"he Board of Counselors faces difficulties in regulating the activities of these non-registered psychologists and counselors, despite complaints from the community about suspect qualifications. The presence of bogus psychologists is a major concern. EAP professionals from other countries need to be alert about this problem in Malaysia, because. EAP professionals usually need close collaboration with local psychologists /counselors for initiation or implementation of EAPs at the local level. In general, the number of trained and credible clinical and counseling psychologists in Malaysia is still too small to serve the needs of the community at large. Most of the qualified professionals are associated with the public services (hospitals, universities, and colleges); others work at community non-profit organizations and very few operate private clinics/centers. In Malaysia, most Social Workers are associated with public services (Department of Social Welfare, and hospitals). Only a handful are with community non-profit organizations, and very few are established in private practice or in corporate settings. Psychiatric Nurses work mainly in public hospitals. INSURANCE POLICIES At this point,there is still no mental health insurance coverage available for the Malaysian worker.The Malaysian Psychiatric Association has been championing this cause for many years but could not get the local health insurance companies to 132 offer insurance coverage for mental health related problems. However, in the past year, the Malaysian Psychiatric Association seems be making progress; the Association managed to get the government division, which regulates all insurance companies, to see the importance of such coverage. STATUS OF EAPS Motorola was the first company that established a foothold for EAP development~in Malaysia when its global EAP was expanded to include Malaysia in February 1999. Motorola Malaysia is still the only multinational corporation that provides a comprehensive employee assistance program to all employees, Motorola's EAP also includes an internal mental health benefit plan, designed specifically because no mental health benefit plan (insurance coverage) was available in Malaysia. This type of benefit plan is essential to making EAPs successful, All employees, regardless of grades, are entitled to coverage of treatment when they are referred by the EAP to external psychiatrists or psychologists for further intervention. in comparison, some other big local, multinational or foreign corporations in Malaysia do reimburse the costs of psychiatric ~,~ ~sy~ ,oiv~ical treatment. However, that usually is only on`a case-to=case basis, and usually it is Dui ~n~~l ~y aes ire key positions but is not available for all employees. In developing countries like Malaysia, overcoming the stigma associated with mental health problems requires a creative approach in the delivery of EAP services. Otherwise, the program may fail due to a lack of support from the employees. Motorola's EAP is staffed locally so programs can be adapted and delivered with relevance to the local culture yet without compromising the core technology. Motorola's EAP staff provides strategic consultation, problem identification and solution management. Consultation is provided to facilitate improved productivity, enhanced retention, accelerated change integration and identification of situations that require professional intervention. Motorola's EAP its known globally for the Six Steps of Management Consultation Process, introduced in 1992 by Sheila Monaghan, Vice President of Motorola's Global Employee Consultation Systems at that time. As a tool, the Six Steps of Management Consultation have been repeated effectively at all Motorola sites that have full EAP implementation.This tool has been benchmarked, and is considered reliable with a predictable process to resolve workplace issues. Managers and employees at Motorola Malaysia have accepted the EAP concepts of management /supervisory referral very well when presented in the context of job performance issues. By focusing on job performance issues such as absenteeism or tardiness instead of emotional symptoms the approach has removed the stigma of mental heath problems and increased the importance of improving employees' productivity. Apart from managing individual situations, Motorola EAP also provides consultation and support for organizational situations. For example, when and organization undergoes major changes the EAP staff provides Transition Support (Transition Managementi).Transition Support is a consultative and educational process provided by the EAP to managers and key business partners who are involved in implementing an organizational change. EAP Consultants act in an 133 advisory capacity to educate, strategize and problem solve during all phases of the change plan impacting the human aspect of change. In addition, the EAP offers trainings and individual consultations to support affected managers and employees. Serious workplace impact can result from a critical incident such as the death or serious injury of a co-worker, a natural disaster, or situation that threatens life or safety. Crisis Support services are provided by the EAP to resolve issues in a timely manner, facilitate a return to maximum functioning, and promote well being for both the organization and its staff. The Motorola EAP is also known internally for its collaborative work with the Human Resources Department in resolving complicated workplace situations, using a system called the IMFERSDT^^ (Integrated Model for Employee Relations Service Delivery). Apart from Motorola, some leading multinational and local corporations in Malaysia provide some form of EAP sPrvicec. to their employees, but these differ from the scope of services of a typical EAP in industrialized countries. Typically, these programs may not even be called EAP. By late 2002 or early 2003, Dupont and Kimberley Clarke, two multinational corporations in Malaysia, had started asmall-scale EAP for their local employees. Local-based corporations with some assistance in place include a major telecommunication company called Telekom Malaysia.lt has an internal program that offers peer counseling to all employees.This is a big corporation with about 25,000 employees scattered throughout the thirteen states in Malaysia. Human Resources has initiated a program in which employees interested in peer counseling are sent for further counseling training, Upon returning, the employee will be appointed - as a peer counselor at his/her designated office/department. Other employees who need assistance can approach this appointed person:lnterestingly,they call themselves Employee Assistance Counselors. In the last few years, other medium and large established corporations in Malaysia have started to acknowledge the imporfiance of addressing mental health problems, On a periodical basis, they have invited mental health professionals to conduct stress management types of workshops or mental health related talks to their employees. As mentioned earlier, the willingness to reimburse the cost of psychiatric or psychological treatment (at least on a \"case to case basis\" and usually for employees of key positions) indicates an increased awareness of the impact on productivity of mental health issues. These issues include stress, marital/family problems, depression, and drug/alcohol addiction. Employers are beginning to realize that these issues, left untreated, may interfere with effective job performance, attendance, retention and overall quality of work. 134 RESOURCES AND EAP PROVIDERS Mi Yen, Low EAP Regional Manager, Asia Pacific Affiliated Computer Services Inc.** Level 16, Menara Luxor, Persiaran Tropicana department was outsourced to Affiliated Computer Services (ACS) on Feb. i, 2005 135 EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN MEXICO BY DEBORAH LOFFLER AND A. QUINTOS BACKGROUND Mexico is one of the countries in the so-called North America zone.The political name of the country is United States of Mexico, Its location allows Mexico to serve as a bridge to Central America, the Caribbean, and South America. Mexico shares a border with the United States of America (north frontier) and with Guatemala and Belize (south frontier). The Mexican territory measures 1,964,375 square kilometers. Mexican culture reflects the history of the country, and features people of many backgrounds including indigenous tribes, Spaniards, French, and Americans. These groups have offered their folklore and have helped shape modern Mexico. The history of Mexico spans many eras of difficulty, Some of the challenges the 1810 War of Independence from Spain the Mexican Revolution in 1910, and several social fights over more equitable distribution of wealth among the Mexican people. Today approximately 103 million people form the Mexican population. Rural areas are dominated by people whose ancestors were part of pre-Hispanic groups such as the Mayas, Aztecs, or Toltec, as well as countrymen who labored in agriculture. 73~io or` fviexico's people five in the city.Tnese people nave peen influenced by turopeans\u2014 mostly Spanish anti French\u2014 and by North American culture. The most important cities are Guadalajara, Monterrey, and the capital of the country, Mexico City. 93% of the Mexican population is Catholic.The official language is Spanish, spoken in almost all of the territory, although there are more than 54 languages and dialects such as the Nahuatl, Otomi, Mixtec, Zapotec and Tononac. STATUS OF SAPS The Mexican culture still attaches a.stigma to mental illness, emotional problems, and related issues, It is not common or accepted for Mexican people to talk openly about going to counseling, getting therapy, or taking medication for problems such as depression or anxiety. If someone shares this type of information with family members or co-workers, the first reaction is typically either\"this person must be crazy,\"or\"this person is weak and cannot handle problems. \"For most ofthe population, if a need arises to discuss emotional problems the top choices are the priest and the physician. Like other countries of Latin America, Mexico has a limited mental health system and a poor prevenfiion health culture. Mexico is a poor nation with no preventive medicine programs other than childhood vaccinations, women's pap smears, and some newly emerging dental programs. 136 Almost all, if not all, countries in Latin America have public health systems as well as private health insurance, but neither of them covers mental health problems. Even in the few public mental health institutes, professionals are not well trained or specialized to provide adequate treatment for people who can not afford to pay for private treatment. In contrast to the United States and other first world countries, Mexico does nofi have swell-structured mental .health system to address emotional problems. in the current Latin American business environment there is a lack of awareness of the direct correlation between the physical /emotional well being of the employees and positive results for the company. Current medical programs focus mostly on occupational exposure.This gap underlines the importance of an EAP in a society where the emotional needs of employees are not fulfilled. Executives in Latin America are starting to grasp the importance of an EAP, but they tend to lack understanding of why they should pay to provide their employees with an EAP. Upper management executives don't recognize mental health issues, and they also face a lack of mental health programs available for companies other than stress management talks coupled with workshops. Management officials are concerned that EAPs could interfere with the private lives of employees, and also worry that the employees will feel the company is intrusive and will find out about their personal problems. Worse, management generally does not see the wide range of emotional problems that employees are, or will be, facing. Every day many employees come to work with problems that are affecting performance, safety, and productivity. Only employers who already have an EAP are starting to understand, little by little, the real magnitude and impact of emotional problems in the work area. When money is invested in health and well-being programs for employees, this does not stem from a culture of organizational health, but instead serves as a response to law, to internal company regulations, and to union pressures. In Mexico few companies realize that health and well being programs have a significant impact on organizations, and companies generally do not try to determine the return on investment; companies do not know that this approach exists in this field. ASISTENCIA EMPRESARIAL MEXICANA (AEM) AEM is part of Monte Fenix Group, which was founded in 1979 as a Rehabilitation Center. At first they treated only alcoholism; afterwards, through experience in this field, Monte Fenix decided to broaden their objective. Since 1986, they have offered treatment for addiction to other drugs, because of social needs that demanded such treatment. In 1996, DuPont Mexico approached Monte Fenix Group to help develop an employee assistance program, not only to handle addiction problems of DuPont employees but also to provide all the services of an EAP. Monte Fenix Group trusted DuPont and agreed to develop one of the the first EAPs in Mexico. 137 That same year, the President of Monte Fenix Group, Jorge Larrea, traveled to la Jolla, California to form a strategic alliance with Scripps Health in California, In collaboration with Steven Gae, who developed the EAP for the FBI and DEA, he worked on the implementation of this program in Mexico. Against a backdrop of the history of EAPs around the world and the awareness of emotional problems affecting productivity in Mexico and other parts of Latin America, Asistencia Empresarial Mexicana (AEM) was created in August 1996 to provide the employee assistance program. The process of adapting the program to the Mexican culture lasted around one year. This work was possible thanks to a multidisciplinary group concerned about transferring recognized standards (EAPA) to the Mexican market, The employee assistance program of AEM provides a range of services. These include: emotional. ~~apport and crisis intervention by phone, face to face sessions with short-term focus on the resolution of problems, supervisor /management consultations, referrals, access to a data bank with a network of specialized professionals, critical incident debriefings (CID), educational /formative talks to employees, and orientation talks and supervisor trainings. Promotional material is created for AEM's clients. For example, clients benefit from quarterly brochures, monthly electronic messages, a website and posters. AEM's Call Center provides services 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, The staff has the experience and training for crisis intervention and emotional support by phone. These mental health professionals provide a close follow up of cases through a database created internally by AEM and based on international EAP reports and registration requirements.This computer -based program ensures that clients and employees receive accurate and timely support. The program also develops reports of utilization that are sent to AEM clients and are strictly statistical and confidential. AEM has a counselor network of more than 80 professionals in mental health and Organizational Psychology in all the countries where it operates.All of these counselors are highly qualified in using a short-term approach to provide the best service to AEM clients. Clients complete satisfaction evaluations on all AEM services and counselors an a regular basis.AEM places a high priority on confidentiality and follows EAPA's code of ethics and guidelines,The client account managers have a close relationship with the Human Resource and/or Medical staff. Monthly,semester,and annua)statistical reports are provided to the AEM client contact (HR leader or doctor).These reports provide an overview of the program percentage of usage, trends or patterns that may highlight work areas which may need prevention talks, actions, workshops or intervention as well as trainings that provide adequate solutions and/or alternatives. The goal of AEM is to match the quality found in programs in the United States. This requires a continuous 138 improvement process over the years. It is thought that this has allowed AEM to start working with International EAP companies to provide full EAP services, or individual EAP services in Mexico and other countries in Latin America. ASISTENCIA EMPRESARIAL MEXICANA PATHFORWARD A great waste of human resources. has occurred as companies have implemented reengineering, total quality and excellence processes, High costs sometimes are visible, while others are hidden and difficult to detect.These include: high personnel rotation, absenteeism, accidents at work, and decision -making mistakes.These difficulties stem from the daily emotional problems of employees and have a large impact on the work environment.

Heck mentions in his article,\"The Impact of Mental Health Problems in the Environment of Work: Employer Issues and Responses,\" DuPont's EAP experience shows that employers can, indeed, proactively address mental ill health. Heck demonstrates that safety and productiuity:are anhanced:when attention. ~.. ~~:.. ~~ .~ {r!~~.f ;`.! ',^cell being of employees and their families.

THE IMPACT OF MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF WORK EMPLOYER ISSUES AND RESPONSES, Manager -Global Employee Assistance Services, DuPont 140 EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN THE NETHERLANDS BY IGOR MOLL BACKGROUND The Netherlands is globally known as a small country with a high economic standard of living and a good infrastructure. The Dutch maintain a tradition of social responsibility, which has been historically fed by the strong Protestant conviction of one population segment and a more labor-oriented other segment. Before World War two, \"Workplace Health Promotion \"was taken care of in existing communities of the church or organized laborers; after the war, the government of the Netherlands established a more formal program. This overview focuses on the current status of the Netherlands health care system, its related professions, the relation with organizational heath questions, and the experience and opportunities for concepts like EAP. 7.;, r~,..~__._ . THE NETHERLANDS HEALTHCARE SYSTEM At the moment of writing,The Netherlands is facing major changes in its health care system. In the Netherlands, every cit- izen has (in theory) access to fairly good health care services.The services have always been dominated and controlled by the government. However, in the last few years, because of increasing problems within the system itself and the system's failure to satisfy the needs of its customers, more and more private clinics and private initiatives have been established. To understand this, it is necessary to know something about the buildup of the system: First you see a division in clients based on income. Low-earning or non-earning citizens have government -sponsored health care. They are part of agovernment- supported fund, or insurance (called \"ziekenfonds\" or \"sick-fund\"). From their earned income a very small part is contributed to this fund,and in return they can use different services while the fund pdys directly for the invoices. In some cases these citizens have to pay an extra fee for a specific service, or the use of the service is limited to a specific amount or times used (e.g., the fund only pays for five sessions of physiotherapy). High-earning citizens have a private health care insurance, The insurance company offers different packages from which these citizens can choose. Depending on the coverage chosen, payment of services can be claimed by the private insurance company; Second, you see a very distinctive\u2014 almos[ rigid\u2014division in the way services are provided. Almost every citizen is (based on region) assigned to ahouse- doctor and a dentist.These are general- educated doctors who are treating families and individuals within a specific community.The doctor acts as an entry portfor all other health. care.if specialists are needed or if a hospital visit is needed, the doctor/dentist makes a referral. Alongside these doctors, one sees specific organizational doctors.These are sometimes part of a so-called commercial \"ARBO- dienst\"(Occupational Health Services Organization (ARBO- service)) and sometimes they are part of and employed by a specific company (internally driven ARBD-service). These ARBO-services are designed to provide and monitor integrated safety and health in the work place. Especially 141 when this is an internal service, employees of these companies have in some cases more easy access to these doctors than their house-doctor, whereas their family members are using the house-doctor. In the case of problems related to mental health, there are government -sponsored counselling bureaus (RIAGG \u2014First Une) to which the house- or organizatiorial- doctors refer. There also are commercial counselors who have their own practice and work for private paying clients or insured clients for whom the insurance company wants to pay. A very new development is that by 2005 organizations are no longer forced to stick to an ARBO-service, but are free to buy all these services in modules by whatever party they are interested in or provide them themselves. lt's still not clear what impact this will have on the market, but many believe that the large commercial ARBO-services will lose market share to more advanced smaller specialists and to internal ARBO-services.This might also give a boost to EAP-related services. Third, you see a very well developed social securitysyscem. It is becoming increasingly more expensive because (1) that the average age of the inhabitants is rising (thus increasing medical care and state-provided pensions) and (2) there is an increase in mental health problems therefore agrowing percentage of otherwise employable people can not work any longer and make claims on social security funds (which are very good in The Netherlands). Some citizens of The Netherlands have a private income-insurance, in which case the insurance company pays part of the salary in case of job loss. These characteristics exist next to each other and in many cases are totally interlaced.. It can therefore happen that a well-earning family member has his/her own private insurance, while his/her partner is low-earning and therefore makes use of the \"sick-fund': If the well-earning partner also works in a large plant with its own internal ARBO-service, he can (for some services) use the organizational- doctor and nothing is charged at all. In case one of the partners has his/her own income-insurance, he or she gets continuing income from the insurance company (and partially from the government) when suffering from a depression, burn-out, or other job-loss-creating circumstances. IMPACT ON ORGANIZATIONAL HEALTH Due to the increase in the use of medical care and the pressure on social security, in daily practice there are long waiting lists for more specialized services. In some regions, new inhabitants even find it hard to get a regular house-doctor. Because of that, and in an effort to decrease costs, the government is busy restructuring the health care system. The government is trying to involve the private sector more and more in this field. Thus, there has been an increase in the number of privately owned clinics providing specific medical care, and insurance companies are taking the lead together with the larger companies. 142 Insurance companies more and more are becoming full-service organizations that not only provide insurance for care, but also buy care organizations and provide care themselves. This involves the \"sale and buy\" of the larger commercial \"ARBO-services,\" which, in turn, serve these organizations as customers. organizations with an internally driven ARBO- serviceare also becoming more and more aware of the costs in connection with employees who are sick or can not return to work at all due to awork- related illness. The aforementioned development in forced Organization -ARBO- service relations is also shaping the ground for future organizational Health Care. in addition, new government legislation imposes huge, penalties on companies if employees are sent into the social security system, More and more companies try to insure themselves indifferent ways, keeping their employees at work as long as possible in a humane and healthy way. The transforming insurance companies together with the existing ARBO- services are increasingly focused on prevention of work-related sickness, and are willing to invest in this. This movement makes the shift from Government -Supported Care towards .Institutional- 5.upported Care in which a few large institutions (insurance companies and independent ARBO-services) provide1carp~ for individuals who\u2014in one way or another\u2014 paysome fee for this. PROFESSIONS In general, one can make a division between \"classified\" social workers (SW) and \"classified\" psychotherapists (PT). In principal the SW is the first person with whom troubled employees have contaet.The task of the SW is to support in a more pragmatic way the social environment of the client. This means making house visits and acting as a pivot between the client and social support organizations which the client is entitled to use. A lot of SWs, however, have the experience to also engage in a counselling relation with the client. Once the nature of this counselling becomes more complex, a PT takes over the contact with the client and proceeds with ashort ormid-term psychotherapeutical treatment. Although in some cases an SW and PT have overlapping fields of interest, in practice they work in a constructive way adding value to each other's existence; the SW executes tasks the PT does not want to do, and vice versa. For the SW, special education programs are available (academic /bachelors level).There is, however, no formal government registration, so anyone with similar experience /education and the right social skills can execute this role. SW's have their own professional bodies. Becoming a PT s different. Although some years ago anybody could call himself a psychotherapist, those days are now over. In principal, a psychotherapist is a graduated clinical psychologist with four years post-masters education. These well-educated professionals have can become accredited (registered) therapists or\"health-care psychologists':In addition, there are also people with different psychological /social backgrounds who have mastered a shorter and more specific therapeutical study (e,g. cognitive behavior therapy) and treat only in this area. They are not registered, but work in the same areas as registered PT's.The interests of the PT's are taken care of by different professional bodies (each form of treatment 143 has its own body; the Netherlands Institute of Psychologists (NIP) is the largest. Contrary to the formal (government- driven) registration of PT's, the NIP has its own ways of licensing psychologists. In daily practice, we therefore see a mix of more and less experienced, registered and not-registered PT's working next to each other.A membership in the NIP and/or a government registration is considered a sign of quality. STATUS OF EAPS What does this all mean for the status of EAP in the Netherlands? EAP is not awell-known concept in the Netherlands. Due to its healthcare system and history in segmented responsibility over different professional groups, mental health care has mostly been a case for the private environment. However, from the late 1980s on, some changes have occurred.The following historical fly-over can be were started and counselling services (psychotherapy) were first delivered to organizations by psychological consulting firms.The importance of clinical psychological values for organizations gains ground (\"organizational therapy \"). Mid-end 1990's. Increasing focus on mental well being for employees due to. Differentiation in counselling provision (price-fighting); ICAS established in the Netherlands: major contract with income-insurance company. End 1990's-early 2000's. Insurance companies are taking over care for the mentally disabled employee: Income-insurance as well as Health-insurance companies; Strong focus from government on reducing social security payments (for physical and mentally disabled employees) Transference of this focus towards organizations by active reduction of absenteeism and risks involved If we relate these developments to a basic overview in EAP-services (see table 1) we can state that within The Netherlands mixed forms of EAP or EAP-like services exist. The name EAP, however, is not well known.The mixing of the characteristics from Table 1 led to basically three forms of EAP for the Netherlands market: 1. \"Full-blown\"EAP. In-company; Fee Per Headcount; Broad-brush. -professional -client; 144 Reintegration additional services. 3, \"Economy \"EAP. Narrow-brush; Paid per contact; Additional services on request. The Netherlands market is more familiar with the last two types of EAP.They are often referred to as\"reintegration- services\" (or just \"counselling services for employees \").This type of service is designed to rehabilitate employees who have been absent due to mental issues for a considerably long time. _._. .. Table 1: Differentiation EAP Services \u00b0' EAP DEVELOPMENTS IN THE NETHERLANDS Due to tradition the term EAP is not typically used in The Netherlands.Thus,talking about EAP creates ambiguity; although the characteristic services of EAP are executed within the marketplace, mentioning EAP as such raises question marks. Because of the different (political and economicaD changes expected in the next years, the prospects for EAP or EAP-like services are strong. From 2005 on, organizations are no longer obliged to \"buy-in\"different organizational health related services via the one restricted channel the commercial ARBO-services organizations.There slso is a growing (cost related) conviction among managers regarding the importance of mental well being for employees; that leads to a growing demand for integrated services in this area. More and more. organizations wild therefore be searching -for (integrated) solutions that fit their Organization best. EAP, as such or in other words, can provide this integrated solution very well.The success of existing or new EAP providers will depend on the way they can give publicity to this integrated approach and the term EAP in itself. EAP OR EAP-LIKE PROVIDERS IN THE NETHERLANDS General comment: As stated above, the term EAP is not very well known in the Netherlands. It is therefore particularly difFicult to mention any EAP (like) providers in the Netherlands. Some companies are using the term EAP, but the content of the programs is not often clear.The distinction is therefore based on the following \"YES\"or\"NO\"; in the market: how long the specific company has offered services in this area to the market. ~~~ RESOURCES Igor Moll Phyleon, Center for Leadership &Change Jan van Nassaustraat 16 2596 BT Den Haag Tel.: +31 70 324 87 11 /mobile: +31 6 512 Fax: 03 e-mail: igormoll @phyleon.nl or imoll@planet,nl 146 EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN NEW ZEALAND BY MATTHEW BEATTIE BACKGROUND New Zealand is located in the southern Pacific Ocean, approximately 1,600 kilometers southeast of Australia. New Zealand is comprised of two main islands,the North and South Islands. it is similar in size to Colorado and somewhere between the size of Japan and the United Kingdom,The first documented European to discover New Zealand was Dutch navigator Abel Tasman who came herein 1642 in search of the fabled great southern continent.Over 125 years later, in 1769,James Cook claimed it for Britain and produced a map of the country. The Treaty. of Waitangi, seen as New Zealand's founding document, established the country as a nation. It was signed in 1840 by leading Maori chiefs and represe;~t.AFt + , :-` z~~_ .,; ~ :.:;cs~v,i at Waitangi, in the Bay of Islands, now one of the country's most historic sites. New Zealand became fully independent in 1947 and has a government structure based on the British parliamentary system with only tenuous ties to Britain through New Zealand's membership of the British Commonwealth. New Zealand is an independent nation with a diverse multicultural population of 4 million people, the majority of whom are of British descent. New Zealand's indigenous Maori make up around 13 percent of the population; however, New Zealand is becoming a country of increasing ethnic diversity. Immigration from Asia has doubled in the past 10 years with one in fifteen people being Asian. There is also a steady inflow of people from the Pacific Islands and today Pacific people comprise around 6 percent of the total population. STATUS OF SAPS Employee Assistance Programmes (EAPs) in New Zealand are divided into two categories: internal and external.They are entirely company- or organizationally -sponsored. Members programmes have never been an option.There are currently four major external providers, and a number of internal programmes, some of which have been operating for the past thirty years. EAPs were first introduced into New Zealand in the 1970s by the State Services Commission, a government department, in conjunction with the Alcohol Liquor Advisory Council (ALAC).The primary focus of these early EAPs was to address the .issue of the use of alcohol in the workplace with the intention of minimizing the personal, social and economic costs of the misuse of alcohol. In 1990,the Government undertook a review of ALAC and recommended the establishment of a separate EAP provider with less focus on alcohol and drug issues and more on general health and well being, This resulted in the development of the first organization in New Zealand to deal solely with EAP work. Subsequently, EAPs began to develop to meet local conditions and became more like the\"broad brush\" programmes that had already been implemented in the US but without the inclusion of the core technology components.This led to programmes focussing mainly on employee wellness and behavioral healthcare issues. 147 EAPs today provide services for individual employees, their families, company management and the company as a whole. The individual assessment counselling and referral services are no longer limited to alcohol end drug problems.They now include marital issues, family and relationship issues, emotional stress, work related problems, financial worries, gambling or other addictions, grief, trauma, and serious illnesses such as cancer and AIDS. EAP professionals train senior and middle management supervisors and company personnel on using the EAP and promoting its use throughout an organization. The EAP provides programmes as required by the organization to enhance the health, well being and personal development of employees as preventive measures.An example of the comprehensive list of services provided by external EAPs includes workplace mediation and conflict resolution, training and development, trauma management, employee counselling, stress management programmes, alcohol and other drugs in the workplace consulting, change management, career transition services, and coaching for managers and supervisors. External EAPs also help set policies and procedures relating to employee assistance and health and safety issues. This has become increasingly important with recent legislative changes to the Health and Safety Act.The changes have put the. onus on the employer to ensure a safe working environment and place an emphasis on the effective mariagement of stress and fatigue in the workplace. Emotional and psychological hazards in the workplace are now equal to physical hazards such as wet floors, unsecured ladders and exposed wiring. EAPs provide a variety of workplace social support services to New Zealand employees and are growing as the benefits to employers, unions and government agencies are recognized.Approximately 47% of New Zealand companies have an EAP, compared with 34% in 1995. EAPs continue to develop and expand their services to meet the current needs of the workplace, with concerns including bullying, violence, and women's issues.They are rapidly becoming an integral part of the overall delivery of health support services. However, it is felt that with New Zealand businesses dominated by small/medium enterprises,the eost benefit argument for companies with fewer than 50 employees is not canvincing.That is likely to thwart further extensive growth of EAPs unless consortium models are introduced. Some forward -thinking organizations have recently expanded their support services by introducing professional supervision for employees who are working in front line service delivery resulting in another subtle change in the way employee assistance is offered to assist organizafiions enhance performance management systems. Professional supervision uses a coaching and mentoring approach delivered from a safe practice supervision perspective.The ideal provider is a clinical supervisor with management, life skills and workplace experience.lt is likely that the current focus by government and a wide range of organizations on improving the quality of life for the workforce will result in increased awareness of the benefit of implementing EAPs in New Zealand. EAP P~aovi~ERs This section profiles the four main external EAP providers in New Zealand. INSTEP LIMITED Instep is a national employee assistance programme (EAP), critical incident support and behavioral healthcare provider 148 with coverage for over 180,000 employees based in New Zealand and overseas.

Its golden age occurred in the 16th century. During the following century, the strengthening of the gentry and internal disorders weakened the nation. In a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795,Russia,Prussia, and Austria partitioned Poland amangstthemselves.Poland regained its independence in 191.8 only to be overrun by Germany and the Soviet Union in Worid War II. Poland became a Soviet satellite state following the war, but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive. Labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union \"Solidarity\" that, over time, became a political force and by 1990 had swept parliamentary elections and the presidency. A\"shock th?rapu \u00b0nc~nram during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in Central Europe, but Poland currently suffers low GDP growth and high unemployment. Poland joined NATO in 1999 and accessed to the European Union along with nine other states on May 1, 2004. POPULATION OF POLAND 38,626,300 AREA 312,683 sq km ECQNOMIC OVERVIEWt: Poland has steadfasfily pursued a policy of economic liberalization throughout the 1990s and today stands out as a success story among transition economies. Even so, much remains to be done.The privatization of small and medium state-owned companies and a liberal law on establishing new firms has encouraged the development of the private business sector, but legal and bureaucratic obstacles alongside persistent corruption are hampering its further development. Poland's .agricultural sector remains handicapped by structural problems, surplus labor, inefficient small farms, and lack of investment. Restructuring and privatization of \"sensitive sectors\" (e.g., coal, steel, railroads, and energy), while recently initiated, have stalled. Reforms in health care, education, the pension system, and state administration have resulted in larger than expected fiscal pressures. Further progress in public finance depends mainly on privafiization of Poland's remaining state sector,the reduction of state employment, and an overhaul of the tax code to incorporate the growing gray economy and farmers, most of whom pay no tax. The government's determination to enter the EU has shaped most aspects of its economic policy and new legislation; in a nationwide referendum in November 2003, 77% of the voters voted in favor of Poland's EU accession. Improving Poland's export competitiveness and containing the internal budget deficit are top priorities. 153 SraTUS of EAPs In 1992, Stefan Batory Foundation organized an international symposium on \"Alcohol Problems at the Workplace': That event provided a fruitful discussion with many renowned American and West European specialists and, consequently, launched a nationwide campaign to raise awareness and disseminate education addressed to the work organizations in Poland, International Labor Organization included Poland in the international workplace prevention project in 1994-97. Several industrial enterprises have been selected to carry out the training program for managers and supervisors.The program is focused on the reduction of harm resulting from alcohol/drug use by the employees. While the pilot project has resulted in a successful implementation of the program in most selected companies, the idea of such programs has, not, found much' ~~r~i^cation-ire ~*Y rr`~\u00bb~~~;;aces.The main obstacles are related to the economic transition and poor understanding among the top executives on the real cost ofalcohol- related harm.The foreign partners who have come to work in Poland in the new joint ventures have ignored the benefits of a preventive approach,as they have usually considered the troubled employees easy to replace by the growing numbers of unemployed. Unfortunately, this unenlightened thinking has prevailed among business organizations and management circles to this day. The closing of the ILO project in Poland in 1997 was marked by the founding of the Polish ARMADA \u2014Association of Managers for the Healthy Workplace. The main purpose of the organization has been the promotion of the idea of alcohol/drugs prevention and the attraction of new companies to Join the movement. Training of workplace counseling professionals has been an important activity of ARMADA. LEADERS AND PROMOTERS Regardless of the unfavorable climate, the pioneers of the \"healthy workplace\" movement have undertaken many initiatives to disseminate the concept of mental health assistance to employees. Not only the NGO's (Batory Foundation, ARMADA) but also the government agency PARPA have participated in the activities. The Institute of Work Hygiene, the Labor Inspector's Office, and the National Institute of Management have become involved in promotion and training on the basic philosophy of alcohol problems prevention in the workplace. Publications, interviews, and TV and radio programs devoted to the subject have resulted from the campaign. An international EAP consulting company (Corporate Caring Systems, Brussels- Luxembourg) has come to Poland offering to establish mental health assistance programs in Polish-Western joint enterprises (including the Levi's in Plock). 154 POLAND'S HEALTHY WORKPLACE The crusaders and promoters of Employee Assistance Programs in Poland have actually succeeded without establishing a solid network of services. Especially in the area of alcohol related problems, employees are often offered a chance to go to treatment and then return to the workplace. Many managers and supervisors have understood the concept of early intervention for employees dearly experiencing problems with alcohol abuse. At least 25% of patients in addiction treatment facilities in Poland begin rehabilitation at the encouragement of workplace supervisors, Even those who come to treatment on their own, and will re-enter the work market afterwards, may expect acceptance of their having gone through addiction treatment. The unfavorable attitude toward recovering alcoholics has largely disappeared in the workplace in Poland. Business organizations seem to be unwilling to spend the money on setting up regular EAP services for employees.The managers became skilled enough to rrz~ti~;%ate-the rrn~.+hl.^~! ~rnpioyees to seek professional help, but challenges remain. Alcohol -related problems are handled with relative ease, but other mental health problems maybe much more difficult to recognize and more difficult to refer for specialized assistance. Further efforts should be undertaken to promote the healthy workplace along with dissemination of the EAP or mental health preventive programs in workplaces in Poland. In view of Poland's accession to the European Community, this task may be supported from Brussels by sound workplace policies and institutional encouragement related to early recognition of employees' problems due to mental health problems \u2014with a special focus en irresponsible alcohol use. Occupational Social Work services do not operate in the Polish labor system. Employees make use of the National Health Care system, which provides health services including inpatient and outpatient alcohol -related treatment programs. Poland seems to be a future market for EAPs and similar initiatives. RESOURCES AND EAP PROVIDERS Stefan Batory PROGRAMS IN PORTUGAL BY SANDRA GONAWES MONTEIRO BACKGROUND The implementation of EAP in Portuguese companies faces three major challenges.The first is the recognition that employees have personal problems that affect the organizational Iife.The second is the recognition that the organization has a role to play in this matter. The third and the hardest one to overcome is a recognition of the\"need\"to invest in a service that can help employees to solve their personal problems. To provide a clear view of the EAP phenomenon in Portugal, it is essential to explain some issues that directly affect the implementation of the Employee Assistance Program in Portuguese companies.Thereare essentially two main items that are very important in this mattei : e proi~ie of Portuguese companies, and the profile and trends of the Portuguese families. Small and medium companies represent 99% of all Portuguese industry. They employ 3 of 4 employees in the private sector, and represent 7 of 10 Euros produced in the country. If we include in the group of small and middle size enterprises the micro companies, then the mean of employees in Portuguese companies stands at 22. If we analyze big companies, the mean of employees stands at 1,034. In 2003, the 2000 biggest Portuguese companies lost 7,731 million working days to sickness and 7,731 to working accidents.This represents a 5.5%damage during 2003. Data from European Foundation for better conditions in life and work (1997) revealed that Portugal has an absenteeism rate of 8~/0. As a consequence, the Portuguese government encouraged middle-sized and small companies to reduce the sickness and the absenteeism rate,These kinds of companies are particularly sensitive to long-term absenteeism. The middle-sized and small companies have poor resources and usually do not have specialized knowledge. All European countries have difficulties implementing health policies in small and middle-sized companies. The Portuguese family profile is also peculiar. The average family has 3 members.This represents the biggest size of the European Union. (See table 1 on following page.) 156 TABLE 1 2001 1991 ~aa~ ~ 1981 1971Evolution of Family Size In recent years,we could i~ientity.a change:in fa!r~ly-profile (Portuguese National Institute of Statistics,2003), Although the decrease of numbered families single parent families have increased. Most single person families represent an older person; 33% of Portuguese families have older people. (See table 2.)

TABLE 4 Number of days at home taking care of the family 199 2000 2001 2002 2003 Men time spent with familytasks,we identify clear and significant differences between men and women.Women stay at home caring for the family many more days than men do.The involvement of women in family has been an obstacle to equal opportunities for men and women in Portuguese companies. Sharing tasks at home is also an issue, because women spend more time on that than men da Analyzing in detail families with children, we easily verify that women spend more hours with them than men do. These tasks include taking physical care of children, driving them to school, taking them to sports, playing with them, going to the cinema with them, and taking them to the doctor. Of ail tasks involving children, the one to which men devote the most time is physical care. In 2001, almost alb families have a member employed; the families with no one employed are families with elderly people. 158 During recent years, family structure has experienced some changes related to marriage, divorce, and childbearing issues. The wedding rate reduced from 7,2 in 1991 to 5.4 in 2002. At the same time the divorce rate increased from 1,1 per thousand habitants to 2.7. Since women have the first child later, and the number of children per woman has decreased, the Portuguese population is getting older. STATUS OF EAPS The EAP industry has attracted an emerging interest from companies. Some companies already have a draft of the Employee Assistance Program. Generally, employee assistance exists in multinational companies or in big Portuguese companies. In general, the enterprises with social services have a department in the main office for managers and for employees with behavior needs, and have a very well developed net of professionals and health companies.The professionals that work in these social service departments are social workers or psychologists.Their tyorkinvolves receiving employees, identifying the scope of the problem, and leading the employees to professionals in their network. These companies make health insurance available to their employees as part of the National Health Service. But in general this health insurance does not include support for. alcohol and drug problems, psychiatric problems, AIDS, injuries from physical violence, or injuries from attempted suicide. For example if we analyze only the data related to the number of suicides in the last few years, the increase in these numbers is very significant. (See table 5.) TABLE 5 10b0 900 ~ 800 :a 700 ~ 600 ~ 500 ~ 400 300 200 ~ 100 0 Year\u2014~-- Men \u2014+~\u2014Women This data reveals that advanced companies still have a lot of work to do in the EAP field. 159 At this moment, some companies are changing this tendency; they are negotiating, drawing and implementing EAP models with outsourcing partners, In this field, companies have been searching for programs dealing with Workplace Critical Incidents, Workplace without Drugs, Workplace without Stress, and Employee Assistance Programs. It's clear that some industries are more sensitive to these issues then others.Organizations with more interest in the EAP field typically are in the information and communication Cechnology industry, pharmaceutical industry, transports industry or production industry.They all have clear and strong differences in their needs. Evaluating the EAP status in the small and medium traditional Portuguese companies shows that this service is almost unknown. However, some managers of small and medium companies are familiar already with Employee Assistance Programs. in these cases,we have essentially three main positions. Some managers recognize the advantage of the EAP but they do not have the financial or human resources to implement it. Others feel that since they are a small or medium company (iri whicho everyone knows everyone) they can solve the personal problems of employees through proximity, informality and friendship. Finally, some managers do not feel responsibility for or involvement in employee personal problems. CURRENT ISSUES AND TRENDS OF EAP IN PORTUGAL The structure and dimension of Portuguese companies determine the fundamental issues and trends of EAP in Portugal. First, enterprises that naturally will adhere to the EAP in Portugal are the multinational companies because they already have experience with the advantages of these programs.The second group with the conditions and resources to adhere is composed of the big Portuguese companies, because they have already implemented internal programs and services very similar to the EAP. Finally, the group of small and medium Portuguese companies will probably be the last to implement Employee Assistance Programs. In this group, factories are more sensitive to health problems, probably because they have employees with fewer economic and social resources. In these companies we can observe high levels of absenteeism, work accidents, addiction to alcohol, and violence. Usually, the occupational doctor dons not have awell-developed net for referring employees with behavior problems. The EAP in Portugal has essentially three trends: The development of the EAP consortium model. The perfect coordination between social services already implemented and EAP model. The development of Workplace Critical Incidents adjusted to the reality of each industry. 160 WORKPLACE\u2014 SOCIAL WORK IN PORTUGUESE COMPANIES In Portuguese. companies, it is already accepted that addiction to alcohol, drugs and tobacco reduces the productivity, the well-being and the health of employees. To address these kinds of problems, companies include in their plan of security and health protocols to proceed in these situations,Occupational health professionals sometimes directly intervene. To encourage health policies, some companies are developing actions about stress, alcohol, drugs, violence or general health. Generally, companies with social workers in the workplace do not serve families of employees. With that approach, it's clear these companies have not made adjustments to the evolution in Portuguese families. Each day more and more Portuguese companies have employees who live alone with their children, and many families have elderly people with a high probability of chronic disease and a need for additional support. Although women have careers, they stiilhave a strong ir.~iolvement with children and home tasks. Workplace social work clearly doesn't answer employee needs because this area isn't yet a priority in major Portuguese companies. Personal problems of the employees are not clearly recognized as affecting the organizational life, and globally organizations don't feel they have a role and responsibility in this matter so the investment in social service is viewed as luxury. The absence of knowledge, experience, tradition in social work policies, and Portuguese case studies are clearly obstacles to implementing Employee Assistance Programs.

Taguspark 20 2780 www.outcome.com.pt email: info.geral @outcome.com.pt ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN PUERTO RICO BY LUCY L6PEZ -ROIG AND MARION A. WENNERHOLM BACKGROUND Puerto Rico is an island 100 miles long and 35 miles wide, located between the Caribbean Sea and the. North Atlantic Ocean. Roughly the size of the state of Connecticut, it is the easternmost and smallest of a chain of islands called the Greater Antilles. It lies east of the Dominican Republic and west of the Virgin Islands and is approximately 1,000 miles southeast of Miami, Florida,The population of Puerto Rico is close to four million people'.The island's population density of 1,100 people per square mile is among the highest in the world. Originally populated by indigenous Tainos, Puerto Rico was a Spanish colony for four centuries. It was discovered by _.: C=uric{ s-;;::, ~,~;;~~u. n, '; ~4~~3. In the early 1500's it was explored, conquered, end governed by Juan Ponce de Leon., \"*~:. a brief period of autonomy in the 1890's, Puerto Rico became a territory of the United States after the Spanish American War of 1898, fn 1917, the Jones Act granted Puerto Ricans United States citizenship. The first governor elected by the Puerto Ricans themselves was Luis Munoz Marfp (1948). Puerto Rico has been a United States Commonwealth since July 25,1952. It adopted its own Constitution and established a democratic and republican form of government, divided into three branches; the legislative, executive and judicial.The Governor is elected every four years with vast voter participation. A Resident Commissioner, who serves as the island's delegate to the U.S. Congress, holds limited powers as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. During the 1950's and 1960's, the island experienced a period of dramatic economic development as it promoted and attracted manufacturing plants primarily from the U.S. mainland. Puerto Rico gradually changed from an agricultural to an industrial society and by 1970 the island was mostly urban for the first time in its history. The passionate debate over Puerto Rico's political status has dominated the political arena for decades.Three political parties correspond to different status options; the Popular Democratic Party (pro-Commonwealth), the New Progressive Party (pro-Statehood), and the Puerto Rico Independence Party. Status plebiscites during the 1990's showed that the vast ma)ority of Puerto Ricans favor either remaining a commonwealth or becoming a state. The much smaller (4%) Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP) favors an independent republic. The island's cultural and ethnic heritage reflects the influence of Spanish, African, Ta(no Indian and North American backgrounds, as well as that of immigrants from other islands in the Caribbean and Central America. Spanish is the primary language in Puerto Rico. English is taught in the schools as a second language. i The major industries in terms of employment are manufacturing, services, retail trade and government. The average per capita income in Puerto Rico is far below the average in the United States. As a commonwealth of the United States, Puerto Rico is subJect to federal laws relevant to Employee Assistance programs such as the Americans with Disabilities Act,the Drug-Free Workplace Act, the Equal Employment Opportunity Act,and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). STATUS OF EAPS During the 1970's, Puerto Rico's first EAPs were embedded in local public corporations and a few multi-national corporations in the manufacturing industry. These programs offered support systems staffed by psychologists and social workers to assist employees. In the 1980's, the U.S. federal government began to contract external providers to provide EAP services to its employees at federal agencies in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin islands. During the late 1980's, organizations in the nrivate.se~tor hewn tc~-adopt EAPs, In some cases they were following mandates .from corporate headquarters in,th~.,~,!S. ; ,,;;; However,the leaders of local companies became convinced of the benefits of the program even though they knew little about what EAPs were doing elsewhere.The idea made sense to them, since they knew all too well that their employees' unresolved personal problems were affecting job performance. The steady growth of EAPs in Puerto Rico continued through the 1990's.' EAPs have now become so widespread that employees who change jobs ask their new employers if the EAP is included in the benefits package. Other significant events have contributed to the evolution'of EAP services. For many years, the government of Puerto Rico was a direct provider of healthcare services, including mental health. Since health reform in the late 1990's, the government's role has changed to that of a wholesale purchaser of private health insurance coverage for the indigent who could then access private health care.This change, together with the Mental Health Parity Act, has changed the way these services are provided. Laws such as the U.S. Drug Free Workplace Act have also contributed to awareness of the need for EAPs. in October 2000, Puerto Rico's Mental Health Law (Law #408) was passed, establishing updated regulations for service delivery and protecting the rights of mental health patients. In August 2002, Puerto Rico Law #167 was approved, authorizing government agencies to establish Employee Assistance Programs and empowering the Puerto Rico Mental Health &Anti-Addiction Services Administration (\"ASSMCA \") to oversee its implementation. ASSMCA is charged with advising and providing technical assistance to agencies of the executive branch and municipal governments.These services may also be contracted by private enterprise. ASSMCA will monitor the implementation and functioning of EAPs in state government agencies. It will also certify that privately contracted EAP providers serving government agencies meet legal requirements. ASSMCA is currently developing the regulations for implementation of the law. 163 EAP P~ovineRs In Puerto Rico EAPs are typically offered in one of the following ways: internal EAPs in some government agencies and large public corporations, as well as a few large organizations in the private sector. External EAPs, contracted directly by local organizations in the private and public sectors, including insular and municipal government agencies. External EAP providers, providing service as part of the employee's health insurance coverage. This alternative is especially attractive to small, local firms that are able to obtain lower capitation rates than they might with a direct contract with an external EAP. External EAP providers, subcontracted by national or international EAPs to serve local offices or uranches o1' large corporations that purchase these services at a national or corporate IeveL It is noteworthy that the major health insurance companies in Puerto Rico have given strong support to the EAP, recognizing long before many employers that it brings added value to the coverage it can offer its subscribers. Companies such as Cruz Azul de Puerto Rico, Triple-S, Humana, MCS, COSVI, Cigna, Canada Life/MAPFRE and PALIC now offer the EAP as a basic or optional service. Several local institutions in Puerto Rico offer external EAP services. Puerto Rico has an active chapter of EAPA (Asociacidn de Profesionales de Ayuda al Empleado or \"APAE\"). EAPs in Puerto Rico are also becoming aware of standards of excellence and ethical practice developed by organizations such as EASNA and EAPA. There is increasing emphasis on quality improvement and program evaluation, which can be expected to contribute to improved services provided by EAPs in Puerto Rico.The opportunity to apply for accreditation by the Council on Accreditation (COA) also encourages local EAPs to strive to meet these high standards. Various EAP service models are offered in Puerto Rico, ranging from telephone information and referral services to short-term counseling models.The most typical model includes the following features: Brief,short -term counseling of varying duration, provided by experienced mental health professionals, primarily psychologists and some clinical social workers and psychiatrists. Comprehensive coverage for all personal problems Eligibility of family members of employees (often defined in a broad way to include the employee's extended family) Referral and follow-up to community resources for specialized or long-term care Critical Incident Stress Debriefing for traumatic workplace events Education and outreach efforts to reach troubled employees, such as health fairs and workshops 164 Account management which includes program design, policy and procedures development, supervisory and employee training plus general employee and family awareness campaigns Professional consultation to supervisors and human resource officials EAP services in Puerto Rico are offered in primarily in Spanish, with English as a second language. Some EAPs also offer legal and financial orientation services. CURRENT ISSUES 1. Significant social and economic problems in Puerto Rico pose challenges to EAPs in serving individual employees and their families,as well as the customer organization,These problems include: an unemployment rate of 12.2%^; , ;;i~fi ic~~i~;=nce of mental disorders and substance abuse, often undiagnosed and untreated; ._.. high rates of violent crime, including domestic violence, armed robberies in the workplace, and street crime; growing population of the elderlys; weakening of the extended family and local community support networks that have characterized Puerto Rican cul- ture in the past; corporations seeking to increase worker productivity and reduce expenses in order to remain competitive in the glob- al market thus placing more pressure on employees to perform and higher expectations toward EAPs to keep them on the job. concern about rising health care and insurance costs. 2, In response tothe socio-economic climate of the island, EAPs are being called upon to develop effective and rapid delivery of services such as Critical Incident Stress Debriefing to assist organizations affected by workplace violence, hold-ups, downsizing and shutdowns.There is a need for well-trained personnel to provide these services. 3. Certain occupational groups, such as teachers, health care workers,and law enforcement personnel are under significant stress and need the support of EAPs. By receiving this assistance, they will be better equipped to perform their important roles in the community. 4.The scope of the EAP has been debated. Due to the lack of high quality, low cost mental health services accessible to the general public, EAPs fill a need in the area of community mental health. As such, EAP models limited to one to three face- to-face sessions (primarily assessment and referral) face the challenge of where to refer the client for further assistance r when counseling or psychotherapy is needed. By including more counseling sessions, the EAP can help many more clients, often without the need for referral. 165 5. Aggressive, competitive pricing has resulted in EAP providers being caught between their desire to offer a full range of services and the reality of the price customers are willing to pay. There is concern that the quality of service could be compromised when the EAP has to struggle for economic viability or survival. 6. Cultural sensitivity and relevance. When attempting to apply \"imported\" EAP models that are effective In other socio-cultural settings, it becomes evident that adjustments are required.The \"one size fits all\" view of EAP models falls short of meeting the needs of Puerto Rico and many other locations worldwide. History, language, values, .political dynamics, family relations, and the state of the local economy are all elements that must be considered in offering an EAP in a particular setting, 7.The scarcity of government resources and the lack of specialized EAP training for psychologists and social workers are factors that have limited the growth and development of EAPs in Puerto Rico. The possibility of developing post- graduate certification programs for EA professionals is currently under consideration. CONCLUSION EAPs in Puerto Rico must have bold, wide-ranging strategies to meet the ever-changing needs of both employees and the organizations for which they work.lnnovative program development should be paired with ongoing quality improvement and outcome evaluation. Puerto Rico's EAPs stand poised at a door of great opportunity as they face these challenges, There is vast potential for what they can contribute to workplace productivity, employee wellness, reduction of health care costs, organizational climate, and community mental health. The most successful Employee Assistance Programs are those that are innovative, flexible and willing to constantly exam- ine workplace needs. Beyond the workplace, many people in the surrounding community do not have access to the EAP and cannot afford to pay for private mental health services.That community also affects employee productivity in diverse ways. Puerto Rico presents an excellent opportunity to create an effective alliance among EAPs, mental health and substance abuse treatment providers (public and private), non-profit community -based service organizations, and corporations in the private sector. By extending the reach of the EAP beyond their employees, private enterprise can contribute to the quality of life of the Puerto Rican communityvi.Working in partnership with mental health organizations, human resources, government agencies and non-proFlt community -based service organizations, EAPs can increase their positive impact on work-life stress and worker productivity. There is a need for closer collaboration, coordination of services, and joint planning and needs analysis among these different sectors, all within the framework of Corporate Social Responsibility. 166 RESOURCES AND EAP PROVIDERS Several large EAPs based in the U.S, provide services in Puerto Rico, including Ceridian, Cigna Behavioral Health,Compsych, FHC Health Systems, and Magellan.

PAUL MAIDEN: BACKGROUND Russia moves forward into the twenty-first century with great hope and enthusiasm.ln recent years,there have been cycles of peaks and financial crises in the Russian economy. There were many opportunities but little stability, with a significant number of failures. People who thought they were living in a time of predictability, with choices, were soon shocked into the reality of an unstable economy. This lack of a stable economic foundation affected everyone. There is little doubt that a need exists for a structured service program to help employees and their families cope with the dramatic changes.ln addition; employees from other countries face additional challenges adjusting to a uniquely challenging work climate.The families of international employees often find themselves facing cultural barriers and a very difficult daily life. EMPLOYER AWARENESS OF EAPS Some employers are already realizing the benefits of health insurance, fitness clubs, and family support that in turn have benefited productivity. International managers of large corporations are confronted with the difficult task of dealing with cultural attitudes towards work that makes team building and commitment toward common goals difficult to achieve. There often is little time left for Employee Assistance Programs. Through the last decade, the need for psychological intervention in the workplace has been gaining recognition. However, it is usually limited to employee performance, communication issues, decision- making, team building, and. coaching. EAP RELATED POSITIONS To satisfy the need for the above-mentioned services, some external and internal training /coaching providers are beginning to appear. Very few of them have an understanding of international EAP standards, Within the last decade, training for psychologists and social workers has been provided in university settings.There often is little opportunity for practical application before graduation. In general, confusion exists concerning the role of psychologists or social workers in EAPs. As a result, many of those who have achieved a specialized degree to be qualified to work in EAP and related programs are unable to find work or are employed in settings where their skills are underutilized.There also are very few licensing requirements to practice as a social worker or psychologist, let alone an EAP practitioner. A small number of psychiatrists and psychologists have managed to achieve an educational level and degree of competence to meet European and international standards for their services. Most of this training. however, is focused on psychotherapeutic modalities such as psychoanalysis, psychodrama cognitive behavioral therapy, positive psychotherapy, gestalfi; NLP, body oriented therapy, etc. A smaller number have managed to get EAP oriented training outside of Russia 169 through conference attendance. Those who have completed an education in some of the previously mentioned fields often are engaged in private practice and are not working in the corporate setting, STATUS OF EAPS Employee assistance program development remains in its infancy in Russia. However, there are a few small pockets of human service workplace activity showing some promise, Dr. Paul Maiden, Director of the School of Social Work at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, has begun to collaborate with Udmurt State University Faculty of Psychology and Pedagogy and Faculty of Oil and Gas in the development of employee assistance curriculum and training. Udmurt State University is located in Izhevsk in the oil rich Udmurt Republic located approximately 1,000 miles east of Moscow. Dr, Maiden has been working with the university for two years and has visited on a number of occasions to discuss - the development of workplace substance abUSe.prggrams.as.vy~l1 as domestic t~;cilence prev~nt~~n Y:~,\u00b0~:~rams \u2014both significant social problems in Russia. Most recently he was awarded a Senior Fulbright by the U.S, State Department for the specific puYpose of curriculum development, faculty training and consultation, and training area employers (predominantly in the oil and gas fields) on the development of employee assistance programs. Much of his work will be a replication of prior EAP development work he was involved in throughout the 1990s in the gold mining industry in South Africa. Both Deans of the two participating departments at Udmurt State University are enthusiastic and optimistic about the. potential development of EAP training programs. The Dean of the Faculty of Oil and Gas has indicated that alcohol abuse is a significant problem in the oil industry in Russia and that the introduction of employee assistance programs in the Russian workplace could. bean effective method in helping to curtail workplace alcohol abuse. Dr. Maiden has also visited with the social work fatuity at the University of St. Petersburg to discuss the development of EAP curriculum and creating workshops to train employers groups on the value of EAPs. However, the receptivity to the concept of employee assistance was met with much less enthusiasm in the large urban region of St, Petersburg than in the industrial area of Izhevsk.The social work faculty at St. Petersburg State University acknowledges the value of employee assistance as a workplace intervention particularly in the industrial sector such as the oil and gas fields where alcohol use and abuse on the job is known to be quite high.They also pointed out, however, that unemployment in Russia is quite high and that they believed it would be quite unlikely that employers would invest in an employee assistance program to help troubled employees. Rather, their position was that given the high rate of unemployment and the high number of unemployed workers hoping forjobs, employers would take what they consider the most expedient route and simply fire the problem employee as there is always a long line of unemployed workers waiting outside the door, ready to go to work on a moments notice. 170 A SAMPLING OF EAP PROVIDERS IN RUSSIA Dr. Ivan 0. Kirillov has worked with the ex-pats community in Moscow for the last few years and was invited in 2002 to attend the meeting of European EAPs in Wiesbaden (Germany). He may be one of the first professionals who brought this idea to Russfa. Since then, the International Guidelines for EAPs have been translated into Russian. Some employers have begun to read these articles. During the past year and a half, Dr. Kiriilov has provided employee assistance type services in the local community in Moscow. In addition, several colleagues in Khabarovsk and Vladivostok are applying international standards in their respective settings, A colleague and U.S. licensed social worker, Danny St. Louis, is providing consultative assistance to a number of U.S. companies with employees in Russia. RESOURCES AND EAP PROVIDERS R. Paul Maiden, Ph.D. Director, School of Social Work University of Central Florida Editor,Journal of Work Place Behavioral Health; Employee Assistance Practice EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN SINGAPORE BY ANG PENG CHYE BACKGROUND Singapore is an island republic of 225 square miles, situated at the southern tip of the Malaysian peninsula. An estimated 4,500,000 (July 2003) people dive in Singapore, 75 percent of whom are between the ages of 15 and 64.There are more than one million expatriates and foreign workers in Singapore. It is a developed nation, harboring a niche of service-producing industries (e,g. banking, transport, and communications) and goods-producing Industries (e.g. petrochemicals, biosciences, and electronics). As of June 2004, the unemployment rate is 4.5 percent. SINGAPORE SOCIETY Singapore is an Asian society with a history of British colonial rule. i-~sian societies are generally structured with the collective taking precedent over the individual and are suffused with benevolent paternalism.The \"I\"therefore is a part of the \"We.\"The leader does \"what he does\"for\"us.\"Stability of the group or the family is primary and individuals are expected to conform or fit in. As \"I\" am part of a \"We,\"\"I\"have to be careful of what \"I\" do for it may affect \"We\" or bring shame to \"We.\"Therefore, the \"I\" labors under a lot of expectations to keep up, to conform and to perform. It is hardly surprising that stress levels are very high in Singapore society.ln a community mental health survey in 1989,one in five Singaporeans reported symptoms of minor psychiatric morbidity. The need to maintain \"face\" makes it difficult for individuals to seek help. When the individual is under pressure, he has to avoid bringing attention to himself and the group. An admission that he has difficulty coping and asking for assistance would bring unwanted spotlight on the self, unless that model is constructed as part of self-improvement and enhancement. STATUS OF EAPS .DRIVERS OF EAP IN SINGAPORE STRESS AT WORK My interest in employee assistance programs (EAPs) in Singapore began in the early 1990s, as I was seeing an increasing number of people with work stress leading to anxiety and depression, However, people had a lot of fear about seeking help. I founded the Centre for Effective Living with a group of psychiatrists and psychologists to promote early mental health interventions. 172 Initially, we were involved with running stress management training workshops for a number of multi-national corporations (MNCs) and government -linked Singapore corporations (GLCs). These workshops gave us a pulse of the workplace and an understanding of the pressures on the employee as he attempts to juggle the expectations placed on him by society, his company, his family, and himself. From information collected in the workshops, we presented to senior management in the companies a report on mental health concerns.This led to further involvement by my team on developing workplace mental health enhancement strategies and training programmes. In the early 1990s, individuals who needed further mental health intervention had to inform the company medical officer who then made a referral for further service.Thus, confidentiality was compromised. Alternately, the employee could pay for these interventions on his own. As a result, many who needed help did not seek help.. In the mid-1990s, we embarked on actively promoting employee assistance programs on a capitation basis. Many of the MNCs are aware of EAP,especially if fihey are companies based in the United States or Europe. However,many of the Human Resource Managers felt there was no need for EAPs in Singapore. Fortunately,our data from stress management workshops helped change some minds.Today, we provide EAP services to a number of MNCs as well as GLCs in Singapore and a few other local psychological service organizations also provide EAP to companies. FROM \"ASSISTANCE \"TO \"ENHANCEMENT & ATTAINMENT OF POTENTIAL\" Words mean different things to different people. The word \"assistance\" in my society implies a \"person in need.\"Ina face- oriented, shame-avoidant society, employee assistance carries a stigma. In our experience, EAP has to be promoted as a way of building personal effectiveness in the workplace. Hence, we use \"enhancement and attainment of potential\" as our process. We promote better ways of doing things, we teach skills, and we provide information.The employee in Singapore is generally keen to Iearn.This approach also fits into the Singapore government's encouragement of the workforce to strive for\"life-long learning.\" In Singapore, EAPs are more likely to be accepted when they are positioned as enhancement and as attaining of potential, DRUG &ALCOHOL POLICIES Services develop to meet a need. In the United States, EAP developed because of the need for alcohol and drug intervention programmes and eventually grew to include other aspects of assistance. In Singapore, we have very strict laws governing the use of drugs, including capital punishment for selling drugs and compulsory random urine checks for suspected drug users. Overall, this policy has been very successful at preventing drug abuse in the country. Initially, when EAP was introduced, some companies were anxious about the possibility of detecting a drug user. Would the drug user have to go 173 into a drug rehabilitation centre run by the penal system? In Singapore, we have clarified that a drug user who declares himself before he is caught need not be punished. He can choose to go into treatment at a hospital facility.This reassured many employers, and companies adopted EAP. In companies where safety is a priority, compulsory reporting and treatment of drug and alcohol problems is a part of the EAP program. EAP FOR EXPATRIATES There are many MNCs in Singapore, employing a significant number of expatriates, many of whom have some problems as they cope with working in this new environment. Many of these workers are aware of EAP in their home countries, and are asking for similar services in Singapore for themselves and their families. Indeed, many of our early EAP programs were rolled out first for the expatriate population who requested this service. OvFr tim^, EAP service was extended ~~ ~~ n~~~.'!n ~~n~~r-'~r^ ~!~. need is driven by the stress in the population as our society drives relentlessly toward progress and developed nation status, even though we have few natural resources.The societal psyche of using insecurity to drive progress together tyith fear of shame if we do not succeed, puts tremendous pressure on the individual. Psychiatric morbidity is on the increase, indicating a need for EAP as a support mechanism. GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS AND THEIR INITIATIVES Government organizations \u2014like the Health Promotion Board of the Ministry of Health, the Work Life Unit of the Ministry of Community Development,Youth, and Sports and the Occupational Health Department of the Ministry of Manpower\u2014 areaware of the need for positive work-life and preventive mental health strategies,Theyare active in providing grants for healthy work-life initiatives. The Singapore National Employers Federation, SPRING Singapore (Standards, Productivity and Innovation Board), and the National Trade Union Congress have also recently been promoting employee health and fitness strategies in the workplace. Services in Singapore are constructed on partnership models.The Government sets policies that it believes are good for the people.The policies are pushed into the community for discussion and action.The implementation often is funded by grants and subventions from the government, with co-payment by individuals or groups using the service. The recent interest in mental health concerns can drive EAP development in Singapore. 174 EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN SOUTH AFRICA BY ANDREW DAVIES AND LOURIE TERBLANCHE BACKGROUND The Republic of South Africa occupies 1,219,080 square kilometers on the Southern tip of the African continent and is divided into 9 provinces. It has a population of 44.8 million according to the Central Statistical Service's 2001 census, and is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in Africa with 11 official languages. South Africa is a developing country with an abundant supply of resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors, and a modern infrastructure rivaling that of developed countries. It also has many of the characteristics of developing countries, including a division of labor between formal and informal sectors and uneven ;distribution of wealth and income. The exclusionary nature of apartheid and the distortions caused by the country's international isolation until the 1990s have resulted in major economic problems. Unemployment is currently estimated at 28.2% and other daunting social and economic challenges remain, especially the problems of poverty and lack of economic empowerment amongst historically disadvantaged groups.Other problems include crime, HIV/AIDS and violence against women and children. The economy is now in a process of transition as the government seeks to address the inequities of apartheid, stimulate growth and create jobs. Business is becoming more integrated.into the international economic system foreign investment has increased dramatically over the past few years, and opportunities in education and business are commonplace. Although ethnic strife played a significant role in South Africa's history and politics, the post-apartheid government of South Africa has made remarkable progress in consolidating the nation's peaceful transition to democracy. However, major social and economic challenges remain. STATUS OF EAPS A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF EAPS IN SOUTH AFRICA The origin of EAPs in South Africa can be traced to 1986 with the creation of occupational counselling centers by the Chamber of Mines to provide structured EAP services to the mining industry.These centers later merged to form the Centre for Human Development (CHD)\u2014the first EAP provider organization in South Africa.The organization remains inexistence today\u2014having gone through several mergers with other leading EAP and physical healthcare provider organizations to form The Careways Group\u2014and is currently the largest external EAP provider in the country. A number of organizations outside the mining industry also implemented EAPs during the 1980s\u2014 largely through the 175 influence of occupational health nurses. The raison d'etre for such programs was one of \"internal social responsibility\" rather than of business or HR strategy (Harper, 2000}, EAPs tended to be internal (residing largely within occupational health clinics) and were limited in scope, status and influence within the organization. The 1990s saw the transition to a democratic government and new economic and social policies (such as the Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) strategy) to achieve sustained economic growth and redress the socio-economic disparities created by apartheid. Since then, EAPs in South Africa have grown dramatically in number and evolved considerably in nature\u2014in response to influences within and outside the workplace. The South African Chapter of EAPA-Inc. (EAPA-SA) was established in March 1996 and the first board was elected to represent the interests of vendor organizations, internal programs, interest groups and academic institutions. Membership ,,:, . of the association has grown substantially since this time and a constitutional set of standards and code of ethics for the profession has been developed and published. Although limited in resources, EAPA-SA has played a role in establishing fundamental professional ethics and standards for the profession and in promoting dialogue amongst practitioners within the field and with other professional associations and legislative bodies. Research conducted by Tracy Harper revealed that, by 1996, 42% of South Africa's top 100 companies had implemented EAPs. Over the past decade, the growth of EAPs has been apparent in most sectors of the economy with organizations adopting various models of service delivery. Although no formal research has been conducted since the 1996 Harper survey, it is estimated that more than 70% of South Africa's top 100 companies, and a growing number of small and medium size enterprises, have implemented EAPs. While a significant number of organizations in South Africa continue to employ internal models of EAP service delivery,the trend has been towards the outsourcing, of EAP services to external service providers or the adoption of a'mixed' model of service delivery. There are currently 4 major external EAP vendors in South Africa (the Careways Group, ICAS Southern Africa, Procare and LCI) and an ever-increasing number of regional vendors. These providers differ extensively in the structure, scope, focus and model of service delivery and continue to evolve at a relatively rapid rate in response to changing conditions within society and the workplace as well as growing competition within the industry. While occupational social workers continue to dominate the EAP field in South Africa the wide range of models of service delivery and the diverse nature of services offered under the EAP umbrella have attracted the participation of professionals from. many disciplines.The most notable of these are psychology, medicine, occupational health, commerce, management consulting, law, and information technology, As in the USA, Australia and other parts of the world where EAPs are commonplace, EAPs in South Africa have expanded and evolved beyond their initial scope. For a variety of reasons (not the least of which is the absence of a 176 state welfare system) South African EAPs have tended to provide a more comprehensive model of intervention than the \"assess and refer\" model prevalent in many more developed countries. Although age-old debates continue (amongst those entering the field) regarding the merits of internal versus external service provision, on-site versus off-site locality, managerial versus self-referral and performance versus treatment focus, South Africa's EAP profession has developed and matured to a point where a variety of models have established themselves within the country. This variety reflects a diversity of orientation and mode of operation. The \"broad brush\" approach (incorporating psycho-social counselling and support, CISD, practical assistance related to work/life management issues, managerial support and referral, dependent support, and organizational consultancy) has been adopted by the majority of vendors in the country.The incorporation of HIV/AIDS programs, on-line EAP services, health and wellness programs, expatriate support, and concierge services (amongst others) into the broad brush service offering is also on the increase, and reflects the evolving needs of a society and economy in transition. The South African market has also seen the emergence of specialist consultants in the EAP field. As the EAP profession develops and matures in South Africa, assessment and accountability requirements have increased, with funding to some extent dependent on demonstrating positive results. Specialist EAP consultants play a vital role in assisting both purchasers and vendors of EAP services to conduct needs analyses, design appropriate programs, train and upskill practitioners and program coordinators, select appropriate services, and audit and manage programs. Mkhize Harper & Associates is the most well known specialist consultancy in South Africa. EDUCATION AND TRAINING Although no statutory body for the registration and accreditation of EAP professionals exists in South Africa, rapid growth, increased competition, ongoing diversification and increasing professionalism within the EAP field in South Africa has encouraged more and more practitioners to seek formal training in EAPs in order to develop specialist expertise and competencies. Several leading academic institutions include training in EAPs in their 4-year Bachelors Degrees in Social Work and two universities are now offering specialist graduate -level training in this area. in 2001 the University of Pretoria introduced training of EAP professionals at a Masters level for social workers and related disciplines (i.e.psychology, NR management,education, occupational health, etc.).Training focuses mainly on the historical development of the EAP, models of EAP and OD, as well as professional standards, ethics and methods of therapeutic practice. In 2004 the University of the Western Cape introduced aone-year diploma in Employee Assistance programs aligned with the Certified Employee Assistance Professional credentials process. The University of the Witwatersrand offers a masters course in Occupational Social Work which includes substantial content on fAPs. In order to meet and further encourage the ongoing education of EAP Professionals, a number of short courses are now available in South Africa.The most comprehensive of these include: 177 an intensive weeklong course on EAPs run by Mkhize Harper &Associates in association with Brenda Blaire (this covers both the fundamentals of the profession as well as more in-depth workshops on specific aspects of EAPs). a short course on EAPs by the University of Pretoria in conjunction with The Careways Group.This course has been running since 1998 and successful candidates receive a certificate on completion of the required examination. Numerous EAP specific conferences and workshops are convened in major South African cities during the course of Qach year and a considerable amount of training is now available to meet the training needs of EAP professionals. All training \u2014including EAP related training \u2014is required to comply with the requirements of the South African Qualifications Authority to ensure that minimum standards are maintained by trainers in the EAP profession. CURRENT ISSUES AND TRENDS There are several factors in both the workplace and broader society that have affected the growth and development of EAPs in South Africa, and are likely to continue to influence their prevalence, structure. and oaeration in the foreseeable future. The most significant factor influencing the growth and development of EAP3 in South Africa is HIV/AIDS. South Africa is one of the countries most affected by HIV with 5-6 million HIV infected individuals. Nearly 25% of the 15-49 year old population is infected and about 2,300 new infections occur each day. Approximately 40% of adult deaths and 25% of ail. deaths are due to AIDS.Without effective prevention and treatment; 5-7 million cumulative AIDS deaths are anticipated by 2010.Over the past decade, national government leadership has failed to effectively address the epidemic, although a prevention strategy was initiated in 2002 and substantial funding for antiretroviral therapy was announced by the Cabinet in 2003. Partly as a result of government's ineffectual response to the pandemic, and largely as a result of the obvious risk posed by the pandemic to productivity and the national economic climate, South African organizations (both in the public and private sectors) have taken responsibility for the development of HIV/AIDS management programs\u2014 frequently,although not always, in association with EAP providers. Government has only recently formally addressed the issue in the public service through the Department of Public Services and Administration - instrucfiing government departments to conduct a)I HIV/AIDS initiatives through their EAPs. EAP professionals are unanimous in their belief that EAPs have a critical role to play in the management of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. EAPA-SA focused its 2002 annual conference exclusively on the rode of EAPs in managing the pandemic, and almost all vendors include HIV/AIDS management services in their overall EAP service offerings. Services offered through the EAP include specialized HIV/AIDS assessment, policy development, education, counselling, support and consultancy services. HIV/AIDS has been a significant driving force behind the broadening of EAP services in South Africa to incorporate physical health and wellbeing related services into the traditional stable of services. Several EAP vendors have further extended this move towards physical health service provision by adding a range of services that have fallen outside those traditionally 178 offered by South African vendors.These include absenteeism disease and disability management; occupational health and safety audits; e-health; executive medical assessment and on-site primary health and occupational health clinic provision. The EAP profession has a.unique and important contribution to make to the management of HIV/AIDS and certain aspects of physical illness in South Africa. However, a danger exists that an exaggerated focus on these aspects of employee wellbeing and a \"one-stop-shop\"approach to healthcare in its broadest sense could overshadow or dilute the focused role that EAPs play in the management of a critical range of behavioral, social, emotional and work-related problems and challenges. If this trend continues, EAPs in South Africa could be consumed in the not too distant future by Managed behavioral Health Care/Insurance organizations with a shift in focus towards behavioral health benefit management. Over the past decade, the world of work in general been characterized by dramatic technological, structural and social changes.The South African economy has also been characterized by rapid and wide-ranging transformation and change. In an effort to boost economic growth, spur job creation, increase prod~.ir.,tiv~ty end create a fay%nr?h!e investment climate, and at the same time redress social inequalities and economic disparities,the South African government has introduced a number of bold economic strategies and policies.These include the privatization of parastatal organizations and employment equity Iegisiation.The impact of transformation and change on individual and organizational wellbeing and productivity in both the public and private sectors of the South African economy has been extensive and far-reaching. Given the skill set of EAP practitioners, EAPs are well positioned to assist both individuals and organizations to address and manage the behavioral health challenges created by transformation, change and diversity. It remains critical that EAPs in South Africa should have the capacity to deliver services that are relevant and appropriate to the linguistic and cultural needs of South Africa's diverse population. Probably the biggest stressor in the lives of South Africans is the fear of being a victim (or repeat victim) of violent crime. For a variety of complex social, political and economic reasons (not the least of which is the unemployment rate of 28.2%) South Africa has one of the highest incidences of murder,rape,assault,familyviolence and child-abuse in the world.Violent assault is second only to HIV/AIDS as the leading cause of death in the country. According to published data, more than 80% of South African households have experienced crime in one form or another over the past two years.According to a recent survey, the average South African township. dweller considers the greatest problems facing him/her to be murder first and rape of children second.The South African Police Services in their semester report declare that\"the incidence of crime in the country is still at a high and definitely unacceptable level\".Given these statistics and the limited resources of the national health sysfiem and non-governmental organizations in dealing with victims of violence and crime, the role of the EAP in the management of psychological trauma and its personal and organizational consequences is beyond question. The majority of EAPs in South Africa include extensive training, counselling, support and consultancy on psychological trauma and critical incident stress management. No EAP-specific legislation has been formulated within the South African context. However, a number of acts introduced into the South African legislative environment over the past decade have placed a significant duty of protective, therapeutic 179 and rehabilitative responsibility on employers.The level of support enjoyed by employee assistance endeavors has swelled as a direct result of legislation that requires employers to address issues that impact on an employee's health and safety in the workplace. Legislation of relevance in this regard includes: The labor Relations Act (particularly the Code of Good Practice); the Occupational Health and Safety Act; The Disabilities Act; the Basic Conditions of Employment Act; and-the Employment Equity Act. Changing health care legislation applicable to Medical Insurance organizations could also influence the growth and development of EAPs in the near future. EAPs need to ensure that they are relevantly and appropriately positioned to help organizations to meet their legislative requirements. CONCLUSION The evolution of EAPs in South Africa has been shaped by the country's diverse and rapidly changing social, political and economic environment. The need for a motivated, productive workforce is an integral part of the country's strategy for formula to meet changing circumstances and new challenges. There is little doubt that the profession will continue to develop in new directions and cannot and should not be restricted from doing so. What we must ensure, however, is that EAP services adhere to agreed ethics and standards within the profession, are delivered systematically and professionally, support both employees and organizations in terms of performance and health, and remain relevant and appropriate to the diverse requirements of business, government and the broader society. iEii7 RESOURCES AND EAP PROVIDERS Andrew Davies,MA ICAS Southern Africa Moorgate Building Dunkeld Park 6 North Road Dunkeld West JOHANNESBURG 2196 PO Box 960 Northlands 2116 South ~ , ,,~; K Central Office Park 16th Avenue MIDRAND JOHANNESBURG' 1684 South Africa Contact: Andre van Kensington 2094 JOHANNESBURG PO Box 46 Bruma 2026 - Pravesh Bhoodram Plessis, in South Africa'; Employee Assistance Quarterly,14(3),19 -40.

EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN SPAIN BY MARIA CERVERA GOIZUETA BACKGROUND Social workers in Spain are established in the public social services, but have not yet developed the Occupational field and are mainly working with public organizations and Non-Government Associations,Their main field of assistance deals with finding economic resources but with counselling, In Spain, EAP is a new concept but known in some economic sectors. Because of the common language the development of EAPs in Angio-Saxon countries (the US, the UK, Australia and South Africa) has been easier than in other countries. When we first tried to introd,uce.EAPs, n.Spain in 198 notone ~f \u00b1he !-{R ~~: ~s~~rs or Managing Directors had heard the term before. Despite the lack of familiarity with this service in the Human Resources field, the HR managers of the leading companies were very enthusiastic and perceived the need for this type of service. One challenge involved building our affiliates network, as there are no EAP counselors in Spain. We had to develop a network of psychologists who could give counselling sessions on ashort-term basis with CBT backgrouncl.These psychologists were very reluctant at the beginning to be working for an organization instead of as individual professionals. After these initial years the EAP program includes: 24 hour phone access (mainly in Spanish, but other languages can beaccessed \u2014English, French, Italian) Family coverage if requested Life Management service (Legal, Finances, Childcare, Eldercare, Psychosocial Resources) Free initial face to face legal consultation Telephone Counselling (emotional, marital, family, relationships, health di~culties, harassment, bullying; stress, drug or alcohol abuse) Face to Face Counselling (affiliate network of 140 psychologists all over Spain trained in different clinical psychology fields like trauma, bereavement, short-term therapy) Daily management Full case management Utilization reports and reviews implementation consultancy Days on-site briefing Employee leaflet and plastic wallet card Dedicated account manager Concierge services (optional) 183 EAP PROVIDERS IN THE AREA Some health insurance companies say they provide EAP services in Spain; some international providers have a call center in the UK and answer the calls in English.ICAS Spain is the sole provider of these services in Spanish. The service has been adapted to the standards of ICAS International but adapted for the Spanish population.

Language serves as an interesting example. Swedes, Norwegians and Danes can understand each other, given the wish to do so, and with some patience. Finnish is a completely different language, rather more linked to Hungarian, These similarities and differences are but one aspect of the variety within the Nordic market. The three Scandinavian countries may be the cradle of the Vikings, but many things, have changed and developed since our ancestors started their own way of trading hPr~een each other, anti ~~~t into the world! These language differences also reflect cultural and social differences in the Nordic countries. For instance, the countries have dealt very difFerent~y in their thinking and actions about organizations, leadership and relations between management and employees.One example \u2014an organization that merged over the border of Denmark and Sweden found itself faced with major problems regarding leadership style.The easygoing, clearly very directive and no-nonsense Danish style collided with the Swedish where a very long tradition of negotiation and consensus is what is regarded as\"normal \"behavior. STATUS OF EAPS The tradition in the Nordic area has been, for many years, a strong consciousness about the importance of the well being of the workforce, This has been ensured by strong HR personnel and the unions, There has also been along- tradition of integrated occupational health care.This OH has traditionally been very focused on somatic care. The idea of psychosocially related issues has not been especially highlighted, and the idea of needing counselling, advice or therapy has always been connected with serious mental illness rather than as a part of everyday Iife,People seeing a psychologist or psychotherapist did not talk about it. As for such treatment and its relation to the workplace, people would hide it as a taboo; it was commonly felt that disclosing would harm future career possibilities etc. Relationships in-the workplace were treated more with a focus on conflict and thus handled by the management and the union, rather than as interpersonal relationship issues, These trends and tendencies have of course transformed over the years. But, up until rather recently, this situation has created a very immature market for programs such as EAPs. 185 SWEDEN The Swedish economy has followed the world economy in its ups and downs, but maybe with somewhat less damage in the downs as the economy, globally, has been rather strong. Sweden is unique in the Nordic area as the one country that has not been involved directly in wars for almost two hundred years. This naturally has enabled the country to build a strong economy and good internal and external marketplace relationships. The organizational infrastructure has built on some great Swedish inventions and strong company. founders, such as Ericsson, SAAB, Volvo, ABB, and IKEA. The traditional Swedish natural resources, forest and mining, have also helped to create a solid foundation for Swedish economy and trade. This has been connected to the. politically very stable situation. For most of the past fifty years a Social Democratic governance.of;,thc,country: has built ~itrori7 ?n~-!\u00b0;~~~sr,.~~: ~ i~~iii~ratic relationships with other parts of the world. (Dag Hammarskjold and Olof Palme represent these types of relationships.) With the building and growing of the European. Union, Sweden has had a natural place in the Union. By contrast, in a famous referendum Norway voted no. Norway,on the other hand, is part of NATO; Sweden due to the neutrality policy, does not belong to NATO. The Swedish cost for medical and health services for 1992 was approximately 109 billion SEK and has risen to 178 billion SEK in 2000.ThaYs 8.5% of GNP, (Swedish Institute 2004.) More than 78% of all women aged 20-64 are employed (1999.) Parents are legally entitled to 480 days paid leave from work at the birth of a chiid.The legislation says the father must use at least 60 of the days. Parents can use up to 60 days annually to take care of a sick child with 80% of their salary paid by the state. Sweden has a Child Allowance consisting of 950 SEK per child per month. (Forsakringskassan, 2004.) There is a very well bunt up day care system for children up to school age (6 years) in Sweden, which is paid by the local communities. Parents pay a low, additional, fee. Afternoon care for school children up to 12 years is also provided by the public sector, for a nominal fee. Sick leave is paid by the employer with 80% of the salary up to 21 days. After three weeks, the State Insurance Office (Forsakringskassan)takes over the payment.The employer is responsible for establishing a rehabilitation plan for employees who remain ill more than 4 weeks. This means that employers have a good incentive to keep employers healthy. The number of days paid by the employer has risen dramatically in recent years, and is one of the factors that influence the interest in the market for EAPs. So upon this political, economical and social background, the first EAPs were introduced to the Swedish marketplace in the late 1980s. 186 EAPS IN SWEDEN Christer Sandahl, PhD, chartered Psychologist and Psychotherapist, President of IAGP (International Association of Group Psychotherapy) was the first person to start the long and difficult introduction of EAP as a concept into the Swedish econ- omy.The obstacles were many, as was hinted above: The HR Directors had a tradition of taking care of the psychosocial issues in the organization themselves. The unions had a tradition of taking care of workplace conflict issues themselves. The Occupational Health departments were often internal.They had the support of legislation, and a long history of quality and caretaking.They were essentially focussed on somatic problems, but so was the whole of society. The management level of many organizations was quifie happy with how the organizations were working, and why add to or change a successful way of doing things? Even though (or-just because ?) we were in the height of a rocketing economy,the human issues were not focussed on, at least not in this new and innovative way..:. There were also suspicions regarding EAPs: were they a control tool for employers? Were they something foreign to Swedish legislation and traditional ways of thinking and working? Were they some sort of employee subversive tool? (What if EVERY employee would start calling?) In this climate of prosperity and suspicion, to introduce something new to this market was very difficult, to put it mildly. It took some strong and daring front persons to have the courage to be the first ones to buy and implement an EAP. ILLNESS ABSENTEEISM IN SWEDEN Illness absenteeism has grown rapidly in Sweden, as well as in the other Nordic countries. The paradox is that somatic health is blooming \u2014never have so many been so healthy physically; the illness rates are, thus, frightening, The Swedish Government has introduced several big surveys to understand why the healthiest people in Europe also are the ones with the highest sickness rates.The answer was astonishing: although people are OK physically,theyare in bad emotional and mental states. This is related both to stress in the workplace and to the work private life balance. Modern man is stressed beyond the inner capacity to handle it. Now, naturally, any remedy to this will be welcome. But how can we make sure that the EAP is the right medicine? This is where some research has been done in Scandinavia, but much more is needed.The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs wrote (January 2003):\"How do the Swedes feel today? Public health in Sweden has steadily improved in recent years, in terms of average life expectancy and mortality.Sincethe mid-1980s, the male average life expectancy has risen by 3.3 years, and that of females by 1.9 years.The risk of premature death is declining for almost all groups of society. However, at the same time a marked deterioration can be seen with regard to mental health problems such as anxiety, insomnia and unease.This applies to the entire population, but particularly to women. Every day, some 300,000 people claim sick leave in Sweden.This is double the figures of 1997. The incidence of sick leave is on the rise for all types of illness, and mental disorders. account for the greatest increase. Dealing with accelerating claims for.sick leave is a central issue for public health efforts. 187 The illness rates generally have lowered somewhat during 2004\u2014and in organizations where there is an EAP that also proves to be true, EAP PROVIDERS In the very early days, a company called Empatica tried to start as an EAP provider in Sweden. (See the last EAP Compendium report by Mary Sherman.) This company did not survive for long. Two competitors started, without much knowledge of each other to begin with. They developed in somewhat different ways, and started covering different parts of the Scandinavian market. The Danish company, DMC, which later changed into NMC (Nordic Mental Corporation), started basically in Denmark's public sector. Visavi, in Sweden, grew.o.ut of 5anelahi- Partners AB (see last report by Mary Sherman), awell-known consultancy firm founded by Christer Sandahl and Patricia Tudor Sandahl.Visavi started in the private sector,with Sweden's biggest bank as one of its first customers. NMC's concept is more closely linked to the traditional way of working. The employee makes a phone call to a reception center and is then called back by an expert in the area of the question. Visavi's EAP works in a slightly different way; the telephone counselling is a central, integrated part of the service, and any question will be assessed right from the start by a psychologist. Both providers have Life Management as part of their services. NMC is the biggest provider in Denmark, and Visavi is the biggest in Sweden. Visavi provides services in all the Nordic countries. Very soon, Visavi's interpretation of EAP (quality in every step, security, professionalism, etc.) attracted interest from international providers. In 2000,Visavi signed a partnership contract with ICAS Ltd (Independent Counselling and Advisory Services), Milton Keynes, UK.Visavi is providing an a license by ICAS, and Visavi is the exclusive subcontractor to all of ICAS' customers in the Nordic area.ICAS is by far the biggest provider in the UK,and probably in Europe with more than 600,000 employees covered by their services. ICAS is also known for'its thorough quality. in all the different aspects of service.This partnership had a profound impact on Visavi, as it could start providing services to Swedish employees and their relatives and colleagues worldwide. Visavi covers the public`sector as well as the private sector in Swedish organizational Iife.The biggest customer in the public sector is the Swedish Prison Authorities where all employees of the Swedish Prisons are covered (8,500 employees and their relatives.) This first contract opened up the public sector, which is now a growing part in the EAP market. 188 Visavi's services are conducted in five different languages: Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish and English. In Visavi's approach, the focus is on work life balance, taking in all stress moments, conflicts, troubles and worries that employees carry with them.The NMC productstresses alcoholism ,and is more focused on the remedy action plan; the Visavi concept focuses instead on the pro-active aspect of the service.Visavi strives to create health by exploring the d(fferent parts of life, . including physical health, mental health, private life, work life, organizational considerations and individual considerations. Visavi focuses strongly on serving a complementary role in cooperation with HR, OH and unions. NMC presents itself as more of an alternative to OH. EAPs in Sweden have a special niche in legislation,as the Law on Health and Sickness Care does not allow anonymity. Under that law, clients must give their name and social security code number to have access to the service of hospitals, doctors, and so forth. The EAPs are conducted under another law, which enables the full range of possibilities: Anonymity, Life Management, etc This is a sgnificant diffQrence:compared to OH services that always must work under the Law of Health and Sickness Care. Sweden has been spared many of the horrors that happen in the rest of the world, Europe included.The murder of Prime Minister Olof Palme in 1996 shook the whole nation as a trauma. \"This could not\u2014would not\u2014happen here!\"And still it did, and the trauma was repeated when the Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Anna Lindh, was killed last year. Crisis interventions, thus, have had a slow but rising market, and attract considerably more interest today than only a few years ago. Swedish legislation has now demanded a crisis intervention plan by all organizations (AFS 1999:7) Visavi intervened in 9/11 for a Swedish customer, and with the joint efforts of our global partners, we had a counselor on site in Manhattan within 24 hours. There have been a number of international interventions after that,including interventions in Italy and Australia. EAPS IN NORWAY 'The market in Norway had its boom with the findings of oil in the North Sea. The former fishing and farming industry suddenly roared with a new economy, based on the oil platforms.This soon created a need for security procedures, and with it measures were taken to provide interventions based on workplace stress crisis interventions and emergency plans in case of catastrophe. The Norwegian way of building these interventions was very efficient for the oil platforms, and many of the HR ideas and procedures came along with the international oil companies that were based in Norway. But EAPs as a general idea have taken much longer to get established in the thinking of Norwegian organizations. 189 As far as we know there currently is no national provider in Norway \u2014that is, there is no provider that is Norwegian based and run and that includes telephone counselling, face to face counselling and coverage of both psychosociai issues and life management issues.Visavi is covering about a thousand people, mostly in the Oslo area. In the near future,Visavi will create a Norwegian based support centre. SAPS IN DENMARK NMC is the biggest local provider, with emphasis on the public sector.Visavi is providing as a subcontractor to ICAS for the employees of very big American, UK and other international customers. Its activities are mainly in the Copenhagen area, EAPS IN FINLAND Finland's economy 'ryas rueri steadily, and features some big global industries such as Nokia and Outukumpu.The market for EAPs in Finland is yet to be explored.There are no providers except Visavi,to our current knowledge (see criteria for EAP provider as stated above.) Visavi is operating in the private sector,and mainly in the Helsinki area. CONCLUSION The Nordic area is a growing market for EAPs.The -need in organizational life is more and more recognized, and the initial fear and suspicion of something new and innovative has given way to trust and recognition. As an increase occurs in the knowledge and consciousness of what an EAP is and how it works within the organization, the demands will surely rise. The quality of the services will be essential and the credibility of the provider is key in each and every step of the structure of the services. More research is needed to objectively describe the impact of an EAP on the wealth and growth of the organizations, as well as secondary effects. told an American colleague, now living in England, that Visavi is providing to all categories of employees in the Swedish Prisons. She replied: \"Aha! So in a few years time, Sweden will notice a decline in crime rates!\" And yes, why not? If employees have the opportunities provided by an EAP, and use them in a sophisticated way,then that will have an impact on the services they deliver, and good spirals wilt be created. In the globalization of our work life, many connections will reach out over borders. Communication on many levels (social and culturaq will be necessary, and the understanding of each other essential.The building of bridges between cultures, , languages, and customs wild move on.The worldwide nature of work will surely only grow more and more. 190 RESOURCES Swedish Institute Alna Riks Svenska Institutet Box 7434, SE 103 91 Stockholm 08 754 00 ' Forskning och Utveckling AB 116 33 Stockholm Bellmansgatan 5 08 S06 088 00 SE 118 24 Stockholm Visavi AB ICAS Ltd Bondegatan 21 Michael Reddy 116 33 Stockholm Radlett House, West Hill 08 506 088 50 Aspley Guise, Milton Keynes info@visavi.com MK 17 8DT - United Kingdom 2852 00 NMC Kaserntorget 5 411 18 Goteborg 50 www.nmc.nu 630745 NMC-Nordic ''; +45 70 101 102 REFERENCES Fact Sheet, Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, no.2,January 2003.

Although rather small with a population of 7 million on 41,300 square kilometers, it is a focal point of Europe, It brings together four major languages\u2014 German, French, Italian and Raetho Romanic,of which the first three are official Swiss languages (IMES Swiss Federal Office of Immigration, Integration and Emigration, CH-3003 Bern-Wabern, 2003). Switzerland is one of the wealthiest countries in the world due to 150 years of peace, and thanks to its technical know-how, :..: ,. enterprisinn spirit; h~r~! ~Mr~l~ of the economy are metal-working, machines and equipment, watches and clocks, chemicals, food and semi-luxury products, construction industry and the service industry sector (insurance, banks, solutions and organizational tasks for construction and installations). Banking, commerce, and tourism all support the economy and stimulate employment (IMES). The education system is designed to train professionals.The upemployment rate has been increasing in the last few years and is moving between a percentage of 3 and 4.The Swiss are well-educated and have a literacy rate of 99% reading at or above eighth grade level by the age of 75. After the optional nursery school, children enter the compulsory period of schooling.After this follows either vocational training combined with practical work, or attendance at a higher secondary school. The grammar schools prepare students for university entrance. Switzerland has eight universities, as well as a College of Economics, Business and Public Administration in St. Gall and Federal Institutes of Technology in Zurich and Lausanne (IMES). Switzerland has had a long and rich tradition of internal and external occupational social work services since 1922. Therefore EAP services as such are rare,and mostly present in international US-based companies. DESCRIPTION OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM Switzerland has one of the highest life expectancy rates in the world.The country incorporates a private health care system. Since 1996, health care insurance (basic insurance) for illness and accidents has been mandatory for all persons resident in Switzerland. Basic insurance must be arranged with a health insurance company for every person individually. Additional insurance can be taken out for benefits not covered by the basic insurance.The most popular additional insurances cover hospital treatment outside the residence area, or meet the cost of treatment in private hospitals (IMES 2003). Public hospitals have categories designated \"private; \"'semi private,\"and \"basic,\"distinctions based on the number of people in the same room and the treatment by the medical superintendent.The quality of care is the same for all three options. Similarly, each 192 insurance plan grants individuals the opportunity to select their own physicians, and covers the cost of office visits and prescription medication or physical and psychotherapeutic treatments. There is a great deal of public funding in the health care system. Individuals pay one fee to health insurance providers who, in turn, cover the cost of care. However, the cost of care is still much higher than the amount providers pay and the difference is covered by the state. An alternative to increasing health costs is the Health Maintenance Option (HMO), which appeared on the market in the late 1990s. Until 2003, this system did not expand as much as expected, because the majority of Swiss are concerned with the quality of care and pursue free-choice health care options. Despite the skepticism about HMOs, Switzerland is faced with an increasing federal deficit and the growing realization that private health care will not be affordable in future decades. According to a report on contagious diseases from the Federal Office of Public Health, AIDS has had the greatest social effect on Switzerland by far. The country leads Europe with a rate of over 28 cases per 100,000 inhabitants (UNAIDS, epidemiological Fact Sheets in HIV/A~DS,2002 Update). Technological development, work organization and job content have also affected work and health.They have been found to cause increasing mental stress as they allow little opportunity for initiative and decision -making while taking control of the work situation away from the worker (Weiss,1993). Mental stress leads to such health problems as psychosomatic complaints, depression and exhaustion, sleeplessness, and more frequent periods of sick leave. Indirect damage to health also appears in greater consumption of alcohol, sleeping pills and tranquilizers, and cigarettes (Weiss, 1993). A growing degenerative disease rate, combined with work-related accidents, occupational diseases and mental stress, have led to legislation requiring all Swiss inhabitants to have health care. A research study, initiated by the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic AfFairs (Seto), made evident that 82% of the workforce feels distressed.12.1 %cannot deal with it, need medical support, and show signs of underperformance on the job.The financial costs are 4.2 billion Swiss franks per year. That is equivalent to 1.2% of the gross domestic product. (Daniel Ramaciotti,Julien Perriard, Seco, 2003). RELEVANT LEGISLATION Parliamentary legislation mandating occupational social work (OSW) support does not exist, nor does Switzerland belong to any international organizations that call for this service. Nevertheless, Swiss companies are obliged by several federal laws to take care of the safety and health of their employees. Even though Switzerland does not belong to the European Community (EC), Swiss OSWs are members of ENOS (European Network of Occupational Social Work). 193 Laws outlining professional conduct create an umbrella of protection for the employee from company harm and damage. Not connected with this legislation but equally important,according to Hufschmid, is the code of practice laid down by the Swiss Association of Social Workers (SBS-ASPAS).These ethical guidelines specify professional discretion, confidentiality, free service to employees of all levels, and respect for a client's right toself-determination. STATUS OF OCCUPATIONAL SOCIAL WORK (OSW) Historical literature relevant to OSWs in Switzerland is scarce because there has been little academic research about OSW in Switzerland. A small number of academic studies were edited by schools of social work, Two interesting studies have been done on behalf of Movis AG, the first and largest Swiss provider of external OSW: Costs and Benefits in OSW (Edgar Baumgartner, 2004), and OSW in the Change (Edgar Baumgartner and Verena Hufschmid, 2000). Both studies have been published by the college for advanced technical, economic and social studies HFSO, Solothurn Nordwestschweiz. Occupational Social Work in Switzerland is connected with anon-profit organization, which established the first occupational social work office in 1922 at started with external counselors because the social worker should be neutral, At that time, the political tension between workers and employers was very strong. Unemployment stood at 10 per cent, and real income had lost 30 per cent of its value.The number of SV-group advisory boards was increasing very slowly, to 18 boards in 1945 for 74 companies, with 19 social workers. In 1942, SV-group ran the first advisory board for a group of small and medium sized companies. Later, in-house advisory boards were also established, according to Verona Hufschmid, and most of them had originally been organized by SV-group as out-of-the-house advisory boards. In 1999, the OSW-department of SV-group became independent by the foundation of Movis AG,a stock company. In 1944, factory social workers united to become the Swiss Association, which since 1961 has been called the Swiss Professional Association of Occupational Social Workers (SAOSW). In the 1970s,they merged with the Swiss Association of Social Workers (SBS-ASPAS). The field has. moved from micro-level to macro-level as individual employee needs have given way to a systems orientation (Googins et a1.1986).The field also has moved from material, intrinsic, concerns to more psychological and relationship problems. Patterns of practice have also moved from a peripheral role to an integrated component within the organization, meaning that OSW functions support the needs, goals, and values of the workplace. Switzerland practices OSW, but suffers from a slow growth process that inhibits formalization.The former group of Occupational Social Workers inthe SBS-ASPAS generated guidelines for occupational social work. EAP is not rooted in the tradition of social work in Switzerland,so there are only a few US or UK based EAP companies practicing mainly for Swiss plants of international companies. 194 The Swiss consider OSW services a specialty within general social work that operates under the same aims and principles. Its primary function, however, is to assist working people with problems arising in the work environment or straining job performance.Options include OSW vendors as well as on-site services. This is quite similar to France and the Netherlands, whereas many other European countries prefer internal staff for OSW. Generally, large corporations (such as Nestle, The Union Bank of Switzerland, Swisscom, and the Post) utilize an in-house provider. Vendors, on the other hand, usually service smaller companies (from 100 to 5000 employees, with an average of 765). Movis AG is the largest vendor in Switzerland. As of 2003, it had 85 contracts, 20 offices, and 30 social workers. The service is responsible for assigning and educating social workers, adapting the counselling services to actual needs, and design- ing new counselling programs for individuals, teams or groups.The director since 2002 is Dr. Raphael Laubscher, an econ- omistand counselor. EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND OF SWISS OCCUPATIONAL SOCIAL WORKERS Most OSW are Social Workers, and a few are psychologists or nurses. in the French part of Switzerland, health care services are offering OSW counselling more often than in the German or Italian part. A great number of OSW have supplementary clinical formation. SERVICES PERFORMED Occupational social work lends aid and assistance based on methodical standards and professional ethics. Support is offered to people of all working levels within a company.OSW services provide unlimited counselling in personal and family problems, relationship issues, physical health, mental health, addictive behavior, legal complications, social assurance problems of accidents and invalidity, and issues in the workplace pertaining to tasks and staff members.The critical factors for providing these services involve the nature of employees, the culture of the company, and the capability of the OSW. Drug and alcohol problems are also present. Some companies have prevention programs that include seminars and workshops. Furthermore, OSW are involved in preparation for retirement, training workshops concerning prevention of stress, bullying and sexual harassment, social training for trainees, and others. Here, the social worker may organize programs or deliver clinical support to employees with those specific issues. Hufschmid also believes .that sexual harassment at work is an increasing concern. Many companies have requested training workshops and have developed support groups for this issue. In 1997, the federal law against discrimination based on gender and against sexual harassment was established. Since then, every company has had to establish an advisory funcfiion for employees who were concerned about discrimination or are victims of sexual harassment. Most of the Movis-counselors are members of these special advisory teams. 195 General services offered by OSW vendors vary slightly from those offered by an in-house OSW.The difference between the two lies in the role of the OSW, but not the issues. An out-of-house OSW has a neutral position towards employee and employer; he/she has a mediating or negotiating role. The decision about the treatment of more private/personal or work-oriented problems by the OSW does not depend on his/her position. External as well as internal OSW are working in four areas, First, it is the OSW's responsibility to provide counselling for ail levels of company employees who seek advice.This involves issues. not directly related to the workplace, such as personal or family problems, or problems which might manifest themselves in the workplace.The OSW may also deal with mental health issues and substance abuse addictions. Proactive approaches recognize these problems as early as possible, and refer employees to external agencies specializing in the problem area where more intensive treatment is possible. Secondly,.an OSW renders practical assistance to employees regarding the workplace. For example,an OSW might address on-the-job issues, Also included in this category are communication problems between individual employees and between. employees and management /supervisors, Practical assistance may also involve dealing with employee health problems, which may have resulted from the workplace environment. Thirdly,the OSW reacts to employee problems that arise from the work environment. Employees experiencing downsizing or restructuring within an organization may call on a social worker for assistance. An OSW program lends support during a time of extensive lay-offs or factory closure, and counselors advise employees, for social security and early or general retirement planning. The final category of service that a typical OSW vendor provides is training. Social workers must inform and promote their services at the workplace.To do this, they deliver training workshops to employees on current topics and provide updates on services.To the executives of a company, social workers offer training programs that address problems in the company and teach the skills to aid executives in handling employee grievances. In addition to training, OSW vendors are urged to provide experience opportunities for social work students by.creating internships. It is also the duty of Sows to educate themselves on new methods of practice and current social work matters. This also facilitates awareness of present and future social problems. Whether part of an in-house program or an external vendor, industrial social workers are seen as a component of the contracting company.,On -site counselors literally occupy staff positions within the organization because confidentiality issues exempt the worker from normal channels of communication within the company. Formally, counselors report to the personnel manager, but they are professionally responsible for themselves.They do not III a managerial function, except within their own department, but are often called upon to advise personnel on specific matters. 196 FINANCING In. the case of Movis, contracting companies pay all fees directly to the vendor agency. Information regarding the application of utilization rates as a factor for pricing was not disclosed, but Movis did share that their utilization rate varied between 39'o and 8 %, with an average rate of 3.84% in 2003; some companies had a higher rate due to the nature of the organization. Service delivery is set-up in a long-term perspective. Contracts are lengthy, lasting from 30 to more than 80 years in some cases. Generally,there is no limitation in the number of sessions orthe time used for quests and administration for a single client. While the US utilizes models with a specified number of sessions,'the Swiss do not limit the number of sessions available; and therefore require a different mode of pricing,especiall.y for long-term treatment. Companies have the option of paying per case or for a certain amount of time. Fees are also incurred for company training and workshops, and an overhead charge is added to cover the cost of office and administrative support. OCCUPATIONAL SOCIAL WORK AND EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN SWITZERLAND As OSW became rooted in Switzerland after WWI, practices developed which placed counselors' offices in the workplace, The early functions of the OSW included primarily supplying practical help, as the salaries were very low, and there was no social security.OSWs supplied cheap clothing they organized courses for cooking on a law budget they planned holidays for workers' children in the mountains, and so on. With economic development and changes in the working world, new problems arose and the social worker's position in the company turned to counselling rather than providing practical help. What Americans term Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) began to grow partially from Swiss personnel departments. In public institutions (as Post, railway) individuals often received training in OSW while employed, and upon completion would move into a personnel or managerial role (Googins et al., 1986). Until the 1990s, many companies grew to value social work training as preparation for employee management and favored the employment of those with specialized education (Googins et. AI.,1986); OSW is also providing coaching for supervisors and human resources managers in relation to difficult social issues and crisis intervention. Hufschmid explains that OSW services are very similar to certain EAP services. Swiss OSWs consistently maintain long-term contracts (30 to 80 years as mentioned eariier).This is typical in Swiss culture.There are only a few EAP\u2014Services, established by international companies who prefer to have one single provider for all their plants worldwide. The Swiss fear that converting to a traditional EAP format might inadvertently limit the scope of a broader, more fully developed approach to OSW (Googins et.Al.,1986),Individual\u2014 oriented help is only one aspect of workplace social services, and a small part of a much larger OSW plan which entails activities throughout the life of a company (Googins et a1.,1986). CURRENT ISSUES OF OSW IN SWITZERLAND A general inquiry at 30 internal and external Swiss OSWs from April 2004 showed a broad range of main issues: problems at the workplace (structural changes, increasing performance demands, conflicts), mental and physical health questions including drug and alcohol addiction, personal and family problems, and financial problems. A part of OSW focuses on preventive activities such as addlctfon prevention programs and preparation for retirement. Only a minority of social workers are performing team counselling. The current trends are multifarious. Mandates for individual or team coaching, training for health promotion and sexual harassment prevention are increasing. Specific .individual issues are increasing, such as personal and family problems, problems at the workplace (stress because of dismissals and reorganizations), integration and identity, reintegration at the workplace after grave or long-lasting illness, and financial problems. Generally, clients do not like to leave the workplace for a counselling session.They prefer coming during their spare time. .Current developments in the economic environment are challenging both the workforce and the social services. The uncertainty of the development of companies or departments, and the increasing performance demand are impressive. As a consequence of reorganizations ormergers, contact with the human resources managers becomes more difficult,and personal meetings occur less often.As a good personal relationship between Human Resources or supervisors and OSW is critical to the success of OSW services, this is a growing challenge. As Lau-Villinger points out, the function and position of the OSWer within the company, and especially within the Human Resources Department, is crucial for the very existence, influence and success of OSW (Lau-Villinger 1994), CONCLUSION In Switzerland, OSW services nowadays are internal in most cases, though the initiative for OSW was started by an external provider in 1922.In the last few years, some internal services of big companies evaluated an outsourcing of the OSW.It is evident that companies are hesitating to change to external models when an in-house service is well established. Swiss OSW practitioners can be compared to EAP, especially as some are outside vendors. 198 RESOURCES AND EAP PROVIDERS EAP Patrick Coidan, Director.

Several government initiatives are targeting key issues including, but not limited to, drug and substance abuse, EQ and mental health in the workplace,The year 2003 was promoted as the year of Accident Decrease. With regard to mental health in the workplace, the government's objectives are to increase health and safety while decreasing levels of stress amongst the employee population,This shnuldcontribute to enhanced well being and greater productivity of the workforce. STATUS OF SAPS EAP-like programs are rather, novel in Thailand. Although some companies have established programs aimed at reducing stress and increasing employees'well being there is a lack of policies, legislation education, promotion and training when it comes to mental health related programs. The Department of Mental Health sponsored two EAP conferences in June 2001 and in July 2002.The objectives of these conferences were: To further the understanding of mental health and drug addiction in workplaces. To provide a platform of information and discussion between the public and the private sector. To encourage cooperation between the public and private sector regarding mental health issues in the workplace. To develop recommendations for the government on how to best support the promotion of mental health related pro- grams,including legislation guidelines fnrprofessionals and incentives for employers who establish EAP-like programs. The Department of Mental Health (DMH) of the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) and the Bureau of Labor Protection of the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare (MOLSW) have agreed to cooperate with the Asia Pacific Employee Assisxance Roundtable (APEAR) for the 2004 conference in Bangkok. RELATED PROJECTS AND INITIATIVES WHITE FACTORY In 1996, the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare (MLSW) introduced a program called the \"White Factory. \"This program requires employers with over 200 employees at a 'site to set up a committee, provide information for employees, and conduct random drug testing for methamphetamines,The policy states that those who test positive should be helped. (Note: the current section on safety and health within the Labor Protection Act will be replaced by an independent Acton Occupational Health and Safety.) 201 SMILE AT WORK The Department of Mental Health (DMH) has developed a \"Smile at Work\" kit for supervisors with over 10 staff. The kit represents aself-learning package and comprises a variety of materials: Handbook Learning how to smile at work by yourself Amphetamine prevention at work Brochure EQ and job satisfaction Relaxation Counseling techniques for supervisor Happiness promotion Tape Practicing relaxation CD EQ and job satisfaction Relaxation Practicing relaxation Counseling techniques for supervisors Happiness promotion In July 2003, the Department of Mental Health trained a group of 200 supervisors on how to use the kit in order to promote well being among their team members in the workplace. In close cooperation with the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, the kit will be rolled out in several provinces throughout the year 2004. TO BE NUMBER ONE In 2002, the Princess Ubonrat took on the patronage of a project called \"To Be Number One:'This project targets young students and employees and aims at primary prevention of drug and substance abuse. Several topics are currently being worked on by the DMH experts: The development of guidelines for psychosocial care in the workplace The development of psychosocial care in community hospitals The development of standards for the treatment of patients suffering from co-morbidity of mental diseases and substance abuse/addiction. 202 EQ Another area of expertise within the DMH is Emotional Intelligence. Experts within the DMH have developed a range of educational and promotional materials to increase the awareness and recognition of the importance of EQ for mental health and well being. Training and train-the-trainer workshops for private companies are being provided upon request. SOLVE. SOLVE is an interactive educational program designed to assist in the development of policy and action to address psychosocial issues at the workplace. It focuses on prevention. In June 2003, the MOLSW started a project of cooperation with the ILO to address the psychosocial issues that affect Thai employees. SOLVE in Thailand spans a comprehensive network of government agencies, such as the Department of Mental Health, the Department of Health Promotion and Services, the Department of Medical Services, the Office of Social Insurance and the Office of the Narcotics Control ~~'.: will gradualiq be implemented throughout Thailand. Thefirst batch of SOLVE Course ~, >><:cc~ ~ ~~:,s trained in July 2003, and the program is supposed to be rolled out throughout the year 2004. MOU BETWEEN THE MOPH AND MOLSW In order to further promote. mental health and well being in the workplace, the two Ministries signed a Memorandum of Understanding in September 2003. Both Ministries recognize the importance of multi-disciplinary cooperation to enhance current practices and standards of health prevention, promotion, treatment and recovery programs. Programs like SOLVE are prime examples of cooperation between the two Ministries. At present, the Thailand market is shared by approximately six providers working in a variety of settings: New Community Services (NCS): founded in 2002 by several European counselors who used to work with CSB (Community Services of Bangkok). Operates as a non-for profit organization. The team members are missionaries with training in counseling on various Ievels.They are associated with a Thai psychiatrist and cater to both the Thai and non-Thai community. Personal Dynamics Co., Ltd.: founded in 2000 by Dominique Norz, Dipl.-Psych. Personal Dynamics is a consulting firm designed to meet the demand for professional consulting services within both the expatriate and corporate community in Thailand. Having chosen \"Linking people and solutions\" as its motto, Personal Dynamics provides psychological assistance as well as training and education programs to maximize individual well being and corporate productivity. Psychological Services International (PSI): founded in 2002 by two American counselors .who used to work with CSB (Community Services of Bangkok). PSI operates as anot-for-profit organization and employs several American 203 counselors with various levels of degrees and experience. Their main activity focuses on the delivery of counseling services to the expatriate community in Bangkok Saisilp Centre: the Centre for Creative Growth and Professional Training was founded in 2002 by a Thai professional licensed in the US as LMFT (Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist) and LMHC (Licensed Mental Health Counsellor). Saisilp Centre is a private organization that provides counseling services and group activities to promote self-development and exploration of life issues for both children and adults, Thammasat University: two professors with degrees in psychology are delivering EAP services and corporate training to Thai and multinational companies in the Greater Bangkok area. Human Dynamic: has its headquarters in Hong Kong and is working in affiliation with several of the above mentioned groups to provide EAP services to multinational corporations in the Greater Bangkok area.They are using a 1-800 number for employees to contact aThai-speaking counselor in Singapore. Government initiatives and projects are addressing the issue of mental health and well being at the workplace on various levels. Programs like EAP, SOLVE or White Factory, to name just a few, can contribute to making a difference. It will be of critical importance to research the impact and outcomes of these programs to prove their benefits. In addition to that milestones in the process include ongoing training for supervisors and HR personnel continued education for mental health professionals, and the development of guidelines and a code of conduct within a legal framework, Lastly,the disparity between physical and mental health needs to be addressed in amulti- disciplinary approach aimed at de-stigmatizing mental health ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN TRIMDAD AND TOBAGO BY PATRICIA ELDER BACKGROUND in 2000 the state of EAP work in Trinidad and Tobago was documented in the 2nd edition of the International Employee Assistance Anthology describing its evolution from a focus on the treatment of alcoholism to the growing influence of foreign corporations' demands for EAP services for its employees. In 2004, the work of the EAP provider and indeed the entire social services and mental health system have come under growing pressure as the demand steadily increases for focused, specific. responses to personal, work-related, social and ...traumatic issues. On a daily basis, the media elucidates the social stresses and. stains this young nat~nn is Pxrerie~ ^~.inc~ -These issues demand attention on the micro, individual level, and are directly related to the macro, nation-wide, social (and in some cases, organizational change) issues. Needless to say, the workplace and its employees' level of performance and productivity are affected. There are many serious, social issues today that infiltrate the workplace. They include the issues within our educational system, which are affected by and affect our family and community life. Other issues include the burgeoning number of children displaying conduct disorders, oppositional and even antisocial behaviors in the school environment.The dehate and subsequent decision by educators to ban corporal punishment in schools has been linked by some schools of thought to the increase in violence in schools. Meanwhile the public display and action taken by some educators as they demand better working conditions and remuneration packages is sadly juxtaposed by the grim observation that increasing numbers of students do not have a command of formal English language upon leaving school. That points to a worrying trend of illiteracy in some areas. Parents face many difficulties as they seek to provide values and principles that may run counter to those the child experiences outside of the family and home,Some contributing factors include:the influence of the media the proliferation of access to the Internet; exposure to foreign television shows and movies which show different, confrontational, communication styles and different relationships to elders and authority figures along with different parenting styles. The debate over corporal punishment in schools continues as adults seek ways to control their children's behavior. The need for parents to work outside the home leaves some children without the benefit of relating to adults who can nurture them while providing discipline and guidance on a consistent basis. Thus children are neglected or become recipients of various forms of abuse or may run away or act out accordingly. Parents who are employees bring their concerns for their children's welfare to the workplace.ln the absence of adequate support systems or reliable child-care services available to them, many parents demand time off to take care of their children. 205 The rise in crime throughout the region has had a significant impact on the workplace. Persons who are survivors of crimes are usually traumatized and often need time off from work or some sort of accommodation as they return to the workplace. Employers may have to provide support for the employee, their coworkers, and in some cases even the family members as they attempt to cope with the recovery from a traumatic event.Too often trauma occurs in the workplace with violent acts being executed in front of other workers, thus traumatizing an entire workforce. As crime escalates it is not unusual to either be a survivor of an incident or to know someone who is a victim.The effects on productivity are obvious. Substance abuse continues to be a major issue, with the usual denial of problems, and continues to affect personal and professional lives. Although, as was noted in the previous article, treatment facilities are available here, they may not meet the needs of the organization at apolicy- making level. In response, some organizations have therefore been implementing substance abuse policies and procedures to guide managers as to how to deal with the employee who ha$ displayed work related problems possibly due to substance abuse. However, many companies still do not have a written. policy t~ deal with this pervasive problem.The EAP service provider is called upon to assist and provide guidance in the design stage of the policy making process. The influence of information technology has been atwo=edged sword. The positive impact is obvious: greater access to information, educational opportunities, and chances to enhance oneself personally and professionally.On the other hand, Internet access to information of a mature nature has raised another issue for media management. The problem involves the downloading of pornographic material and the distribution of such materials in the workplace., in the community, and even among our children. Some organizations ask the EAP provider for assistance in designing an \"Internet Policy\" to provide a structure for dealing with this relatively new issue in the workplace. The debate around human sexuality, adolescent pregnancy and abortion is current, intense and colorful. The religious groups in many of our communities are strong in-their stance while some other groups view the laws of the country as archaic and in need of amendment.These groups argue that poor women do not have equal access to quality medical care, while the more financially secure women are likely to obtain a medically safe procedure given their financial advantage. The debate continues while women continue to make their decisions based on need and ability to pay and in many cases place their lives in danger.To the employer, employees who do not receive quality medical care become a burden on the health care system as these employees can face complications, disability or death. Employers seek to respond to the current needs of their workers with sensitivity and compassion.The EAP provider's role is to provide direct counselling and referral services to women who present with this issue, to assist the community of employees in receiving accurate information with which they can make educated decisions about their reproductive health, and to provide consultation to the organizations as they respond to these events. Issues described in the previous edition of this work remain and in some cases have been exacerbated. For example, there has been a marked increase in the frequency of reported acts of aggression against members of the 206 community at almost all socioeconomic levels, All members of he population seem to be at risk of becoming another crime statistic. Many in the workplace voice fears about personal safety. How companies deal with traumatic events in and out of the workplace has become a primary topic of conversation in many circles.The EAP Provider's knowledge of critical Incidents and trauma work is now essential to any practice.Their availability when called upon to do this work is critical. STATUS OF EAPS From the above you may see that the EAP providers and indeed the entire social service and mental health system have their hands full, The social changes, both positive and negative, in our communities have come to the doorstep of the employer and employers' need for support and guidance is significant. What is progressive is that more and more employers are turning to professional mental health service providers and EAP providers for help in handling employees' personal, social and work related problems. Even the governmental agencies are increasingly recognizing the value of this support service-.They have take n a ,ignificant step. in the institutionalization of EAPs in every part of the public service; the gu.~~ being that every employee of the government would have access to an EAP service. This is noteworthy. Thousands of employees and their family members will be affected by the implementation of a nationwide public service EAP. In the private sector, companies of every size and geographical location, but especially those with foreign connections, are increasingly demanding comprehensive EAP services.They request not only the core services but also other supplementary, adjunctive services.These include wellness activities ,organizational development,trauma work,and consultation services. Preya!ent issues presented to the EAP counselor include: Managing children's' behavior Parenting Critical incidents and traumatic events Fear of becoming a victim of crime Increased economic wealth\u2014money management Materialism and its effect on child rearing and relationships Intrusion of outside globalization attitudes and behaviors\u2014 changing mores values and ethics as they relate to human sexuality Change in work ethic\u2014growing sense of entitlement Education and self-improvement and its effect on relationships Rising youth subculture with different life perspectives Influence of non-national workers and expatriates on the workplace Expansion of businesses regionally and internationally tyith attendant need to develop and grow professionally or be left out or left behind. Impact on the working population of HIV/AIDS pandemic with the Caribbean being a leader in the western hemisphere in numbers of cases. Struggle to stay healthy and ~t physically and avoid stress related illnesses. 207 Fortunately, practitioners in the social services and mental health field are present in increasing numbers since there is recognition by the educational institutions that society needs professionals trained to provide services in the communities.To supply adequately trained persons for this growing professional group, tertiary-level programs are being offered by the university system in Counselling and Human Resource Management,Early Childhood Education,Geriatric Care, Psychiatric Nursing, and other fields. As previously described in 2000, the health care system in our country is under significant pressure. The demand for increased,.quality, state-of-the-art, EAP, mental health and other support services is significant. Both the private and public sectors are aware and are putting in place infrastructure to accommodate the growing service demands of the citizenry. However, this is a very slow process. In the meantime, the demands continue to strain the system.The EAP practitioners in collaboration with their social service and other mental health professionals must network, collaborate and work together to provide the best services and best practice to our clients. In conclusion, the work of the EAP is expanding as the movement from alcoholism treatment to organizational development, wellness, and worWlife services predominates. Most significant for the mental health and EAP professional is the rise in the number of critical incidents, traumatic events, and catastrophic illnesses occurring in our communities and, by extension; the workplace. While employees continue to seek assistance for their relationship issues and marital problems, employees and organizations also now call for assistance with critical incident stress debriefing sessions, crisis management and intervention, and consultation_ on policy making on the variety of social issues that affect the workplace, The EAP practitioner needs to be increasingly knowledgeable of social trends in our communities and their impact on the workplace in addition to a familiarity with organizational change issues in a growing, vibrant economy. It is therefore incumbent upon all who are part of this service industry to collaborate with our colleagues to provide the best, quality professional services to our clients in a consistent manner. 208 RESOURCES AND EAP PROVIDERS SERVICE COMPANY/ CONTACT NAME TELEPHONE FAX/EMAIL ORGANIZATION &ADDRESS (CODE 866) HIV/AIDS Community Action Resource (CARE) 41 New Sfi.

Guilds (trade associations in medieval times) have flourished throughout Europe for many centuries.They were the medieval equivalent of Government Departments controlling weights and measure, imports and the wages and training of apprentices.7he National Health Service was established in 1948 to provide free health care and medical treatment on demand. However, it is overburdened by the needs of the population, so private health, companies and voluntary organizations have been created to help fulfill the demand. Many companies provide private heath insurance to their staff. The Health and Personal Social Services Statistics publication' available from the Department of Health provides high level summary information on a wide range of health and social care in England. It covers the nation's health, health care (primary,communityand hospitals), personal social services,workforce, and the level of Department of Health expenditure. Contact names, email addresses and telephone numbers are provided, together with a full list of statistical publications produced by the Department of Health. People living in England and Wales in deprived industrial areas are more likely to be treated for depression than people living in any other type of area'.Over the period,1994 -1998, 34 per 1,000 male patients and 77 per 1,000 female. patients in deprived industrial areas were treated for depression, compared with rates of 21 and 55 respectively in suburban areas. The gender variation is very evident in all types of areas, and in England and Wales overall the rate for females was two and a half times that for males. The Governments NHS Plan for England, published in July 2000, also emphasized the importance of mental health. Despite the fact that more men commit suicide than women, men's mental health in general is much better;. The Psychiatric Morbidity Survey' of adults living in private households carried out in Great Britain by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) measured a range of mental disorders and symptoms. Of these, the most common were neurotic disorders, such as anxiety, depression and phobias. In~2000, 135 men per 1,000 were assessed as having some kind of neurotic disorder; for women the rate was much higher, at 194 per 1,000. In particular, men had significantly lower rates of phobias and mixed anxiety and depressive disorder: 68 men per 1,000 were diagnosed with this illness while the rate for women was much higher, at 108 per 1,000.Treatment by aGeneral Practitioner (Family Doctor) for depression has risen over the last few years, particularly among younger men, perhaps indicating growing awareness and acceptance of mental illness.According to the General Practice Research Databases almost 16 men (aged between 16 and 24) per 1,000 patients were treated for depression in 1998 in England and Wales, almost double the rate in 1994. 211 Employers in the UK have a duty of care towards their employees. A recent Court of Appeal (Sutherland v Hatton 2002) rulingb clarified the legal position for employers with regard to stress related claims. It emphasized that employees who recognize they are having a problem with stress have a responsibility to inform their employer. Moreover, on a practical level, an employer who offers a confidential advice service, including counselling or treatment services, is unlikely to be found in breach of duty unless it has been placing unreasonable demands on an individual where the risk of psychiatric injury was clear. In May 2004, the Health &Safety executive published new consultative standards for employers dealing with stress in the workplace'.The Standard revolves around what the HSE has isolated as six potential stressors; demands of the job, employees' control over how they work, support from management and colleagues, workplace relationships, clarity of role, and organizational change. Organizations can achieve the Standard if 85% of employees say they can handle the demands of theirjob, are able to influence the way they work, and gain support from managers.Twa- thirds must give a positive response to the final three stressors. Figures from the Department of Work and Pensions (Labour Market trends 2001)8 show 7.1 million disabled people are of working age.They represent 19% of the working population but only 50% of them are in employment compared to 87% of non-disabled people. By 2010 it is forecast that 40% of the UK's population will be aged 45 or over, the age at which disability begins to increase significantly, With an aging population and high recruitment costs it is becoming more cost effective to keep staff with disabilities in their jobs. It can be difficult for an employer to make the adjustments necessary and support the employee at the same time. EAPs in UK are an important early intervention for people in employment whose jobs maybe injeopardy due to their level of stress or mental health, particularly when the EAP is integrated with job retention services. These are focused vocational rehabilitation services delivered through specialist- dedicated case-managers.The aim is a one-stop resource for employers, not only focussing on job retention but also concentrating on all the interventions necessary to create healthy work environments. These include organizational stress audits, specialist case management, workplace counselling, mental health awareness training, collaborative working partnerships and work support groups. ProfessorJennie Secker at King's College, London is currently carrying out research on the effectiveness of these interventions. STarus of EAPs The first EAP program was introduced to UK when Control Data, an American company, began providing assistance to their employees from their internal EAP in the States. This became a UK-based internal service in 1981.The first external EAPs were founded in the mid 1980s. There are now 15 companies providing services that are registered with the local EAPA chapter.These providers have signed up to the UK EAPA Standards of practice and professional guidelines and have completed aself-certificated audit of provision of service against the guidelines. There are also a number of companies who provide EAPs who are not members of EAPA.AII Registered EAPs should be capable of providing the following: Managerial referrals Short-term counselling: a minimum of assessment and referral plus case management, 212 normally 6-8 sessions of counselling Information and specialist support services, including legal, consumer and debt Referrals for diagnosis, longer term treatment and assistance An Employer would receive an assessment of organizational need and help with Health and Safety policies, absence management, and disability and grievance procedures.This would include: Clear communication of how the EAP will work. Implementation and promotion of the scheme with booklets, cards with contact details, training sessions for managers, and information sessions for employees. Training for managers and supervisors in areas such as change-management, referrals, stress awareness. Feedback on themes and trends within the workplace. Audit and evaluation: An employer should see evaluation of cost effectiveness, customer satisfaction surveys and quai~y cvntr_o systerns, conipiaint procedures and service level agreements, EAPs should also provide assistance on the main conflicts between the employer and the employee.They include; Harassment and Bullying Grievance procedures Productivity and Absence Management Disability management Childcare and Eldercare Stress management COUNSELORS /PSYCHOTHERAPISTS Staff working as therapists for Registered EAPs as either case managers or as affiliates in private practice should be able to show they: Are a qualified counselor /psychotherapist to ideally at least diploma level, and able to produce copies of these qualifications to confirm this. Are accredited or eligible for accreditation by BACP or an equivalent nationally recognized counselling/ psychotherapy organization and a subscriber to the relevant codes of ethics and practice. Have completed at least 450 hours of supervised generic counselling /psychotherapy practice. Have undertaken specific training (supported by documentation where possible) and/or have experience of working within ashort-term model of counselling /psychotherapy, orhave already worked satisfactorily as an EAR Case Manager or Affiliate. Are able to demonstrate that they are committed to their own ongoing professional and personal development as acounselor /therapist. Have professional counselling /psychotherapy supervision arrangement of at least one and a half hours per month.This will need to be confirmed by the supervisor as part of their reference. 213 RESOURCES AND EAP PROVIDERS AXA PPP Healthcare Phillips House Crescent House Tunbridge Wells Kent TN 1 k Ceridian Harbour E14 9GE Tel: 0800 733 337 www.ceridiancentrefile.com Studios, Battersea Park 11 4LR, UK Tel:+44 Accor Services SW 1 V West Hill Aspley Guise Milton Keynes MK17 8DT Tei: + 44 (0) 1908 285201 Email: info@icasgroup.com www.icasgroup.com PPC Worldwide 4200 Nash Court John Smith Drive Oxford Business Park South HG2 OJHTeI; 01423 50 www.theoakdalecentre.co.0 k National Health Service Information www.nhs.uk Prevalence of treated depression: by type of area and gender,1994 -1998: Social Trends 31 Prevalence of neurotic disorder: by gender, 2000: Social focus on men 'Lifetime experience of stressful life events by type and gender, 2000: Social Trends 32 5 http://www.statistics .gov.uWCCI /nscl.asp ?ID=6489 6 Sutherland v.

DEBORAH KEARY~, CHRISTINA THOMPSON e~ BARBARA MARSDEN 9, BERNARD MCCANN 10, GEORGE WATKINS \",AND CHARLES WILLIAMS'2 BACKGROUND The employee assistance field has evolved into afull-fledged professional service addressing a myriad of personal and work organizational needs in today's economy: Like the business community in which they exist, Employee Assistance. Programs (EAPs) now find themselves in a period of significant transition.This chapter presents the current status of EAPs from eight different perspectives: overview, program models and funding mechanisms, integration of services, professional ..certification, accreditation, ini~rria~:ir~n~i ~ ~~r.t^k+ :r~;i .s i.,~ _jnd professional development, and research. It concludes with a section describing future trends. Employee assistance efforts began as occupational alcoholism programs staffed by workers who had successfully achieved sobriety.These workplace efforts have evolved into broad brush programs delivered by a variety of practitioners, drawn from a multitude of disciplines: psychologists, social workers, Work/Life professionals, substance abuse specialists, and marriage and family therapists. These professionals help employees and their dependents cope with the full range of mental health ~Ii~ICUItICS~ from diagnosed mental. disorders to the i~~ore typical ~ersonai corxerns regarding rnarita{, parental and family upsets; work stress; financial. and legal issues; substance abuse and WorWLife issues. The growth of managed behavioral health care has led to a revolution in employee assistance efforts. Conceived to combat spiraling medical costs, managed care was envisioned as a method of reducing expenditures while insuring that appropriate levels of care were maintained. Managed behavioral health care often provides near-identical features with EA services and consolidation in the behavioral health and EA fields has lead to the development of integrated EA/managed care products. The emergence of drug-free workplaces in the 1980s as the standard for American industry has been another important factor affecting EAPs. When EAPs utilizing a combination of supportive assistance and disciplinary action to address substance abuse are integrated into a comprehensive drug-free workplace approach, these organizations have enjoyed the greatest success. STATUS OF EAPS At present, the EA industry is going through fundamental changes that reflect the needs of corporate clients. Many contemporary EAPs combine employee assistance assessment, referral .and case management with a broader, WorWLife 216 umbrella approach, These broad brush EAPs, designed to be a one-stop shopping place for mental health needs, have become a core employee benefit in today's workplace.This trend of EA service delivery will likely be continued for the next decade by the more adept EA providers and contribute to additional market consolidation. The current market opportunities for EA products in the United States are in the small and medium sized employer sectors, The majority of Fortune 1000 companies and larger employers have mature programs, some existing for over twenty years. Other best prospects for future market growth include the development of specialty -type markets and expansion into the international arena. Continued pressure on pricing and profits will be difficult to overcome. Efficiency of service delivery, improved product quality, enhanced product development and effective marketing will all be important competitive factors. At this point, effective marketing may be the most crucial factor. CHALLENGES The EA industry is fairly fragmented, with no undisputed industry leader. Cross-industry collaboration in several areas would allow professional associations to combine resources and move the field forward in an efficient and timely manner. Purchasers are increasingly expecting EA providers to deliver value while demonstrating quantifiable returns on their investment. To meet these expectations, EA professional organizations must emphasize accountability through quality improvement, surveys and evaluation efforts. In addition, new technology platforms to enhance EA services are needed. Numerous challenges criiSt JJiihin the behavioral managed care arena. For example, if managed behavioral healthcare firms also provide an EA service component that component suffers from at least the appearance of a conflict of interest, given managed care's focus on limiting treatment costs as well as its profit motive. Further, if managed care incentives emphasize cost containment over appropriate levels of care, conflicting program goals may arise. By contrast, if incentives allow freer access to treatment, commitments to contain costs may suffer, Achieving an equitable balance between employee assistance and managed care functions will allow the two approaches to blend more effectively. OPPORTUNITIES With the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the need for employee assistance programs has never been so clear. The immediate impact of September 11, 2001 on the EA industry was immense.ln the weeks following the attacks,one provider's requests for critical incident debriefings increased 3,000 percent. Another EA provider conducted 41 critical incident stress-debriefing, (CISD) sessions with 24 companies in seven states within one week.The Employee Assistance Professionals Association's (EAPA) switchboard was flooded with media inquiries and requests for referral to EA professionals, grief counselors and CISD providers. EA professionals also will find tremendous opportunities in the area of behavioral risk management, program evaluation, organizational development and human resource and benefit management functions. Many EAPs have begun assuming 217 functions typically associated with managed care in the area of mental health, alcohol and drug abuse. Assigning EA personnel responsibility for behavioral healthcare coverage \"carve outs\" and empowering them to negotiate contracts for clinical services can dramatically reduce costs for organizations, while providing quality mental health services for workers and their dependents. EAPs continue to have greater opportunities to demonstrate their value by helping organizations cope with the increasing stress and complexity of today's workplace, EA personnel will continue to remain the first point of contact for employees and their family members experiencing personal concerns. The current unprecedented demand for EA services is an opportune occasion to firmly position EAPs as an integral part of the new workplace environment, and as the entry point for the system of mental health and substance abuse services. PROGRAM MODELS AND FUNDING MECHANISMS. There is no one way to succinctly describe the various models of EAPs. Instead, there are descriptive terms that have evolved over time that focus on aspects of service design and delivery. Reflecting the wide diversity in types of work organizations that sponsor EA efforts, delivery models of EA services are many and varied. However,there appears to be a practical and functional aspect to distinguishing EAPs along a number of discrete dimensions including: SESSION LIMITATION Assessmenrand Referral Model: Typically offers up to three EAP sessions focused on problem identification and linkage. to an appropriate outside resource for problem improvement or resolution. Short Term Problem Resolution Model: Offers additional sessions beyond the assessment process when it is determined that the assessed problem can be improved or resolved using EA services. When the assessed problem cannot be adequately addressed through additional EAP sessions, the EA professional provides appropriate linkage to outside resources.Typical short-term problem -solving models offer 4 to 8 sessions, which are inclusive of the assessment session(s). RANGE OF SERVICES BasicModel:Offers the core services of a traditional EAP, including consultation to and training of appropriate persons in the identification and resolution of job performance issues, problem assessment, referral and follow-up services, organizational consultation, program promotion and education. Add-on Service Model: Offers a menu of EAP and related services in addition to core EAP services.These might include critical incident response, wellness trainings, work-life services, legal assistance, financial services, etc. 21$ RELATIONSHIP WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES Stand\u2014Alone Model: There is no service relationship between the EAP and the behavioral health services available to beneficiaries. Incegrared Model: The EAP and the behavioral health services available to beneficiaries are purposefully interrelated in apre-defined capacity by the sponsoring organization(s), For example, the EAP may serve as the required gateway to behavioral health services. SERVICE LOCATION On-Site Model: EA services are physically delivered on the property or worksite of the sponsoring organization(s.) Off-Site Model: EA services are delivered at a locatiari other than the workslte or property of the sponsoring organization(s.) Virrua! Model: EAP services are delivered telephonically or online, eliminating the issue of EAP office Iocation.The virtual site has been used extensively for delivering \"add-on\" EAP service such as Work/Life services, health promotions, employee education, organizational training and mental health screenings.On -line delivery of core EAP services is gaining momentum as the industry develops standards and protocols for optimal efficiencies and client protections. Mixed Site Model: A blend of on-site, off-site and virtual sites is made available to the beneficiaries of EAP services. SERVICE PROVIDER Internal Model: Services are provided by staff or members of the sponsoring organization(s). External Model: Services are outsourced to an external EA provider. Mixed/Blended Model. Services are delivered using a customization of both internal and external providers. For example the administrative functions of the EAP could be managed through internal staff while an outside vendor provides assessment services. PeerModeL Trained peers or colleagues, using a social support framework, provide early identification, intervention, and referral to support services for problem resolution. Affiliate Model: A network of contracted behavioral health care providers is available to provide EAP services within a specified distance from home and/or work.This model has become increasingly popular with organizations that need 219 to address equity in EAP service accessibility and delivery due to multiple, dispersed, global and/or alternative work sites. SERVICE ELIGIBILITY Employee Assistance Program: Typically, the model is designed to assist employees of the sponsoring organization(s.) Though not included in the name, family members of employees may often utilize the services.The relationship between the sponsor and the beneficiary of EAP services is not always anemployer- employee construct. The term is sometimes used to describe the universe of EA programs without consideration of the model, Employee and FamilyAssisiance Program: The inclusion of the term \"family\" in the name of the program purposefully highlights the availability of services to family members.The definition of\"family\" may vary by programs and may or~may~not~addressthe issue of\"domest~~_ ~~i~~?.~~ic~~~~\"~.~~~;~:~;~<<~~:-_ MemberAssisranceProgram (MAP): Designed to serve members of the sponsoring organization(s).Again, though not. included in the name, family members may be covered. Labor unions or professional associations, for example, may sponsor MAPS. LaborAssisrance Program (LAP): Designed to assist workers who are members and/or employees of the sponsoring organization. Although there are various models described, the management model is clearly the one most utilized. SPONSOR /PAYER OF SERVICE Management Model: An employer, business or corporation sponsors the EAP as a risk management tool, to reduce liability related to troubled employees. Colleague Model:The sponsoring organization is typically a professional association often acting with or under a level of authority and funding from a state licensing /certifying board.Offering support and rehabilitation to colleagues while simultaneously protecting the public from harm is a primary focus of this model. Consortium Model: in this arrangement,the combined resources of member organizations fund services.Consortia are often constructed of small to medium size organizations seeking quantity. discounts. Joint Labor/ManagemenrModel: Services arejointly funded and managed by labor and management.This model recognizes the collective benefit to both organizations when workers are assisted. 220 Union Model: The sponsoring entity is a labor organizations) whose mission is enhancing the health and welfare of its members and their families. INTEGRATION OF SERVICES Managed Behavioral Health Care The most common form of EA integration is between an employer- sponsored managed behavioral health care (MBHC) benefit and. its EAP. In this discussion the phrase \"managed behavioral health care\" refers to both mental health and substance abuse.The concept and practice of\"integration\" refers to programs and/or services that are accessed through a single point, usually atoll-free telephone number. Integrated programs attempt to streamline beneficiaries' ease of use throughout the continuum of service.They also allow for customization and alignment of plan designs, ongoing coordination of services, reduction of service duplication, continuity of care and minimization of cost shiftirig. Keys to ensuring ease of access to-services are program prom *~oi~..= t~~~ ~ ~r-< <~~ ~:~c~~ ~r; end wellness, and Human Resources staff competence training. An extension of the integration between EAPs and MBHC benefits is the evolving set of linkages between EAPs and other services. These types of services include, but are not limited to, WorWlife services, drug-free workplace programs, critical incident /stress debriefings, web-based EAP products, psychiatric disability and disease management programs, and the still-evolving E-therapy services. internal and external EAPs take various roles in the integration with MBHC,from a simple intake capacity with the MBHC plan providing referrals, to models where the EAP also provides assessment, referral and managed care services.ln these less prevalent models,the EAP contracts with a treatment provider network and the needs of the employer govern the type of EA services provided. EAPs Integrated with Work/Life Services A more recent phenomenon for EA service provision is integration with Work/Life services, such as child care and elder care resources and referral.The early 1980s were a growth period for Work/Life services as women began to enter the workforce in much larger numbers. Employers became aware of the need for quality childcare to support the two-parent workforce. By 1985,there were several private companies administering resource and referral services for large multi-site employers, primarily assisting employees in finding and managing childcare arrangements. As the '80s progressed, baby boomers began to experience significant issues with their elderly parents.Theaddition of elder care services to the Work/Life field was a controversial development. Many EAPs had already been providing services in the elder care area and the issue was whether WorWLife programs or EAPs were more appropriate for handling eider issues. At this time there have not been evaluations performed to ascertain the better model for service delivery. The WorWLife companies moved away from addressing only dependent care Issues and evolved to be more focused on the holistic approach to providing support to the workforce, addressing the broader notion of finding balance between work and family.To appeal to a broader, more diverse audience, additional services were developed, such as educational services, concierge, financial, or legal. In the mid- to late-90s, it became clear that the EAP and Work/Life fields needed to partner in their support of a productive work environment by offering employers an integrated model of service\u2014one stop shopping, in the late 1990s, many larger national EAPs merged with WorWLife companies or developed partnerships to support an integrated model of service delivery. WEB-BASED SERVICES Many EAPs have begun to offer web-enabled services, The Internet provides client. organizations with a platform for inexpensive, yet customized, EA promotional information via intranets and emails. Web-based EA products offer a wide range of services: notification of company benefits and policies; preventative education; multimedia access to early, confidential self-assessment services; resources and tools for managers; coaching ~ h<3~. echnology.Common offerings include mental health clinical content, which may include tip sheets, wellness information, assessment and screening tools, as well as helpful articles on a variety of topics. These services are offered through' self-assessment tools and dial-a-counselor programs. Perhaps. most compelling is the technology's 24 hours a day; 7 days a week availability, which accommodates different work schedules and locations while offering privacy and confidentiality and may increase access from those client segments most hesitant about seeking traditional face-to-face counseling. The National Board has developed one notable set of practice guidelines for delivering online mental health services for Certified Counselors (posted at its website: tiif~7:~iVJVJYJ.i iriCC.00C~i EiiiiCSi VJc'~~iiliCS.riifTlj, Two of the most common methodologies for web-based services utilize a synchronous or asynchronous approach. Asynchronous web service communications occur with the EA professional and the client working at different times. Email and instant messaging are examples of this. Asynchronous web services can also be used to provide psycho education, or web-based bibliotherapy. in this instance, the EA professional would refer the client to informative websites and other electronic sources of information. With the psycho- education approach, an EA professional must be competent in how to recognize when to move the client into more traditional face-to-face services, as appropriate. Synchronous web service communications occur simultaneously (in\"real\"time) utilizing interactive electronic technology such as video and voice or audio via computer, with no lag between interactions. Chat room technology is an example of this technique. EA professionals understand the Internet is not appropriate for all clients at every level of service, but part of a continuum of options.The eventual promise of web-based technology to successfully deliver services beyond mere health education is not that far in the future. Evaluation of such services is needed. DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE PROGRAMS In 1988, the US Congress passed the Drug-free Workplace Act, which requires most federal contractors and grantees to 222 certify that aDrug-free Workplace program has been established containing basic mandated elements. These elements require employers to develop and communicate adrug-free workplace policy, distribute information about the dangers of workplace drug abuse and opportunities to get help, and report workplace drug convictions. They do not mandate but suggest the development of EAPs. Subsequently, other industry sectors with safety-sensitive and national security concerns (such as transportation, nuclear energy and defense contracting) have come under additional Federal agency drug-free workforce requirements, including drug and alcohol testing. In general, employment positions with safety- sensitiveduties are likely to have drug and alcohol testing requirements. EAPs may offer several types of drug-free workplace specific services to employers, including supervisory training to help recognize the signs of alcohol and drug abuse, conducting employee drug and alcohol educational efforts, establishing and administering testing programs, and providing Substance Abuse Professionals (SAPS) to conduct substance abuse assessment, referral to treatment and follow-up monitoring upon return to duty. CRITICAL INCIDENT STRESS MANAGEMENT EA providers may also offer critical incident stress management (CISM) services as part of their product line. Critical incidents are defined as a sudden, unanticipated situation or circumstance that produces a high degree of distress. Examples include national disasters, accidental or sudden deaths, assaults, workplace accidents, robberies, homicides, suicides and terrorist attacks. Varying types of responses may be utilized after these events depending on the intensity or details, the culture of tl;e crganizatior and the level cf impact on individual or groups of workers. These responses are known as defusing and debriefings. A defusing would occur immediately after the event, within hours, while a debriefing could be provided within 24-48 hours following the incident. Therapeutic activities include normalizing feelings, encouraging discussion through a review of the facts, surfacing participant's thoughts /feelings/ reactions, identifying employees who are experiencing severe reactions and supporting individual's coping mechanisms to relieve fears and anxiety around the event.This type of support can include web-based education /information, telephonic assistance,onsite support, face-to-face assessment, and counseling and/or follow-up. There is also a need to provide support and consultation to management after a critical incident and EAPs typically play a key role. Management should be educated regarding what to expect, the reactions they may see, performance issues and types of resources available to employees and dependents. Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, EAPs have added terrorist activity to the list of critical incidents to which they are prepared to respond. EAPs can consult with management on development of disaster recovery and emergency response plans for any contingency.Thesepro- active approaches can range from education, stress inoculation and fear reduction, to recovery /relocation plans and back-up strategies, to help keep workers safe and assist them in returning to productivity as soon as feasible. 223 PSYCHIATRIC DISABILITY MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS Over the past decade, the impetus behind the development of enhanced disability management products was the rapid growth of employers' disability costs\u2014an increasing percentage of these costs due to behavioral health disabilities. In 1995, psychiatric disability cases were 53~/o more costly than non-mental health cases and lasted 92%longer. (\"McCulloch, Goldman\" et al.) Evolving disability management products focus on early identification of potential or actual cases, accelerated access, intensified treatment provided byspecialty- trained providers, integrated treatment teams, and return to work facilitation and follow-up. In addition to case management services, specialty case managers provide workplace assistance to supervisors while helping with. modified duty schedules, reasonable accommodation approaches and preparation of the work group to ease the returning employee's reentry into the work force. Administration of a managed psychiatric disability program is usually coordinated with an employer's general disability administrator and with the benefits department. PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATION Established ih 1986, the Employee Assistance Certification Commission (EACC) administers a professional credential, the Certified Employee Assistance Professional (CEAPO), to identify EA practitioners meeting established standards for competent ,client-centered practice and adhering to an enforceable code of professional and ethical conduct. Each candidate must meet experience, professional development and advisement requirements and pass a qualifying examination. The Commission remains the autonomous credentialing body responsible for all aspects of the CEAP program, including establishing policies and procedures of the CEAP credential; examination development; and ethics code enforcement. In January 1987, the EACC commissioners approved the CEAPO designation for those successfully completing certification requirements.As of December 2001, more than 5,500 CEAPs were practicing in the United States and in 16 foreign countries. Future Trends in EAProfessional Certification The EACC and the LEAP credential continue to evolve. A new version of the CEAP examination debuts in May 2002 reflecting revised job requirements identified by a recent role delineation study, and will include test questions based on different cognitive levels. Application and analysis skills are integral to competency in EA practice, and items to assess these two higher cognitive levels are now incorporated. Already widely recognized in the US and Canada, to make certification more accessible to those in the international community the Commission has adopted revised advisement requirements and developed internationally relevant versions of the examination. in response to the EA profession's increasingly sophisticated professional development needs, the EACC continues.to prepare for advanced certification (e.g. a Masters -level CEAP) and the possibility of providing sub-specialty credentials, such as a Substance Abuse Professional and critical incident stress debriefing certification.The US Army recently adopted the CEAP credential for its civilian and uniformed employees working as substance abuse specialists. 224 EA PROGRAM ACCREDITATION In 1981,the Standards for Employee Alcoholism and/or Employee Assistance Programs were drafted by a joint committee representing the Association of Labor/Management Administrators and Counselors, the National Council on Alcoholism, the Occupational Program Consultants, and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. From this early effort until today,the need for program standards and practice guidelines has taken on increasing importance in the EAP field. While both the Employee Assistance Professionals Association (EAPA) and the Employee Assistance Society of North America (EASNA) have actively supported the need for international standards of practice, only two organizations are accrediting EAPs today. The Council on Accreditation (COA) began accrediting EA service providers as components of Child and Family Service organizations in 1987.Of over 100 EA program services accredited under this process, most are part of larger multi-service child and family orr~~nizations in tl~e U~ ~n~! Canada. In 2001, COA expanded their accreditation of EAPs by collaborating with EASNA to create a separate book of standards for stand-alone EAPs. In June 2002, the Council on Accreditation became the EA accreditation service provider and will own the new revised standards to be published in the latter part of the year. The Council on Accreditation ofRehabili[ation Facilities (CARE) established an EA program accreditation product in 1988. Most of the 21 EAPs receiving CARE accreditation to date are provided through community human service organizations or EAP counseling agencies. There are many different market forces that have led to the increasing importance of accreditation in the EA field.The consolidation of EAPs throughout North America has increased the visibility of accreditation and the need to use accreditation as a means of differentiation and quality improvement. Accountability to internal and external stakeholders has also increased.Accreditation is one tool that an EAP can use to demonstrate accountability.The search for a common language for the field and common definitions of what constitutes a case or how utilization is determined have led EA service providers to adopt accreditation as a means of standardization. EAPs have also moved towards accreditation as a way of self-regulating and to prevent excessive oversight or regulation at the Federal or State level. Typically, an EAP undergoing the process of accreditation engages in a period of self-study and evaluation during which the EAP itself determines whether it complies with a set of best practice standards. In cases during which it does not comply, the EAP typically takes time to rewrite policies and implement new procedures.Once an EAP has determined its readiness for accreditation, ifi submits pre-site documentation to demonstrate its compliance with each best practice standard. After studying the materials and assigning pre-site scores, peer reviewers or surveyors then visit the EAP to ensure on-site compliance with the standards. Following the site visit, an EAP receives a detailed report showing areas of compliance and areas that need improvement. Once an EAP has met a certain level of organizational compliance, it is awarded an accreditation. 225 Additionally, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is continuing to provide support and interest for standards development for other EA services such as Member Assistance Programs, Student Assistance Programs, Integrated EAPs, and Consortiums /public EAPs. SAMHSA is also supporting an effort to collect data during the accreditation process to develop performance benchmarks and outcome measurements for the EAP industry and, thus, better inform the industry of what constitutes a best practice.The University of Maryland works with COA in this effort. With the rapid changes occurring in the EAP field and the increasing importance placed on its services, maintaining international standards of best practice and demonstrating quality improvement is important not only for the EAP but for the many people it serves. It seems that the quest for this measurement of quality can best be achieved through the accreditation of Employee Assistance Programs. EA PROGRAMS I~ AN INTFRNATIONAb.. Ct~NTEXT Until 1996, cross-cultural research data identifying the extent and nature of EA programs from a global perspective was lacking, challenging any appreciation or evaluation of the uniqueness of different cultures and their respective responses to workplace mental health needs. With the publication of the international Employee Assistance Anthology in 1996, and its second edition in 2000 (Masi, D., A, 1996, 2000), a consolidation and documentation of EA program data from an international perspective emerged. EA activities in over 40 countries were included in each of these publications. Information was collected for each country in the areas of psycho- socio-economic climate, health and welfare system particulars, relevant social work legislation, the History, development and current state or' EA or occupational health and any emerging trends. For the international EA community, the collected information: highlights the diversity and uniqueness of regional workplace -based mental health issues; acknowledges the relative understanding of mental health issues by employers and responses by country; demonstrates the differences, strengths and gaps inherent in each country's EA service delivery models; clarifies the differences between EA and occupational social work, both of which may co-exist in various regions; identifies an overarching concern for the negative effects of substance abuse on employees; identifies rising health care costs as a shared international concern; and reinforces the role of organized labor as astakeholder inworkplace -based assistance programs in countries where a majority of the workforce are union members By omitting some nations the Anthologies also illustrate those countries not currently providing mental health assistance to employees, or at least not in a manner resembling North American standards. Although the Anthologies provide one of the few comprehensive summaries of international EA efforts to date, some organizations have worked towards the development of standard practices in the EA international arena. In 1996, representatives of the EAPA from 14 countries developed Guidelines for International EA programs designed to be applicable in different locales and culture. In the recent partnership between the EASNA and the Council on Accreditation, international EAP accreditation standards are currently under development that will have broad applications to the practice of EA across global borders. 226 In Europe, although the appearance of EA programs is relatively recent, the professional discipline of occupational social work has a long history in many countries and is represented in the continent by the European Network of Occupational Social Workers (ENOS), founded in 1990. ENOS' primary mandate is to act as a transfer point for the exchange of Information between occupational social work representatives from each European country. Although different in nature and mandate than EAP in North America, the network of occupational social wprkers provides some similar functions for European employers as EAP practitioners do in North America. In Australia and New Zealand, a relatively robust EA industry exists, with an estimated 30% market penetration (Hopkins,t999). In Latin America and Asia,the initial appearance of EA was largely initiated by the needs ofmulti- national companies and consortiums to provide EA services to expatriate employees, although many of these multi-nationals have begun to extend program services to in-country workers and other worksites as appropriate in the local market and climate. Worid Strategic Parrr7ers is an international health industry network whose mandate is to empower and influence health and policy leaders to succeed by providing access to its professional network, international healthcare initiatives, and a forum for knowledge exchange. World Strategic Partners hosts an annual Global Symposium at the International Labor Organization in Geneva, Switzerland, to reinforce the essential nature of the individual's well being in relation to the employer's well being. Key public and private sector leaders and decision -makers from around the world gather at this international symposium to address the global movement toward individual and organizational wellness: As the movement for information sharing and standardization of practice increases, it is more apparent that external factors, such as the globalization of multinational corporate organizations, lowering of barriers to the free movement of goods and services the advent of the information superhighway,and other technological advancements, have provided a new,wider lens through which to view the world.This evolution has provided the opportunity to experience and understand global cultural differences, and in doing so, hopefully to learn that human beings share more similarities than perhaps previously thought. On a more practical scale, human beings worldwide may continue to experience problems in their daily lives that negatively impact their ability to perform in the workplace and to contribute to the productivity of the organization. Mental health knows no geographical or socioeconomic boundaries. Although standards and practices may vary from country to country, the response involved in addressing employee mental health issues is borne out of a commonality among human beings that transcends race, culture, language and gender differences. TRAINING AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT BACKGROUND The earliest EA professionals were originally called occupational program consultants (OPCs). Many were senior employees 227 who combined their business savvy and personal recovery from alcoholism to start industrial alcoholism programs to assist employees.The Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention,Treatmentand Rehabilitation Act of 1970 (often. referred to as the Hughes Act after its primary sponsor, Senator Harold Hughes), established the National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA). In their groundbreaking Special Report on Alcohol and Health, NIAAA estimated 5 percent of the workforce suffered from alcoholism and another 5 percent were serious alcohol abusers (FirstSpecialReport to the U.S. Congress on Alcohol and Health, 1971), Pegging the annual cost of lost work time due to alcohol abuse and alcoholism at $10 billion, the report endorsed industrial alcoholism programs and their therapeutic value. (United States Department of Health and Human Services, 1987) NIAAA subsequently provided funding for 100 occupational program consultants (known as the \"Thundering 100\") who were instrumental in the rapid growth of many internally staffed corporate and union-based EAPs in the 1970s. OPCs successfully educated errmployers that proper assessment and opportunities for treatment combined with leveraging the employment contract could be instrumental in returning employees with performance problems to productivity. OPCs also consulted with employers in developing workplace policies and procedures for corrective action based on job performance, rather than alcohol use. PROFESSIONAL TRAINING The diversity of backgrounds among EA practitioners has created unique training and professional development cnailenges for the EA industry. EA proTessionafs have degrees and training in social work; psychology, psychiatric nursing, addictions counseling, and organizational development, to name a few. To date, opportunities for higher education in EA program services have been limited, although some notable exceptions such as the University of Maryland's School of Social Work do exist,The current extent and prevalence of EA courses in higher education is unknown. Columbia University and Hunter College offer occupational social work programs, which are similar to EAPs. Explanations for the reluctance of professional schools to develop and insfiitutionalize EA training curriculums include the historical mix of EAPs from a broad range of disciplines outside academia and the di~cuity in identifying qualified faculty with adequate knowledge and academic qualifications to champion such programs. Given the relative lack of traditional academic established pathways for EA professionals, the majority of initial and continuing education for prospective and established EA practitioners has emanated from within the fleld.Over the years, EA professional associations have labored to define the skills and expertise needed to provide quality and ethical employee assistance services. The Employee Assistance Certification Commission's release of national standards for achieving employee assistance professional certification (or \"CEAP\") in 1987 has been one of the major influences fueling the proliferation of professional development opportunities in the industry. These are typically delivered through national training conferences and institutes, as well as through regional and local chapter meetings,aithough distance learning and web-based professional development opportunities are proliferating, as they are in all occupations. 228 Larger EA and more recently integrated EA/managed behavioral health care organizations routinely provide in-service education to their employees, although some critics have observed these types of training may tend to emphasize procedure over practice issues. Various union organizations, such as the Labor Assistance Professionals Association and the American Association of Flight Attendants customarily provide specialized training for their members serving in union-affiliated programs. Other EA-related training for special applications such as those serving as Substance Abuse Professionals under the US Department of Transportation's regulatory requirement have also been provided by various professional association and for-profit groups. FUTURE ISSUES /N PROFESSIONAL TRAINING As EA services have diversified and expanded from.an industrial alcoholism to broad brush and the relatively recent Work/Life orwork- family approach, employers have increased expectations of EAPs, creating demands for enhanced initial and. ~~ i:i,~:; nfr n+-;; ;;r~i~ning of as workpizce violence, threat assessment, critic~a incident stress, and work family services were barely visible on the EA radar screen fifteen years ago. The \"outsourcing revolution\" of EAPs from internal departments to external delivery systems integrated through EA/managed behavioral health organizations can sometimes result in a blurring of EA services with mental health treatment leading to a perception that EA skills have narrowed to merely clinical counseling and case management services.The implication for EA professional development is that this shift may ultimately result in a universe of EA practitioners with limited organizational knowledge, skills and practical workplace -based experience. And, if such trends continue, there will be increasingly fewer opportunities to cultivate ti~is organizational skill set once considered integral to internal tN services and which ultimately serves to differentiate EA practitioners from other mental health care providers and counselors. Familiarity with workplace substance abuse issues, historically a strength for EA professionals, appears to be a casualty of the new demographic profile of EA service providers. This, coupled with the ever-increasing scientific advances in understanding addictions and their application to EA practice, has returned the professional development issue to central importance. No matter how broadly or narrowly defined, EA service providers must be able to address employee performance, workplace policy development, human resource management consultations, and supervisory and organizational development issues: There is a companion need to increase the level of understanding, human resource and benefit consultants by mainstreaming information about EAPs and required course work into the business and professional schools that train our future health and human service professionals. RESEARCH Generally speaking, EA research efforts have been conducted with an eye to the following areas: 1) prevalence of EA services in the workforce;2) studies of EA program characteristics and functions and 3) outcome evaluations of EA service delivery. 229 PREVALENCE OF SAPS A 1985 survey conducted by the US Department of Health and Human Services reported just under one-quarter (24 percent) of mid- tolarge -size private-sector worksites (over 50 employees) offered EAPs. (US Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics,1988) In 1988,the Bureau of Labor Statistics conducted a more extensive Survey of EmployerAntl -drug Programs of 7,502 private sector employers of ail sizes. Results of this survey estimated an overall prevalence rate for EA programs of six and one-half percent of all sizes of worksites, but these programs covered approximately 31 percent of US employees. Additionally, about three percent of employers without EAPs were considering establishing one, The survey revealed the most Important factor in EA implementation was establishment size. 76 percent of the nation's largest establishments (1000 or more employees) had instituted EAPs,versus only nine percent of the smallest (fewer than 50 workers). Differences in EAP coverage were less by industry, although industry differences were notable. The mining, communications, public utilities, and transportation industries were most likely to have EAPs,while the retail trade, service, and construction industries ~,~~ere the Jeast likel~~, This ;s not surprising considering that small employers. dominate these industries- 76,perc~nt.cr construction and services establishments had fewer than 10 employees, as did 67 percent of retail trade firms. In 1990, BLS conducted afollow -up study with a portion of the 1988 respondents. Results indicated eight percent of the employers without an EAP in 1988 had-one by 1990.Overall, the percentage of worksites offering access to EA services increased approximately 5 percent, from 6.5 to nearly 12 percent, with larger businesses starting programs at a much greater rate than smaller establishments. (Haygue,1991) This trend of sustained EAP growth continued into the 1990s,The 7993 National SurveyofWorksitesand EmployeeAssistance Programs of over 3000 worksites confirms EAP market share expansion to an estimated prevalence of one-third of mid- to large-sized US workplaces (over 50 employees). EAPs were more likely to be found in workplaces where employees were unionized, employees -were more educated, and the workplace had relatively few minorityworkers, Geography, however, seemed fio have no impact on the existence of programs. Additionally, this study reported a marked shift in EA service delivery\u2014 away from the historical on-site by internal EA program personnel and towards a majority (81 percent) of services provided by external vendors at off-site locations (Hartwell, et a1.,1996). A special module of questions included in the 1994 and 1997 National Household Survey of Drug Abuse collected information on workplace substance abuse interventions, including EAPs. Findings again illustrated a marked disparity in access to EA services relative to establishment size, although continued increases in overall EA coverage were evident. In 1994,15 percent of workers in small establishments reported access to EA services. By 1997, this number increased to 28 percent, whereas 61 percent of workers in mid-sized worksites and 75 percent of workers in large establishments reported EA coverage (US Department of Health and Human Services, SAMHSA,1999). Open Minds, a behavioral health industry research and consulting firm in Gettysburg, PA began its annual surveys of managed behavioral health and EA providers in 1994, reporting an estimated 27.2 million individuals enrolled in EAPs- 230 20 million in stand-alone EAPs and 7.2 million in integrated managed behavioral health/employee assistance programs.By 2001, it estimates enrollment figures of 51 million in stand-alone EAPs and 15.5 million in integrated managed behavioral health/employee assistance programs.That marks a 245 percent increase since 1994 and a 13.3 percent increase over 1999 (Open Minds, 2000). The Society for Human Resource Management's 2001 BenefJts Survey provides further testimony of strong market penetration with 67 percent of 754 HR professionals responding that their organization offers an EAP, 5 percent stating their organization plans to offer one in the coming year, and only 24 percent stating they do not. Similarly, industries subject to government regulation and workplaces with more acute occupational safety concerns (such as energy, transportation and pubiicsafety) almost universally provide access to employee assistance services,That stands in contrast to food service, hospitality, retail sales and temporary or contract labor services .(Society for Human Resources Management, 2001), COSTS OF EAPS ~ - Fees for externally provided EA services are typically calculated annually on a per capita basis (i.e number of employees multiplied by cost per year) although occasionally a fee for service arrangement is used. Program charges range by company or worksite and are typically negotiated between provider and employer on an individual contract basis Differences in the type, extent, staffing levels and expected utilization of services offered to program participants can affect cost proposals. Other cost factors have historically included -size of employee population and number of worksites. Using a standardized approach, a Research Triangle Institute case study of seven different EAPs during the fiscal years 1991-93 examined personnel, operating expenses, facilities, equipment and supplies.Their comparative analysis estimated an annual EAP cost per eligible employee, with widely divergent results ranging from a low of $10.58 to a high of $181.47.The study noted that differences in delivery of services were major cost factors and also documented a consistent association of higher utilization rates with higher costs per employee (Bray, et al, 1996). Another national EAP prevalence survey published in 1996 reported a national average of $26.59 for internal programs and $21.47 for external programs (Hartwell, et a1.,1996). Another survey conducted by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans of 185 multi-employer health plan administrators echoes other findings that EAP costs are dependent on multiple factors, expected and historic utilization levels in a given group, and whether the EAP is internal or external. With 90 percent of fund administrators reporting EA services were provided by external contractors, the average annual cost per participant was $29, and the median annual cost per participant to multi-employer funds was $25 (International Foundation for Employee Benefit Plans, 2001). Over the past decade, costs for externally provided EAPs have generally not risen excessively and in many cases have remained stable. This is likely due to intense intra-market competition and the. enduring trend towards combining EA services with managed behavioral health and WorWLife programs as integrated products. 231 QUANTITATIVE AND QUAL/TATI VE RESEARCH Compared to other mental health and related disciplines, the EA field has not produced a plethora of sophisticated or scholarly research. Speculation about this relative dearth of rigorous academic studies includes recognition of the aforementioned lack of academic programs at US colleges and universities, the natural home of such activity. The largely independent and self-funded nature of private sector EAPs is perhaps the best explanation for the relatively few large-scale research studies. However, many employers have undertaken their own internal evaluations of EAP cost-effectiveness and its value to the host work organization. Reports of these highly anecdotal reviews of program performance are typically written in business language using economic rather than mental health terms. Additionally, given their proprietary nature, some corporations have chosen not to publish such evaluation findings in the public domain. However, the continuous, steady growth of EAPs in all types of workplaces suggests a widely held assumption among CEOs and human res~~~cce professiona'c of the re.sitive effect that EAPs have on the\"bottom line.\" Though EAP cost effectiveness studies have recently become more empirically based, the literature tends to be dominated by studies that do not subscribe to high levels of scientific rigor or case studies without general application to the workforce. Some of this lack of empirical data is also attributed to a variety of issues long recognized as barriers in the mental health arena: difficulty in quantifying necessary variables the need to respect client confidentiality, and arelative scarcity of resources. Several authors have weighed in on both sides of this discussion and raised more specific issues. Collins (1998) suggests two explanations. First, he notes the short supply of analytical resources for both internal and external programs, Secondly, he maintains that absenteeism -coding formats, a widely accepted measure in the cost-effectiveness studies, are not uniformly recorded across the industry, Blaze-Temple and Howat (1997) add that many mental health care professionals lack both background and expertise in research. Tramm (1990) cites the growing professionalism of the EA field, which increasingly includes graduate or higher academic degrees and has boosted the recognition of program evaluation as a valuable fiool. Likewise, the most recent program standards from EA professional associations include periodic evaluation as an essential component of best practices. COST EFFECTIVENESS STUDIES Even with these qualifications, Roman and Blum (1995) contend that EAPs tend to be on the leading edge of cost- effectiveness research in the behavioral healthcare field, perhaps because of the business influence.They categorize EAP cost effectiveness studies as tending to fall into three categories: Pre-post test designs with few outcome measures. Comparison studies where the control groups mayor may not be legitimately matched. Case studies of specific business concerns that may or may not build on existing models or operational definitions of outcome measures. 232 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' evaluation of the Employee Counseling Service (ECS) is a model for the use of a control group with repeated collection of measurable data.This model, developed in the mid 1980s, remains an industry standard of rigorous research design, reviewing cost effectiveness and cost-benefit of the ECS and over 2,000 EAP cllents.The study evaluated the components of context, inputs, process, impact, and outcomes with a client tracking system (CTS). The CTS measures client status, work performance by supervisors, and personnel data at intake, a three- month follow-up, and a nine-month follow-up. Results identified the dollar benefits in only six months were $1,274 per employee served; for every dollar spent a return of $1,29, and an estimated 5 year cost-benefit ratio of 13 to 1 (Masi and Maiden, 1985). Masi Research Consultants conducted a study for the US Postal Service in 1994, capturing data from one year before EAP entry to one year after, and examined health insurance claims, personnel and financial variables, worker's compensation claims, EEO costs, and employee jab performance. Data from EAP clients was compared to a random sampling of non-EAP clients.On an order-of-mayriitude basis, cost benefit ratios conformed to prior results with some of the greater returns in the EEO and Workers'Compensationareas (Masi, Masi and Lieberman, 1995). The use of longitudinal data is described in a study of Virginia Power's EAP in 1991, using long-term longitudinal data to assess program's cost-effectiveness. Medical claims data four years prior to and four years after treatment were analyzed. Results indicated employee medical costs were 23 percent lower for EAP clients than those accessing behavioral heath care on their own. More surprising, the non-behavioral related medical costs showed a larger drop than the behavioral illness cost:32 percent vs.17 percent (Every and Leong, 1994). The Chevron Corporation initiated two cost-benefit analyses in the 1990s, a return on investment (ROI) study and a post-substance abuse treatment analysis of safety records (Collins, 1998): The ROI study calculated the value of retention compared to new hiring and training, improved productivity for mandatory and formal referrals, and improved productivity for self-referrals. Combining the totaled estimates from these three categories resulted in savings of approximately $20.6 million over five years, and considering Chevron's EAP annual budget of $1.5 million, yields a return ratio of 14 to 1. The 1990 McDonnell -Douglas -Health Strategies Study (Stern, 1990) is perhaps the best-known example of a comparative study of the effectiveness of an EAP linked with behavioral health benefits. It compared employees who used the EAP to access treatment for alcohol, tobacco, and drug (ATD) dependency or psychiatric conditions with a control group of employees utilizing services via traditional non-EAP sources. Follow-up case reviews revealed that ATD EAP clients missed 44 percentfewer workdays and psychiatric EAP clients missed 34 percent fewer workdays compared to the control group. Compared to the control group's 40 percent turnover rate, ATD EAP clients had a turnover rate of only 7.5 percent, while psychiatric EAP clients had a 60 percent lower turnover rate than the control group.Additionally, medical claims averaged $2,400 lower for EAP psychiatric cases than for employees who choose not to use the EAP and 35 percent lower for dependents who accessed treatment through the EAP, 233 Masi (1991) discusses another type of cost-benefit analysis, which uses monetized ratings for EA clients referred by a supervisor, The assumption employed by this analysis was that higher-rated employees are more productive than lower- rated workers and that productivity can be translated into dollar values. Scores at intake were compared with scores at three months and nine months toobtain asix-month value,and multiplied by salary levels to obtain a dollar benefit value. The results revealed a 13 to 1 return on investment. FUTURE DIRECTIONS In spite of rapidly evolving economic conditions that continuously create new challenges in today's work organizations, EAPs remain focused on providing quality support services to employers and their workers. Employers and other purchasers will continue to expect cost efficient, integrated and responsive EA service delivery,These services must be streamlined, relatively simple to administer, and above all, contribute to enhanced employee well ,being and increased .,, ,.- : produEtivity.There appe~r;~ rc t~~ at h ~ t rltr~. r,~;i~,r,-:tive trends likely to affect the EA field in program service, coverage and quality. The first trend is the drive for greater quality assurance in EA services.This trend is not unique to EAPs; it is universal across all health care and human service delivery systems, prompted by shrinking public and private resources and the continuous squeeze on worker benefits packages because of global competition. For both internal and external EA programs, the new accreditation standards delivered through peer-judged investigation will be only one of many motivations to turn a a~iiical eye oi~ uj~erations for compliance with besi practice recommendations and more efficiency, Related to the above trend will be wider recognition of the acute need for realistic EA outcome measures. In addition to cost benefits, purchaser (both employers and employee \"client\") appraisals of satisfactory EA services will be even more important. To date, the majority of client participation surveys have been limited self- assessments conducted by EA providers.jNhile considered of great value internally,the lack of standardization across data points or objective scoring are major methodological flaws and leave results open to criticism as lacking generalizability and are dangerously self-serving, IBM's EAP outcome study protocol provides a unique example of a work organization that avoids this common research pitfall through its reliance on an outside vendor in these activities. Regardless of the source of the reviewer, a greater incorporation of the purchasers' perspective is predicted for the future of EA outcome studies, as is an increased use of this particular evaluative technique in general.One unique feature of EA outcomes research is the tension between clinical and functional outcomes as measures of performance. The third trend in the future of EA evaluation and delivery involves the use of specific performance measurements. As the EA marketplace matures, both providers and purchasers will have to delineate (and ultimately agree upon) specific, meaningful performance measures. Due to the EA industry's likely continued affiliation with behavioral managed care, pressure will increase from that segment on EAPs to develop industry measures in a similar manner. When coupled with 234 increased demands for greater economies in service provision, performance measurements will then be utilized as performance guarantees by purchasers and benchmarked in contractual agreements via a system of financial penaties. The heightened interest in determining and incorporating program quality standards, developing meaningful performance measures, and conducting outcomes research will certainly increase demands to \"re-tool\"the EA industry's analytical and statistical competencies. This means providing EA professionals with the requisite level of professional development and training to accomplish needed tasks. Looking to the future, the international arena may hold the largest untapped potential for market expansion as the EA paradigm is applied globally. The future is bright for the EA field as it assumes its role as a true profession and the accompanying responsibilities of professional development, continued research, and, most importantly, provision of high quality services and programs. _ RESOURCES REFERENCES Blaze-Temple, D. and Howat, P, (1997).

All individuals were appointed as the official representatives oftheir organizations. The Organizations; Council on Accreditation (COA) Employee Assistance Professionals Association: (ETA. tJS! \" Employee Assistance.Prafessionals Associations International (EAPA Int'I) Employee Assistance Professional Associations of Australia (EAPA) Employee Assistance Society of North America (EASNA) European Network on Occupational Social Work (ENDS) International Council on Alcohol and Addictions (ICAA) International Federation of Social Workers (IFSW) The Mission of the Forum To create a global movement among professional and employer associations in the development and the alignment of collaborative international guidelines for Behavioral Health Services in the Workplace. The Vision of the Forum To create a global movement for continuous improvement of the well being of the workforce(s) and their families through collaboration and integration (of ideas, concepts and experiences) among professional international key players, Forum Objectives To design, to disseminate and to advocate international guidelines for Behavioral Health Services in the Workplace by aligning, customizing and optimizing existing local/national /regional guidelines and standards to the global level. The representatives also decided that upon their return to their respective organizations they would vote for an architect to draft these guidelines. In spring of 2002, Dr. Masi was elected by a majority of the representatives to be the architect. Methodology Solicitation went out to organizations for copies of guidelines that had been done by workplace organizations, and from the authors who contributed to the International Employee Assistance Anthology. MASI staff then formed a matrix of 237 twelve documents with each as it related to specific subject areas.' Dr. Masi then selected from the submissions of the respected organizations that which best represented a potential guideline.ln certain situations comments and additional clarification or further suggestions were included. Documents obtained: International Program Guidelines, Employee Assistance Professionals Association EAP National Guidelines,Australia /New Zealand Article ofAssociations of ENDS, European Network on Occupation Social Work (ENOS), Employee Assistance Professionals Associations European Forum,199S. (The most recent version of EAPA was received after the guidelines were drafted) Conceptual Framework for [he Professional Field of Occupational Social Work, Federal Association of Occupational Social Work ENOS -Germany ,;'international Federation of Social Work QFSW) Bern, Switzerland Government Guidelines for Workplace Menial Wellness Health Care System, Tokyo, Japan International Council of Alcoholism and Addictions 1999 Management ofAlcohol and Drug-related Issues in the Workplace, International Labor Organization,1996 Draft Code ofPractice on Managing Disability in the Workplace, International Labour Organization 2001 New Standards Guidelines,The Council on Accreditation UK Guide{ones forAud~t and Eva{uation for Ernp;oyee Assistance ?r~oGrams, i~{~, cr~~i~ Two presentations. were made. In May of 2003, Dr. Masi presented to the EAPA UK Chapter in London and received the following feedback: Members were extremely positive and supportive of the work thus far. There was strong opinion that the term EAP should be utilized as it is continually being used and replicated throughout the world, and that it would be a mistake to now introduce another term, What services would be included and what services that would not be included were discussed. Worklife was noted to bean important topic to be included. MASI has. already observed that there was not enough reference to the employer organization,so this would have to be added,There was agreement on this. There was support for Return On Investment to be included as well. In June of 2003, Dr. Masi also presented the International Guidelines for Work Based Programs at the Second Annual Advanced Employee Assistance Program (EAP) Management and Practice at the International Satellite Conference. One major question from the conference was how the Council on Accreditation (COA) and the Forum would work together. Timothy Stockert, Business Manager for the Council on Accreditation, responded to this issue: 238 COA is involved with The Forum in several different ways, Currently, COA has participatory representation on The Forum. COA has also contributed copies of its EAP standards (1 st and 2nd Editions), which Dr. Masi has used to develop the draft of Worldwide Guidelines in the Workforce. COA will continue developing and revising standards for the EAP industry in North America and will continue accrediting these EAPs.COA is supportive ofThe Forum's efforts to establish (nternation- al guidelines and will continue to work collaboratively with this group. WORLDWIDE MENTAL HEALTH GUIDELINES FOR THE WORKPLACE Mission/ Objectives It is essential that an EAP have a clearly stated and written mission statement. Ethics/ Values The EAP adopts and follows its own code of ethics, requires its professional staff and affiliates to adhere to the codes of ethics of their: respective,praf~ssions,an~~ :t!~,3~i, rorf~;,ts'i~ ~'s?'n carrying out its responsibility. Confidentiality The EAP gives clients written information that describes the EAPs confidentiality policy, and requires clients to sign a statement indicating their understanding of confidentiality rights and limitations. The EAP follows policies and procedures governing access to,use of;and release or disclosure of information Employers Employers should provide and maintain a safe and healthy workplace in accordance with the applicable law and regulations, and take appropriate actions. Employers should have the right to take appropriate measures with respect to workers with alcohol- and drug-related problems which affect, or which could reasonably be expected to affect, their work performance. Client Rights In recent decades, organizations of people with disabilities and their advocates have worked to make disability an issue of equal rights, rather than social welfare, and to generate change in opportunities for participation in employment and society.They have effectively challenged what is termed the\"medical\" model of disability,which focuses on the individual's impairment and inability to perform certain everyday activities, including work activities, and which sees solutions in individualized rehabilitation programs. in its place they have promoted the \"social\" model of disability, in which the focus is on the constraints arising from social, political, economic and cultural factors, as well as barriers in the built environment, and on solutions through measures to remove these constraints and barriers. 239 Management/ Board or Advisory Group An EAP, if not governed by a Board of Directors, should consider attaining an Advisory Board. EAP Pollcles There are two policies to consider in an EAP policy for the program and an EAP policy for the EAP organizations, EAPA expects that its members shall ensure that, wherever possible, an organization operating or implementing an E.AP shall have a policy that defines the purpose and objectives of the service and its relationship with other organizational functions.The program shall be clear and readily accessible to everyone involved. Intent The intent of the policy is to ensure that everyone is clear about the service and receives a consistent message. Program Design Create a Workplace Mental Wellness Policy, which incorporates Mental Wellness Systems at the workplace, assessment of workplace problems and implementation of mental health care, and professional personnel to provide mental health care. Implementation Guiding Principle An implementation plan outlines the actions needed to establish a fully functioning EAP and sets down a time frame for completion. Intent The implementation plan establishes the EAP as a distinct service within the organization. Supervisory Management Consultation Guiding Principle The EAP staff consults with key staff regarding the management and referral to the EAP of employees with job performance problems. Inient To increase the likelihood of early detection and adequate intervention by key staff in case employee behavior has negative effects on safety, health, well-being and/or workplace productivity. To contribute to the development of good leadership and a beneficial psychological environment. Recruitment, Training and Staffing The program should have a formula for adequate staffing, 240 Guiding principle An EAP should be staffed by an adequate number of individuals specifically trained in Employee Assistance Programming (program managers as well as counselors). Inreni EAPs are professional programs, which are staffed by designated individuals who are specifically trained in EAP service provision. While staffing patterns will vary according to the type and range of services provided, professional staffing patterns must meet the service. Union Representatives It is important for the success of EAPs that management /union representatives pro-actively support the introduction of EAPs into organizations, help develop policy &procedures, provide resources to operate and encourage employees to use EAP when necessary. Services Delivered Program Promotion, Education Booklets, brochures and posters, and other promotional material should be readily available and accessible to all Employees during the life of the program. EAP training is developed in such a way that can be incorporated into an organization's existing procedures and training schedules. All supervisors and managers should participate in workshops in EAP referral procedures and practices. All employees should be made aware of an EAP through an organization -wide awareness campaign. Prevention Services The EAP provides prevention services that address the following components: a. outreach; b. health promotion and wellness; and c.coordination with healthcare providers Topics addressed in prevention activities are changed and updated to reflect the needs and feedback of the host or customer organization and its employees. The EAP emphasizes the importance of prevention in all of its activities and offers to provide at least one primary prevention activity annually for the host or customer organizations. The EAP develops and offers educational sessions on wellness and other prevention -related topics. 241 Critical Incident Stress Management Standard EAPA expects its members to ensure that the purchasing organization has given careful thought as to how employees are supported in urgent serious or emergency situations in a timely fashion and consistent with organizational policies. Wherever possible, this service should be provided by the EAP. Access Procedures Procedures for accessing EAP services: a. minimize barriers to the timely initiation of services.or use of services; and b. give priority to employees or eligible participants with urgent needs or in emergency situations. The EAP communicates to customer employees and eligible participants that access to the EAP's services occurs through one of the following mechanisms: a. self referral by employees and eligible participants for problems that may be adversely affecting theirjob performance; b. referrals by supervisors and suggestions by union representatives, human resources, and/or medical personnel; and c. mandatory referrals. Work life The EAP conducts a needs assessment of the host or customer organization to determine the most a~rr~,nriate and effective work-life services for the host or customer organization and its employees. EAP assessment procedures include the use of a work-life intake tool to evaluate client needs. Evaluation includes site visit to Worklife providers and facilities. Drug-Free Work Place The EAP offers a need assessment to determine: a. what components of a Drug Free Workplace are most appropriate for the host or customer organization; and b. for which of the identified components the EAP will be providing services Organizational Development /Consultation Summing up, occupational social work\u2014being an integral part of an organizational conception \u2014represents an important connector between staffing and occupational policy. From its specific perspective, it may contribute further organizational development and personnel service to the benefit both of the company and of the employee's well-being and health preservation. 242 The offer of assistance has to cover a broad range, going far beyond simple casework counseling, in order to do justice to the complexity ofproblem /solution strategies appropriate for the organization, Occupational social work must be tailored to the organization and its employees according to their specific requirements. Furthermore, it may assist and cooperate in the development of personnel and organizational procedures. Target groups. Occupational work is intended for. all employees of the company /authority, as well as their family members, superiors and managers, the company /authority as an organization and its units. Clinical Services Assessment Guiding Principle EAP staff should: conduct an assessment to identify personal or work problems of employee or covered family members; develop a plan of action; and provide, recommend or refer the client to an appropriate resource for problem resolution. Intent: to match clients with the appropriate level of care. EAPs may be organized in such a way that they act essentially as a point of initial assessment and referral to caregivers in the community. Those caregivers could include medical doctors; specialists in alcohol and drug counseling; specialists in treatment and rehabilitation; and community -based organizations, including those of a self-help character. Some EAPs, however, also engage appropriate personnel to provide actual counseling treatment and rehabilitation services for individuals with alcohol and drug related problems, provided that referrals to outside professionals or institutions are performed as necessary. Short-Term Counseling Standard EAPA expects that programs shall establish procedures to determine if and when to provide short-term (session limited) problem resolution services. Initial assessments shall be conducted by those trained to determine the appropriateness of this kind of invention and match the employee client with the most suitable resource internally or externally. Monitoring.and Follow-up Standard EAPA expects that programs will have systems to offer the appropriate monitoring of progress for all clients referred to services external to the EAP. 243 Intent The intent is in a unique position to monitor and review the progress of referrals and the quality of care that clients receive outside of the EAP. Referral Guiding Principle: EAP staff refer clients to individuals or organizations that offer professional support, advice, and treatment in various fields of relevance that match best with the client and his/her needs. The EAP has procedures to facilitate client referrals.The procedures address the provision of consultation between the EAP and the .host or customer organization. The EAP has responsibilities for providing follow-up, aftercare, and transition for clients served. Agreements SUBCONTRACT /CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT Agreements with subcontractors require the same quality and level of staff training as that of the EAP. Affiliate Agreements Affiliate agreements are comprehensive and address the same performance standards required of EAP staff members such as training and credentials, and roles and responsibilities of the EAP and affiliate. Quality Assurance: Evaluation of Performances Guiding Principle EAPs should evaluate appropriateness, effectiveness and efficiency of their operations. Intent Meaningful evaluation of an EAP depends upon having measurable program objectives and quality data control mechanisms. The program evaluation has multiple purposes: Documenting the benefits of costs and resources expended on the company. Focusing the EAP on employee and organizational needs. Continuously improving the quality of the EAP and the efficiency of EAP operations. Outcome Measurements In each of its programs, and on an ongoing basis the EAP measures service outcomes for all clients, including: individual client satisfaction with ail services received; level of function; and level of achievement for goal of assessed problem or request for services. 244 EAP consumers give a satisfaction questionnaire to each client after the first session in all services. For its clinical services, the EAP collects and analyzes client self-reported outcomes and counselor reported outcomes toward achieving the service goals established at the first session. After each episode of training or consultation, the EAP surveys the services recipient to evaluate the impact of the training or consultation on his/her ability to handle the situation or situations in the workplace that the training or consultation was intended to address. Return on Investment (ROI) From the beginning of the program,a method should be developed to measure the cost benefit of the EAP program. Quality Improvement AffiliaCes An EAP that purchases services from affiliates monitors and evaluates those contracted services and implements correc- tive action, if necessary.
