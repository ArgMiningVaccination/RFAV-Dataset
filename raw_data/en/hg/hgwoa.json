The office strives to help students navigate and define their own experiences, whether those be a religious, humanist, atheist, or something beyond or in between. In addition, religious literacy remains valuable in a world where we must strive to respect and understand our increasingly diverse neighbors. The Office of Spiritual Life carries the tradition of the liberal arts by teaching students to communicate with people from all walks of life. Dialogue is a central tenet of spiritual life at Knox. Through spiritual and political dialogues, the Knox community can move towards understanding and allyship. The Interfaith Peer Educators are a team of student leaders who organize spiritual programming and resources for the campus in hopes of increasing awareness and fostering a safe and supportive community for religious and spiritual identities. They collaborate on projects and events with student spiritual organizations and facilitate engaging, respectful, and enlightening, interfaith and intercultural dialogues regarding spirituality and its intersections with other identities.
