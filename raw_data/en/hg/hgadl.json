Patients and methods: A case-control study was performed. Cases (n = 189) were diagnosed with ASD, while controls (n = 224) were volunteers from general schools, matched by sex and birth year to cases. Vaccination history and prenatal, perinatal, and neonatal factors from the Maternal and Child Health handbook, which was part of each subject's le, were examined. To determine the relationship between potential risk factors and ASD, crude odds ratios (ORs) and 95% condence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated, and the differences in mean values of the quantitative variables between cases and controls were analyzed using an unpaired t-test. Moreover, MMR vaccination and the effect of the number of vaccine injections were investigated using a conditional multiple regression model. Results: For MMR vaccination, the OR was 1.04 (95% CI, 0.65-1.68), and no signicant differences were found for the other vaccines. For all of the prenatal, perinatal and neonatal factors, there were no sig- nicant differences between cases and controls. Furthermore, regarding the presence of ASD, MMR vaccination and the number of vaccine injections had ORs of 1.10 (95% CI, 0.64-1.90) and 1.10 (95% CI, 0.95-1.26), respectively, in the conditional multiple regression model; no signicant differences were found.Conclusions: In this study, there were not any convincing evidences that MMR vaccination and increasing the number of vaccine injections were associated with an increased risk of ASD in a genetically homoge- neous population. Therefore, these ndings indicate that there is no basis for avoiding vaccination out of concern for ASD. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction Autism is a life-long neurodevelopmental disorder. Its preva- lence was long considered to be approximately 4 in 10,000 [1]. Due to broadening of the nosological categorization and more widespread recognition, however, in recent years the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [2,3] , which includes autism, Asperger syndrome, and Pervasive developmental disorder not Corresponding author approximately 1% world- wide [4-6] . Although the pathogenesis of ASD has not yet been elucidated, genetic risk factors are strongly implicated, because the relative risk (/NAKs) among siblings is greater than 20, and heritability is estimated to be as high as 38-90% [7-9] . In contrast, because the concordance rate of identical twins is not 100%, one can infer that environmental factors are also involved, and the recent increase in prevalence also indicates the involvement of various types of \"novel environmental exposure\". A debate has arisen over the contribution of vaccination as one environmental trigger of ASD. The view that vaccination and ASD onset are related dates back to 1998 when the Lancet article by Wakeeld et al. appeared [10] (the paper was retracted in 2010 because of ethical and methodological problems [11] ). Thereafter, other published reports suggested a link between the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine 0264-410X/$ - see front matter \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.01.093Y. Uno et al. / Vaccine 30 (2012) 4292- 4298 4293 (MMR) and ASD [12-14] , and concerns emerged that thimerosal, which is included in other vaccines as a preservative, and vac- cination with combined vaccines might be risks for ASD onset [15-17] . Other studies, however, that examined retrospective data and rejected any such link were published in rapid succession [18-26] . For example, some reported an increase in ASD prevalence despite a decline in the MMR vaccination rate [27,28] . In Japan, only two reports have been based on a time-series design, and the results suggested no relationship between MMR and ASD [29,30] . The most prominent articles in the past have focused mainly on the results of ecologic studies, and we will discuss the few existing case-control studies [31-33] . Each study demonstrated no differences between ASD cases and controls, failing to support a conclusion that immu- nization using MMR increases the risk of ASD onset. Worldwide, reports on studies of immunization with vaccines other than MMR are rare. Moreover, parents or legal guardians remain apprehensive about the perceived risk of ASD posed by vaccination [34-37] . Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate Japanese subjects, a genetically homogeneous popula- tion, regarding links between ASD and immunization with various vaccines, including MMR, as well as the association between ASD and the number of vaccine injections [38] . This is the rst case-control study in Asia investigating links between vaccina- tion and ASD onset. These links were examined in ASD cases and controls matched for sex and year of birth based on data found in the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) handbook. This hand- book, provided to all mothers by the relevant Japanese health system institution, is a highly reliable record of early develop- ment, health, and immunization, and health professionals (e.g. public health nurses, obstetricians, and pediatricians) keep record of most of the data listed in it [39,40] . In this study, therefore, data from the MCH handbook in terms of vaccination history, as well as potential prenatal, perinatal, and neonatal risk factors, were examined. 2. Patients and methods 2.1. Study population 2.1.1. Cases (Fig. 1) The study analyzed case data from patients of the Yokohama Psycho-Developmental Clinic (YPDC), Kanto area, Japan, which accepts only patients with suspected developmental disorders. Of the patients who initially consulted the YPDC from April 1997 (opening of the clinic) until March 2011, the cases consisted of patients who: (1) were diagnosed with ASD, and (2) had been born between April 1, 1984 and April 30, 1992, the possible time period for MMR vaccination. Subjects whose records in the MCH handbook were missing or illegible and those with a history of vaccination in another country were excluded. 2.1.1.1. Diagnosis of ASD. Patients were diagnosed based on the classications of pervasive developmental disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 4th edition (DSM-IV) and stan- dardized criteria using the Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorder (DISCO) [41,42] . The DISCO is recognized as one of the best ways to obtain a reliable and valid diagnosis of ASD [43] . One of several child psychiatrists on the team met the patient's parents and used the DISCO to take the patient's developmental his- tory. Another child psychiatrist or clinical psychologist conducted intellectual or developmental tests, such as the Psycho-Educational Prole-Revised and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition. After the interview and testing, the diagnosis was made by the team according to the DSM-IV criteria.2.1.1.2. Period of birth. MMR vaccination in Japan was conducted under specic circumstances. It was introduced in April 1989, and only one vaccination using MMR was included in the immunization schedule. The monovalent mumps and rubella vaccines remained the optimal choice of vaccine for those who did not participate in the MMR program. However, soon after the immunization program commenced, there were several cases of aseptic meningitis, which may have been caused by the mumps vaccine [44] . As a result, in April 1993, the Japanese government ceased extensive inocu- lation with MMR. Therefore, children born from April 1984 to April 1992 could receive the MMR vaccination, and those children were included in the present study. 2.1.2. Controls (Fig. 1) One to two controls were selected for each case, matched by sex and year of birth and recruited as volunteers from general schools in the Kanto area, the same area where YPDC patients reside. Con- sent for participation in the present study was obtained from the parents (or legal guardians) of the students. Students who had pre- viously been recognized as having developmental problems and were already receiving care were excluded, as were those whose records in the MCH handbook were missing or illegible and those with a history of vaccination in another country. 2.2. Source of data The vaccination history and potential prenatal, perinatal, and neonatal risk factors collected based on the MCH handbook, which was routinely attached to each patient's le, were exam- ined. The targeted vaccines were the MMR, generally used for infants, and the individual vaccines of the same type: the diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine (DPT); the polio vaccine; the Calmette vac- cine (BCG). For DPT, Polio, and B-encephalitis, there were many subjects who received these vaccines more than once. Therefore, the times of exposure to these vaccines were counted within the period of the rst three years, when ASD features rst appeared. Maternal hypertension (systolic blood pressure 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure 90 mmHg), albuminuria or edema, and anemia were examined as prenatal factors. The birth weight, head and chest circumference, duration of labor, delivery method (nor- mal delivery, cesarean section, and obstetrical vacuum extraction or forceps delivery), and Apgar score were examined as perina- tal and neonatal factors. Hypertension, albuminuria or edema, and anemia were recorded using a two-category scale (yes/no), and the Apgar score was recorded as an ordinal variable. Duration of labor, birth weight, and head and chest circumference were handled as continuous variables. The delivery method was recorded using a two-category scale (performed/not performed) for each delivery technique. 2.3. Selection of case children and matched control children Among the patients who initially consulted the clinic between April 1997 and March 2011, 1875 cases of ASD were identied. Of these, 89 cases were excluded because the MCH handbook was missing or the vaccination record in the handbook could not be read, and 3 were excluded because they had received MMR vac- cination overseas. Of the remaining 1783 cases, 1429 were born before March 1984 or after May 1992, leaving 354 cases (males: n = 286, 80.8%) born between April 1984 and April 1992, the pos- sible time period for MMR vaccination. The ASD group consisted of 280 subjects with Autistic disorder (79.1%), 27 subjects with Asperger disorder (7.6%), and 47 subjects with Pervasive develop- mental disorder not otherwise specied (13.3%).4294 Y. Uno et al. / Vaccine 30 (2012) 4292- 4298 Fig. 1. Numbers of potential cases and controls identied, excluded, and included in analysis. YPDC, Yokohama Psycho-Developmental Clinic; ASD, autism spectrum and child health handbook; MMR, measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. As controls, 252 subjects from the general school population were recruited into the present study. Of these, 28 cases were sub- sequently excluded because the MCH handbook was missing or the vaccination record could not be read. The goal was to have a matched control for each case. However, since there were not enough controls to match to all cases, 189 subjects were chosen randomly from the ASD group as a case group. The controls were individually matched to cases by age and sex. There were 189 cases, mean age 22.6 years (SD 2.2), and 224 controls, mean age 22.6 years (SD 2.2), with case-to-control ratios ranging from 1:1 to 1:2 (Fig. 1). 2.4. Statistical analysis 2.4.1. Analysis 1 Duration of labor was divided into 2 categories of normal (20 h) versus prolonged labor (>20 h). Because an Apgar score of less than 7 has been associated with increased ASD risk [45-48] , the Apgar score was divided into 2 categories of normal (7 points) and low (<7 points). In order to compare the backgrounds of the cases and controls, the crude odds ratios (ORs) and 95% condence intervals (CIs) were determined for each outcome. The relationship between ASD onset and the total number of vaccine injections was also investigated. The crude ORs and 95% CI were determined for each. The differences in the mean values of the quantitative variables between cases and controls were examined by an unpaired t-test. When necessary, the t-test was modied for unequal variances. 2.4.2. Analysis 2 Because this study was only concerned with the theoretical increase in the risk of ASD onset due to the MMR vaccine injection,a conditional logistic model was applied to evaluate the ORs of MMR vaccination after adjusting for other risk factors. 2.4.3. Analysis 3 The OR of the total number of vaccine injections after adjusting for other risk factors was evaluated with the conditional logistic model. 2.4.4. Power analysis Power analysis was performed in accordance to general power calculation model for chi squared statistics, t-test, and a condi- tional multiple regression model. In brief, power is determined with respect to degree of freedom and predened alpha level of the study (0.05), number of predictors (in case of a conditional multiple regression model, 4) after assuming effect size (in accordance with Cohen's criteria). Analysis 1 was performed using SPSS 17.0 for Japan, and Anal- yses 2 and 3 used the HALBAU 7. ORs were considered signicant when the lower 95% CI exceeded 1.0. The t-tests were two-sided, and signicance was dened as p < 0.05. For power calculation G*power v3.1 was used. 2.5. Ethical considerations This study was approved by the ethics committee at Nagoya University. All data used in this study were clinical data obtained in the course of conventional diagnosis and therapy, and cooper- ation in the study placed no burden on individual patients. The parents or legal guardians of all of the children in the control group provided their written, informed consent to participate.

Results 3.1. Vaccination rate and time of exposure to vaccines The vaccination rates in cases and controls were as follows: MMR, 24.9% of 96.3% and 97.3% (Table 1). The mean times of each vaccine injection in cases and controls were as follows: DPT, 3.8 times of cases and 3.7 times of controls; Polio, 1.9 times and 2.0 times; B-encephalitis, 1.7 times and 1.8 times (Table 2). 3.2. Analysis 3.2.1. Analysis 1 For each vaccination, the ORs of cases versus controls were as follows (no signicant differences were found): MMR, Mater- nal hypertension as a prenatal factor had an OR of 2.42 (95% CI, 0.53-12.36), but no signicant difference was found between cases and controls. For the other factors as well, cases did not have Table 2 The comparison of the times of vaccine injection between cases and controls.

As a perinatal and neona- tal factor, low Apgar score and obstetrical vacuum extraction or forceps delivery had an OR of 3.64 (95% CI, 0.66-26.39) and 1.28 (95% CI, 0.66-2.51), respectively, but no signicant difference was found between cases and controls. No other perinatal and neonatal factors showed signicant differences between cases and controls (Table 1). A t-test was performed on the mean values of the times of expo- sure to DPT, Polio, and B-encephalitis, birth weight and head and chest circumference between cases and controls, and no signi- cant differences were found (p > 0.05 for all). The minimum number of vaccine injections was 3, and the maximum was 13. The mean (standard deviation) number of vaccine injections of cases and con- trols was 11.4 (1.7) and 11.4 (1.7), respectively, and there was no signicant difference between cases and controls (t = 0.07, p = 0.94) (Tables 2 and 3). 3.2.2. Analysis 2 Maternal hypertension, low Apgar score, and obstetrical vac- uum extraction or forceps delivery, which had higher ORs in the results of Analysis 1, were investigated as confounding factors using a conditional multiple regression model. With regard to the pres- ence of ASD, MMR had an OR of 1.10 (95% CI, 0.64-1.90), and maternal hypertension, low Apgar score, and obstetrical vacuum extraction or forceps delivery had ORs of 4.19 CI, CI, 0.18-22.12) CI, 0.50-1.92), respectively.

Power analysis Regarding power analysis for chi square statistics and t-test, when effect size is set to medium (in accordance to Cohen's crite- ria), both samples that are characterized in our research had more than 80% power for detecting association, respectively. However, in case, size effect is set to small, calculated power were 52% at chi square statistics and 53% at t-test. Similarly, regarding a conditional multiple regression model, our sample had more than 80% of power for detecting association in case of medium effect size. However in case, size effect is set to small, calculated power was 56%. 4. Discussion The three previous case-control studies focused on the rela- tionship between ASD and MMR. Specically, the investigation of DeStefano et al. was based on the Metropolitan Atlanta Develop- mental Disabilities Surveillance Program [31] ; Smeeth et al. used data from the UK General Practice Research Database [32] ; and DeWilde et al. examined the association using the UK Doctors' Independent Network Database [33] .

The present study is the rst case-control study in Asia investigating the relationship between a variety of vaccines including MMR and the risk of ASD onset. These previous studies were conducted using relatively het- erogeneous samples in terms of genetic makeup. Conversely, the Japanese population is thought to be highly homogenous on the genetic level (which gives us the opportunity to minimize the effect of population-specic risk factors that might interact with envi- ronmental exposures (i.e. immunization)), and almost all Japanese parents have an MCH handbook. The fact that highly reliable infor- mation concerning the pregnancy, perinatal, and neonatal periods is collected in the handbook was advantageous for conducting this research. In this study, we could not nd the evidence that MMR vac- cination increases the risk of ASD onset. The present results support the ndings from the previous case-control studies con- ducted in Caucasian populations. Furthermore, we could not nd any evidences that other types of vaccines or a combined effect of multiple vaccines was associated with ASD onset. Therefore, this study did not support the theory that vaccinations should be avoided to reduce the risk of ASD onset. We should be more concerned about acquiring infectious diseases by avoiding vaccinations. In the results of this study, the 95% CIs of vaccinations, espe- cially DPT, Polio, and BCG had a wide range because of small power. The sample size was not large enough to absolutely exclude the possibility that DPT, Polio, and BCG vaccinations increased the risk of ASD onset. Additionally, there were no theories about an increase in the risk of ASD onset concerns with any single types of vaccine injection that were included in this study, other than the MMR vaccine. Then a conditional logistic model was applied not to DPT, Polio, and BCG, but to MMR which was more con- cerned with the risk of ASD onset. This study was limited to data from the MCH handbook, which from the viewpoint of conduct- ing an investigation is a highly reliable vaccination data source. On one hand we believe we have obtained very reliable results. How- ever, on the other hand, the information in this handbook does not include several factors which were known to increase the risk of ASD onset, such as parental age at birth, bleeding, birth order, pre- vious fetal loss, maternal prenatal medication use exclusively for hypertension and maternal toxaemia which were included in this study [49] , and coexisting conditions that may influence vaccina- tions received, for example cardiovascular disease, other physical diseases or anomaly, epilepsy, or allergy. We were not able to investigate such conditions in controls because of the nature of the data collection procedure, which involved community-based sampling. Moreover, the relationship is unclear between the time periods when ASD was diagnosed and when the child was vacci- nated. It has been hypothesized that early exposure to thimerosal and immune globulin preparations influence neuropsychological decits in children include ASD [16,50] . Additionally, it is possi- ble that parents lost motivation regarding vaccination before ASD was diagnosed because of problems such as the child's inability to sit still or frequent tantrums. Even so, both groups showed a high vaccination rate for each of the vaccines, and because the main topic of this study was to investigate whether vaccination increases the risk of ASD onset, we believe these effects can be ignored. In future studies on vaccination and ASD, investigations with larger sample sizes are expected, and we anticipate examining fac- tors which were known to increase the risk of ASD onset, coexisting conditions that may influence vaccination, such as cardiovascular disease, other physical diseases or anomaly, epilepsy, or aller- gies, the age at ASD diagnosis and vaccines injection, and reasons why vaccinations were not performed. We also look forward toY. Uno et al. / Vaccine 30 (2012) 4292- 4298 4297 prospective studies that include pregnancy, delivery, or even pre- conception factors that may be associated with ASD. In this study, we could not nd any convincing evidence that MMR vaccination and increasing the number of vaccine injections were associated with an increased risk of ASD in a genetically homogeneous population. If such an association exists, it is so rare that it could not be identied in this large regional sample. There- fore, our ndings indicate there is no basis for avoiding vaccination out of concern for ASD. This study investigated the link between vaccination and the risk of ASD, but it does not guarantee the safety or efcacy of the vaccines. Adverse reactions from vaccines other than a link with ASD exist. Such adverse reactions must be studied, and safer and more effective vaccines must be developed. At one time in Japan, mumps vaccine in the MMR vaccine caused several cases of aseptic meningitis. We should continue to investigate the safety and efcacy of vaccines carefully and the biological features of ASD in greater depth to improve outcomes related to long-term function and quality of life.
