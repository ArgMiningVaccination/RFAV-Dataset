Shamanic healing combines energy work, sounds, and conversation to bring the whole person into balance with the world. People seek Shamanic healing for stress, trauma, wellbeing, and as a supplement to traditional medicine and therapy. Shamanic Healing Shamanic healing is a physical, mental, and energetic journey between the Shaman and client. Through conversation in a safe space, the Shaman uses his training and intuitiveness to identify blocked chakras, energetic and emotional imbalances to create the correct treatment path for the client's session. The Shaman works on multiple planes of existence to help the client realize that they are not emotionally, or spiritually alone to deal with life's great challenges.
