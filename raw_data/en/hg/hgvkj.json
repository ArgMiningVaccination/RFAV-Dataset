In this reality, we're taught to see illness as wrong, viruses as invaders, and disease as a thing that happens when we're unlucky. In this paradigm, we're helpless victims fighting for our lives, which science has shown is actually the very thing that blocks health. What we need isn't a better way to fight, but a new way of understanding what's really going on. Watch this week's episode of MindBody TV where we explored a deeper understanding of what your electromagnetic body is processing during acute illness. We'll also look at why symptoms can flare up when we least expect them, why surrendering to illness is the most powerful way to allow healing, and how your body's intelligence and processes are always in full support of your spiritual expansion!
