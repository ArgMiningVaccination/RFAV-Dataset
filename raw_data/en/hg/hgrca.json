Benefits of Natural Medicine Since natural medicine seeks to treat the root cause of an illness, an appointment with a naturopathic physician may take longer than going to a traditional doctor's office. Relationships are an essential part of our lives, and the doctor-patient connection in holistic therapy is critical. Root causes may not be quickly apparent when the origin could be psychological, physiological, physical or emotional. When the physician and patient are allowed to build a trusting relationship, treatment can be even more impactful. Since some patients may not yet recognize the trigger of their symptoms, it is crucial to seek a naturopathic doctor, such as Dr. Michael R. Smith, ND, BCB. During the initial appointment, we will review the patient's medical history and current condition to find the most effective customized treatment. Naturopathic treatments can offer numerous benefits, such as: - Reduced anxiety - Alleviation of symptoms of depression - Pain relief - Increased relaxation - Improved sleep Naturopathy seeks to achieve balance by stimulating the body's natural healing abilities. Patients are encouraged to educate themselves with the help of their physicians and therapists. In this way, a patient may begin to take control of their health and can work collaboratively with their physician to heal themselves. Understanding Natural Medicine Products from nature and practices used since before there were pharmaceutical drugs are the cornerstone of natural medicine. That does not mean that a naturopathic doctor does not, or cannot, prescribe medications. They have the same medical education as a traditional physician, but the naturopathic practitioner will work to exhaust all-natural options before resorting to prescription medicine wherever possible. Dr. Michael R. Smith, ND, BCB is a naturopathic doctor who focuses on Unlike generic, off-the-shelf treatments and supplements, a naturopathic treatment plan is designed specifically for the individual. We will tailor the dosages of herbal medicine or dietary supplement to the patient's needs. They are intended to treat the root cause that can lead to the condition. The Treatment Process Naturopathic treatment can take many forms. The strategies can differ based on root cause, symptoms and the desired outcome. The types of natural therapies fall into three main categories: natural products, mind/body practices and complementary therapies. Echinacea is a well-known example of a naturopathic product. This herbal treatment derived from purple coneflower has become commonplace in most drug or grocery stores. It is recommended to help boost the body's immune system so that it can more easily fight infection. People can take these herbs can in a capsule, tablet, liquid form or tea form. Popular dietary supplements are glucosamine sulfate, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe), chondroitin and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM). Glucosamine, chondroitin and MSM can work as alternatives to prescriptions in the treatment of arthritis. These are usually available in capsule or tablet form. Achieving a Balanced Lifestyle There are many mind-body connection techniques used as therapy in naturopathy that can be continued indefinitely to maintain balance. Meditation and yoga are examples of practices that can be beneficial for all ages and levels of fitness. Some may find emotional and spiritual peace and harmony with their environment. Balance in all aspects of life is a constant struggle but finding the one that works for you is vital. Some may need an artistic expression to balance their everyday decision making. Laughter and joy can work miracles and adding in some playful or relaxing activities are good ways to maintain balance and health naturally.
