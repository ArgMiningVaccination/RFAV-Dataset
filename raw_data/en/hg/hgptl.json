Ultraprevention Ultraprevention [Mark Hyman](https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Mark-Hyman/1125472) Table of Contents About The Book Healthcare is pulled and shaped by many forces, by drug and insurance companies looking for profits, by politicians in search of votes, and by stressed, overworked physicians who barely have time to talk to you before writing a prescription or packing you off to a specialist. So is anyone interested in keeping you well? Yes. Created by two physicians who both survived catastrophic illness, the Ultraprevention program will work for absolutely everyone\u2014old, young, healthy, sick, or somewhere in between.

Ultraprevention is the new science of staying healthy, an innovative program that shatters the myths of today's \"fix-the-broken-parts\" medicine. These myths\u2014drugs cure disease, genes determine your fate, getting older means aging, fat is a four-letter word\u2014are actually believed by many doctors and are keeping you sick. Ardent general practitioners, Drs. Hyman and Liponis reject the current healthcare system of specialists paid to find something wrong, specialists who don't consider how their \"cure\" for one ailment affects the entire body. Working outside the managed care model at Canyon Ranch in the Berkshires, Hyman and Liponis break free of the vicious quick-fix prescription cycle and formulate a program that identifies and eliminates the cause of disease instead of just masking symptoms. Isolating the source of more than 90 percent of today's most common diseases, from cancer and heart disease to diabetes, stroke, and Alzheimer's, they enumerate the Five Forces of Illness\u2014Sludge (malnutrition), Burnout (impaired metabolism), Heat (inflammation), Waste (impaired detoxification), and Rust (oxidative stress). Through the practice of the six-week Ultraprevention program, you'll learn three simple steps\u2014each only two weeks long\u2014that stop these forces and create a lifetime of good health by removing allergens, infections, and toxins from the body and environment; repairing the body through personalizing nutrition, boosting the immune system, and balancing hormones; and recharging with stress management, sleep restoration, and gentle movement. So stop falling for the myths that make you sick and start Ultraprevention, the powerful plan to get older without aging, to maintain health for all of life.
