This 2000 annual report of the Canadian PaediatricSurveillance Program (CPSP) highlights the many contributions that have resulted in our program's success. The key to the CPSP's strength is the participation of Canadian paediatricians, subspecialists and otherhealth-care providers in the monthly collection of information on rare paediatric conditions. These are our most valued players. Also highly valued are our principal investigators who review and analyze the data collected to provideus with knowledge and educational solutions to help children and youth around the world. The Canadian Association of Paediatric Hospitals, IMPACT (Immunization Monitoring ProgramACTive) centres, Notifiable Diseases ReportingSystem and CJD-Surveillance System Canada deserve a special thank you for their role in the verification of data collected. Our continuedassociation can only bring more credibility to ourcase ascertainment. A sincere thank you goes to the CPSP Steering Committee members. These are the coaches whocontinue to guide the program by providing a wealth of knowledge and leadership while addressing key challenges for the future. Of course a program such as this one cannot function without funding, a summary of which is found in thisreport. We gratefully acknowledge the financial support from all our funders. In closing, we highlight the CPSP partnership between the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) and HealthCanada's Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention andControl (CIDPC). This is not a partnership in name only. The CPS administers the program with very strong intellectual as well as financial support from the CIDPC.CIDPC's participation and commitment have enabled theprogram to grow and disseminate valuable information onuncommon paediatric diseases and conditions.2C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S Message from the Minister of Health As Minister of Health, I commend the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) on its achievements over the past five years. The Program'ssuccess is due, in large part, to the commitment of the paediatricians, geneticists, allergists and other health-care workers who diligently complete and return the monthly 'report card'. As well, the Canadian Paediatric Society must be recognized for its vital role in the day-to-day operation of the CPSP . An essential aspect of the Program is the ability to link information obtained by health-care workers who provide care and treatment to children with rare conditions to those who can use the information to improve the lives of childrenand youth. I congratulate the CPSP on its role in the successful initial meeting of the International Network of Paediatric Surveillance Units held in Ottawa in June 2000. The Network provides a unique mechanism for international collaboration by providing a rich backdrop of diverse geographical locations and population characteristics. This year's Speech from the Throne recognized the importance of children and families. Securing a good start in life for children is the only way to ensure that they are ready to learn, to seize opportunity as adults, and to contribute to the building of their country. The CPSP is an important step to ensuring a good start in life for our children and youth. On behalf of all Canadians, I wish the Program continued success. Allan Rock MinisterHealth Canada 3C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S Message from the Director General, Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control I am pleased to accept the fifth annual report of the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP). This program, designed to monitor andcontribute to the improvement of health of all Canadian children and youth, has resulted in an increased knowledge of uncommon childhood conditions and the practical improvement in prevention and treatment. The surveillance of vaccine-preventable diseases continues to be a particular focus of the program. Canada is a global partner in the W orld HealthOrganization's polio eradication initiative. Until every region in the world is certified polio-free and global eradication is attained, there is a risk of wild poliovirus importation from polio-endemic regions to Canada. Consequently,Canada remains committed to the monitoring of its polio-free status through the CPSP by surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis. Canada is also committed to monitoring the effectiveness of the measles-mumps-rubella immunization program through the CPSP's surveillance of congenital rubellaand subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. Since 1970, the incidence of rubella in Canada has declined markedly; however, there are still reported cases. I would like to thank the staff of the Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control (CIDPC) who form the foundation of the partnership with the Canadian Paediatric Society in the administration of the program. CIDPC is committed to the continuation of the partnership as it builds on the success of the past five years infacilitating communication, cooperation and collaboration among diverse professional disciplines in many nations working toward the well-being of children. I am gratified by the success of the first formal meeting of the International Network of Paediatric Surveillance Units that was hosted by the CPSP in Ottawa in June 2000. International collaboration on surveillance and research is becoming increasingly important as the movement of people across the globe becomescommonplace. I wish to thank the participants, the paediatricians, the allergists, the neurologists, the geneticists and the intensivists, for their dedication to the program. The success of active surveillance is due to the large number of participants who return the monthly reporting form. A healthy Canadian society is built on the health and well-being of individual Canadians and the health of our communities. Programs, such as the CPSP , provide the building blocks for the health of our children, youth and their families, and of our future generations. Paul Gully A/Director GeneralCentre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control 4C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S Message from the President of the Canadian Paediatric Society For the past five years, Canadian paediatricians, paediatric subspecialists and health-care providers have actively participated in surveillance of rare diseases and conditions of public health importance through the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP), a partnership program betweenthe Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) and Health Canada's Centre forInfectious Disease Prevention and Control. There are many important reasons why we participate in this program. Timely epidemiological prospective data collection has a direct impact on thediagnosis and treatment of patients. Surveillance of rare genetic conditionsmay identify populations at risk, which, in turn, may lead to implementationof population-based screening programs. Such programs allow for interventionat younger ages, thereby improving quality of life. Data collection can monitorthe incidence of disease before vaccination as well as the effectiveness ofimmunization programs. Hemorrhagic disease of the newborn study results have supported the Canadian Paediatric Society's guidelines on the administration of intramuscular vitamin K to newborn babies. Increased awareness and earlier diagnosisof a treatable inherited disease such as Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, will improve the general health,behaviour and quality of life of affected patients and their families. The rarity of subacute sclerosingpanencephalitis (SSPE) cases (two in four years) is both a tribute to the success of the measles immunizationprogram, as well as reassurance about the safety of the measles vaccine. The CPSP is also a valuable educational resource. Study protocols and associated educational articles offer a great way to acquire Maintenance of Certification credits. Under the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeonsof Canada (RCPSC) classification entitled \"Structured learning projects\" (Section 4), physicians can earn onecredit per hour, with no maximum when they document the question, its source, references and the practicaloutcome of learning. Moreover, specific resource articles are developed and distributed, where appropriate, such as the article on the treatment of cerebral edema in diabetic ketoacidosis, for posting in paediatric and community hospitalemergency rooms to improve recognition and management. The first CPSP highlight on the value of collectingstool cultures for surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis was published in the November/December issue ofPaediatrics & Child Health . CPSP highlights will become a monthly feature in 2001. Pan-Canadian analysis and summary data is published in the annual CPSP Results and upon completion of a study in peer-reviewedjournals and at scientific meetings. The list of CPSP publications and presentations is growing (see pages 7-8). W e, at the CPS, firmly believe that our continued diligent participation in our national surveillance system will bring further knowledge and educational solutions that will benefit children and youth around the world.Thank you for your support of this important program. David F . Smith, MD, FRCPC President, Canadian Paediatric Society 5C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S CPSP Chairman's Report On this fifth anniversary, the CPSP is getting closer to its ascertainment response rate goal of 90%. The CPSP Working Group and SteeringCommittee are committed to developing new ways of sharing informationto showcase the value of active surveillance and keep participants interestedand engaged in the program. As a result, we can now lay claim to animpressive 95% response rate for detailed case reporting, a truly impressiveachievement in light of the nearly 830 cases reported. Participants are stronglyencouraged to report all known cases, even if they suspect they may beduplicates. Case ascertainment is monitored and verified by investigatingduplicate reports and comparing data with other existing programs andcentres. Duplication of case reports is both expected and valued. With increased concerns about the protection of individual privacy, an important issue for paediatric surveillance becomes the need to balance the goal of data collection forthe common good against the need for confidentiality. The CPSP is committed to maintaining patientconfidentiality. Only non-nominal patient information, such as the date of birth and sex of the child, as well ascomments on the condition, is requested for each reported case. This information is used to identify duplicatesand serve as a reminder on the detailed report form to request case-specific information. At the most recent Steering Committee meeting, Mr. Paul Muirhead, a lawyer with specialization in biomedical ethics, and Dr. Michael Y eo, Ethicist of the Canadian Medical Association and Adjunct Professorat the University of Ottawa, led an ethics workshop where various ethical issues were discussed. While health-related surveillance has existed for centuries, the difference today is the rapidly increasing technologicalability to link, analyze and spread data. The CPSP renewed its commitment to ensuring the privacy and thenon-labelling of individuals, localities, and provinces involved in either rare encounters of a condition orlocalized outbreaks. Only pan-national data is used in presentations and publication of study results. Being a member of the International Network of Paediatric Surveillance Units (INoPSU) provides remarkable opportunities for international collaboration and data comparison. One CPSP study likely to come on streamin 2001 is CHARGE association/syndrome (CAS). Children with CAS have variable combinations ofabnormalities, including coloboma, choanal atresia and cardiac, renal, genital and gastrointestinalabnormalities. As this condition is currently under study in Australia, the CPSP anticipates a valuableexchange of knowledge in the foreseeable future. I urge you to read this year's study results. The successes, achieved by your participation and support of the CPSP , speak for themselves. Our challenge for 2001 will be to reach a response rate of 90% for both initialand detailed reporting. A sincere 'thank you' to those who have worked so hard to establish and promote this active surveillance program. The past five years have resulted in considerable support and acceptance. Participation of adedicated paediatric community, the guidance of the Steering Committee, the exceptional efforts of theW orking Group and support of Health Canada's Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control havemade a bright future possible.

Funding Funding for the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) is divided into two categories: corefunding and study funding. Core funding Core funding covers administrative costs pertaining to the program including the salary of a full-timeprogram coordinator, a part-time administrative assistant, as well as part salaries for administrative andfinancial support. The Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Health Canada, provides this core funding. Study funding The CPSP provides researchers with a very inexpensive, timely and effective means of first identifying and then obtaining follow-up data on rare conditions and diseases. Researchers and principal investigators interested in initiating new studies are encouraged to make early contact with the Program Coordinator to discuss the services provided by the program (see T able 3,page 13). While researchers are expected to obtain funding for their studies, the CPSP is more than willing to work with individual researchers to secure funding.9C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S Funding Sources The CPSP gratefully acknowledges funding for studies in 2000 from the following: Government departments, Health Canada: Acute flaccid paralysis CIDPC, Population & Public Health Branch Anaphylaxis Food Directorate, Health Products and Food Branch Congenital rubella syndrome CIDPC, Population & Public Health Branch Hemolytic uremic syndrome CIDPC, Population & Public Health Branch Hemorrhagic disease of the newborn CIDPC, Population & Public Health Branch Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection CIDPC, Population & Public Health Branch Progressive intellectual and neurological CIDPC, Population & Public Health Branch deterioration Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis CIDPC, Population & Public Health Branch CIDPC = Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Non-governmental sources: Canadian Allergy, Asthma and Immunology FoundationAnaphylaxis Cerebral edema in diabetic ketoacidosisSmith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome10C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S How the CPSP Works Criteria considered for inclusion of studiesTABLE 1 Rarity Public health importance Scientific importanceUniqueness Quality of proposalWorkload of paediatriciansDisorders of such low incidence or prevalence that national ascertainment of cases is needed (less than 1,000 cases a year). Clearly addressing a public or paediatric health issue.Demonstrated scientific interest and importance.Proposal must demonstrate a clear need for data on a condition or disorder for which there is only limited information and for which surveillance is the most appropriate means of collecting the data. Proposal must state clear and achievable objectives, practicability, patient confidentiality, adequate resources, clear questionnaire and method of evaluation. Steering Committee must be convinced that reporting will not make excessive additional demands on the workload of paediatricians. Priority will be given to diseases that are not currently notifiable or, if notifiable, have sufficient indication of under-not ification. Investigators are expected to demonstrate that potential funding is available.The difficulty in recognizing rare disease can result in delayed diagnosis, increasing the riskof preventable complications or death. Emerging infections will initially be rare and may remain undetected allowing infection tospread extensively before action is taken. All such diseases are difficult to study as their low frequency often means that little may beknown about their etiology, clinical spectrum, sequelae, pathological features, diagnosis, treatment and management. Data collectionfrom a large and often geographically diverse population is required to generate a sufficient number of cases to derive meaningful data. The Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program was instituted to enable the collection of national epidemiological data in the study of rare diseases of Canadian children and youth.More than 2,300 paediatricians have been enrolled as participants in this active surveillance system. Other participants, suchas paediatric neurologists, allergists, medical geneticists and intensivists are enrolled in theprogram when research studies indicate their participation. These physicians provide health care to over six million Canadian children andyouth. Selection of studies The Steering Committee selects studies forinclusion in the program through consideringthe criteria outlined in T able 1. Study proposals can be submitted at any time through the Program Coordinator and should follow the format in T able 2. The Steering Committee reviews submissions at its spring andfall meetings, giving preference to studies that have either strong public health importance or could not be undertaken any other way, and for which a funding source is clearly identified. Individual researchers are encouraged to makeearly contact with the Program Coordinator to11C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S discuss the appropriateness of the program for collecting the data, to define the costs, and to identify possible funding agencies. See T able 3for a summary of services provided. The CPSP is willing to provide limited help in obtaining funds, and assistance in coordinatingarrangements for funding. Studies must be submitted to an ethical review board for approval before receiving final acceptance tothe program. Reporting methodology The CPSP uses a two-tiered reporting processto ascertain and investigate cases: an initial'check-off' form and a detailed reporting form. The full process is summarized in Figure 1. Initial reporting The initial reporting form (Figure 2), listingthe conditions currently under surveillance, isFormat for submissionTABLE 2 Proposals for new studies should include: name of principal author brief abstract of proposal proposed starting date proposed duration question(s) to be addressed by study statement of justification, including how the information could be used case definition expected number of cases availability of ethical approval (state source of approval) funding arrangements identification of projected date for completion of analysis and submission for publication FIGURE 1 Reporting process summarymailed monthly to practising Canadian paediatricians and relevant paediatric subspecialists and health-care providers.Respondents are asked to indicate, against each condition, the number of new cases seen in the last month, including nil reports,as the CPSP cannot simply assume that no reply means no cases. Forms are returned to the CPSP office in a postage-paid envelope. Participants are encouraged to report all cases meeting the case definitions that cometo their attention. If in doubt about whether or not to report, it is best to do so. This sometimes leads to duplicate reports butavoids missed cases. Duplicates are identified during case follow-up. The CPSP needs to hear back from all participants, whether they have seen a new case or not. Even a 'nothing to report' response is vital in assuring completeness of case ascertainment by12C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S helping the CPSP reach its goal of 90% response. Quarterly reminders are mailed to respondents whohave not replied for all months of the year. These reminders have greatly improvedresponse rates and the ascertainment of cases. T o keep participants informed ofprogress, monthly compliance rates and the number of cases reported are mailed quarterlyto all participants. Follow-up and confirmation of case reports For each study initiated through the CPSP , program participants receive a summaryof the protocol, including the case definition and brief description of the condition.In addition to providing a uniform basis for reporting, this approach serves toeducate and increase awareness of unusual or rare conditions. While non-nominal patient information, such as the dateof birth and sex of the child, as well as comments on the condition are requested foreach reported case, the CPSP assures the confidentiality of all information provided to theprogram. This information isFIGURE 2 used to identify duplicates and is entered, as a reminder, on a detailedreport form, which is sent to the original respondent to request case-specificinformation. The detailed report is returned to the CPSP when completed and then forwarded to the investigator for analysis. The investigator is responsible for contacting the respondent if further information is required.The detailed report forms are developed by the investigator and must receive Steering Committee and ethical approval before use.Current CPSP monthly reporting form 13C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S Summary of services provided by the CPSP to researchersTABLE 3 High case ascertainment: goal of over 90% response from more than 2,300 participants Very inexpensive means of identifying and obtaining data on rare diseases and conditions Active surveillance: participants complete the check-off form each month, indicating newcases or 'nothing to report' Timely surveillance: a mail-out each month to all participants All administrative servicesHigh response rate: follow-up reminders to participants who have not responded Timely feedback of results to participants: quarterly summary reports Full-time program coordinatorAccess to a CPSP consultant (Medical Affairs Officer) Full vetting of research proposals by the CPSP Steering Committee Annual surveillance summaries, authored by each researcher, published in the CPSP Results Presentation of surveillance summary/results at the Steering Committee meetings - opportunityfor discussion Opportunity for international collaboration with other paediatric surveillance units worldwide The chance to make a difference in the health and well-being of Canadian children and youth Increased awareness of rare paediatric conditions among the health-care community Existence of an effective surveillance system, should a new public health issue ariseValidation of case ascertainment Multiple checks and balances are in place to confirm the overall quality and reliability ofCPSP data.

AFP surveillance is contributing to the documentation of global polio eradication necessary to be able to discontinue systematic polio vaccination in the foreseeable future. In 2000, as in the previous year, the AFP study met the internationally targeted rateof one AFP case per 100,000 children under 15 years of age expected to occur in theabsence of wild polio. Canada continues to contribute to the better understanding of the neuropathological manifestations of AFP in children in a polio-free environment. Dr. Paul Varughese Summary Fifty-seven confirmed acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases, with a mean age of six years, werereported to the CPSP in 2000; the rate (0.97 per100,000) is almost equivalent to the minimum estimated background rate of one case per 100,000 population less than 15 years of age.The number of cases in 2000 represents a 32.5%increase over the number of cases reported for1998, but is 3% less than in 1999. As in previousyears, the majority (46 cases or 80.7%) of cases were diagnosed as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), followed by transverse myelitis (4 casesor 7.0%).Background The elimination of indigenous wild poliovirus transmission in Canada, and the rest of the American Region, was certified in September 1994. However, until global polio eradication isattained there remains an ongoing risk of wild poliovirus importation from polio-endemic regions to Canada. Consequently, activesurveillance of AFP in children less than 15 years old is used to monitor potential cases of paralytic poliomyelitis. Based on an estimatedbackground annual incidence of one case per 100,000 population less than 15 years of age in the absence of wild poliovirus transmission, 1 the estimated minimum number of AFP cases in Canada is 59 cases per year. AFP surveillance in Canada was initiated in 1991 through the IMPACT (Immunization Monitoring Program ACTive) network of paediatric tertiary carecentres, and, since 1996, has been implemented through the CPSP . This report presents the results of AFP surveillance in 2000 andcompares them to those from previous years. Objective The objective of AFP surveillance is to identify AFP cases (including GBS) in children less than 15 years of age to rule out paralytic poliomyelitis and thereby monitor the polio-free status of Canada. Case definition Acute onset of focal weakness or paralysis characterized as flaccid (reduced tone) without other obvious cause (e.g., trauma) in children less than 15 years of age. T ransient weakness(e.g., post-ictal weakness) should not bereported.16C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S Duration January 1996 to December 2004 Methods Surveillance is based on reporting by paediatricians and active monitoring of hospital admissions to the 12 IMPACT centres. Paediatricians submit initial monthly reportsof the number of cases seen followed by detailed reports of case-specific information using a standardized reporting form. AFP cases detected through IMPACT are also reported to the CPSPusing the same reporting form.

Of the remaining 57 confirmed AFP cases, 41 (71.9%) were males and 16 (28.1%) were females. The cases ranged in age from five months to 14.3 years (median 5.4, mean 6.0years). T able 4 shows the age distribution of AFPcases reported in 2000 compared with casesreported from 1996 to 1999. Overall, the agedistribution is similar throughout the reporting period. Polio vaccination status : In 2000, only 40 cases (70%) had documentation for having received any polio vaccination; for the remaining 17 cases, no polio vaccine-specific informationwas available on the case report form. Of these40 cases assessed, 34 (85%) had receivedage-appropriate polio immunization. Virological investigation for polio or other enteroviruses : A total of 29 (50.9%) cases had stool examination; virology was not done or the status was unknown for 28 (49.1%) cases. However, adequate stool investigation for the isolation of poliovirus or non-polio enteroviruses (i.e., stool specimen collected within two weeks of the onset of paralysis) was reported only for 26 (45.6% of 57) cases (for three additional cases, although stool specimens were collected, it was after two weeks of onset of paralysis); none were positive for polioviruses, but one had 'enterovirus' and one had 'echoviruses'. None of the nine throat and/or cerebrospinal fluidspecimens collected for viral isolation was positive for poliovirus. For three cases, serological investigations were done: for one case, paired serological tests for polio-specific antibody titres were performed, but were negative for poliovirus infection (titresless than 1:10); for the second case, only a single titre was done, but the result was inconclusive (titre less than 1:10), and for the third case, theresult was not available. Neurological investigations consisted of at least one of the following: nerve conduction studies, electromyography, MRI, or CT scan; abnormal findings compatible with the neurologicaldiagnosis were reported for one or more of the tests done for 43 (75.4%) cases. Electromyography and/or nerve conductionstudies were done for 40 cases; 36 (90%) of these cases had abnormal findings. For 31 cases in which MRI or CT scanning was done,10 were reported as abnormal. The final neurological diagnosis was reported as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in 46 cases (80.7%) and transverse myelitis in four (7.0%) (T able 5).The remaining seven diagnoses included viralmyelitis (1), 3rd cranial nerve palsy (1),hypotonic acute areflexia (1), acutedemyelination (bulbar and lumbar) (1), 10th cranial nerve palsy (1), anterior horn disease (non-polio) (1), and demyelinatingpolyneuropathy (1). Fifty-six of the 57 cases (98.2%) required hospitalization for periods ranging from one to over 60 days (mean, 10 days); three cases were hospitalised for 30 days or longer. Of the total of 57 cases, nine (15.8%) were fully recovered at 60 days after the onset of paralysis, nine (15.8%) had recovered partially with residual weakness, and one (1.7%) had a stable or progressive18C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S condition. For the remaining 38 cases, recovery status was unknown at 60 days after the onset of paralysis. Discussion The 57 AFP cases identified to date for 2000 indicate that the surveillance system continues tobe sensitive enough to detect almost all expectedcases in Canada, according to the WHO criteria, for the non-polio AFP cases in the targeted population (children under 15 years) in theabsence of circulation of wild poliovirus. For thecorresponding period for 1999, a total of 59 casesreported initially, but the final number hasincreased to 61 with the inclusion of two additional cases reported in 2000. It is encouraging to note that the AFP reporting rate has improved since the introduction ofpaediatrician-based reporting through the CPSPfrom 0.5 per 100,000 children less than 15 yearsin 1996 (30 cases) to 0.97 per 100,000 in 2000(57 cases). It also supports previous observations that the expansion of AFP surveillance to the CPSP has improved the completeness ofsurveillance by ensuring that AFP cases seen atnon-tertiary hospitals are reported in addition tothose cases admitted to paediatric tertiary carehospitals and reported through IMPACT . None of the clinical specimens tested, i.e., stool, nasopharyngeal or cerebrospinal fluids, were positive for poliovirus infection. Also significant is the fact that in 2000, as in 1999, the CPSP was able to maintain the 100%return rate of detailed case-specific information forms for all AFP cases. The return rate was 79% in 1996, 96% in 1997 and 97% in 1998. Althoughduplicate reporting remains relatively high, in many instances duplicate reports provided additional information not included in the\"primary\" report, thereby proving to be very useful. Thus, all participating paediatricians,paediatric neurologists and IMPACT monitors are still encouraged to submit detailed reportingforms even when they suspect a case to be a potential duplicate, unless there is a clear indication that the information reported wouldbe the same (e.g., where there is a designated reporter among a group of paediatricians in the same practice).

Anaphylaxis occurred more commonly in the child's home thananywhere else, and foods, especially peanut, were by far the most frequently reported triggerAnaphylaxis Highlights Injection of epinephrine, the first-aid treatment of choice in anaphylaxis, was often delayed or omitted. Foods, especially peanut, were the most commonly-reported trigger factor foranaphylaxis. Most children experiencing severe acute allergic reactions also had other allergic disorders, including asthma.factor. Non-food triggers included latex rubber, insect stings, exercise, medications and biologicals. First-aid treatment commonlyconsisted of oral diphenhydramine (Benadryl\u00ae) or another antihistamine. Epinephrine injection was delayed or omitted in many children. Thanks to the excellent cooperation of all reporting physicians in the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program, the picture of anaphylaxis in Canadian children and youth is being defined. This will eventually lead to improved recognition and treatment of the disorder. Case definition A confirmed case is an infant or child 18 years or less with a severe allergic reaction to any stimulus having sudden onset and lasting less than 24 hours. One or more body systems may be involved and multiple symptoms such ashives, flushing, angioedema, stridor, wheezing, shortness of breath, vomiting, diarrhea or shock may be evident. 1) Provoking factors: foods, insect stings/ bites, latex rubber, medications, exercise, cold, or other stimuli. 2) Symptoms: cutaneous, respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and/or central nervous system involvement. 3) Documentation: at the time of the episode: clinical history, physical examination, and serum tryptaselevels, if available; weeks or months after the episode : skin tests for hypersensitivity to food, insectstings/bites, latex, medications; tests for other provoking factors. Duration January 2000 to June 2001Editiorial Note: This summary presents a preliminary description of the findings. A full reportwill be forthcoming, pending a detailed analysis of the study data. Anaphylaxis, defined as a severe acute allergic reaction, is surprisingly common in Canadianinfants, children and teens.

The mortality rate of 20% in confirmed cases is significant. The change in case definition to include patients with a profoundly depressed level of consciousness at initial presentation of DKA has allowed more complete capture of cases and accounts for 33% of all reports. Surveillance will continue until June 2001. Following this, a case-control studyHighlights In the year 2000, 10 confirmed and three possible cases of cerebral edema in diabetic ketoacidosis were reported. During the first 18 months of the study, three deaths were reported out of 15 confirmed cases. Cerebral edema in DKA does occur in some patients prior to initiation oftreatment for DKA.Cerebral edema in diabetic ketoacidosis The broadening of the case definition has resulted in a more completeascertainment of cases. Dr. Elizabeth Cummings21C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S with detailed chart review is planned to establish risk factors for CE-DKA. Background Cerebral edema is an uncommon but devastating complication of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in the paediatric age group. When it occurs, the rates of mortality or survival with permanent neurologicaldamage are high. 1 Most studies have failed to clearly establish risk factors for cerebral edema, although it is often attributed to factorsrelated to treatment of DKA. A recent large case-control study suggested that the risk of CE-DKA was associated with factors atpresentation as well as treatment factors. 2 In this study, CE-DKA occurred more often in patients with lower pCO2 and higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at presentation, when the serum sodium failed to rise during treatment and when bicarbonate was given. The aim of this study is toidentify the frequency of this condition in Canada. Through a case-control study, risk factors for CE-DKA will be identified and used to develop amodified treatment regimen for DKA. Objectives 1. T o determine the incidence of cerebral edema in association with DKA. 2. T o identify risk factors for cerebral edema in association with DKA. 3. T o determine the outcome of cerebral edema in association with DKA. Case definition A. Inclusion criteria Children up to their 16th birthday. Sudden or unexpected deterioration in level of consciousness in a child or adolescent with DKA* Any death in a child or adolescent with T ype 1 or 2 diabetes, either during or unrelated to an episode of DKA. B. Exclusion criteria Deterioration in level of consciousness associated with hypoglycemia and responsive to glucose administration. Duration July 1999 to June 2001 Results Of the 27 reports received in the year 2000 (T able 6), 10 were confirmed cases of cerebral edema in DKA based on data provided in the detailed report forms and three were eitherpossible cases or are awaiting confirmation. Eight were duplicate reports and five did not meet the entry criteria due to the age of the patient or thedate of the event. One report of death in a child with diabetes was not associated with DKA. Eight of the 10 (80%) confirmed cases occurred inpatients with newly diagnosed diabetes. Cases of CE-DKA reported to the CPSP July 1999 to December 2000TABLE 6 Status * Includes cases of death: 2 (2000), 1 (1999), 3 (Total) Excluded due to age (1) or date of event prior to July 1999 (6)Number of reports Confirmed CE-DKA* Possible CE-DKA Did not meet entry criteria Duplicates Death not DKA27 10 35 8 12000 13 52 2 401999 40 15 5 7 12 1Total * DKA is defined as a pH <7.35 and/or bicarbonate <18 mmol/L in association with diabetes and ketonuria.22C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S For the 15 confirmed reports to date, the mean age (SD) was 8.2 (4.5) years with a relatively equal sex distribution of eight malesand seven females. At DKA presentation, the median pCO 2 was 22 mmHg, bicarbonate 5.5 mmol/L and glucose 54 mmol/L. T enhad an acute deterioration in level of consciousness one to six hours after initiation of treatment and six of these had CT scans.Five had CE suspected at initial presentation of DKA due to a profoundly depressed level of consciousness, with four confirmed byCT scan. With three deaths associated with cerebral edema in DKA, the mortality rate for confirmed cases was 20%. Nine recovered fully and two are neurologically impaired (one unspecified). One death was reported in a child with diabetes but was not associated with DKA. The cause of this death wasunclear. Discussion The number of reports of CE-DKA to the CPSP continues to be consistent with the estimated rates prior to the start of the study. The mortality rate in confirmed cases isconsistent with results found in a recent multi-centre case-control study. 2 Most of the remaining cases were reported to have a fullrecovery. This finding needs to be confirmed in the chart review but suggests that prognosis of survivors may not be as pooras was previously reported. 1 After review of reports from the first six months of surveillance, the inclusion criteria were revised to include patients with a profoundly depressed level of consciousness at initial presentation of DKA. This changeproved to be valuable, as 33% of the confirmed cases presented in this way. This rate is much higher than previously reported and has implications for the pathophysiology of CE-DKA, which is controversial but is often attributed to medical treatment. In patients presenting with DKA and profound depression in level of consciousness, the presence of CE should be suspected. Imaging studies may be helpful to confirm the diagnosis. After two years of surveillance, extensive chart reviews with case controls are plannedto determine factors associated with CE-DKA. Sincere thanks to all those who have reported cases. This ongoing collaboration that willcontinue into a chart review process is greatlyappreciated. References 1. Rosenbloom AL.

Since 1996, IMPACT cases havebeen forwarded to the CPSP . Paediatricianssurveyed in the CPSP were also asked to reportnewborns with laboratory-confirmed rubellainfection (CRI) without obvious manifestations at birth. Objectives 1. T o estimate the incidence of congenital rubella syndrome and congenital rubellainfection in Canada. 2. T o obtain detailed epidemiological data, including maternal histories, on reported cases of congenital rubella syndrome andinfection. Case definitions Confirmed case Live birth T wo clinically compatible manifestations (any combination from T able 7, columns A and B)with laboratory confirmation of infection: isolation of rubella virus from an appropriate clinical specimen; or detection of rubella-specific IgM in the absence of recent immunization with rubella- containing vaccine; or rubella-specific IgG persisting at elevated levels for longer than would be expected frompassive transfer of maternal antibody, or in theabsence of recent immunization. Stillbirth T wo clinically compatible manifestations with isolation of rubella virus from an appropriateclinical specimen.Background In Canada, rubella immunization programs were introduced in the 1970s. However, the programstrategies varied; some provinces initially opted forselective immunization of pre-adolescent females and others opted for immunization of all infants. By 1983, all provinces and territories acrossCanada had implemented routine measles-mumps-rubella combined vaccine (MMR) at 12 months.During 1996 and 1997, all provinces andterritories introduced a routine second dose MMR or measles-rubella combined vaccine (MR) given at 18 months or four to six years. Somejurisdictions used MR vaccine for their seconddose catch-up campaigns. Since 1970, the incidence of rubella in Canada has declined markedly; fewer than 50 cases werereported annually in the past two years. During anational consensus conference in 1994, a goal of eliminating indigenous rubella infection during pregnancy by the year 2000 was established. In Canada, passive reporting of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) to the Notifiable DiseasesReporting System (NDRS) began in 1979. ActiveCongenital rubella syndrome Highlights Only one infant born with congenital rubella syndrome was reported to the CPSP in 2000. Failure to screen the mother in the first pregnancy led to a missed opportunity of postpartum vaccination and prevention. Both rubella and congenital rubella have been virtually eliminated in Canada, thanks to the successful immunization program. Dr. Paul Varughese24C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S Note : The following cannot be classified as a CRS case: rubella antibody titre absent in the infant;or rubella absent in the mother; or rubella antibody titre declining in the infant consistent with the normal decline after birth of passively transferred maternal antibody.

Duration January 1996 to December 2004 Methods From January 1996 to December 2000, physicians or IMPACT investigators reportingCRS and CRI cases through the CPSP were asked to complete detailed report forms. If more than one physician reported on a particular case,the information from all case report forms was reviewed and collated. Provincial/territorial public health authorities were consulted todetermine if cases had been previously reported. Results In 2000, the CPSP reported a total of threecases, including one newborn (confirmed) andtwo older children, aged nine years and 15 years, both with late manifestations of CRS (discarded). However, during the same period, * Clinical illness is characterized by fever and rash, and at least one of the following: arthralgia/arthritis, lymphadenopathy, conjunctivitis. Up to 50% of rubella infections are reported to be subclinical.25C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S two newborn cases with CRS were reported to the NDRS, including the one identified by the CPSPand a second case currently being investigated. This report summarizes the findings of the one case reported to the CPSP . The infant was born with patent ductus jaundice, transientthrombocytopenia, and Wilms' tumor. Rubella virus was cultured from the baby's throat and urine specimens collected 13 days after birth.Persisting rubella-specific IgG was present butwas negative for rubella-specific IgM. The Canadian-born mother previously delivered a healthy child in a hospital (rural) setting.Rubella vaccination status of the motheris unknown and she doesn't ever recall having received any rubella vaccine, including at the time of the first postpartum hospital discharge, orhaving had any rubella screening. She does notrecall having any contact with a rubella case orhaving any symptoms compatible with rubelladuring pregnancy. Discussion The 2000 case history indicates that the mother did not have any rubella vaccination and was susceptible to rubella even during her firstpregnancy; fortunately, she was not exposed torubella at that time. It appears that no screeningfor rubella susceptibility was done during thehealth care visits or any rubella immunization offered at any time before the second pregnancy, including just before the postpartum hospitaldischarge. Since rubella transmission in thegeneral population has been on the decline,secondary to successful rubella vaccination, onlyvery limited naturally acquired immunity due to wild virus infection is present. Rubella vaccination before pregnancy is the only measure to protectthe fetus from potential maternal infection.The very low incidence of CRS, CRI and rubella infection suggests that Canada is getting closer to achieving the goal of eliminating indigenous rubella infection during pregnancy. From January 1996 to December 2000, with national surveillance in place, seven new cases of newborns with CRS were reported in Canada(T able 8). T wo were born to immigrant woman, one to an aboriginal woman, and two to non- aboriginal women. These five cases illustrate theneed for documentation of previously received rubella vaccination, of maternal immunity status, and postpartum rubella vaccine when indicated. Health care providers are requested to ensure that all women without documented proof of rubella immunization receive the vaccine. Special attention should be given to the review ofvaccination records of women from regions with poor vaccination coverage, including women in immigrant populations. Routine rubella antibodyscreening antenatally is central to the congenital rubella prevention strategy and all women found to be susceptible should be vaccinated in theimmediate postpartum period. Standing orders for vaccination of susceptible women before discharge from hospital is the most effective wayto ensure that the opportunity is not missed. The degree of under-diagnosis and under- reporting for CRI, CRS with less severe manifestations and CRS with delayed-onsetmanifestations is unknown. So far, no cases of CRI have been reported to the CPSP . Physicians are reminded that it is important to investigate allinfants born to mothers who have confirmed or suspected rubella infection during pregnancy, even if the infants have no obvious abnormalitieson examination. Prenatal rubella screening and postpartum vaccination will continue to be essential in our quest to eliminate rubellainfection during pregnancy.26C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S Background Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is one of the leading causes of acute renal failure in manydeveloped countries, including Canada. 1 Most commonly HUS is associated with prodromalsymptoms, including diarrhea, bloody stools and vomiting. Cases may occur singly or in outbreaks, in families or linked to specific events related toingestion of contaminated food or water. Forexample, a waterborne outbreak in Ontario in thesummer of 2000 resulted in over 2000 cases ofE. coli and Campylobacter infection. V erotoxin- producing E. coli (VTEC) infection in a number of cases was associated with development ofHUS. 2 VTEC is frequently associated with HUS. However, HUS may also occur withneuraminidase-producing pathogens such asAcknowledgements W e would like to thank all participating paediatricians, IMPACT nurse monitors and investigators for their contribution to the congenital rubella surveillance program.Special thanks to Ms. Catherine Guimond who provided additional information on the current case.

S. pneumoniae associated HUS (SPAH) has a significantly higher mortality rate in children than HUS with diarrhea.3 Paediatricians participating in the surveillance program report cases of HUS with prodromaldiarrhea (HUS D+) and without diarrhea(HUS D -). All detailed case reports were reviewed and cases fulfilling the D+ and D - case definitions were included in the study. Objectives 1. T o determine the incidence of HUS D+, including illness caused by E. coli O157:H7 and other VTEC serotypes. 2. T o determine the incidence of invasive SPAH. Case definitions HUS D+ Diarrhea associated with HUS: A prodrome of enteric symptoms in a child under16 years of age with: * microangiopathic malignant hypertension,chronic uremia, collagen or vascular disorders.These criteria may not all be present simultaneouslyand may be accompaniedby neurological impairment.

Duration April 2000 to March 2002 Methods Paediatricians participating in the CPSP are requestedto report all cases of HUS, with or without prodromalenteric symptoms. All case reports are reviewed todetermine whether they fulfill the case definitions forHUS D+ or D -. Detailed review is particularly important where all components of the casedefinitions are not met simultaneously or where theresults of diagnostic tests lie just outside the definitionthreshold. Duplicates are removed and all cases underreview retain pending status until HUS is confirmed. Results During the first eight months of the study for which reports have been received, a total of 122 initialreports of HUS were received. This total included 76(62%) that were confirmed as HUS D+, 34 that wereduplicates and six that did not meet the HUS case definition.

Of the 76 confirmed cases, 35 were males and 41 were females. No reports of S. pneumoniae HUS were received during this period. Detailed reports were received for 61 cases ranging in age from seven months to 15 years(T able 9). Over half the cases were aged one to four years and almost a third were in the five to nine years age group (median age was threeyears seven months). Fifty-nine cases presented with symptoms of diarrhea, including 52 with bloody diarrhea.T wo confirmed cases did not record diarrheaas a presenting symptom: for one of these cases,information on diarrhea was not stated; forthe other case that was negative, the patient presented with vomiting only. A total of 17 children required dialysis; 10 cases wereevaluated for long-term renal impairment andthree children were being treated for othersequelae of HUS. T wo of the 61 confirmedcases died, 42 cases had a pathogen identified. Of the 40 E. coli isolates identified, 39 were identified as E. coli O157, of which 16 were identified as E. coli O157:H7. Summary The number of confirmed cases reported during the first eight months of the study is slightlyhigher than expected. This may be explained bya large cluster associated with a waterborneoutbreak in Ontario in the summer of 2000. Thehigh proportion of cases aged one to four yearsand the median age (three years seven months)is consistent with previous reports. 4 Finally, during this eight-month study period, all caseswere classified as HUS D+ and E. coli O157 was the predominant pathogen identified.

Early HDNB, occurring within the first 24 hours of life, is uncommon and usually occurs in babies born to mothers taking drugs that impair vitamin K metabolism (e.g., anticonvulsants, antituberculous medications). Classical HDNB (occurring in the first week of life) is rarely seen when vitamin K is appropriately given to newborn infants. Late HDNB (three to eight weeks of age) occurs primarily in breastfedbabies with limited oral intake of vitamin K. It may be associated with death or neurologic sequelae in 50% of the babies in which this occurs. In 1997, the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) and the College of Family Physicians ofCanada published revised guidelines on the administration of vitamin K to newborn babies. 1 Based on concerns from Germany, Britain, Sweden, and Australia that the use of oral vitamin K may be associated with increased incidence of late HDNB, the CPSrecommends that intramuscular vitamin K be the usual standard for newborn babies following birth. Objective Inclusion of HDNB in the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program helps to identify the incidence of HDNB in the Canadianpopulation and the relationship of vitamin K administration following birth. This will assist in assessing the impact of CPSrecommendations in this area. Case definition Abnormal bleeding in the first three months oflife associated with an abnormal prothrombin time of >18 seconds or an INR (international normalized ratio) of >1.4 without otherabnormalities of coagulation or explained by another diagnosis of liver, bowel, or systemic disease. Duration January 1997 to December 2000 Methods The program coordinator or the principalinvestigator follows up reports to the CPSP with requests for further information to confirm or refute the diagnosis of HDNB.Hemorrhagic disease of the newborn may occur when no vitamin K is given and is potentially lethal orpermanently disabling. Dr. Douglas McMillanHemorrhagic disease of the newborn Highlights One baby with hemorrhagic disease of the newborn who did not receive vitamin K prophylaxis was reported in 2000. With only five confirmed cases in four years, this study reinforces the effectiveness of the CPS guidelines of routine administration of vitamin K to newborns.30C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S Results Of the four reports received in 2000, one baby with HDNB was an unplanned home birth at36 weeks gestation who was then admitted tohospital for a two-week stay. The baby wasbreastfed and presented at 31 days of life with intracranial bleeding (left parietal hemorrhagic infarct, intraventricular hemorrhage).Coagulation profile was compatible withHDNB. The baby who had not receivedvitamin K following birth has been left with\"extensive brain damage\". Of the remaining reports, one was a duplicate of the first case and another was a late report for1998. A third baby was felt not to have HDNBafter presenting with gastric bleeding (laterevidence of gastric hemangiomas) and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. A poster report of HDNB to the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program 1997 to 1999was presented at the 2000 annual meeting of theCanadian Paediatric Society. 2 Conclusions were: In spite of detailed instructions, HDNB is often confused with hemolytic disease of the newborn. (This is probably why the follow-up British study is called vitamin K deficiency bleeding.) Diagnosis of HDNB is often made without coagulation studies or with studies not compatible with vitamin K deficiency. The incidence of HDNB in Canada appears to be one in 140,000 to one in 170,000 births. In Canada, HDNB most often presents with intracranial bleeding that may have serious sequelae. Not all babies in Canada receive vitamin K following birth; the relative incidence of HDNB in babies given intramuscular versus oral vitamin K is not distinguishable.Conclusions One report of HDNB was confirmed in a baby who was born at home at 36 weeks gestation and subsequently cared for in hospital with novitamin K prophylaxis. HDND is rare in Canada supporting the effectiveness of the Canadian PaediatricSociety guidelines. 1 References 1. Canadian Paediatric Society Fetus and Newborn Committee.

This infection is not included in the notifiable diseases system at the Federal level. It is therefore not possible to determine accurately the prevalence, incidence and trends of neonatal herpes infection in Canada. Data collection is essential to better understand the epidemiology and to monitor the trends. Canadian data on morbidity, mortality and the mother and infant risk determinants will allow comparison of neonatal herpes infection rates with other countries. It will also provide baseline data before a vaccine becomes available. The information will be used to promote prevention, control program strategies and further research and to estimate the burden of illness in Canada.HSV infections pose a serious public health concern, especially since high proportions of theseinfections are unrecognized. The most serious direct consequence of genital HSV infection is the perinatal transmission from mother to infant.Almost all cases of neonatal herpes are perinatally acquired at the time of delivery. 1 The disease in neonates is also more difficult to diagnose sinceclinical signs are non-specific and must be con- firmed by laboratory testing. 2,3 If genital HSV infection in Canadian womenfollows the same increasing trend as in the United States (US), the incidence of neonatal herpesmight rise. The expected number of cases may vary between eight and 183 using the incidence rates of the United Kingdom or Australia (2/100,000 livebirths) and the US (50/100,000 live births). 4 In 1999, the neonatal HSV infection estimate for the province of Ontario was 6.8 cases per 100,000 livebirths (eight cases reported). Therefore, the overall Canadian incidence rate for neonatal herpes infections could be higher than the British andAustralian rates. The provision of an uninterrupted flow of information (between the principal investigator and the health providers) is essential. Method This surveillance project consists of two phases. Phase I will collect non-nominal data through theCPSP until the fall of 2003. A detailed reporting questionnaire will be used to collect data on HSV infection, including neurological and othercomplications, and mother and infant risk determinants. In Phase II, working in collaboration with reporting physicians and paediatricians, theDivision of Sexual Health Promotion and STD Prevention and Control (Health Canada) will follow up, annually, for a period of three years, thecohorts of HSV-infected infants identified in Phase I to determine outcomes.Neonatal herpes simplex virusinfection Highlight In the first three months of the study, one infant with HSV-2 infection that disseminated to the central nervous system (CNS) was diagnosed at birth and died at three days of age. The majority of untreated cases of disseminated neonatal herpes infection will die and most survivors will suffer from severe neurological sequelae. It is essential to identify the true incidence of neonatal herpessimplex virus infection in Canada and its impact on surviving infants to further strengthen recommendations on prevention and control strategies. \u2014 Louise Cormier32C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S 1. Culture: Isolation of herpes simplex virus (HSV -1, HSV-2) from any site in an infant equal to or less than two months (60 days) who demonstrates one of the following: Localized infection involving the skin, eyes or mouth Disseminated infection: a) to the central nervous system (encephalitis); b) to organs other than CNS 2. Serology: Herpes simplex virus IgM in infants equal to or less than two months (60 days) of age in conjunction with one or more of the following clinical signs: herpetic vesicular lesions to skin, mouth or eyes, keratoconjunctivitis,retinal dysplasia, chorioretinitis, cataract, encephalitis, lethargy, seizures, repeat serology (HSV IgM) after three or four weeks of onset of illness if test was negativeinitially will be acceptable. 3. PCR: On cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and other tissues. Duration Phase I through the CPSP - October 2000 to September 2003 Phase II through Health Canada - Follow-up of three successive cohorts of HSV infected infants fora period of three years each - October 2001 to September 2006. Results In the three-month period from the start of the study on October 1, 2000, nine initial forms reporting possible cases of neonatal herpes infection were sent to the CPSP . Of the nine reported cases,Cases reported through the active surveillance study will be validated through the Canadian Institute of Health Information (CIHI) andthrough yearly projected laboratory surveys of HSV tests. An evaluation of the data collection process will be done upon completion of the first year for both phases. Objectives 1. T o estimate the incidence rate of neonatal herpes infection (HSV-1 and HSV-2) for the years 2000 to 2003 per 100,000 live births in Canada. 2. T o determine the proportion of HSV-infected infants with localized diseases, encephalitis or disseminated diseases. 3. T o identify risk determinants in mothers and to assess their maternal HSV status prior to delivery. 4. T o analyze trends of reported cases over a minimum period of three years by age, sex and province. 5. T o document the morbidity/mortality of neonatal infections for the years 2001 to 2006, through a cohort study of infants identified in each of the first three years of the project. Case definition For the purpose of this study, the neonatal period is being extended to 60 days of life so that late diagnoses are not missed. This will optimize the capacity to identify the maximum number of cases. All cases will be laboratory-confirmed and comprise at least one of the following:33C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S Discussion At this point, the number of neonatal HSV infection-confirmed cases is too small to draw any conclusion. The first case showed the severity and the devastating effect of neonatal HSV infection but was the infant's death due to an HSV infection or prematurity? Is neonatal HSV incidence and mortality higher among infants born to young mothers? Primary genital HSV infection is anticipated to affect younger mothers. The active surveillance study of neonatal herpes infection will provide some answers to infection trends in the Canadian population. T o evaluate the consequences of neonatal HSV infection on surviving children, it is essential, as planned in Phase II of the study, to follow thesurviving children annually for at least three consecutive years. Summary From October 1 to December 31, 2000, two confirmed cases meeting the case definitioncriteria were reported. Four possible cases are still under investigation. Of the two confirmed cases, one infant died three days after birth and was diagnosed with HSV -2 infection disseminated to the central nervous system. The other infant was diagnosed with HSV-1 infection localized to skin and mouth and survived. The total number of laboratory-confirmed neonatal herpes cases for this period might increase due to reporting delay. The follow-up time is too short to assess specific outcomes of this infection on the surviving case. References 1. Committee on Infectious Diseases, American Academy of Pediatrics. Herpes Simplex. In:one was a duplicate, two did not meet the case definition (one was diagnosed prior to the study period and the other was not laboratory- confirmed), two were laboratory-confirmed, and four are still under investigation. The first case of neonatal HSV type 2 encephalitis was confirmed in a neonate with a positive HSV-PCR on cerebrospinal fluid and an MRI showing severe cystic encephalomalacia. The 25-year-old mother acquired primary genital HSV-2 infection during the first trimester of her pregnancy. Although she had no genital lesion at the time of delivery, a cesarian section was performed due to fetal distress at week 27 of the pregnancy. The newborn weighed 1010 grams and had an Apgar of eight at five minutes. Even with initiation of intravenous acyclovir at birth, following laboratory testing, the infant died at three days of age. The second confirmed case was a newborn with localized herpes HSV-1 infection to the skin and mouth. A culture of the lesions confirmed the case 13 days after birth. The 16-year-old mother had a vaginal delivery, free of complications at 41 weeks' gestation. She was asymptomatic at delivery and had no known history of HSV infection; she could not recall any symptoms suggestive of oral or genital HSV infection. At birth, the baby weighed 3770 grams and had an Apgar of 10 at five minutes. The infant was treated with intravenous acyclovir and survived. At the time of diagnosis, no obvious sequelae were present and it was too early to evaluate the child's developmental impairment. Neither of the above two cases were diagnosed with congenital toxoplasmosis, congenital rubella, or cytomegalovirus infection.34C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S Background An enhanced active surveillance system for progressive intellectual and neurological deterioration (PIND) was implemented to detect, prospectively, among the Canadian paediatricpopulation, all persons with neurologicalPickering LK, ed. 2000 Red Book: Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases, 25th ed.Elk Grove Village: American Academy of Pediatrics, 2000: 309-18. 2.

In the eighteen-month period since the start of the study, 50 of the 83 reports received have been classified as having a progressiveneurological syndrome associated withintellectual deterioration. A definite diagnosis was available in 42 cases, representing 19 known degenerativediseases. The most common diagnoses weremitochondrial disorders (eight), ceroid lipofuscinosis (eight) and Krabbe's disease (four). Variant Creutzfeldt- Jakob disease has not been detected in Canada, but progressive childhood neurologicaldisorders do occur and are caused by many different degenerative diseases.

Exclusion criteria Static intellectual loss, e.g., after encephalitis, head injury or near-drowning. Duration July 1999 to June 2001 Methods On a monthly basis, clinicians were asked to report patients meeting the above criteria for the diagnosis of progressive intellectual andneurological deterioration in children to the CPSP . Once a case was reported to the CPSP , a standardized questionnaire was sent to thetreating physician requesting clinical data. If the patient had already been seen and a diagnosis made by a paediatric neurologist, only thediagnosis was requested. If a clinical diagnosis had not been made, information regarding the clinical history, progress of the disorder, andresults of laboratory investigations was requested. This data was reviewed by the principal investigator and patients wereclassified into one of four groups. Group A consisted of patients with clinical evidence of progressive intellectual and neurologicaldeterioration and sufficient information to make a diagnosis. Group B included patients with a history compatible with the diagnosis of eitherthe classic or variant forms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. This group of patients was referred to the CJD surveillance program for furtherinvestigation and follow-up. Group C consisted of patients with clinical evidence of progressive intellectual and neurological deterioration forconditions defined by a common presentation of progressive intellectual and neurologicaldeterioration. Participating paediatricians andneurologists used a standard screening definition for PIND. All reported cases were reviewed by the principal investigator and classified into one offour predetermined categories. Cases withevidence of neurological and intellectualregression without known cause were reviewed bya panel of paediatric neurologists. Reported cases were also reviewed for the possibility of classic or variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). If thereview panel felt that a reported case mighthave this disorder, it was referred to the CJD-Surveillance System (CJD-SS) team for furtherinvestigation. Cases referred to the CJD-SS were to be monitored through their lives and investigated at death, unless elements of thecase warranted earlier investigation. Objectives 1. T o conduct active surveillance of the Canadian paediatric population for neurologicalconditions that are defined by a common presentation: progressive intellectual and neurological deterioration. 2. T o investigate all reported cases of PIND to detect any cases of CJD or vCJD occurring in paediatric populations in Canada. 3. Upon identification of any case of CJD or vCJD, to conduct further case investigation by enrolling the case in the Canadian CJDsurveillance system. Case definition Inclusion criteria Progressive deterioration for more than three months in a child less than or equal to 18 years ofage, with loss of already attained intellectual and developmental abilities, and development of abnormal neurological signs. Include (even if specific neurologic diagnoses have been made):36C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S which an adequate reason was not available. These patients were referred to a panel of threepaediatric neurologists, one medical geneticist and a paediatric neuropathologist for possible classification. Group D consisted of patients who were referred to the study but did not meet the criteria for entry. An additional group, designated as Group U , consisted of patients awaiting further information from the referring clinician before classification. Results From the onset of this project, 83 possible cases of progressive neurological and intellectual deterioration have been reported to the CPSP (41 cases from July to December 1999 and42 cases in 2000). Eleven cases were duplicates. Forty-nine cases were classified as having a progressive neurological syndrome associated with intellectual deterioration (T able 11). A definite diagnosis was available in 42 of the reported cases. In the remaining eight cases the clinical history is strongly suggestive of a neurodegenerative disorder but at the time of this report a definite diagnosis has not been made. Only one case of iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disorder has been reported to date. This case in 1999 was also reported independently to the CJD-Surveillance System Canada. Fourteen cases were felt not to meet the above-mentioned entry criteria.

One case of acute neurological dysfunction secondary to rabies was reported. Nine cases are still waiting information necessary for classification. Three of these cases date back to the onset of this study in July 1999. Difficulty in getting this information has resulted from the limited information submitted by physicians on the original mail-back forms. Letters asking for this information often have gone unanswered. Direct telephone conversations with the physicians have in a few cases proven helpful in getting the missing information. Often, when contacted, the physicians have forgotten who the patient was or have referred the patient to a university centre for confirmation of diagnosis. Without consent for release of information, the physicians in the referral centres who have been asked to see the child in consultation have been reluctant to release the necessary information to the surveillance program. The rate of reporting of possible cases has remained fairly stable over the period of the study. The return rate from across the country has continued to be representative of the provincial population densities. Summary Cases meeting the criteria for entry into thisstudy have accrued at the expected rate. No new cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disorder have been discovered in 2000. The only known case of CJD reported to this surveillance program was also reported independently to the CJD-Surveillance System Canada. Cases of progressive intellectual and neurological disorders in children are rare events.Acknowledgements The staff of the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program for the collection of the initial data; the paediatricians, paediatric neurologists, andgeneticists of Canada for so kindly completing the forms; and the members of the expert panel (i.e., Drs.

The enzymatic defect leads to a generalized cholesterol deficiency, and to anaccumulation of the immediate precursor, 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC), in all body tissues, resulting in a characteristic syndrome of multiplemalformations, dysmorphic features, mental retardation, and behavioural abnormalities. SLO is readily diagnosed by demonstration of elevatedlevels of the cholesterol precursor 7-DHC that accumulates in body fluids and tissues of these patients. The use of a biochemical diagnostic testfor SLO has led to the diagnosis of SLO in fetusesand in infants with multiple or lethal anomalies that previously defied diagnosis, as well as in individualswho have significant mental retardation and behavioural abnormalities, but minimal physical features. Many of the latter group of patientsescaped detection for long periods of time; some were diagnosed with idiopathic mental retardation, pervasive developmental disorder, or autism. Thebehavioural phenotype of SLO is characterized by autistic features, tactile defensiveness and significant sleep disturbance among other features.T reatment of SLO with dietary cholesterol supplementation has shown promise with improvement in the general health, as shown byreduction of frequency of infections, improved growth, and significant improvement in behaviour. Families of children with SLO treated withcholesterol supplementation report great improvement in the quality of life in addition to the physical improvements. It is possible that earlyinstitution of treatment may improve the final developmental outcome of patients with SLO; thus, if SLO has a sufficiently high incidence, newbornscreening of SLO may be indicated. Objectives 1. T o determine the incidence and prevalence of inherited deficiency of 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase in Canada by ascertaining all newly diagnosed cases of SLO, and by confirming the clinical diagnosis in probable cases by demonstrating elevated 7-dehydrocholesterol level in plasma, or in blood obtained in neonatal screening blood spots. 2. T o determine if prenatal and neonatal screening for SLO is indicated in Canada. 3. T o obtain demographic and medical information on patients with SLO and to assemble a database for demographic studies and for future research use (e.g., evaluation of dietary and medical therapies, genotype-phenotype correlation).Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome Highlights All the patients with confirmed SLO, from whom appropriate samples were received, had both DHCR7 mutations identified. Identification of DHCR7 mutations allows for genetic counselling, carrier testing, and prenatal diagnosis in family members at risk. Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome has recently been found to be much more common andvariable than previously thought with cases diagnosed ranging fromfetuses with lethal malformations to children with intellectual deficits andautistic behaviours. Dr. Malgorzata Nowaczyk 39C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S Case definition Confirmed case: Elevated concentration of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) in plasma (postnatal), or in chorionic villus sample or amniotic fluid (prenatal), or in blood spots obtained as part of neonatal screening.

Duration January 2000 to December 2002 Results Results for year 1: January - December 2000TABLE 12 Reported 36Confirmed 19 Discussion Nine confirmed new cases, born or predicted-to-be born between November 14, 1999 and October 18, 2000 were reported, yielding an expected incidence of one in 37,100 births across Canada. All, but one, were cases of severe SLO, and two were pregnancies that were stopped because of multiple malformations. All of the cases of SLO were reported in infants of European Caucasian origins, suggesting that the incidence of SLO in Canadians of European Caucasian origin is one in 29,700. The report of only one patient with mild SLO born last year further confirms the need for extendedsurveillance to capture the mild cases of SLO.Information about older patients previouslydiagnosed with SLO was received and included in the growing SLO patient database, expanding our understanding of the prevalence of this conditionand the proportion of milder cases who surviveDuplicates 9Discarded 6Pending 240C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S into teenage years and adulthood. In addition, the paucity of prenatally lost cases of SLO thatwere reported to the CPSP further suggeststhat the most severely affected cases may escape diagnosis. All of the patients reported to the CPSP and confirmed to have SLO underwent mutationanalysis to detect mutations causing SLO. In all cases both mutations were identified. The identification of DHCR7 mutations allows for early prenatal diagnosis in future pregnancies for couples at risk, and for carrier identification for members of extendedfamilies. An extensive database of SLO- causing mutations in the Canadian patients, including mutations and their origins in theFrench-Canadian population and in Southern Slavs, T atars (Central Asians), and Russians has been assembled. T wo new DHCR7 mutations have also been identified. This new information is being added to known- international databases to increase theunderstanding of genotype-phenotype correlation. Thanks to the participation and cooperation of all the physicians who contribute to the success of the CPSP , the study is on its way to meeting the objectives set up at the beginning of the study.

It still ranks as a major cause ofchildhood mortality with about one to two million deaths annually. Approximately 0.1 percent of cases of measles infection result in an acutepost-infectious measles encephalitis, with a mortalityrate of 10 to 30 percent. 1 The mechanism of action is thought to be an autoimmune reaction againstbrain antigens caused by the measles virus. T wo serious late complications due to measles infection are subacute sclerosing are fatal. 2 SSPE is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a persistent infection with an altered form of the measles virus and has been thefocus of active surveillance. 3Objectives SSPE surveillance has been in place for the years 1997-2000. Active surveillance for this disease was put into place to reassure the public, and HealthCanada, about the relative safety of measles immunization, compared with wild virus infection. Case definitions For CPSP reporting purposes, only definite cases are considered. All suspect cases should be followed inan attempt to obtain the laboratory information necessary to determine whether it is a definite case. Definite case A. High titres of serum antibodies against measles virus and the presence of oligoclonal measlesvirus antibodies in CSF (Serum: CSF measlesantibody ratio indicative of intrathecal antibodyproduction). and/or B. Measles virus antigen detected in brain tissue by biopsy or at autopsy. Suspect case A. T ypical clinical history: Usually insidious onset of mental deterioration, followed (usually within a few months) by motor dysfunction,final progressive decerebration and untimelydeath andB. T ypical EEG changes (burst-suppression pattern). Duration January 1997 to December 2000 Results One case was reported in 1997 but had been initially diagnosed in 1995. The 20-year-old male had notbeen immunized and had measles at the age of threeyears. He presented with a history of forgetfulnessand hand tremors, with slowness in walking andhunching after an episode of chickenpox. Learning difficulties were also present. Positive investigations included elevated serum and CSF measles antibodies,and an EEG with stereotyped periodic sharp andSubacute sclerosing panencephalitis Highlights Since the beginning of the surveillance in 1997, only three cases of SSPE have beenreported (one delayed report from 1995 and two confirmed in 1999). All three have a high suspicion of being related to wild measles virus infection, thusconfirming the efficacy of the presentmeasles program. Although SSPE will no longer be part of the active surveillance program, case reports on SSPE should be sent to the provincial healthdepartments and the Division ofImmunization at Health Canada. All SSPE cases should have brain biopsy material analysis to identify the measles virus. \u2014 Dr. Wikke Walop42C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S slow-wave discharges every five to seven seconds. This overall pattern and clinical interpretation was suggestive of SSPE. The other two cases were diagnosed in 1999 and were associated with a high index of suspicion ofa prior episode of measles. The presenting symptoms for a 16-year-old male included a diffuse general rash followed by decreasedmemory, decreased social interaction and languagedifficulties, and a recent onset of myoclonic jerks.Laboratory tests of the cerebrospinal fluid andserum were positive for IgG. Diagnostic imagingfound that the focal signal abnormalities are thoseas described in a patient with a clinical suspicionof SSPE. The second case had been vaccinated at age one. At age six, obscure seizures started, followed bygeneralized clonic seizures, two episodes of statusepilepticus, and then atonic seizures. T wo yearslater he developed right-sided neglect, then ataxia,followed by loss of intellect ability. Although thereis no known history of measles infection, thereis a history of a rash. An EEG showed periodiccomplexes, with generalized slowing. The measlesIgG titre was 80, the IgM not determined. TheCSF IgG titre was 240. No cases were reported for the year 2000. Discussion One of the most important aspects of the CPSP as an active surveillance program is its systematic approachto case finding. Although this active phase ofsurveillance has ended, it remains important withthe elimination of indigenous measles in Canada andhigh coverage with measles vaccine that all cases ofSSPE be fully identified. Any such cases of SSPEshould continue to be reported to the Division ofImmunization at Health Canada. It remains important to follow up all suspect cases with laboratory investigations to determine theserum and CSF levels of IgG antibody. Actual titre values are preferred over more general terms, suchas positive or negative. Brain biopsy material shouldbe sent to the Viral Exanthemata Laboratory * to determine vaccine versus wild-type straindifferentiation for measles, rubella and varicella-zoster viruses. Conclusion The Division of Immunization at Health Canada hereby acknowledges the support given by the CPSP and its participants, the paediatricians acrossCanada, and the staff at the Canadian Paediatric Society. Without their diligence rare cases would go undetected. Thank you. References 1. Schneider-Schaulies S, ter Meulen V . IMPACT monitoring network: A better mousetrap. Can J Infect Dis 1993; 4: 194-5.

The CHARGE association/syndromediagnosis is based on defined clinical criteria, which should provide clear indication fordiagnosis. CHARGE association/syndrome (CAS) is a non-random occurrence of anomalies that occurstogether more frequently than one would expectdifficult to diagnose and manage. In the past, all NLF has been labeled as \"acute\" because it has lasted less than eight weeks, but often the infant isalso less than eight weeks old! Some infants with NLF have end-stage liver disease with cirrhosis, as a result of liver damage beginning during gestation. For this study, NLF has been defined as severe hepatic dysfunction with coagulopathy, metabolicinstability and signs of liver damage presenting inthe neonatal period (occurring in the first 60 daysof life). Many infants present with these symptoms soon after birth. NLF is classified as \"acute-pattern\" and \"chronic- pattern\". With the acute pattern, a previously normal liver is damaged by an acute insult, suchas herpes simplex infection, resulting in marked rises in serum aminotransferases, jaundice and coagulopathy. In the chronic pattern, significantliver damage is already established, often because of metabolic disease; cirrhosis may be present at birth, and ascites as neonatal hemochromatosis or neonatal iron storage disease) is a typical example of chronic-pattern NLF . Itusually presents early in withextensive hepatic and extrahepatic iron-overloadbut sparing the reticuloendothelial A combination of anti-oxidants with desferroxamine may be lifesaving or at least stabilize the infantuntil liver transplantation is possible. The CPSP provides a comprehensive surveillance method to collect information onall cases of NLF in Canada prospectively, withas little ascertainment bias as possible. It isanticipated that the study will find acute-patternNLF due to viral infections, acute- and chronic- pattern NLF due to hereditary tyrosinemia type and chronic-pattern NLF due to variousdisorders, notably perinatal hemochromatosis.

The original diagnostic criteria required the presence of four out of six of the characteristics; Coloboma, Heart Defect, Choanal Atresia, Retarded Growth and Development, Genital Hypoplasia, Ear Anomalies/Deafness. Recently, a medicaladvisory group working with the CHARGEAssociation Support Group recognized that some of the original anomalies were less important and that other defects were risingin diagnostic value. The proposed reviseddiagnostic criteria 1 are major characteristics: Coloboma, Choanal Atresia, CharacteristicEar Anomalies, Cranial Nerve Dysfunction Minor criteria: Heart Defect, Orofacial Cleft,Genital Hypoplasia, Growth DeficiencyDevelopmental Delay, T racheoesophagealFistula and Distinct Face. The diagnosis isfirmly established when all four major or three major and three minor criteria are present. The true incidence of CAS is not known, with estimates ranging from 0.1-1.2/100,000 livebirths. The Maritime data suggests a muchhigher incidence of 1/9,000 based on six verified cases diagnosed in the neonatal period in the last three years. The purpose of thisstudy is to determine the true incidenceof CAS in Canada. CAS lends itself tocollaborative multi-centered research.Particular areas of interest will be the behavioural phenotype, early cochlear transplantation, methods of feeding, andsensitivity to pain/sedation. The CASpopulation is at high anaesthetic risk, andgiven their numerous operations, it will beimportant to track their mortality and morbidity. An important question to be addressed is: \"Will early recognition andtreatment of these infants improve theirclinical and behavioral well being?\" Based on an incidence of 1/10,000, it is expected that 30-40 new cases per year willbe diagnosed in Canada. As CAS presents with a wide spectrum of clinical severity,mildly affected patients may also be diagnosed and can be followed prospectively. The best way to study this population comprehensivelywill be to utilize a program such as the CPSP that raises physicians' awareness of conditions like CAS.

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a deep-seated infection of the subcutaneous tissues resulting in progressive destruction of fascia and fat. This type of infection may or may not involve muscle(myositis). There are two types of NF: type I is due to mixed aerobic/anaerobic bacteria, while type II is due to group A streptococcus (GAS).Relatively little information is available in the literature on either types of NF . In Canada, most of the information has been derived frompopulation-based studies in Ontario, consisting primarily of adults. In these studies, the risk of NF was estimated to be about one case permillion population per year. In spite of the rarity of NF , its morbidity is substantial in the form of intensive care management, surgicalinterventions, including fasciotomies and amputations of body parts and a substanstial risk of death (10%). Furthermore, this condition has captured the imagination of the media with the caption \"flesh-eating disease\" often appearing in headlines to describe persons affected. Evidence from the Ontario database suggests that varicellasubstantially increases the risk of invasive GAS infections including NF . For these reasons, and because of the other common illnesses caused byGAS, some investigators are in the process ofexamining vaccine candidates for GAS. Thus, it is important to capture the burden of illness inCanada for this disease to determine the national rates and outcome that will allow future repeat studies to see if such rates are impacted byvaccines. National surveillance through the CPSP will collect demographic information about the patients, presenting signs and symptoms,management and outcome that may provide clues to recognition, prognostication and economic impact.

Currently worldwide, there are 11 national paediatric surveillance units. The population under surveillance includes 51 million children under the age of 15 years, with the assistance ofover 8,500 clinicians who are asked each month to identify cases of rare or uncommon diseases in a childhood population. Participants in theCanadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) represent 27.1% or 2,300 of these clinicians. Financial support from Health Canada allowed the CPSP to invite INoPSU members to their first formal meeting in Ottawa in June 2000. INoPSU 2000 was an unqualified success in accomplishingmany of INoPSU's stated aims and benefits. Both the business meeting and scientific symposium, held in conjunction with the Beyond 2000: Healthy T omorrows for Children and Youth conference, provided a welcomed opportunity for sharing information on the various methodologies ofsurveillance, study results, the increased awareness of the value of surveillance while recognizing potential confidentiality issues. Joint collaborative studies are seen as an important method of advancing the knowledge of uncommonchildhood disorders around the world. There are definite challenges. However, having an opportunity to meet colleagues and discuss practicalities anddifficulties provides the stimulus to forge ahead. It was agreed that INoPSU would apply for membership in the International Paediatric Association (IPA). An application will be presented to the IPA at their September 2001meeting in Beijing.International Developments CPSP 2000 and 2001 studies under surveillance in other international unitsTABLE 13 Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) Anaphylaxis (HUS)Hemorrhagic disease of syndrome (SLO) Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE)Australia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Switzerland Britain Australia Australia, Britain, New Zealand, Switzerland Australia, Britain, Latvia, New Zealand, Switzerland Australia, Britain, Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland Australia, New Zealand Britain Britain, Papua New Guinea49C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S Highlights from international units Australia Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) has been under study by the Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit(APSU) since March 1995 in response to the W orldHealth Organization (WHO) requirement for activenational surveillance in the process of accreditation of a region as polio-free. The expected incidence of AFP in Australia is one case per 100,000 childrenunder the age of 15 years. The reported rate in April2000 was 0.99 per 100,000 indicating that thesurveillance system is sufficiently sensitive. For the years 1995 to 1999, there were 143 cases of AFP with an additional 47 cases in 2000 afterduplicates and errors were excluded. No cases ofwild-type polio were identified to December 1999,and review by the National Polio Expert Committeeis outstanding in 20 cases notified in 2000. In addition to its contribution to certification of Australia as polio-free, the study has providedclinical data on the causes of AFP in Australianchildren. The most common diagnoses in non-polioAFP cases were Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (47%) and transverse myelitis (16%). The highlight for the APSU in 2000 was the announcement by the WHO on October 29 thatAustralia, along with the other 36 countries of the W estern Pacific region, is polio-free. The role of the APSU, in conjunction with the Victorian InfectiousDiseases Research Laboratory and the Department of Health and Aged Care, has been crucial in this process. Surveillance for polio, using the APSU,must continue until there is global certification. The importance of the APSU and the AFP study was reinforced by both the WHO and the Federalgovernment representatives at the Strategic Planning Meeting for Polio Eradication in Australia held in Canberra, in February 2001.Britain Active prospective surveillance of UK children with progressive intellectual and neurological deterioration (PIND) commenced in May 1997 andis expected to continue until April 2002. Fundedby the Department of Health, this study is incollaboration with the National Creutzfeldt-JakobDisease Surveillance Centre in Edinburgh and the Public Health Laboratory Service in London. The main aim of this surveillance is to gather uniqueepidemiological data on a variety of paediatricneurological conditions and to investigate whetherUK children are developing variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). T o mid-February 2001, a total of 1,086 children have been reported via the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit (BPSU). An expertgroup of six paediatric neurologists meets quarterlyin London to classify the anonymous clinicalinformation. They have discussed 785 cases and have allocated these to appropriate study groups as follows: Group B - definite or probable vCJD = 4 cases(3 definite, 1 probable)Group A - clear diagnosis, not vCJD = 435Group U - meets case definition for PIND butstill under investigation = 159 Group C - idiopathic PIND, not vCJD = 40 Not PIND (no case) = 147227 cases are not included (e.g., reporting error,duplicate reports) and the remainder (74) areoutstanding. Four cases of vCJD (three definite and one probable) have been notified in the past 18 months \u2014 theyoungest (ever reported) was a girl aged 12 years atonset. The other three were a girl aged 14 years andtwo boys aged 15 years at onset. Three have died andneuropathology has confirmed vCJD. As these four children were all notified relatively recently, the possibility remains that an increasing number ofchildren will present with vCJD in the next year. The study is producing unique national population- based data on the causes of PIND. The majority of children with PIND have a confirmed or likely50C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S underlying diagnosis that is not vCJD. In the 435 children with a confirmed diagnosis there were 89 different neurodegenerative conditions. The sixmost commonly occurring diagnoses are the neuronalceroid-lipofuscinoses (55 cases), the gangliosidoses(50 cases), mitochondrial encephalomyelopathies(38 cases), the mucopolysaccharidoses (33 cases), adrenoleukodystrophy (28 cases) and Niemann Pick T ype C (22 cases). Demographic analysis reveals interesting variations in reporting rates between paediatric centres.Y orkshire remains the region with the highest number of notifications (139). Paediatricians are still responding enthusiastically at an average rateof around 24 notifications per month.

A nationwide survey in Germany on fatal asthma andnear-fatal asthma in children: Different Latvia Surveillance activities have been curtailed in Latviadue to personal health problems. Other complicatingfactors include the change in primary paediatricmedical care organization to mostly family doctors,not more paediatricians. Only the hemolytic uremicsyndrome study was continued with two cases in 2000. Malaysia Malaysia is a developing country with a developing paediatric surveillance unit. The program, establishedas part of the Malaysian Paediatric Association in 1994, is encountering problems of which funding is but one. The program has received some enquiries regarding studies but is awaiting decisions from theMalaysian Paediatric Association concerning thefuture of the program. In the interim, surveillancehas been suspended. Netherlands The signal of pertussis in hospital was our program's highlight. The impact of this study influenced a change in our national vaccination policy. Instead of vaccinating at three, four, andfive months, it was decided to vaccinate at two, three and four months, partly due to the found incidence of early cases of pertussis. New Zealand Seven confirmed cases of hemolytic uremicsyndrome (HUS) in children were reported in1999, compared to 14 cases in 1998. Information was not obtained on one notified case. The cases came from a geographically dispersed area, ranging from Auckland to Christchurch, although seven of the eight notified cases were from the North Island. The median age for the 1999 cohort of patients was 2.7 years, (range 0.3-14 years) In two cases, the Shiga toxin O157:H7 was detected in stool specimens. T wo other infants developed HUS following pneumococcal meningitis. The mean of diagnosis was seven days (range 1-14 days). All children survived their initial disease but one infant was left with chronic renal failure following pneumococcal meningitis. Although the rate of Shiga toxin-related infections continues to increase, the number of HUS cases has fallen in 1999. There are still delays in the diagnosis of this condition.51C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S Papua New Guinea Surveillance of renal tubular acidosis contributed to a publication, in collaboration with the University of Bristol and University CollegeLondon, on the association of renal tubular acidosis with red cell ovalocytosis (Bruce LJ, Wrong O, T oye AM, Young Ogle GD et al.J Biochem 2000; 350: 41-51). This collaboration has led to improved management for Papua New Guinean children affected with renal tubular acidosis, as well as the academic interest. Switzerland In 1995, a new water-soluble mixed-micellar analogue of vitamin K1 (Konakion\u00ae MM paediatric) was introduced in Switzerland toreplace the formerly used fat-soluble Konakion\u00aedrops for the prevention of vitamin K 1 deficiency bleeding (VKDB) in infants. According to the new guidelines, an oral dose of 2 mg is given after birth and again on the fourth day of life. The impact ofthese guidelines on the incidence of VKDB was evaluated within the Swiss Paediatric Surveillance Unit (SPSU) from 1995 to 2000. More than 99 % of infants received vitamin K 1 prophylaxis. Since July 1995, 93 % of the new- borns have received prophylaxis according to the new guidelines; the remaining infants were givenfat-soluble Konakion\u00ae drops or parenteral vitamin K 1. Within six years, one case of classical and 21 cases of late-onset VKDB (19 confirmed,two probable) were reported to the SPSU. Out of the 19 confirmed late-onset cases, 13 have received the recommended prophylaxis, whereasfive have not and one had been given fat-soluble Konakion\u00ae drops. All but two confirmed cases of late-onset VKDB occurred in fully breast-fedinfants and 14 of 19 had hepatobiliary disease. The incidence of late-onset VKDB in infants who have received the recommended prophylaxis has decreased by 60% from 7.2:100,000 (95% CI 3.1-14.2) in 1986-1987 to 2.8:100,000 (95 % CI 1.1-5.8) between 1995 and 1998. Unfortunately, despite its better bioavailability, the mixed-micellar vitamin K 1 preparation does not protect all infants with underlying cholestatic disease. Our observations raise questions regarding thereported pharmacokinetics of Konakion\u00ae MM. It appears that absorption of this drug in infants with cholestasis is not as good as had beenexpected. This issue is the topic of a current detailed analysis of the data and review of the actual recommendations. In summary, a mixed-micellar preparation of vitamin K 1 (Konakion\u00ae MM) is suitable for prophylaxis of VKDB in newborns and superiorto the previously used fat-soluble preparation(Konakion\u00ae). However, the Swiss experience todate shows that a regimen consisting of two oraldoses of Konakion\u00ae MM given during the firstweek of life does not protect all infants withcholestatic disease from late-onset VKDB.Oral prophylaxis in fully breastfed infantswould have to include repetitive doses ifprotection from general prophylaxis is expectedto include Eur J Pediatr 1999; 148: 599-602 Wales Surveillance of childhood tuberculosis in Wales was undertaken to measure the true incidence of childhood tuberculosis and to improve itscontrol and management in Wales. Objectives include: to establish an active surveillance system for childhood tuberculosis;to compile an accurate, detailed case register ofchildhood tuberculosis, including managementand public health measures; to identify potentialareas for improving prevention of tuberculosis;to remind clinicians of the importance ofnotification of tuberculosis and cleardocumentation of the diagnosis andmanagement in the case notes; to improveknowledge of British Thoracic Society guidelineson tuberculosis.52C P S P 2 0 0 0 R E S U L T S Case definitions include: all cases of tuberculosis whether confirmed, probable or possible (as defined by the Public Health Laboratory Service)due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in children from birth until and including the16th birthday; pulmonary or extra pulmonaryinvolvement and all children receiving chemoprophylaxis for tuberculosis. Infections due to atypical mycobacteria were excluded. T wenty-nine cases of childhood tuberculosis (seven confirmed, 17 probable, five possible)and 38 children on chemoprophylaxis against tuberculosis have been reported to date. T wo cases did not meet the criteria, one was an 18-year-oldand the other was later confirmed by culture andreported as atypical mycobacteria. Site oftuberculosis: intra-thoracic, seven; meningitis, three; abdominal, one and others, two. Cases were seen predominantly in the white population. The majority of children had not hadBCG vaccination, including several from the high-risk group. Among the 16 children belonging toethnic minorities, seven had not been vaccinated with BCG, and the vaccination status was not known in two cases. In a number of cases, notification was incomplete or delayed. Threechildren were only given chemoprophylaxis eventhough the chest X-ray was abnormal. Theseshould have been treated as possible cases. This isimportant because the duration of treatment is different. T wo cases should have received chemoprophylaxis. Childhood tuberculosis continues to be an important communicable disease problem. This is a reflection of the ongoing transmission of thedisease in the population and also a measure of theeffectiveness of the various preventive measures.The latter includes screening of new immigrants,detection and treatment of index cases, notification of index cases, contact tracing, chemoprophylaxis to susceptible contacts andBCG vaccination of the high-risk groups. Theproblem is compounded by undernotificationof the disease and inconsistent adherence topublished British Thoracic Society guidelines on tuberculosis.
