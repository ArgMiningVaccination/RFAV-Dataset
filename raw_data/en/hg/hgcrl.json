But my anxiety extends beyond occasional air travel to many other areas of my everyday life, too, from worrying about what I ate for lunch to panicking over my financial future. It's a lot. So I was intrigued when I heard about a new, high-tech health assessment that could pinpoint the exact source of my anxiety, allegedly allowing me to heal through holistic remedies alone. Would it work? The treatment hailed from [The Organic Pharmacy](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525074&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theorganicpharmacy.com%2F), a London-based retailer that counts health-conscious Gwyneth Paltrow, Jessica Alba, and Madonna as clients. This summer, they opened their first East Coast outpost (they opened a store in Beverly Hills in 2008), making one of their buzziest offerings\u2014a galvanic body scan\u2014available to anyone who can make it to NYC. Whether you suffer from general anxiety (like me) or have a more specific issue in mind (trouble conceiving, or regulating your menstrual cycle, maybe), the Organic Pharmacy promises the galvanic body scan can help. It works by sending a low voltage of electricity to the fluid in body tissues, in order pick up on hormone balances, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, toxicity and stress levels, and food intolerances. With the information the scan provides, on site homeopaths prescribe a program complete with supplements, herbs, and food recommendations, all individually tailored to your results. Honestly, when I went in for my assessment, I assumed my results would be pretty good. Sure, I suffer from headaches here and there, experience digestive upset every once in a while, and on occasion, I feel sluggish. But who doesn't? I told all of this to Urvi Radia, a certified homeopath who has been practicing for more than 13 years, who asked me a range of questions about my current health before my scan. Stress levels, diet habits, sleep patterns\u2014she wanted to know it all. She also collected intel on any and all major life events that may have affected my health (dating all the way back to my childhood) as well as my family's medical history. As she explained, \"homeopathy considers the person as a whole: their physiologic, pathologic, and mental makeup.\" Basically, it was all relevant, not just the scan. But oh, the scan. To start, I placed my hands and bare feet on two large metal plates while two electrodes were fastened to my forehead. It made me look like the subject of some sort of top secret science experiment, which I sort of was. During the three-minute procedure, the machine visited 22 different organs in my body, determining whether each was performing at a normal level (marked with a green bar), hyperactive (yellow), or below a normal level (blue). As my entire body was being scanned, I saw a lot of yellow and blue popping up on the screen (green seemed to be nonexistent!), and I immediately began to worry. It must have been written all over my face, because Radia began to assure me that I did have some normal functioning organs. Actually, all my organs were working just fine, but my liver was a concern. Since I don't eat fried foods and only drink alcohol on occasion, this surprised me. \"It's most likely caused by your anxiety, and vice versa,\" explained Radia. \"If your liver isn't functioning fine, that can cause you to have anxiety, and your anxiety can also run the liver down.\" Harumph. After a session, Radia always gives her clients herb and supplement recommendations based on their results, so for me, she prescribed a liver and kidney tincture made up of dandelion, milk thistle, and artichoke to get my liver back into tiptop shape. As for my anxiety, Radia recommended I take calcium and magnesium complex to calm my nervous system, and even concocted a homeopathic remedy created specifically for my flying jitters. Additionally, the magical machine computed a specific diet based on my ailments that were picked up during the scan. \"The food recommendation chart breaks down everything,\" said Radia. \"It tells you what kind of carbohydrates you should be eating, what sort of animal protein you need, what vegetables to avoid and which to eat. That's all to promote a healthy lifestyle and give your body's alkaline complete balance.\" (It turns out I have a gluten sensitivity and should steer clear of wheat, oats, breakfast cereal, and pizza.) Weeks later, while it's too early to tell if the holistic approach will be the cure to my anxiety once and for all, I can say this: I have never felt more in control of my health, both mental and physical. Though I don't think I will ever be able to give up bread for good, or add chia seeds to every meal, I'm now equipped with the insight and tools to improve the way my body functions. In six weeks when I return for my follow up appointment, I'll be able to see just how effective homeopathic healing really is, just in time for me to book my flights home for the holidays. But in the meantime (and perhaps most importantly?) I feel like I'm more equipped to manage my anxiety, like the simple process of going through the assessment and scan had a calming effect, because clearly I was taking charge enough to go get checked out. That's something too, isn't it?
