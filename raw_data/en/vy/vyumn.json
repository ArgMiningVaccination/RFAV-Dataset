To make that point, IFAD's Indigenous Peoples Assistance Facility had provided $10,000-$30,000 for small projects designed and implemented by indigenous peoples at the grass-roots level, he said. Over two years, it had funded 73 micro-projects in 47 countries. It was supported by the World Bank, along with the Governments of Norway, Canada, Finland and Italy. The Board comprised four indigenous leaders -- including the Forum's Chair. It was an innovative way for IFAD to learn about needs and solutions, and to scout out innovation. The IFAD also deeply valued collaboration. \"For us, partnership is fundamental\", he asserted. Over the past six years, 20 per cent of lending to Governments had directly benefited indigenous peoples and their territories. There were 91 ongoing projects in 27 countries, some of which focused on securing access to traditional lands, promoting indigenous women in their communities, and valuing traditional knowledge systems. The IFAD also had provided the Forum and its inter-agency support group with $500,000 to further their work. As for how to move forward, he said more work was needed to secure indigenous peoples' access to traditional lands and territories. It was also vital to systematically document indigenous peoples' best practices in dealing with climate change and to support local environmental conservation efforts. Indigenous peoples' challenges must be at the centre -- and not at the periphery -- of the development agenda. Picking up that thread, Sha Zukang, Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, said he was proud that much of his Department's cutting-edge research and policy analysis focused on indigenous issues -- whether in the area of gender equality and the advancement of women, sustainable forest management or public administration. Such work played out in along broad functional lines. The Department of Economic and Social Affairs had long helped indigenous peoples participate in multi-stakeholder dialogues, including Agenda 21 -- adopted at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development -- which recognized them as a major group. In addition, he said the Department had worked to include indigenous peoples in policy development and decision-making, as seen in the adoption, by the Commission on the Status of Women, of a resolution calling for measures to address indigenous women's concerns. It also had made efforts to include indigenous peoples in statistics and disaggregated data, and to integrate their needs into technical cooperation and capacity development activities. For its part, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) had intensified efforts to mainstream a culturally sensitive approach to its programmes at global, regional and national levels, in line with the Forum's recommendations. UNFPA Deputy Executive Director Purnima Mane said the agency was learning to better deliver \"inter-cultural\" reproductive health information, education and services that respected indigenous peoples' world views and cultures. Important results had been seen in the development of inter-cultural health models that involved traditional midwives and local healers acting as \"cultural brokers\" between indigenous world views on health and Western medical practices. In her closing remarks, Ms. Mane said that today's dialogue was a turning point in UNFPA's collaboration with the Forum. National indicators often hid huge disparities among indigenous groups. To remedy that and tackle other challenges, she vowed to help create a more meaningful, culturally pertinent role for indigenous peoples in development processes. \"Nothing about you, without you\", she concluded. Also speaking today were observers for Nicaragua, Denmark, Mexico and Norway. Forum members from the Philippines, Australia, Morocco, Bolivia, Uganda, Iran and the Congo also spoke. Additional panel presentations were made by Antonella Cordone, Coordinator for Indigenous and Tribal Issues, Policy Division, Toure, Officer-in-Charge, Culture, Gender and Human Rights Branch, UNFPA. Also contributing to the dialogue was Christine Brautigam, Chief of the Women's Rights Section, United Nations Division for the Advancement of Women. And, from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs: Srdjan Mrkic, Chief, Social and Housing Statistics Section, Statistics Division; David O'Connor, Division for Sustainable Development; Tonya Vaturi, Division of Sustainable Development; as well as Peter Csoka, Senior Forest Policy Officer, United Nations Forum on Forum on Forests; Roberto Villarreal, Chief, Socio-Economic Governance and Management Branch, Division for Public Administration and Management; Jean-Pierre Gonnot, Acting Director, Division for Social Policy and Jorge Parra, UNFPA representative from Ecuador; Alfonso Sandoval, UNFPA from Bruce Campbell, UNFPA Representative from Viet Nam; and Azza Karam, Senior Cultural Advisr, UNFPA. Representatives of the following organizations also spoke: Indigenous Peoples Organization of Australia, Confederation des Associations Amazighes du sud Marocain (Tamunt Niffus), Caucus Amazigh, National Native Title Council, de Bolivia, Asian Caucus, Confederaci\u00f3n Sindical de Comunidades Interculturals de Bolivia, and Habitat Pro Association. The Forum will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, 27 May, to continue its session. Background The Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues resumed its eighth annual session today in which indigenous delegations were to continue an in-depth interactive dialogue with six United Nations agencies and funds -- part of its new working methods under item 6. Participating agencies included the Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). (For more information, please see Press Release HR/4986.) Statement on National Sorry Day Forum Chairperson VICTORIA TAULI-CORPUZ opened the meeting by acknowledging that today was the twelfth anniversary of National Sorry Day in Australia. TROY BRICKELL, Indigenous Peoples Organization of Australia, said that in 1997 Australia's Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission had released the \"Bringing Them Home Report of 1997\", a response to the \"National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families\", now commonly referred to as the \"Stolen Generations\". In an era of \"protection\", the Australian Government had wanted to eradicate indigenous people, put them on missions and reserves, isolate them from society, and subject them to restrictions and assimilation rules in the hope that they would \"breed out and die out\" under the guise that \"it's for their betterment\". He said that the policies and rules of the ordinances of 1910 to 1912 had been modified to implement that \"protection\" order until 1970, and they varied according to state and territory Governments. In reality, the practice of removal had occurred since colonization. Coloured and mixed race indigenous children were removed from their families, communities and land, trained in institutions and forbidden to practice their traditional customs and language. Those policies and practices contravened the human rights of all Australians and violated the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Bringing Them Home Report, however, covered removal until 1971, evidence that the human rights of indigenous Australians were not counted when Australia signed the Declaration. Between 1998 and 2003, all state and territory Governments had said \"sorry\", he continued. During the last 12 years, National Sorry Day events had been held in every state and territory. He commended the Australian Government for giving on 13 February 2008 a genuine and honest \"Motion of Apology to Australia's Indigenous Peoples\", which was passed by the Australian Parliament. That apology confirmed beyond all doubt that the separation and removal of \"full blood\" indigenous people to missions and reserves, and the removal and separation of \"half caste\" indigenous children to institutions were real practices and policies. The National Inquiry included 535 individual stories and 777 submissions. The Stolen Generations and other Australians believed that it would bring justice. Noting that the Bringing Them Home Report included 54 recommendations, he said half had been implemented, among them, the annual commemoration of National Sorry Day. During the past decade, the Australian Government had funded \"Link Up\" organizations to help the Stolen Generations find and reconnect with family. The Australian Government had established an Indigenous Steering Committee to implement a much-needed \"Healing Foundation\" to address the trauma experienced by families and communities. He then called on the Forum to observe a moment of silence to reflect on the millions of people who had never made it back home, who had been lost, stolen, enslaved or persecuted, and who were refugees, and victims of genocide and disempowerment worldwide. Interactive Dialogue Featured in this morning's dialogue were Sha Zukang, Under-Secretary General for Economic and Social Affairs; for Policy Division; and Antonella Cordone, IFAD's Coordinator for Indigenous and Tribal Issues Policy Division. Mr. SHA, noting that the Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) conducted cutting-edge research and policy analysis on a wide range of issues, said, \"I take pride in the fact that much of this work is focused on indigenous issues.\" Highlighting the major functions of the six Divisions represented today, he said the Division for Sustainable Development supported the United Nations Agenda 21, among other platforms, and served as the secretariat of the Commission on Sustainable Development. The secretariat of the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF) promoted the management, conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests, which included action based on the Forest Principles. He said the Statistics Division developed international statistical standards and guidelines, and provided support to national statistical agencies, while the Division for Public Administration and Development Management was entrusted with implementing the United Nations Programme in Public Administration and Development. The Division for the Advancement of Women supported intergovernmental bodies, including the General Assembly, in gender equality work. Finally, the Division for Social Policy and Development strengthened international cooperation for the inclusion of marginalized groups -- especially indigenous peoples -- among others. The Division's work on indigenous issues was based on the mandate of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, and other mandates by the General Assembly, the most recent of which was the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Providing a framework for understanding DESA's work on indigenous issues, he said DESA had facilitated participation of indigenous peoples in multi-stakeholder dialogues of intergovernmental processes. For example, indigenous peoples were recognized as a major group in Agenda 21, while the Forum on Forests worked closely with indigenous peoples to enable their participation in multi-stakeholder dialogues convened at each session of the Commission on Sustainable Development and the Forum on Forests. To that point, he said, during the Sustainable Development Commission's seventeenth session earlier this month, indigenous peoples had participated in ministerial round tables and had, among other things, called for prioritizing traditional knowledge within local and regional agricultural systems. In addition, he said, DESA strove to include indigenous peoples in policy development and decision-making, as noted by the Commission on the Status of Women's adoption of a resolution calling for measures to address indigenous women's concerns. The Department also had made efforts to include indigenous peoples in statistics and disaggregated data, as seen in DESA's support for the latest version of the \"United Nations Principles and Recommendations for Population and Housing Census\", which outlined the need to disaggregate statistics on the basis of ethno-cultural characteristics. The Department also promoted the integration of indigenous issues in technical cooperation and capacity-development activities, he said, noting the adoption by the Intra-Departmental Task Force on Indigenous Issues of the \"Framework of DESA technical cooperation programmes in countries with indigenous peoples\". That would be used in the formulation and implementation of capacity-development activities. In closing, he emphasized that he had always highlighted the need for DESA to promote, not merely development for all, but especially development for vulnerable groups. Indeed, indigenous peoples were among the world's most disadvantaged, and the international community had recognized the need for special measures to protect their rights. In accomplishing that task, he would continue to rely on the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Peoples. Comments and Questions Launching a round of questions, Chairperson TAULI-CORPUZ, Forum member from the Philippines, asked how the Division on the Advancement of Women perceived the impact of the Declaration on its activities. What did the Division contribute towards the empowerment of indigenous women's organizations and networks? What constraints existed? For the Division on Sustainable Development, she noted there were several references -- for the first time -- in the final report of its recent meeting, despite difficulties in negotiations. The final report acknowledged the adoption of the Declaration. How did the Division see the Declaration impacting its activities, especially vis-\u00e0-vis technical assistance? Could it feed into its work in that area? Also, how had the Division helped to strengthen indigenous peoples' organizations and networks? For the Forum on Forests, she said that, while some indigenous peoples had participated in the Forum since its establishment, many had decided not to take part because discussions had become \"sterile\" or \"totally taken over by the forest industry\". They felt alienated in that process. What were the implications of the Declaration's adoption on the Forum on Forests? How could the views of major groups be better incorporated into discussion of sustainable forest management issues, which had gained prominence in the dialogue on climate change? Further, how could the Forum increase major group's participation in future sessions? MICK DODSON, Forum member from Australia, asked whether the Statistics Division had improved indigenous peoples' identification in the 2010 round of censuses and, if so, had it included indigenous peoples fully in that process. How did the Division for Public Administration perceive the impacts of the Declaration's adoption on its activities? How did the Division for Social Policy and Development mainstream gender equality and indigenous youth perspectives into its work? United Nations Response Responding to those queries, CHRISTINE BRAUTIGAM, Chief of the Women's Rights Section in the Division for the Advancement of Women, noted the Division's experience with the 1993 Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, which she hoped would take on a strong role vis-\u00e0-vis indigenous issues. Article 22 of that Declaration required States to take actions to ensure the protection of women and children from violence. It would help guide the analytical work pertaining to indigenous women and strengthen support in intergovernmental processes. As for how the Division had contributed to empowering women's organizations, she highlighted two ways it had done so through research and policy work, support for intergovernmental processes on gender equality, and the convening of expert panels on such topics. In addition, a database on violence against women, launched in March 2009, included indigenous women, while the Division's 2007 priority theme -- on the elimination on all forms of discrimination and violence against the girl child -- had highlighted the needs of indigenous girls, particularly in the context of education. In its general discussion of rural women, the Division had focused, in a 2007 report, on rural indigenous women. Other climate change discussions focused on indigenous women's vulnerability to the phenomenon. As for the Division's limited resources to focus on indigenous women, she said indigenous women were highlighted in the Division's multi-platform programme of work. However, there was no specific theme on indigenous women, nor had the Division been mandated to produce a specific report on them. Regarding measures to improve identification of indigenous people in the 2010 round of national censuses, SRDJAN MRKIC, Chief, Social and Housing Statistics Section, Statistics Divisions, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, said the United Nations Statistics Commission represented all State offices, which served as its partners at the national level. One and a half years ago, the Commission had recommended that all countries undertake at least one national census on population and housing during the period 2005-2014. To do that, it would be necessary to conduct field work within existing social structures, including indigenous peoples' communities. The Commission's guidelines clearly stated that all questionnaires must be translated into all languages, including all indigenous peoples' languages. The Commission had also advised Governments to recruit indigenous peoples to conduct questionnaires in order to ensure a high quality of responses in national censuses and to have their technical support staff work with indigenous elders so that indigenous peoples understood the census process and had their issues addressed, such as climate change, sustainable development and forestry. He said that the Commission had developed several clear statistics guidelines for national statistics organizations to ensure complete coverage of all people in their national boundaries. At present, however, there was no internationally agreed standard to identify ethnicities. In terms of whether indigenous people fully participated in the 2010 round of national census, he said the Statistics Division had a broad programme of hands-on seminars and workshops. The Division's Tabulation Unit had a specialist for indigenous peoples. It was often difficult to compile statistics on indigenous peoples due to the lack of birth, marriage and divorce certificates for them. Such certificates were usually part of civil registries, but they were not available in many countries. To rectify that, the Statistics Division's handbook on civil registration clearly emphasized the need for greater efforts to register everyone in all communities. In half the world, national civil registration systems did not function correctly. DAVID O'CONNOR, Division for Sustainable Development, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, said the 1987 Report of the Brundtland Commission stated that tribal and indigenous peoples needed greater attention. It noted that their traditional rights should be recognized and that they be given a decisive voice in formulating policies affecting their communities, land and areas. Also from the Division for Sustainable Development, TONYA VATURI, said that indigenous peoples' organizations could be selected to conduct field work and data compilation for the Division. National data indicators on indigenous peoples were available in the Division's national recording mechanisms and in its country profiles. During last year's Forum session, the Division had hosted side events that informed indigenous peoples about how they could be involved in the Division's work. The Division's Steering Committee had conducted a special study on indigenous peoples in Africa. This year, the Division had created a dialogue with indigenous peoples, Government ministers and heads of United Nations agencies, programmes and funds. The Division had technical support projects in Africa, including Senegal and Ghana, as well as in Nepal. It was working to strengthen national capacity for sustainable development principles in emerging economies. PETER CSOKA, Senior Forest Policy Officer, UN Forum on Forests, said the General Assembly had adopted a non-legally binding instrument for the protection of all kinds of forests, which had various policy recommendations and action items. The Forum on Forests' multi-year work programme would also include activities for indigenous peoples in 2011. To the criticism about the participation of major groups at the Forum's recent sessions, he hoped that recent experiences had been more favourable. Major groups' participation would be encouraged, and he hoped informal consultations had provided some good examples. The views of major groups could be presented in a focused manner as early as possible in the discussions. Participation of major groups should be encouraged, and in one resolution the secretariat had asked for ways to do so, he went on. The secretariat was committed to supporting their contribution at upcoming major events. ROBERTO VILLARREAL, Chief, Socio-Economic Governance and Management Branch, Division for Public Administration and Management, speaking on the Declaration's impact, said the Declaration had translated into concrete activities. In the area of global governance, the Division had worked on indigenous peoples' civic participation, and was offering online training for Governments on the rights of indigenous peoples. It would start work on the development of various governance indicators, as they pertained to indigenous people. He said another project on civic engagement in government had included the experiences of two cities in Ecuador in a report on that topic. Also, an April 2008 panel discussion on managing local governments had included representatives from Australia and Morocco. As for assessing the impact of having indigenous women as a target group, he said that indigenous women constituted a special group in indigenous society, and, on top of that, they were particularly disadvantaged. He suggested concentrating on challenges, including the feminization of rural communities, which threatened traditional social protection networks. JEAN-PIERRE GONNOT, Acting Director, Division for Social Policy and Development, said his Division was proud to host the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues secretariat. \"The work of our colleagues is really an inspiration to the entire Division\", he said. As for mainstreaming indigenous issues into its work, it had followed the Forum's policy messages and paid attention to indigenous women on various fronts. For example, in the area of awareness-raising, the secretariat had worked with women's organizations, including through a 2004 high-level panel at the Commission on the Status of Women on women's role in conflict resolution. In the area of operational activities, he said the Division, with other United Nations bodies, had established a working group on indigenous women, which overviewed indigenous women in the United Nations system. It had published a report in English and Spanish, which it disseminated to all United Nations country teams. It had also prepared United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) guidelines on indigenous peoples, which incorporated tenets of the Declaration. In the area of technical cooperation, he highlighted an ongoing project, begun in 2005, which focused on engaging indigenous women in local government. That was being carried out with indigenous women's groups, local authorities and United Nations bodies in Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. As for supporting indigenous youth, he said the Indigenous Youth Caucus had been a consistent voice at the Forum's sessions, while the United Nations programme on youth had dedicated a chapter on \"indigenous youth and climate change\" in its 2009 report. Comments and Questions FERHAT MEHENNI, Confederation des Associations Amazighes du sud Marocain (Tamunt Niffus), said there had been an ongoing struggle between the Amazighes and Algerian Government since 1963. The very existence of the Amazighes was threatened. Their land was under military occupation. The military police sometimes set fire to their lands and had, over the years, burned thousands of olive trees, the mainstay of their economy and well-being. NAIT SID KAMIRA, Caucus Amazigh, asked the Forum about its plans to work with indigenous peoples' non-governmental organizations on the ground. How did the Forum plan to build their capacity? Was it going to visit the lands and communities? How would it protect them from the policies of the Algerian Government? How did the Forum plan to address its current deadlock with the Economic and Social Council on disseminating the rights of indigenous peoples? Would it work with non-governmental organizations that formed part of the indigenous peoples' diaspora? How did the Economic and Social Council and the Forum intend to protect the rights of indigenous peoples in Africa, as most of United Nations system did not even address their situation? LES MALEZER, National Native Title Council, asked what DESA programmes were doing to implement articles 26, 29 and 32 of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Apart from the Second International Decade of the World's Indigenous People, what was being done to implement the Declaration? Were Governments contributing more to its voluntary fund? Were there any specific DESA initiatives to promote it? Since indigenous people had a limited presence in the Commission on Sustainable Development, should the role of the voluntary fund be revised to ensure more indigenous peoples' representation at the Commission's meetings? STEDMAN FAGOTH, observer for Nicaragua, asked to whom he should address his request that the population and housing census in Nicaragua be carried out along that country's coast. United Nations Response Mr. MRKIC said Mr. Fagoth should address their request to the National Statistics Office of Nicaragua. The United Nations guidelines for national censuses were very straightforward -- they stated that everyone within a country's national boundaries must be included, regardless of ethnicity or religion. Comments and Questions HASSAN ID BALKASSM, Forum member from Morocco, said it was well known that Government assimilation policies had robbed indigenous peoples of their collective rights. All States must issue national apologies for that, as Australia's Government and other Governments had done. The Government of Morocco had created many partnerships relating to women's rights, but major projects were often handed over to multinational companies without the consent or involvement of indigenous peoples, particularly indigenous women. What was the United Nations doing to rectify that? The Declaration referred to the rights of indigenous youth. As a result, would youth be able to receive new education grants in specialized fields? Were there any plans to implement the Second Decade within the framework of partnerships for sustainable development? ELISA CANQUI MOLLO, Forum member from Bolivia, expressed concern over United Nations operational activities for indigenous peoples at the country level. Were there any plans to decentralize the Forum's office or to set up country offices? Or would indigenous people continue to work only with focal points, which did not have much influence? United Nations Response Mr. VILLARREAL said policies were set by the General Assembly, and Departments followed those policies. Wherever possible, indigenous peoples were involved in the secretariat of the Permanent Forum. Moreover, 20 indigenous consultants had been included in various projects in 2008. Also, DESA, in cooperation with the Inter-agency Support Group on Indigenous Issues, had prepared a database of indigenous experts available to work in the United Nations system. He looked forward to cooperating with the International Labour Organization (ILO) on the preparation of other studies. As for the voluntary fund, grants had been given to organizations from Africa. He hoped to cooperate with Governments for the mid-decade review sometime next year. To engage all Governments, DESA would launch a capacity-building programme on the Declaration. As for operational problems facing countries in conjunction with policy matters, he said the Division conducted research with indigenous peoples on what worked and what did not in different contexts. He sought the comments of indigenous representatives on those matters, following this morning's session. Mr. O'CONNOR said the Division for Sustainable Development also would be interested in speaking with indigenous representatives on the issue of mining and indigenous communities. There was perhaps room for collaboration, including on the preparation of reports. Also, in the area of sustainable consumption and production, indigenous communities had important knowledge to share. He hoped to bring more indigenous representatives to the Commission's next session. Comments and Questions ELIAS QUELCA, Confederaci \u00f3n de Pueblos Ind \u00edgenas de Bolivia, said he had followed all reports presented to the Forum. He also continued to hear claims of violence and discrimination. Indigenous peoples from his region wished to make it known that the key process concerned \"rebuilding\", for which indigenous people needed funding, which must reach them directly, if it were to be used for their activities. Presenting the work of IFAD with indigenous peoples, Mr. AUDINET highlighted the importance of \"people-centred, equitable and sustainable development\", saying that indigenous peoples' challenges were at the centre -- not the periphery -- of the development agenda. In research of any poor, rural communities in Asia, Latin America or Africa, an indigenous community was encountered, most of the time. Addressing indigenous peoples' needs -- and their struggle to overcome poverty -- was an operational challenge. Meeting it required recognition of the diversity of poverty, and building on indigenous peoples' distinctiveness as an asset in their own economic development. Providing an overview of IFAD, he said its mandate was to support developing countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty and hunger in rural areas. Three quarters of the world's extremely poor people area lived in rural areas. They were pastoralists, landless rural workers, hunters and gatherers -- many of whom were indigenous peoples. For more than 30 years, IFAD had financed almost 800 development projects totalling $10 billion in investment, which had supported the poor in 115 developing countries and territories. Since the organization did not have country representatives, \"for us, partnership is fundamental\", and IFAD worked with United Nations bodies, Governments, non-governmental organizations and civil society. It recognized that indigenous peoples had their own identity, and distinct natural and cultural assets. Describing three pillars of work, he first highlighted projects and programmes at the country level. Country programmes were guided by national policy frameworks and development goals, as well as IFAD corporate policies. The IFAD also focused its work on advocacy and policy dialogue, as well as on a relatively new instrument that provided support directly to indigenous peoples: the Indigenous Peoples Assistance Facility. Regarding advocacy, IFAD had partnered with both the Forum and the inter-agency support group, he said, adding, \"We deeply value these partnerships.\" The IFAD had provided a total of $500,000. It supported indigenous institutions and had provided $1 million to support their advocacy and policy work, particularly on issues related to indigenous women. Turning to the loans and grants programme, he said that over the past six years, 20 per cent of lending to Governments had directly benefited indigenous peoples and their territories. There were 91 ongoing projects in 27 countries. Projects had focused on access to traditional lands; promoting indigenous women's actions in community affairs; enhancing livelihoods through sustainable resource management; valuing traditional knowledge systems; and support for bilingual and cross-cultural communications. The IFAD had conducted desk reviews of projects in Latin America and the Caribbean in 2007, and in Asia in 2008. He acknowledged, however, that more needed to be done in three areas: securing indigenous peoples' access to lands and territories; systematically documenting indigenous peoples' best practices in dealing with climate change; and supporting local conservation efforts, particularly by identifying species to be protected. On the policy front, the IFAD Executive Board in 2008 had approved a policy focused on securing access to land. Its guiding principles included that of free, prior and informed consent on investment projects in development activities. Another element of IFAD's engagement with indigenous communities was through the Indigenous Peoples Assistance Facility, which directly their supported self-determined development, he reiterated. The Facility had provided $10,000-$30,000 for small projects designed and implemented by indigenous peoples at the grass-roots level. The Board comprised four indigenous leaders -- including the Forum's Chair -- and the facility was managed through a bidding process. All applications received by the deadline were ranked according to various guidelines. Over two years, the Facility had funded 73 micro-projects in 47 countries. It was supported by the World Bank, along with the Governments of Norway, Canada, Finland and Italy. Aside from its financial benefits, the Facility provided a way to learn about the needs and solutions, and to scout for innovation. Comments and Questions Mr. AUDINET then gave the floor to two representatives of indigenous communities that were beneficiaries of projects approved under IFAD's Indigenous Peoples Assistance Facility. TARCILA RIVERA ZEA, Centro de Culturas Ind\u00edgenas del her organization represented the Quechua and Ashanika communities of Peru. Indigenous and Amazonian women of Peru had formed 30 organizations that were working to ensure implementation of laws concerning biodiversity. An organization representing the Ashanika people in the Central Sierra -- which comprised 12 federations -- and an organization representing the Quechua people -- which comprised 12 districts -- were working with other local and community groups on biodiversity preservation. Much knowledge about biodiversity had been registered by third parties without the knowledge of the communities living in the area. It was difficult to implement legal concepts about which indigenous people were not knowledgeable. Indigenous people must be informed about the laws in their local languages. Efforts to educate the Quechua and Ashanika people had proven fruitful. Indigenous people also had to learn new ways to defend their rights at the national level. She supported IFAD's initiative, and urged donors to continue to contribute to the Fund in order to ensure follow-up on the projects, which had been difficult so far. FLORINA LOPEZ, Fundaci\u00f3n para la Promoci\u00f3n del Conocimiento Ind\u00edgena (FPCI), Panama, said her organization represented the Kuna people of Panama. The IFAD facility had promoted cooperation on traditional knowledge on small island developing States, which had directly benefited the Kuna people. That was important as such knowledge was being utilized less and less. Indigenous people were often not informed about how many small island developing States were being lost. Thanks to IFAD funding, the Kuna women's knowledge was now being used, including in field work. Tourism was becoming a significant income earner for the Kuna people, who were selling traditional arts and crafts to tourists. Women and girls had become involved in projects to promote that art, helping to maintain traditional customs while generating income. Comments and Questions Ms. CANQUI MOLLO, Forum member from Bolivia, asked for information on the relationship between indigenous peoples and the market. \"We have that kind of relationship\", she said, suggesting that experts could learn from indigenous peoples' interaction with the market. Traditional practices had helped them to \"get to where we are now\". In the 1970s, discourse had focused on new production strategies to overcome poverty, particularly in rural and indigenous communities. However, no one spoke about how indigenous peoples had been able to survive. Indeed, it had been because they had developed their own strategies. Such models could provide a foundation for new ways to interact with Governments. Also, what was the Declaration's impact on IFAD's work? Did it have recommendations on the implementation of article 42? How was IFAD's policy on engagement with indigenous peoples reflected in the country programmes? MARGARET LOKAWUA, Forum member from Uganda, focusing first on IFAD's strategic framework, asked how the organization, in its partnership with Governments, secured the inclusion of indigenous peoples in decision-making processes. How did it approach the issue of common ownership in the context of microcredit? Would IFAD's policy of engagement with indigenous peoples support securing access to land? Among major challenges in Africa was its high illiteracy rate, which stood at around 70 to 80 per cent. What were IFAD's plans for overcoming that challenge? How did IFAD promote the scaling up of isolated pilot projects, and how did it facilitate knowledge transfer among various organizations? Also, IFAD was exploring the possibility of dialogue with indigenous peoples to share ideas. What experiences did IFAD have to share in such a dialogue? United Nations Response Mr. AUDINET said the impact of the Declaration on IFAD's work at the country level depended on how countries did or did not apply it. In selecting indigenous peoples as a significant target group, the Declaration had made it easier for IFAD to have an open dialogue. The Declaration had inspired IFAD's draft policy on engagement with indigenous peoples. But the fact that some important member countries of IFAD had not approved the Declaration was, to a certain extent, an obstacle to full recognition for IFAD's Executive Board. Australia's Government had changed course and had approved the Declaration, and it could now use it as a document for guiding policy. He said that IFAD had incorporated the Declaration into its own corporate policies, and the principles of free, prior and informed consent into its Policy on Improving Access to Land and Tenure Security. IFAD's draft policy on engagement with indigenous peoples had been developed through a long process involving the Inter-Agency Support Group. There was no major opposition to it. Many countries actively supported the draft, and the Forum and other United Nations agencies were providing input. The final document would be submitted for approval to IFAD's Executive Board in September. Ms. CORDONE said IFAD had approved projects in Latin America that paid particular attention to the IFAD Policy on Improving Access to Land and Tenure Security. She pointed to a project in Honduras for rural indigenous women and small-scale farmers, as well as one in Guatemala that stressed the need to preserve the multicultural identify of indigenous peoples. The Forum called for the active involvement of indigenous staff when projects were formulated. In terms of how IFAD secured the principles of free, prior and informed consent, Mr. AUDINET said the answer had to do with how IFAD-funded projects were designed. In 2005, a workshop on tribal and indigenous peoples' perspectives on selective IFAD-funded projects had adopted conclusions, which stated, among other things, that free, prior and informed consent was, in principle, practised in those projects. Most projects supported the principles and the idea that they should be implemented with the communities involved. The IFAD was not very involved in large infrastructure projects; its projects were mainly community-driven and carried out with the consent and design of local communities. Comments and Questions ANDREAS BALTZER JORGENSEN, observer for Denmark, said IFAD's report gave slightly contradictory information on guidelines. Some parts noted satisfaction with the United Nations Development Group's Guidelines, while others focused on the need to develop other guidelines. Did IFAD plan to create specific guidelines at the regional and subregional level? Large amounts of IFAD funding were earmarked for projects in Latin America, whereas less financing was provided for projects in Asia and very little for projects in Africa. Would IFAD give more support to Africa in the future? The IFAD issued grants for one year. Did it have any plans to issue them for longer periods in order to develop closer partnerships? JENNIFER CORPUZ, Asian Caucus, thanked IFAD for including many of her organization's suggestions in the draft policy on engagement with indigenous peoples. But the policy did not include provisions for follow-up, nor any kind of monitoring mechanism. Would IFAD immediately adopt the policy with the strengthened principle of free, prior and informed consent? Did it plan to create a monitoring mechanism for implementing the policy? She strongly recommended establishment of such a body once the policy was approved. How did IFAD ensure sustainable development in indigenous communities in which IFAD projects were producing high value-added crops? ENRIQUE OCHOA, observer for Mexico , said his country broadly supported United Nations programmes that improved indigenous peoples' living conditions, emphasizing the importance of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) programme. This year, the UNFPA report attached importance to intercultural reproductive health services and the empowerment of indigenous women. On that point, Mexico launched a comprehensive campaign last year to improve indigenous women's health. It also promoted the empowerment of women and their participation in decision-making, notably at the State level. Indigenous women did not participate in such decision-making, and he suggested that the Forum open a \"space\" for them to discuss issues that impacted their rights. LARS SIGURD VALVATNE, observer for Norway, said indigenous peoples were singled out as a principal target group for IFAD's work. As the present strategic framework was nearing its end, could experts discuss ideas for the next framework as it related to indigenous peoples? ARIEL YANEZ, Confederaci \u00f3n Sindical de Comunidades Interculturales de Bolivia, wondered if IFAD would work with indigenous organizations in his area. He hoped it could work in an organic and effective manner with them, particularly small producers. He had not seen how IFAD was approaching biofuels or agro-fuels production, whose development endangered traditional seeds. How was IFAD working in that area? MARIO FLORES, Habitat Pro Association, said his people had forged the Imara identity as an economic and cultural profile. It incorporated people who had been referred to as \"peasants\"; today, their identity constituted a community. As an indigenous Imara person, he urged the Forum to work with indigenous communities without imposing anything. He called for a macro-regional development plan for each community. The incidence of mother-to-child transmission of disease must be reduced. He asked when indigenous communities would be taken into account in development projects. Mr. BALKASSM, Forum member from Morocco, said IFAD's role vis-\u00e0-vis indigenous peoples was linked to reducing poverty. It should be possible to reduce poverty, provided that international institutions participated in partnerships. He wondered whether IFAD monitored, through its projects, what was happening to traditional lands. Did the agency work with small enterprises? Was it possible to increase the budget or open the field to cooperation, now that the Declaration had been adopted? United Nations Response Responding to the question about the share of investment devoted to indigenous peoples in Africa, Mr. AUDINET said the percentage was smaller than compared to Latin America or Asia. In Africa, the process of self-identification as indigenous people was still ongoing. Many communities did not want to use that term because it created conflict. Among those who did so were pastoralists and hunter-gatherers. That might change. Regarding IFAD's one-year small grants, he said the idea to extend them into two years was being considered by the Board. Those were small instruments that complemented broader work, he added. To a query about an independent monitoring mechanism, he said IFAD had an independent Office of Evaluation. There was an idea to establish an indigenous peoples' forum at the IFAD Governing Council, which would be discussed and hopefully approved in September. Regarding the complaint mechanism, it had been decided not to include it in IFAD policy, as the potential establishment of an indigenous forum would include that function. Taking up agro-fuels, he said IFAD did not promote such fuel in any country. However, where rural populations were interested in promoting products that fit their local markets, it did not object to the use of agro-fuels for that purpose. As to how IFAD's next strategic framework would include indigenous issues, he said IFAD would soon develop its new policy, and indigenous peoples would figure prominently in that work. Ms. CORDONE, IFAD's Coordinator for Indigenous and Tribal Issues Policy Division, added that, in September 2006, before the Declaration had been adopted, the Forum Chair had presented thoughts before the IFAD executive board. She stressed that in addressing indigenous issues, IFAD wished to have indigenous representatives add their voice to any presentations. Ms. LOKAWUA, Forum member from Uganda, thanking the experts for their comprehensive presentations, said it was paramount that IFAD continued giving loans to programmes at country and regional levels. She also hoped it would fund projects that raised awareness of indigenous peoples' rights and values. Ms. CANQUI MOLLO, Forum member from Bolivia, wondered how long IFAD's mechanism for indigenous peoples would survive. Efforts should be made to ensure that beneficiaries were indigenous peoples themselves, and not intermediaries. Interactive Dialogue Featured in the afternoon's dialogue were Purnima Mane, Deputy Executive Director of UNFPA; Technical Division; and Aminata Toure, Officer-in-Charge of UNFPA's Culture, Gender and Human Rights Branch. Kicking off the discussion, Ms. MANE said UNFPA had intensified its efforts to promote and mainstream a culturally sensitive approach to its programmes at the global, regional and national levels, in line with the Forum's recommendations. That approach -- which furthered human rights principles through respect for different traditions, cultural backgrounds and ethical values -- was central to its work for dealing with indigenous issues. By way of example, UNFPA was learning how to better deliver \"intercultural\" reproductive health information, education and services that respected indigenous peoples' world views and cultures, she said. Its programmes aimed to improve the reproductive health of indigenous peoples, with a focus on both reducing maternal mortality and empowering indigenous women to advocate for their own reproductive rights. It had long supported interventions that helped to provide indigenous women with quality health care -- including emergency obstetric care -- in such countries as Bolivia, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Viet Nam. She said important results had been seen in inter-cultural health models that involved traditional midwives and indigenous healers acting as \"cultural brokers\" between indigenous world views on health and Western medical practices. The UNFPA also carried out data collection and evidence-based studies, and worked to strengthen bilingual literacy programmes. The UNFPA was also aware that indigenous peoples' perception of the world was central to their identity and that development policies must reinforce that understanding. Assuring indigenous people the space to become architects of their own development was essential. The UNFPA was committed to the Declaration, she said, adding that its adoption -- coupled with the support it had received from Governments -- had been a key for UNFPA's work on indigenous issues. She looked forward to building on the recommendations to be made by the Forum. Speaking next, JORGE PARRA, UNFPA representative from Ecuador, said indigenous peoples' access to professional attendance at birth was 30 per cent, versus 70 per cent in non-indigenous populations. School attendance was 2.5 years for indigenous women. As for UNFPA's work, he said the agency aligned itself with Ecuador's national priorities. The UNFPA sought to ensure that an inter-cultural approach prevailed in public policy. In that context, there was a need for variables that covered indigenous peoples in the national census. To address that issue, a technical committee had been created to gather data on indigenous people. In health matters, he said indigenous people viewed health, including reproductive health, holistically and UNFPA had developed a holistic health system to complement Western medical practice. In addition, UNFPA was working to combat gender-based violence, often a hidden problem, notably by strengthening indigenous women's organizations. The challenges ahead included the creation of public policies with greater social inclusion, space for dialogue between indigenous peoples and Governments, and strengthened participation of indigenous women in various aspects of life. ALFONSO SANDOVAL, UNFPA representative from Mexico, said 43 per cent of that country's population lived in poverty; 14 per cent in abject poverty. Some 12 million people were indigenous, belonging to 68 ethno-linguistic groups, six of which constituted more than half of that population. However, there were gaps in the information collected in demographic surveys. Changes among indigenous populations were occurring: fertility and mortality were falling, and their participation in migration flows -- notably to the United States -- was increasing. More than one third of them lived outside traditional territories. At the same time, maternal mortality was three times that of non-indigenous women, mainly due to a lack of culturally adequate services. He said UNFPA supported projects in reproductive health services through federal and State institutions, as well as by developing community-based health care models, in Chiapas and Oaxaca, for example. The UNFPA also promoted and participated in efforts to better use of socio-demographic information. There were three challenges: achieving full integration of indigenous peoples' needs in all statistical and demographic systems; mainstreaming the approach to human rights in cooperation for development; and strengthening indigenous peoples' access to services dealing with reproductive health and gender equality. BRUCE CAMPBELL, UNFPA Representative in Viet Nam, said Viet Nam had almost 85 million people, including 54 major ethnic groups who lived mainly in border and mountainous regions. Most of the Millennium Development Goals had already been attained in Viet Nam. There were large discrepancies, however, in progress among indigenous peoples. Ethnic minorities had poverty rates three times higher than those of the rest of the population. Maternal mortality rates were also much higher among ethnic minorities than the rest of the population. The Government had made efforts to redress those imbalances. The UNFPA had a top-down approach to education and to training health-care workers. Despite those efforts, in areas with large populations of ethnic groups, there was a lower utilization rate than in the rest of the country. The UNFPA started a midwives training programme and had recruited ethnic minorities to work in its programme field offices. Between 1 and 15 April, it had completed a population and housing census in Viet Nam, which included details on ethnic minorities. Still, there was no simple answer, he said. The UNFPA could not just train midwives and expect them to deliver women in their homes, as some needed emergency obstetric care. The UNFPA was looking at the challenge of trying to encourage health-care services close to home, while also giving women access to services farther away. It was working to create a systematic dialogue with women in their reproductive years about reproductive health education. There was no one-size-fits-all approach to minorities. The UNFPA was working towards a strategy that was flexible enough to address each of Viet Nam's 54 ethnic groups. Comments and Questions PAIMANACH HASTEH, Forum member from Iran, asked how UNFPA perceived the Declaration's impact on its overall work. The Forum had issued specific recommendations on implementing article 42 -- did UNFPA intend to collaborate with the Forum in that regard? In cases of favourable political conditions, how did UNFPA ensure the principle of free, prior and informed consent in local and national health policy? In cases of State reluctance, how did it secure indigenous peoples' participation in public policy decision-making? In what Latin American and Asian countries had UNFPA been most effective in its work on indigenous issues? Posing another set of questions, LILIANE MUZANGI, Forum member from the Congo, wondered, in the context of article 42, how UNFPA would approach challenges vis-\u00e0-vis children, health, gender and youth. In the context of health, stereotypes existed, and she wondered how UNFPA worked in the context of article 24. In other matters, she said indigenous peoples possessed knowledge that could sometimes prevent natural disasters. Could UNFPA cite an instance in which the integration of that knowledge had been used to protect livelihoods? Mr. BALKASSM, Forum member from Morocco, taking up a point made by the representative of Ecuador on the need for complementary health services, said some countries sought to end traditional practices through their assimilation policies. Did UNFPA do any work with traditional medicinal plants, which were sometimes marketed without indigenous peoples' consent? Also, Mexico had played an important role in achieving the Declaration, but there was disturbing data cited in UNFPA's review of that country. Did the agency plan to use the \"partnership\" slogan between the Fund, indigenous people and the Mexican Government to address Mexico's situation? United Nations Response Mr. HAUG said the Declaration had already impacted UNFPA's work. The UNFPA was starting to much more seriously consider the situation of ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples. Its programming very seriously took into account issues of equity. Indigenous peoples were concerned with inequities in terms of poverty and cultural differences. The UNFPA should continue training staff and implementation partners in its member countries so that they understood the full importance and relevance of those concerns. The UNFPA was a member of the Inter-Agency Support Group on Indigenous Issues. It cooperated closely on the formulation of inter-agency guidelines, which had been disseminated to UNFPA staff and integrated into indigenous peoples' issues in UNFPA's country programmes. Many UNFPA offices had distributed the text of the Declaration, including in indigenous peoples' languages, in Latin America and Viet Nam. It had also helped disseminate the Declaration in China. Ms. TOURE said UNFPA was developing practices through in-depth consultations with line ministries in the countries it served, in order to include indigenous peoples' views in UNFPA's core programming process. All programmes stressed a human rights-based approach and focused on securing the consent and direct involvement of indigenous peoples in all programming. Governments must be key partners in that approach. It was important that the needs and rights of indigenous peoples be reflected in housing censuses. Otherwise it would be difficult to address their needs in pilot projects. In all countries in which it worked, UNFPA played the role of honest broker between Governments, civil society and indigenous peoples' organizations. For example, in Panama, after 10 years of working with indigenous women on reproductive cultural health through a pilot project, a maternal mortality strategy had been developed, which reflected indigenous women's rights. LILY RODRIGUEZ, UNFPA representative from Ecuador, asserted that most progress on indigenous peoples' rights had been made in Latin America. Sometimes, circumstances had made it easier to do that, such as democratic Governments taking power. In Latin America, it had been easier to move ahead with recognition of indigenous peoples' rights in Constitutions, for example. Regarding indigenous women's access to health services, she said that when UNFPA asked indigenous women why they were not using those services, they said that was due to geographical distance, poverty and discrimination towards them in the health-care system. The UNFPA was now working with them to break down cultural barriers in health-care services, which was essential for reducing maternal mortality. In Viet Nam, Bangladesh, Panama and Ecuador, UNFPA was working on such inter-cultural approaches, stressing the leadership role of indigenous women at the national and regional levels. In Ecuador, UNFPA had an inter-agency body to work with other United Nations bodies on cultural diversity. Ms. TOURE said UNFPA's integrated approaches focused on advancing gender equality, a human rights-based platform and being culturally sensitive to issues of concern. For example, in Kenya, the practice of female genital mutilation was common among some minorities as a rite of passage into womanhood. The UNFPA was developing dialogues with many groups to convince them of the negative consequences of such practices on women's health. The UNFPA had reached agreement with them that they would develop an alternative rite of passage, where cultural practices would be maintained, but the genital cutting would stop. Mr. PARRA said UNFPA tried to establish reproductive health-care services for indigenous peoples as a right. It was carrying out activities to have a rights-based health-care system that respected traditional medicines and health-care practices as long as they were not harmful. The UNFPA was trying to rescue the traditional health-care knowledge of indigenous peoples and complement it with Western health care. Mr. SANDOVAL said UNFPA did not have the power to take action on issues concerning patents and trademarks of health-care knowledge. But at the local level, it did try to integrate traditional medicinal practices and knowledge into Western medicine. The Mexican Ministry of Health had an inter-cultural programme that embraced and called for such integration in all areas of health care. HENIA DAKKAK, Humanitarian Response Branch, UNFPA, said UNFPA was incorporating indigenous peoples' knowledge into its natural disaster risk-reduction policies as part of efforts to develop national emergency response preparedness. Comments and Questions Ms. HASTEH, Forum member from Iran, next asked how UNFPA was incorporating a culturally sensitive approach to health services in the countries where it had a presence, in line with the Forum's recommendations from its fifth session. What obstacles had been encountered? Also, how had UNFPA contributed to the empowerment of indigenous women's organizations and networks? Regarding population data, how had UNFPA contributed to data collection, dissemination and use? Finally, she wondered how UNFPA had worked to prevent HIV/AIDS among indigenous peoples, particularly youth. What main lessons had been learned in that work? Ms. MUZANGI, Forum member from the Congo, said that in the context of the Millennium Development Goals, the fifth session deplored that the indigenous dimension had been left out of poverty reduction strategy papers. The Forum had asked that situation to be remedied. Had UNFPA done that? Had progress been made? Also, turning to diseases, such as malaria, which could spike in relation to climate change, she asked about UNFPA efforts in that area. United Nations Response Responding, AZZA KARAM, UNFPA Senior Cultural Adviser, said that the agency saw culture as all the ways that impacted peoples' thoughts, actions and beliefs. Prior to designing any programme, UNFPA took into account the surrounding political legal and other contexts; identified Government and community-based actors, including their specific needs and concerns; ensured appropriate consultation at all stages with those actors; and held itself accountable to the language -- including body language - exhibited by its partners. Moreover, for years, UNFPA had developed its own staff capacities through that cultural lens. Without the participation of indigenous peoples, UNFPA's work would be valueless. Mr. CAMPBELL said UNFPA tried to recruit indigenous peoples where possible and to ensure that their needs were reflected in all UNFPA discussions. He drew attention to the inherent challenge of addressing culture, human rights and gender issues. \"There is no quick fix\", he said. It was a bottom-up process that required patience. SONIA HECKADON, Regional Desk Adviser for Latin America and the Caribbean, UNFPA, drew attention to the agency's work with indigenous organizations, saying that, in the past year, UNFPA had strengthened an indigenous women's network in South America. Links to such networks were very important, as they quickly spread pertinent information. Comments and Questions Ms. RIVERA ZEA, CHIRAPAQ, Peru, said indigenous women were empowering themselves to have an impact on national and international policies. Progress had been considerable. The UNFPA should continue to ensure that progress in preventing maternal deaths was tracked. Closing Remarks In her closing remarks, Ms. MANE said today's dialogue had been a unique experience -- a \"turning point\" in UNFPA's collaboration with the Forum. UNFPA's report attempted to capture the work of field offices, which she hoped would help provide more coherent responses to indigenous peoples' needs worldwide. National indicators often hid huge disparities among indigenous groups. She renewed UNFPA's efforts to create a more meaningful, culturally pertinent role for indigenous peoples in development processes. \"Nothing about you, without you\", she concluded. Speaking on behalf of Forum members, Ms. HASTEH thanked the panel for its presentations. She hoped that indigenous peoples would be mainstreamed as much as possible in UNFPA's future programmes. Ms. CANQUI MOLLO, Forum member from Bolivia, said indigenous peoples often were not specifically addressed in agency reports. The UNFPA had explained some of the barriers. On the issue of censuses, some Latin American countries might avoid questions pertaining to indigenous peoples. The UNFPA must not be a part of that. It must ensure that countries incorporate indigenous peoples in the 2010 census. For information media not an official record "}
