It's kind of ironic: you wash your clothes, [sheets](https://www.thefiltery.com/best-non-toxic-bedding-sets-sheets/), and [towels](https://www.thefiltery.com/organic-towels/), expecting them to be fresh and clean, but really you just end up coating them with a bunch of synthetic chemicals that could potentially cause problems for you and your loved ones over time. The most popular laundry detergent brands carry ingredients that have been linked to everything from allergies and dry skin all the way to cancer. Even the baby and \"Free & Clear\" versions contain chemicals that pose a risk to your health. There are so many great smelling non-toxic laundry detergent brands that are completely effective, so why NOT choose the safer bet?

Our Picks at a Glance Best Overall: [Branch Detergent Sheets: Greenshield Organic](https://www.walmart.com/search?q=greenshield%20organic) What Are the Harmful Effects of Detergents? Whether or not your laundry detergent will actually cause issues depends on a lot of different factors, including age, total toxic burden, other health concerns, and more. Those who are extra sensitive or have chronic health concerns may be more likely to react negatively to the ingredients in common laundry detergents compared to those who are healthier and more equipped to process certain toxins and get them out of their bodies. Common ingredients found in conventional laundry detergents have been linked to issues like: - Skin irritation and allergies - Respiratory problems - Nervous system issues - Endocrine (hormone) disruption - Infertility - Damage to vision - Cancer - Organ damage Even those individuals who don't have strong or immediate reactions to specific brands of detergents would do well to consider switching to a safer alternative since these chemicals, especially when used in small quantities, tend to show the most damage over long periods of time (both to our bodies and to our ecosystems!). RELATED: [These are the best non-toxic cleaning products for your whole home.](https://www.thefiltery.com/best-non-toxic-cleaning-products/) Toxins in Laundry Detergent: Chemicals to Avoid Before we dive into our recommended brands, let's review some of the most common ingredients in laundry detergents that have been linked to health problems: Mystery Fragrances This is a big one when it comes to laundry detergents. Even the brands that are marketed as \"clean\" or \"green\" can contain mystery fragrances that can potentially cause problems. In the U.S., companies are legally allowed to hide almost 4,000 different chemicals under the word \"fragrance\" or \"parfum,\" without actually disclosing the ingredients to consumers. Some of these chemicals are safe, while others (like phthalates and [VOCs](https://www.thefiltery.com/volatile-organic-compounds-vocs-list/)) are known toxins. You can learn more about this issue [right here](https://www.thefiltery.com/synthetic-fragrance-hidden-toxic-chemicals/). Phthalates Phthalates are chemicals that are often used in laundry detergents to make the scents last longer. They may or may not be listed under the ingredients because they can sneak in under the \"fragrance\" label. Phthalates can be [endocrine disruptors](https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/phthalates/), which means they can interfere with hormone functioning and lead to things like infertility and cancer. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) & Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES) [SLS and SLES](https://www.thefiltery.com/is-sodium-laureth-sulfate-bad-for-hair/) were originally developed to degrease garage floors! As foaming agents and dirt removers, these are some of the most commonly used ingredients in laundry detergents as well as shampoos, [ dishwashing liquid](https://www.thefiltery.com/non-toxic-dishwasher-detergent-liquid-soap/), and other kinds of soaps. SLS and SLES have been found to irritate and inflame the skin, eyes, and lungs. While SLES is less irritating than SLS, it can be contaminated with ethylene oxide and 1,4-dioxane due to the way it's made. Ethylene oxide is known to cause multiple types of [cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/ethylene-oxide) and [infertility](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11100299/), and 1,4-dioxane is a [carcinogen](https://oehha.ca.gov/proposition-65/chemicals/14-dioxane). Although ethoxylated ingredients are practically impossible to avoid completely, it's something to consider reducing your exposure to when possible. Phosphates Some evidence links phosphates to illnesses such as [cardiovascular disease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21406296/). Not only that, but when they end up in our wastewater systems, phosphates can interfere with the ecosystems necessary for aquatic life health and survival. Formaldehyde Most of us know about formaldehyde because it's used to preserve dead bodies, but it's also commonly found in many laundry detergents. According to the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-09/documents/formaldehyde.pdf), formaldehyde is a class B1 probable carcinogen, which means it can probably cause cancer. (Although formaldehyde occurs naturally in our bodies and environments, its problems arise when included in products at high amounts.) Chlorine Bleach Most of us know that bleach is toxic, but many don't know just how dangerous it can be. It's often found in laundry detergents, especially ones meant for white loads. [Chlorine](https://www.healthline.com/health/chlorine-poisoning) bleach can cause burns, pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), respiratory failure, and other health conditions. Dioxane This has been a known [carcinogen](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/general-info/known-and-probable-human-carcinogens.html) since 1988. It can cause skin, eye, and lung inflammation. Nonylphenol Ethoxylates (NPEs) The [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/assessing-and-managing-chemicals-under-tsca/fact-sheet-nonylphenols-and-nonylphenol-ethoxylates) states that NPEs have been linked to hormonal problems, cancer, and infertility, and can also cause severe harm to aquatic life when it reaches waterways. UV/Optical Brighteners Brighteners are used to make fabrics look whiter and brighter. They're also used to treat (read: hide) stains by coating fabric with a substance that reflects light. These brighteners can irritate skin, eyes, and lungs, and can harm aquatic life as well. Other potentially problematic ingredients to watch out for are: - Ammonium Laureth Sulfate (ALES) - Ammonium Quaternary Sanitizers - Benzyl Acetate - Artificial Colors, Dyes, and Preservatives What Else To Consider When Shopping for Natural Laundry Detergent In addition to safe ingredients, you may want to consider other factors, such as: - Your personal preferences (do you like liquid, powder, tablets, pods, or sheets the best?) - Other sustainability initiatives (low-waste packaging, give-back programs, refillable options, etc.) - Your specific needs (Do you want a subscription model? Do you need something with strong stain-fighting capabilities? Do you have anyone in your family with allergies?) The Safest Non-Toxic & Natural Laundry Detergent Brands (That Actually Work!) All of that may be overwhelming, but the good news is that there is no shortage of natural, non-toxic, and great-smelling laundry soaps and detergents on the market. So, what is the safest laundry detergent? All of the following brands are free from ingredients that are potentially toxic and safe to use. [Branch Basics](https://links.branchbasics.com/thefiltery) (Best Overall) Price: $65 for Laundry Starter Kit; $22-55 for refills Carries: Laundry detergent, oxygen booster, wool dryer balls Certifications: MADE SAFE, EWG Verified (Environmental Working Group), Leaping Bunny Branch Basics concentrated formula is one of the most popular [multi-purpose](https://www.thefiltery.com/natural-non-toxic-all-purpose-cleaner/) non-toxic cleaning products.

[Blueland](https://www.blueland.com/collections/laundry) (Best Low-Waste/Plastic-Free) Price: $18 for Laundry Essentials Starter Set; $14+ for detergent refills Carries: Laundry tablets, oxi booster, wool dryer balls Certifications: EWG Verified, B Corp, Carbon Neutral Blueland carries EWG-verified non-toxic and eco-friendly laundry detergent, oxi boosts, and dryer balls (along with other products like dishwasher detergent, all-purpose household cleaners, hand soap, and more).

But don't worry: it still really works\u2014you can even check out their testing process [here](https://www.blueland.com/articles/how-effective-are-bluelands-laundry-tablets)!

EcoRoots, however, has a safe option for detergent sheets that work! Ultra-concentrated and lightweight, they come in Fresh Breeze or Fragrance-Free and are super easy to use. They're biodegradable, vegan, cruelty-free, and hypoallergenic.

[9 Elements](https://rstyle.me/+xmyIimJ7Hinm8a6cQa0tTw) (Best at Target) Price: $13 Carries: Liquid laundry detergent, fabric softener Certifications: None Many of the \"green\" laundry detergent brands that are available at big box stores are not as non-toxic or eco-friendly as they might seem. 9 Elements, however, is a pretty good brand. Available in Lemon and Eucalyptus, it only contains 9 ingredients (hence the name) and is scented with natural scents instead of synthetic fragrances. The next time you run out of detergent and don't have time to order anything online, you can feel safe grabbing a bottle of 9 Elements at the store.

It's made almost entirely of certified and plant-based ingredients, in either Free & Clear or Lavender. What About the Best Detergent for Eczema & Sensitive Skin? Actually, all of the detergents listed above would be good choices for those with [sensitive skin](https://www.thefiltery.com/clothing-dermatitis-rash-allergy/) or eczema since their ingredients are free from harsh chemicals, allergens, and skin irritants. That being said, since some individuals react differently to various ingredients (even some natural ones!), you may still have to do some trial and error to figure out what's best for your or your loved ones' skin. Best 100% Chemical-Free Option: [Magnetic Laundry System](https://www.thefiltery.com/laundry-magnets-review/) If you're looking for an unconventional laundry detergent alternative that's completely free from all chemicals, you might want to check out the Magnetic Laundry System. You can read more about it and check out our full review [here](https://www.thefiltery.com/laundry-magnets-review/). Best He Detergents: All of the above! Unless otherwise indicated, all of the above detergents are compatible with He washing machines, so you can feel good using any of them! Best Free And Clear Detergent If you're looking for a \"Free & Clear\" detergent, then all of the recommended brands above would fit that category since they're all safe, free of potentially harmful ingredients, and clear of allergens and toxins. But what about the Free & Clear versions of more conventional brands of detergent such as Tide, Gain, etc? Unfortunately, most of the time, these brands are guilty of greenwashing (marketing something as eco-friendly/natural/non-toxic when it's really not), and these \"Free & Clear\" detergents still don't make the cut when it comes to toxicity. We recommend steering clear of the conventional brands altogether if possible, and choosing one of the truly non-toxic brands above instead. More Healthy & Non-Toxic Laundry Detergent Brands There is truly no shortage of safe and effective laundry detergent brands on the market. Here are even more brands we brands are \"pretty good,\" but they do have a couple of questionable ingredients, so they don't quite make the cut for us. - BioKleen* - Cleancult - Tru Earth - Brandless - Puracy - Earth Breeze - Ecos* - EcoMe* The Sneaky Brands! These are the brands that come off as \"natural\" or \"eco-friendly\" but in fact contain several different problematic ingredients: - Mrs. Meyer's - Method* - Charlie's Soap - 365* - The Laundress - Grove Collaborative - Caldrea - Everspring - Lazy Coconut *The brands with asterisks have some products that are better than others. Some of their specific products are safe while others are not. Other Commonly Asked Questions About \"Non-Toxic\" Laundry Detergent Which Laundry Detergents Are Toxic? Here are the laundry detergents that don't even come close to making the cut when it comes to ingredient safety. (Notice that many of them have products targeted for babies and children!) - Ajax - All - Arm & Hammer (with the exception of regular baking soda and their Super Washing Soda Detergent Booster & Household Cleaner) - Cheer - Clorox - Downy - Dreft - Dynamo - Era - Fab - Gain - Kirkland - LA's - OxyClean - Persil - Resolve - Shout - Suavitel - Sun - The Laundress - Tide - Up & Up (Target) - Great Value (Walmart) - Xtra Is Seventh Generation Laundry Detergent Safe? Seventh Generation, Mrs. Meyer's, and Method laundry detergent are perhaps the three most popular brands that are marketed as \"eco-friendly\" or \"natural,\" but are in fact guilty of greenwashing. You'll notice that Mrs. Meyer's and Method are on our \"Sneaky\" list above; they don't even make the cut for the \"Just Okay\" list. Seventh Generation, however, is a little bit different because while many of their products contain problematic ingredients, they also carry several products that are perfectly safe. So with this brand, it's good practice to consider the products on a case-by-case basis. The good thing about these brands is that they're often widely available at stores like Target and Walmart, so they may be a good option if you need to pick something up at the store. Here are the Seventh Generation products that are generally safe to use (note that the baby detergents are not on this list!): - Seventh Generation 3-In-1 Oxy Booster Packs, Free & Clear - Seventh Generation Chlorine-Free Bleach, Free & Clear - Seventh Generation Ultra Power Plus Laundry Detergent Packs - Seventh Generation Zero Plastic Tablets, Fragrance Free - Seventh Generation Laundry Detergent Packs - Seventh Generation Natural Laundry Detergent Powder, Free & Clear Should You DIY Laundry Detergent? Because of the fact that there are so many non-toxic, and affordable options, you don't necessarily need to make your own. But if you enjoy DYI-ing, there are some great, safe recipes for laundry detergent, like [this one on DIY Natural](https://www.diynatural.com/homemade-laundry-detergent-soap/)! What About Non-Toxic Dryer Sheets? Just like with laundry detergent, [dryer sheets](https://www.thefiltery.com/non-toxic-alternatives-dryer-sheets-static-smell/) can contain a lot of hidden ingredients that can potentially cause harm. Because they're so concentrated, they can actually be even worse than the detergent itself. Check out [this article](https://www.thefiltery.com/non-toxic-alternatives-dryer-sheets-static-smell/) for more information about non-toxic alternatives to dryer sheets. Conclusion With so many safe options, there is no reason you can't stock your laundry room with clean and fresh-smelling detergents that won't pose harm to you or your family and can still get rid of stubborn stains!
