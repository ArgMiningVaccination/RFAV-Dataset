They should not be relied on to guide clinical practice or health-related behavior and should not be reported in news media as established information. Preprints posted online allow authors to receive rapid feedback and the entire scientific community can appraise the work for themselves and respond appropriately. Those comments are posted alongside the preprints for anyone to read them and serve as a post publication assessment. Relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of mRNA COVID-19 boosters in the UK vaccination programme, during the Spring-Summer (monovalent vaccine) and Autumn-Winter 2022 (bivalent vaccine) test medrxiv; SARS-CoV-2 infection is an urgent [public health]priority. A precise comparison of the rVE of monovalent and bivalent boosters given during the 2022 Spring-Summer and Autumn-Winter campaigns, respectively, in a defined [population]has not been reported. We therefore assessed rVE against hospitalisation for the Spring-Summer (fourth vs third monovalent controls and 182 cases were included in the Spring-Summer booster [analysis]; 572 controls and 152 cases for the booster [mRNA]bivalent [COVID-19 vaccine]doses demonstrated benefit as [mRNA]boosters given earlier in the year. These findings support the current UK immunisation programme that advises the use of bivalent booster doses. MEDLINE ... LILACS LIS "}
