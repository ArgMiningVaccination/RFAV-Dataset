Students who have been admitted to USFSM and their major area of study may visit their advisor. All students are expected to establish an advising relationship and periodically visit their advisors to keep abreast of any policy, procedural, or curriculum changes that may affect them. Some colleges require advisor approval of student programs each semester. All undergraduate students on Academic Probation (undergraduate GPA less than 2.00) are required to meet with the Persistence Advisor to develop an academic standing agreement. It is important for students to keep in mind that although the University provides advising services to assist students with academic planning, it is each student's responsibility to see that all graduation requirements are met. DegreeWorks Website: degreeworks.usf.edu DegreeWorks is the USF System-wide computer-assisted advising tool that provides personalized reports to assist with advice, student success, and planning for graduation. DegreeWorks creates personalized reports by matching the student's academic record (both USF System and transfer courses) with the requirements of the student's degree program. Students can use the \"What If\" option to explore different degree programs by creating a tailored curriculum including majors, concentrations, and minors. The \"Look Ahead\" feature is available for students to see how a proposed schedule of classes will be used toward completing their degree. Students with questions about DegreeWorks should contact their academic advisor. Please note, DegreeWorks is not an official transcript and is not an official notification of completion of degree. Students should refer to the Academic Catalog to review degree requirements for their program.

Tutoring and writing consultations are provided free of charge to all students actively enrolled at USFSM. Currently, tutoring is available in Writing, Math, Statistics, Accounting, Finance, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, American Sign Language (ASL) and Spanish. Writing consultants help individual writers think through their work, understand the writing process, and develop strategies for planning, drafting, and revising. They help writers during all stages of the writing process; however, the goal of writing consultation is to help students learn to revise their own work, concentrating primarily on content, argumentation (thesis or focus), development, organization, and to a lesser extent format (APA, MLA, Chicago Style, etc.). Although writing consultants can help writers identify and address problems with grammar, punctuation, mechanics, etc., they do not edit, proofread, or \"correct\" papers. Peer tutors are undergraduate and graduate students who have met rigorous eligibility requirements. All student tutors are recommended by faculty and are trained to assist their peers in comprehending challenging concepts and grappling with complex ideas. 14 Library Services Location: C203B Library Services provides in-person and online library instruction.

Students with Disabilities Services Location: Accommodations (Public/Employees/Students) In accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act and the ADA Amendments Act, Students with Disabilities Services (SDS) is dedicated to providing reasonable accommodations to 20 students with disabilities to ensure full participation in all aspects of USFSM campus and student life. Reasonable accommodations are provided for students with temporary or permanent disabilities. The student initiates the process by identifying herself/himself to the SDS office and completing an application. Students must provide documentation of a disability. Please visit our website for guidelines and verification forms. All documentation is reviewed by the professional staff of SDS and, when necessary, reviewed by consultants with expertise in specific disability areas. In some cases, students are requested to provide more documentation than originally submitted. In cases where documentation is not available, please consult with SDS. Once approved, the SDS coordinator and the student will sign an accommodation plan outlining academic accommodations. Each semester the student is responsible for giving each of her/his professors a memorandum of accommodation. Accommodations may include, but are not limited to, note taking services, extended test time, books in electronic/audio format, and assistive technology. The accommodations should maintain the academic integrity of the course and never alter the level of ability or mastery the individual is required to demonstrate. 21 Catalog Applicability The catalog is an outline of the academic offerings and related processes for general reference. Every effort has been made to ensure that the information contained in the Catalog is accurate. However, the University is a dynamic entity and change may occur during the term between Catalog publications. Accordingly, students should avail themselves of the most current publications available online including the most current Regulations and Policies and to request any updates to the catalog or related information. Since expected changes may occur during the academic year, the listings, descriptions, course offerings and information on costs in this catalog do not constitute a guarantee on behalf of the University. The University reserves the right to correct clerical and /or typographical errors. USF Policy #10-059 I. PURPOSE & INTENT University of South Florida System (USF System) institutions publish undergraduate and graduate catalogs on each campus. Catalogs are not contracts, but are the source of general information including the USF System, its campuses, community, curricular offerings, degree and admission requirements, academic calendar, and facilities available to students, faculty and staff. II. STATEMENT OF POLICY The USF System member institutions reserve the right to change or modify academic requirements, course information, and curricula as authorized by the USF Board of Trustees, Florida Board of Governors or Florida law. Revisions to catalogs will not alter provisions, terms, fees, or requirements under existing University regulations or policies. The catalogs are revised each academic year according to each respective institution's faculty council decisions. The catalogs will be updated without notice as degree programs or curricula changes are approved by the appropriate USF System authority, the Florida Board of Governors or Florida law. In the event of conflict between any provisions in the catalogs and any USF System regulations or policies, the document most currently revised or adopted by the USF Board of Trustees shall prevail. A degree-seeking student may choose any USF catalog (of the institution in which they are enrolled) published during his/her continuous enrollment. As degree-seeking students will be enrolled over the course of several terms, the catalogs may change. In the event of a conflict, to the extent possible, the University will make every effort to apply the appropriate catalog that protects the interest of the student. However, in the case of policy and program changes, or issues of accreditation and legislative changes, the most current catalog will be applied, if necessary. III. APPLICABILITY & AUTHORITY Each Institution will follow its established annual catalog approval process, with final approval residing with the appropriate faculty councils and the Chief Academic Officer of the appropriate USF System Institution or their designee. The councils will operate with established timelines and protocols. IV. CATALOGS The catalogs are published solely on-line at the respective USF institution's website. 22 Abbreviations Requisite Abbreviations Abbreviation Term Description PR Prerequisite Prerequisite courses must be complete prior to enrolling in the next course.

A degree-seeking student may choose any USFSM catalog published during his/her continuous enrollment. Students who have transferred from one Florida public institution to another are affected by the following Department of Education policy: Graduation requirements in effect at the receiving SUS institution at the time a student enrolls at a Florida public institution of higher learning shall apply to that student in the same manner that graduation requirements apply to its native students provided the student has had continuous enrollment as defined in the SUS institution's catalog. At USFSM, \"continuous enrollment\" is defined as enrolling as a degree-seeking student at least one term each twelve month period. Therefore, students cannot choose a USFSM catalog published prior to or during an academic year in which they did not maintain continuous enrollment. (Each catalog is considered to be published during the academic year printed on the title page.) If the student cannot meet all of the graduation requirements specified in the catalog of his/her choice due to decisions and changes by the University in policy matter, course offering, etc., appropriate substitutions will be determined by the college dean of the student's major. USF System policies are subject to change and apply to all students regardless of their choice of catalog. If the student's graduation requirements are affected by changes in University policies, appropriate arrangements will be made to preclude penalization of the student. Florida's Statewide Course Numbering System Courses in this catalog are identified by prefixes and numbers that were assigned by Florida's Statewide Course Numbering System (SCNS). This numbering system is used by all public postsecondary institutions in Florida and by participating nonpublic institutions. The major purpose of this system is to facilitate the transfer of courses between participating institutions. Students and administrators can use the online SCNS to obtain course descriptions and specific information about course transfer between participating Florida institutions. This information is at the SCNS website at http://scns.fldoe.org. Each participating institution controls the title, credit, and content of its own courses and recommends the first digit of the course number to indicate the level at which students normally take the course. Course prefixes and the last three digits of the course numbers are assigned by members of faculty discipline committees appointed for that purpose by the Florida Department of Education in Tallahassee. Individuals nominated to serve on these committees are selected to maintain a representative balance as to type of institution and discipline field or specialization. The course prefix and each digit in the course number have a meaning in the SCNS. The listing of prefixes and associated courses is referred to as the \"SCNS taxonomy.\" Descriptions of the content of courses are referred to as \"statewide course profiles.\" 25 Example of Course Identifier Prefix Level Code Century Digit Decade Digit Unit Digit Lab Code (first digit) (second digit) (third digit) (fourth digit) ENC 1 1 0 1 English Lower (Freshman) Freshman Freshman Freshman No laboratory Composition Level at this institution Composition Composition Skills Composition Skills I component in this course General Rule for Course Equivalencies Equivalent courses at different institutions are identified by the same prefixes and same last three digits of the course number and are guaranteed to be transferable between participating institutions that offer the course, with a few exceptions, as listed below in Exceptions to the General Rule for Equivalency. For example, a freshman composition skills course is offered by 84 different public and nonpublic postsecondary institutions. Each institution uses \"ENC_101\" to identify its freshman composition skills course. The level code is the first digit and represents the year in which students normally take the course at a specific institution. In the SCNS taxonomy, \"ENC\" means \"English Composition,\" the the decade digit \"0\" represents \"Freshman Composition Skills,\" and the unit digit \"1\" represents \"Freshman Composition Skills I.\" In the sciences and certain other areas, a \"C\" or \"L\" after the course number is known as a lab indicator. The \"C\" represents a combined lecture and laboratory course that meets in the same place at the same time. The \"L\" represents a laboratory course or the laboratory part of a course that has the same prefix and course number but meets at a different time or place. Transfer of any successfully completed course from one participating institution to another is guaranteed in cases where the course to be transferred is equivalent to one offered by the receiving institution. Equivalencies are established by the same prefix and last three digits and comparable faculty credentials at both institutions. For example, ENC 1101 is offered at a community college. The same course is offered at a state university as ENC 2101. A student who has successfully completed ENC 1101 at a Florida College System institution is guaranteed to receive transfer credit for ENC 2101 at the state university if the student transfers. The student cannot be required to take ENC 2101 again since ENC 1101 is equivalent to ENC 2101. Transfer credit must be awarded for successfully completed equivalent courses and used by the receiving institution to determine satisfaction of requirements by transfer students on the same basis as credit awarded to the native students. It is the prerogative of the receiving institution, however, to offer transfer credit for courses successfully completed that have not been designated as equivalent. NOTE: Credit generated at institutions on the quarter-term system may not transfer the equivalent number of credits to institutions on the semester-term system. For example, 4.0 quarter hours often transfers as 2.67 semester hours. 26 The Course Prefix The course prefix is a three-letter designator for a major division of an academic discipline, subject matter area, or subcategory of knowledge. The prefix is not intended to identify the department in which a course is offered. Rather, the content of a course determines the assigned prefix to identify the course. Authority for Acceptance of Equivalent Courses Section 1007.24(7), Florida Statutes, states: Any student who transfers among postsecondary institutions that are fully accredited by a regional or national accrediting agency recognized by the United States Department of Education and that participate in the statewide course numbering system shall be awarded credit by the receiving institution for courses satisfactorily completed by the student at the previous institutions. Credit shall be awarded if the courses are judged by the appropriate statewide course numbering system faculty committees representing school districts, public postsecondary educational institutions, and participating nonpublic postsecondary educational institutions to be academically equivalent to courses offered at the receiving institution, including equivalency of faculty credentials, regardless of the public or nonpublic control of the previous institution. The Department of Education shall ensure that credits to be accepted by a receiving institution are generated in courses for which the faculty possess credentials that are comparable to those required by the accrediting association of the receiving institution. The award of credit may be limited to courses that are entered in the statewide course numbering system. Credits awarded pursuant to this subsection shall satisfy institutional requirements on the same basis as credits awarded to native students. Exceptions to the General Rule for Equivalency Since the initial implementation of the SCNS, specific disciplines or types of courses have been accepted from the guarantee of transfer for equivalent courses. These include courses that must be evaluated individually or courses in which the student must be evaluated for mastery of skill and technique. The following courses are exceptions to the general rule for course equivalencies and may not transfer. Transferability is at the discretion of the receiving institution. 1. Courses not offered by the receiving institution. 2. For courses at non-regionally accredited institutions, courses offered prior to the established transfer date of the course in question. 3. Courses in the _900-999 series are not automatically transferable, and must be evaluated individually. These include such courses as Special Topics, Internships, Apprenticeships, Practica, Study Abroad, Theses, and Dissertations. 4. Applied academics for adult education courses. 5. Graduate courses. 6. Internships, apprenticeships, practica, clinical experiences, and study abroad courses with numbers other than those ranging from 900-999. 27 7. Applied courses in the performing arts (Art, Dance, Interior Design, Music, and Theatre) and skills courses in Criminal Justice (academy certificate courses) are not guaranteed as transferable. These courses need evidence of achievement (e.g., portfolio, audition, interview, etc.). Courses at Non-regionally Accredited Institutions The SCNS makes available on its home page (http://scns.fldoe.org) a report entitled \"Courses at Non-regionally Accredited Institutions\" that contains a comprehensive listing of all non-public institution courses in the SCNS inventory, as well as each course's transfer level and transfer effective date. This report is updated monthly. Questions about the SCNS and appeals regarding course credit transfer decisions should be directed to Cynthia Brown Hernandez in the Office of Undergraduate Studies or to the Florida Department of Education, Office of Articulation, 1401 Turlington Building, Tallahassee, Florida 32399-0400. Special reports and technical information may be requested by calling the SCNS office at (850) 245-0427 or at http://scns.fldoe.org. 28 Degrees Offered Bachelor of Arts, B.A. Bachelor of Science, B.S.

The USFSM colleges therein establish certain academic requirements that must be met before a degree is granted. These requirements concern such things as curricula and courses, majors and minors, and academic residence. Advisors, directors, and deans are available to help the student understand and arrange to meet these requirements, but the student is responsible for fulfilling them. At the end of a student's course of study, if requirements for graduation have not been satisfied, the degree will not be granted. For this reason, it is important for all students to acquaint themselves with all regulations and to remain currently informed throughout their college careers and to be responsible for completing requirements. Courses, programs, and requirements described in the catalog may be suspended, deleted, restricted, supplemented, or changed in any other manner at any time at the sole discretion of the University and the USF System Board of Trustees. 29 Locations USFSM Campus The USFSM campus on the edge of Manatee and Sarasota counties is located in a very special part of Florida, where students enjoy natural beauty, diverse arts and culture and a passion for excellence.

In this section... General Undergraduate Policies & Regulations Graduate Policies & Regulations 33 General These policies apply to both undergraduate and graduate students. Academic Grievance Procedures for Students USF Policy 10-002: Academic Grievance Procedures for Students Student Grievance Form I. PURPOSE & INTENT The purpose of this Policy is to provide all undergraduate and graduate students taking courses within the University of South Florida System (USF System) an opportunity for objective review of facts and events pertinent to the cause of the academic grievance. II. STATEMENT OF POLICY Review of the facts and events pertinent to the cause of the academic grievance will be accomplished in a collegial, non-judicial atmosphere rather than an adversarial one, and shall allow the parties involved to participate. All parties will be expected to act in a professional and civil manner. These guidelines are meant to govern all colleges (exclusive of the MD and DPT programs within the College of Medicine and the College of Pharmacy to the extent they maintain procedures and processes for issues regarding professionalism). However, USF System institutions may have unique titles and specific administrative levels. Accordingly, each institution shall determine the appropriate levels and titles for review at the time a student initiates an appeal ensuring that if it is determined the matter is an academic grievance there is at least one committee level review and recommendation to an administrator to accept or reject. In the case of Academic Integrity violations, the appeal or grievance of a decision or academic action regarding Academic Integrity is contained in USF3.027 Academic Integrity of Students. III. DEFINITION OF TERMS An \"academic grievance\" is a claim by an enrolled student receiving academic credit for a course that a specific academic decision or action (such as the assignment of a final grade or academic dismissal of a student or other grade assignment) has violated published policies and procedures, or has been applied to the grievant in a manner different from that used for other students. Academic grievances will not deal with general student complaints. An academic grievance must include a reference to a violation of a specific USF Policy, or an academic decision that was applied differently to the grievant than other students to be considered under this Policy. Only the final grades assigned in a course, final actions or dismissals by the academic unit are grievable. Disagreement or issues with individual test grades, responses to exam questions or general disagreement with the academic discretion or professional judgment of instructors, (defined below as including all levels of academic administrators for purposes of this Policy) will not be considered grounds for an academic grievance, except where they impact the final grade. If a student has a concern on an individual assignment, and would like some formal consideration, the student should contact the instructor to discuss the issue and may submit the concern as a general complaint in writing to the instructor. If the student and instructor cannot resolve the complaint, the student may forward the complaint to the instructor's supervisor and that 34 supervisor shall review the complaint and provide a response to both the student and instructor. If the supervisor identifies a need for a review by another office or process, the supervisor may make an additional referral. Dismissals based on University protocols such as failure to maintain GPA, probation for academic performance or other automatic administrative actions are not grievable. \"Instructor\" shall mean any classroom instructor, thesis/dissertation/directed study supervisor, or the Dean or supervisor that imposes the final academic decision. \"Department Chair/Director\" shall mean the academic head of a college department or the director of a program\u2014or in all cases a \"Department's designee\" appointed to handle academic grievances. \"Dean\" shall mean a College Dean, or the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, or the Dean of the Office of Graduate School, or the equivalent as indicated\u2014or in all cases a \"Dean's designee\" appointed to handle academic grievances for the unit. \"Time\" shall mean \"academic time,\" that is, periods when USF System classes are in session. The person vested with authority at the appropriate level may extend any of the time periods contained herein for good cause. Any extensions must be communicated in writing to all parties. For the purposes of this Policy, each step shall be afforded three (3) weeks as a standard time limit. When a department considers a grievance according to published departmental procedures approved by the College Dean and Provost or College Dean and Regional Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, as pertinent, the time line specified in this academic unit's procedures will govern the process and no additional notice of time extension is needed. \"Written communication\" shall mean communication by email to the recipient's USF official email address of record or e-mail communication using assigned USF e-mail addresses. The \"burden of proof\" shall be upon the student such that the student challenging the decision, action or final grade assigned has the burden of supplying evidence that proves that the instructor's decision was incorrect, in all cases except alleged violations of academic integrity. See USF3.027 Academic Integrity of Students. In cases where the academic decision is based on a deficiency in or a violation of a clinical or professional standard, the deficiency or violation may be considered sufficient proof to support an academic failure or dismissal notwithstanding a student's success in other areas of academic performance. \"Jurisdiction\" Where the course (not the student's registration status) is housed (e.g., payment of faculty salary for the course) determines the appropriate forum (institution, college or department) where the grievance will be conducted. The outcomes of the grievance should be shared with the home institution, College and Department (Program Director or Chair of the students major). In the case where there is a joint program or it is unclear where jurisdiction shall fall, the Provost (or designee) may be consulted to identify the appropriate forum for the grievance. If a student is dismissed from a course, program, college or institution, that forum may make an additional recommendation for a more comprehensive sanction across the System directly to the Provost. In the event there is a System level dismissal by the Provost, and a student wishes to appeal that system level action, the President may designate an administrative officer to review that appeal and make a final determination. \"Institution\" There are three member institutions in the USF System specifically referred to as USF, and USF Sarasota-Manatee (USFSM). party shall be entitled to bring \"legal representation\" to any actual grievance proceeding as this is an internal review of an academic decision. 35 IV. PROCESS STEPS: A. Resolution Process at the Course or Department Level 1. If the grievance concerns the Chairperson/Director or other officials of the department, the student has a right to bypass the departmental process and proceed directly to the College Level. 2. The student shall first make a reasonable effort to resolve his or her grievance with the instructor concerned, with the date of the incident triggering the start of the process (i.e. the issuance of a final grade) and if the instructor determines it is feasible and may be productive, the instructor shall accommodate a reasonable request to discuss and attempt to resolve this issue. 3. If the situation cannot be resolved or a meeting with the instructor is not feasible, the student must file a notification letter within three (3) weeks of the triggering incident to both the department Chairperson/Director and Dean. This shall be a concise written statement of particulars and must include specific reference to the (a) published USF Policy, procedure or official published catalog and the manner in which it was allegedly violated and the decision that affected the student's academic record or status based on a violation of that specific written USF Policy, procedure or official published catalog (b) a description of the manner in which the student was treated in a substantially inequitable manner and a statement indicating the remedy sought (c) supporting documentations of all claims in the grievance and (d) the effort the student made to resolve the issue with the instructor. 4. The department Chairperson/Director must determine if the matter is an Academic Grievance (a specific Policy violated or a student treated differently than others) or if the matter is a complaint regarding the course or instructor. 5. (a) If the Chairperson/Director determines that the matter is not an Academic Grievance, the Chairperson/Director will discuss the complaint with the student and/or the faculty member and must advise the Dean of the complaint and the recommended resolution if any. The Dean will then review the classification of the complaint as not subject to the Academic Grievance Process and advise the student and faculty member in writing of the Dean's decision which may be to do one or more of the following: 1.) Implement the recommendation of the Chairperson/Director (which can include dismissal). 2.) Reject the classification and move the matter forward as an academic grievance. 3.) Make referrals to appropriate Human Resources or employee supervisor/office for intervention and/or to appropriate USF offices (such as Diversity and Equal Opportunity Office (DEO)). (b) If the Chairperson/Director determines the matter is an Academic Grievance, the Chairperson shall provide a copy of the student's statement to the instructor. The instructor may file a written response to the grievance and the Process will continue. 6. The department Chairperson/Director shall discuss the student's statement as reference above jointly or individually with the student and the instructor to see if the grievance can be resolved. If the department maintains its own grievance procedure,* it should be applied at this point. If the grievance can be resolved, the Chairperson/Director shall provide a statement to that effect to the student and the instructor with a copy to the College Dean. 7. If the grievance cannot be resolved, the department Chair/Director shall notify both the student and the instructor, informing the student of his/her right to file a written request directed back to the Chair/Director within three weeks to move the grievance to a Formal Grievance Appeal. Upon receipt of the student's request for a Formal Grievance Appeal to the College Level and the instructor's response to the grievance (if provided), the Chairperson/Director shall immediately notify the College Dean of the Formal Grievance Appeal, providing copies of the student's initiating grievance statement, any instructor's written response to the grievance, and the written request from the student to have the process advanced to a Formal Grievance Appeal (which shall include additional 36 student responses and final statement). Should the student not file a written request to move the grievance to a Formal Grievance Appeal within the prescribed time, the grievance will end. B. Formal Grievance Appeal at the College Level 1. Upon receipt of the grievance, the College Dean will review that matter to confirm that it is an Academic Grievance. If the Dean determines the matter is not an Academic Grievance, the Dean may dismiss it (which is a final University Decision) and notify all parties in writing, or if the Dean determines that it is an Academic Grievance, within three weeks the Dean shall establish an Academic Grievance Committee. Each Dean shall appoint a College Dean or Administrator to maintain the Formal Grievance Appeals to the College Level with a recording of the final disposition. The membership of the Committee shall be constituted as follows: a. Three (3) faculty members and two (2) students (undergraduate or graduate as appropriate to the case) shall be selected from the college by the Dean. b. Wherever practical, the Committee shall not include members of the faculty or students of the department directly involved with the grievance, or faculty or students of the student's major department. However, for cases involving Clinical or Professional Standard violations, the Committee shall include, when feasible, at least one member assigned to oversee or with expertise in, a clinical area. c. The student or instructor may request to attend a Committee meeting to present a final statement to the committee. The Chairperson will designate which meeting the student or instructor may attend to present any final statement to the Committee. Only the Committee may invite additional parties such as faculty or students from the department involved with the grievance or from the student's major department or other outside party to provide expert or other relevant testimony in the proceedings. The student or instructor may be present during the other's final statement and may hear the additional information provided, however, neither may be present during the Committee's deliberations. The meeting time and place is to be set by the Committee. Failure or an inability of the student or instructor to attend a meeting will not force the meeting to be rescheduled or cancelled. d. The student or instructor may be accompanied by one individual (not to act as legal counsel or to participate in the meetings) if the student or instructor attends the meeting. The individual may be required to sign a confidentiality agreement. e. Students may not initiate contact regarding or relating to the grievance process or outcome with any member of the Committee outside of this established process before, during or after the Committee review process and any such contact may be considered a violation of USF6.0021 Student Code of Conduct. 2. The Committee will operate in the following manner: a. The Committee Chairperson will be appointed by the College Dean from among the three (3) faculty members appointed to the Committee. The Committee Chairperson shall be responsible for scheduling meetings, overseeing the deliberations of the committee and ensuring that full and fair consideration is provided to all parties. The Committee Chairperson shall vote on committee decisions only when required to break a tie. b. All deliberations shall be in private and held confidential by all members of the Committee. The recommendation of the Committee shall be based on their interpretation of the evidence presented to it. c. Within three (3) weeks of the Committee appointment, the Committee Chairperson shall deliver in writing to the College Dean a report of the findings and a recommended resolution. d. Within three (3) weeks of receipt of the Committee recommendation, the College Dean shall provide a decision in writing to all parties (the student, the instructor and the department Chair/Program Director). The Dean's decision shall indicate whether the decision was consistent with the committee recommendation. e. The College Dean's decision is a final decision and appealable by the instructor or student to the University level only in the event (1) the decision of the College Dean is contrary to the recommendation of the Committee (which will be indicated in the Dean's decision) or (2) if there is a specific and identified substantive procedural violation of these Student Academic Grievance Procedures. Such an appeal must be made in writing to the Dean of 37 Undergraduate Studies or Graduate Studies (as appropriate) or the appropriate Chief Academic Officer or their designee within three weeks of receipt of the decision from the College Dean. C. Formal Grievance Appeal at the Institution Level For this level of appeal process, the Provost/Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs or the Sr. Vice President for USF Health has delegated authority for academic grievance appeals at the Institution level to the Dean of Undergraduate Studies for appeals involving undergraduate courses and to the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies for appeals involving graduate courses. For academic grievance appeals for grades assigned in courses at USFSP or USFSM, the appropriate Regional Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs at those Institutions may delegate authority to an Academic Administrator Officer to hear the appeal at the System Level (for the purposes of this section Administrative Officer, Graduate/Undergraduate Dean are referred to as \"Administrator Officer\"). In the event there is confusion as to the home for the course or in the registration status of the student within the USF System, the Provost may designate the jurisdiction for the appeal. The process steps are outlined below. 1. The student or the instructor may appeal at the Institution Level within three (3) weeks of the receipt of a decision made at the College Level, when (1) the decision at the College Dean Level is contrary to the recommendation of the Grievance Committee (2) a party identifies a specific substantive procedural violation in the application of the AGP. Within three weeks of receipt of the appeal of the decision, the Administrative Officer shall determine that the appeal is merited (there is a recommendation at the College Level contrary to the committee or the Administrative Officer concurs that there is cause to believe a substantive procedural violation in application of the AGP process may have occurred). If the Administrative Officer determines the appeal is not merited, the Administrative Officer shall advise the student, the instructor and the department Chair accordingly and that notice shall be a final University Decision. If the appeal is determined to be merited, the Administrative Officer (who may consult with the Faculty Senate and Student Senate) shall appoint an Appeals Committee consisting of three (3) faculty members drawn from the appropriate USF System Undergraduate Council or Graduate Council, and two (2) students, undergraduate or graduate (as appropriate and to be determined by the Administrative Officer). 2. The structure, functions and operating procedures of the Appeals Committee will be the same as those of the College Committee (i.e. chaired by one of the appointed faculty members appointed by the Administrative Officer who will not vote except in the case of a tie, having no representation from either party's respective departments, developing a recommendation to the Administrative Officer, etc.). 3. Within three (3) weeks of the appointment, the Committee Chairperson shall deliver in writing to the Administrative Officer a report of the findings of the Committee and a recommended resolution. 4. Within three (3) weeks of receipt of the Committee recommendation, the Administrative Officer shall provide a decision in writing to all parties. 5. If the Administrative Officer's decision is that a grade change is merited, the Administrative Officer shall initiate the grade change on the authority of the Provost and so inform all parties. In all academic grievance appeals, the Administrative Officer's decision is a final University decision and not subject to further appeal within the USF System. In those cases where the final University decision constitutes a dismissal or permanent separation from the University, a student may seek judicial review pursuant to Florida Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.190(b)(3) by filing a petition for certiorari review with the appropriate circuit court within thirty (30) days of the final University decision. If a person seeks review with the court, a copy of the petition must also be provided to the University of South Florida Office of the General Counsel at University of South Florida, CGS 301, 4202 E. Fowler Avenue, Tampa, Florida 33620-4301. IV. OUTCOMES The final outcome will vary on an individual case basis. In the case of grade appeals, the USF System reserves the right to change a student's grade if it is determined at the conclusion of the grievance process that the grade given was incorrect. The term \"incorrect\" means the assigned grade was based on something other than performance in 38 the course, or that the assignment of the grade was not consistent with the criteria for awarding of grades as described in the course syllabus or other materials distributed to the student. In such circumstances, the Dean or Provost/Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs, the Regional Vice-Chancellor for Academic Affairs, or the Sr. Vice President, USF Health may file an administrative grade change. In the case of all other academic grievances, the USF System reserves the right to determine the final outcome based on the procedures detailed herein. Record Keeping: In the event a grievance moves to a Formal College Grievance Appeal, each College is responsible for maintaining a list of informal grievances and their final outcomes. Academic Integrity of Students USF System Regulation 3.027: Academic Integrity of Students I. PURPOSE & INTENT Academic integrity is the foundation of the University of South Florida System's (USF System) commitment to the academic honesty and personal integrity of its university community. Academic integrity is grounded in certain fundamental values, which include honesty, respect and fairness. Broadly defined, academic honesty is the completion of all academic endeavors and claims of scholarly knowledge as representative of one's own efforts. Knowledge and maintenance of the academic standards of honesty and integrity as set forth by the university are the responsibility of the entire academic community, including the instructional faculty, staff and students. The final decision on an academic integrity violation and related academic sanction at any USF System member institution shall affect and be applied to the academic status of the student throughout the USF System, unless otherwise determined by the independently accredited institution. II. STATEMENT OF REGULATION This Regulation asserts fairness in that it requires notice to any student accused of a violation of academic integrity and provides a directive for discussion between the instructor and student to seek a fair and equitable resolution. If a fair resolution is not accomplished in this discussion, this Regulation allows the student continued rights of due process. As this Regulation contemplates several levels of administrative or academic review, students are advised to direct emails only to the single designated office identified as responsible for the current level of review. Student's failure to adhere to this directive or ignoring specific directives provided by an administrator such as the emailing all levels of administration, multiple parties not directly involved, or tangentially involved offices may be interpreted as a waiver of the review/appeal process and a failure to follow university directives. As the university has both Offices of Undergraduate and Graduate Studies with different standards for academic integrity, it is important to reference Section V(D). III. APPLICABILITY & AUTHORITY A. The following Regulation applies to all students, instructional faculty and staff who participate in administration of academic classes, programs and research at the USF System. The processes outlined in this Regulation are meant to govern all colleges exclusive of the MD and DPT programs within the College of Medicine and the College of Pharmacy to the extent that they maintain procedures and processes for issues regarding academic integrity and/or professionalism. B. The Academic Integrity Review Process (AIRP) is independent of any other USF process or review. The determinations by the Academic Offices are final. However, this process includes mechanisms for referrals outside 39 of the Academic process to both the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities (OSRR) and the Division of Research, Integrity and Compliance (DRIC). Each of the offices has the authority to impose independent sanctions on the student that may be additional, less severe or more severe than the academic sanctions. The student will be subject to each sanction concurrently and/or consecutively and must comply with the full terms of each. C. The student will be assigned the grade by the instructor in the course in which the student is registered. Jurisdiction of the appeal and review stays with the course; however, if the potential sanction extends outside of the College or Academic unit where the course is housed, jurisdiction is transferred to the Academic Officer with the authority to impose the greater sancti IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS A. Notice shall be considered final upon email to a student's official USF email address. Additional notice may be sent at the discretion of the parties. B. Academic Officer (\"AO\") shall mean the individual (or their designee) vested with the authority to impose the recommended academic sanctions by the instructor. The appropriate AO may vary by institution, circumstance or factual basis of each case. In the event it is unclear, the Chief Academic Officer or their designee will identify the appropriate AO. The table below is provided as a general guideline. Academic Dishonesty occurred in: Sanction: Academic Officer (to be determined by individual cases and title may vary): Academic Officer for Academic Integrity Appeal: Course \u00b7 Grade Assignment; or\u00b7 Removal from course Instructor's Supervisor or Department Chair Dean of College Program \u00b7 Suspension; or\u00b7 Removal from Program Chair (or Director for certain Schools) Dean of College College \u00b7 Suspension; or\u00b7 Removal from College Dean of College Dean of Graduate/Undergraduate Studies or Chief Academic Officer University or Institution \u00b7 Suspension; or\u00b7 Dismissal from University Dean of Graduate/Undergraduate Studies or Chief Academic Officer Dean of Graduate/Undergraduate Studies or Chief Academic Officer C. Dean shall mean a College Dean, or where applicable the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, Dean of Graduate Studies, or the Chief Academic Officer (for those Institutions that do not have a Dean of Undergraduate or Graduate Studies) or the equivalent as indicated - or in all cases a \"Dean's designees\" appointed to handle academic grievances for the unit. 40 D. Academic Integrity Review Board (\"AIRB\"): The committee that will be appointed by the Academic Officer to review the Academic Integrity finding and sanction as referenced in Section VII (2). E. Academic Integrity Review Process (\"AIRP\"): The steps described in this Regulation that govern how an Academic Integrity violation will be charged, appealed and determined. F. Student Academic Integrity Committee (\"SAIC\"): The group of individuals that may be identified by a University System member as trained academic integrity volunteers. These volunteers may develop academic integrity educational modules and policies and who may be available to serve on an AIRB. G. Academic Dishonesty is the term used to define the violation of the Academic Integrity Regulation. H. Violations of Academic Integrity: The behaviors described below are considered violations of the academic standards for both Undergraduate and Graduate students. The academic sanctions for Graduate students may be more severe. 1. Cheating is using or attempting to use materials, information, notes, study aids, or other assistance in any type of examination or evaluation which have not been authorized by the instructor. a. Students completing any type of examination or evaluation are prohibited from looking at or transmitting materials to another student (including electronic reproductions and transmissions) and from using external aids of any sort (e.g. books, notes, calculators, photographic images or conversation with others) unless the instructor has indicated specifically in advance that this will be allowed. b. Students may not take examinations or evaluations in the place of other persons. Students may not allow other persons to take examinations or evaluations in their places. c. Students may not acquire unauthorized information about an examination or evaluation and may not use any such information improperly acquired by others. d. Instructors, programs and departments may establish, with the approval of the colleges, additional rules for exam environments and behavior. Such rules must be announced in advance in a course syllabus or other advance written notice to students. 2. Plagiarism is intentionally or carelessly presenting the work of another as one's own. It includes submitting an assignment purporting to be the student's original work which has wholly or in part been created by another person. It also includes the presentation of the work, ideas, representations, or words of another person without customary and proper acknowledgement of sources. Students must consult with their instructors for clarification in any situation in which the need for documentation is an issue, and will have plagiarized in any situation in which their work is not properly documented. a. Every direct quotation must be identified by quotation marks or appropriate indentation and must be properly acknowledged by parenthetical citation in the text or in a footnote or endnote. b. When material from another source is paraphrased or summarized in whole or in part in one's own words, that source must be acknowledged in a footnote or endnote, or by parenthetical citation in the text. c. Information gained in reading or research that is not common professional knowledge must be acknowledged in a parenthetical citation in the text or in a footnote or endnote. d. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, the use of papers, reports, projects, and other such materials prepared by someone else. 41 3. Fabrication, Forgery and Obstruction: Fabrication is the use of invented, counterfeited, altered or forged information in assignments of any type including those activities done in conjunction with academic courses that require students to be involved in out-of-classroom experiences. Forgery is the imitating or counterfeiting of images, documents, signatures, and the like. Obstruction is any behavior that limits the academic opportunities of other students by improperly impeding their work or their access to educational resources. a. Fabricated or forged information may not be used in any laboratory experiment, report of research, or academic exercise. Invention for artistic purposes is legitimate under circumstances explicitly authorized by an instructor. b. Students may not furnish to instructors fabricated or forged explanations of absences or of other aspects of their performance and behavior. c. Students may not furnish, or attempt to furnish, fabricated, forged or misleading information to university officials on university records, or on records of agencies in which students are fulfilling academic assignments. d. Students may not steal, change, or destroy another student's work. Students may not impede the work of others by the theft, defacement, mutilation or obstruction of resources so as to deprive others of their use. e. Obstruction does not include the content of statements or arguments that are germane to a class or other educational activity. 4. Multiple Submissions is the presenting or turning in the same or substantially the same work for credit in two or more courses. Multiple submissions shall include the use of any prior academic effort previously submitted for academic credit at this or a different institution. Multiple submissions shall not include those situations where the prior written approval by the instructor in the current course is given to the student to use a prior academic work or endeavor. a. Students may not normally submit any academic assignment, work, or endeavor in more than one course for academic credit of any sort. This will apply to submissions of the same or substantially the same work in the same semester or in different semesters. b. Students may not normally submit the same or substantially the same work in two different classes for academic credit even if the work is being graded on different bases in the separate courses (e.g. graded for research effort and content versus grammar and spelling). c. Students may resubmit a prior academic endeavor if there is substantial new work, research, or other appropriate additional effort. The student shall disclose the use of the prior work to the instructor and receive the instructor's permission to use it PRIOR to the submission of the current endeavor. d. Students may submit the same or substantially the same work in two or more courses with the prior written permission of all faculty involved. Instructors will specify the expected academic effort applicable to their courses and the overall endeavor shall reflect the same or additional academic effort as if separate assignments were submitted in each course. Failure by the student to obtain the written permission of each instructor shall be considered a multiple submission. 5. Complicity is assisting or attempting to assist another person in any act of academic dishonesty. A student will be considered to be complicit if the student is aware of an academic integrity violation, is able to report and fails to do so. In addition: a. Students may not allow other students to copy from their papers during any type of examination. b. Students may not assist other students in acts of academic dishonesty by providing material of any kind that one may have reason to believe will be misrepresented to an instructor or other university official. 42 c. Students may not provide substantive information about test questions or the material to be tested before a scheduled examination unless they have been specifically authorized to do so by the course instructor. This does not apply to examinations that have been administered and returned to students in previous semesters. d. Students may not have a substitute take an examination or take an examination for someone else. 6. Improper use of teamwork credit is allowing your name to be included on a group project in which you did not participate. This act is considered a violation of academic integrity. For reference, general guidelines for appropriate teamwork participation include, but are not limited to the following: a. No team member shall intentionally restrict or inhibit another team member's access to team meetings, team work-in-progress, or other team activities without the express authorization of the instructor. b. All team members shall be held responsible for the content of all teamwork submitted for evaluation as if each team member had individually submitted the entire work product of their team as their own work. c. Only those persons who participated on the team shall be named in the submission of the assignment. 7. Solicitation or Purchase is the offering, advertising or responding to solicitations or purchasing products or services designed to facilitate, support or actively contribute to the commission of an act of academic dishonesty. 8. Misrepresentation. Submitting the work of another as your own, e.g., using a ghostwriter to write a paper, thesis, dissertation, having another person complete an on-line class in your name. 9. Misconduct in Research and Creative Endeavors is a serious deviation from the accepted academic and professional practices within a discipline or from the policies of the university in carrying out, reporting, or exhibiting the results of research or in publishing, exhibiting, or performing creative endeavors. Research Misconduct means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results. It does not include honest error or differences in opinion. In addition to the academic sanctions in this Regulation misconduct in research is also subject to USF System Policy 0-301, procedures and any sanctions contained therein. a. Students may not invent or counterfeit information. b. Students may not report results dishonestly, whether by altering data, by improperly revising data, by selective reporting or analysis of data, or by being grossly negligent in the collecting or analysis of data. c. Students may not represent another person's ideas, writing or data as their own. d. Students may not appropriate or release the ideas or data of others when such data have been shared in the expectation of confidentiality. e. Students may not publish, exhibit, or perform work in circumstances that will mislead others. They may not misrepresent the nature of the material or its originality, and they may not add or delete the names of authors without permission. f. Students must adhere to all federal, state, municipal, and university regulations or policies for the protection of human and other animal subjects. g. Students may not conceal or otherwise fail to report any misconduct involving research, professional conduct, or artistic performance of which they have knowledge. h. Students must abide by the university's policies on Misconduct in Research where applicable, which can be found in the university's policies and Procedures Manual at the Regulations and Policies website. 10. Computer Misuse includes unethical or illegal use of the computers of any person, institution or agency in which students are performing part of their academic program. a. Students may not use the university computer system in support of any act of plagiarism. b. Students may not monitor or tamper with another person's electronic communications. 43 11. Misuse of Intellectual Property is the illegal use of copyright materials, trademarks, trade secrets or intellectual properties. 12. Violation of State or Federal laws with regard to Intellectual Property is conduct that violates and does not adhere to state or federal laws concerning the fair use of copies or other intellectual property. V. SEVERITY OF CONDUCT DETERMINATIONS & ACADEMIC SANCTIONS A. General Guidelines: 1. Violations for USF System Undergraduate students are classified into four (4) levels according to the nature of the infraction. For each level of violation a corresponding set of academic sanctions is recommended, however, specific academic programs may include additional and different academic sanctions. These academic sanctions are intended as general guidelines for the academic community with examples cited below for each level of violation. These examples are not to be considered all-inclusive. 2. Violations for USF System Graduate Students are not classified into levels as the instructor determines the severity of the violation, the grade and recommends any more severe academic sanction. 3. Multiple Violations: a. Graduate Studies: Graduate Students who are assigned an \"FF\" grade will be academically dismissed from the university and will not be eligible to apply to any Graduate program at USF. Graduate Studies may have additional guidelines and protocols available online or in the Graduate Studies catalog. b. Undergraduate Studies: i. For the first \"FF\" recorded in an Undergraduate student's academic record, the student will receive a letter from the Dean of Undergraduate Studies or the Chief Academic Officer informing him or her of being placed on \"Academic Dishonesty Warning\" for the remainder of enrollment at USF and of appeal rights for the \"FF\" grade. The student may also be suspended for one (1) full semester, depending upon the level of violation. ii. For the second \"FF\" recorded, the Undergraduate Student will be suspended for one (1) full semester and readmitted only after writing a clear statement indicating remorse, understanding of the seriousness of the offense, and understanding of the importance of integrity in all areas, including academic work. A letter informing him or her of this action and appeal rights will be sent from the Dean of Undergraduate Studies. iii. The Undergraduate Student may be permanently dismissed from the university for violations of academic integrity with notice of that dismissal as a part of the formal record and transcript. iv. The maximum penalty for receipt of any \"FF\" grade may be permanent dismissal from the university for violations of academic integrity and with a notice of that dismissal as a part of the student's formal record and transcript. v. In the event of multiple violations, sanctions may be imposed consecutively or concurrently at the discretion of the AO. B. Severity of Academic Integrity for Undergraduate Students: For Undergraduate Students the severity of conduct is divided into levels with specific academic related sanctions. For Graduate Studies, the instructor determines severity and academic sanctions as provided in Section V(D) below 1. Level One a) CONDUCT: Level One violations may occur because of inexperience or lack of knowledge of principles of academic integrity on the part of persons committing the violation. These violations address incidents when intent is questionable and are 44 likely to involve a small fraction of the total coursework, are not extensive, and/or occur on a minor assignment. The following are examples: i. Working with another student on a laboratory or other homework assignment when such work is prohibited (This level is appropriate if the instructor determines it is a minor infraction). ii. Failure to footnote or give proper acknowledgment in an extremely limited section of an assignment. b) ACADEMIC SANCTIONS: i. Reduction or no credit given for the original assignment. ii. An assigned paper or research project on a relevant topic. iii. A make-up assignment at a more difficult level than the original assignment. iv. Required attendance and tuition cost for a non-credit workshop or seminar on ethics or related subjects. 2. Level Two a) CONDUCT: Level Two violations are characterized by dishonesty of a more serious character or that which affects a more significant aspect or portion of the coursework or assignment. The following are examples: i. Working with another student on a laboratory or other homework assignment when such work is prohibited (This level is appropriate if the instructor determines it is a more serious infraction). ii. Quoting directly or paraphrasing, to a moderate extent, without acknowledging the source. iii. Submitting the same work or major portions thereof to satisfy the requirements of more than one course without permission from the instructor. iv. Using data or interpretative material for a laboratory report without acknowledging the sources or the collaborators. All contributors to preparation of data and/or to writing the report must be named. v. Receiving assistance from others, such as research, statistical, computer programming, or field data collection help that constitutes an essential element in the undertaking without acknowledging such assistance in a paper, examination or project. b) ACADEMIC SANCTIONS: i. Failing grade for the assignment involved with the grade in the course determined in the normal manner. ii. Failing grade for the course, which may be an \"F\" or \"FF\" on the internal transcript. 3. Level Three* a) CONDUCT: Level Three is characterized by violations that affect a major or essential portion of work done to meet course requirements, involves premeditation or demonstrates repetition or both, of one or more violations of Level One or Level Two violations including repeating any one or more of the following actions: i. Copying on examinations. ii. Plagiarizing major or essential portions of a written assignment. iii. Acting to facilitate copying during an exam. iv. Using prohibited materials, e.g. books, notes, e-flashcards or calculators during an examination. v. Collaborating before an exam to develop methods of exchanging information and implementation thereof. vi. Altering examinations for the purposes of re-grading. vii. Acquiring or distributing an examination from unauthorized sources prior to the examination. 45 viii. Presenting the work of another as one's own. ix. Using purchased term paper or other materials (even if the source is cited). x. Removing posted or reserved material, or preventing other students from having access to it. xi. Fabricating data by inventing or deliberately altering material (this includes citing \"sources\" that are not, in fact, sources). xii. Using unethical or improper means of acquiring data. b) ACADEMIC SANCTIONS*: i. Failing grade for the course with a designation of \"FF\" on student's internal transcript. ii. Possible suspension from the university for one (1) semester. 4. Level Four* a) CONDUCT: i. All academic infractions committed after return from suspension for a previous academic honesty violation. ii. Infractions of academic honesty in ways similar to criminal activity (such as forging a grade form, stealing an examination from a professor or from a university office; buying an examination; or falsifying a transcript to secure entry into the university or change the record of work done at the university). iii. Having a substitute take an examination or taking an examination for someone else. iv. Fabrication of evidence, falsification of data, quoting directly or paraphrasing without acknowledging the source, and/or presenting the ideas of another as one's own in a senior thesis. v. Sabotaging another student's work through actions designed to prevent the student from successfully completing an assignment. vi. Willful violation of a canon of the ethical code of the profession for which a student is preparing. b) ACADEMIC SANCTIONS*: The typical sanction for all Level Four violations is permanent academic dismissal from the university with the designation of \"Dismissed for Academic Dishonesty\" to be placed permanently on a student's external transcript. C. Centralized Reporting: 1.* In all Level 3 or Level 4 violations, the instructor must send a concise written statement including details of the date, time, and incident particulars (the \"Report\") to the AO to consider additional academic sanctions above the grade assignment. 2. In Level 2, 3 and 4 violations, the instructor should contact the Dean of Undergraduate Studies or the Chief Academic Officer at their institution to determine if there is an office designated to track academic integrity violations/violators (Referred to as an \"AIO\"). If the institution has an AIO, the instructor must send a copy of the Report to the institution's AIO. The AIO will have exclusive access to the Reports and will only share the Reports to instructors or academic advisors in the event of multiple Reports regarding a single student. This will enable appropriate handling of multiple violations. 3. As member institutions may not have a Dean of Undergraduate Studies they may establish internal protocols for centralized reporting by an internal procedure or Policy. D. Severity of Academic Integrity for Graduate Students 1. The Office of Graduate Studies has no levels of severity as any violation may result in immediate dismissal. Students will be held to the standards provided for Graduate Studies if those students are admitted to a Graduate degree program or Graduate certificate or any student taking Graduate level courses. The instructor will determine the severity of the offense and the appropriate grade. Any student in a Graduate Studies course who receives an \"FF\" grade is subject to immediate dismissal and or expulsion. The grade assignments and additional academic sanctions will depend on the seriousness of the offense and may range from the receipt of: 46 a. An \"F\" or \"Zero\" grade on the subject paper, lab report, etc. b. An \"F\" in the course or activity in which credit may be earned. c. An \"FF\" in the course (leading to expulsion from the university). d. Academic Dismissal for any violations of academic dishonesty Regulations or Policies. e. Possible revocation of the degree or Graduate Certificate following a thorough investigation. E. \"FF\" Grade Guidelines: 1. Instructors may assign an \"FF\" grade in specific circumstances. An \"FF\" grade is noted on the students USF record, indicates academic dishonesty and is only reflected on internal records. Any Undergraduate Student who receives an \"FF\" grade in a course is restricted from repeating the course using the Grade Forgiveness Policy. For Graduate Students, an \"FF\" grade will lead to permanent dismissal from the university (in cases of permanent dismissal from the university a notation may be added to the official USF transcript). 2. If a student who has been accused of academic dishonesty drops the course, the student's registration in the course will be reinstated until the issue is resolved. 3. Any final course grade may be changed to an \"FF\", \"F\", or other grade depending on the instructor's decision or the ultimate resolution of the Academic Integrity Review Process. This includes any determination of a violation of the Academic Integrity Regulation that is not detected until after the student has dropped or completed the course or during or after the Academic Integrity Review Process. The actual steps for imposing the \"FF\" grade (which is an internal USF System designation) shall be established by each institution's Registrar or Chief Academic Officer. VI. PROCESS STEPS: 1. The instructor identifies or learns of an academic integrity violation. 2. The instructor identifies the severity level of the violation (see Section V(B)). 3. The instructor determines the appropriate grade assignment and use of the guidelines (included in Section V) and identifies any additional academic sanctions that may be recommended to the AO. 4. The instructor advises the student of the grade determination and recommended academic sanctions (if applicable) either in person or by email including a set date to discuss the determination (within ten (10) days of determination of the grade if possible). 5. Final Notice of Academic Sanction by the Instructor: Within ten (10) days of meeting with the student, if the instructor determines there is a grade sanction only and no recommended additional academic sanctions, the instructor may immediately assign the grade sanction and email the student notice of this final grade sanction. If the instructor does recommend additional academic sanctions, the instructor will assign the grade sanction and advise the student and AO of those recommended additional academic sanctions considered to be appropriate to the violation (Level 3 or 4 violations will include additional academic sanctions) and the process continues as detailed below. 6. Final Notice of Academic Sanction by the AO: a. Undergraduate Students: Within ten (10) days of receipt of the recommendation from the instructor, the AO will determine any additional academic sanctions, if applicable, and notify the student by email. The student may grieve the final notice by the Department level AO and ask that it be reviewed by the College Dean, who will determine if the student's grievance is appealable. The Dean will determine the final decision for reviews involving an assignment with alleged academic dishonesty. Appeals for final grades and sanctions will be considered by the Dean and may be appealable to an AIRB (as described in Section VII: Academic Integrity Appeal). b. Graduate Students: Graduate Studies uses an internal document which processes the request for academic sanctions up to and including dismissal and the Dean of Graduate Studies provides notice to the student. 47 7. Reports to a designated centralized office: The instructor or the AO may make a referral to an internal university office responsible for tracking academic integrity violations/violators if one has been designated as detailed in Section V (C). 8. If a student files an appeal (Section VII below), the final notice will not be imposed or noted until after the appeal process is complete unless the Academic Officer feels immediate action is necessary. 9. Referral to OSRR & DRIC: The Academic Offices are responsible for the AIRP and assignment of academic sanctions. If the instructor or AO determines the conduct also rises to a violation of the Student Conduct Code or the expectations and standards of the Division of Research, Integrity and Compliance (DRIC), the instructor or AO may make a referral to those offices. The instructor or AO making the referral should notify those additional offices of any pending or final academic sanction. A determination by OSRR or DRIC is separate and distinct from the AIRP and any academic sanction. The student must comply will all sanctions imposed by each office (a lesser sanction or different determination by the conduct offices does not impact the Academic sanction). 10. Transcript/Record: An Academic Integrity dismissal from the University will be reflected on a student's official transcript. A grade sanction (such as an \"FF\") or other lower sanction is reflected on the student's internal USF record. VII. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY APPEAL: If the student identifies that the determination of the academic integrity violation or related grade assignment or sanction either (1) had no factual basis or could not be reasonably inferred by the facts as presented or (2) violated a University Regulation or Policy, the student must allege the absence of factual support or basis or the specific Regulation or Policy violated and provide it as part of an academic integrity appeal. A student who has accepted responsibility for the academic integrity violation itself (either in writing or verbally) to the instructor or administrator, may not challenge the factual basis and may only appeal the severity of the sanction imposed (See Section V(B)). The student may appeal after notice of the final academic sanction(s) which is either: (1) the instructor's grade determination; or (2) if there are additional academic sanctions, after those additional academic sanctions are reviewed and determined by the Dean. The student may remain enrolled in their academic program until the conclusion of the appeal process unless the Dean determines that the student may not remain enrolled and advises the student in writing accordingly. Unless an Institution or College has established and referenced an alternative academic integrity or professional standards process, the appeal process steps for academic integrity issues are: 1. Student Written Appeal: After notice of the academic sanction, the student may send a written appeal to the Dean copying the instructor by email within ten (10) days of the grade determination or final academic sanction (additional time may be granted at the discretion of the Dean as necessary). If it is unclear who the designated Dean should be, the student may ask the instructor to identify the appropriate Dean. The student's written appeal may be an email request and must contain a concise statement of the student's position including the factual deficiency or the specific Regulation or Policy violated. This statement should include why the student feels the determination by the instructor and/or AO was not correct and must include all documentation available that supports the student's position. 2. Initial Review of Appeal: As general complaints or disagreements with the instructors decision are not grounds for appeal and students who have accepted responsibility at any time in the process may only appeal imposed sanctions, the Dean may make an initial review of the appeal to identify the limits of the appeal and to verify that the student has clearly identified that there was no factual basis for the instructor's determination and/or the specific Regulation or Policy violated. If the Dean elects to make this initial review, the Dean may clarify the parameters of the appeal (sanctions only), or dismiss the appeal as insufficient. The Dean must send the student and instructor 48 notice of this determination within ten (10) days of receiving the student's written appeal, copying the instructor's supervisor or department chair. This will be a final University decision. 3. Dean Appointment of Board: If the Dean does not dismiss the appeal, the Dean may move the appeal forward with or without the initial review or after the review set parameters for the appeal (if it is for sanctions only). The Dean will appoint an Academic Integrity Review Board (AIRB) composed of students and instructors or administrators at the Dean's discretion, provided that there are at least three (3) individuals, one (1) of which is an instructor or administrator and one (1) student. 4. Selection of AIRB members: Although the Dean may select any students to serve on the AIRB, if the university system member establishes a Student Academic Integrity Committee (SAIC) at that institution, and there are SAIC members available to serve, the Dean shall select the student board members from the SAIC to serve on the AIRB at that institution. The students serving on the AIRB do not need to be from the College in which the appeal was filed. However, when possible undergraduate students should serve on AIRB for undergraduate student appeals, graduate students for graduate student appeals, clinical students for clinical student appeals, and medical students for medical student appeals. 5. Meeting of the AIRB: Unless extended by written notice of the Dean or other extenuating circumstance, the AIRB will meet within three (3) weeks from the time the Dean receives the student's written appeal. The Dean will advise the student by email of the date, time and place of the AIRB review. If the student or instructor has a justifiable conflict, the student or instructor may make one (1) written request to reschedule the review emailed to the Dean with the reason for the request, noting any known foreseeable conflicts into the next three (3) weeks. The one-time extension may be granted at the discretion of the Dean. (The timelines provided in this Regulation may be extended at the Dean's discretion with written notice to the student and instructor). 6. AIRB Review Steps and Further Appeals: a. At the Review, the student and instructor will each be afforded an opportunity to present their position with reasonable time limits not to exceed fifteen (15) minutes per person. b. The student may bring one (1) person to serve as an advisor; however that person may not act as a legal representative, argue, present, or participate in any active way in the review, including through communications by verbal, written or electronic promptings with the student. c. Each party may be present during the other's position statement. Neither party may ask questions of the other, argue, or respond to the other's statement. The AIRB may question both parties at any time during the proceedings d. The AIRB will deliberate in private and render a decision within three (3) weeks of the AIRB review and offer its determination as a recommendation to the Dean (or equivalent depending on the organizational structure of the USF institution) with copy to the student by email. The student and instructor's concise written statements will be included with the AIRB's recommendation. The Dean will have three (3) weeks to accept or not accept the determination of the AIRB. (a) If the Dean accepts the determination of the AIRB, that is a final university decision and there is no further review available at the university. (b) If the Dean does not accept the determination of the AIRB, the Dean must refer the matter to the university level (Deans of UGS/OGS for Undergraduate and Graduate reviews, respectively or the Chief Academic Officer (See Section IV(C)). The University Level officer (a) will have three (3) weeks to make a final determination (b) may request to review any additional information necessary or may limit the review to the initial statements provided by the student and instructor upon initiation of the Academic Integrity Appeal Review and the Dean's Statement (c) will issue a determination in writing by email to the student, instructor and the Dean. This will be a final university decision. 7. In the event the determination and final university decision is an \"FF\" grade with Academic Dishonesty noted and/or a related dismissal from the College or University, the student may appeal that final university decision within thirty (30) days to the Circuit Court by way of Writ of Certiorari. 49 Authority: Art. IX, Sec. 7, Fla. Const.; FL Board of Governors Regulation 1.001(4)(a); s.1006.60(4)FS. History - New (BOT approval) 12-11-08. Amended 12-4-14, 1-7-15 (technical), 2-18-15 (technical), 6- 3-15 (technical). 50 Academic Load The maximum load per semester of an undergraduate student is eighteen (18) hours (fall & spring semesters) and fourteen (14) hours (summer semester) unless approval is received from the student's college dean. In the fall or spring semester, twelve (12) hours is the minimum load for a student to be considered as full-time. Full-time Undergraduate Student Definition - Summer Term Sessions \"A\" & \"B\" (6 weeks) For Academic purposes - six (6) hours or more each session For Financial Aid purposes - must be enrolled for twelve (12) hours (undergraduate) in any combination of sessions \"A,\" \"B\" and \"C\" Session \"C\" (10 weeks) For Academic purposes - nine (9) hours or more For Financial Aid purposes - must be enrolled for twelve (12) hours (undergraduate) in any combination of sessions \"A,\" \"B\" and \"C\" Students receiving Veterans' Administration benefits should confirm their Summer Term enrollment with the Office of Veteran Services. Undergraduates may not enroll in 6000-level courses or higher without approval of the college dean in which the course is offered. Attendance Students are expected to attend classes. An academic program or individual instructor may require a specified level of attendance as a condition for successfully completing a course. Likewise, instructors may assign a portion of final course grades based on attendance and participation. Faculty members must inform students of attendance requirements on syllabi. Instructors should accommodate excused absences by making arrangements with students ahead of time (when possible) or by providing a reasonable amount of time to make up missed work. Arranging to make up missed work is the responsibility of the student. For graded work that requires participation in discussions, group activities, and some labs, or other in class activities, instructors will attempt to provide reasonable alternatives that accomplish the same learning outcomes. Nevertheless, an instructor may determine that missing a certain amount of participation-dependent activities (whether excused or not) precludes successful accomplishment of learning outcomes. In cases like this, instructors, academic advisors, or academic deans may advise students to withdraw from such courses. In cases where excused absences are anticipated in advance, advice on successful accomplishment of learning outcomes can be given at (or before) the start of a term. There are two categories of excused absences for which accommodations will be made: scheduled and unscheduled. Scheduled absences involve time conflicts that are known in advance, for which students have notified their instructors. Acceptable reasons for scheduled absences include observation of religious holy days, court-imposed legal obligations (e.g., jury duty and subpoenas), special requirements of other courses and university sponsored events (e.g., performances, athletic events, judging trips), and requirements of military service. Employment schedules, athletic training and practice schedules, and personal appointments are not valid 51 reasons for scheduled absences. Unscheduled absences involve unforeseen emergencies such as illness, injury, hospitalization, deaths in the immediate family, consequences of severe weather, and other crises. Students should contact instructors as soon as possible in these cases. Instructors may require documentation or verification to excuse unscheduled absences. Care will be given to schedule required classes and examinations in view of customarily observed religious holy days. No student shall be compelled to attend class or sit for an examination at a day or time prohibited by his or her religious belief. Any student who believes he or she has been treated unfairly with regard to the above may seek review of a complaint through established Student Academic Governance Procedures (found in the Graduate and Undergraduate catalogs and those provided by the University's Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity.) Attendance for the Observance of Religious Days by Students USF System Policy 10-045 Attendance for the Observance of Religious Days by Students I. PURPOSE & INTENT Pursuant to Section 1006.53 Florida Statutes and Board of Governors Regulation 6.0115, the University of South Florida System (USF System) establishes the following Policy regarding religious observances. II. STATEMENT OF POLICY All students, faculty, and staff within the USF System have a right to expect reasonable accommodation of their religious observances, practices and beliefs. The USF System will, at the beginning of each academic term, provide written notice of the class schedule and formal examination periods. The USF System, through its faculty, will make every attempt to schedule required classes and examinations in view of customarily observed religious holidays of those religious groups or communities comprising the USF System's constituency. Students are expected to attend classes and take examinations as determined by the USF System. No student shall be compelled to attend class or sit for an examination at a day or time prohibited by his or her religious belief. However, students should review the course requirements and meeting days and times to avoid foreseeable conflicts, as excessive absences in a given term may prevent a student from completing the academic requirements of a specific course. Students are expected to notify their instructors at the beginning of each academic term if they intend to be absent for a class or announced examination, in accordance with this Policy. Students absent for religious reasons, as noticed to the instructor at the beginning of each academic term, will be given reasonable opportunities to make up any work missed. In the event that a student is absent for religious reasons on a day when the instructor collects work for purposes of grading (homework, pop quiz, etc.), the student shall be given a reasonable opportunity to make up such work or shall not have that work averaged into the student's grade at the discretion of the instructor. Any student who believes that he or she has been treated unfairly with regard to the above may seek review of a complaint through established USF System Academic Grievance Procedures (found in the Graduate and Undergraduate Catalogs) and those provided by the University's Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity. 52 Documented Medical Attention for Illness Students are excused for absences due to documented illnesses that require medical attention. While students should not attend class with infectious conditions, even if medical attention is not sought, the decision to excuse absences from undocumented illnesses is at the discretion of the individual instructor. Consideration should also be given to students whose dependent children experience serious illness. Extended illnesses may interfere with the successful completion of courses, and in such cases a student should contact their academic advisor by the deadline to withdraw from a course. After the withdrawal deadline, students may submit an Academic Regulations Committee (ARC) petition with proper documentation to request to withdraw for medical reasons. Students may find additional information through the FTIC and Persistence Advisor. Excused Absences and Make-up Work Students must notify their instructors at the beginning of each academic term if they intend to be absent from a class or announced examination for the approved reason as noted above in accordance with this policy. In the event that a student is absent for one of these noted reasons on a day when the instructor collects work for purposes of grading (homework, quiz, etc.), the student shall be given a reasonable opportunity to make up such work or shall not have that work averaged into the student's grade, at the discretion of the instructor. If excused for an absence, the student is responsible for completing all academic work, examinations, assignments, and labs within a period of time and in a manner deemed appropriate by the instructor. The manner for accommodating excused absences appropriately is in the hands of the instructor, but a student who is absent for an excused reason should not be at a disadvantage when compared to other students. The approved reasons for excused absences apply even if a student in a course has the option of dropping an assignment grade (e.g., dropping the lowest quiz score). Excused absences for other reasons may be allowed or declined entirely at the discretion of the instructor. Even if individual absences are excused, excessive absences may threaten a student's satisfactory completion of a course. Absences may count from the first class meeting, including for students who hope to add the class after the first day. Jury Duty The University respects the need for all citizens to serve on a jury when called to duty. If a student serves as a juror, class absences will be considered excused when the student provides advance notice to the instructor, the instructor acknowledges the request, and the student provides written verification of jury selection and proof of service. Any potential student juror may notify the court of conflicts or undue hardship and request an excuse from service. The individual student must make the decision as to whether jury service will present an undue hardship and then take the affirmative action to request to be excused from service, and may need to provide a written explanation to the court. If a student does not request to be excused and is selected to serve, the student may miss a prolonged period of time resulting in the inability to complete the academic requirements of their classes. 53 Registration Changes USF System Policy 10-006 Registration Changes Including Course Change, Cancellations, Withdrawals, and Auditing I. INTRODUCTION (Purpose and Intent) Students are fundamentally responsible for their registration status. Students may make changes to their registration status and must be aware of the academic and financial impact of those changes as provided in this University of South Florida System (USF System) Policy and other related Policies and Regulations. II. STATEMENT OF POLICY There are several ways that students, instructors (includes primary instructor or faculty member) or the University may adjust student course schedules. The options available are determined by time elapsed in the semester, university deadlines, and a student's academic status at the time of the requested adjustment. A. Drops or Adds during the DROP/ADD PERIOD: The Drop/Add Period shall begin on the first day of classes and end on the date specified in the Home Institution catalog*, but not later than the end of the first week of classes in the term. During the drop/add period, registered students may add to, delete from, or otherwise adjust their schedule of courses. Additionally, students may be deleted from class rolls based on instructor notification of non-attendance at the first class meeting. (*The Registrar at the appropriate institution may establish specific drop/add periods consistent with Financial Aid criteria for courses and programs that follow an Alternative Calendar or are developed for a specific identified purpose outside of the regular calendar.) 1. Add Students may add courses through the regular drop/add period. Students wishing to add courses past the drop/add period must petition through their Academic Regulations Committee (ARC) representative in the appropriate college or by Graduate Studies Petition. General Guidelines for Add Exceptions: Add transactions may occur on an exceptional basis and after the end of the drop/add period when the student: 1. Initiates the formal request to be approved at the discretion of the instructor, college, and department, following the procedures of the ARC or Graduate Studies petition; 2. Demonstrates the exception is justified by extraordinary circumstances including, but not limited to, administrative error; and 3. Receives approval by the ARC Representative or by Graduate Studies petition. 2. Drop a. First Class Day i. Student Voluntary Cancellation Before First Class Day Prior to the first day of classes, students may cancel their registration by dropping all of their courses via OASIS by the end of the drop/add period. Failure to initiate the drop may result in fee/grade liability. ii. Instructor Initiated Cancellation Due to Student's Failure to Attend All instructors teaching undergraduate and graduate courses are required to take attendance on the first day of class and to drop students who do not attend the first day of class. Students who experience extenuating circumstances that are beyond their control and who are unable to attend a first class meeting must notify the 54 instructor via email using the course management system (i.e. Canvas) for that course prior to the first class meeting to request waiver of the first class attendance requirement. Although instructors are authorized to affect the drop, students are fundamentally responsible for knowing their registration status, and the student must ensure that his/her registration status reflects the drop by the end of the drop/add period. For Saturday only courses or courses that begin on a Saturday, students are expected to contact the Registrar's Office on their respective USF campus to drop the course(s) no later than 5:00 pm on the following Monday. USF's distance learning students must log-in to their course(s) during the first five (5) weekdays from the calendar start date of their online course(s). Students who are unable to log-in to their course(s) due to circumstances beyond their control must notify the instructor or the department prior to the calendar start date of the course to request waiver of the first class attendance requirement. Instructors who have failed to drop a student for non-attendance during the first week of classes should initiate the course deletion after the drop/add period, as soon as the instructor discovers that the student has not attended the first class meeting and never attended any subsequent class meetings. When dropped for non-attendance, the student may be removed from the class roll and will not earn any grade nor credits for the course. b. Student Initiated Drop: Students may drop courses through the regular drop/add period (as provided in each USF System Institution's Catalog, usually within the first five days of each term). If the course is dropped within the drop/add period, no entry of these courses will appear on any permanent academic records, and all refundable tuition and fees will be returned. General Guidelines for Drop Exceptions: Drop transactions may occur on an exceptional basis and after the end of the drop/add period when the student: 1. Initiates the formal request within the University's required deadline; 2. Demonstrates the exception is justified by extraordinary circumstances including, but not limited to, administrative error; and 3. Receives approval by the ARC Committee or via Graduate Studies petition. 3. Withdrawal a. First Ten Weeks: Students may withdraw from the USF System or from individual courses without academic penalty for the first ten weeks of any term, except for summer sessions; however students will remain fee liable. b. After the Tenth Week: Students will not be permitted to withdraw from a course to avoid fee or academic penalty after the tenth week; however, appeals for withdrawal after the tenth week of the semester may be made to the Academic Regulations Committee (ARC) representative in the appropriate college or by Graduate Studies Petition within the system time (See the USF Fee Adjustment Form). c. To withdraw, undergraduate students must submit a completed ARC petition form to the college representative of the student's declared major (see the ARC form). Graduate students must submit a completed Graduate Petition form to their graduate program Advisor. No entry is made on the academic record for withdrawals submitted during the regular drop/add period. All subsequent withdrawals (through the tenth week of classes in the fall and spring semesters) are posted to the permanent academic record with \"W\" grades assigned to the courses and tuition and fee liability will be assessed. Students who withdraw may not continue attending class. d. Students who stop attending classes and do not withdraw may be assessed an \"F\" grade and the University may be required to report the circumstances related to the \"F\" including non-attendance or non-performance in the class to Financial Aid as required by law. 55 e. Withdrawal deadlines for summer sessions are listed in the Academic Calendar and are published in the USF Schedule of Classes for summer terms. f. Undergraduate students who totally withdraw while on the second term of academic probation will be academically dismissed from the USF System. When a student is academically dismissed, approval of the Academic Regulations Committee is required for reentry. 4. Auditing Privilege Students who wish to sit in on a class to review the course material may request approval to do so; however, the student will not be permitted to take exams nor receive grades or credit. The student's status for that class is an audit with presence in the classroom limited to listener. A student must register to audit courses by the end of the drop/add period. Fees for audit are the same as for full enrollment for credit, except out of state tuition is not charged. The separately accredited Regional Intuitions of the USF System have unique characteristics. Students, instructors, and staff must check with their home institutions and apply System-wide policies in conjunction and consistent with the specific characteristics and guidelines applicable to those Regional Institutions. 5. Tuition and Fee Liability a. Tuition and fees for the term shall be based on the courses remaining on the record at the close of the drop/add period. b. No tuition and fees shall be assessed, and no grades or credits shall be awarded, for course(s) dropped during the drop/add period. c. If a student adds a course or courses on an exceptional basis, tuition and fees for the added course(s) shall be assessed. University Sponsored Activities The University recognizes the importance of participation in University-sponsored activities such as musical and theatrical performances, athletic competition, and debate. It also recognizes that such participation may result in conflicts with scheduled class times. It is the responsibility of participating students to provide a full list of anticipated conflicting days to instructors by the end of the first week of the term, and directors and advisors of University activity programs have an obligation to assist students with this task. Students are responsible for identifying potential absences specific to a particular class and notifying individual instructors of these conflicts, especially for conflicts with scheduled examinations. Please note that a general schedule for a team or ensemble does not satisfy this notification requirement. Students should provide instructors with addenda (e.g., end-of-season tournaments, newly scheduled events, or rescheduled events) that result in new conflicts as soon as they are available. Directors and advisors of University activity programs should consult with participating students prior to registration to help them choose courses that do not have excessive anticipated conflicts. 56 Class Standing A student's class is determined by the number of credits he/she has earned without relation to his/her GPA. 0C Unclassified Non-degree-seeking students 1F Freshman 0 through 29 semester hours passed 2S Sophomore 30 through 59 semester hours passed 3J Junior 60 through 89 semester hours passed 4R Senior 90 or more semester hours passes; however, no baccalaureate degree earned here or elsewhere 5B Post Baccalaureate Baccalaureate degree-holder working on a second undergraduate program or degree 6M Graduate Student admitted to Master's Degree Program Course Syllabus A syllabus of instruction for each course is available at the beginning of each term. Among the items communicated are course requirements, materials, and objectives; expected learning outcomes; and a general grading scale. The syllabus is subject to revision due to various exigencies or to better facilitate instruction, and will not include unreasonable additions to the workload described in the original syllabus. The contents of the syllabus are subject to change with reasonable notice. Disruption of Academic Process SF Regulation 3.025: Disruption of Academic Process I. PURPOSE & INTENT Disruptive students in the academic setting hinder the educational process. Although disruptive student conduct is already prohibited by the University of South Florida System (USF System) Student Code of Conduct and any person may make a direct referral regarding student conduct to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities (OSRR) at any time for a conduct review and possible university wide sanction. This Academic Disruption Regulation provides the steps an Instructor may take to immediately address a student disrupting a class or academic setting including restricting a student from class, assigning an academic sanction or other immediate sanction. This is considered an Academic process and provides for academic sanctions. An Instructor may/must make additional referrals to OSSR 57 for a more comprehensive review and additional conduct sanctions which are considered separate from the Academic process. II. STATEMENT OF REGULATION This Regulation provides a mechanism for the Instructor to ensure a positive academic environment. Although academic discussion may include disagreement with the course Instructor during times when the Instructor permits discussion, it is not in itself disruptive behavior and is not prohibited; the Instructor sets the parameters for classroom interaction. Some disruptive students may have emotional or mental health disorders. Although such students may be considered disabled and are protected under the Rehabilitation Act/ADA, they are held to the same standards of conduct as any student. Misconduct occurring on premises of all institutions of the USF System which adversely affects the University community and/or the pursuit of its mission is already prohibited by the Student Code of Conduct and will be handled by those procedures. III. APPLICABILITY & AUTHORITY The following applies to all institutions of the USF System; however, non-substantive procedural modifications to reflect the particular circumstances of each separately accredited institution are permitted. Information concerning these procedures is available through the Student Affairs Office at those institutions. References to classroom or academic area include all academic settings (in class or in academic offices, live or online, field clinical experiences, fieldtrips and the communications forums established for academic use). References to Instructor include the course Instructor, USF faculty, administrators, and staff. A. Coordination of Process: 1. As each process contemplated by this Regulation includes several levels of administrative or academic review, students must direct emails or correspondence only to the single designated office identified responsible for the current level of review. Student's failure to adhere to this directive such as emailing all levels of administration, multiple parties not directly involved, or tangentially involved offices may be interpreted as a waiver of the review/appeal process and a failure to follow university directives. 2. As conduct that violates this Regulation may also violate others and may result in several referrals and/or administrative review and actions, students must be aware that several offices may be contacting them such as: a. The College/School/Department to address alleged academic disruption; b. The Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities (OSRR) to address possible violation of the Student Code of Conduct; c. The Students of Concern Assessment Team (SOCAT) to identify how to best coordinate the resources available to assist in addressing concerns. IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS A. Disruption of the academic process: Disruption of the academic process is defined as the act, words, or general conduct of a student in a classroom or other academic environment which in the reasonable estimation of the Instructor: 1. Directs attention away from the academic matters at hand, such as noisy distractions, persistent, disrespectful or abusive interruption of lecture, exam, academic discussion, or general University operations; or 58 2. Presents a danger to the health, safety or well-being of self or other persons. B. Notice: Notice will be considered final upon sending of an email to a student's official USF email address. Additional notice may be sent at the discretion of the parties. V. PROCESS STEPS: (a) Instructor Response: 1. If a student is disruptive, the Instructor may ask the student to stop the disruptive behavior and/or warn the student that such disruptive behavior can result in immediate academic and/or additional disciplinary action. Alleged disruptions of the academic process will be handled initially by the Instructor, who will discuss the incident with the student whenever possible. It must be noted that the Faculty Senate considers the traditional relationship between student and Instructor as the primary means of settling disputes that may arise. 2. The Instructor is authorized to ask a student to immediately leave the classroom or academic area and desist from the disruptive behavior if the Instructor deems it necessary.* In addition, the Instructor may extend the restriction or impose the restriction after the conclusion of the class. At the time the Instructor imposes the initial restriction or extends the restriction, the Instructors are accountable for compiling and sending the scanned Academic Disruption Incident Report (details and link to Report may be found in Section 5: Documentation and Academic Disruption Incident Report below) by email to the student's USF email address and simultaneously, within 48 hours of the restriction to: a. The department chair; b. The Assistant/Associate Academic Dean of the College (as determined by the College); c. The Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities (OSRR) or the separately accredited institution's designated office in Student Affairs; and d. The student (the Academic Disruption Incident Report should include notice to the student of whether the student is permitted back in class and the conditions of that return or the duration of the exclusion). *If the situation is deemed an emergency that requires immediate action, the Instructor should notify the appropriate law enforcement agency as soon as possible. 3. The Instructor remains responsible for the academic sanction and communication to the student with regard to the student's ability to return to class, regardless the filing of the report to other offices (which is required to enable the USF System to comprehensively respond beyond the immediate academic authority). a. If the Instructor permits the student to return after the classroom incident or is restricting the student from the classroom pending resolution, the Instructor or his/her designee must email, call or notify the student in person that: i. The student is excluded and for how long (may be indefinitely, permanently or undetermined pending review); ii. The student has the right to request an expedited review of the exclusion within two (2) days to the Chair of the Department. 4. Possible Academic Sanctions, Actions and Guidelines a. Authority of an Instructor and the appropriate Chair or Assistant/Associate Dean's Office may result in any of the following sanctions: Warning to the student Voluntary withdrawal by the student from the class(es). Temporary exclusion and/or permanent dismissal from the Instructor's classroom or academic area, program, or college, pending an expedited appeal. Academic sanction, including assignment of a final If the final determination is a dismissal from class, the grade assigned for the class will depend on the student's status at the time of dismissal. If the student had a passing grade in the class at the time of dismissal, a grade of \"W\" will be assigned for the course. If the student had a 59 failing grade in the class at the time of dismissal, a grade of \"F\" will be assigned for the course. These grades will become a part of the student's permanent record. In addition, if the academic disruption results in dismissal from more than the classroom or academic area of the incident, this grading policy may be applied in all classes affected. b. The Instructor or Academic Administrator must advise the OSRR or the separately accredited institution's designated office of the final Academic Sanction as soon as possible. 5. Documentation and Academic Disruption Incident Report a. Instructors should be aware that notes of the dates, times, witnesses and details of the incidents of disruption and the impact of the disruption on those present may be important in any future proceedings which may be necessary. The Academic Disruption Incident Report may be amended or updated at any time with additional information. The OSRR or designated office in Student Affairs requires written documentation containing factual and descriptive information. All parties are entitled to see this documentation. b. Instructors are accountable for compiling and sending the Academic Disruption Incident Report either by hardcopy or scanned, and sent by email to the student's USF email address, simultaneously, within 48 hours to: i. The department chair; ii. Dean of the College or Designee (as determined by the College); iii. The Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities or the separately accredited institution's designated office in Student Affairs; and iv. The student. The form can be downloaded from the designated websites in the Academic or Student Affairs offices and are specifically available at: http://www.sa.usf.edu/srr/docs/Acad%20Disruption%20Incident%20Report%20Form.pdf, or completed by way of memorandum containing the following information: Date of report Student's name name Title of course, course number and section Date/time/location of incident Detailed summary of the incident, including a description of the disruptive behavior Witnesses Action, if any, taken by the Instructor (e.g., student warned, asked to leave the class, ) Recommended course of action and reasons for this recommendation Instructor's signature B. Student Response (including right to review): 1. Students must respect the immediate action taken by the Instructor. However, students do have the right to ask for a review of the Instructor's decision or recommendation. 2. Each step in this review process must be initiated within and concluded by 48 hours of the last step. A designee may review instead of the administrative officer. 3. The student may appeal the academic decision in writing to the Chair of the Department. The Chair must review the written appeal and decide if the student can return to the specific class and/or any academic setting. The Chair may consult with the student or Instructor or base the decision on the report submitted. 4. The student may appeal the Chair's decision in writing to the Dean of Undergraduate Studies or Graduate Studies or the institutional officer as appropriate) for review and decision. Any decision rendered at that point must be in writing and will serve as the final and binding academic decision of the university. 60 5. Students should review Section III: Applicability & Authority as well as Section C: Additional Referrals and Sanctions below with regard to the possibility of multiple reviews and the need to respect the autonomy of each. C. Additional Referrals and Sanctions: 1. Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities Student Academic Disruptions may violate the University Student Conduct Code or possible external laws. Students will be held accountable accordingly. Upon receipt of the Academic Disruption Incident Report or other academic referral for disruptive conduct, the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities or designated office in Student Affairs may initiate the disciplinary process resulting in the imposition of any of the following sanctions in addition to any academic sanctions imposed (in section V(A)(4)): Educational sanctions to include but not limited to educational programs/classes and written assignments Disciplinary probation Provisional suspension Suspension Restriction from certain or all class(es), program, college, residence hall, or any part or all of USF System institutions. Expulsion 2. Law Enforcement Criminal Conduct will be handled by appropriate law enforcement agencies. 3. Sharing of Information The Academic Office (Dean, Director or other Academic Office) that imposes the final decision and related sanction (if applicable) will advise OSRR of any sanctions imposed by the academic area. In addition the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities or designated office in Student Affairs will advise the Instructor and appropriate academic administrators/Instructors responsible for the student's current academic standing as soon as possible, but within two weeks of the reported incident. Only final disciplinary sanctions that affect the academic status of the student will be communicated to the Instructor(s) and appropriate academic administrators after the disciplinary process is complete.

IX, Sec. 7, Harassment USF System Policy: 0-004 Sexual Misconduct/Sexual Harassment (Including Sexual Violence) The University of South Florida System (USF System) community is most successful when it is based on respect and fair treatment of all people. The USF System strives to provide a work and study environment for faculty, staff and students that is free of discrimination and sexual harassment, including sexual violence. As part of the effort to maintain an environment that is comfortable for all people, the USF System establishes this Policy. Sexual harassment, including sexual violence, is prohibited within the USF System, and complaints of such conduct are to be filed with one of two designated offices within the USF System: specifically, the Office of Diversity, Inclusion and Equal Opportunity (DIEO) or the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities (OSRR). The designated office will review such complaints and provide appropriate response including counseling, mediation (in limited circumstances), and/or referral for disciplinary action, up to and including termination from employment and/or expulsion from the USF System. Pursuant to Title IX, the University does not discriminate on the basis of sex in educational programs or activities that it operates. Such protection extends to both employees and students. Any questions or inquiries concerning to the application of Title IX may be referred to the Title IX Coordinator, the Title IX Senior Deputy Coordinator, or to any of the University's Title IX Deputy Coordinators. The most up-to-date information on the University's Title IX Coordinator and Deputy Coordinators can be found in the webpage for the Office of Diversity, Inclusion and Equal Opportunity, located at www.usf.edu/diversity.

When appropriate, the University will take steps to prevent the recurrence of harassment, including sexual violence, and to correct any discriminatory effects of harassment on the complainant and others. 63 General Student Grievance Process USF Policy 30-054: General Student Grievance Process I. INTRODUCTION The University of South Florida System (USF System or University) is committed to mutual respect among all constituents of the University community. This commitment includes students, faculty, staff, and administration alike. In all concerns about fair treatment, we seek to work together to understand and address those concerns in an informal setting. As there are several offices designated to address grievances throughout the University (see USF System Policy 30-053: Student Grievance Processes), with specific processes applicable to USF Health, students should first identify the topic or substance of a grievance and file the grievance with the appropriate office. II. APPLICABILITY Any student concern that has a specific review process outlined in USF System Policy 30-053 must be addressed using the appropriate designated process or may be redirected to the appropriate process. As there are some grievances that may fall outside of any set Policy or Regulation or a Student may not be aware of the process availability this Policy is established as a general guideline for the USF System for students to grieve general concerns related to university departments, administration and/or staff. Most specifically, student concerns related to an academic unit's assignment of grades or decision regarding the academic progression of a student enrolled in a course for academic credit must be addressed through the USF System Policy 10-002: Academic Grievance Procedure for Students. In addition, as each individual USF System Institution may have established internal grievance policies, the Institution specific policies shall be applied in place of, or as a first step to this Policy depending on the actual terms of the Institution policies. In addition, as individual USF System Institutions may have different levels of authority or titles, the applicable levels and titles will replace the terms of this Policy. III. DEFINITIONS OF TERMS 1. Informal General Student Complaint is the first step in the General Process and is a verbal or written claim by a student alleging improper, unfair, or arbitrary treatment by a USF System department administrator, and/or staff member or an attempt to seek guidance on how to find the appropriate office or person to assist in informally resolving a complaint with a department administrator or staff member. The Ombudsperson can be a confidential resource for students who want to discuss their options for resolving these complaints and the Ombudsperson may assist the student in resolving the issue informally or redirect the student to the appropriate office for review or formal. However, it is recommended that the student first attempt to address their complaint by discussing it with the person most directly involved with their complaint as set forth in the process below. 2. Formal General Student Grievance is a written claim that may be filed if the Informal General Complaint Process does not resolve the issue and the student identifies improper, unfair, or arbitrary action by a USF System department, administrator, and/or staff member involving the application of a specific provision of a USF System regulation, policy or procedure. Formal grievance or complaints must utilize the official form. 3. Time shall mean \"academic time,\" or \"academic days\" which are periods when USF System classes are in session. The person vested with authority at the appropriate level may extend any of the time periods contained herein for good cause. Any extensions must be communicated in writing to all parties. For the purposes of this Policy, each step shall be afforded three (3) weeks (21 academic days) as a standard time limit. The time line shall begin at the time of the first occurrence or at the time a student, using reasonable due diligence, should have obtained knowledge of the first occurrence of the event giving rise to the complaint. If the complaint or grievance is not presented or processed within the established limits, it shall not be considered. If a complaint or grievance is not appealed to the next step within the established time limits, it shall be considered settled (on the basis of the last answer). If, after presentation at any step, a USF System department, administrator, 64 and/or staff member does not discuss and/or answer the complaint or grievance with the student within the established time limits, the student may treat the complaint or grievance as denied at that step and may appeal the complaint or grievance to the next step. 4. Written Communication may be either e-mail or postal mail. IV. PROCESS STEPS/SPECIFIC PROVISIONS 1. Informal General Student Complaints: a. The Student must first attempt to address his/her complaint by discussing it with the person most directly involved with their complaint within the time period defined above. If the complaint is not resolved, the student may elect to elevate the complaint in writing to a Formal General Student Grievance as provided below. b. If possible, the USF System department, administrator, and/or staff member should respond by meeting with the student to attempt an agreement or resolution. c. If there is no agreement or resolution reached by a meeting, or if either party determines a meeting is not a viable alternative, the student may schedule a time to discuss the complaint with the employee's direct supervisor. The student is responsible for providing copies of all relevant documents including emails and previous determinations from the incident and any attempt at resolution. d. The direct supervisor will review previous resolution steps, discuss the complaint with the student and other appropriate individuals, and communicate a final answer to the student in writing. 2. Formal General Student Grievances: a. If the student believes that the answer or action determined by the Informal General Complaint Process has violated published policies and procedures or has been applied to the student in a manner different from other students, the student may file a formal grievance utilizing the appropriate form to the appropriate System officer as follows: 1. USF: Office of the Dean of Students (In cases involving USF Health, the Dean of Students will accept the complaint and if it moves beyond level (a) below, the Dean of Students will transfer the matter for review and final determination to USF Health. USF Health will identify the appropriate reviewing officer who will provide the final determination back to the Dean of Students for record keeping purposes only). 2. USFSP: Office of the Dean 3. USFSM: Office of the Dean b. Grievances regarding Dean or Student Affair Administrator: If the grievance is pertaining to actions of any of the three identified persons or offices listed above, the student should file their Grievance with the Vice President of Student Affairs and Student Success or the highest level of administrative officer vested with the authority over student affairs issues at the USF System Institution. c. The Dean or System Officer (herein \"Dean\") identified above will review the form and materials submitted by the student to see if the material constitutes a grievance, which must include reference to the specific policy or procedure that has been violated or applied differently to the student. If the Dean determines that the complaint does not constitute a grievance, the Dean will communicate to the student and the involved USF department, administrator, and/or staff member and the complaint and/or grievance will be considered closed. d. If the Dean* determines that the complaint and materials do constitute a grievance, the Dean shall conduct a thorough review and provide a written statement of finding to the student and the involved USF department, administrator, and/or staff member. Specific remedies will be proposed and corrective action will be recommended by the Dean. It is important to note that the Dean can only recommend corrective action and assist in communicating that action to the parties. (*In USF Health cases, this review and determination will be made by the appropriate reviewing officer with the final determination reported back to the Dean). 65 Good Standing USFSM students will be considered in Good Standing if they are currently enrolled or eligible to return to USFSM and have a 2.00 USF System GPA.

Persons born before 1957 may be considered to have had a natural infection, and therefore meet the proof of immunity requirement. The documented date of immunization for measles should indicate the day, month, and year. However, month and year will suffice if the month and year indicate that the immunization was given at least 13 months after the month of birth, OR b. Copy of laboratory (serologic) evidence of measles immunity (IgG rubeola titer), OR c. A written, dated statement signed by a physician on his/her stationery that specifies the date seen and stating that the person has had an illness characterized by a generalized rash lasting three (3) or more days, a fever of 101 Fahrenheit or greater, a cough, and conjunctivitis, and, in the physician's opinion, is diagnosed to have had the 10 day measles (rubeola). 2. RUBELLA: a. Medical documentation of immunization with live rubella virus vaccine on, or after, the first birthday. Persons born before 1957 may be considered to have had a natural infection, and therefore meet the proof of immunity 66 requirement. The documented date of immunization for rubella should indicate the day, month, and year. However, month and year will suffice if the month and year indicate that the immunization was given at least 13 months after the month of birth, OR b. Copy of laboratory (serologic) evidence of rubella immunity (IgG rubella titer). 3. HEPATITIS B: a. Medical documentation of immunization with 3 doses of Hepatitis B vaccine, OR b. Copy of laboratory (serologic) evidence of Hepatitis B immunity (anti-HBs titer). OR c. Signed declination (waiver) of the vaccine. 4. MENINGITIS: a. Medical documentation of immunization with Meningitis vaccine at age 16 or later or signed waiver of the vaccine. Declining by waiver of this vaccine is not acceptable for students in on-campus housing. OR b. Signed declination (waiver) of the vaccine. E. EXEMPTIONS WILL BE CONSIDERED AS FOLLOWS: 1. RELIGIOUS: Except for the mandatory meningitis immunization required for any student living in on-campus housing, students may request an exemption due to religious beliefs from the general immunization requirements by contacting USF Student Health Services. 2. MEDICAL: Requests for temporary or permanent medical exemptions must be submitted to USF Student Health Services by the attending physician and must include reason for exemption and duration of exemption. 3. ON-LINE COURSES: Students registered in 100% on-line courses may be exempt from the requirements of this Policy. However, if a student registers for any on-campus course at any time, the immunization requirements of this Policy will be in effect for all future courses. In the event of a disease outbreak, students exempted from immunization requirements may be requested by the University, at the direction of public health officials, to show titer Proof of Immunity, become immunized, or remain off campus for the duration of the outbreak. All requests for exemptions will be reviewed to ensure consistency in application. F. CONSEQUENCES: Students who fail to comply with the requirements as stated above will be blocked from registration, may be referred to Student Rights and Responsibilities, restricted from on-campus housing assignment, and/or may be subject to a registration hold. In specific circumstances a temporary override may be granted, however, vaccination requirements must be completed before further registration in subsequent terms will be permitted and current registration may be suspended if any deficiency in immunization status is identified. 67 Parking Services Location: 8350 USF4.0010: Parking General Guidelines, Registration, Rates and Penalties Parking regulations are designed to provide safe and orderly parking and to ensure emergency access to all buildings. Parking lots are available for use by students, faculty, staff and visitors. Permits are required to park at USFSM 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including holidays. Each person may purchase only one automobile permit (an additional permit for a motorcycle may be purchased). A limited number of adhesive permits are available for those with soft-top vehicles and/or special circumstances. USFSM permits may be transferred between same-owner vehicles only. If you terminate your association with USFSM for any reason, you must return your parking permit to the Parking Services Department located in Room B116 on the USFSM Campus. The departments's regular office hours are 8:30 am to 5:00 pm, Monday through Friday; however, office hours are extended during the first week of the academic term. Permit prices, campus maps, and a \"Guide to Parking at the USFSM Campus\" are available on the Parking Services website. Parking Citations Violations of USFSM parking regulations may result in the issuance of parking citations and immobilization or towing of the vehicle. Any vehicle bearing a lost, stolen or altered parking permit is subject to immediate immobilization and/or towing, even if the vehicle bearing the permit is owned by the person who has reported the permit as having been lost or stolen. The vehicle owner may be subject to possible revocation of campus parking privileges. Parking citations must either be paid or appealed within 14 calendar days of issuance to avoid incurring late fees. Any person who receives a parking citation and believes that extraordinary or mitigating circumstances warrant waiver of the fine may petition the Parking Services Department for reconsideration within 14 calendar days of receipt of the citation. Appeals must be in writing and may be submitted electronically via the USFSM Parking Services website or in person by visiting Parking Services. The Student Government Association (SGA) Judicial Branch facilitates student parking appeals at USFSM. Students may choose to have their appeal reviewed by the Parking Services Department or by the SGA Supreme Court. If an appeal is not filed within 14 calendar days from the date the citation was issued, the right to appeal is forfeited. Failure to respond to parking citations within 45 calendar days of receipt may result in the account being transferred to a collection agency and the incurrence of additional fees. Administrative holds may also be placed on a student's account which will prevent the student from registering for classes and receiving grades and transcripts. Reciprocity Student permits are required to be purchased for the USF System campus of primary assignment. To be eligible to purchase a USFSM student parking permit, the following conditions must be met: USF System home campus must be designated as USFSM with the Registrar's Office; Student must live within the USFSM service area (Sarasota, Manatee, DeSoto, Charlotte and Lee Counties); Student must be taking at least 50% of classes at USFSM. 68 Regular USF Tampa and USF St. Petersburg parking permits are valid at USFSM; however, Park 'n Ride or special permits from other USF System campuses are not valid on the USFSM campus. Reciprocity between USF campuses is subject to change each academic year. Parking privileges for the USF Tampa and USF St. Petersburg campuses will be posted on the USFSM Parking Services website. Visitors Parking Permits USFSM visitors may park in specially-designated \"Visitor Only\" parking spaces without a permit; however, they are required to adhere to the posted one (1) hour time limit. USFSM visitors whose university business is expected to exceed the time limitation of visitor parking may secure a free temporary permit from Parking Services, the main rotunda reception desk, or departmental office managers. A visitor is any person who is not a member of USFSM or any USF System campus. USFSM students, faculty, staff, vendors, contractors, licensees, and those registered for any course on campus do not qualify for visitor parking privileges and may be issued citations for parking in spaces designated as \"Visitor Only\" parking. Posthumous Degrees or Degrees in Memoriam USF Policy 10-047 Posthumous Degrees USFSM may award a posthumous baccalaureate or master's degree to a student who was in good academic standing at the time of his or her death and who had completed all substantive requirements for the degree. The University may also award baccalaureate or master's degrees in memoriam to a student who was in good academic standing at the time of his or her death. To award a non-thesis degree, the student would need to have completed all courses required for the degree. Courses required for the degree, in which the student is enrolled at the time of his or her death, must have been completed to the satisfaction of the faculty so that passing grades might be posted. All other degree requirements must have been satisfied as well. To award a thesis degree, all courses must be completed as described above and the thesis must be sufficiently complete to the satisfaction of the faculty so that certification of completion may be posted to the student's record. Procedures for Award of Posthumous Degrees or Degrees in Memoriam The appropriate faculty member, on his or her own initiative or upon the request of the family of the student, may recommend a posthumous degree, or a degree in memoriam, by forwarding the recommendation to the respective college dean. If approved by the dean, the recommendation with supporting documentation will be forwarded to the Regional Vice Chancellor for Academic and Student Affairs for approval. If approved for recommendation, the Office of the Registrar will be notified and the degree may be awarded at the next commencement ceremony or may also be presented to the student's families in an appropriate setting. 69 Professional and Continuing Education http://www.usfsm.edu/academics/professional-and-continuing-education/index.aspx USF Sarasota-Manatee sometimes offers selective non-credit continuing education courses/programs to help individuals and organizations achieve their professional development, job training, or personal enrichment goals. Please note that all continuing education courses are non-credit and will not transfer to another program requiring semester credits/hours. Records and South Florida Student Records Policy USF System Regulation UFS4.0101: Student Registration USF System Policy 10-006: Changing Courses, Cancellations & Withdrawals from the USF System & Auditing Privileges The Office of Records & Registration at USFSM, in cooperation with the USF System Registrar's Office, is responsible for maintaining each student's academic record from the time of admission to awarding of degree. The office provides information and services to students via OASIS, the University's Online Access Student Information System. Using their NetID, students can register for and drop/add courses, process address changes, access registration appointment and \"hold\" information, request privacy statuses, view their grades, and order transcripts. Students can also browse the class Schedule Planner. Information and services are continually being added for students. Students may receive assistance via their OASIS account, or from the USFSM Office of Records & Registration in person, via telephone, or by email. The Office of Records & Registration provides the following services: Coordinates registration and drop/add activities and processes Reviews requests for reclassification of residency Processes changes of address and USF institutions Processes graduation applications Prepares enrollment verification Processes degree certification Coordinates diplomas 70 Students interested in requesting fee adjustments, late registration fee waivers, or posting of grade forgiveness will find information and forms on the USFSM website and in the Office of Records & Registration. Students are encouraged to contact the USFSM Office of Records & Registration with general questions concerning academic policies and procedures of their current registration or academic record. The USF System Office of the Registrar maintains the official academic records for all students and course registrations for currently enrolled students. Academic Record The student's academic record shall not be changed after the student has graduated. Admitted Degree-Seeking Students Registration Continuing degree-seeking students register by appointment for their next semester's courses during the preceding term, using the OASIS system. Registered students may make course schedule adjustments from the time of their initial registration appointment time through the first week of classes. (Deadline information is available in the Academic Calendar.) Degree-seeking students who do not register prior to the posted deadline may late-register during the first week of classes, however, a $100.00 late registration fee is charged during this week. (See the section on fees for additional information and the appropriate term's Schedule of Classes for dates.) To avoid cancellation of registration, fees are due for all registered courses of record on the fifth day of classes (end of drop/add period). (See Academic Calendar for dates.) Mandatory Medical History Form is required for all students (regardless of age) According to Florida Administrative Code Rule 6C-6.001(5), \"Each student accepted for admission shall, prior to registration, submit on a form, provided by the institution, a medical history signed by the student.\" Adds After a student has completed his/her registration on the date assigned, he/she may add courses until the add deadline specified in the Academic Calendar. See the appropriate semester's University Schedule of Classes for detailed instructions and dates. 71 Administrative Holds A student may be placed on administrative hold by failure to meet obligations to the University. When a student is on administrative hold, he/she may not be allowed to register, receive a diploma, or receive a transcript. Settlement of financial accounts must be made at the University Cashier's Office. Each student placed on administrative hold should determine from OASIS which office placed him/her in this status and clear the obligation with that respective office. Auditing Privileges and Fees A student who wishes to sit in on a class to review the course material may do so; however, the student will not earn grades nor receive credit. The student's status for that class is an auditor and his/her presence in the classroom is as a listener. While auditors are considered \"listeners\" only, it is at the faculty member's discretion whether, and to what extent, an auditor may participate in the class discussion and activities. Audit status must be obtained during the first five (5) days of the term by filing an Audit Form with the Registrar's Office and obtaining permission from the college/department on the campus where the course is being offered. In-State fees are assessed for all audit courses. Cancellation of Registration Students may cancel their registration by logging-in to OASIS and dropping all their classes prior to the end of the fifth day of classes. If fees have already been paid, the student may request a full refund of fees from the Cashier's Office. Confidentiality Policy USF System Regulation USF2.0021 Student Records In the interest of openness and building trust with our students, the USF System now affords students the right to limit data usage and sharing of their information, without having to request non-disclosure of directory information under the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Pursuant to the requirements of FERPA, the following types of information designated by law as \"directory information\" can be released, if the student has not requested 72 privacy or non-disclosure: Name, Date of Birth, Address, Telephone, Major, Dates of Attendance, Enrollment Status, Degrees, and Prior Institutions Attended. *All other student data is considered to be protected. Under new USF System policy which is less restrictive than privacy under FERPA, students may now request confidentiality as a way to \"opt out\" from having their personal contact information (i.e. name, address, telephone) disclosed to vendors, credit card companies, or outside agencies that are not providing a service that would otherwise be performed by the University. To request confidentiality, go to http://www.usf.edu/registrar/resources/privacy.aspx. Degree and Non-Degree Definitions Degree-Seeking Students: Students who have been accepted into a degree program. Non-Degree-Seeking Students: Students who have not been accepted into a degree program. Non-degree-seeking students may enroll and enter classes on a space available basis by obtaining appropriate approval from the degree-granting college or academic unit in which the courses are offered. Non-degree-seeking students must meet all prerequisites for courses in which they wish to enroll. Certain classes are available only to degree-seeking students and may not be available for non-degree-seeking students. Should a student be accepted into a graduate degree program, no more than twelve (12) hours of USF system credit earned as a non-degree-seeking student may be applied to satisfy graduate degree requirements. All coursework transferred into the graduate program must have a grade of \"B\" or better. Any application of such credit must be approved by the degree-granting college and must be appropriate to the program. Prior to completing twelve (12) hours in a specific degree program, it is strongly recommended that a non-degree-seeking student apply for admission, and be accepted, to the degree program to continue taking courses in the program. Programs may have additional requirements. Students should check with the program of interest for more information. Florida Residency for Tuition Purposes Website: http://sar.usfsm.edu/admissions/residency/ This notice summarizes the provisions of Florida School Code (SB20-E) Section 1009.21 and University Policy/Procedure concerning Florida Residency for Tuition Purposes. In determining residency classification, students fall into one of two categories. They are either independent students (students not claimed on parent's or legal guardian's federal income tax statement or whose parents do not provide 50% or more of their support) or dependent students (students, regardless of age, who are claimed as dependents by parent or legal guardian on federal income tax statement or whose parents provide 50% or more of their support). The law requires that a U.S. citizen/permanent resident alien/independent student or a dependent student's parent/legal guardian has established and maintained a LEGAL Florida residence for at least twelve (12) months before the first day of classes of the term for which Florida residency status is sought. The USF System is required to obtain documentation of 12 months of 73 legal residence before a student is classified as a Florida resident for tuition purposes. A student is required to request Florida residency in writing and submit supporting documents no later than the fifth day of classes in the term for which classification is sought. The following is acceptable, non-conclusive evidence of the establishment of a legal residence in Florida. Two documents must be dated/issued at least 12 months before the first day of classes of the term for which Florida residency is sought. Required Documentation At least one (1) of the two documents must be from this list: Florida voter's registration Florida driver's license State of Florida identification card Florida vehicle registration Proof of purchase of permanent home in Florida occupied as primary residence Proof of homestead exemption in Florida Official transcripts from a Florida high school for multiple years (two (2) or more years), if the Florida high school diploma or GED was earned within the last 12 months Full-time, non-temporary employment in Florida for at least 30 hours per week for a 12-month period Claimant may be provided one (1) or more documents from the following list to be used in conjunction with one document from above. Declaration of Domicile in Florida Florida issued professional/occupational license Florida incorporation Documents supporting claimant's request for resident status, include, but not limited to, utility bills and proof of 12 consecutive months of payments, a signed residential lease agreement and proof of 12 consecutive months of payment; or an official state, federal or court documented legal ties to Florida Proof of membership in a Florida-based charitable or professional organization Rent receipts, leases, employment records, tax returns, school/college records are NOT evidence of establishing a legal Florida residence. Students who are dependent on out-of-state parents or who come to Florida for educational purposes are generally ineligible for reclassification to Florida status. In rare cases, the law allows some students (e.g., military, public school teachers, etc.) who do not meet the basic requirements to be classified as Florida residents for tuition purposes. For more information about exceptional categories, contact the Admissions or Registrar's Office. Student Information Changes Notifications regarding changes of address, name, residency, and citizenship should be filed promptly with the USFSM Office of Records & Registration. 74 Student Information Release USF System Regulation USF2.0021 Student Records Pursuant to requirements of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the following types of information, designated by law as \"directory information,\" may be released via official media of USF (according to USF regulation): Student name, major field of study, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, and full- and part-time status. The University Directory, published annually by the University, contains only the following information: student name, campus phone, campus mail stop, classification, and major field of study. The Directory and other listings of \"directory information\" are circulated in the course of University business and, therefore, are accessible to the public, as well as to students, faculty, and staff. Students must inform the USF System Office of the Registrar in writing (forms available for that purpose), if they wish directory information to be withheld. Such requests must be received within the first two (2) weeks of the semester and will remain in effect until the student has not been enrolled at USF System institution for three (3) consecutive terms. Notification to the University of refusal to permit release of \"directory information\" via the University Directory must be received no later than the end of the first week of classes in the Fall semester. Transcript Information Transcripts of a student's USF System institution academic record may be released only by authorization of the student online at oasis.usf.edu, or in person, or by writing to the Office of the Registrar. By law, requests must include the student's identification number, the date, and the student's signature. Requests can also be made through OASIS, the University of South Florida's Online Access Student Information System\u2014log in with your NetID and self-assigned password, which acts as your electronic signature. In order for transcripts to be issued, the student must have no financial obligations to the University. Transcripts are normally mailed/ready for pickup within two business days after the request is received. The transcript request form can be found at http://sar.usfsm.edu/registration/registration-forms/. To order transcripts by mail, send payment ($10.00 per copy, check or money order only) and form to the following address: Transcript Clerk, Registrar's Office USF-SVC 1034 4202 E. Fowler Avenue Tampa, FL 33620-6950 To order a transcript in person, hand-carry payment (check, money order or cash) and completed request form to the USFSM Cashier's Office located at USF Sarasota-Manatee, Room SMC-B116. Note: Transcript fees are subject to change. 75 Students can pick up a transcript from the Office of Records & Registration on the Sarasota campus, usually within 48 business hours after paying in-person at the Sarasota Cashier's Office. If you order a transcript \"for pickup\" in OASIS, you may choose from which campus you wish to pick up. Transient Students USF System Policy 10-001: Transient Students USFSM degree-seeking students who wish to enroll at another regionally accredited institution should have prior written approval from their college academic advisor to be certain that the work they complete will apply toward their degrees at USFSM. The transient student/cross enrollment form located at the website address www.floridashines.org should be used for this purpose. 76 Student Code of Conduct Student Rights & Responsibilities USF System Regulation USF6.0021 Student Code of Conduct I. PURPOSE AND INTENT/STATEMENT OF REGULATION A. The Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities (OSRR) supports the mission, goals, values and vision of the University of South Florida System (\"University\" or \"USF\") by promoting a community that values individual responsibility and the adherence to community standards as embodied in this Regulation (\"Student Code of Conduct\"). Through the conduct process, OSRR engages students in personal and social responsibility. B. OSRR's goal is to encourage and develop standards of behavior and critical thinking that will create a community of leaders and citizens' and enhance the USF environment for community members living, studying and working within the University. By engaging students in one-on-one interactions with staff trained in student development and through group interactions with the University Conduct Board, USF students are challenged to assess and reassess their framework of principles and behavioral norms that support a healthy community. C. The University supports student learning and development through outreach: faculty training on student classroom conduct and managing the classroom. This prepares our faculty and students to deal with conflicts and mutually agreed upon community standards. II. AUTHORITY A. The University values a community based on the principles of inclusivity, ethics, and civility. As such, the University community expects students to behave in a manner that supports this purpose. This Student Code of Conduct is a document which describes behavior that is counteractive to this purpose and how the University will hold students accountable for those inappropriate behaviors. Student organizations are also disciplined under this Student Code of Conduct. Failure of a student or student organization to comply with federal or state laws or University regulations and policies may subject the student or student organization to appropriate civil and criminal authorities. If the student is suspended or expelled, a record of a violation of University regulations and/or policies will be maintained in the student's or student organization's disciplinary file in the OSRR and may be maintained in the Office of the Registrar. B. University jurisdiction and discipline extends to conduct which occurs on University premises or which adversely affects the University community and/or the pursuit of its mission. Specifically, University officials may initiate disciplinary charges for conduct off campus when the behavior relates to the good name of the University; the integrity of the educational process; or the safety and welfare of the University community, either in its public personality or in respect to individuals within it; or violates state or federal law. C. Students are responsible for compliance with all public laws as well as University rules, policies and regulations. Students are responsible for their guests' compliance as well. D. Students are responsible for knowing the information, policies, and procedures outlined in this Student Code of Conduct. The University reserves the right to make changes to the Code as necessary. Students are encouraged to check online at generalcounsel.usf.edu for the most updated versions of all policies and regulations. E. The University strongly encourages Complainants of sexual harassment to file a complaint and note that for some persons the filing of a complaint may be compulsory. Complaints may be filed with the designated offices detailed in this Student Code of Conduct and/or in Policy 0-004 Sexual Misconduct/Sexual Harassment (Including Sexual Violence). 77 F. Any individual may refer a student for an alleged violation of this Student Code of Conduct by filing a written referral with OSRR. OSRR also reserves the right to initiate or follow up any investigative leads where there is reasonable belief of possible violations of this Student Code of Conduct. G. The conduct process may be initiated against a student charged with conduct that potentially violates both the criminal law and/or the Student Code of Conduct without regard to the pending civil or criminal litigation in court or criminal arrest and prosecution. The conduct process under this Regulation may be carried out prior to, simultaneously with, or following civil or criminal proceedings off campus at the discretion of OSRR. Determinations made or sanction(s) imposed as a result of this Student Code of Conduct process shall not be subject to change because criminal charges arising out of the same facts giving rise to violation(s) of University policies were dismissed, reduced, or resolved in favor of or against the criminal law defendant. Members of the University community, who commit offenses against the laws of municipalities, states, or the United States, are subject to prosecution by those authorities and may be subject to disciplinary action under University rules when their conduct violates institutional standards. Student shall not be forced to present self-incriminating evidence; however, the University is not required to postpone the conduct process pending the outcome of any civil or criminal case. III. DEFINITION OF TERMS A. \"Administrative Hold\" refers to a restrictive hold being placed on a student's record at any point in the conduct process to assure compliance with sanctions or pending the resolution of conduct matters.

E. \"Charged Student\" means the student against whom the Initial Review Officer has filed official charges. F. \"Complainant\" is a term used in this Regulation to refer to the person who submits a referral alleging that a student or organization violated the Student Code of Conduct. In specific cases, the Complainant may not be the actual victim or the alleged victim. Recognizing that the law provides victims and alleged victims specific rights and non- victim complainants may not have the same rights or protections, this Code will use \"Complainant\" as a general term and the Code will be applied to fit the particular circumstances at the discretion of OSRR. G. \"Conduct Process\" refers to the entire process outlined in this Student Code of Conduct, including Initial Review, Emergency Provisional Suspension Review, the Formal Hearing, and Appeal process.

K. \"Deferred Adjudication\" refers to the process when a student is responsible for a violation but the circumstance would allow for an alternative resolution of the situation. The finding is deferred by the Initial Review Officer until the completion of all requirements (sanctions and/or restrictions). In order to receive deferred adjudication, the student must begin by accepting responsibility. At the completion of all requirements the student is adjudicated \"not responsible\" and the case is listed on a students' record as a dismissal after the completion of deferred adjudication.

If the student chooses not to attend, the Initial Review Officer reserves the right to have an In Absentia Review, at which point a Charge Letter will be sent to the student. 2. \"Provisional Suspension Letter\" refers to a letter sent to a Referred Student explaining that a Referral has been received and the circumstances explained in the Referral are severe enough to cause concern for the safety and well-being for the USF campus and community. This letter states that the Referred Student is immediately suspended from the University (the right to be on campus and attend in person or virtual classes) and/or from participating in official University functions, programs, intercollegiate competitions, and other student activities pending an emergency Formal Hearing. This Formal Hearing is held to determine if the Referred Student can return to campus and class while the conduct process continues. 3. \"Charge Letter\" refers to notice issued by the Initial Review Officer, stating that a referral has been dismissed or moved forward in the conduct process. In the case where the referral has been moved forward, the Letter will include the notice of the charges and recommended sanctions that may be accepted by the Charged Student or reviewed in a Formal Hearing, which may result in a not responsible finding or a responsible finding, which could result in greater or lesser sanctions. 4. \"Hearing Decision Letter\" refers to the notice from the OSRR to a Charged Student stating the Formal Hearing outcomes and sanctions. 5. \"Dean's Decision on Appeal Letter\" refers to the notice from the Dean of Students, or designee, at the conclusion of the appeal process.

B. Stages of Conduct Process: 1. Receipt of Referral: OSRR receives a Referral that is filed within a reasonable time following the discovery of the alleged violation and no later than six (6) months after the discovery, except in extraordinary cases. A Referral may be initiated by a student, faculty member, University Police personnel, staff member, office personnel, or interested party to the University. The Director of OSRR or designee may request information concerning prior misconduct of the Referred Student from the University Police and other appropriate persons or offices. OSRR will then send the Referred Student notice of the Referral through either (1) an Initial Review Letter informing the Referred Student of the Initial Review Process, or (2) a Provisional Suspension Letter informing the Referred Student of the Provisional Suspension Process. This notice will be sent to the Referred Student's University email 84 account on file with the Office of the Registrar. For student organizations, this notice will be sent to the University email account of the presiding officer of the organization (President). 2. Initial Review Process: a. If the University does not impose a Provisional Suspension, OSRR will notify the Referred Student that a Referral has been made by sending the Referred Student an Initial Review Letter. The Initial Review Letter will inform the Referred Student of an alleged incident that took place and will either request the Referred Student schedule a meeting or will inform the Referred Student that a meeting has already been scheduled. The Initial Review Letter will also include notice to the Referred Student of any interim temporary restriction or sanctions if appropriate. If the Referred Student(s) appear(s) for the Initial Review Meeting, an Initial Review as to the appropriate charges will be made by the Initial Review Officer. If the Referred Student(s) fails to appear for the Initial Review Meeting (or any step in this process), the Initial Review Officer will conduct an In Absentia Review (a review without the Referred Student present) and make a determination as to the appropriate charges to be filed and send the Charge Letter. The Initial Review Officer will conclude the Initial Review Process within six (6) weeks of Receipt of Referral, unless an extension is necessary as determined and documented by the Initial Review Officer. 3. Conclusion of Initial Review Process: a. At the conclusion of the Initial Review Meeting/In Absentia Review, the Initial Review Officer will issue a Charge Letter, which will indicate (1) the Referral has been dismissed or (2) the Referral is moved forward with the recommended charges and sanctions. At this point, if the Referral is not dismissed, the Referred Student (for purposes of this Student Code of Conduct) now becomes the Charged Student. The Charge Letter will indicate the choices available to the Charged Student, which are to accept responsibility or to request a Formal Hearing. 4. Formal Hearing: a. Forums - The Charged Student may elect a Formal Hearing to review the recommended charges found in the Charge Letter, understanding that the Formal Hearing may result in charges being upheld or dismissed and sanctions that are more severe or less severe than the sanctions provided by the Initial Review Officer. The University provides two (2) choices of forum for the Formal Hearing: (a) a Formal Hearing before an Administrative Hearing Officer, which includes a specific waiver of a Formal Hearing before a University Conduct Board or (b) a Formal Hearing before a University Conduct Board, which would then include a specific waiver of a Formal Hearing before an Administrative Hearing Officer. This choice must be made and submitted in writing within five (5) days of the date of the Charge Letter. In the event the Charged Student fails to notify the IRO of the election of either 1) accepting responsibility (form to be provided by OSRR) and agreeing to the terms and sanctions imposed by the Charge Letter or 2) selecting a choice of forum for the Formal Hearing, the recommended charges and sanctions in the Charge Letter will become a Final OSRR Decision. At the discretion of the OSRR, any Formal Hearing may be postponed pending the gathering of additional evidence or the outcome of a related proceeding. In cases of sexual harassment or at the discretion of the University, the University reserves the right to designate that the Formal Hearing be conducted by an Administrative Hearing Officer. The two choices of forum for the Formal Hearing are as follows: (1) Administrative Hearing Officer Formal Hearing - If the Charged Student elects a Formal Hearing before an Administrative Hearing Officer, OSRR will assign an Administrative Hearing Officer to conduct the Formal Hearing. The Charged Student (and the Complainant in cases of sexual harassment and specific acts of violence as defined in Section 4.24 of this Student Code of Conduct) shall be notified of the person appointed to be the Administrative Hearing Officer. (2) University Conduct Board Formal Hearing - If the Charged Student elects a Formal Hearing before a University Conduct Board, OSRR will assign a panel where students will make up at least one-half of the membership, except in cases of sexual harassment (See Section (IV)(E)). The Board members will be selected from a bank of faculty/staff and students. Any Board member assigned to hear the case, but who is not present for the presentation of information at the Formal Hearing may not further participate. However, the Charged Student has the right to 85 choose to proceed or to request that the Formal Hearing be rescheduled if the University Conduct Board present does not have at least one-half of the membership made up of students. After the Formal Hearing, the Board will reach its decision in executive session. A simple majority of the quorum is required for decision. b. Guidelines - When the OSRR receives a timely request (within five (5) days from the date of the Charge Letter) for a Formal Hearing, the Formal Hearing will be scheduled to take place within six (6) weeks from the date of the Charge Letter, except in circumstances which may be identified by the OSRR, which may include holidays or University scheduling conflicts. The OSRR will provide the Charged Student with guidelines and information including the rights of the Charged Student to contact OSRR and schedule a time to review the documents in the file that may be used in the Formal Hearing no less than three (3) days before the Formal Hearing, except in cases of a Provisional Suspension Review or if waived by the Charged Student. The Administrative Hearing Officer and/or University Conduct Board will have five (5) days to reach an outcome. The outcomes of the Formal Hearing held by the Administrative Hearing Officer or the University Conduct Board are recommendations to the Director of OSRR or designee. The Director of OSRR or designee will render a Final OSRR Decision within five (5) days of the receipt of the recommendations. Any differences between the recommendation and the Final OSRR Decision, and the reasons, will be presented to the Charged Student in writing. 5. Appeal Process: The Charged Student, or the Complainant in specific cases as provided in this Student Code of Conduct, may appeal in writing the Final OSRR Decision within five (5) days of the date of the letter describing the decision, except in cases where the Charged Student has accepted responsibility or the Charged Student has failed to notify the OSRR of the choice of forum for the Formal Hearing. The appeal must be written to the Dean of Students or appropriate designee at the member institution or separately accredited institution. If an appeal is granted, the burden of proof rests with the Charged Student or the Complainant to show, by a preponderance of the evidence presented, that the grounds for an appeal have been made. The Dean of Students may adopt, modify, or reject the Final OSRR Decision and/or sanctions from the Final OSRR Decision. The record of the Formal Hearing may be considered on appeal as well as any new information from the Charged Student and/or Complainant that comes to the attention of the Dean of Students. The Dean of Students is authorized to contact any participants in the Formal Hearing for clarification and the Charged Student is entitled to review the record of the Formal Hearing at the University by requesting a review time. a. Basis of Appeal - Except as required to explain the basis of new information, the Dean shall limit the review of the verbatim record of the Formal Hearing and supporting documents for one or more of the following purposes: (1) To determine if there were due process errors involving the University's failure to provide the Charged Student or organization with notice or an opportunity be heard. (2) To determine whether the sanction(s) imposed was extraordinarily disproportionate for the violation of the Student Code of Conduct, which the Charged Student was found to be responsible. (3) To consider new information, sufficient to alter a decision or other relevant facts not brought out in the Formal Hearing, because such information and/or facts were not known to the person appealing at the time of the Formal Hearing. Outcomes of criminal or civil cases have no bearing in any aspect of the process, including the appeal. b. When the appeal is submitted, the Charged Student must state the reason(s) for the appeal and must supply the supporting facts and the recommended solution. This is not a re-hearing of the conduct case. An appeal will not be accepted simply because a student is dissatisfied with the decision. Failure to describe the nature of the information in full detail and/or failure to list and explain at least one (1) of the three (3) bases of acceptable appeals will result in the denial of the appeal. c. The Dean's Decision on Appeal Letter will be rendered within ten (10) days of receipt of the appeal, except in extraordinary cases as determined by the Dean of Students. The decision made by the Dean of Students is to be rendered in the Dean's Decision on Appeal Letter and the Dean's Decision is considered the Final University Decision. If an appeal is not upheld, the matter shall be considered final and binding upon all involved. If the final 86 appellate decision results in a suspension or expulsion of a Charged Student, the Charged Student will be notified in writing that the decision may be appealed by the student to an external judicial forum as provided in Section (IV)(D) below. 6. Provisional Suspension Review Process: The Provisional Suspension may be imposed by the President or OSRR upon Receipt of Referral. In certain circumstances, the University may immediately impose a Provisional Suspension at any time during the Conduct Process. The President of the University or OSRR or their designee, will have the authority to immediately suspend a student from the University or from participating in official University functions, programs, intercollegiate competitions, and other student activities (\"Provisional Suspension\") by issuing a Provisional Suspension Letter. A Provisional Suspension may be imposed to ensure the safety and well-being of members of the University community or preservation of University property; to ensure the physical or emotional safety and well-being of the members of the University community; or when the student's continued presence or use of privilege at the University is likely to pose an ongoing threat of disruption or interference with the normal operation of the University. Students issued a Provisional Suspension from the University will be provided an Emergency Provisional Suspension Review Meeting with the Director of OSRR, or designee, within five (5) days from the date of the Provisional Suspension Letter. Absent an election by the Referred Student to accept full responsibility of the alleged violation (form to be provided by OSRR), the Director of OSRR, or designee, will conduct the Emergency Provisional Suspension Review Meeting to determine whether to lift the Provisional Suspension and/or to schedule a Formal Hearing before an Administrative Hearing Officer. The decision of the Director of OSRR, or designee, will be communicated to the Referred Student via a Charge Letter. If the Director of OSRR, or designee, decides to lift the Provisional Suspension, the Referred Student may be allowed to resume certain activities on campus which may include the return to classes or university housing, if applicable. If the Referred Student fails to appear for the Emergency Provisional Suspension Review Meeting and fails to accept full responsibility in writing via the OSRR form, the Director of OSRR, or designee, will review the Provisional Suspension in the Referred Student's absence. 7. Conclusion of Provisional Suspension Review Process - Conclusion of Provisional Suspension Review Process: At the conclusion of the Emergency Provisional Suspension Review Meeting, the Director of OSRR, or designee, will issue a Charge Letter, which will indicate (1) the Referral and the Provisional Suspension have been dismissed and/or lifted; (2) the Provisional Suspension is lifted and the Referral is moved forward with the recommended charges and sanctions; or (3) the Provisional Suspension is continued and the Referral is moved forward with the recommended charges and sanctions. For purposes of this Student Code of Conduct, if the Referral is not dismissed, the Referred Student now becomes the \"Charged Student.\" If possible, the Charge Letter will include a tentative Formal Hearing date (set no sooner than three (3) days or longer than six (6) weeks from the Emergency Provisional Suspension Review Meeting, unless the Charged Student waives the review period and the Director of OSRR, or designee, is able to schedule the Formal Hearing sooner or more time is needed as determined by the Director of OSRR, or designee, with notice to the Charged Student before the end of the six (6) weeks). At any time in the Provisional Suspension Review Process, a student may elect to accept responsibility (form to be provided by OSRR) and agree to the terms and sanctions imposed by the Charge Letter. If the Charged Student accepts responsibility following the Emergency Provisional Suspension Review Meeting, the Charged Student is electing to waive all rights to a Formal Hearing and is requesting the Director of OSRR, or designee, make a Final OSRR Decision with regard to the substantive charges, and is accepting that determination as a Final OSRR Decision with a waiver of appeal rights except to the severity of the sanction, which the Charged Student may appeal. If the Charged Student does not elect to accept responsibility, a Formal Hearing to review the recommended charges found in the Charge Letter will take place with an Administrative Hearing Officer, unless the Charged Student elects a University Conduct Board. C. General Principles of Conduct Process: 1. General Principles. Unless otherwise specified: a. All proceedings will be closed to spectators. 87 b. No irrelevant information should be discussed or considered in the Formal Hearing. c. This document provides the process and evidentiary guidelines for this internal University process. Civil and Criminal rules of evidence and procedure do not apply. d. The Administrative Hearing Officer or Chairperson of the University Conduct Board has the discretion to allocate time allotments for the Formal Hearing and testimony time. e. At the conclusion of the appeals process, the decision of the Dean of Students or the appropriate designee is a Final University Decision and there are no further internal University appeals. f. After the Final University Decision, a student may seek judicial review pursuant to Florida Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.190(b)(3) by filing a petition for certiorari review with the appropriate circuit court within thirty (30) days of the Final University Decision. If a person seeks review with the court, a copy of the petition must also be officially served to the University of South Florida Office of the General Counsel at University of South Florida, CGS 301, 4202 E. Fowler Avenue, Tampa, Florida 33620-4301. g. Charged Students and Complainants may have an advisor of their choice present; however, University employees who have a potential conflict of interest are not to serve. The advisor may be present to speak with and advise the Charged Student/Complainant, but may not speak on behalf of, act as attorney, present the case for, nor otherwise participate directly in the Initial Review or in the Formal Hearing. It is the Charged Student's/Complainant's responsibility to make appropriate arrangements for travel, costs, and attendance for the advisor. The Initial Review or the Formal Hearing shall not be delayed due to scheduling conflicts of the chosen advisor. D. Rights of Charged Students and Complainants: 1. Rights of the Charged Student: a. Provision of Proof - The provision of proof shall be the duty of the OSRR. The level of proof for a decision shall be \"preponderance of the evidence,\" that is, from the evidence/information submitted, it is more likely than not that the Charged Student did commit the violation(s) for which the student has been charged, and shall not be the strict criminal law standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. b. Record - A Formal Hearing shall be recorded by audio tape or video. Deliberations shall not be recorded. The record will be the property of the University. A Charged Student and the Charged Student's Advisor may not record any proceeding. c. Review of Information - The Charged Student may review the evidence in the possession of the University that will be presented against the Charged Student at the University under the direction of OSRR. The University has the right to request to review any information the Charged Student intends to present at least three (3) days (excluding legal holidays) before the Formal Hearing. Pertinent records, exhibits and written statements may be accepted as information for consideration by the Initial Review Officer or Formal Hearing forum. d. Presentation of Information - The Charged Student may present evidence on the Charged Student's own behalf. e. Question Witnesses (Applicable to Formal Hearing) - The Charged Student may hear and submit questions to be used to question adverse witnesses who testify at the Formal Hearing, except in the certain cases of violent or sexual misconduct, which may require specific protocols to be followed. The Charged Student may submit questions for the Formal Hearing three (3) days before the Formal Hearing to OSRR. The Administrative Hearing Officer or Chairperson of the University Conduct Board will determine if the questions relate to the alleged incident and are appropriate to be presented at the Formal Hearing before presenting them to the witnesses. The Charged Student may hear adverse witnesses who testify at the Formal Hearing and submit questions to be asked of those witnesses. 88 In the event a scheduled witness does not appear, a written statement may be submitted at least three (3) days before the Formal Hearing. However, if the written statement is submitted in less than three (3) days before the Formal Hearing, once notified of the written statement, the Charged Student may request a continuation to permit the three (3) day review of the newly provided evidence or may affirmatively waive the three (3) day review requirement. The Charged Student must be provided an opportunity to respond to the statement. f. Right to Challenge Impartiality of: (1) Administrative Hearing Officer - The Charged Student and the Complainant in certain circumstances have the right to challenge the impartiality of the Administrative Hearing Officer in writing to OSRR within three (3) days of notification (or in cases of an emergency nature within twenty-four (24) hours of the scheduled Formal Hearing). An Administrative Hearing Officer whose impartiality is challenged by reasonable rationale will be excused. Indiscriminate impartiality challenges shall entitle the OSRR to proceed without regard to the challenge. If an Administrative Hearing Officer is excused, at the discretion of the OSRR, a new Administrative Hearing Officer will be assigned if time permits. Otherwise, the Formal Hearing will be rescheduled. No students may contact, directly or indirectly, any Administrative Hearing Officer regarding this process before, during, or after the Formal Hearing and a violation of this restriction may be considered a violation of this Student Code of Conduct. (2) University Conduct Board Member - The Charged Student and the Complainant in certain circumstances have the right to challenge the impartiality of any Board member in writing to OSRR within three (3) days of notification (or in cases of an emergency nature within twenty-four (24) hours of the scheduled Formal Hearing). A Board member whose impartiality is challenged by reasonable rationale will be excused. Indiscriminate impartiality challenges shall entitle the panel to proceed without regard to the challenge. If a Board member is excused, at the discretion of the OSRR, the Formal Hearing will continue as scheduled, provided there is at least one student and one faculty/staff member on the panel. No students may contact, directly or indirectly, any Board member regarding this process before, during, or after the Formal Hearing and a violation of this restriction may be considered a violation of this Student Code of Conduct. g. Response to Presented Information - The Charged Student shall not be forced to present testimony or respond to questions. h. Decision Based on Presented Information - Decisions of the University Conduct Board or Administrative Hearing Officer shall be based solely on the evidence presented, including any file referencing prior misconduct or meetings with the Charged Student in the custody of the OSRR. i. Decision in Writing - Decisions of the University Conduct Board or Administrative Hearing Officer, including findings of fact and a determination of sanction, if any, shall be presented to the Charged Student in writing within ten (10) days following the Hearing in a Hearing Decision Letter. j. Enrollment Status - The Charged Student's enrollment status will remain unchanged pending the Final OSRR decision, except in cases of Provisional Suspension. The Final OSRR Decision will reflect how the enrollment status of the Charged Student will be treated between the Final OSRR Decision and a possible appeal to the Dean and the Dean's Decision. A Charged Student shall remain eligible to attend classes and University activities pending the Final OSRR Decision, which shall indicate if recommended sanctions are to be imposed immediately (in case of suspension or expulsion or to protect the health or safety of the University) or deferred until after the appeal is concluded. In cases where the President or President's designee determines that the health, safety, or welfare of the Charged Student or the University community is involved, a Charged Student's privileges within the University, including the ability to attend classes or engage in University activities, may be suspended on an interim basis. If a Charged Student's privileges are temporarily revoked as described in this paragraph, but the Charged Student is subsequently found not responsible for the violation, the University must: 89 (1) Correct any record of the change in enrollment status in the Charged Student's permanent records and reports in a manner compliant with state and federal laws; and (2) Refund to the Charged Student: a pro rata portion of any charges for tuition and out-of-state fees, as appropriate, if the temporary revocation or suspension of the Charged Student's ability to attend classes lasts for more than ten (10) days. k. Failure to Appear - If a Charged Student fails to appear for any Hearing, the matter may be resolved in the Charged Student's absence. 2. Rights of the Complainant: a. Formal Hearing Questions - The Complainant shall have the right to submit a list of questions to OSRR for use during the Formal Hearing. The OSRR shall ask the Charged Student the questions provided the OSRR determines the questions relate to the alleged incident and are appropriate to be presented at the Formal Hearing. E. Additional Rights of Charged Students and Complainants in Cases of Alleged Violent Conduct and Sexual Harassment: In cases of sexual harassment (as defined in Section 4.14 of this Student Code of Conduct) and specific acts of violence (as defined in Section 4.24 of this Student Code of Conduct), the Charged Student and the Complainant, shall be notified of the persons selected to hear the case during the Formal Hearing.

This record of requests/disclosures shall include the following information: 1. The name of the person or agency that made the request. 2. The interest the person or agency had in the information. 3. The date the person or agency made the request. 4. Whether the request was granted and, if it was, the date access was permitted or the disclosure was made. b. The University will maintain this record of requests/disclosures as long as it maintains the student's education record. 10. Procedures to Request Amendment of and Challenge Education Records. . Students have the right to, in accordance with this Regulation, request amendment of and challenge the content of their education records. a. Definitions. 1. The term \"incorrect\" is used herein to describe a record that is inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of the privacy or other rights of students. A record is not \"incorrect,\" for purposes of this Regulation, where the requestor wishes to challenge the evaluation reflected by the grade an instructor assigns for a course. 2. The term \"requestor\" is used herein to describe a student or former student who is requesting the University to amend a record. b. Students who believe that their education records contain information which is incorrect should informally discuss the problem with the record custodian. If the record custodian finds the information is incorrect because of an obvious error, and it is a simple matter to amend it to the satisfaction of the requestor, the record custodian may make the amendment. c. If the record custodian cannot amend the record to the requestor's satisfaction or if the record does not appear to be obviously incorrect, the record custodian will: 1. Provide the requestor a copy of the questioned record at no cost; and 2. Ask the requestor to initiate and provide the record custodian a written request for the amendment; such written request must identify the information which the requestor believes is incorrect, must state why such information is incorrect, and must be dated and signed by the requestor. d. The record custodian will send the request, together with a written explanation of his/her refusal to amend the record to the requestor's satisfaction, to the FERPA Coordinator. The FERPA Coordinator will examine the request, discuss it with appropriate USF System officials, including the person who initiated the record, the USF System General Counsel, and other persons who might have an interest in the questioned record. At the conclusion of this investigation, the FERPA Coordinator will summarize his/her findings, make a recommendation for USF System's action, and deliver the request, the record custodian's written explanation, his/her summary of findings, and his/her recommendation to the USF System President (President). e. The President will instruct the FERPA Coordinator whether the record should or should not be amended in accordance with the request. If the President's decision is to amend the record, the FERPA Coordinator 101 will advise the record custodian to make the amendment. The record custodian will advise the requestor in writing when he/she has amended the record and invite the requestor to inspect the record. f. If the President's decision is that the record is correct and should not be amended, the FERPA Coordinator will prepare and send the requestor a letter stating the decision. Parents and eligible students who need assistance or who wish to file a complaint under FERPA or the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA) should do so in writing to the Family Policy Compliance Office, sending pertinent information through the mail, concerning any allegations to the following address: Family Policy Compliance Office; U.S. Department of Education; 400 Maryland Avenue, SW; Washington, D.C. 20202-5920; Phone: 1-800-USA-LEARN (1-800-872-5327). g. In the event the education records are not amended to the requestor's satisfaction, the requestor shall have the right to place with the education records a written statement explaining, commenting upon, or disagreeing with information contained in the education records. This statement shall be maintained as part of the student's education record for as long as the USF System maintains the questioned part of the record. Whenever the questioned part of the record is disclosed, the student's written statement shall also be disclosed. 11. Right of Waiver of Access.The USF System may request a waiver of access to evaluations and letters of recommendation related to admissions, employment applications and receipt of honors. While such a waiver may be requested, requests for waivers do not constitute a pre-condition for admission, financial aid, or any services or benefits. Upon request, students who have waived access to such items can receive a listing of all individuals providing confidential recommendations or evaluations. Authority: Art. IX, Sec. 7, Fla.

History - New (BOT Amended 10-3-12 Amended 11-10-15 (Technical). 102 Testing and Final Examinations USF Policy 10-005: Testing and Final Examinations I. PURPOSE & INTENT Examinations in academic subjects are, for most courses, an integral part of the learning process and one part of a procedure for evaluating student performance and determining grades. The University of South Florida System (USF System) requires certain standards for the examination process in order to protect the academic integrity of courses and the best interests of both the student and instructor. Although this policy primarily addresses examinations for undergraduate courses, graduate courses with final exams during the examination week should follow the schedule for exams that is provided with the course schedule for that academic term. II. APPLICABILITY & AUTHORITY This Policy does not apply to the USF Health Colleges. III. STATEMENT OF POLICY A. Testing in General In each academic course the student is expected to undergo a meaningful testing and evaluation that will reveal the student's intellectual growth in the subject matter covered or otherwise reflect the achievement of the course objectives. The instructor has the responsibility of maintaining a fair and impartial testing and examination procedure, has the right to define and structure the testing process, and shall not be restricted as to form, style, or content of the examination. It is the policy of the USF System that all students facing an examination (of any type) shall have equal notice of said examination. The USF System regards the routine use of all or part of the same formal examination for successive academic terms as unsound policy except when used with adequate safeguards such as a random selection of questions from a large pool. B. Designated Reading Days Effective, Spring 2016, two instructional days of the Fall and Spring terms will be determined and designated Reading Days for all courses including semester length distance learning courses. Alternate calendar courses may not include designated Reading Days and students electing to take those courses should refer to their syllabus or instructor direction. Accordingly, classes will not be scheduled on those two days. Refer to the University Catalog (Policy 10-059) for specific dates and calendars for each academic term. C. Final Course Examinations The last six (6) days of the Fall and Spring semesters shall be set aside for final examinations and any final examination of a comprehensive nature must be given during this designated period. The period of two hours shall be allotted for each final examination. 1. Exceptions to Final Course Exam Take-home final examinations, papers, projects, practicums, and competency examinations are exceptions to the above rule and may be scheduled for completion at any time at the discretion of the instructor. 103 2. Final Exam Matrix The Final Exam Matrix for the Tampa Main Campus (Matrix) is designated to facilitate a conflict-free schedule for greater student success in the exam process. All Tampa Main Campus courses must comply to the Matrix as it is published with no deviations. All make-up exams, either for block exams or the individual exams, will be scheduled during the time period allotted for students that require a make-up exam. 3. Conflicts If a student has a direct conflict of scheduled examinations that are scheduled according to the Final Exam Matrix or the exam schedule available at a USF System Institution, the student may petition the appropriate instructor to reschedule one of the student's examinations. If a student has three or more examinations scheduled on the same day, the student may petition the appropriate instructor to reschedule one of the student's examinations or the student may elect to take all exams on the same day. If a make-up exam is requested, it will be scheduled during the make-up exam time as posted on the Final Exam Matrix. The \"appropriate instructor\" in case of examination time conflicts shall be determined by the following ordered list of priorities: a. If a student has an exam conflict between courses offered on different campuses or institutions within the USF System, the course on the student's home campus has priority. b. Block finals have priority over non-block finals. When two block finals conflict, the higher numbered course takes priority. c. Apart from block finals priority, examinations for graduate level courses have priority over examinations for undergraduate level courses. d. Apart from block finals priority and within the level of the courses, undergraduate or graduate, examinations for numerically higher numbered courses have a priority over lower numbered courses. e. If after applying items 1 through 4, there remains a conflict, priority shall be given to the course with the prefix closest to the beginning of the alphabet. f. The instructor of the course not receiving priority shall provide for a make-up exam either in accordance with the designated make-up exam periods or at a mutually acceptable time for both the instructor and the student during the exam period. The final examination schedule shall be published in the same manner and place as the schedule of classes. 104 Tobacco and Smoke Free University USF Policy 0-608 SM I.

AUTHORITY USF System Policy, 0-606, Non Smoking Areas, Section II. 105 Tuition and Fees Telephone: 941-359-4220 Websites: www.usfsm.edu/campus-life/campus-resources/business-office/ USF System Regulation USF4.0102: Tuition and USF System Regulation USF4.0107: Fees, Fines, and Penalties USF System Regulation USF4.0108: Waiver of Tuition and Fees Registration tuition and fees are assessed in accordance with University Board of Trustees rules, per USF System Regulation 4.0102, and are subject to change without prior notice. The USF System will make every effort to advertise any such changes if they occur. Tuition and fee rates are posted on the websites for the USFSM Cashier and the USF System Controller. Schedules/Fee Statements are not mailed to the student. It is the student's responsibility to review their financial account for accuracy and pay their tuition and fees in full by the appropriate due date as stated at http://www.usf.edu/business-finance/controller/student-services/deadline-dates.aspx. Failure to do so may result in cancellation of the student's registration. Unless the student has received a tuition and fee payment deferment (i.e., Financial Aid or Veterans), tuition and fees are due by the fifth day of each academic term. Students may view and/or pay their current term tuition and fees online by accessing the \"Tuition, Fees & Payments\" menu option in OASIS at https://webauth.usf.edu. Cash, checks and money orders are accepted at the USFSM Cashier's Office for payment of tuition and fees. Checks, made payable to USF, may be mailed to the USFSM Cashier's office, but must be postmarked by the U.S. Post Office, not office metered, by the applicable fee payment deadline. The University cannot be responsible for lost or misdirected U.S. Postal mail. Payment of tuition and fees by MasterCard, Discover or American Express debit or credit cards must be made online through OASIS. Please note that the University no longer accepts Visa cards for payment of tuition and fees. E-checks are also accepted through OASIS. Excess Hours Surcharge In 2009, the Florida Legislature implemented Section 1009.286, Florida Statutes to encourage students to complete their baccalaureate degree as quickly and efficiently as possible. It established what is commonly referred to as an \"Excess Credit Hour Surcharge.\" The provisions of this section became effective for students who entered a Florida community college or a Florida state university for the first time in the 2009-2010 academic year and thereafter. The bill requires universities to add a surcharge to each credit hour taken in excess of the total hours calculated, based on a percentage defined in law. See the following table: Students Entering as FTIC SUS (First Time in College State University System of Florida) or FTIC FCS (First Time in College Florida College System) Fees to be Charged Prior to Fall 2009 None Fall 2009 - Summer 2011 50% for credits above 120% of total program hours 106 Fall 2011 - Summer 2012 100% for credits above 115% of total program hours Fall 2012 and thereafter 100% for credits above 110% of total program hours The surcharge is assessed only on the tuition portion of the semester hour cost, not on the fees. The number of total program hours required for the baccalaureate degree will be identified by the student's declared major. This is typically 120 semester hours, although some programs have been approved to require more than 120 semester hours. For further information, see the Board of Governors Regulation 7.003(21). Note: No institution may waive the excess hours surcharge as the language of the statute is mandatory. Repeat Course Surcharge Initiated by the Florida Legislature (H.B. 1545 of 1997) to reduce costs, Section 1009.285 Florida Statutes requires that all state universities must monitor undergraduate student progress and charge students the \"full cost of instruction\" for certain repeats of undergraduate courses. This policy became effective in Fall 1997 and requires USF System Institutions to charge students a substantial per credit hour surcharge when they attempt a course three or more times within the USF System, unless the course is specifically designed to be repeated or is required to be repeated by their major. Requirements to earn a passing or higher grade than previously earned in a course do not exempt the surcharge. Students will be required to pay the surcharge in addition to the appropriate in-state or out-of-state tuition rates. It is important to note that all attempts count, including withdrawals after the first week of classes and courses with incomplete grades. The USF System may grant exceptions to this rule based on extenuating circumstances and financial hardship. However, the USF System may only approve one appeal per course. Documentation, regardless of the situation, must be submitted with the request for a waiver of this surcharge. Extenuating circumstances are those circumstances determined by the University to be exceptional and beyond the control of the student and may include, but not be limited to, the following: Serious illness Documented medical condition preventing completion Death of an immediate family member Involuntary call to active duty University error Other emergency circumstances or extraordinary situations The criteria used by the USF System for determining financial hardship should include, but not be limited to, qualification for federal need-based financial aid. Students with other documented financial hardships may also be considered. The student must complete a Fee Adjustment Request Form and indicate that the request is for a waiver of the repeat course surcharge. They must also submit a statement that explains their request and provide all documentation relating to it. The completed form, with documentation, should be submitted to the Office of the Registrar for consideration. 107 Florida Prepaid College Program Website: http://www.usf.edu/business-finance/controller/student-services/student-accounting/florida-prepaid.aspx Students participating in the Florida Prepaid College Program are responsible for paying all tuition and fees not covered under their Florida Prepaid Plan by the applicable payment deadline to avoid being assessed a $100.00 late payment fee. Tuition Deferment for VA Students Website: www.usf.edu/student-affairs/veterans/apply/tuition-deferment.aspx Students receiving Veterans Administration (VA) benefits who have applied in writing no later than the date specified within the Veterans Affairs website have until the applicable payment deadline to pay registration tuition and fee balances in full. Intern Certificate of Participation Individuals who have supervised interns, and who have registered for courses during an academic term, may present their Intern Certificate of Participation to the USFSM Cashier's Office. The Certificate of Participation entitles holders to a waiver of only matriculation fees for a maximum of six (6) credit hours of instruction during a single academic term. Certificates are valid for three (3) years from the date of issuance. Tuition and fees not covered by the Certificate of Participation must be paid by the fifth day of the academic term in order to avoid assessment of a $100.00 late payment fee. Employee Tuition Program The USF System Employee Tuition Program authorizes full-time USF System employees who are appointed to permanent established positions to enroll in USF credit courses for a maximum of six (6) credit hours per academic term. Summer sessions A, B, and C are considered to be parts of one academic term. The employee must be appointed prior to the first day of class and expected to be employed full-time past the end of the academic term for which enrolled. For additional information, please visit the Human Resources website. 108 Senior Citizen Tuition Waiver Program Florida residents who are 60 years of age or older as of registration day, and have lived in Florida for the last 12 months, may enroll, on a space-available basis, in certain undergraduate and graduate courses without paying fees. The Senior Citizen Tuition Waiver covers a maximum of twelve (12) credit hours per academic term and is applicable only if the student registers for these courses during the designated registration period. Due to the audit status, academic credit is not awarded, examinations are not required, and grades are not assigned. A parking permit, purchased from USFSM Parking Services, is required. Students need not be present in order to register for courses; the Application and Registration worksheet may be submitted by mail, fax, or in person. It is the student's responsibility to complete and submit the waiver forms allowing sufficient time for the forms to reach the Registrar's Office by the registration deadline. Forms submitted after the registration deadline will not be processed. Some courses require college approval, prerequisites, or have other restrictions which may limit registration. The necessary permits should be acquired in advance of registration. Additionally, the permits may be submitted electronically in OASIS by the issuing college. Under no circumstances will notes on plain paper without college letterhead be accepted. Students may not pre-register for courses in which they plan to use the Senior Citizen Tuition Waiver. The waiver will not be processed if a senior citizen pre-registers and then submits a Senior Citizen Tuition Waiver form for those courses. More information about the program can be found at the Office of the Registrar's website. The Application Packet and Registration worksheet are on the USFSM Registration website, usfsm.edu/registration/. Cancellation for Non-Payment of Tuition and Fees USF System Regulation USF4.010: Cancellation of Registration for Nonpayment of Tuition and Fees and Returned Checks In Payment of Tuition Students not on an authorized deferred payment of tuition and fees and who have not paid their tuition and fees in full by the USF System designated payment deadline date will have their registration for the academic term canceled and will be dropped from classes. Students dropped from classes will receive no credit for courses taken during the academic term. Returned Checks for Registration Tuition and Fees A student's current term registration is subject to cancellation if a check or an e-check presented in payment of tuition is returned to the University by the bank unpaid. A $100 Late Fee Payment and a $25 administrative charge will be assessed on any registration check returned to the University unpaid. Dishonored fee payment checks and associated fees must be paid within 10 calendar days to avoid cancellation of a student's registration for the academic term. 109 Reinstatement from Cancellation for Non-Payment of Tuition and Fees Students who successfully petition for reinstatement from registration cancellation due to non-payment of tuition and fees will be assessed a $100.00 late registration fee and a $100.00 late payment fee. Upon approval for reinstatement, all fees and other debts owed to the University must be paid in full before academic reinstatement will be affected. Payment of Accounts Due the University Charges assessed to students for loss or breakage of University equipment and/or books, fines, and other fees are due immediately. Delinquent accounts may be considered sufficient cause for cancellation of registration. USF System regulations prohibit registration, or release of transcripts, diplomas, or grades for any student whose account with the University is delinquent. Delinquent accounts may be turned over to a collection agency, and all collection costs, including legal fees, will be added to the student's account balance. Financial aid from a succeeding academic year cannot be used to repay prior academic year debts. Refund of Tuition and Fees Payments The following refunds, less deductions for unpaid debts to the University, are authorized. A Refund Request Form must be completed to initiate the refund process. The form may be submitted to the USFSM Cashier's Office or mailed to the address indicated on the bottom of the form. 1. One-hundred percent (100%) of registration fees and tuition will be refunded if notice of withdrawal from the University is approved prior to the end of the drop/add period and written documentation is received from the student. 2. Twenty-five percent (25%) of registration fees and tuition paid, less building and capital improvement fees, will be refunded if notice of withdrawal from \"ALL\" courses from the University is approved prior to the end of the fourth week of classes (Summer term is prior to the end of the third week of classes) and written documentation is received from the student. 3. There is no refund of late registration and late payment fees unless a waiver has been approved. Fee Adjustment Under Exceptional Circumstances One-hundred percent (100%) of tuition and fees may be refunded if, within six (6) months of the end of the academic term to which the refund is applicable, a student who has withdrawn or dropped a course completes and files a Fee Adjustment Request Form with supporting documentation clearly citing extenuating circumstances beyond the student's control with the Registrar's Office. The Registrar's Office will review the form based on the following criteria: Illness of the student, confirmed in writing by a physician, of such severity or duration to preclude completion of the course(s). 110 Death of the student or immediate family member (i.e., parent, spouse, child, or sibling), confirmed by death certificate and obituary indicating the student's relationship to the deceased. Called to active military duty, involuntary or voluntary, confirmed by military orders. A situation in which the USF System is in error, confirmed by the appropriate USF System official in writing on official USF System letterhead. Other exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the student which precluded completion of the course(s), accompanied by both an explanatory letter and verifiable written documentation clearly supporting the student's explanation. Special requests for an extension of the six (6) month deadline must include specific facts supported by written explanation and verifiable documentation. These requests must indicate special circumstances beyond the control of the student which clearly impaired the student's physical or mental ability to correct their academic/financial record at the USF System. Pursuant to Public Law 102-325, the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, students attending the University for the first time who withdraw are entitled to a pro-rata refund of tuition, fees, room and board. A student who receives financial aid and subsequently changes enrollment status which results in a refund in accordance with this section will have the appropriate share of the refund returned to the USF System financial aid programs in accordance with the Financial Aid Policy on Refunds and Repayments. 111 Financial Aid System Regulation USF3.0121: Financial Aid Administration, Distribution and USF of Financial Aid Resources USF System Policy 10-013: Financial Aid Policy on Refunds and Payments USFSM makes every effort to ensure that all qualified students have access to an education. All student financial aid programs are administered or coordinated through the USFSM Office of Admissions and Financial Aid. The above website provides step-by-step guidance through the financial aid application process and lists all deadlines. The Office of Admissions and Financial Aid communicates important information regarding your aid via OASIS and official USF e-mail throughout the year. The USF System Online Access Student Information System (OASIS) allows students to monitor the status of their financial aid from application to disbursement of funds. OASIS can be accessed through your USF NetID at http://my.usf.edu. The first step in obtaining financial aid is to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Be sure to list the University of South Florida System school code 001537 to receive your information. All students wishing to receive financial aid are encouraged to start the financial aid process as early as possible each year (beginning October 1). The USF System priority FAFSA deadline is January 1. Many programs are funded on a limited basis, so it is to your advantage to apply early. Priority application dates and detailed information regarding financial aid are provided each year on our website. Tuition deferments are automatically posted for qualified financial aid applicants. Please check with the USFSM Office of Admissions and Financial Aid for eligibility. Upon satisfaction of eligibility criteria, financial aid will be credited to student accounts after the drop/add period. Monies in excess of charges will be electronically deposited to each student's checking account via eDeposit, or checks will be mailed to student's local address. If you withdraw from USFSM, either officially or unofficially, before the end of a semester, you may be required to repay all or a portion of the aid you received.

USF System institution coursework for a minor must have a GPA of at least 2.00. 5. USFSM undergraduate degree-seeking students are only eligible for minors offered at USFSM. Students at other USF system institutions are not eligible to receive minors at USFSM. 6. A minor can be applied for and received only in conjunction with applying for and receiving a baccalaureate degree, except for students who have already received a baccalaureate degree from USFSM. Those students may earn certification of a minor by taking additional undergraduate coursework at USFSM and applying for the certification. Students who choose to pursue this option must submit the Post-Baccalaureate Minor application to their academic advisor within the first twenty (20) class days of the term they expect to complete the minor requirements. Academic Probation and Academic Dismissal The first time an undergraduate student's USFSM GPA falls below a cumulative 2.00, the student will be placed on Academic Probation (AP). From the beginning of academic probation, the student must maintain at least a 2.00 GPA each term, and may not totally withdraw from any semester without cause. Any student who withdraws from all classes after the fifth day of classes while on Academic Probation will be academically dismissed. Once on academic probation, academic advising prior to registration is mandatory each semester until the student is removed from probationary status. The student may remain on Academic Probation indefinitely as long as the student maintains a GPA of 2.00 or greater each semester. If at any time while on academic probation, the student's semester GPA falls below a 2.00, the student will be academically dismissed from the university. Once academically dismissed, a student may only return to USFSM under the University's Academic Renewal Policy. If academically dismissed from USFSM a student may not return to USFSM as a non-degree-seeking student. Within their first year, first time in college (FTIC) students will be granted a one-time only academic dismissal deferment, allowing an additional semester of enrollment. Students will work with the USFSM FTIC and Persistence Advisor to create a plan for academic success in the deferred semester. It should be noted that deferring academic dismissal will not extend financial aid canceled due to poor academic performance. The determination and notification of probationary status or academic dismissal will be made by the Registrar's Office on the student's semester grade report and academic record. A student who attends another college or university following academic dismissal will be classified as a former student returning and readmission will be based on the total record accumulated from all colleges and universities attended. Once a student's semester and overall GPA is at or above 2.0, the academic probation status will be removed. If a student is academically dismissed or falls below a 2.00 GPA from USFSM and subsequently receives a BA/BS from another four-year institution, that student, when accepted to the University with the post-baccalaureate status, will have his/her academic record cleared. 117 Academic Regulations Committee Website: www.usfsm.edu/academics/academic-resources/academic-advising/arc/ The Academic Regulations Committee (ARC) serves as a board of appeal for USFSM students who wish to secure waiver or modification of University-wide academic regulations. The ARC meets regularly and reviews petitions submitted by undergraduate and non-degree students. Undergraduate and non-degree students must petition and secure approval from the ARC to return to the University after having been academically dismissed or leaving on probation, to receive special consideration regarding an academic regulation, including late or retroactive drop of a course, late registration or late add of a course, deletion of a course, and/or withdrawal from a term. The ARC will re-examine petition decisions on appeal when the student provides new and substantive information directly related to the petition or evidence that an error was made. A final ARC decision may be appealed through the College Dean or designee. The University has implemented a statute of limitations on student petitions for retroactive adds, drops, withdrawals, and registration. A student will be limited to two (2) calendar years (six academic semesters/terms) for such appeals, whether the student is in attendance or not. To petition the ARC, completed forms should be submitted to the office of Academic and Student Affairs, C107. A consultation with the Persistence advisor is required prior to a petition's submission to the ARC. Students may contact their academic advisor for details regarding their submission. The appropriate forms may be obtained on the website or from the academic advising office. Students will receive notification of the committee's decision by email to their USF account. ARC Bylaws Academic Renewal The University's Academic Renewal policy allows students previously dismissed from the university, or former students returning with a USF GPA below 2.00, to renew their pursuit of baccalaureate degrees without the responsibility of having to overcome the entire burden of low grades and low grade point averages. To facilitate this opportunity, students who qualify for Academic Renewal may, with the approval of the ARC, have portions of their academic record excluded from calculation of their grade point averages (GPAs). The entire academic record, however, will continue to be reflected on their transcripts, even though a selected portion will not be counted in their GPAs. Students approved for Academic Renewal are admitted with the same terms of academic probation and dismissal as other undergraduate students. Academic Renewal will only be applied to a student's academic record one time at USF. Students returning to the University under Academic Renewal may incur excess hours and associated monetary penalty. Academic Renewal I (ARI) Students who have been academically dismissed, or former students returning with a USF GPA below 2.00, may petition the ARC to return to the University under ARI. A student may be re-admitted to USFSM under ARI, after completing all requirements for the Associate of Arts degree or equivalent (including general education and the State Communication and Computation Requirements formerly known as Gordon Rule) at a two-year or four-year 118 college. ARI students will enter USFSM as an upper-division student, and their USF grade point average will be calculated from that point forward. While ARI is required for students who have earned less than 60 credit hours, it is not restricted to those students. In order to graduate following re-admission under ARI, all campus and major residency and degree requirements must be met. Students who are admitted under ARI may be excluded from admission to limited-access programs and will not be considered for University Honors at graduation unless they meet the criteria using all grades earned. Academic Renewal II (ARII) ARII is available to students who were academically dismissed, or former students returning with a USF GPA below 2.00, and have 60 or more earned credits from the USF System or other institutions of higher education. These students may be re-admitted to USFSM under ARII after a break in USF enrollment for a full academic year (fall, spring, summer). Students may choose to complete major prerequisites at a non-USF institution during this time, but are not required to do so. Students who choose to take courses at a non-USF institution should meet with the academic advisor of their intended USFSM major prior to enrolling in courses elsewhere. In order to be considered for readmission under ARII, the student must submit a request to the ARC who will make the final decision regarding readmission. Following readmission under ARII, the student will have their USF GPA calculated from that point forward. In order to graduate, following readmission under ARII, all campus and major residency and degree requirements must be met. Students readmitted under ARII may be excluded from admission to limited access programs and will not be considered for University Honors at graduation unless they meet the criteria using all grades earned. Academic Residence USF System Regulation USF3.007 Degree Requirements: Baccalaureate/Undergraduate Any credits transferred from a USF System Institution must be processed as transfer credits from any regionally-accredited institution. Registration and successful completion of at least thirty (30) of the last sixty (60) semester hours at the USF System Institution (home institution) from which the degree is to be conferred. In cases of emergency, a maximum of six (6) hours of the final thirty (30) semester hours may be completed by correspondence or residence at another accredited senior institution with the approval of the academic dean. Exceptions to the home institution rules in this paragraph may be made for students who are enrolled at other universities in USF-approved exchanges, study abroad programs, co-op training programs or correspondence courses from the University of Florida. CLEP credit does not count toward academic residence; Beginning fall semester 2012, must complete successfully at least 50% of the required courses in the major in courses offered by the USF System Institution conferring the degree. In cases of hardship or lack of course availability, individual exceptions may be approved by the respective College Deans or designees to help ensure timely graduation. 119 Associate in Arts Certificate USF Regulation 3.019: Associate in Arts Certificate Upon the student's successful completion of the minimum requirements for the Associate in Arts Certificate, the University of South Florida (University/USF) will present the student who has properly made application with an appropriate Certificate. 1. To receive the Associate in Arts, the student must complete sixty (60) hours of university credit; at least twenty (20) of the last thirty (30) credit hours or a total of thirty-six (36) credit hours must be completed at USF. The minimum grade point average must be 2.00 based on work attempted at USF. In addition, a transfer student must have a GPA of 2.00 or higher when combined with transfer work accepted and evaluated by the USF Office of Admissions. Physical Education and military science credits do not count toward the Associate in Arts Certificate. All students must satisfy the General Education Requirements of USF and must satisfy the requirements listed in Florida Statutes Section 1007.25 and in State Board of Education Rule 6A-10.030, prior to receiving an Associate in Arts Certificate. 2. Beginning with students initially entering a Florida College System institution or State University System institution in 2014-2015 and thereafter, coursework for an Associate in Arts degree shall include demonstration in competency in a foreign language pursuant to Florida Statute 1007.262 (Also known as USF's FLENT requirement). 3. In order to receive an Associate in Arts Certificate, students must submit a graduation application prior to the application deadline. The deadline to apply for a certificate in each semester is stated in the Academic Calendar in the catalog. The graduation application is available online in OASIS. 4. The Associate in Arts Certificate must be awarded prior to the term that the student becomes eligible for the baccalaureate degree. 5. Final processing for the Associate in Arts will be done after grades are processed at the end of the semester for which the student applied. All work, including transfer work, taken in that semester will be evaluated with respect to the requirements for the Associate in Arts Certificate. 6. Any incomplete grades shown on the permanent record of an Associate in Arts applicant at the time grades are processed will be treated as an \"F\" in the calculation of grade point average. Transfer students who completed a substantial portion of the Associate in Arts degree requirements at another institution in the Florida College System will be encouraged to notify that institution of the additional USF credits that may be transferred to that institution towards conferral of that degree. If the former institution will not confer the Associate in Arts degree with the addition of USF transfer credits, but is eligible for the Associate in Arts certificate at USF, then the USF institution will confer the Associate in Arts certificate. 7. The General Education Requirements will be based on the approved University policy in effect in the catalog year the student chooses according to the University policy regarding the choice of catalog. The consideration of whether or not General Education Requirements are met will be made without consideration of the student's choice of major at the time he/she applies. 8. University of South Florida credit hours will be broadly defined to include USF sponsored student exchange programs and the University of Florida Correspondence Division. The grades from these institutions, (except those earned through the University of Florida Correspondence Division) are recorded on the permanent record at USF, and included in the grade point average calculation, and will be counted in the student's grade point average as work attempted at USF for the Associate in Arts Certificate. 9. An applicant who has not been enrolled at USF for three (3) semesters may be contacted to ascertain whether or not that applicant meets the residency requirements. 10. In approving any application for the Associate in Arts Certificate, satisfactory/unsatisfactory grades will be accepted according to the approved University policy in effect during the terms of the student's enrollment without regard for the student's declared major. Students must be aware that if they have taken any courses on 120 a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis where such grades are not acceptable by the college of the major, the students may be required to repeat particular courses for a traditional letter grade or take additional courses for a traditional letter grade to meet the college requirements. 11. All University of South Florida colleges with undergraduate programs will accept the Associate in Arts from USF. That is, the student will be placed, at least, at the junior level and will be considered to have met the University's General Education Requirements. The applicability of the courses taken by the student toward his/her major program will be determined by the college of the student's major. Similarly, any special requirements for a student's professional certification (e.g., Education and Engineering) are not necessarily met by the Associate in Arts Certificate, but could be included as part of the General Education Requirements. Thus, students should check with their colleges concerning meeting any special requirements in an efficient manner. 12. The awarding of the Associate in Arts Certificate is posted on the permanent record but does not alter the calculation of the grade point average nor does it interrupt the accumulation of the student's record. 13. Students who follow a baccalaureate degree program as recommended by a college will not necessarily be eligible for the Associate in Arts Certificate prior to the completion of ninety (90) credit hours. Specific Authority 1001.74, 1001.75, 1007.25, FS., Art. IX, Fla. Constitution and Resolutions issued by the FL Board of Governors. Law Implemented 1007.23, 1007.25 FS. History - New (BOT approval) (technical). Change of USF Institution The University of South Florida System consists of three separately accredited institutions - USF Tampa, USF St. Petersburg, and USF Sarasota-Manatee. Each Institution has unique policies as well as unique degree and residency requirements. To help ensure that students are on track to graduate and are less likely to have excess credit hours, students are required to apply if they choose to change their USF home institution. Procedures may be found by visiting ugs.usf.edu/system/change-of-institution. The request to change institutions must be signed off by the student and approved by the incoming USF institution. All first time in college students (FTIC) students must have completed at least three consecutive semesters, not including summer (i.e., fall, spring, fall), at their current institution before change of institution requests will be processed. Credit by Examination A student who feels they have already acquired the basic content of a course on their approved schedule should inquire about credit-by-examination. Some exams are offered through the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) and others may be offered within colleges. Interested students should obtain additional information from their advisors or Testing Services. 121 Credit earned through one examination program may not be duplicated by another examination or course. The following limitations should be recognized: 1. CLEP credit will not satisfy USFSM's residency requirement. 2. Credit for the General Natural Science examination will be granted for non-majors only. Certain General and Subject CLEP Examinations may be found at http://www.uc.usf.edu/testing/ and may apply to the General Education Requirements. Some programs do not award credit toward the degree for certain CLEP examinations, and certain graduate or professional schools such as law, medicine and engineering may not grant equal recognition to students with extensive examination credits. An academic advisor should be consulted to ascertain the applicability of a specific CLEP examination toward a student's degree requirements and the advisability of taking the examinations in a student's specific situation. Students may also refer to collegeboard.org as a source of additional CLEP information. USF System Policy 10-017 Credit by Examination I. INTRODUCTION (Purpose and Intent) In order to provide greater flexibility and opportunity for students to shorten the time required to obtain a baccalaureate degree, the University of South Florida System (USF System) grants credit-by-examination equivalencies for the following acceleration mechanisms: Advanced Placement (AP), Advanced International Certificate of Education Program (AICE), International Baccalaureate (IB), College-Level Examination Program (CLEP), DANTES/DSST and Excelsior College exams. II. STATEMENT OF POLICY The University of South Florida System awards credit-by-examination based on the minimum guidelines as established by the Articulation Coordinating Committee (ACC) available on the flvc.org website, pursuant to Florida Statute 1007.27(2), and approved by the State Board of Education and Board of Governors. Effective fall 2009, a maximum of 45 credit hours in any combination of the examinations provided by the Advanced Placement (AP), Advanced International Certificate of Education Program (AICE), International Baccalaureate (IB), College-Level Examination Program (CLEP), DANTES/DSST and Excelsior College exams will be accepted by the USF System. Course equivalencies for credit-by-exam are posted on the Undergraduate Studies website. Students who enter the USF System with more than 45 credit hours of examinations completed will work with an appropriate academic advisor to determine the most advantageous selection of the credits to be applied. Any requests for an exception to the 45 hour rule must be submitted to the Dean of Undergraduate Studies within thirty (30) days of first attendance. Credit earned through these examination programs also applies toward satisfaction of the nine (9) credit hour Summer Attendance Requirement but only if the student enters the USF System with nine (9) or more credit hours from all acceleration programs combined (i.e. the listed examination programs plus Dual Credit). The University of South Florida System will accept credit-by-examination included on transcripts from all accredited colleges, provided the scores earned are at or above the minimums as stated by the ACC. Regional campuses and separately accredited institutions may have unique characteristics. Students, faculty and staff must check with their individual campuses and apply policies in conjunction and consistent with the specific characteristics, guidelines or procedures applicable to those campuses. 122 Dean's List & Regional Chancellor's List Full-time undergraduate students who demonstrate superior academic achievement during one (1) semester will be honored on a \"Dean's List\" or \"Regional Chancellor's List.\" To be eligible for this recognition, a student must complete at least twelve (12) hours of USF System courses in a given semester. The hours must be graded (A-F) with no incomplete grades, S/U grades, missing grades, or withdrawals during the semester. The Dean's List shall consist of students with a USF System term GPA of 3.90 or above. The Regional Chancellor's List shall consist of students with a USF System term GPA of 4.00. The college dean in which the student is majoring will recognize the academic honor. Students who receive the honor will have it posted to their official transcript. Students registered in the Office of Students with Disabilities Services whose approved accommodations include a reduced academic load are eligible by meeting the above parameters with at least nine (9) hours of graded USFSM courses completed in the semester and the recommendation from that office, to be confirmed by the College Dean. Declaration of Major It is advantageous for students to make early decisions about their majors to be on-track toward their degrees and to graduate in a timely manner. Students are urged to declare a major upon entry to the university. If they are unable to formally choose or declare a major or a pre-major, they should meet with an academic advisor or career counselor to determine a program that best matches their interests. FTIC (First Time In College) students must be officially declared in a major or a pre-major before they register for more than 36 credits, including credit earned via Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or Dual Enrollment coursework. Students will not be allowed to register for further credit coursework at USFSM until they have declared a major or pre-major. Transfer students should declare their majors upon entry to USFSM. Transfer students who have not declared a major (or pre-major) and who have completed 75 or more credit hours of college coursework will not be allowed to register for further credit coursework at the university until they have declared a major or a pre-major. Students transferring in 75 or more credit hours will be required to declare a major (or pre-major) at the time of admission. Many resources are made available by the university to assist students in making career decisions and choosing their majors. Information about these resources is readily available from academic advisors or the Career Center. Change of Major All students desiring to change their major should consult the Advising Office in SMC-C107. 123 Degree Progression USF System Policy 10-505 Undergraduates must complete the Online Graduation Application and the Online Graduating Senior Survey by the official University deadline for the term in which they expect to graduate. Degree application deadlines are available in the Academic Calendar. Students who have completed all the requirements for their degree will be required to graduate. Exceptions may be approved by college deans or their designees for up to two additional semesters but not to exceed 10 semesters total to complete a degree (eight semesters for the major and two additional semesters) to allow students to complete approved second majors or to complete clearly defined objectives to enhance qualifications for employment or graduate and professional programs. Exceptions may be made for part-time students. Unless undergraduate students receive approval from the Assistant Vice President for Student Success of an exception to the graduation request, USFSM may move the student through to graduation and confer the degree earned. Students should be approved to pursue minors only if the minor can be completed without extending the time required for the students' initially projected graduation date and without exceeding their Excess Credit Hour Surcharge (ECHS) threshold. Students in programs without available elective hours will not be approved for minors, unless an exception is approved by the College Dean or designee. Students are expected to demonstrate academic success (appropriate GPA for program, completion ratio, and success in prerequisites, core, or other related coursework for current major and requested minor) before they can be approved for a minor. Students will apply for a minor in the last term of enrollment provided the student will have completed all of the remaining course requirements for the minor in that term. Students may be approved to pursue dual degrees and second majors only if they are able to complete both programs within no more than two additional semesters but not to exceed 10 semesters total to complete a degree from the initially projected graduation date or within the ECHS threshold for dual majors or dual degrees. Second majors are awarded only in conjunction with the receipt of a baccalaureate degree. Students are expected to apply for a second major or degree only after demonstrating academic success (appropriate GPA for both major programs, completion ration, and success in prerequisites, core or other related coursework for current major and second major or degree). Students will typically be approved for a second major or dual degrees before exceeding 96 credit hours (not counting in the latter any credit from examination or dual enrollment). The students' program of study is delineated on the application form and must be reviewed by both program advisors prior to submission for approval. Third majors will only be allowed in exceptional circumstances when the student can complete within the above criteria. No degree will be conferred if a charge of academic dishonesty or student conduct violation is pending and the penalty could be dismissal, expulsion, failing grade or any combination of the above, until the charge is resolved and degree requirements are met. As per USF System Regulation USF3.007 successful completion of at least 25% of the total credit hours required for the degree must be in courses offered by the USF System Institution conferring the degree. Students are expected to graduate within the minimum number of semesters appropriate to their academic work completed at the time of their admission and the extent to which they are able to be enrolled full-time. 124 Double Majors and Dual Degrees Double Undergraduate Major Students may elect to graduate with two majors. In that event, they must apply independently to each college and be assigned an advisor in each discipline. The student must meet all requirements of each major separately. Both majors must reside at USFSM. In declaring a second major, the student will be charged the Excess Credit Hour Surcharge required by the state for excess credit hours beyond the official limit (after 110-120 percent of those allowed for the first major, up to thirty credit hours allowed for the second major). Both majors will be awarded in the same term at the completion of the degree. The student will not receive two degrees. Second Undergraduate Major A student who wishes to work toward a second major, after receipt of a baccalaureate degree, must apply as a degree-seeking student through the Office of Admissions (if they are inactive) and meet the major requirements as determined by the college. (Exceptions to this rule are students who have been previously accepted for a \"Double Undergraduate Major\" but graduated with only one major.) Students pursuing a second undergraduate major must submit the Post-Baccalaureate Major/Minor Application to their academic advisor within the first twenty (20) class days of the term they expect to complete their second undergraduate major coursework. Upon proof of completion, the student's \"permanent academic record\" will be posted accordingly.* *Note that those students who complete the requirements for a second major must be aware that they will not receive a second degree. Two Baccalaureate Degrees A student at USF may receive two baccalaureate degrees provided he/she meets University graduation requirements for both degrees. In addition to the minimum 120 semester credit hours that apply toward the first degree, the student must also earn at least a minimum of 30 semester credit hours in USF undergraduate courses that will apply toward the second degree. The student must also meet the requirements of the college awarding the degree and the residency requirement. In declaring a second degree, the student will be charged the Excess Credit Hour Surcharge required by the state for excess credit hours beyond the official limit (after 110-120 percent of those allowed for the first degree, plus thirty credit hours for the second degree). Both degrees will be awarded in the same term at the completion of the degrees. 125 Drops/Withdrawals A student may drop a course(s) during the drop/add periods (first five days of classes) and no entry of the course(s) will appear on any permanent academic records. No tuition or fees will be assessed for course(s) dropped within that period. Students may also withdraw from courses between the second and tenth week of the semester, except for summer sessions. All applicable registration fees must be paid for the course(s) and a \"W\" grade will reflect on the permanent academic record. Students who withdraw may not continue attending class. Withdrawal deadlines for summer sessions are listed in the Academic Calendar and are published in the USF System Schedule of Classes for summer terms. Appeals for withdrawals after the tenth week of the semester must be made to the Academic Regulations Committee. Undergraduate students are limited to a total of five (5) course withdrawals while enrolled as a degree-seeking or non-degree seeking student at USF System institutions. Course withdrawals are limited to three (3) courses for students with less than or equal to sixty (60) semester credit hours, and two (2) courses for students with more than 60 semester credit hours. Only in extenuating circumstances will approval be granted for more than five (5) course withdrawals. Appeals for additional course withdrawals due to extenuating circumstances must be submitted to the Academic Regulations Committee for review. Effective Fall 2016, all students will be limited to two (2) withdrawals from graduate courses while enrolled as degree-seeking or a non-degree seeking at USF. Requests for withdrawals from graduate level courses are submitted via the Withdrawal from Course Request form. Only in extenuating circumstances will approval be granted for more than two graduate course withdrawals. Appeals for additional graduate course withdrawals due to extenuating circumstances must be submitted via the Graduate Petition Form. Under specific conditions, consideration for refund of tuition and fees may be requested if a Fee Adjustment Request form accompanied by verifiable supporting documentation is submitted to the Office of the Registrar at USF Tampa within six (6) months from the end of the semester to which any refund would be applicable. Foreign Language Requirement Policy All students pursuing a B.A. degree must satisfy the college-level foreign language requirement, which in Florida is met through satisfactory completion (C or better) of a second-level language course. USFSM accepts many languages to fill this requirement; students seeking to have credit accepted or to demonstrate competency for exemption, should discuss this with their academic advisor. At USFSM, students can meet the foreign language requirement through the study of two (2) languages: Spanish Course Sequence (accepted in all degree programs) SPN 1120 Beginning Spanish I (4 credits) - for those with no previous Spanish language experience SPN 1110 Introductory Spanish for High Beginners (3 credits) - an alternative to SPN 1120 SPN 1121 Beginning Spanish II (4 credits) - must be completed or exempted 126 American Sign Language Course Sequence (accepted in some degree programs) ASL 2140C Basic American Sign Language I (4 credits) ASL 2150C Intermediate American Sign Language (4 credits) Spanish Language Placement In Spanish, it is possible to exempt one or both courses through a placement test. The placement test assesses the student's skills level to indicate the appropriate class for the student to enter. By taking the placement test, students can avoid spending time, effort, and money on unnecessary classes. Students must take the placement test If they have taken one (1) or more years of high-school Spanish, If the test indicates that one's skills level is equal to accomplishment of SPN 1120, one may exempt that course and enter SPN 1121. If the test indicates that one's skills level is below the accomplishment of SPN 1120, one may take SPN 1110 (3 credits) to raise one's competency to what will be needed to enter SPN 1121. Or one may elect to take SPN 1120 (4 credits), but if one elects this option, one will earn only an S/U grade. Students may take the placement test If they grew up speaking Spanish with family and friends o Depending on one's assessed skills level, one may exempt none, one, or both courses. If they took SPN 1120 at USF more than two terms previously o If the test indicates that one's skills level is below the accomplishment of SPN 1120, one may retake SPN 1120 if qualified for \"grade forgiveness\" o Or one may pay to audit SPN 1120 or SPN 1110 as space allows. If they took college Spanish elsewhere. o If the test indicates that one's skills level is below the accomplishment of SPN 1120, one may pay to audit SPN 1120 or SPN 1110 as space allows. Spanish Language Competency Levels The USFSM Spanish language placement test identifies four levels of language competency, based on the National Proficiency Guidelines of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL, 2012). Competency Description Placement Novice-Low A Novice-Low learner of a foreign language is only able to use an extremely limited vocabulary, often inadequately. These learners are unable to provide any type of significant information in the target language, as their use of it is often repetitive and incorrect. There is a prevalent use of invented words among these learners. A student whose performance on the placement test is rated as \"Novice-Low\" will be placed in SPN 1120. 127 They are totally unable to produce complete sentences or even coherent phrases in the target language, and are often not understood by a sympathetic listener Novice-Mid A Novice-Mid learner of a foreign language is able to use a limited number of words and phrases for common objects or actions and to provide basic information. Vocabulary is repetitive, and the learner constantly uses memorized words, lists and phrases. Their use of complete sentences is very occasional, and accuracy tends to decrease when the student communicates beyond the word or memorized phrase level. These learners can be understood, albeit with considerable level of difficultly, by a sympathetic listener. A student whose performance on the placement test is rated as \"Novice-Mid\" will be placed in SPN 1110. Novice High A Novice-High learner of a foreign language is able, among other things, to use familiar words and phrases on familiar tasks, topics, and activities, apart from elaborating a little with the target language, mainly in the present tense. Normally, this learner will communicate in short, simple sentences. The learner should be able to engage in some creation with the target language through recombination of memorized words and phrases. Breakdown is expected as the learner is asked to engage in more complex conversation or written production. These learners can be understood, albeit with some level of difficultly, by a sympathetic listener. A student whose performance on the placement test is rated as \"Novice-High\" will be placed in SPN 1121. Intermediate-Low An Intermediate-Low learner of a foreign language is able to use that language successfully in a limited number of uncomplicated social situations. These situations normally include exchanges about general personal information, daily routine, personal preferences and urgent needs (for example, getting directions, ordering food, asking for help, etc.). This learner is capable of creating with the target language by recombining what he or she knows and what he or she hears from their interlocutors. This learner is able to produce short statements, discrete sentences and to ask a limited number of questions, mostly in the present tense. An Intermediate-Low learner will be generally understood by a native speaker of the language, although misunderstandings will be frequent. 128 Grades, Scholarship Requirements, and Review Procedures USFSM is interested in each student making reasonable progress towards his/her educational goals and will aid each student through guidance and advising. To make students aware of their academic progress, the University has enacted a system of grading and policies of Academic Probation and Academic Dismissal that indicates whether or not a student is showing sufficient progress toward meeting degree requirements. Notations of Grades, Academic Probation, and Academic Dismissal are posted to the student's academic record. When a student is academically dismissed from the University and is ineligible to re-enroll, it may be in his/her best interest to re-evaluate educational goals with a college academic advisor. If poor academic performance has resulted from extenuating circumstances, or significant time has elapsed and the student has gained adequate maturity and motivation, a petition to the Academic Regulations Committee can be submitted for permission to re-enroll. See \"Academic Regulations Committee\" for information on petitioning. Grade Forgiveness Policy USFSM's grade forgiveness policy permits an undergraduate to repeat a course and have the repeated grade computed in his/her GPA in place of the original grade, providing the repeat grade is posted as \"D-\" or higher (exception - see Honors at Graduation) and is higher than the first grade. Normally, grade forgiveness may only be applied to a specific course that a student chooses to repeat. No course taken on the S/U grade basis may have the grade forgiveness applied. Under unusual circumstances, a different but similar course may be used if the substitute course has been previously approved by the college dean and is on file in the Office of the Registrar. The grade forgiveness policy cannot apply to any course in which the grade of \"FF\" has been recorded. Any undergraduate or non-degree-seeking student who wishes to implement grade forgiveness must: 1. Complete a \"Grade Forgiveness Request Form\" (available on the Office of the Registrar's website) for each course to be repeated. It is recommended that the student meet with his/her academic advisor to determine if a grade forgiveness is appropriate. 2. Adhere to the following conditions: 1. A limitation of applying grade forgiveness to three USF System courses with no more than one repeat per course. 2. With prior approval of the college dean, a course different from a course on the approved list may be substituted in the following cases: 1. The substitute course is a change in prefix, number, hours, or title, but not a substantive change in content from the original course. 2. The substitute course replaces a course no longer offered by the institution. 3. The repeated course must be taken under the standard grading system (A - F) and the latest grade must be posted as \"D-\" or higher (grades of S/U are not permitted) and be higher than the first grade. 4. All grades remain on the transcript. The original course grade will be annotated with \"E\" to indicate that the course has subsequently been repeated and the original grade is not computed in the GPA. 5. Individual colleges may have further restrictions; therefore, the student should consult with his/her college. 129 6. This policy is applicable to undergraduate and non-degree-seeking students only, and applies to 1000-to-5000-level courses. Once students have been awarded a bachelor's degree from USFSM, they may not repeat a course and be forgiven the original grade, taken prior to graduation. 7. The policy applies only to courses taken originally at USF System and repeated at USF System. Grading System Effective Fall semester 2000, a plus/minus grading system was implemented with the corresponding quality points. The use of the plus/minus grading system is at the discretion of the individual faculty member. A student's measure of academic achievement is recorded on the academic record based on the following grading system: Plus/minus Grades A+ 4.00 A Excellent Performance 4.00 B+ 3.33 B Good Performance 3.00 B- C Average Performance 2.00 C- 1.67 D Poor Performance 1.00 D- 0.67 F 0.00 Other Grades E Course repeated, not included in GPA CF Cancelled financially, course was cancelled due to financial reasons CMU Cancelled, missing grade that has turned to a \"U\" FF Failure/academic dishonesty I Incomplete IA Incomplete, grade points not applicable IB Incomplete, grade points not applicable IC Incomplete, grade points not applicable ID Incomplete, grade points not applicable IF Incomplete grade changed to Failure IU Incomplete grade changed to Unsatisfactory M Missing grade/No grade submitted by instructor, grade points not applicable N Audit, grade points not applicable 130 R Repeated Course S Satisfactory, grade points not applicable U Unsatisfactory, grade points not applicable W Withdrawal from course without penalty WC Withdrawal for extenuating circumstances Z Indicates continuing registration Grade Point Average USFSM grade-point average (GPA) is computed by dividing the total number of quality points (see grading system section) by the total hours attempted at institutions in the USF System. The total quality points are figured by multiplying the number of credits assigned to each course by the quality point value of the grade given. Credit hours for courses with grades of \"I\", \"IU\", \"M\", \"N\", \"S\", \"U\", are preceded by an \"E\" are subtracted from the total hours attempted before the GPA is calculated. Credit hours for repeated USF System coursework will be awarded only once per course unless the course is a university-approved repeatable course. \"D\" and \"F\" grades, however, for repeated USF System coursework will be counted in the computation of the student's GPA as many times as those grades for that course are recorded. If a student originally earns a \"C\" or higher in a course that may not be repeated for additional credit and earns a \"C\" or higher on a subsequent enrollment, the new grade is not computed in the USF System GPA unless the forgiveness policy is being applied. \"I\" Grade Policy An \"I\" grade indicates incomplete coursework and may be awarded to graduate and undergraduate students. (Undergraduate rules apply to non-degree-seeking students.) It may be awarded to an undergraduate student only when a small portion of the student's work is incomplete and only when the student is otherwise earning a passing grade. Until removed, the \"I\" is not computed in the GPA for either undergraduate or graduate students. The time limit for removing the \"I\" is to be set by the instructor of the course. For undergraduate students, this time limit may not exceed two academic semesters, whether or not the student is in residence, and/or graduation, whichever comes first. \"I\" grades not removed by the end of the time limit will be changed to \"IF\" or \"IU,\" whichever is appropriate. If an instructor is willing, he or she may accept work from a student after an \"I\" grade has changed to an IF or IU grade, and assign the student a final grade in the course, unless the student has graduated. Whether or not the student is in residence, any change to \"IF\" grades will be calculated in the cumulative GPA and, if applicable; the student will be placed on appropriate probation or academically dismissed. Students are not required to re-register for courses in which they are only completing previous course requirements to change an \"I\" grade. However, if a student wants to audit a course for review in order to complete course requirements, full fees must be paid. \"M\" Grade Policy An \"M\" grade is automatically assigned as a default grade when the instructor does not submit a grade for a student. (Undergraduate rules also apply to non-degree-seeking students.) Unless a change of grade is submitted, the \"M\" grade will remain on the transcript and will not be computed in the student's GPA. 131 S/U Grade System Course with No-Option Certain courses have been designated as S/U courses. The \"S\" and \"U\" grades are used to indicate the student's final grade. These S/U only courses are identified with (S/U only) after the course definition in this catalog. No grading system option is available to students or faculty in these courses. Courses with Option The following restrictions may apply to any undergraduate course taken on an S/U basis by a student: 1. Required courses in the major may not be taken on an S/U basis. 2. Specifically designated required courses in the distribution requirements of the student's college may not be taken on an S/U basis. 3. Courses to satisfy the Writing (Communication) and Mathematics (Computation) Requirements, formerly known as Gordon Rule, may not be taken on an S/U basis. 4. Courses to satisfy General Education may not be taken on an S/U basis. 5. Courses to satisfy USF's B.A. foreign language requirement may not be taken on an S/U basis. 6. All elective courses for the major and all elective courses in the distribution requirements and all other free elective courses may be taken on an S/U basis except where: 1. The certifying college restricts the number of courses that may be taken on an S/U basis in any one or all of the above areas or restricts the total number of S/U courses that can be accepted for all of the above areas. 2. The certifying college specifies that certain courses may not be taken on an S/U basis. 3. The instructor of a course refuses to allow the course to be taken on an S/U basis. Mechanism for Assigning S/U Grades The method by which a student receives an \"S\" or \"U\" grade in an option course will consist of the following: 1. A written agreement signed by both instructor and student shall be filed with the USFSM Office of Records and Registration as may be designated by the college. The college shall set the deadline (no later than the last day of classes for the term) for the student to decide if he/she wishes to take the course on an S/U basis. 2. The instructor shall assign final letter grades \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"F\", or \"I\", but will transmit the Registrar \"S\" or \"U\" consistent with the following: 1. Letter grade, \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", or \"C-\" shall be equivalent to a letter grade of \"S.\" 2. Letter grades \"D\" or \"F\" shall be equivalent to a letter grade of \"U.\" 3. \"S\" and \"U\" grades are not computed in the student's GPA. 132 Graduation Application In order to graduate, a student must submit a graduation application for the bachelor's degree. The graduation application for the bachelor's degree is available online in OASIS. Inquiries concerning approval or denial of graduation should be made to the appropriate academic advisor. This application must be submitted in the term of expected graduation by the deadline noted in the academic calendar. This allows time for ordering academic regalia for participation in the graduation ceremony, certification of graduation by the end of the term, inclusion of name in the graduation bulletin, and timely ordering of the diploma. Students who submit the graduation application after the posted deadline but prior to the last day of classes for the academic term, and who are determined to have met all graduation requirements in that semester, may have their graduation posted that term. Late student applications may not be processed before the next term's registration period if they have not met all degree requirements. Applications received after the last day of classes will result in the graduation being posted at the end of the following academic term. If a student applies for graduation and is not approved, a new application for degree must be submitted by the deadline in a new term. In order for the degree statement to appear on a student's academic record, the student must file the aforementioned application whether or not participation in the commencement ceremony is desired. It is the student's responsibility to clear all \"I\" grades (in-completes) in courses required for graduation and to provide official transcripts of all transferred coursework needed for graduation at least three (3) weeks prior to the end of the term in which he/she expects to graduate. A student applying for a second undergraduate major must do so within the same deadline set for applying for a degree. Students applying for a minor must complete the following: 1. Apply for the minor online in OASIS; listing both the minor and the college responsible for the minor on the application; and 2. Have no \"I\" grade in required courses. For purposes of honors recognition at the ceremony, students must have a 3.50 GPA before the term in which they plan to graduate to have honors recognized publicly at the commencement ceremony. Although applications will be accepted until the last day of classes for the semester of graduation, students applying late will jeopardize their chances of having met all requirements and be denied graduation as a result. 133 Graduation Requirements In addition to the USF System requirements, USFSM minimum requirements for graduation consists of completion of the Core Curriculum. USF System Regulation USF 3.00 Degree Requirements: Baccalaureate/Undergraduate A student is academically eligible to receive a Baccalaureate degree from individual institutions in the University of South Florida System (USF System) when a student completes the requirements of entities including (1) the Board of Governors (BOG), (2) the USF System, (3) the Program, College or Institution requirements, and (4) general academic approval by the University. The requirements are outlined in more detail below. (1) Board of Governors Basic Requirements: (established by Florida state law and the Board of Governors Regulation 6.017, 8.005 and 8.006.) (a) Satisfactory completion of general education requirements consisting of a minimum of: 1. Thirty-six (36) semester hours in the subject areas of communication, mathematics, social sciences, humanities, and natural sciences, including: a. Six (6) semester hours of English coursework (formerly known as Gordon Rule courses) in which the student is required to demonstrate college level writing skills through multiple assignments and six (6) additional semester hours of coursework with similar writing requirements. Students awarded college credit in English based on their demonstration of writing skills through dual enrollment, advanced placement, or international baccalaureate instruction shall be considered to have satisfied this requirement to the extent of the college credit awarded. b. Six (6) semester hours of mathematics coursework (formerly known as Gordon Rule courses) at the level of college algebra or higher. Applied logic, statistics and other computation-based coursework that may not be offered by a mathematics department may be used to fulfill three (3) of the six (6) hours required by this section. Students awarded college credit based on their demonstration of mathematics skills at the level of college algebra or higher through dual enrollment, advanced placement, or international baccalaureate instruction shall be considered to have satisfied this requirement to the extent of the college credit awarded. c. For students entering the University as a first-time-in-college student beginning Fall term 2015, at least one (1) course from each of the general education subject areas listed below in this section. These courses comprise the general education core as required per section 1007.25(3), Florida Statutes. 1. One of the following courses in Communication: ENC X101 English Composition I; orA course with an ENC prefix for which ENC X101 is a direct prerequisite. 2.

NOTE: Students who transfer into a state university or between state universities shall be required to meet the above general education core requirements if the students were classified as first-time-in-college at their original postsecondary institution Fall Term 2015 and thereafter. Any course accepted by an institution in the Florida College System or State University System as meeting the general education core at that institution shall be accepted as meeting the core requirements at all institutions. All credit earned by other transfer students shall be evaluated by the receiving institution on a course-by-course basis to determine core equivalency. Credit earned through an acceleration mechanism in Section 1007.27, Florida Statutes and Board of Governors Regulation 6.006, will meet the related general education core course requirement. (b) Civic Literacy Baccalaureate degree-seeking students initially entering a state university fall semester 2018 and thereafter must demonstrate competency in civic literacy through one of the following options prior to graduation: (1) Successfully passing either POSX041 American Government or AMHX020 Introductory Survey Since 1877. Each of the courses must include the following competencies: a.

The USF System must comply with any updates or changes to state mandates or BOG requirements. The USF System will incorporate those changes in this Regulation by technical amendment as quickly as possible. However, at all times, including what may be an interim processing time, students will be held to the most current standards established by the BOG or state law. 135 (2) USF System Requirements. In addition to Florida Board of Governors and/or state requirements, the USF System has the following USF specific minimum requirements that are designed to assure the academic integrity of the degree programs at each System Institution: a. Successful completion of a minimum of 120 unduplicated semester credit hours through university coursework, acceleration mechanisms, and/or transfer credit, including courses specifically approved as repeatable for credit within the System (e.g. practica, ensembles and field experiences); b. A minimum adjusted grade point average (GPA) of 2.00 on all course work taken at the USF System Institution from which the degree is conferred and an overall 2.00 average on all college-level work attempted; c. Satisfactory completion of major requirements in a chosen degree program, including additional requirements set by the USF System Institution and college offering the degree; d. Successful completion of at least forty-two (42) semester hours in courses numbered 3000 and above; e. Successful completion of at least 25% of the total credit hours required for the degree must be in courses offered by the USF System Institution conferring the degree; f. Registration and successful completion of at least thirty (30) of the last sixty (60) semester hours at the USF System Institution (home institution) from which the degree is to be conferred. In cases of emergency, a maximum of six (6) hours of the final thirty (30) semester hours may be completed by correspondence or residence at another accredited senior institution with the approval of the academic dean. Exceptions to the home institution rules in this paragraph may be made for students who are enrolled at other universities in USF-approved exchanges, study abroad programs, co-op training programs or correspondence courses from the University of Florida. CLEP credit does not count toward academic residence; g. Beginning fall semester 2012, students must complete successfully at least 50% of the required courses in the major in courses offered by the USF System Institution conferring the degree. In cases of hardship or lack of course availability, individual exceptions may be approved by the respective College Deans or designees to help ensure timely graduation; h. To help ensure that students are on track to graduate and are less likely to have excess credit hours, students are required to apply to change USF institutions (USF, USFSM, USFSP) and follow the appropriate procedures. All FTIC students must have completed at least three consecutive semesters, not including summer (i.e., Fall, Spring, Fall), at their current institution before change of institution requests will be processed. The request to change institutions must be signed off by the student and approved by the incoming USF institution. i. Students who have entered a university in the State of Florida University System with fewer than sixty (60) hours of credit are required to earn at least nine (9) hours prior to graduation by attendance in one or more summer terms in courses offered by a USF System Institution or any one of the State University System of Florida institutions. This requirement may be waived in cases of unusual hardship to the individual; j. Satisfaction of the foreign-language admissions requirement by having two (2) sequential units of the same foreign language in high school, or eight (8) semester hours of the same foreign language in college, or documented equivalent proficiency; and k. The student's degree program (major) will appear on the baccalaureate diploma. (If a student satisfies all requirements for two (2) majors, including admission, prerequisite, core, etc., both majors may appear on the diploma). (3) Program, College, or Institutional Requirements: All students must be aware of and satisfactorily complete any additional requirements that may be required by a specific program, college or institution from which they are graduating as set forth in handbook, catalog, or other published criteria. (4) General Academic Approval: Successful completion of academic coursework constituting the student's program of studies, minor, honors thesis, or certification examination does not guarantee award of the baccalaureate degree. Faculty judgment of the academic performance of the student is inherent in the educational process in determining whether the award of the baccalaureate degree or admission into a higher level degree program is warranted. 136 Authority: Art. IX, Sec. 7, Fla. Constitution; Fla. Board of Governors Regulations 1.001, 6.016, 6.017; 1007.25, F.S. History - 2-22-16 (technical). Honors at Graduation To be considered for honors at graduation, a baccalaureate candidate must have completed at least forty (40) credits of graded upper-level work within the USF system institutions. In addition, a student must have earned a grade point average of 3.50 or higher for all graded coursework attempted within the USF System Institutions, and 3.50 GPA in all post-secondary coursework. For those students in programs requiring multiple clinical experiences (such as Education), a baccalaureate candidate must have completed at least thirty (30) hours of graded upper level coursework and have earned a grade point average of 3.5 or higher for all graded coursework attempted within the USF System Institution. In addition, to be eligible for honors, all students who have post-secondary work elsewhere must have an overall GPA of 3.50 or higher counting all courses within the USF System institution as well as all transferable work attempted at other institutions. The grade forgiveness policy within the USF System or other institutions and plus/minus grades awarded at other institutions will not be applicable in computing the GPA for honors. In addition, students with a record of academic dishonesty appearing on any transcripts may graduate from a degree program after meeting all degree requirements, but will not be eligible for honors at graduation, including the honor of graduating from the Honors College or a college honors program.Criteria for Honors at Graduation: Cum Laude (with honor): 3.50 USF System GPA or higher AND 3.50 - 3.69 overall GPA Magna Cum Laude (with high honor): 3.50 USF System GPA or higher AND 3.70-3.89 overall GPA Summa Cum Laude (with highest honor): 3.50 USF System GPA or higher AND 3.90 overall GPA or higher In addition, each college dean has the option to select on the basis of exceptional achievement 1% of the college's graduates or 1 student per semester for graduating with distinction. For purposes of honors recognition at the commencement ceremony, students must have a 3.50 GPA before the term in which they plan to graduate to have honors recognized publicly at the commencement ceremony. NOTE: The GPA is not rounded up when determining honors at graduation (e.g., 3.69 is not the same as 3.70). The forgiveness policy at USF and other institutions and plus/minus grades awarded at other institutions will not be applicable in computing the GPA for honors. In addition, students with a record of academic dishonesty appearing on any transcript(s) will not be eligible for honors at graduation. 137 Independent Study Undergraduate students wishing to take a course by independent study must contact their academic advisor and the instructor of the course for permission. The instructor specifies the requirements to be completed by the student including tests, periodic class attendance, term papers, etc. Not all courses in USFSM may be taken by independent study. The respective colleges have jurisdiction in the determination of which courses may be taken in this manner. The regular grading system applies to all independent study students. Grades earned by independent study have the same status as those acquired through regular class attendance. Students taking a course by independent study must register for the specific course section in the regular manner. Mandatory Course Attendance at First Class Meeting This policy has been put into effect so that USFSM may effectively utilize classroom space and to ensure that all students have maximum opportunity to enroll in classes where demand exceeds availability of seats. Students are required to attend the first class meeting of undergraduate courses for which they registered prior to the first day of the term. Names of students who register prior to the first day of the term are shown on the first class roll in Canvas for each course section. The first day class roll is used by professors to drop students who do not attend the first day of class. Students having extenuating circumstances beyond their control and who are unable to attend the first class meeting must notify the instructor or the college prior to the first class meeting to request waiver of the first class attendance requirement. Please note that the Registrar's Office does not add students to any courses. Students are required to add their courses via OASIS. To avoid fee liability and academic penalty, the student is responsible for ensuring that they have dropped or been dropped from all undesired courses by the end of the 5th day of classes. Refer to USF System Policy 10-006. Mid-Term Grades Posting USF System Policy 10-504 I. PURPOSE & INTENT The University of South Florida System (USF System) is committed to providing the necessary information to enable students to manage their academic progress. This Policy is one of many university initiatives directed at assisting students in effectively meeting their academic goals. 138 II. STATEMENT OF POLICY It is the student's sole responsibility to be aware of their academic standing and grade status in all courses. In an attempt to assist the student in evaluating his academic status mid-term, the University requires Instructors to submit midterm grades electronically for each student enrolled in 1000, 2000 and 3000 level courses. Instructors may choose to not report mid-term grades for alternate calendar courses, study abroad, directed studies, internships and other courses that do not follow the normal course schedule for the academic term, although they are encouraged to do so if appropriate. This is a courtesy to the student and failure of an instructor to post the mid-term grades will not be grounds for a student academic grievance nor will it be justification for a retroactive drop as the student is presumed to be aware of current academic status. III. PROCESS STEPS The Midterm Grade Reports are submitted after Week 7 or, for summer courses, soon after the midpoint of the time period that the course is conducted. The purpose of the Midterm Grade Report is to provide students in 1000, 2000 and 3000 level courses with information on whether they are making sufficient progress toward meeting the course requirements. This information is available to students in OASIS as a progress report for all students in Lower Level and early Upper Level courses. This Early Warning System provides midterm grade information that assists students and their advisors in determining if academic progress is sufficient in the course at a time where the student may be permitted to drop the course (although beyond the drop/add period resulting in fee liability) and receive a \"W\" for the course. This is an academic action only and does not support any financial refund or adjustment and students will remain responsible for all applicable registration fees for the course(s). The academic action will permit a \"W\" grade to reflect on the student's permanent academic record. Students who drop may not continue attending class. Drop deadlines for each semester and summer sessions are listed in the Academic Calendar and are published in the USF Schedule of Classes. Repeat Coursework The credit hours for a course that has been repeated may be counted only once toward the minimum 120 semester credit hours (earned hours) required for graduation. All credit hours (except when grade forgiveness is applied) are calculated in the GPA. For information regarding fees for repeat course work, refer to the Repeat Course Surcharges section of the catalog. Second Baccalaureate Degree (USFSM Transfer Students) A student who has already graduated from an accredited four-year institution must earn a minimum of an additional thirty (30) semester hours of USFSM undergraduate courses to apply toward his/her second baccalaureate degree. Students must also meet the University's regular graduation requirements, as well as the requirements of the college awarding the degree and the residency requirements. 139 Summer Enrollment Requirement USF System Regulation USF3.007 Degree Requirements: Baccalaureate/Undergraduate All students entering USFSM with fewer than sixty (60) hours of credit are required to earn at least nine (9) hours prior to graduation by attendance in one or more summer terms in courses offered by a USF System Institution or any one of the Florida State University System institutions. The University may waive the application of this rule in cases of unusual hardship. A student who wishes to have the rule waived must complete a \"Request for Waiver of Mandatory Summer Enrollment Form\" available in the USFSM Office of the Records & Registration. After submission of the form to the Office of the Records & Registration, the student will be notified by email of the action taken. Total Withdrawal Students may withdraw from the USF System without academic penalty for the first ten (10) weeks of any term, except for summer sessions, due to extenuating circumstances (ex. documented illness, family death, etc.) To withdraw, a student must submit a completed ARC petition for total withdrawal. No entry is made on the academic record for withdrawals submitted during the regular drop/add period (first 5 days of classes). All subsequent withdrawals (through the tenth week of classes in the fall and spring semesters) are posted to the academic record with \"W\" grades assigned to the courses. Withdrawal deadlines for summer sessions are listed in the Academic Calendar and are published in the USF System Schedule of Classes for Summer Terms. Undergraduate students who withdraw while on final academic probation will be academically dismissed from the USF System. When a student is academically dismissed, approval of the ARC is required for reentry. 140 Graduate Policies & Regulations USF System Regulations The University of South Florida System regulations provide information, services, and tools for locating, commenting on, challenging, promoting, and evaluating all USF System regulations. Regional campuses and separately accredited institutions may have unique characteristics. Students, faculty, and staff must check with their individual campuses and apply system-wide regulations in conjunction and consistent with the specific characteristics and guidelines applicable to those campuses. Regulations are required for matters subject to the Florida Board of Governors regulation development procedure. USF System Policies All policies in the USF System are promulgated through the process established in USF System Policy 0-001: Issuance of Policies. The USF System is currently comprised of three institutions separately accredited by SACS (USF Tampa, USF Sarasota-Manatee, and USF St. Petersburg). Each of the separately accredited institutions may initiate policy consistent with USF System policies, established laws, regulations and governance requirements. Each policy issued in the USF System must follow the established format. In this section...

Once processed, the student's status will be changed from Graduate Degree Seeking to Non-Degree Seeking. A change to Non-Degree Seeking status could adversely impact financial aid. Dismissal cannot be retroactive. The effective date will be entered into the student's record by the USF System Office of the Registrar as the First Business Day after the end of the Semester, except in cases of academic dismissal due to academic dishonesty or disruption of academic process. Some of the reasons for academic dismissal include: Failure to successfully satisfy requirements to meet Conditional Admission by the deadline established by the program. Receiving an \"FF\" grade Failure to maintain \"good standing\" Failure to make satisfactory progress To be readmitted, the student will need to reapply for admission, meeting the admission criteria in place at the time. Graduate students who are assigned an \"FF\" grade will be academically dismissed from the University and will not be eligible to apply to a graduate program at any USF System Institution. Change of Graduate Degree Program Request A Change of Graduate Program Request will NOT be considered for graduate students in their first semester of study. Only a continuing graduate student enrolled for study in a particular program who wishes to change to another program at the same or lower level may complete the Change of Program Request Application. It is up to the discretion of the student's new program to determine if a Change of Program is appropriate and will be granted. Students may obtain the Change of Program Request Application on the USF Sarasota-Manatee website. This form must be signed both by the current program and the new program, after which it must be submitted to the college for approval. If approved by the college, the change of program form is then sent to Records and Registration for processing. NOTE: Some programs may require another application to be submitted because the Change of Program Request Form does not contain sufficient information for them to make a decision. Students should check with the College before completing any paperwork. Credit Transfer Students may, with the approval of their graduate degree program, transfer credits from any regionally accredited institution into their graduate degree program, as long as the majority of the credits are earned at the institution granting the degree. Credits obtained from USF System Institutions will be calculated into the GPA at USF Sarasota-Manatee and will be noted on the transcript as the grade earned. Credits from other regionally accredited universities are not calculated into the GPA at USF Sarasota-Manatee. Only credits with a grade of B or better may be transferred. Credit for coursework expires seven (7) years after receiving the credit. There is no time limitation for courses from a completed master's degree or professional degree applied toward a doctoral degree. 143 The graduate degree program / department will be responsible for evaluating, approving, and initiating the transfer as soon as possible at the time of admission. Note - Students taking courses at USF System Institutions other than their home USF institution should seek the approval of their graduate program director prior to taking the courses to ensure that the courses are eligible for transfer.

For USF and non-USF System specific course requirements in common across both degree programs may be waived with the substitution of other approved coursework at the discretion of the program. *a maximum of twelve (12) credits can be transferred to a degree regardless of the source(s) **Programs that wish to transfer credit from a completed doctoral program to a professional program must submit the proposal to the Graduate School for approval. 144 Academic Standards and Grades In Good Standing To be considered a student in good standing, graduate students must: Maintain an overall minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 (on a 4.00 scale) in all courses taken as a graduate student, and Maintain an overall minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 (on a 4.00 scale) in all courses taken in each of the student's degree-seeking programs. No grade of C- or below will be accepted toward a graduate degree. Students must meet the requirements to be in good standing to graduate. All \"I\" and \"M\" grades must be cleared for graduation to be certified. Students who fail to maintain good standing may be placed on probation or academically dismissed. Course Availability USF System Regulation USF3.017: Deletion of Courses from Catalogs and Common Course Designation and Numbering System USF Sarasota-Manatee does not commit itself to offer all the courses, programs, and majors listed in this catalog unless there is sufficient demand to justify them. Some courses may be offered only in alternate semesters or years, or even less frequently if there is little demand. Course Descriptions For a listing of the most current USF System approved course descriptions refer to the Course Inventory Database. Comprehensive Examination Prior to clearance for the degree, candidates must perform satisfactorily on a comprehensive examination or an alternative method designated by the academic unit to measure student competency in the major area. Students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit during the semester when the comprehensive examination is attempted. If the exam is attempted between semesters, the student must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit in the semester before or following the exam. 145 Cross-Listing 4000/6000 Courses When courses are cross listed it is expected that the 4000 and 6000 courses will have distinct syllabi demonstrating different depth and breadth of the subject matter as reflected in the course requirements. The courses presuppose different audiences, and the intention is to offer them at distinct levels. Degree Requirements USF System Regulation USF3.009: Graduate Degree Requirements Graduate students must meet all of the requirements of USFSM graduate degree requirements, as specified in the USFSM Graduate Catalogs, as well as any College or Program degree requirements. Students must be in good standing to graduate. College and Program degree requirements are approved by USFSM Academic Program's Committee. Each Catalog is published and in effect for the academic term(s) noted on the title page. Drops A student may drop a course(s) during the drop/add periods (first five days of classes) in order for the course(s) not to appear on any permanent academic records. No tuition or fees will be assessed for course(s) dropped within that period. Courses may not be dropped after the last day of classes except in cases of University Administrative error. Dual Degree Programs A student may wish to pursue two (2) degrees simultaneously. Upon approval by the appropriate College Dean(s) and Regional Vice Chancellor for Academic and Student Affairs, a prescribed number of courses (generally no more than nine (9) hours of core or basic courses) required for one degree may be applied to another degree that requires the same courses, without repetition or alternative courses. Contact the College for procedures for applying for a Dual Degree program. Enrollment during Semester of Graduation Students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) graduate hours during the semester of graduation. 146 Enrollment Continuous All graduate degree-seeking students must be continuously enrolled. Continuous enrollment is defined as completing, with grades assigned, a minimum of six (6) hours of graduate credit every three (3) continuous semesters. Colleges and programs may have additional requirements. Students on an approved leave of absence are not subject to the enrollment requirement for the time approved for the leave. See also the Time Limitation Policy. Enrollment for Graduate Teaching and Research Assistants Graduate Teaching and Research Assistants should be full-time students. Exceptions must be approved by the College Dean and the Regional Vice Chancellor for Academic and Student Affairs. Full-Time Graduate Student Definition Graduate Students taking nine (9) or more hours toward their degree in the fall or spring semester, or taking six (6) or more hours in the summer semester, will be classified as Full-Time students for academic purposes. For financial aid requirements, contact the Office of Financial Aid. 147 Graduate Grading System In this section... Continuing Registration Grades (Z) Grade Point Average (GPA) Incomplete (I) Missing (M) Plus/Minus Grading Satisfactory (S)/ Unsatisfactory (U) Continuing Registration Grades (Z) The \"Z\" grade shall be used to indicate continuing registration in multi-semester internship or thesis/dissertation courses where the final grade to be assigned will indicate the complete sequence of courses or satisfactory completion of the thesis/dissertation. Upon satisfactory completion of a multi-semester internship the final grade assigned will be an \"S.\" Note: Graduation will not be certified until all courses have been satisfactorily completed. No grade changes will be processed after the student has graduated except in the case of university error. Procedures requiring petitions are processed through the college Dean's office. Grade Point Average (GPA) The GPA is computed by dividing the total number of quality points by the total number of graded (A-F) hours completed. The total quality points are figured by multiplying the number of credits assigned to each course by the quality point value of the grade given. The GPA is truncated to two decimals (3.48) and is not rounded up. Credit hours for courses with grades of I, IU, M, MU, N, S, U, Q and grades which are preceded by T (Transfer) are subtracted from the total hours attempted before the GPA is calculated. Graduate students are not eligible for grade forgiveness. All grades earned, regardless of course level, will be posted on the transcript. If a student retakes a course, both grades will be used in the determination of the GPA. Courses taken at USF as non-degree-seeking are not computed in the GPA unless the courses are transferred in and applied to the degree requirements. The program and the college must approve such actions. Grades for transfer credits accepted toward the degree program will not be counted in the GPA unless the coursework in question was taken as a non-degree-seeking student at a USF System Institution and meets the requirements stated above (see Transfer of Credit section). 148 Incomplete (I) Definition: An Incomplete grade \"I\" is exceptional and granted at the instructor's discretion only when students are unable to complete course requirements due to illness or other circumstances beyond their control. This applies to all gradable courses, including pass/fail (S/U). Students may only be eligible for an \"I\" when: majority of the student's work for a course has been completed before the end of the semester the work that has been completed must be qualitatively satisfactory the student has requested consideration for an \"I\" grade as soon as possible but no later than the last day of finals week. The student must request consideration for an Incomplete grade and obtain an \"I\" Grade Contract from the instructor of record. Even though the student may meet the eligibility requirements for this grade, the course instructor retains the right to make the final decision on granting a student's request for an Incomplete. The course instructor and student must complete and sign the \"I\" Grade Contract Form that describes the work to be completed, the date it is due, and the grade the student would earn factoring in a zero for all incomplete assignments. The due date can be negotiated and extended by student/instructor as long as it does not exceed one semester from the original date grades were due for that course. The instructor must file a copy of the \"I\" Grade Contract in the college that offered the course by the date grades are due. The instructor must not require students to either re-register for the course or audit the course in order to complete the \"I\" grade. Students may register to audit the course, with the instructor's approval, but cannot re-take the course for credit until the I grade is cleared. An \"I\" grade not cleared within the next academic semester (including summer semester) will revert to the grade noted on the contract. \"I\" grades are not computed in the GPA, but the grade noted on the contract will be computed in the GPA, retroactive to the semester the course was taken, if the contract is not fulfilled by the specified date. When the final grade is assigned, if applicable, the student will be placed on academic probation or academically dismissed (refer to Automated Academic Probation Procedures for information). Students cannot be admitted to doctoral candidacy or Example: Current Semester student has a \"B\" in the course, not including the grade for the missing assignment, therefore is eligible for an \"I\" student's grade, including a zero for the missed work, would be a \"D\" student and instructor complete the \"I\" Grade Contract, assigning an \"ID\" (Incomplete +\"D\" grade) Deadline Agreed Upon in Contract (e.g. two weeks)* If the student completes the work as agreed upon in the Contract by the noted deadline instructor submits a change of grade student earns final grade comprised of all completed coursework 149 If the student does not complete the work as agreed upon in the Contract by the noted deadline \"I\" automatically drops off and the grade of \"D\" remains. GPA is recalculated for the current semester and retroactively recalculated for the semester in which the \"I\" was granted. *Although the instructor establishes the deadline for completion of the work, the deadline may only extend through the end of the subsequent semester. Missing (M) An \"M\" grade is automatically assigned as a default grade when the instructor does not submit a grade for a student. Unless a change of grade is submitted, the \"M\" grade will remain on the transcript and will not be computed in the student's GPA. Plus/Minus Grading Effective fall semester 2000, graduate and undergraduate grades are assigned quality points in the Grade Point Average (GPA) grading system. The +/- designation must be included in the syllabus provided at the beginning of the course. The use of the +/- grading system is at the discretion of the instructor. The syllabus policy is available in the office of Academic Affairs. Letter grade = number of grade points A+ 4.00 A Excellent Performance 4.00 A- 3.67 B+ 3.33 B Good Performance 3.00 B- C Average Performance 2.00 C- 1.67 D Poor Performance 1.00 D- 0.67 F 0.00 150 Other Grades E Course repeated, not included in GPA FF Failure/academic dishonesty I Incomplete IF Incomplete grade changed to Failure IU Incomplete grade changed to Unsatisfactory M No grade submitted by instructor N Audit R Repeated Course S Satisfactory U Unsatisfactory W Withdrawal from course without penalty WC Withdrawal for extenuating circumstances Z Indicates continuing registration *Incomplete grade policy change effective fall 08. IF grades earned and posted prior to fall 2008 do calculate in the GPA; IF grades earned as of fall 2008 forward do not calculate in the GPA Refer to Incomplete Grade Policy for more information. Satisfactory (S)/ Unsatisfactory (U) Graduate students may not take courses in the major on an S/U (satisfactory / unsatisfactory) basis unless courses are specifically designated S/U in the Catalog. Students may take courses outside of the major on a S/U basis with prior approval of the course professor, major professor or advisor, and the Dean of the College in which the student is seeking a degree. The student may apply a maximum of six (6) hours of such credit (excluding those courses for which S/U is designated in the Catalog) toward a master's degree. Directed Research, Thesis, and Dissertation courses are designated as variable credit and are graded on an S/U basis only. Before a student begins work under Directed Research, a written agreement must be completed between the student and the professor concerned, setting forth in detail the requirements of the course. 151 Graduation Information Graduate students may not participate in commencement exercises until all requirements for the degree sought have been fulfilled. Application for Degree and Graduation To graduate, a student must submit the Master's Degree Application online in their Oasis account. This application must be submitted in the term of expected graduation by the deadline noted in the academic calendar. If a student applies for graduation and is not approved, a new Application for Degree must be submitted by the deadline in a new term. In order for the degree statement to appear on a student's academic record, the student must file the aforementioned application whether or not participation in the commencement ceremony is desired. Inquiries concerning approval or denial of graduation should be made to the appropriate college. It is the student's responsibility to clear all \"I\" (Incomplete) and \"M\" (Missing) grades in all courses and to provide official transcripts of all transferred coursework needed for graduation at least three (3) weeks prior to the end of the term in which the student expects to graduate. Certification Letters Students in need of verification of the degree prior to receiving their diploma may request a Letter of Certification. This letter specifies that the student has finished all of the requirements for the degree and the date the degree will be conferred on. The letter must include the student's identification number, name of degree program and official name of the degree. The College Dean (or designee) must sign the Letter of Certification. Institutional Residency The majority of credits toward a graduate degree must be earned through instruction offered by the institution (e.g. USF Tampa, USF St. Petersburg, USF Sarasota-Manatee) granting the degree. For information about the minimum number of credit hours required for the degree refer to the degree requirements in the program listing and the Transfer of Credit Policy. 152 Leaves of Absence (LOA) Leaves of absence may be granted to students under exceptional and unavoidable circumstances. Students requesting a LOA must specify the reasons for the leave, as well as the duration. Requested LOA may be approved for up to two (2) years. Students requiring less than three (3) consecutive terms of absence do not need an approved LOA if they meet the continuous enrollment requirement. Students with an approved LOA must be enrolled in the first semester after the leave expires. To request a LOA, the student must complete the Leave of Absence Request form. The LOA must be approved by the Professor, the College Dean and Regional Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and is noted in the student's record. If the LOA is granted, the time absent does not count against the student's time limit to obtain the degree. Students returning from an approved LOA must reactivate their status by contacting the Graduate Admission Office for procedures. Major and Co-Major Professor The Major Professor serves as the student's advisor and mentor. Students should confer with the college to confirm the internal process and timeline for the selection and appointment of the Major Professor. The student must identify a major professor and receive that person's agreement to serve as major professor. The selection of the Major Professor must be approved and appointed by the college dean as soon as possible, but no later than the time the student has completed 50% of the program. Students must have a major professor in order to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress. If a major professor cannot be identified or in the event a major professor is unable or unwilling to continue serving on the student's committee, the student is responsible for finding another major professor. Students who are unable to find a replacement major professor should confer with the college dean for available options (including converting to a non-thesis program if available.) If no other options exist the student may be requested to voluntarily withdraw from the program or may be honorably withdrawn in good academic standing. The student and major professor should plan a program of study which, when completed, will satisfy the degree requirements specified. A copy of this program, signed by the student and professor, must be maintained in the student's college file. Major Professors must meet the following requirements: Be graduate faculty, as defined by the University. Faculty who do not meet this definition may serve as Co-Major Professor Be engaged in current and sustained scholarly, creative, or research activities and have met college (or equivalent) requirements Have been approved by the college (or equivalent) to serve as a Major Professor or Co-Major Professor. The membership of graduate faculty will be based upon criteria developed within the appropriate program and approved at the college level. These criteria must be forwarded to the Regional Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. 153 In the event a Major Professor leaves the University (i.e. for an appointment at another university, due to retirement, etc.) and the Major Professor is willing to continue serving on the student's committee, the Major Professor then becomes a Co-Major Professor on the committee and another faculty is appointed as the other Co-Major Professor. It is important that one of the Co-Major Professors be accessible on the university campus for the student to make satisfactory progress on the thesis. In the event a Major Professor is on temporary leave (e.g. sabbatical, research, etc.); the Major Professor shall coordinate with the college dean to facilitate the needs of the student. In some instances a student may choose to have two professors serve as Major Professor. In this situation the faculty members are approved as \"Co-Major Professors\" and jointly serve in that role. Consequently both faculty must sign approval on paperwork pertaining to the student's processing (i.e. committee form, change of committee form, etc.) Appointment of a (Co)-Major Professor(s) may be rescinded by the college dean, with the approval of the appropriate college (or equivalent) faculty committee (separate from student advisory committee.) Mandatory Attendance at First Class Meeting USF System Policy Number 10-006: Registration Changes for Courses by Students and Instructors (Drop/Adds, Withdrawals, Deletions and Auditing) USF System Regulation - Registration - 4.0101 All students are required to attend class the first day a class meets, for both online and on-campus courses. Students unable to attend must contact the instructor prior to the first day to ensure they are not dropped from the course. This policy is not applicable to courses in the following categories: Educational Outreach, FEEDS Program, Community Experiential Learning (CEL), Cooperative Education Training, and courses that do not have regularly scheduled meeting days/times (such as, directed reading/research or study, individual research, thesis, dissertation, internship, practica, etc.). Students are responsible for dropping undesired courses in these categories by the 5th day of classes to avoid fee liability and academic penalty. Minimum Hours A minimum of thirty (30) graduate hours (5000 level and up) is required for a master's degree, at least sixteen (16) hours of which must be at the 6000 level. At least twenty (20) hours must be in formal, regularly scheduled course work (i.e. not directed research, independent study, internships, etc.), at least ten (10) of which must be at the 6000 level. Undergraduate courses may not be used to satisfy the minimum thirty (30) hours in master's course requirements but may be taken to meet specific prerequisites. All graduate and undergraduate courses taken as a graduate student count in the overall GPA, whether or not they count toward the minimum hours for the degree. Graduate students may not enroll for more than eighteen (18) hours in any semester without written permission from the College Dean. 154 Off-Campus Courses and Programs Graduate courses and programs are offered at locations other than the Tampa, Sarasota, and St. Petersburg campuses. Information on course enrollment procedures for off-campus courses and programs may be obtained from the College in which the courses or programs are offered. Probation Any student who is not in good standing at the end of a semester shall be considered on probation as of the following semester. The college may also place students on probation for other reasons as designated by the program. Notification of probation shall be made to the student in writing by the college, with a copy to the College Dean. At the end of each probationary semester, the department shall recommend, in writing, to the College Dean one of the following: 1. Removal of probation 2. Continued probation; OR 3. Dismissal from the degree program. Students with a GPA below 3.00 for two consecutive semesters will be prevented from registering for courses without the permission of the College Dean. The College Dean will notify the Regional Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs in cases of academic dismissal. To be readmitted, the student will need to reapply for admission, meeting the admission criteria in place at the time. For information contact your college dean's office. Program Degree Requirements In order to graduate, students must meet all requirements specified in the USFSM Catalog of their choice, except as noted below. As the University is dynamic, changes and updates to the catalog are anticipated. In contract to program requirements, which are tied to a specific catalog, all students must comply with University policies and procedures that come into effect each catalog year. Students cannot choose a USFSM catalog published prior to admission (or readmission) or during an academic year in which they did not complete at least two terms. If a student is dropped from the system and must be reinstated, the student's choice of catalog is limited to the USFSM catalog in effect at the time of readmission or any one catalog published during their continuous re-enrollment. If state law or certification requirements change, the student must comply with the most current standard or criteria. If the College makes fundamental changes to the program that necessitates changes in the degree requirements of enrolled students, the needs of those students will be explicitly addressed in the proposal for change and scrutinized by the Regional Vice Chancellor for Academic and Student Affairs. 155 USF System policies and procedures not related to degree requirements such as academic grievance procedures, student conduct code and other procedural processes and definitions may be updated each year and the student will be held to the most current catalog and procedures available. USFSM does not commit itself to offer all the courses, programs, and majors listed in this catalog. If the student cannot meet all of the graduation requirements specified in the catalog of choice as a result of decisions and changes made by the University, appropriate substitutions will be determined by the program to ensure that the student is not penalized. Program of Study It is recommended that the college establish a program of study for the student at the time of admission into the graduate program, outlining the requirements for the degree sought. In the event state mandates, accreditation requirements, etc., make changes to the degree requirements necessary, it is recommended that the program provide an addendum to the program of study outlining what is required for degree completion. Student Responsibilities USFSM's colleges and programs have establish certain academic requirements that must be met before a degree is granted. These requirements concern such things as curricula and courses, majors and minors, and academic residence. Faculty and graduate program directors are available to help the student understand and arrange to meet these requirements, but the student is responsible for fulfilling them. At the end of a student's course of study, if all requirements for graduation have not been satisfied, the degree will not be granted. For this reason, it is important for students to acquaint themselves with all regulations and to remain currently informed throughout their college careers. Courses, programs, and requirements described in the USFSM catalog may be suspended, deleted, restricted, supplemented, or changed in any other manner at any time at the sole discretion of the University and the USF Board of Trustees. It is the student's responsibility to make sure that he/she has met all degree requirements as specified in the Degree Requirements section of this publication, as well as any College and Program requirements for the degree. Thesis Thesis If a thesis is required, it must conform to the guidelines of the USF System. Refer to the Electronic Thesis and Dissertation (ETD) Resource Center for complete information about requirements, procedures, and deadlines. 156 Refer to the enrollment requirements in the Academic Policies section in the Catalog. Format Instructions with regards to formatting can be found at the following website. http://www.grad.usf.edu/ETD-res-faq.php Directed Research Directed Research hours may satisfy up to 50% of the thesis hour requirement. Manuscript Processing Fee USF System Regulation USF4.0107: Fees, Fines and Penalties, Students participating in the thesis process are required to pay a processing fee. More information is available on the Thesis and Dissertation website. Exchange of Thesis for Non-Thesis Credit If a student changes from thesis to non-thesis during a semester and is currently enrolled in thesis credit, the current thesis credits may be exchanged without academic penalty if a Graduate School Petition is filed with the Graduate School no later than the last day to withdraw without Academic Penalty. If a student enrolled in a thesis required program has taken thesis credits but elects to change to non-thesis track or program, the accumulated thesis credits may not be exchanged or converted to another non-structured credit. The thesis hours will remain on the transcript and will retain the \"Z\" grade. Thesis Defense Policies and procedures for the thesis defense are handled within the College and Program. Contact the College and Program for requirements. Thesis Final Submission Guidelines Information on requirements for submission of the finished and approved manuscript copies is available online at the (ETD) Resource Center website. Students who fail to submit the final copy of a thesis by the posted submission deadline will be considered for graduation in the following semester and must therefore apply for graduation by the posted deadline, enroll in a minimum of two (2) thesis hours for that subsequent semester, and meet the submission requirements as posted on the (ETD) Resource Center website. Only after the Graduate School has approved the manuscript can the student be certified for the degree. Mandatory Electronic Submission Students are required to submit the thesis in an electronic format (ETD). Requirements and procedures are available at the (ETD) Resource Center website. Submission to Pro-Quest All theses will be submitted to ProQuest for microfilming and archiving, effective Fall 2010. Changes after Publication 157 Once a thesis is approved and accepted by the Graduate School for publication, it cannot be changed. Release of Thesis Publications The University recognizes the benefits from collaboration with sponsors on research projects but also recognizes the possibility of conflicts of interest in the disclosure of the results of the collaborations. While the sponsor's economic interests in the restriction of disclosure should be considered, the University has a primary mission to extend knowledge and disseminate it to the public and the broader academic community. The University's \"Statement of Policy Regarding Inventions and Works\" acknowledges the possible need for delays in publication of sponsored research to protect the sponsor's interests, but it provides no definite guidelines for the restrictions of publication beyond the statement: \"Disclosure delays mutually acceptable to the Inventor, the Vice President for Research, and the sponsor, if any, are authorized in order to allow patent applications to be filled prior to publication, thereby preserving patent rights...\"[4] To protect the University's primary goal from un-due compromise, the University has adopted the following guidelines: 1. The recommendations of sponsors, regarding publication of research results should be considered advisory rather than mandatory. 1. In support of academic discourse and the mission to promote and share academic works, Theses will be released for worldwide access once submitted to and approved by the USF System Graduate School. In the event that a patent or copyright application provides reason to delay the release of the Thesis, a petition to request a one year delay may be submitted to the Graduate School for consideration. Such requests must be received by the format check of the thesis. 1. Students should not be delayed in the final defense of their theses by agreements involving publication delays. Duty to Disclose New Inventions and Works USF System Policy 0-300: Inventions and Works and USF System Regulation USF12.003: Inventions and Works For information about the requirements of this policy contact the USF System Division of Patents and Licensing at (813) 974-0994. Thesis Change of Grade In the semester in which the final manuscript has been received, reviewed, and certified for permanent filing in the University Library, the Graduate School submits the change of grade from \"Z\" to \"S\" for the last registration of thesis courses to the USF System Office of the Registrar when all grades are due at the end of the semester. [1] Deviations from the available format are acceptable if approved in advance by the Supervisory Committee and Graduate School [2] Include either References or a Bibliography, as specified by your style guide [3] Include either References or a Bibliography, as specified by your style guide [4] April Burke, \"University Policies on Conflict of Interest and Delay of Publications,\" Report of the Clearinghouse on University-Industry Relations, Association of American Universities, February, 1985. 158 Thesis Committee Thesis Committee Students working toward a thesis degree will have the benefit of a committee of members of the graduate faculty. The committee will approve the course of study for the student and plan for research, supervise the research and any comprehensive qualifying exams, and read and approve the thesis for content and format. Composition The committee will consist of the major professor and at least two other members or co-major professors and at least one other member of the department or area of interest in which the degree is sought. (Colleges and Programs may require additional committee members and specify characteristics.) Member Definition All graduate faculty, as defined by the University and the College, and approved by their college, as qualified to be a member of and/or supervise a committee. Persons desiring to serve on a Graduate committee who are not defined as Graduate Faculty (i.e. visiting faculty, professionals, etc.) by the University and the College must submit a curriculum vitae and be approved by the College, and, as needed, the Regional Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs for each committee. Committee members must meet the following requirements: Be graduate or affiliate graduate faculty, as defined by the University Have the background and expertise that contributes to the success of the student. In addition to the requirements specified in the Graduate Faculty definition, committee membership will be based upon criteria developed within the appropriate program or department and approved at the college level. These criteria must be forwarded to the Dean of the College. Approval Once a committee has been determined, a Supervisory Committee Form needs to be completed by the student and submitted to the Committee Members for original signatures. Check with the College for instructions and forms. The original appointment form and two (2) copies should be submitted to the College Dean's office for approval. A copy of the approved form should be kept in the student's file. An approved and current Committee Form must be on file in the college before graduation may be certified. Committee forms need to be processed as early in the program as possible, but no later than the semester prior to graduation. (May institute additional requirements for membership on Supervisory Committees.) Changes to Committee Changes to a Supervisory Committee must be submitted on a Change of Committee Form. Check with the College for instructions and forms. Original signatures of faculty being added to the Committee, along with the approval signature of the (Co-) Major Professor(s), must be on the form. Faxed signatures are acceptable. Faculty who are removed from the Committee are not required to sign the form, provided that the (Co-) Major Professor(s) has signed. In such instances the signature of the (Co-)Major Professor(s) indicate(s) approval of the change, as well as acknowledgement and approval of the change by the removed member. Any non-faculty being added to a committee must submit a Curriculum Vitae (CV) for college approval. Change of Committee Forms should be submitted for approval as soon as the change takes place. Changes to a Committee are official only once approved and filed by the program and college. 159 Time Limit Extensions In the event that a student nears the end of the time limitation as specified below, but the student needs more time to complete the degree, the student may submit a request for an extension using the Time Limit Extension Request Form. The requests must include the following: the reasons for the delay in completion, the anticipated time needed for completion, and endorsements from the graduate faculty advisor, College Dean or designee, a detailed plan of study and timeline for the remaining requirements for the degree Note - for the time limit extension procedures, if the time limit extension will cause courses taken or transferred into the program to be older than seven (7) years, then a request for course concurrency may be required or the courses may be invalidated toward the degree requirements, per the time limit policy. If approved, the time limit extension also applies to courses applied toward the degree. However, programs may require additional or repeat coursework as part of the condition of the time limit extension. Students who exceed the time limitations may have their registration placed on hold until a request for extension has been approved. Only one time limit extension request is permitted. Students who are temporarily unable to continue the program should submit a Leave of Absence Request, which extends the time limit for the duration of the approved leave (see the section on Leaves of Absence in the Enrollment Requirements section.) Time Limitations Master's degrees must be completed within five (5) years from the student's date of admission for graduate study. Courses taken prior to admission to the USFSM graduate program, for example as non-degree seeking or from other institutions that were transferred in, can be no older than seven years at the time of graduation. Master's degrees (including dual degree programs) that require coursework in excess of 50 credit hours may be granted a longer statute of limitations. Veterans Administration Students receiving Veterans' Administration benefits should confirm their enrollment requirements with the Office of Veterans' Services or Veterans' Coordinator. 160 Voluntary Withdrawal from the Program Students may voluntarily withdraw from their graduate degree program. A Voluntary Withdrawal cannot be retroactive. The effective date of the withdrawal will be entered into the student's record by the USF System Office of the Registrar as the first business day after the end of the semester. Students who wish to withdraw must submit a Voluntary Withdrawal Form. Once processed, the student's status will be changed from Graduate Degree Seeking to Non-Degree Seeking. A change to Non-Degree Seeking status could adversely impact financial aid. Questions regarding this should be directed to the Financial Aid Department at (941) 359-4622. The student will remain financially and academically responsible for any course(s) for which they have registered. The student may request to drop or delete courses they are registered for by submitting a Graduate Withdrawal Request Form. Withdrawals A student may withdraw from a course(s) between the second and tenth week of the semester (except for summer sessions - see the Summer Schedule of Classes for dates and courses with alternative calendars), however, tuition and fees will be assessed for any course(s) withdrawn by the student after the first week. The student's academic record will reflect a \"W\" grade for any course(s) withdrawal between the second and tenth week of the semester. Under specific conditions, consideration for refund of tuition and fees may be requested if a Fee Adjustment Request form accompanied by verifiable supporting documentation is submitted to the Office of the Registrar at USF Tampa within six (6) months from the end of the semester to which any refund would be applicable. Students who withdraw may not continue to attend classes. Effective Fall 2016, all students will be limited to two (2) withdrawals from graduate courses while enrolled as degree-seeking or a non-degree seeking at USF. Requests for withdrawals from graduate level courses are submitted via the Withdrawal Request form. Only in extenuating circumstances will approval be granted for more than two graduate course withdrawals. Appeals for additional graduate course withdrawals due to extenuating circumstances must be submitted via the Graduate Petition Form. 161 Undergraduate Information The announcements, information, policies, rules, regulations, and procedures set forth in this Catalog are for information only and are subject to continual review and change without notice.

The office is responsible for processing applications for admission for new undergraduate students, former students returning, and reviews transfer credit completed at other regionally-accredited institutions for determination of transferability. Admission to USFSM requires evidence of ability to handle academic work, capacity to think creatively, and strong motivation. The minimum admission requirements are designed to help identify applicants whose academic background indicates potential for success at USFSM; however, satisfaction of minimum admission requirements does not guarantee acceptance. The admission of new students at all levels is on a selective basis within curricular, space, and fiscal limitations. The selection process may include such factors as grades, test scores, pattern of courses completed, class rank, educational objectives, past conduct, school recommendations, personal recommendations, and portfolios. Preference for admission in any term will be given to those applicants whose credentials indicate the greatest promise of academic success. The University encourages applications from qualified applicants of both sexes and from all cultural, racial, religious, ethnic, and age groups. Requests for waiver of the $30.00 application fee are considered by the Director of Admissions if payment of this fee creates severe financial hardship and serves as a deterrent to application. Students are admitted to USF Sarasota-Manatee in accordance with the mission and goals of the University and within enrollment limitations established by the Department of Education and the Florida Legislature. Admission Criteria General Admissions Requirements USFSM includes the minimum admissions requirements in the Undergraduate Catalog and the Florida Board of Governors' website (6.002 Freshmen and 6.004 Transfer Students). Satisfaction of these requirements does not guarantee admission. USFSM gives preference to applicants whose credentials indicate the greatest promise of academic success and graduation. USFSM considers applicants for admission using the same criteria and minimum admission requirements in effect for the term of entry. No pre-admission consideration is given to an applicant with a disability (USF System Policy 0-108 Disability and Accommodations). Applicants must submit a completed application for admission that is available on-line, a nonrefundable $30 application fee payable in U.S. dollars and, if English is not the applicant's primary or native language, scores on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). USFSM 163 waives the TOEFL or IELTS requirement if the applicant has an Associate in Arts (A.A.) degree/certificate from a Florida public college/university with completion of English composition 1 and 2, or meets the Board of Governors' minimum SAT Evidence-Based Reading and Writing score or ACT scores in Reading and Writing. Performance in course work at any of the USF System Institutions attempted as a non-degree-seeking student does not qualify an applicant for admission to USFSM's undergraduate degree program except if completed as part of the approved Pathways programs offered through INTO USF or other approved program. Prior to registration, each student accepted for admission must submit a signed medical history form, including documentation of appropriate immunizations as required by USF Policy 33-002. New undergraduates, including both freshmen and transfers, must complete the appropriate Orientation/Advising/Registration program before the first day of classes of their term of entry. Freshman Admission Requirements Admission is competitive and based on a variety of factors, including the strength of high school curriculum, record of academic achievement and ACT or SAT scores. USFSM also values special talents and abilities in and out of the classroom. Applicants must also meet the State University System of Florida (SUS) minimum number of academic units of high school credit. See website: http://www.flbog.edu/forstudents/ati/ftcs.php To receive priority fall admissions consideration and to be considered for merit-based scholarships from the Office of Admissions, students must submit an admissions application by January 2 and have a complete application with official supporting documents by January 15. For additional information about the awarding process and requirements, please visit the Admissions website. General Transfer Requirements The Florida Statutes and Florida Board of Governors' Regulation 6.004 govern transfer admissions. 1. Transfer applicants must be in good standing, have a 2.00 grade-point average, and be eligible to re-enroll at the last regionally accredited institution attended as a degree-seeking student. 2. All transfer applicants must meet satisfactory academic progress criteria as determined by the U.S. Department of Education. USF System Institutions have specific transfer admission requirements which may include a completion of specific percentage of courses attempted. An excessive number of course withdrawals and/or failed and repeated courses could negatively affect admissibility as a transfer to USFSM. 3. Transfer applicants must submit official transcripts from all post-secondary colleges and schools where credit was attempted and/or earned. 4. USFSM Admissions computes grade-point averages based on grades earned in courses acceptable for transfer credit; incomplete grades compute as failures. 5. Transfer applicants must have completed two credits of one foreign language or American Sign Language in high school, or the equivalent of eight to ten semester hours in the undergraduate institution(s) attended or demonstrate equivalent foreign language competence as described in BOG Regulation 6.004. USFSM exempts transfers from this admissions requirement if they received an Associate in Arts degree prior to September 1, 1989, or if prior to August 1, 1989, they enrolled in program of study leading to an associate's degree from a Florida 164 public college or university and have maintained continuous enrollment until they are admitted to a university. A student establishes continuous enrollment by taking a course at least one term in each twelve-month period beginning with the student's first enrollment in the Florida College System and continuing until the student enrolls in a SUS Institution. Lower-level Transfer Requirements: Fewer than 30 Transferable Semester Hours USFSM accepts lower-level transfer applicants who have earned at least 12, but fewer than 60 semester hours of transferable college credit following graduation from high school. Applicants with less than 12 transferable credit hours are considered as freshman in the application process and must meet FTIC admission criteria. Lower-level and mid-level transfer applicants must meet all requirements explained below under the Mid-Level Transfer Student and Upper-level Transfer Requirements section. 30 or More, but Fewer than 60 Transferable Semester Hours (Mid-Level Transfer Students) Lower-level transfer students with 30 or more but less than 60 transferable semester hours (AKA Mid-level transfer students) who have successfully completed (C or higher) at least one transferable English composition course and one transferable college level mathematics course that consists of three (3) semester credit hours are not required to submit ACT/SAT scores. Mid-level transfer applicants are required to meet the state foreign language requirement (passing two years of the same foreign language) prior to admission to USFSM, and are required to submit an official high school transcript if the foreign language requirement was completed in high school. Mid-level transfer applicants who do not meet the above requirements must submit an official high school transcript showing a minimum 2.50 GPA on a 4.00 scale recalculated by USFSM. In addition, they must submit official SAT or ACT scores and meet minimum criteria. The minimum SAT scores are 500 in Evidence-based Reading and Writing and 500 in Mathematics. The minimum SAT scores on the SAT taken prior to March 2016 is a 460 in Critical Reading and 460 in Mathematics. The minimum ACT scores are 19 in Reading, 19 in Mathematics, and 18 in English. Upper-level Transfer Requirements USFSM grants admission to graduates of state approved Florida public college or universities who hold the A.A. degree/certificate. Florida Administrative Rule 6A-10.024 (Articulation Between and Among Universities, Community Colleges, and School Districts) governs the admission of A.A. degree/certificate degree transfers from Florida public colleges and universities. Undergraduate transfer students who have not earned the A.A. degree/certificate from a public community/junior college or state university in Florida or who have attended another college after receipt of the A.A. degree/certificate from a public community/junior college or state university in Florida must have an overall 2.00 grade-point average on a 4.00 scale in all college-level courses attempted and acceptable to transfer. Associate in Arts degree holders who are not exempt from the foreign language requirement and all other upper-level transfer students admitted without meeting the foreign language admission requirement must satisfy the foreign language requirement prior to graduation. Undergraduate transfer students who have not earned the A.A. degree from a Florida public institution or who have attended another college after receipt of the A.A. must minimally meet the requirements below to be considered for admission; however, satisfying these minimum requirements does not guarantee admission. 1. Be in good standing, have a 2.0 grade-point average, and eligible to return to the last regionally-accredited institution attended as a degree-seeking student or a non-regionally accredited institution participating in the State Course Numbering System (SCNS) with SCNS approved transferable credits; 165 2. Passed two years of the same foreign language in high school or 8 to 10 semester hours of the same foreign language at a previous college or university. Students who entered a Florida College System institution prior to August 1, 1989 and maintain continuous enrollment until the time of their USFSM entry as degree-seeking students may be admitted without the required foreign language study; 3. Meet the minimum grade-point average required by the program if entering a limited-access program and transferring 60 or more semester hours; 4. Applicants whose native language is not English must present a minimum score of 79 (Internet-based test) on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or 6.5 on the IELTS. Upper-level transfer applicants for admission to a limited-access major must meet program requirements prior to admission to the University. Please refer to the requirements listed in the College sections of the catalog. USFSM also considers applicants who do not fully meet the minimum requirements as stated in #1 and #2 above but who have important attributes, special talents, or unique circumstances that may contribute to a representative and diverse student body. A committee considers these undergraduate transfer applicants for admission on the basis of other demonstrated evidence of promise for academic success. These applicants should also submit appropriate alternative evidence of academic achievement, ability, motivation, and responsibility that indicates potential for academic success at USFSM. Admission Denial Any applicant who does not meet minimum admission requirements and/or is denied admission to USFSM may submit an appeal in writing within 30 days of notification for reconsideration of the admissions decision for review by the Director of Admissions. The request must provide new reasons/evidence why this reconsideration is warranted based on extenuating circumstances and/or appropriate alternative evidence of academic achievement, ability, motivation, and responsibility that indicates potential for academic success. In addition to the admission criteria, other factors may be considered including, but not limited to, improvements in high school record, family education background, socioeconomic status, graduation from a lower performing high school, graduation from an International Baccalaureate program, geographic location, military service, special talents, and/or abilities, or other special circumstances. After a thorough review of the student's profile by the appropriate committee, the committee may conclude that the applicant should be admitted if it is deemed that the student can be successful academically and graduate from USF System institutions. Student-initiated petitions that are denied by the Appeals Committee may be further appealed to the Dean who makes the final decision. Academic services and/or programs designed to enhance the success of any student admitted based on a profile exception must be outlined in the Committee's recommendation for admission. Undergraduate applicants\u2014freshmen or transfers\u2014who are denied admission as a degree-seeking student may not enroll as a non-degree-seeking student. Applicants denied admission to USFSM who have a disability as defined by Board of Governors Regulation 6.018 and Section 1007.02, Florida Statutes may request a reasonable substitution of any requirement for admission in a letter of appeal of the decision as provided by the protocols of USFSM. On appeal of a denial of admission, USFSM may provide reasonable substitution for any course or high school unit requirement for any person who has a documented disability. The applicant may be required to provide documentation as detailed in Board of Governors 166 Regulation 6.018 or Section 1007.264 Florida Statutes that the failure to meet the admission requirements is related to the disability, and USFSM may request other pertinent documents as needed to determine eligibility for substitution under this subsection. USFSM may refuse admission to a student whose record shows previous misconduct that is deemed not to be in the best interest of the University community. The Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities or designee, will review all applications in which prior legal or behavioral conduct issues are noted. When necessary, this officer will contact appropriate parties having knowledge of the applicant and/or the misconduct and make a decision as to whether admission of the applicant would be in the best interest of USFSM. Any applicant denied admission under this Regulation may submit a written appeal to the designated office within ten (10) days after the notification of the denial of admission. A non-degree-seeking student dismissed from USFSM for violations of academic integrity or the USF System's Student Code of Conduct is not eligible for admission as a degree-seeking student to USFSM. If a student dismissed from USFSM subsequently earns a degree from a regionally accredited institution, the student may apply as a degree-seeking student to USFSM. If extenuating circumstances contributed to the dismissal and the student meets current admissions requirements, the student may submit a request for waiver of this rule to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities or designee, for an academic violation, or for a violation of the Code of Conduct. Admission International International undergraduate applicants who are not permanent U.S. residents (BOG Regulation 6.009) must submit applications for admission, application fees, and all required supporting documents by the published deadlines. Applicants living outside of the United States are encouraged to submit required documentation no later than three (3) months prior to the date of desired entry to USFSM or the deadline for the degree program, whichever is earlier. Supporting documentation includes the \"Financial Support Requirements\" form to show proof of availability of financial resources sufficient to cover all educational, maintenance, personal, and travel expenses while attending USFSM without financial assistance from the USF System; all transcripts identifying subjects and grades from the first year of secondary work to the time of application or graduation when applying as an entering freshman or a transfer with less than 60 hours of transferable postsecondary credit; appropriate diploma(s), certificate(s), degree(s), mark-sheet(s) and/or examination(s) passed, from the home country, as evidence of United States equivalent qualifications and academic preparation for the degree program requested; and \"Transfer Clearance Form\" signed by the International Student Advisor, if currently enrolled in a U.S. Institution. Each International applicant must submit a signed health history form, including proof of immunizations as required by USF Policy 33-002, and proof of adequate health insurance coverage as required by USF Regulation 6.0162. All foreign, post-secondary transcripts must be evaluated and/or translated, if applicable, by one of the credential evaluation services identified on the USFSM website and published by the appropriate international admissions office. Documents signed by a notary or other public official with no educational affiliation will not be accepted. Applicants whose native language is not English must demonstrate English proficiency by meeting the minimum test score requirements on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) as follows: 79 on the internet-based test (IBT) or a score of 6.5 on the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). The TOEFL or IELTS requirement may be waived for an undergraduate applicant, if the applicant falls into one of the following categories: 167 has submitted SAT or ACT test scores sufficient to validate English reading and writing proficiency as determined by the Board of Governors of the State University System of Florida, earned an Associate of Arts degree or higher from a domestic regionally accredited institution; has or will be graduating from a domestic high school; or English is the native language in country of origin, pursuant to approved list of countries posted on the USFSM website. Admission Process Admission is granted for an entry term and program as designated in the Official Acceptance Notice from USFSM. Students must enroll for the term to which they are admitted to validate their admission. Official notification is considered a hard-copy acceptance letter on official letterhead that is addressed to the student. Deferment of Admission Students who do not enroll for the admitted term may request a Deferment of Admission for a new entry term that starts within 12 months of the originally requested term. Applicants who request new entry dates must meet the admissions requirements and selection criteria in effect for the new term requested. Entry into selected degree programs may not be available for every term. Provisional Admission An applicant receiving a provisional admission as a degree-seeking student must submit any missing admission credentials, such as official transcripts or test scores required to substantiate eligibility for admission before the beginning of the second term of enrollment. Undergraduate applicants\u2014freshmen and transfers\u2014who do not meet the applicable institutional admissions requirements may be admitted through a profile assessment by a committee under authority delegated by the Florida Board of Governors when there is evidence that the student can be expected to be academically successful. This alternative review may be utilized for applicants who have important attributes, special talents, or unique circumstances that will contribute to a representative and diverse student population. Students admitted to USFSM through a profile assessment because they do not meet the BOG admission requirements (BOG Regulation 6.002, (2)4.(b)) must be reviewed annually by the Director of Student Success, or designee, to ensure that their rates of retention, academic success and graduation remain near or above USFSM's average. USFSM is responsible for required reports regarding students admitted under this section. The success of students admitted under the profile assessment process shall be reviewed by the Board of Trustees. Admission to Limited-Access Degree Program USFSM has established limited-access undergraduate degree programs of study, which are approved by the Florida Board of Governors and the State of Florida Articulation Coordinating Committee. USFSM offers limited-access 168 degree programs in the College of Business, School of Education, and in partnership with the USF Tampa College of Nursing (http://health.usf.edu/nursing). Upon admission to USFSM, transfer students, especially those from Florida's public colleges and universities, shall have equal opportunity to enroll in limited-access baccalaureate programs. In addition to the minimum requirements for admission, applicants seeking entrance to limited-access programs must meet additional requirements published and announced by each limited access program. The USFSM School of Education requires a 2.5 overall GPA and the USFSM College of Business requires a 2.75 overall GPA. All applicants who seek direct admission must meet the criteria of the requested limited-access program including the overall GPA to be eligible for admission. Application Process The USFSM application for admission is available on-line and is required for the following: First time in college applicant for admission to a baccalaureate degree program; Transfer applicant pursuing a baccalaureate degree program; Former USF System institution student who has not been enrolled in a USF System institution during the twelve (12) months or three consecutive terms prior to the new term of admission; Student who has been academically dismissed from the institution; Continuing or former USF System student applying for a second degree or another level of study, i.e. graduate degree program, if required by an institution within the USF System; Graduate applicant; or Non-degree seeking.

For religious exemption applications, contact Student Health Services. For off-campus term exemptions, contact Registrar. Transcripts and Other Documents Official transcripts, test scores, and other required credentials must be received directly from the issuing institution or agency. The applicant is responsible for requesting all required credentials and ensuring that they are received by USFSM Office of Admissions. All documents and credentials submitted are the property of USFSM. Originals or copies of the originals will not be returned to the applicant nor forwarded to any third parties. USFSM reserves the right to request the testing agency to validate any applicant's admission materials including transcripts and test scores such as SAT, ACT, TOEFL, or IELTS used in the admission process if, in the judgment of University officials, there is reason to warrant this validation. An application for admission, residency affidavit, or supporting documentation submitted by or on behalf of a student containing false, fraudulent, or incomplete information may result in the denial of admission, or future semester registration and/or rescission of admission, credit, or degrees awarded by USFSM. Change Term of Entry Applicants may request admission for a different entry term that begins within 12 months of the original date of application without submitting a new application or paying another application fee. Any request for changes of the entry term or change to another institution in the USF System must be submitted in writing, and must provide the names of any college(s) attended and/or college work attempted that is not reflected on the original application. Also, official copies of transcripts must be received by the application deadline for the new term of entry or the degree program, whichever is earlier. If the new term of entry begins more than 12 months after the original application, a new application and fee must be submitted. Articulation Agreement Statewide Articulation Agreements Website Articulation Between and Among Universities, Community Colleges, and School Districts An articulation agreement, in effect since April 13, 1971 and later adopted by the Florida Legislature in statute form as Florida law, governs an effective and orderly transfer of Florida college students into the State University System (SUS). The agreement defines and establishes the Associate in Arts degree from a Florida public college as the basis for all articulation rights. 170 Dual Enrollment Dual enrollment in USFSM classes is open to academically qualified students currently enrolled in a public high school in Sarasota County who are recommended by their principal or designee. Dual enrollment students may take a limited number of courses at USFSM which are creditable toward their high school diploma. Students wishing to enroll in the Dual Enrollment coursework at USFSM must: 1. Have at least Junior standing at a Sarasota County public high school or approved entities at the start of the term in which they wish to enroll. 2. Submit proof of a minimum of 560 on SAT Evidence-based Reading and Writing and a 530 on SAT Math, or a score of 21 on ACT Reading and 21 on ACT Mathematics, or a PERT score of 123 on Math, 106 on Reading and 103 on Writing. 3. Have an unweighted, recalculated high school grade point average of 3.30 or better on a 4.00 scale and satisfied any course prerequisites. The GPA is recalculated from courses completed in English, Mathematics, Natural Science, Social Science, and Foreign Language. Dual enrollment students who enroll in summer courses are required to pay for all costs for that term. For additional information on dual enrollment and the application and approval process, contact the USFSM Office of Admissions and Financial Aid. FUSE Program Freshman applicants who are not offered admission or transfer students with less than 30 transferable credit hours can apply to join the USFSM FUSE Program at one of the Florida College System (FCS) partner schools. Students admitted to the FUSE Program will be placed on an academic graduation path that provides a seamless transition to USFSM. Students on a defined academic path will be advised on course pre-requisites, GPA requirements, tests, and any other additional criteria necessary for admission into limited access majors. FUSE students will also have access to specific USFSM and USF System events and activities. For more information, visit http://sar.usfsm.edu/fuse/. Readmissions of Returning Former Students A degree-seeking undergraduate who has not enrolled at USFSM during the last 12 months must complete a new Application for Admission and pay the $30.00 non-refundable application fee to USFSM by the deadline for the term of requested re-entry. Undergraduate students returning to seek a baccalaureate degree must be in good academic standing and eligible to return to the USFSM as well as the last institution attended as a degree-seeking student. For all college-level academic courses attempted at any institution since last enrolling at USFSM, the applicant's transfer GPA must meet or exceed the GPA required of new transfer students at the time of readmission. 171 Former students who have attended one or more institutions since their last enrollment must request official transcripts of all work attempted at the other institution(s) be sent to the Office of Admissions. Acceptability of transfer credits toward completion of degree programs will be determined by the college of the student's major. The Academic Regulations Committees (ARC) have the Power to Approve (PTA) petitions for undergraduate or non-degree seeking students that fail to maintain a 2.00 GPA and are Academically Dismissed (AD) from USFSM. (Refer to the Academic Probation and Academic Dismissal Policies.) Academic Regulations Committees also may approve the readmission of students who qualify for Academic Renewal to have portions of their academic record not counted in the determination of the GPA for graduation purposes. (Refer to the Academic Renewal Policy.) Summer Beginnings Program USFSM's Summer Beginnings Program is a transitional program, designed to offer a comprehensive and cohort-based summer experience prior to an incoming freshman's first fall semester. Students in this program take college-level coursework during the summer term and engage with both student life and academic support initiatives designed to prepare them for success throughout their time at USFSM. Transfer Credit Evaluation The receipt and evaluation of transfer credits is the responsibility of the Office of Admissions, which will evaluate the acceptability of total transferable credits. The college of the student's major will determine the transfer courses applicable toward the degree and assign equivalent courses to the transcript. In some cases, course equivalents may also be determined by specific colleges that offer the same or similar courses as part of their programs of study. Transfer credits are accepted only from those institutions that are accredited by one of the six regional accrediting agencies at the time the credits were earned. Credits earned at an institution when it is/was in candidacy status will be considered for transfer credit once the awarding institution receives full regional accreditation. If an applicant is applying from a non-regionally accredited school, courses approved for transfer by the Articulation Coordination Committee may be considered for transfer credit. However, the admission decision will be based on the student's prior work, if any, at a regionally accredited institution. Students may submit a request in writing to the Director of Admissions for courses from non-regionally accredited institutions to be accepted for transfer credit; submission of course syllabi and other information will be required. 1. Courses that are remedial, occupational, or vocational in nature are not accepted as transfer credit to USFSM unless specifically determined by the University. In addition, USFSM reserves the right to evaluate courses or deny transfer credit, if not applicable to the degree program. 2. Associate in Arts (AA) degree holders from a Florida public accredited institution will be awarded up to 60 semester hours of credit and recognized as having completed the USFSM's General Education and University Success Requirements. For AA degree holders awarded by an out-of-state or private in-state institution, the USFSM Office of Admissions will conduct a course-by-course transfer credit evaluation. 3. Articulated Associate in Science (AS) degree holders from a Florida public accredited institution will be awarded 60 semester hours of credit toward an approved USFSM BSAS program including credit for appropriate transferable General Education Courses they have completed per Florida's Statewide Articulation 172 Manual. For AS degree holders awarded by an out-of-state or private in-state institution, the USF System institution's designated office will conduct a course-by-course transfer credit evaluation. 4. All courses from a Florida public college or university with the same State Common Course prefix and last three numbers as a USF System course are automatically transferred and the transfer student will not be required to repeat these courses unless a college minimum grade or age-of-record policy is involved. Excluded are graduate courses, studio courses in art, internships, practica and performing arts courses in dance, acting, vocal and instrumental music. 5. Credit is not awarded based on GED test scores. 6. Military service school courses will be evaluated with reference to the recommendations of the American Council of Education (ACE) when official credentials have been presented. However, such recommendations are not binding upon USFSM. 7. For ROTC and military science courses the maximum credit may vary with each college. A student must confer with his/her academic advisor to determine the credit for his/her major. 8. USFSM awards credit-by-examination based on the minimum guidelines as established by the Articulating Coordinating Committee (ACC) available on the FACTS.org website, pursuant to Florida Statute 1007.27(2), and approved by the State Board of Education and Board of Governors. Per USF System Policy 10-017 (Credit by Examination), the USF System will accept a maximum of 45 credit hours earned through any combination of the examinations provided by the Advanced Placement (AP), Advanced International Certificate of Education Program (AICE), International Baccalaureate (IB), College Level Examination Program (CLEP), DANTES/DSST, Excelsior College, CAPE, General Certificate of Education (GCE), German Aibitur, and Global Assessment Certificate (GAC) exams. 9. A maximum of 30 semester hours of extension, correspondence, and military service education credits may be counted for the purposes of meeting transfer admission criteria and applied toward a degree program. 10. Grades earned in transferred courses are included in the student's grade point average for the purposes of admission to limited access programs, awarding of honors at graduation, and class ranking of baccalaureate students but transfer grades are not included in computing the student's grade point average. 11. A degree-seeking student must obtain prior written approval from the college of the student's major for courses taken at another regionally-accredited institution to be applied to the student's degree program. 12. Credit earned from an institution outside of the United States (which is not accredited by an acceptable domestic regional accrediting body) must be reviewed for equivalency on a U.S. scale by one of the credential evaluation services identified on the USFSM website and published by the appropriate international admissions office. 173 Undergraduate Degrees Offered Majors Program College Degree Type Accounting COB B.A, B.S.

Through the mentored experience of writing an undergraduate thesis and discussing it in an academic presentation, honors students have the opportunity to present original arguments with scholarly authority and integrity. Satisfactory completion of the Honors Program is noted on the diploma and the transcript, as well as on a certificate. Undergraduate students in any major, who have a strong academic inclination, are invited to apply to the USFSM Honors Program. The Program may be completed as a Four-year Track or a Two-year Track, as described below. Four-year Track The Four-year Track is designed for students who enter USFSM with less than 30 credits. Students may apply for admission to the Honors Program as they apply to USFSM. Students in the Four-year Honors Track will complete an Honors orientation program in their first semester at USFSM. Following the Honors orientation, students begin their Honors work in their second semester at USFSM by combining a one-credit Honors course (IDH 2930) with a selected course from the USFSM general education curriculum to create an Honors-enriched course. Four-year Honors students must complete at least 3 Honors-enriched courses during their first two years at USFSM to remain in the Honors Program.

Communication courses develop and assess competency in college-level writing skills through multiple assignments. At a minimum, students in Communication courses must write 4500 words that receive instructional feedback that relates to writing effectiveness. At least one assignment must include submission of a revision in response to previous feedback. In such cases both the original draft and the revised draft can count toward the 4500 word minimum. The Communications requirement is met by the following courses: Two courses (6 credits) of English Composition, taken as part of General Education Two courses (6 credits) of additional coursework that require college-level writing skills through multiple assignments. At USFSM General Education Humanities courses fulfill this part of the writing requirements. Computation courses develop and assess competency in college-level mathematics skills. The Computation requirement is met by the following courses: Two courses (6 credits) of approved General Education mathematics coursework. State Communication and Computation Requirement Policies Communication and Computation credit requires earning a course grade of at least C-. Students must maintain a grade point average of at least 2.00 in courses meeting the State Communication and Computation requirement. Students with certain types of disabilities may request test accommodations in State Communication and Computation courses. The State Communication and Computation requirements are considered met for any student entering USFSM with an A.A. from a Florida public institution. The State Communication requirement is considered met for any student entering USFSM with 60 or more semester hours. Students shall receive Communication and Computation credit for specific courses upon entering USFSM in the following situations: o Students awarded college credit in English composition or mathematics at the level of College Algebra or higher, based on having taken a dual enrollment course, Advanced Placement, or International Baccalaureate. o Students who transfer in with Communication and Computation credit, awarded at another public Florida institution. The State Communication and Computation requirement is codified by State Board of Education Rule 6A-10.030/BOG Articulation Resolution (Statewide Articulation Manual). 190 State Communication Courses (6ACM) (12 credits) State Communication requirements are satisfied through the completion of General Education Requirements. Lower-level General Education Communication Courses (ENC 1101 and ENC 1102) and all Lower-level General Education Humanities courses at USFSM are approved for the State Communication requirement. The State Communication requirement should be fulfilled at the lower level; however, all Communication and Critical Thinking Pillars courses have been approved to meet this requirement for transfer students who have already taken a version of the qualifying lower-level courses and thus need another option to meet the State Communication requirement. Please refer to the General Education Requirements and Upper-level Pillars pages for full course listings. State Computation Courses (6AMM) (2 courses, 6 credits) State Computation Requirements are satisfied through the completion of General Education Requirements. Lower-level general education mathematics courses at USFSM are approved for the State Computation requirement. Additionally, any mathematics course with an MAC prefix and number above 1105 qualifies as a State Computation course. Please refer to the General Education Requirements page for full course listings. Upper-Level Pillars At USFSM, students continue to take upper-level courses that develop the Pillars of Intellectual Engagement: communication, critical thinking, leadership, ethics community engagement, and diversity. Students take upper-level Pillars courses when they are classified as juniors, having earned at least 60 credits (exceptions may be made with dean's approval). As juniors and seniors, students have been previously introduced to the Pillar values and competencies and are able to reflect upon them at a more sophisticated level. In the Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Business, and Hospitality & Tourism Leadership, students take three (3) Pillar courses to meet the university's upper-level Pillars requirement. These courses each have two Pillar values and competencies to a field of inquiry: Communication and Critical Thinking This Pillar is addressed in each student's degree capstone course. Leadership and Ethics Depending on a student's degree program offerings, this Pillar requirement may be met within the major or outside of it. Community Engagement and Diversity Depending on a student's degree program offerings, this Pillar requirement may be met within the major or outside of it. In the School of Education, the Pillars are developed and assessed throughout the curriculum, so students do not take specific Pillar courses in addition to their major course of study. Pillars courses are all numbered 3000-4999 and can count toward the required minimum of 48 upper-level credits for a bachelor's degree. Students are required to meet their upper-level Pillar course requirements with USFSM 191 courses; therefore, no transfer credit can be used to satisfy the Pillars requirements. All students must achieve a grade of \"C-\" or better in each of the upper-level Pillar courses. Communication and Critical Thinking Pillar Courses (SMCC) (1 course) Typically, the capstone course in a student's major will count for this requirement. The degree capstones all require advanced competency in communication and critical thinking as students apply and synthesize the learning outcomes that shape their degree. In Communication and Critical Thinking courses, a significant portion of the student's grade is based on assignments that allow students to demonstrate mastery of the following Core Outcomes: 1. Communication: Students will communicate effectively by means of written and/or oral modalities. 2. Critical Thinking: Students will demonstrate the skills necessary to be proficient critical thinkers.

New Student Orientation is an annual program consisting of interactive, engaging presentations and activities intended to help acclimate all first-year students to their new campus community. The program is required for all incoming first-year undergraduate students as a means of transition and preparation for success in the USFSM community. Why is New Student Orientation important? Studies reveal that by increasing the amount of time first-year students have to become familiar with their respective institution, the greater the likelihood they will stay throughout their first year of college. Furthermore, students who actively participate in orientation programs along with other first-year transitional programs are more likely to stay in college, are more satisfied with their overall college experience, have greater academic success, and persist through graduation. What are the BENEFITS of participating in the New Student Orientation? Through the active participation of all first-year students, New Student Orientation: affords opportunities for students to become familiar with the resources available to them at USFSM while establishing greater familiarity with campus building and grounds develops a greater understanding in regards to the interconnected nature of the physical, social/emotional, and environmental aspects of one's self, others, and campus community provides students with useful insights regarding academic, social, and personal challenges clarifies expectations related to college life creates a strong foundation from which every student is able to launch their collegiate career, ensuring persistence through graduation forms friendships that will last a lifetime Transfer Orientation All new transfer students are required to participate in orientation while former students returning to USFSM are encouraged to participate. Orientation at USFSM provides an introduction to USFSM and the USF System and facilitates the smooth transition of students into the academic and social environments of the university. In addition, overviews and requirements for college degree programs, general USF System policies and services, and student activities and campus life are reviewed. Academic advising and registration for classes are part of the orientation process. Transfer students should bring an unofficial or student copy of their transcript(s) at the time of orientation. 196 College of Business Location SMC-C212 Telephone 941-359-4455 Website usfsm.edu/academics/college-of-business/ Advising Student Services SMC-C107 941-359-4330 The College of Business is accredited by The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business - AACSB International for Accounting, Finance, General Business, Management, and Marketing majors.

As researchers, our individual inquiries result in scholarly publications that advance the body of knowledge in our particular fields. As teachers, we instill these scholarly skills, values, and knowledge in our students. As faculty, we lend our skills to meet the needs of the various communities in which we live. Graduates of programs in the CLASS Department of Liberal Arts, the Department of Social Sciences and the School of Education are well prepared for employment or further academic study. Rules & Requirements Admission Requirements Students who have been accepted to USFSM may be admitted to pursue any majors in the Department of Liberal Arts or in the Department of Social Sciences of the College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences (CLASS); however, they must apply for admittance to the CLASS School of Education. At New-student Orientation, students submit a \"declaration of major\" form for degrees of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences, or they submit an \"application to major\" form for a degree in Education (See Elementary Education). 267 General Requirements All CLASS majors must meet the following requirements of the college. Only courses earning credit at or above the minimum grade requirement are credited toward the degree. Any course in which the grade earned is below the program requirement must be retaken; however, the original grade will still affect the GPA unless it is retaken under the grade-forgiveness allowance. Students may use only one directed-study/-research/-readings course (for a maximum of 4 credits) for elective credit in the major; additional directed-study credit may be applied to hours outside the major. Directed-study/-research/-readings courses require a professor's permission and the dean's approval. No S/U credit can be applied to the major, unless S/U is the only grading option for the course. In Liberal Arts and Social Sciences, a maximum of 20 S/U credits are allowed; in School of Education, a maximum of 21 S/U credits are allowed. Requests for S/U grading must be approved by the professor and submitted to the dean by the end of week three of the term. All work for S/U credit is graded. Students should take all \"core\" courses in the major at USFSM unless they have been accepted as transfer credit by the department faculty upon admittance. If the degree requirements allow 5-6 general elective courses outside the major, students are encouraged to use those credits to pursue a minor in another subject area that will be recorded on the transcript. In most cases, minors are composed of 15-18 credits. Graduation Requirements Unless otherwise stipulated below, students in CLASS majors must meet all graduation requirements of USFSM. In addition, CLASS majors must meet the following requirements of the college. Unless otherwise stipulated below, students must earn at least a C (not C-) in all required courses and prerequisites of the major or concentration within a major, minors and certificates.

Degree Type: B.A., B.S. CIP Code 24.0101 Major Code GNS Department Code DEA Degree Website www.usfsm.edu/academics/college-of-liberal-arts-and-social-sciences/ Recognizing that many prospective students have relocated to the Sarasota-Manatee region, USFSM hopes to serve those who have accrued college credit elsewhere and now seek to complete an undergraduate degree in a timely and economical manner. The B.A. or B.S. degree in General Studies is designed to accommodate as much transferred credit as possible while developing a broad base of knowledge and skills for a variety of career applications. Mission The mission for the Bachelor of General Studies major (GNS) is to develop college-level generalized knowledge and competency. Therefore, students pursue three content areas of concentration; competency in effective writing and critical thinking; and conversance in concepts of leadership, ethics, diversity, and civic engagement. This is a \"degree completion\" major intended to serve students who, for a variety of reasons, might not seek or be eligible for any of the other major options at USFSM. The GNS is not intended for currently enrolled USFSM students making satisfactory progress toward degree completion. Intended Learning Outcomes The curriculum for the B.A. or B.S. degree in General Studies develops the ability to do the following: Demonstrate conversance in the essential facts and/or skills of a concentration area, as determined by the discipline faculty. Demonstrate conversance in the essential principles, theories, and/or problems of a concentration area, as determined by the discipline faculty. Think critically in analysis of problems related to the concentration areas. Write analytic argument effectively and correctly. 269 Admissions Requirements In order to be admitted into the Bachelor of General Studies (GNS) program at USFSM, applicants must: Have satisfactorily completed at least 60 credits at a regionally accredited college or university Be in good standing with the most recent former educational institution Meet USFSM general admissions standards for transfer students Be approved for admittance to the GNS program by the dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences (CLASS) Admissions Process After admission to USFSM, meet with the CLASS academic advisor With the advisor, complete the GNS Curriculum Audit Fill out and submit to the advisor a GNS Applicant Profile If currently a USFSM student, submit a letter from your current dean supporting your request to change your major to GNS Policies Students majoring in General Studies must meet all degree requirements of USFSM and CLASS.

The Continuous Improvement Commission of the Council for Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP) granted USFSM NCATE accreditation for both its initial and advanced educator preparation programs. Accreditation affirms we meet the rigorous standards of the professional education community. Our programs have been examined by the best in the field and have passed this test of excellence. NCATE's performance-based accreditation system for educator preparation ensures that education candidates are prepared to make a difference in P-12 student learning. Providers accredited under NCATE standards are now served by the single specialized accreditation system for educator preparation in the United States, the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP). More than 900 educator preparation providers participate in the CAEP accreditation system. Vision The vision of the School of Education (SOE) is to lead in transforming the educational endeavors of our region and to be recognized nationally for excellence in our work. We admit applicants who are highly qualified, developed in their abilities to ensure that all pupils learn, committed to continuous improvement of their own praxis, and prepared to assume leadership roles in the school settings in which they will work. Mission The School of Education's (SOE) mission is to prepare effective educators who will learn, lead, inspire, and transform their schools and communities through critical and imaginative literacies. We see the process of learn, lead, inspire and transform as recursive and not linear. Our mission guides the SOE to prepare educators poised to positively engage in and positively impact individuals and their communities, locally, nationally, and globally. We meet our mission through programs grounded in researched-based practices, critical perspectives, and clinical experiences. Our school and community partnerships form a solid basis for program assessment and continuous improvement. 334 Goals Goal areas of the SOE are in Content Knowledge, Reflective and Ethical Practice, Evaluation and Decision-making, Educational Design, and Learner as an Individual in Community. Faculty, students, staff and members of our community developed the seven candidate proficiencies expected of each of our graduates, which are: 1. Content Knowledge Candidates demonstrate depth and breadth of content knowledge for their respective roles. 2. Reflective and Ethical Practice Candidates engage in reflective and ethical practice as educators. 3. Evaluation and Decision-making Candidates make professional educational decisions drawing on analysis of data and research from a variety of sources 4.

During the New Student Orientation, students receive information about their degree program and register for courses for their first semester. 2. Completion of General Education requirements. 3. Passing scores on a general knowledge exam specified for the major: a. For the major in Elementary Education, which leads to certification to teach in Florida, submission of passing scores on all portions of the General Knowledge Test of the Florida Teacher Certification Exams, within 10 years of application for certification. GRE test administrations conducted on or after July 1, 2015, may be used as an acceptable means of demonstrating a mastery of general knowledge. Passing scores must be in accordance with Rule 6A-4.0021 (12) FAC. b. For the major in Interdisciplinary Education, which does not lead to state certification, EITHER submission of passing scores on all portions of the General Knowledge Test of Florida Teacher Certification Exams OR all portions of the Praxis Core Academic Skills for Educators exam. 4. An overall minimum GPA of 2.50 on all attempted hours. 5. Completion of State-Mandated Common Prerequisites. International Students The program requires field experience or clinical experiences. You will need to obtain a Social Security Number (SSN) in order to complete the requirements for several courses. Obtaining the SSN is the responsibility of the student. Graduation Requirements To graduate with a Bachelor's degree from the School of Education, candidates must meet all General Requirements and Graduation Requirements of CLASS majors as well as the following: 1. Earned a combined grade point average of 2.50 in professional education and specialization as well as an overall USFSM GPA of 2.50 2. Completed all assignments and/or requirements that are required to be uploaded into Taskstream 336 3. Successful completion of all courses and requirements on the Program of Study 4. Submitted all documents for graduation (i.e., test scores, final grades, final transcripts) to Academic Advising (SMC-C107) no later than 5:00 pm on the Friday after the graduation ceremony. If that date is a university holiday, then the said information must be submitted no later than 5:00 pm on the Thursday after the graduation ceremony. Elementary Education majors must also have: 1. Successfully completed all program requirements for ESOL including the ESOL Field Experience Documentation form. 2. Passed the appropriate Florida Teacher Certification Examinations (FTCE): Subject Area Exams and Professional Education Exam. 3. Elementary Education majors must also complete the assignments and/or requirements that are required to be uploaded into Taskstream Students of Concern Policies and Processes The SOE is responsible for ensuring that its students (hereinafter referred to as \"candidates\") exhibit the knowledge, skills and dispositions outlined in the conceptual framework, institutional, state, and national standards, including a commitment to fairness and the belief that all students can learn. Further, as educators our candidates must exhibit the highest ethical standards in their role as moral exemplars in the community. There are occasionally patterns of observed behaviors that could give rise to a concern that a candidate's dispositions and professional deportment are not sufficiently developed or are even inconsistent with those expected of a professional educator. Both the SOE administration and the candidate will be made aware of concerns that a candidate is not meeting the standard of knowledge, skills, or dispositions that are expected by the college and specifically outlined in institutional, state, or national standards. This awareness will be communicated in a manner that is sufficiently formative and allows the candidate to reflect, consider alternatives, and attempt to make any changes necessary consistent with fulfilling their professional career aspirations. The process should be sensitive, transparent, and effective. There are provisions so that the faculty and supervisors who work with the candidate in subsequent semesters are aware of the concerns and the plans developed to address those concerns. There will always be more than one representative of the faculty who agrees that the concerns warrant intervention. This shall be an internal process managed by a small committee of faculty, referred to as the Pre-completion Educator Professional Support Committee (PEPSC). The knowledge, skills, and/or dispositions of concern and plans of action are documented in the committee's files, but do not ordinarily become part of the candidate's academic file. This process in the SOE is complementary to processes already in place in the university (such as those in student affairs, academic probation, etc.) and will focus on the professional preparation of the candidate. 337 Taskstream Taskstream accounts are required of students enrolled in the following School of Education (SOE) degree programs: Bachelor in Elementary Education Master of Teaching Elementary Education Master of Education in Educational Leadership (all concentrations). Taskstream is a web-based electronic data system that provides assessment data to faculty and candidates in order to evaluate progress against professional standards for teachers and leaders in education. These data support approval by the Florida Department of Education and the Council for Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP). Faculty use data from the assessments for continuous program improvement. Accounts should be purchased once the candidate is in a course with a Critical Task (formative or summative, or a Transition Point Project). Formative Tasks (FT) help candidates and faculty monitor progress and identify areas in need of growth; there is no required minimum mean score for FTs, but candidates must upload the Formative Task to Taskstream or earn an Incomplete for the course. Summative Tasks (SCT) evaluate mastery of required knowledge, skills, and/or dispositions and candidates must earn a mean score of 3 or higher on a 5-point scale, or a 2.0 or higher on a 4-point scale to pass the course. In addition to assessments, there might also be forms to complete and upload into Taskstream. Information on how to get and use a Taskstream account is available in the program orientation on Canvas. 338 Majors In this section...

Because of this focus, psychology is relevant to many other areas of study both inside and outside of the social and behavioral sciences. The undergraduate program in Psychology offers the student a well-rounded liberal arts education. In addition, the program provides excellent training for qualified students who wish to pursue graduate work in such disciplines as Clinical, Cognitive and Neural Sciences or Industrial Psychology, Education, Gerontology, Counseling, Management, Medicine, Law, and other human service programs. The undergraduate major emphasizes the breadth of psychology while allowing the student some electives to pursue in-depth a particular aspect of the field. Mission The curriculum for a Psychology degree from USFSM prepares graduates for the many occupations (e.g., human services, community or public relations, administration, and advertising and market research) and post-graduate degree programs open to Psychology majors. By the time our majors are ready to graduate, they are equipped with two vital skill sets. First, our majors are familiar with numerous factors influencing behavior and mental processes, and the interactions between them. These factors range from physiological processes to socio-cultural influences. Second, our majors have developed the critical thinking skills necessary for the consumption, production, and application of psychological research. These skills include writing and familiarity with how ethics apply to psychological research and practice. Our majors will have the opportunity to take a capstone course that allows them to demonstrate these competencies. Intended Learning Outcomes Knowledge and Application: Understand and apply concepts and theories in multiple areas of psychology (e.g. cognitive, perception, physiological, learning, motivation, developmental, abnormal, industrial, social, and personality). Diversity: Recognize the impact of human diversity (gender, race, ethnicity, socio-economic status, sexual orientation, culture, age, religion, disabilities) on behavior and mental processes. Ethics: Demonstrate knowledge of professional ethics in the use of research subjects. 381 Critical Thinking: Ability to critically evaluate various research methods and designs by formulating vital questions; gathering relevant articles; identifying their strengths, weaknesses, and implications for psychological inquiry; and developing an integrative conclusion. Communication: Write effectively by producing work in the APA style and standards. Policies Students majoring in Psychology must meet all degree requirements of USFSM and the CSM, as well as the following: To continue in the program, students must have a GPA of at least 2.00 in PSY 2012, PSY 3204, and PSY 3213. Consistent with USF system policy, a total of 42 upper-level credit hours are required of all undergraduate psychology majors.

The Office of Admissions and Financial Aid, located in C107, work together with the Office of Student Services to support the overall mission of USFSM. 516 Admission Criteria Each applicant to a graduate program at USFSM is required to meet the following minimum requirements: 1. An applicant must have one of the following: a. A bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited institution and satisfying at least one of the following criteria: i. \"B\" average or better in all work attempted while registered as an undergraduate student working for a degree, or ii. \"B\" or better average in all work attempted while registered as an upper division undergraduate student working for a baccalaureate degree. b. A bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited institution and a previous graduate degree from a regionally accredited institution. In cases where an applicant has a bachelor's and a graduate degree at the time of admission, the credentials and GPA of the graduate degree will be the determining factor for admission. c. The equivalent bachelor's and/or graduate degrees from a foreign institution. Bachelor's degrees from institutions in the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) are considered equivalent based on the Bologna Accord. For applicants with a 3-year Bachelor's Degree with less than 120 hours, from Non-Bologna Accord Institutions, a transcript evaluation from a NACES member is required to confirm equivalency. 2. Submission of standardized test scores is at the discretion of the graduate program. Applicants from countries where English is not the official language must also demonstrate proficiency in English by providing acceptable scores on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or International English Language Testing System (IELTS). 3. All specific and additional requirements of the graduate program to which admission is sought (including requirements to submit standardized test scores) consistent with the Statement of Principle. The College Dean must approve any exceptions to these requirements. Additional Requirements of Programs Colleges/programs may require additional application materials, such as resumes, writing samples, or letters of recommendation.

These materials will be forwarded to the appropriate program if sent with the application packet but they do not become part of the applicant's permanent file. Conditional Admission Criteria A college may admit applicants conditionally pending satisfaction of remedial or program requirements. These conditions may include receipt of satisfactory scores on standardized tests, attendance in and satisfactory grade in specific core or remedial courses, etc. It is the responsibility of the college to track the student's satisfactory completion of the conditions and notify Admissions when conditions are met. Failure to satisfy those conditions by the deadline established by the program will result in academic dismissal from the program. The College will coordinate with the Admissions Office. 517 Deferment of Admission Request An applicant's acceptance is granted for the semester and the particular program specified in the official acceptance notification. The applicant must validate that acceptance by enrolling for that semester. Applicants who fail to validate their admission may contact Admissions and request a Deferment of Admission.

Denial of Admission / Appeal for Reconsideration Criteria Applicants denied admission will be given timely notice by email or in writing. Denied applicants who meet the minimum standards may write the College to which they applied within 30 days of the date of denial to request reconsideration. The Appeal for Reconsideration Form request should present additional evidence of potential for academic success at USFSM and contain reasons why reconsideration is warranted. Applicants denied admission to degree programs are eligible to enroll as special (non-degree seeking) students. Non-degree seeking applications can be found on the USFSM website.

The Continuous Improvement Commission of the Council for Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP) granted USFSM NCATE accreditation for both its initial and advanced educator preparation programs. Accreditation affirms we meet the rigorous standards of the professional education community. Our programs have been examined by the best in the field and have passed this test of excellence. NCATE's performance-based accreditation system for educator preparation ensures that education candidates are prepared to make a difference in P-12 student learning. Providers accredited under NCATE standards are now served by the single specialized accreditation system for educator preparation in the United States, the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP). More than 900 educator preparation providers participate in the CAEP accreditation system. Vision The vision of the School of Education (SOE) is to lead in transforming the educational endeavors of our region and to be recognized nationally for excellence in our work. We admit applicants who are highly qualified, developed in their abilities to ensure that all pupils learn, committed to continuous improvement of their own praxis, and prepared to assume leadership roles in the school settings in which they will work. Mission The School of Education's (SOE) mission is to prepare effective educators who will learn, lead, inspire, and transform their schools and communities through critical and imaginative literacies. We see the process of learn, lead, inspire and transform as recursive and not linear. Our mission guides the SOE to prepare educators poised to positively engage in and positively impact individuals and their communities, locally, nationally, and globally. We meet our mission through programs grounded in research-based practices, critical perspectives, and clinical experiences. Our school and community partnerships form a solid basis for program assessment and continuous improvement. 550 Goals Goal areas of the SOE are in content knowledge, reflective and ethical practice, evaluation and decision making, educational design, and the learner as an individual in the community. Faculty, students, staff and members of our community identified the following seven candidate proficiencies expected of each candidate: 1. Content Knowledge Candidates demonstrate depth and breadth of content knowledge for their respective roles. 2. Reflective and Ethical Practice Candidates engage in reflective and ethical practice as educators. 3. Evaluation and Decision Making Candidates make professional educational decisions drawing on analysis of data and research from a variety of sources 4. Educational Design Candidates design educational experiences that result in successful learning. Candidates demonstrate proficiency in educational technology aligned to the NETS-T standards. 5. Learner as an Individual in the Community Candidates construct learning environments that reflect the diversity of experiences, perspectives, and cultures of their students and the larger world. Candidates communicate in ways that demonstrate fairness, respect, and sensitivity to diversity, setting high academic expectations for all students. Additional specific program-based competencies for candidates seeking Florida certification are delineated by the Florida Department of Education. Students of Concern Policies and Processes The SOE is responsible for ensuring that its students (hereinafter referred to as \"candidates\") exhibit the knowledge, skills and dispositions outlined in the conceptual framework, institutional, state, and national standards, including a commitment to fairness and the belief that all students can learn. Further, as educators our candidates must exhibit the highest ethical standards in their role as moral exemplars in the community. There are occasionally patterns of observed behaviors that could give rise to a concern that a candidate's dispositions and professional deportment are not sufficiently developed or are even inconsistent with those expected of a professional educator. Both the SOE administration and the candidate will be made aware of concerns that a candidate is not meeting the standard of knowledge, skills, or dispositions that are expected by the college and specifically outlined in institutional, state, or national standards. This awareness will be communicated in a manner that is sufficiently formative and allows the candidate to reflect, consider alternatives, and attempt to make any changes necessary consistent with fulfilling their professional career aspirations. The process should be sensitive, transparent, and effective. There are provisions so that the faculty and supervisors who work with the candidate in subsequent semesters aware of the concerns and the plans developed to address those concerns. There will always be more than one representative of the faculty who agrees that the concerns warrant intervention. This shall be an internal process managed by a small committee of faculty, referred to as the Pre-completion Educator Professional Support Committee (PEPSC). The knowledge, skills, and/or dispositions of concern and plans of action are documented in the committee's files, but do not ordinarily become part of the candidate's academic file. This process in the SOE is complementary to processes already in place in the university (such as those in student affairs, academic probation, etc.) and will focus on the professional preparation of the candidate. 551 In this section...
