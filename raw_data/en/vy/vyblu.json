Complementary medicine is a treatment, practice, or product that is used alongside conventional medical treatment. It is not meant to replace conventional r treatment but is available to alleviate side effects or improve a patient's sense of well- being. Alternative medicine or alternative therapy is the stream of medicine that exists independently, beyond the domain of conventional medicine. These therapies are called alternative because they may not always be effective or not proved 100% successful. Many of the alternative therapy practices are based on historical or cultural traditions.

There are specific styles of Tai chi that focus in on health maintenance Key Points Find out and consider what scientific studies have been done on the safety and effectiveness of the complementary product or practice that interests you. Discuss the information with your doctor before making a decision. If you are considering a therapy provided by a complementary medicine practitioner, such as acupuncture. choose the practitioner as carefully as you would choose a conventional health care provider. If you are considering a dietary supplement A product that contains vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, enzymes, and/or other ingredients intended to supplement the diet. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has special labeling requirements for dietary supplements and treats them as foods, not drugs. , such as an herbal product, find out about any potential side effects or interactions with medications you may be taking. Complementary products or practices that have not been proven safe and effective should never be used as a replacement for conventional medical treatment or as a reason to postpone seeing a health care provider about any health problem. Tell all your health care providers about any complementary approaches you use. Think twice about chasing the latest headline. Sound health advice is generally based on research over time, not a single study touted by the media. Be wary of results claiming a \"quick fix\" that departs from scientific research and established dietary guidance. More may not be better. Some products can be harmful when consumed in high amounts, for a long time, or in combination with certain other substances. Learn to spot false claims. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Examples of false claims on product labels include: Quick and effective \"cure-all\" Can treat or cure disease \"Totally safe,\" \"all natural,\" and has \"definitely no side effects\" Other red flags include claims about limited availability, offers of \"no- risk, money-back guarantees,\" and requirements for advance payment. The manufacturer of a dietary supplement or dietary ingredient is responsible for ensuring that the product is safe before it is marketed. FDA is responsible for taking action against any unsafe dietary supplement product after it reaches the market. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. (2013).
