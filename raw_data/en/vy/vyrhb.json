This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. We're a unique herbal tea company that grows and wild-crafts the majority of our tea from our own farm on the Tibetan Plateau, known as the \"Roof of the World.\" It's an environment perfect for growing our authentic herbs\u2014a native habitat free of pollution. Different teas have different nuances to brew the perfect cup. Ultimately, it is the consumer who determines their preferred characteristics, but there are a few guidelines to consider. The first is water temperature. Tea leaves are delicate and fragrant, and simply pouring a scalding cup of water over them can be detrimental to their efficacy. We recommend herbal teas to be introduced to water at 212 degrees fahrenheit. There is also generally an ideal length of time to steep your tea; leaving the tea bags in the cup for the duration of the drinking experience can lead to overly bitter flavors. Experiment to find your perfect steeping time. Lastly, the type of water you use can also provide different flavors. Consider tap water versus spring water or carbon filtered water. You may discover each to deliver a difference in flavor profiles. Our teas are not intended to treat or cure any illness or disease, but they can help to maintain and regulate the body. If you have a medical condition, take prescription drugs (including blood thinners or insulin), or are having surgery, consult your healthcare professional prior to incorporating our teas into your daily routine.
