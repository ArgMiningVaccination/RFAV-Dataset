Comments on the report are welcome and can be sent to: Division for Policy Analysis and Public Affairs United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime PO Box 5001400 Vienna Austria Tel: World Drug Report 2017 clearly shows, there is much work to be done to confront the many harms inflicted by drugs, to health, development, peace and security, in all regions of the world. Globally, there are an estimated minimum of 190,000 \u2014 in most cases avoidable \u2014 premature deaths from drugs, the majority attributable to the use of opioids. The terrible impact of drug use on health can also be seen in related cases of HIV, hepatitis and tuberculosis. Much more needs to be done to ensure affordable access to effective scientific evidence-based preven- tion, treatment and care for the people who desperately need them, including those in prison settings. As just one example, this year's report high - lights the need to accelerate accessibility to the treatment of hepatitis C, a disease whose negative health impact on people who use drugs is far greater than that of HIV/AIDS. Recent attention has focused on the threats posed by methamphetamine and new psychoactive sub - stances (NPS). However, as the report shows, the manufacture of both cocaine and opioids is increas - ing. These drugs remain serious concerns, and the opioid crisis shows little sign of stopping. The World Drug Report 2017 further looks at the links with other forms of organized crime, illicit financial flows, corruption and terrorism. It draws on the best available evidence and, most of all, high - lights the fact that much more research needs to be carried out in these areas. Corruption is the great enabler of organized crime, and opportunities for corruption exist at every stage of the drug supply chain. However, too little is known about how different types of corruption interact with drug markets. The outcome document of the special session of the General Assembly on the world drug problem and I am proud to say that this year we are marking 20 years of the World Drug Report. Over the past two decades, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has been at the forefront of global research into complex areas of drug use and supply, supporting international cooperation and informing policy choices with the latest estimates, information on trends and analysis. This year we are launching a new format, with the report available as five separate booklets: the execu - tive summary, together with the report's conclusions and policy implications; a global overview of drug use and supply; a market analysis of plant-based drugs; a market analysis of synthetic drugs; and a thematic booklet on the links between drugs and organized crime, illicit financial flows, corruption and terrorism. We have done this in response to readers' needs and to improve user-friendliness, while maintaining the rigorous standards expected from the Office's flagship publication. The 2017 report comes at a time when the interna - tional community has acted decisively to achieve consensus on a way forward for joint action. The outcome document unanimously adopted at last year's special session of the General Assembly on the world drug problem contains more than 100 concrete recommendations for implementing bal - anced, comprehensive and integrated approaches to effectively addressing and countering the world drug problem. Moreover, at its sixtieth session, in March 2017, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs adopted resolution 60/1, reinforcing commitment to implementing the outcome document and charting a course to the 2019 target date of the 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action on the world drug problem, as well as strengthening action towards the Plan of Action's agreed goals and targets. 4 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2017Security Council resolutions express concern about terrorist groups profiting from drug trafficking, among other forms of transnational organized crime. It is well established that there are terrorists and non-State armed groups profiting from the drug trade \u2014 by some estimates, up to 85 per cent of opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan is in terri- tory under influence of the Taliban. However, evidence on the organized crime-terrorism nexus remains patchy at best. Moreover, these links are not static. Relations between organized crime and terrorists groups are always evolving, much like drug markets themselves. As we have seen with the NPS market, drug use, supply, trafficking routes and the substances them- selves continue to shift and diversify at alarming speed. Drugs continue to represent a major source of rev- enue for organized crime networks, but business models are changing, with criminals exploiting new technologies, such as the darknet, that are altering the nature of the illicit drug trade and the types of players involved, with looser, horizontal networks and smaller groups becoming more significant. New ways of delivering drugs further point to the need to involve other sectors such as postal services in the fight against drug trafficking. Clearly, countries must be able to act and react to an ever-changing and formidable array of threats and problems. UNODC is fully engaged in strength - ening responses, working closely with our United Nations partners and in line with the international drug control conventions, human rights instruments and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which are themselves complementary and mutually reinforcing.As the special session of the General Assembly and the recent session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs have shown, the international community is equipped to respond swiftly and decisively to global drug-related challenges. For example, in March, the Commission scheduled two precursors and an analogue to the scheduled drug fentanyl. This important step will make it harder for criminals to illicitly manufacture fentanyl and its analogues and, I hope, can help to stem the tragic increase in opioid overdoses in recent years. However, there remains an enormous need for capacity-building and technical assistance, and fund- ing continues to fall far short of political commitment. Further resources are urgently needed to help all Member States implement the recom - mendations contained in the outcome document of the special session of the General Assembly and achieve related targets under the Sustainable Devel - opment Goals. The many evolving drug challenges also highlight the importance of prevention \u2014 science- and rights- based drug use prevention \u2014 but also prevention of crime, corruption, terrorism and violent extrem - ism, in line with commitments under the conventions and United Nations standards and norms. Finally, I ask all Governments to help us improve the evidence base for these reports. Areas such as the links between drugs, terrorism and insurgency clearly touch upon sensitive intelligence, and there are legitimate concerns about compromising sources, collection and operations. But if we want to effec- tively address drug challenges we need to strengthen international cooperation and information-sharing to the extent possible, to close the gaps and ensure that joint action is targeted, effective and timely.

Even more worrisome is the fact that about 29.5 million of those drug users, or 0.6 per cent of the global adult population, suffer from drug use disorders. The magnitude of the harm caused by drug use is underlined by the estimated 28 million years of \"healthy\" life (disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)) lost worldwide in 2015 as a result of premature death and disability caused by drug use. Of those years lost, 17 million were attributable solely to drug use disorders across all drug types. DALYs attributable to morbidity and mortality resulting from all causes of drug use have increased overall in the past decade. Yet, with fewer than one in six persons with drug use disorders provided with treatment each year, the availability of and access to science-based services for the treatment of drug use disorders and related conditions remain limited. Opioids, the most harmful drug type Opioids, including heroin, remain the most harmful drug type in health terms. A significant proportion of the large number of premature deaths among people who use drugs is attributable to opioids. In addition, opioid use disorders account for the heaviest burden of disease attributable to drug use disorders: in 2015, almost 12 million DALYs, or 70 per cent of the global burden of disease attributable to drug use disorders, were attributable to opioids. Hepatitis C causing greatest harm among people who use drugs People who inject drugs (PWID) face some of the most severe health consequences associated with drug use. Almost 12 million people worldwide inject drugs, of whom one in eight (1.6 million) are living with HIV and more than half (6.1 million) are living with hepatitis C. The number of deaths attributable to hepatitis C among people who use drugs is greater than from other causes of death related to drug use. Overall, more DALYs are lost as a result of hepatitis C than of HIV infection among people who use drugs. Most of those DALYs are the result of premature death, while the remainder are the result of years lived with disability. People who use drugs particularly vulnerable to tuberculosis Based on the limited data available from studies in Europe, Asia and the Americas, the prevalence of tuberculosis among PWID is estimated at approxi- mately 8 per cent, which compares with less than 0.2 per cent in the general population. People who use drugs may have a particular need for interventions that prevent and treat tuberculosis. They may be disproportionately affected by the risk factors for the disease. Infection with HIV is one of the main reasons for the high prevalence of tuber- culosis among PWID and tuberculosis is one of the leading causes of mortality among people who use drugs and are living with HIV. T reatment of tuberculosis is particularly complex for people who use drugs as they may be living with multiple, co-existing infectious diseases and psychi - atric and medical co-morbidities in addition to drug dependency. Furthermore, many barriers to the pre - vention and treatment of tuberculosis are more difficult to surmount for people who use drugs than for the general population. Prison a high-risk environment for the spread of infectious diseases Drug use, including the use of heroin and injecting drug use, are commonplace in many prisons. One out of three prisoners has used an illicit substance at some time while incarcerated, with 16 per cent reporting current (past-month) use. Cannabis is by far the most commonly used drug in prison, while heroin ranks second. Approximately 10 per cent of prisoners report using heroin at some time while incarcerated, one third of whom report current (past-month) use within prison. Unsafe injecting practices help to spread HIV among PWID in prison populations and ultimately to the KEY FINDINGS 10 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2017wider community. People who use drugs who are incarcerated are also placed at greater risk of tuberculosis. Higher rate of increase in the burden of disease from drug use disorders among women than among men At least twice as many men than women suffer from drug use disorders. However, once women have ini - tiated substance use, in particular, use of alcohol, cannabis, opioids and cocaine, they tend to increase their rate of consumption more rapidly than men. In the past decade, the negative health impact of drug use has increased more rapidly among women than among men. The rate of increase in the number of DALYs attributed to drug use disorders in 2015, particularly opioid and cocaine use disorders, was greater among women (25 per cent and 40 per cent, respectively) than among men (17 per cent and 26 per cent, respectively). Evidence shows that making pharmaceuti- cal opioids available to the population who need them most often does not lead to their misuse or addiction Despite the fact that pharmaceutical opioids for pain management and treatment of opioids use dis - orders are included in the list of essential medicines by WHO, there remain significant gaps and barriers in the access to and availability of pain medications in most parts of the world. Fear of addiction to pharmaceutical opioids contributes to the complex dynamics influencing access to and availability of controlled medicines. However, a structured review of the literature found that 3 per cent of chronic non-cancer pain patients regularly taking opioids developed opioid use disorders. Opioid market in a constant state of change The opioid market is becoming more diversified: this is illustrated by the example of the United States, where the opioid market comprises a combination of internationally controlled substances, particularly heroin, and prescription medicines that are either diverted from the legal market or produced as coun - terfeit medicines on a large scale. These counterfeit medicines are made to look like pharmaceutical products while actually containing fentanyl and fen - tanyl analogues, as well as non-opioid substances such as derivatives of benzodiazepine and methylphenidate. Expansion of the cocaine market Data on drug production, trafficking and use point to an overall expansion of the market for cocaine worldwide. Following a long-term decline, coca bush cultivation increased by 30 per cent during the period 2013-2015, mainly as a result of increased cultivation in Colombia. Total global manufacture of pure cocaine hydrochloride reached 1,125 tons in 2015. The quantities of cocaine seized are also on the increase, reaching a record level of 864 tons in 2015. Opium production on the increase In 2016, global opium production (6,380 tons) increased by one third compared with the previous year. Although there was also an increase in the size of the area under opium poppy cultivation, the major increase in opium production was primarily the result of an improvement in opium poppy yields in Afghanistan compared with the previous year. Global seizures relatively stable The largest quantities of drugs seized were of can- nabis, followed by coca/cocaine related substances and opioids. The sharpest increases in quantities seized over the period 2010-2015 were reported for synthetic NPS, which increased fourfold, and of ATS, which dou- bled. Sharp increases, in particular during 2015, were also reported for cocaine, in line with reports of rising levels of cocaine manufacture. Trafficking through the darknet: relatively small but growing fast The darknet allows users to buy drugs with a crypto- currency, such as bitcoin, and have their purchases delivered to them in a concealed manner. Typical buyers are recreational users of cannabis, \"ecstasy\", cocaine, hallucinogens and NPS. They are less likely to order heroin or methamphetamine. Although the darknet accounts for only a small percentage of drug sales, the market has been growing by around 50 per cent per year in recent years.11INTRODUCTION Although presented as a stand-alone publication, this booklet constitutes the second chapter of the World Drug Report 2017. It provides a global over- view of the latest estimates of and trends in drug use and drug supply, as well as of several cross-cut- ting issues related to the world drug problem. Such issues include the health impact of drug use, includ - ing trends among people with drug use disorders, problem drug use as reflected in treatment demand and estimates of the number of people who inject drugs (PWID) and of those living with HIV and hepatitis. The present booklet also examines the global extent of drug-related deaths, particularly of fatal overdoses, with recent trends in some countries being presented as illustrative.

An analysis of the dynamics of and trends in the misuse of pre - scription opioids is also included, as is a brief discussion of the issues related to making opioid painkillers available and accessible to the population in need of them. Finally, the booklet contains a global overview of the latest estimates of and trends in cultivation, production and trafficking of illicit drugs, including on the Internet, using the darknet.13 2 GLOBAL OVERVIEW OF DRUG DEMAND AND SUPPLY A. Extent of drug useThe number of past-year users of opiates and per- sons who misuse prescription opioids is estimated at about 35.1 million people (range 28.3 million to 42.7 million), of whom some 17.7 million are esti- mated to have used opiates (heroin and opium). The misuse of pharmaceutical opioids remains of concern in many countries, particularly the United States of America, where, coupled with an increase in heroin and fentanyl use, it has resulted in a A. EXTENT OF DRUG USE A quarter of a billion people use drugs globally It is estimated that a quarter of a billion people, or about 5 per cent of the adult population aged 15-64 years, used drugs at least once in 2015 (range: 158 million to 351 million),1 meaning that the extent of drug use among the world population has remained stable over the past five years. Globally, over 11 per cent of people who use drugs, or around 29.5 million people (range: 15.3 million to 43.1 million), are estimated to suffer from drug use dis- orders.This means that their drug use is harmfull to the point that they may experience drug dependence and require treatment. Moreover, the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 estimated that around 17 million \"healthy\" years of life lost (disability- adjusted life years or DALYs)2, 3 were attributable to drug use disorders in that year. Opioids are the substances that cause the highest negative health impact, but cannabis remains the world's most widely used drug, with an annual prevalence of 3.8 per cent of the adult population, or an estimated 183 million people (range 128 million to 238 million), having used cannabis in the past year. Cannabis use has increased in parts of North and South America, while its use is declining or stabilizing in parts of Europe, albeit from or at high levels. Amphetamines remain the second most commonly used drug worldwide, with an estimated 35 million past-year users (range 13 million to 58 million), and the use of amphetamines, particularly methamphetamine, is perceived to be increasing in many subregions, including North America, Oceania and most parts of Asia. 1 These estimates are based on updates by some 25 countries in which new data were available, and reflect the best data currently available on the global extent of drug use. 2 As defined by the Word Health Organization (WHO), one DALY is one lost year of \"healthy\" life. \"Healthy\" years of life lost is the combination of life lost as a result of prema-ture death and life lost as a result of disability (any short-term or long-term health loss). 3 Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 DALYs and HALE Collaborators, \"Global, regional, and national disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 315 diseases and injuries and healthy life expectancy (HALE), 1990-2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015\", The Lancet, vol. 388, No. 10053 (2016), pp. 1603-1658.Fig. 1 Global trends in estimated number of drug users, 2006-2015 Source: UNODC, responses to annual report questionnaire.

The burden of disease is greater for health consequences related to hepatitis C than to HIV infection: considerably more deaths (222,000 from hepatitis C; 60,000 from HIV) and DALYs (6.3 million from hepatitis C; 3.0 million from HIV) are attributable to hepatitis C than to HIV. Most of those DALYs are the result of premature death, while the remainder are the result of years lived with disability. Opioids remain major drugs in terms of health consequences, with nearly 12 million of the total 17 million DALYs attrib - uted to drug use disorders in 2015 being attributed to opioid use disorders.c Opioids also account for the majority of drug- related deaths in many subregions. The overall burden of disease from all causes of drug use increased in the period 2005-2015, with DALYs increasing from 24 million to 28 million, whereas the burden of disease attributed to drug use disorders alone increased from 14 million to 17 million DALYs over the same period. The largest increase in DALYs was attributed to opioid use disorders, but large increases were also attributed to disor - ders resulting from use of amphetamines and use of cocaine. The fact that opioids, including heroin, account for most of the negative health consequences of drug use is also reflected in data provided by hospital emergency departments. In Europe, opioids and heroin are most frequently associated with acute toxicity presentations, with heroin involved in almost one out of four cases. Cocaine and cannabis are also prominent (each accounting for 16 per cent of presentations), with new NPS, mostly synthetic cathinones, and mephedrone in particular, accounting for 11 per cent. Polydrug use presentations are also common in Europe, being involved in 38 per cent of cases.d Number of deaths and \"healthy\" years of life lost (DALYs) attributable to drug use, 2015 Source: \"Global, regional, and national comparative risk assessment of 79 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks, 1990-2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015\".

Extent of drug useProblem drug use as reflected in the demand for drug treatment Information on people in treatment for disorders related to the use of different drugs can be taken as a proxy to understand the nature and extent of prob - lem drug use. However, this is only a latent indicator of trends in the use of drugs, owing to the time lag between the period when people start using drugs, when they develop drug use disorders and when they seek treatment for drug use. For people with drug use disorders, the availability and access to treatment services, particularly of science-based services, remains limited at the global level, with one out of six people with drug-use disorders being provided with treatment each year. On average, among those treated, the proportion of people with cannabis and opioid use disorders remains larger than the proportion of people with disorders related to the use of other substances. It is important to understand, however, that there is great variability in the definition and practice of what constitutes treatment of cannabis use disorders. At present, such treatment consists of behavioural or psychosocial interventions that may vary from a combined and interrelated epidemic and an increase in morbidity and mortality related to opioids.4 There are also indications of a recent increase in heroin use in parts of Western and Central Europe, suggesting that the long-term downward trend in parts of that subregion may be coming to an end. With a high prevalence of cocaine use in North America (1.8 per cent, Western and Central Europe (1.1 per cent) and Oceania (1.5 per cent, primarily Australia and New Zealand), it is estimated that there are nearly 17 million past-year users of cocaine worldwide. Although cocaine use is decreasing or stabilizing in parts of Europe, wastewater analysis suggests an increase in consumption of the drug in the past five years (see booklet 3, chapter B). There are also indications of an increase in parts of North America. Some 21.6 million people are estimated to be past-year users of \"ecstasy\", the use of which remains high in Oceania (primarily Australia and New Zealand), Europe and North America. \"Ecstasy\" use had been declining in Western and Central Europe, but since 2013, data from many European countries, particularly in Western and Central Europe, show an increase in its use. Many drug users, both occasional and regular, tend to be polydrug users. In order to enhance the overall psychoactive experience of the drugs taken, they use more than one substance concurrently or sequen- tially to experience a cumulative or synergistic effect, making the entire drug-use scenario rather compli- cated. In many subregions, for example, an increasingly complex relationship between the use of heroin and synthetic opioids is being observed, in which the illicit manufacture of opioids and the availability of many \"research opioids\", such U-47700, AH-21, MT-45 and many analogues of fentanyl, are posing serious public health concerns. Moreover, the emergence of syn - thetic stimulants and new psychoactive substances (NPS) and their use in lieu of, or in combination with, conventional drugs, are presenting additional challenges to health professionals responding to drug use-related emergencies and treating people with drug use disorders. 4 Wilson M.

At the global level, men are three times more likely than women to use can - nabis, cocaine or amphetamines. By contrast, women are more likely than men to misuse prescription drugs, particularly prescription opioids and tranquillizers.a, b This mainly reflects differences in opportunities to use drugs owing to the influence of social or cultural environments, rather than intrinsic gender vulnerability.c Women typi- cally begin using substances later in life than men, but once they have initiated substance use, women tend to increase their rate of consumption of alcohol, cannabis, opioids and cocaine more rapidly than men and may progress more quickly than men to the development of drug use disorders. According to the Global Burden of Disease Study, men suffer at least twice as much as women from drug use disorders and therefore from the consequences of drug use, as expressed in DALYs. Between 2005 and 2015, DALYs attributed to drug use disorders increased by 24 per cent,d which is attributed to an increase in expo - sure to risk, i.e. an increase in the prevalence of drug use disorders, coupled with an increase in the popula-tion. The relative increase in the prevalence of drug use disorders (exposure to risk factors) was higher among women than among men in this period.e Similarly, the per cent increase in DALYs caused by drug use disor - ders, particularly opioid and cocaine use disorders, was greater among women (25 per cent and 40 per cent, respectively) than among men (17 per cent and 26 per cent, respectively). \"Healthy\" years of life lost (DALYs) attributable to drug use disorders among men and women, 2005 and 2015 Source: Global Burden of Disease Data, Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. a World Drug Report 2015 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.15.XI.6). b Christine E.

Extent of drug usetreatment are still receiving treatment for opioid use disorders. Cannabis is the main drug for which drug use treatment is sought in Africa, but many coun- tries, most notably Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa and the United Republic of Tanzania, have reported an increasing number of people entering treatment for opioid use disorders. Information on the number of people in treatment for drug use disorders for the first time shows an increasing trend in opioid use, including heroin, in North and South America, as well as in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, where nearly a third of people in treatment for opioid use disorders were first-time entrants into treatment. Accounting for more than half of those treated, the proportion of people seeking treatment for cannabis use disorders for the first time remains high at the global level. Although, overall, nearly one out of three people in treatment for the use of tranquillizers and sedatives is a woman, women account for only one out of five people in treatment for drug use disorders. Younger people are seeking treatment for disorders related to the use of cannabis and amphetamines (with an average age of 24 and 25, respectively) more than for other substances, reflecting increasing use of can - nabis and amphetamines. Meanwhile, people in treatment for opioid- or cocaine-related disorders are typically in their 30s and, in many subregions, reflect an ageing cohort of users in treatment. It should be borne in mind, however, that between 40 one-time online contact, or a brief intervention in an outpatient setting, to a more comprehensive treatment plan involving the treatment of other co-morbidities in an outpatient or inpatient setting.5, 6, 7, 8 Opioids remain of major concern in South-West and Central Asia and in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe. In South-Eastern Europe, nearly three out of every five people in drug treatment are in treat- ment for opioid use disorders. T reatment for cocaine use remains prominent in North America, Latin America and the Caribbean and, to a lesser extent, in Western and Central Europe, while ampheta - mines remain a problem primarily in East and South-East Asia and to some extent in North Amer - ica. The number of people in treatment for disorders resulting from use of amphetamines has been increasing in Asia, although half of people in 5 Wayne Hall, Maria Renstr\u00f6m and Vladimir Poznyak, eds., The Health and Social Effects of Nonmedical Cannabis Use (Geneva, WHO, 2016). 6 Jan Copeland, Amie Frewen and Kathryn Elkins, Manage-ment of Cannabis Use Disorder and Related Issues: A Clini-cian's Guide (Sydney, National Cannabis Prevention and Information Centre, University of New South Wales, 2009). 7 Divya Ramesh and Margaret Haney, \"T reatment of cannabis use disorders\", T extbook I, Nady El-Guebaly, Giuseppe Carr\u00e0 and Marc Galanter, eds.

Health impact of drug useHIV and hepatitis markedly impact on people who inject drugs PWID are a key population at increased risk of HIV infection as a result of unsafe injecting practices relating to the sharing of contaminated needles and syringes. The available data are sparse but suggest that, globally, new HIV infections among PWID climbed from an estimated 114,000 in 2011 to 152,000 in 2015.13 The joint UNODC/WHO/ UNAIDS/World Bank estimate for the prevalence of HIV among PWID in 2015 is 13.1 per cent. This suggests that roughly one in eight people who injected drugs in 2015 were living with HIV, which equates to 1.55 million PWID infected with HIV worldwide. This estimate is based on the reporting of HIV prevalence by 118 countries, covering 95 per cent of estimated PWID. By far the highest prevalences of HIV among PWID are found in South-West Asia (28.5 per cent) and Eastern and South-Eastern Europe (24.0 per cent), where rates are approximately twice the global aver - age (13.1 per cent). Together, China, Pakistan, the Russian Federation, Ukraine and the United States are home to one in three adults worldwide. How- ever, the same five countries account for 68 per cent of PWID living with HIV. Despite the steady decline observed in the numbers of PWID in drug dependence treatment institutions (registered drug users) in the Russian Federation, the prevalence of HIV among registered PWID rose steadily over the period 2009-2014, from 13.2 per cent to 19.9 per cent.14 Hepatitis C is an infectious disease affecting the liver, which is responsible for considerable mortality and morbidity among PWID. The burden of disease among PWID, including people with a past history of injecting drug use (important because the health consequences might not be seen for many decades after initial infection), is far greater for hepatitis C than HIV infection. The number of deaths is more than 3.5 times higher for hepatitis C and the number of years of \"healthy\" life lost (as measured by DALYs) 13 UNAIDS, Get on the Fast-Track: The Life-cycle Approach to HIV (Geneva, 2016). 14 Russian Federation, Ministry of Health, Main Indicators of Substance Abuse Services in the Russian Federation in 2013-2014: Statistical Yearbook (Moscow, 2016).B. HEALTH IMPACT OF DRUG USE Almost 12 million people worldwide injected drugs in 2015 People who inject drugs (PWID) are among the most marginalized and disadvantaged drug users. They experience poor health outcomes with a greater chance of premature death, high rates of potentially life-threatening infectious diseases, such as HIV, hepatitis and tuberculosis, and increased risk of both fatal and non-fatal drug overdoses.9, 10 The situation is often made worse by a lack of access to relevant evidence-based prevention and treatment services for drug dependence and infectious diseases.11, 12 Infectious diseases acquired through the sharing of injection equipment for drug use further impact on those who do not inject or use drugs through other modes of transmission (for example, sexual). The joint UNODC/World Health Organization (WHO)/Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/ AIDS (UNAIDS)/World Bank estimate for the number of people worldwide who injected drugs in 2015 is 11.8 million (range: 8.6 to 17.4 million), corresponding to 0.25 per cent (range: 0.18 to 0.36 per cent) of the population aged 15-64 years. This estimate is based on the reporting of injecting drug use from 107 countries, covering 89 per cent of the global population aged 15-64 years. Subregions where the prevalence of injecting drug use is above the global average are Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, Central Asia and T ranscau- casia, North America, Oceania and South-West Asia. More than half (53 per cent) of PWID worldwide reside in just four countries (China, Pakistan, Rus- sian Federation and United States). 9 Bradley M.

New, highly effective hepatitis C treatments (direct- acting antivirals) have been shown to cure 90 to 95 per cent of chronic hepatitis in 12 or 24 weeks. In 2015, WHO included direct-acting antivirals in its Model List of Essential Medicines18 and, in 2016, launched the first global strategy on hepatitis.19 Despite the high burden of hepatitis C among PWID, treatment has occurred at very low levels, which is related to the substantial barriers that exist for PWID in accessing care.20 These include lack of awareness, stigma and discrimination, limited access to hepatitis C testing and treatment and the cost of the medications. The median cost of a 18 Model List of Essential Medicines: 19th List (Geneva, April 2015) (amended November 2015). 19 Global Health Sector Strategy on Viral Hepatitis 2016-2021: Towards ending viral hepatitis (Geneva, 2016). 20 Philip Bruggmann and Jason Grebely, \"Prevention, treat-ment and care of hepatitis C virus infection among people who inject drugs\", International Journal of Drug Policy, vol. 26 (2015), pp. S22-S26.is approximately 2.5 times higher. The vast majority of DALYs for both hepatitis C and HIV are the result of years of life lost as a result of premature death.15 Hepatitis C is highly prevalent among PWID, with the joint UNODC/WHO/UNAIDS/ World Bank estimate of 51.5 per cent for 2015, suggesting that 6.1 million PWID are infected with hepatitis C. For PWID living with HIV, co-infection with hepatitis C is highly prevalent, at 82.4 per cent, with hepatitis C among those living with HIV becoming a major cause of morbidity and mortali- ty.16 The prevalence of hepatitis B17 among PWID 15 Louisa Degenhardt and others, \"Estimating the burden of disease attributable to injecting drug use as a risk factor for HIV, hepatitis C, and hepatitis B: findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013\", The Lancet Infectious Diseases, vol. 16, No. 12 (2016), pp. 1385-1398. 16 Lucy Platt and others, \"Prevalence and burden of HCV co-infection in people living with HIV: a global systematic review and meta-analysis\", Lancet Infectious Diseases, vol. 16, No. 7 (2016), pp. 797-808. 17 The hepatitis B prevalence estimate is intended to refer to active infection (HBsAg), rather than anti-HBc, which indi-cates previous exposure. However, it is not always possible to differentiate that in the data reported to UNODC.

Health impact of drug usepossible consequence of drug use. Ending the global epidemic of tuberculosis is part of target 3.3. of the Sustainable Development Goals and is the aim of the WHO End T uberculosis Strategy. However, evi- dence is required to understand how policy on drug use can be an inclusive and integral part of the efforts to achieve that goal. T uberculosis is a potentially life-threatening infectious disease that is spread from person to person by breathing the same air as those with active tuberculosis, particularly when they cough, sneeze or spit. Despite being preventable and curable in most cases, tuberculosis is one of the top ten causes of death globally, and more people died from tuberculosis in 2015 than from HIV/AIDS. T uberculosis is one of the leading causes of mortal- ity among people who use drugs and are living with HIV.23 One of the high-risk groups for the spread of tuberculosis are people who use drugs. Based on the limited data available from studies in Europe, Asia and the Americas,24 the prevalence of tuber - culosis among PWID is estimated at approximately 8 per cent (median prevalence based on 23 studies) with a range from 0.2 per cent to 66 per cent. The prevalence of tuberculosis in the general population at the global level is estimated at less than 0.2 per cent.25 People who use drugs are disproportionately affected by risk factors for tuberculosis such as poor social circumstances, infection with HIV and periods of incarceration. People who use drugs are often socio - economically disadvantaged and vulnerable to poverty, homelessness and malnutrition. Infection with HIV is particularly serious because HIV dra- matically increases the chance of latent tuberculosis infection progressing to active tuberculosis.26 Infec - tion with HIV is a major reason for the high prevalence of tuberculosis among PWID.27 Without 23 WHO, Global Tuberculosis Report 2016 (Geneva, 2016). 24 Pippa Grenfell and others, \"T uberculosis, injecting drug use and integrated HIV-TB care: A review of the literature\", Drug and Alcohol Dependence, vol. 129, No. 3 (2013), pp. 180-209, supplemented by responses to annual report ques-tionnaire. 25 WHO, Global Tuberculosis Report 2015 (Geneva, 2015). 26 Helen McShane, \"Co-infection with HIV and TB: double trouble\", International Journal of STD and AIDS, vol. 16, No. 2 (2005), pp. 95-101. 27 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and EMCDDA, Prevention and control of infectious diseases among people who inject drugs.

Some examples where action has been taken include Australia, which, since March 2016, has offered universal access to hepatitis C treatment and has identified prisoners and PWID as priority populations for the expansion of cover- age of treatment. France has been providing universal access to hepatitis C treatment under its national health insurance system since September 2016. Georgia and Morocco have launched hepatitis C elimination programmes, and Portugal announced universal access to hepatitis C treatment in 2015.22 Drug use and tuberculosis In previous World Drug Reports, limited attention had been devoted to tuberculosis, despite it being a 21 Swathi Iyengar and others, \"Prices, costs, and affordability of new medicines for hepatitis C in 30 countries: an economic analysis\", Plos Medicine, vol. 13, No. 5 (2016), pp. 1-22. 22 WHO, Global Report on Access to Hepatitis C Treatment: Focus on Overcoming Barriers (Geneva, 2016).

Although newly diagnosed cases of tuberculosis are declining slightly at the global level, one of the major threats and challenges to controlling the disease is the development and spread of tuberculosis that is resistant to the most effective medications used to cure the disease.30, 31 Drug resistance continues to emerge and spread as a result of mismanagement of tuberculosis treatment, including inadequate com- pliance with evidence-based treatment and poor 28 Emilia Vynnycky and Paul E.

They do not feel sick or have any symptoms, and they cannot spread the disease. Latent tuberculosis infection can be treated but, without treatment, it may progress to active tuberculosis, particularly among individuals with weak immune systems. Latent tuberculosis infec - tion (which represents a pool of potential cases of active tuberculosis) and active tuberculosis are more prevalent among people who use drugs than among the general population.a, b a Robert G.

Drug use, including the use of heroin and injecting drug use, occurs in many prisons, which are an environment where the prevalence of HIV is higher than among the general population. Data on the prevalence of HIV among PWID in prison are scarce. Based on 34 studies in 16 countries identified in a systematic review,b covering the period 2005-2015, the unweighted mean prevalence of HIV among PWID in prison was 12.9 per cent. However, more than half of the studies were from just three countries (Australia, Iran (Islamic Republic of) and United States). Of the 34 studies, 4 reported a prevalence of HIV among PWID in prison of greater than 40 per cent; 6 studies reported a prevalence of greater than 20 per cent; 11 studies reported a prevalence of greater than 15 per cent. Overall, 16 studies reported a prevalence of greater than 10 per cent, while the remaining 18 studies reported a prevalence of below 10 per cent. Data on the prevalence of HIV in prison populations in general are more readily available. People in prisons are five times more likely to be living with HIV than adults in the general popula- tion.c Overrepresentation of PWID among prison populations contributes to HIV prevalence in prisons, particularly in countries where the HIV epidemic in communities is largely driven by injecting drug use.d Globally, an estimated 3.8 per cent (3.2 per cent to 4.5 per cent) of prisoners are living with HIV.b In all subregions, the prevalence of HIV is higher in prisons than in the wider community, especially in certain subregions in Africa and in Europe and Central Asia (as shown in the figure below), where the prevalence of HIV is highest in prison populations (8-16 per cent and 4- 5 per cent, respectively). People who use drugs often continue to do so while incarcer - ated, and other prisoners may initiate drug use or injecting while in prison. Globally, an estimated one in three prisoners have used an illicit substance at some point while incarcerated (median lifetime prevalence of 32.6 per cent, based on data from 32 studies), with 20.0 per cent reporting use in the past year (median past-year prevalence from 45 studies) and 16.0 per cent reporting current use (median past-month prevalence from 17 studies). Heroin is the second most popular drug (after cannabis), with 9.6 per cent reporting heroin use at some point while incarcerated (median lifetime prevalence from 22 studies) and 3.2 per cent reporting current use (median past-month prev - alence from 18 studies). There is currently limited but increasing evidence of the use of NPS (especially synthetic cannabinoids) within prisons, but at present it is not possible to quantify the extent. Numerous studies have shown that injecting drug use is highly prevalent in many prisons, with the sharing of needles and syringes commonplace.e Unsafe injecting practices in prison, where rates of HIV are high, place PWID at an increased risk of HIV through the use of contaminated needles and syringes.

Health impact of drug useof PWID are incarcerated at some point in their lives.46 Regardless of the offence, the proportion of prisoners reporting a history of drug use has been estimated at 10-48 per cent for men and 30-60 per cent for women.47 The overall higher prevalence of tuberculosis observed in prison populations com - pared with in the general population may be partially attributed to the fact that a high proportion of pris - oners have a history of drug use, and people who use drugs might have a history of higher exposure to the risk factors for tuberculosis and HIV than people in the general population. Compared with the general population, people who use drugs in prison have a higher risk of contracting tuberculosis because of their history of drug use and because they are confined in an environment that puts them at a higher risk of infection. The risk of latent tuberculosis infection and tuberculosis are at least one order of magnitude greater in prisons and 46 The GAP Report 2014. 47 Seena Fazel, Parveen Bains and Helen Doll, \"Substance abuse and dependence in prisoners: a systematic review\", Addiction, vol. 101, No. 2 (2006), pp. 181-191.contribute to the higher prevalence of infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, in prison popula - tions than in the general population. T uberculosis in prisons is a major public health prob - lem, particularly in countries where there is a high incidence of the disease. The tuberculosis notifica- tion rate in prisons ranges from 11 to 81 times higher than in the general population and the situation is worsened by the emergence and spread of drug- resistant tuberculosis.43 Globally, an estimated 2.8 per cent (2.05 per cent to 3.65 per cent) of prisoners have active tuberculosis, with the highest rates in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (4.9 per cent), and East and Southern Africa (5.3 per cent).44 The preva - lence of tuberculosis in European prisons has been estimated to be almost 15 times greater than among the wider community.45 People with drug use prob- lems, such as PWID, often spend time in prison: according to UNAIDS, an estimated 56-90 per cent 43 Stefan Enggist and others, eds., Prisons and Health (Copenhagen, WHO Regional Office for Europe, 2014). 44 Dolan and others, \"Global burden of HIV, viral hepatitis, and tuberculosis in prisoners and detainees\". 45 A.

T reatment of tuberculosis (especially for drug-resis - tant forms) is lengthy and complex. It is even more complex for people who use drugs as they may be living with multiple, concurrent, infectious diseases in addition to drug dependency, requiring a partic - ular effort and an integrated approach to their care.54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59 At least 190,000 mostly preventable drug-related deaths in 2015 Drug-related deaths are the most extreme conse - quence resulting from drug use.

Furthermore, as HIV plays a significant role in the spread of tuberculosis, in prison settings where there is an absence of evidence-based prevention programmes, unsafe injecting practices and the associated risk of HIV (see box on page 24) can substantially increase the chance of acquiring tuberculosis. All those factors can place people who use drugs, especially PWID, at increased risk of tuberculosis while in prison. Almost all of the people who are incarcerated will eventually return to their communities. The health of prisoners will therefore have an impact on the general population. Ultimately, the elevated risk of tuberculosis in prisons is likely to affect the burden of tuberculosis on the general population. In high- income countries, it has been estimated that 8.5 per cent (1 in every 11 cases) of tuberculosis in the gen - eral population is attributable to exposure in prisons. For low- and middle-income countries, the corre- sponding proportion is 6.3 per cent (1 in every 16 cases).49 Challenges in treating tuberculosis among people who use drugs Access to quality treatment and adherence to the schedule and completion of treatment are impera- tive to cure and prevent the development of drug-resistant tuberculosis and avoid the further spread of the disease to others. Awareness of the risks of tuberculosis and the treatment options that are available may be low among people who use drugs. Certain barriers to care are typically experi- enced by some people who use drugs, such as the fear of reprisal by authorities and the stigmatization of drug use. These factors can lead to a delay in people seeking treatment, even when they have symptoms, and could limit access to or result in the underutilization of tuberculosis, HIV and health 48 Iacopo Baussano and others, \"T uberculosis Incidence in Prisons: A Systematic Review\", PLoS Medicine, vol. 7, No. 12 (2010). 49 Ibid.27 2 GLOBAL OVERVIEW OF DRUG DEMAND AND SUPPLY B. Health impact of drug useto drug use. In that study, the deaths attributable to drug use disorders alone (170,000) match most closely those presented by UNODC as being mostly related to overdose. In addition, the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 presents deaths related to HIV and hepatitis C as well as other causes that are mostly omitted from UNODC reporting. At more than four times the global average, North America continues to experience the highest drug- related mortality rate, with the subregion accounting for more than one in four drug-related deaths glob - ally. Oceania (based on data from Australia and New Zealand only) also has a high drug-related mortality rate, at more than 2.5 times the global average. A large number of drug-related deaths (35 per cent of the global total) are estimated to occur in Asia, although this number is tentative because of poor regional coverage and reporting of mortality data. Despite the large number of deaths, the drug-related mortality rate in Asia is below the global average. Because of differences in reporting, comparisons across countries and regions should be made with the greatest of care.AIDS and hepatitis C acquired through injecting drug use; behavioural disorders caused by use of psychoactive substances; intentional self-harm and self-poisoning (suicide) by exposure to psychotropic substances; and unintentional deaths and trauma resulting from drug use (motor vehicle accidents and other forms of accidental deaths). Globally, UNODC estimates that there were 190,900 (range: 115,900 to 230,100) drug-related deaths in 2015, or 39.6 (range: 24.0 to 47.7) deaths per million people aged 15-64 years. This is based on the reporting of drug-related deaths by 86 coun - tries. Given differences in the definition and reporting of drug-related deaths by Member States that often only report on overdose deaths to UNODC, and the difficulty in categorically ascer- taining that a death is in fact drug-related, this global estimate is most likely an underestimate of all deaths that could be attributable to drug use.60 The deaths from all causes of morbidity and mortality from drug use, as presented by the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015, take into account most of the causes of death that could be attributable 60 World Drug Report 2016 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.16.XI.7).Fig. 10 Regional variation in drug-related deaths, 2015 Sources: Responses to the annual report questionnaire; Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission; and Louisa Degenhardt and others, \"Illicit drug use\", in Comparative Quantification of Health Risks: Global and Regional Burden of Disease Attributable to Selected Major Risk Factors, vol. 1, Majid Ezzati and others, eds.

However, this masks the concern in several countries in North America and Europe (where there are large numbers of drug-related deaths) that 2015 was a year in which new record levels of drug-related deaths occurred. Opioids were the drug type most often implicated in the rising numbers of deaths in those countries, and they remain the drug type asso - ciated with most overdose deaths in many countries, although the specific opioid substance may change across countries and over time. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, for example, opium used to be the drug most associated with overdoses, although the number of such overdoses has now declined and, following recent increases, overdoses involving meth- adone are now more common (combining methadone with other drugs, such as benzodiaz - epines and/or alcohol, drastically increases the risk of fatal overdose). 61, 62 In the United States, where approximately one quar - ter of estimated global drug-related deaths are recorded, overdose deaths continue to rise.63 Mostly driven by opioids, overdose deaths more than tripled in the period 1999-2015 and increased by 11.4 per cent in the past year alone, to reach the highest level ever recorded. Recent increases in opioid overdoses since 2011 are mostly driven by heroin and synthetic opioids other than methadone (a category domi - nated by fentanyl-related overdoses). Between 2012 and 2015, overdose deaths from synthetic opioids other than methadone increased by 265 per cent, and between 2014 and 2015 by 72 per cent (most likely driven by illicit fentanyl); in the case of heroin overdose deaths, the corresponding increases were 119 per cent and 23 per cent over those two periods.

Pharmaceutical opioidsinvolving heroin and/or morphine have doubled over the past three years to reach their highest levels, partly driven by increases in heroin purity and avail - ability, and also because the ageing cohort of heroin users have a range of medical conditions resulting from long-term drug use, making them particularly vulnerable. Deaths involving cocaine, amphetamine (including \"ecstasy\") and NPS (most commonly mephedrone) also reached an all-time high. Simi - larly, 706 deaths related to drug misuse were registered in Scotland in 2015, which was 15 per cent higher than in 2014 and the largest number recorded since comparable records began, in 1996.70 Opioids (including heroin/morphine and metha - done) were implicated in, or potentially contributed to, 606 of those deaths (86 per cent). C. PHARMACEUTICAL OPIOIDS Pharmaceutical opioids71 are used effectively in the management of acute and chronic pain resulting from different conditions and for the treatment of opioid use disorders.72, 73, 74 The need for pain management can vary from post-surgical care to palliative therapy for people with cancer and chronic conditions.75 Palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing problems associated with life- threatening illness through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification, assessment and treatment of pain and other related problems.76 70 National Records of Scotland, Drug-related deaths in Scotland in 2015 (Edinburgh, 17 August 2016). 71 In this section, the terms \"pharmaceutical opioids\", \"pre- scription opioids\" \"Clinical pharmacology of opioids for pain\", Clinical Journal of Pain, vol. 18, No. 4 (2002), pp. S3-S13. 73 Howard B.

Connor and deaths from prescription opioids), although still at a high level, have stabilized over the past four years, possibly because of changes in policy and changes in the health system, including the review of the prescription monitoring programme and prescrib- ing guidelines. Cocaine overdoses have also increased recently, largely as a result of the involvement of an opioid (mainly fentanyl), with overdoses from this drug combination more than doubling since 1999. In British Colombia, Canada, the overdose death rate (285 per million population aged 15-64 years)64 is even higher than in the United States (246 per million aged 15-64 years), with 914 overdose deaths in the province in 2016. That was by far the highest number ever recorded, representing an increase of 79 per cent from 2015 (when there were 510 deaths) and a 240 per cent increase from 2012 (when there were 269 deaths). Deaths related to the use of fen- tanyl largely account for the increase observed in overdose deaths since 2012.65 The United Kingdom of Great Britain and North-ern Ireland accounts for a large proportion (36 per cent) of the total number of reported overdose deaths that occur in Europe. 66 In England and Wales, the highest mortality rate from drug misuse67 since comparable records began in 1993 was recorded in 2015, when there were 2,479 deaths, an increase of 10.3 per cent from 2014.68, 69 Deaths 64 Calculation based on the population aged 15-64 in Brit- ish Columbia in 2016 of 3,209,661 (British Columbia Statistics, People, Population and Community, Population Estimates).

A structured review of 67 studies found that 3 per cent of chronic non-cancer pain patients regularly taking opioids developed opioid use disorders.83 Research has also shown that the factors that have been associated with increased risk of misuse leading to addiction to prescription opioids among patients include young age, a history of substance use disorder, major depression and the use of other medications, such as benzodiazepines.84, 85, 86, 87 Preventing diversion of prescription opioids within long-term opioid agonist treatment programmes Although a valid concern, the diversion of prescrip- tion opioids, including within long-term opioid agonist treatment programmes, can be addressed through implementing a set of recommended strate - gies.

Thomas McLellan, \"Opioid abuse in chronic pain: misconceptions and mitigation strategies\", The New England Journal of Medicine, vol. 374, No. 13 (March 2016), pp. 1253-1263.Despite the fact that controlled medicines for pain relief and for the treatment of opioid use disorders are included in the WHO List of Essential Medicines, access to them is very limited. It is estimated that, each year, millions of people with terminal cancer, end-stage AIDS, severe injuries caused by accident, women in labour, paediatric patients, people recovering from surgery and patients with chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular or respiratory diseases and diabetes are subjected to untreated or undertreated moderate to severe pain.77 There is strong evidence regarding the efficacy of treatment of opioid dependence with long-acting opioid agonists (opioid substitution therapy). Such treatment can significantly reduce opioid and other drug use, criminal activity, HIV risk behaviours and transmissions, opioid overdose and all-cause mortality, in addition to helping retain people in treatment, including antiretroviral therapy and tuberculosis treatment.78 Access to pain medication: key issues and considerations In spite of the need for pharmaceutical opioids for the management of different conditions, in most parts of the world there remain significant disparities in the availability of and access to pain medication for improving the quality of life of people suffering from those conditions. In 2014, the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) conducted a survey on countries' policies and practices for ensuring the availability of narcotic drugs for medical and scientific purposes.79 The three major areas identified as impediments to the availability of and access to pain medications were lack of training or awareness among medical professionals, fear of addiction and limited resources. Many other interlinked factors, such as fear of diversion, fear of prosecution, onerous regulatory frameworks or sanctions and control measures, and social and Mar\u00eda C. Sepulveda Bermedo, eds.

Pharmaceutical opioidsinterventions, including cognitive and behavioural approaches and contingency management tech - niques, along with medically assisted treatment of opioid use disorders, were found to be the most effective. Misuse of prescription opioids In the past two decades, concerns about the misuse of opioids and its related harms have been increas- ing. Those concerns include dependence and fatal and non-fatal overdose resulting from the misuse of opioids, particularly in combination with other sub - stances such as benzodiazepines. High levels of misuse of prescription opioids have been seen in countries such as Australia and the United States, where there is easy access to and some of the high- est per-capita consumption of opioids for medical purposes.89 However, making prescription opioids available does not necessarily lead to their misuse and addiction. The opposite is also true: some coun- tries have limits or restrictions on the availability and accessibility of opioid painkillers and have low per-capita consumption of opioids for medical pur - poses yet have high levels of misuse of such substances.90, 91 Are the dynamics of the misuse of pre- scription opioids the same in all regions? Available literature suggests that the dynamics of the misuse of prescription opioids remain different in different countries and regions. In North Amer- ica, the increase in the misuse of prescription opioids has been attributed in part to the organization of the health system's structures for regulation and access control, prescription practices, dispensing and medical culture and patient expectations.92 The misuse of prescription opioids in Europe is 89 E/INCB/2015/1/Supp.1. 90 World Drug Report 2014 (United Nations Publication, sales No. E.14.XI.7). 91 Louisa Degenhardt and others, Benefits and Risks of Pharma-ceutical Opioids: Essential Treatment and Diverted Medication - A Global Review of Availability, Extra-Medical Use, Injec-tion and the Association with HIV (Sydney, National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales, 2007). 92 Bendikt Fischer and others, \"Non-medical use of prescrip-tion opioids and prescription opioid-related harms: why so markedly higher in North America compared to the rest of the world?\", Addiction, vol. 109, No. 2 (February 2014), pp. 177-181.literature identified 37 highly relevant sources of evidence on effective strategies to prevent the diver - sion of prescription opioids in opioid dependence treatment programmes.88 Experts were asked to review that evidence and, based on their clinical experience, rank the list of strategies with high impact, which was defined as effectiveness in pre - venting diversion and ease of implementation. Based on the study findings, eight strategies were found to have a high impact on preventing the diversion of prescription opioids in opioid dependence treatment programmes. Those measures included: (a) supervis - ing consumption among those patients most likely to misuse or divert, while providing extended take- home medications only for patients when their dosage and social situation are stable and who accept abuse deterrent formulations; and (b) restricting take-home formulations that could put children at risk through unintentional exposure. Formulations that make opioids harder to misuse, particularly in the case of opioids that are prone to be injected, can be applied in different ways. Such formulations can either have a mechanical deterrence, such as being crush proof, or contain the addition of an opioid antagonist such as naltrexone, to limit misuse and diversion. Finally, increasing training for health-care practitioners and combining psychosocial 88 Wright and others, \"Addressing misuse and diversion prescribed for the relief of severe pain, other opioids such as oxycodone and oxymor - phone could be prescribed for the management of severe to moderate pain. Fentanyl is used for the management of post-op - erative pain by intravenous and epidural routes of administration. Transdermal patches are used for chronic pain, whereas transmucosal dosage is used for breakthrough cancer pain. Opioids such as buprenorphine and methadone are also used for the management and treatment of opioid use disorders. 32 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2017resulted in a 2.9 per cent increase in the number of hospitalizations for heroin overdose.99 Current heroin users are also more likely to have used pre- scription opioids and then switched to heroin use.100, 101 Available data suggest that the non-med - ical use of prescription opioids is neither necessary nor sufficient for the initiation of heroin use, and other factors could have contributed to the increase in heroin use and related mortality.102 In 2015, an estimated 828,000 people aged 12 years or older used heroin in the United States and over 12 million people misused prescription opioids.103 99 George Unick and others, \"The relationship between US heroin market dynamics and heroin-related overdose, 1992-2008\", Addiction, vol. 109, No. 11 (November 2014), pp. 1889-1898. 100 For details see World Drug Report 2016. 101 Andrew Kolodny and others, \"The prescription opioid and heroin crisis: a public health approach to an epidemic of addiction\", Annual Review of Public Health, vol. 36 (March 2015), pp. 559-574. 102 Compton and others, \"Relationship between nonmedical prescription-opioid use and heroin use\". 103 According to the United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, misuse of prescription drugs is defined as: use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own medica-considered to have been shaped by the response to the opiate problem, in which the misuse of prescrip - tion opioids, many of which are either diverted from legal sources or manufactured illicitly, is seen pri - marily in the context of legal alternatives to heroin.93 In middle-income or developing countries, the misuse of prescription opioids seems to occur in an environment of health-care systems, including the systems for the monitoring and dispensing of pre- scription opioids, that are neither well developed nor regulated, coupled with the wider availability of counterfeit or illicitly manufactured or trafficked prescription opioids to meet the demand for the misuse of substances.94, 95 Use of prescription opioids and heroin in the United States The United States is currently experiencing com - bined and interrelated opioid epidemics of prescription opioids and heroin.96 The increase in the misuse of prescriptions opioids was driven from 1997 onwards by the medical practice of prescrib- ing more and higher doses of opioids,97 which also resulted in the diversion and misuse of prescription opioids, as they were considered less stigmatized than heroin. This was followed in 2010 by changes in the formulation of commonly prescribed opioids, such as OxyContin, \u00ae to make them controlled- release and tamper proof, thereby preventing their misuse by snorting or injecting. From 2007 onwards, an increase in heroin use was also observed, which was attributed to the availability of pure and cheaper heroin in the market.98 It has been shown that each $100 decrease in the price per pure gram of heroin 93 Paul Griffiths, Michael Evans-Brown and bal-ance right in complex system\", Addiction, vol. 109, No. 2 (February 2014), pp. 182-188. 94 Ibid. 95 Report of the International Narcotics Control Board for 2012 (E/INCB/2012/1). 96 Compton and others, \"Relationship between nonmedical prescription-opioid use and heroin use\". 97 Nicholas B.

Among prescription opioids misused in the United States, hydrocodone and oxycodone still remain the most common, but the use of other opioids such as tramadol, morphine and fentanyl is also reported not infrequently. The misuse of prescription opioids remains highest among those aged 18-25 years, fol - lowed by among persons aged 26 years and older. Opioid-related deaths in the United States The opioid epidemic has taken its toll. Of the 52,000 total drug-related deaths, those related to opioids accounted for more than 60 per cent. Rates of deaths involving opioids, specifically heroin and synthetic opioids, the latter probably driven primar - ily by illicit fentanyl, have increased considerably across the United States. In 2015, the death rate from synthetic opioids, increased by 72 per cent compared with the previous year, whereas heroin overdose deaths increased by 23 per cent over the tion; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told to take a drug; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor.Fig. 13 Trends in the use of heroin and prescription opioids in the United States, 2002-2015 Source: United States, Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, Key Substance Use and Mental Health Indicators in the United States: Results from the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, HHS Publication No. SMA 16-4984, NSDUH Series H-51 (Rockville, Maryland, 2016).02,0004,0006,0008,00010,00012,00014,000 01002003004005006007008009001,000 2002 2003 2004 2005 20062007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 20132014 2015 Number of persons reporting non- medical use of prescription opioids (thousands)Number of persons who used heroin (thousands) Heroin past-year Heroin past-month Prescription opioids past-year Prescription opioids past-month Fig. 14 Age-adjusted rates of death caused by prescription opioids and heroin in the United States, 1999-2015 Source: United States Department of Health and Human Ser - vices, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, National Vital Statistics System, Mortality.

While heroin use has remained high among men, the rate of increase of heroin use among women has been higher than among men: between 2002 and 2004, the average rate of past-year heroin use was 2.4 per 1,000 men and 0.8 per 1,000 women, whereas between 2013 and 2015, the rate of past-year heroin use increased to 4.3 per 1,000 men and 2.0 per 1,000 women. As discussed above, the increase in heroin use has occurred against the backdrop of a prescription opioids epidemic. Women, particularly those aged 45 years or older, are more likely to suffer from and receive treatment for chronic pain related to musculoskeletal conditions or with visceral origins (arthritis-related pains, irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, etc.).a, b The most common forms of pain are more prevalent among women, and pain is more intense and of longer dura - tion in women than in men .c, d It is therefore not surprising that women use prescription opioids more than men. As the progression to addiction to opioids may be accelerated among women, the development of addiction among women follow - ing treatment with opioids for a legitimate medical condition (iatrogenic addiction) may explain the comparable levels of misuse of prescription opioids among the sexes.e In 2015, 4 per cent of women, compared with 5.3 per cent of men, had misused prescription opioids in the previous year. Most heroin users have a history of non-medical use of pre- scription opioid pain relievers, and an increase in the rate of heroin overdose deaths has occurred concurrently with an epidemic of prescription opioid overdoses. In 2015, there were nearly 13,000 overdose deaths related to heroin use, with nearly a quarter of them among women. However, the alarming trend is that between 2002 and 2015, heroin over - dose deaths among women increased nearly ninefold. The highest numbers and rates of heroin overdose deaths were reported among women aged 25 to 44 years old.f Trends in heroin use among men and women, United States, 2002-2015 Source: Data from Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, Key substance use and mental health indicators in the United States 2002-2015.

Pharmaceutical opioidsyears. With approximately 2 mg amounting to a lethal dose for humans, fentanyl has a narrow margin of safety. Pharmaceutical products containing fen- tanyl can easily prove toxic if users increase the dose or change the route of administration. Since 2013, the number of substances containing fentanyl reported to and analysed by the National Forensic Laboratory Information System in the United States has been increasing, and it increased dramatically over the period 2014-2015.108 The number of reports of fentanyl and other drugs within the same item analysed has also increased considerably, with 93 per cent of reports showing fentanyl and heroin in the same substance. Although pharmaceutical fentanyl is diverted for abuse in the United States, the majority of reports of fentanyl, both individually and mixed with other drugs, result from clandestinely produced and trafficked fentanyl, rather than from diverted pharmaceutical fenta- nyl.109 There have also been reports of the emergence of many fentanyl analogues, such as acetylfentanyl and carfentanyl, and of other synthetic opioids, such as AH-7921 and MT-45, in Canada, the United States and in Europe. 108 United States Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, Diversion Control Division, National Forensic Laboratory Information System: 2015 Annual Report (Springfield, Virginia, 2016). 109 \"Special report: opiates and related drugs reported in NFLIS, 2009-2014\".same period.104, 105 It is estimated that nearly 40 per cent of heroin-related deaths involved fentanyl, with many of those who overdose on fentanyl being unaware of what they had been using.106 In addi- tion to being mixed with heroin, fentanyl is also sold as other drugs, such as \"ecstasy\", or as counter - feit versions of prescription drugs such as OxyContin, \u00ae alprazolam and hydrocodone, among others. Moreover, the fentanyl analogue acetylfen- tanyl was also confirmed in at least 25 deaths reported by different states during the period 2013-2014.107 Appearance of fentanyl and its analogues One of the most potent opioids, fentanyl is increas - ingly reported in the United States.

The presence of acetylfentanyl was confirmed in all of those cases.113 Monitoring of and research into the misuse of pre- scription opioids in Europe have focused on the diversion of buprenorphine and methadone from substitution treatment and fentanyl diverted from licit channels or illicitly produced.114 However, it is important to consider that some potentially important developments in the misuse of prescrip- tion opioids may have remained largely underreported in Europe because of the limitations of current monitoring systems. For example, the misuse of tramadol, gabapentin and pregabalin (both used to treat epilepsy) appears to be increasing, although it is difficult to detect using the routine, available data sources. European Union Medicine Study Implemented as a parallel series of national surveys conducted in Denmark, Germany, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom in 2014,115 the European Union Medicine Study looked at the extent of the non-medical use of prescription drugs (stimulants, opioids and sedatives) and its characteristics among persons aged 12 to 49 years. The past-year preva - lence of the non-medical use of opioids among respondents was estimated at 5 per cent, with the highest prevalence of both lifetime and past-year use among those living in Spain, followed by the United Kingdom. Comparable levels of misuse of prescription opioids were seen among men (past- year prevalence of 5.7 per cent) and among women (past-year prevalence of 4.2 per cent). Higher levels of misuse of prescription opioids were seen among older age groups and the unemployed. Being arrested in childhood (prior to age 15) and having a sexually transmitted disease or HIV were also associated with a greater likelihood of past-year misuse of prescription medications, including 113 EMCDDA and Europol, Acetylfentanyl: EMCDDA-Europol Joint Report On A New Psychoactive Substance: N-phenyl-N-[1-(2-phenylethyl)piperidin-4-yl]acetamide (acetylfentanyl), Joint Reports Series (Luxembourg, Publications Office of the European Union, 2016). 114 Griffiths, Evans-Brown and Sedefov, \"The (mis)use of P . Novak and others, \"Nonmedical use of prescription drugs in the European Union\", BMC Psychiatry, vol. 16 (2016).Misuse of opioids in Europe The misuse of prescription opioids in Europe has been primarily observed in the context of heroin use. In the past decade, the availability of heroin has declined in Europe,110 while the availability of sub - stitution treatment for heroin use disorders has increased considerably. Thus, transitions between heroin and other opioids, such as fentanyl and opioid substitution medicines, have been observed in parts of Europe. In some countries, such as Esto - nia and Finland, where the heroin market plummeted in 2002 and 2001, respectively, heroin has been entirely displaced by fentanyl (mostly illicit) and buprenorphine, respectively. In recent years, prescription opioids and new synthetic opi - oids, which can be purchased online, have also been appearing in other markets in Europe.111 While heroin still remains the most commonly used opioid in Europe, and the opioid for the use of which most people seek treatment, there has been an increase in treatment demand related to prescrip - tion opioids. In 2014, 18 countries reported that more than 10 per cent of all opioid treatment admis - sions were for problems related to opioids other than heroin, an increase from 11 countries in 2013. The most common opioids for the use of which treat - ment was sought were methadone (diverted), buprenorphine, fentanyl, codeine, morphine, trama - dol and oxycodone. Similarly, opioids other than heroin seized in European countries in 2014, although not in large quantities, were opium, mor - phine, methadone, buprenorphine, tramadol and fentanyl. Some pharmaceutical opioids seized may have been diverted from pharmaceutical supplies, while others were manufactured specifically for the illicit market.112 The availability of acetylfentanyl has also been reported in the European Union since at least 2013 and has been detected in nine coun- tries. Although the quantities of acetylfentanyl seized are small, it still remains a concern, especially given the 32 reported deaths in Europe between 2013 and 2015 (2 in Germany, 1 in Poland, 27 in Sweden 110 European Drug Report 2016: Trends and Developments. 111 EMCDDA and European Police Office (Europol), EU Drug Markets Report: In-Depth Analysis, Joint publications series (Luxembourg, Publications Office of the European Union, 2016). 112 European Drug Report 2016: Trends and Developments.37 2 GLOBAL OVERVIEW OF DRUG DEMAND AND SUPPLY C. Pharmaceutical opioidsopioids. However, the prescription of a pain reliever was associated with a risk of non-medical use of prescription opioids some eight times higher than other predictors. Consistent with findings in the United States, most people reporting past-year misuse of prescription opioids in the five European countries in the study had obtained them through their social networks (i.e., from friends or family), but many had also stolen or obtained them fraudulently from a doctor. Also consistent with findings in other recent reports, the European Union Medicine Study showed that the purchase of prescription opioids from online pharmacies also figured as one of the sources. Among other findings, polydrug use, particularly the use of illicit drugs among past-year non-medical prescription opioid users, was also quite common in the five European countries, ranging from 21 per cent of past-year users in Spain to 43 per cent in the United Kingdom. Among people reporting the non- medical use of prescription opioids, those more likely to engage in use of illicit drugs were also more likely to report severe psychological distress and to have Fig. 17 Misuse of prescription opioids, by sex, age and employment status, five European countries Source: Scott P .

Similarly, those who obtained prescription opioids through theft, forgery or doctor-shopping were about twice as likely to have used illicit drugs as those who had not. Although at lower levels than in the United States, the misuse of prescription opioids and the appear- ance of new synthetic opioids that can be purchased online are appearing in Europe and are likely to have increasing importance for both public health and law enforcement in the coming years. Misuse of tramadol in Africa and Asia T ramadol is an opioid that is widely used to treat moderate to severe pain, and has also been used in the treatment of sexual dysfunction, such as prema - ture ejaculation.116 In addition to the high levels of misuse of prescription opioids reported by many countries in Asia and Africa,117 there is growing evidence of the non-medical use of tramadol in some countries in Africa and the Near and Middle East. These have been corroborated in recent years by seizures of considerable amounts of tramadol in North, West and Central Africa and in the Near and Middle East.118 Between 2012 and 2014, the Islamic Republic of Iran, countries in the Near and Middle East and many countries in Africa reported to UNODC that seizures had been made of large amounts of tramadol that was being trafficked into those countries. Countries in the Middle East reported seizures of 310 kg in 2012; a quantity that increased to over 22 tons in 2014. Similarly, in Benin, the Central African Republic, Cote d'Ivoire, Niger and the Sudan, over 300 kg of tramadol were seized in 2013 and over 2.6 tons in 2014. In 2015, Benin alone reported a seizure of 110 tons of the substance. The non-medical use of tramadol has been reported by many countries, including Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritius, Saudi Arabia and Togo, and many have put tramadol under national control in recent years. Misuse of tramadol among adolescents and young people in countries such as Egypt, Iran (Islamic 116 Emad A.

For example, in a study of people with drug use disorders in an outpatient addiction clinic in Egypt during the period 2012- 2013, tramadol was the most common opioid used,119 the majority of whom were polydrug users. In a study of secondary school students in Egypt in 2013, the most commonly used substances were tramadol, cannabis and alcohol. In a study among adolescents in the Islamic Republic of Iran in 2013, the lifetime prevalence of tramadol use was 4.8 per cent (7.6 per cent among males and 1.8 percent among females). Polydrug use was common with the likelihood of past-month use of other substances such as alcohol, \"ecstasy\", methamphetamine and opium was reported as high among that cohort of adolescents .120 In the United Arab Emirates, a cohort study in 2015 of male patients at the national treatment centre showed opioids and alcohol to be the most common substances used.121 Nearly 67 per cent of opioid users were using tramadol for non-medical purposes. Among the older group within the cohort (those aged 30 years or older), heroin was the most com- monly used opioid; tramadol and codeine were commonly used and preferred over heroin among the younger group. The majority of the cohort using tramadol were doing so on a daily basis, at an aver- age of eight to nine tablets (100 mg per tablet). The proportion of polydrug users in the cohort was also high, with nearly 85 per cent being polydrug users, of whom the majority had been using a combina- tion of four or more substances . Common reasons cited for the misuse of tramadol in the above-mentioned studies included its mood- enhancing effect, to prolong sexual intercourse, to 119 Nabil R.

Representing an increase in size of 60 per cent over the period 2010-2016, largely as a result of the rise in opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan, this is the second-largest total area under opium poppy cultivation recorded in recent years (after the peak in 2014). However, as opium poppy surveys were not conducted in Myanmar (the world's second larg - est opium-producing country in 2015) or in the Lao People's Democratic Republic in 2016, the global estimates for 2016 have to be interpreted with caution.128 Mostly linked to a decrease in coca bush cultivation in Colombia, the global area under coca bush 128 Myanmar and the Lao People's Democratic Republic together accounted for 22 per cent of the total global area under opium poppy cultivation and 12 per cent of total opium production over the period 2010-2015.

The non-medical use of prescription opioids in the Near and Middle East and North Africa, particularly among young people, appears to be more for recreational purposes than as a result of developing addiction (iatrogenic addic - tion) following treatment for a legitimate medical condition involving pharmaceutical opioids.122 Dif- ferent studies have concluded that the high levels of misuse of tramadol are a result of its easy availability in pharmacies and on the illicit market (as it is traf- ficked in large quantities), its lower price compared with illicit drugs, perceptions among users that tram - adol is safe as it is a prescription medication, and the ease with which it can be hidden.123, 124, 125, 126 D. EXTENT OF DRUG SUPPLY Cultivation and production On the basis of reports received by Member States, there are strong indications that cannabis continues to be the most widely illicitly produced drug world - wide, both in terms of the size and geographical spread of the area under cultivation and the volume actually produced. Over the period 2010-2015, cul - tivation of cannabis was reported to UNODC, directly or indirectly, by 135 countries in all regions, covering 92 per cent of the total global popula - tion.127 This is almost triple the 49 countries (mostly in Asia) where opium poppy cultivation might take place and more than 16 times the number of coun - tries (8, all located in the Americas) where coca bush cultivation might take place. 122 David F .

Based on the \"new\" conversion ratios, total cocaine production in 2015 was 1,125 tons, representing an overall increase of 25 per cent over the period 2013-2015, and thus a return to its 2008 level.129 After cannabis, cocaine accounts for the largest quantities seized The distribution of seizures across the different drug types can be analysed in terms of number of cases and quantity seized. These two types of analysis show slightly different patterns. The distribution of drug seizure cases reported worldwide in 2015 shows that more than half of seizure cases were of cannabis (mostly cannabis herb), followed by ATS (mostly methamphetamine), opioids (mostly heroin), coca/cocaine-related sub- stances and and ketamine). After cannabis (primarily cannabis herb and, to a lesser extent, cannabis resin), the largest seizures at the global level in 2015, in terms of quantity, involved coca/cocaine-related substances. Excluding seizures of coca leaf, the bulk of all coca-related sei - zures were in the form of the end product, cocaine 129 More information on the \"old\" and \"new\" conversion ratio can be found in the online methodology section of the World Drug Report 2017.cultivation was nearly halved during the period 2000-2013. The global area then increased by 30 per cent during the period 2013-2015, mainly because coca bush cultivation started to increase again in Colombia, which has offset the decreasing levels of coca bush cultivation reported by Bolivia (Plurinational State of) and Peru in recent years. Reaching 156,500 hectares in 2015, the global area under coca bush cultivation was more or less the same as in 2010, but still 29 per cent less than its peak in 2000. Recent increase in opium production In 2016, global opium production showed an increase of some 30 per cent compared with the previous year. Greater than the increase in the size of the area under cultivation, this was primarily the result of improved yields in Afghanistan, where there was a partial recovery from the very low levels recorded in the previous year. However, at 6,380 tons, total global opium production was still some 20 per cent lower than the peak in 2014, and close to the average reported in recent years. Cocaine manufacture is on the increase again Irrespective of the conversion ratios used for con - verting coca leaf to pure cocaine hydrochloride, total cocaine manufacture fell during the period 2006- 2013, before increasing again during the period Fig. 20 Total area under opium poppy and coca bush cultivation, 1998-2016 Sources: UNODC coca and opium surveys in various countries; responses to the annual report questionnaire; and United States, Department of State, International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, various years. - 50,000 100,000 150,000 200,000 250,000 300,000 350,000 1998 19992000 2001 200220032004 2005 2006 2007 200820092010 2011 20122013 20142015 2016Total area under cultivation (hectares) Opium poppy Coca bush41 2 GLOBAL OVERVIEW OF DRUG DEMAND AND SUPPLY D.

Note: Based on information from 64 countries. 42 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2017pharmaceutical opioids increased sharply over the period 2010-2015, driven by sharp increases in the quantities of tramadol, hydrocodone and fentanyl seized. Notwithstanding some increases in seizures of cannabis resin, the amount of cannabis seized declined slightly over the period 2010-2015 as whole, although they showed an upward trend from 2012. Drug trafficking over the darknet continues to increase at a fast pace The \"surface web\", which is accessible through tra- ditional search engines, contains just 4 per cent of all information available on the Internet. The remaining 96 per cent is stored on the \"deep web\". A part of it, the darknet, contains information that is intentionally hidden and only accessible using special web browsers.130 The darknet is used for all kinds of activities, illicit included, particularly drug trafficking. Users typically access the darknet through the \"Onion router\" (TOR) to ensure that 130 EU Drug Markets Report.Increases in seizures reported mainly for synthetic drugs and cocaine As a result of sharp increases in the quantities of amphetamine and methamphetamine seized, total seizures of ATS doubled over the period 2010-2015. Seizures of \"ecstasy\" were on the decline until 2011, but probably started to increase thereafter, reflecting increased supply due to improved access to alterna - tive precursor chemicals and/or pre-precursors used in the drug's manufacture. The quantities of synthetic NPS seized increased fourfold over the period 2010-2015, reflecting a sharp increase in seizures of synthetic cannabinoids and synthetic cathinones, although seizures of syn- thetic cannabinoids have actually fallen in recent years. Overall, plant-based NPS seizures declined after 2010, owing to a decrease in the amount of khat seized. Seizures of cocaine increased over the period 2010- 2015, in particular during 2015, in line with reports of rising levels of cocaine manufacture. Although seizures of opiates remained stable, seizures of Fig. 23 Global drug seizures of selected drugs, by quantity, 2010-2015 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire.

Extent of drug supplyStudies show that while the proportion of drug market operations through the Internet remains small, their rapid growth may represent a significant threat.135 Information on the extent to which drug users purchase drugs over the Internet can be found in the findings of the Global Drug Survey, which has been conducted several times in recent years. Although these data are derived from a non-repre- sentative sample, the self-reports of around 100,000 Internet users in over 50 countries provide a rough idea of the propensity of drug users to obtain drugs over the darknet, as well as how easily they can access it. Among survey participants who had used drugs in the past year, the proportion who obtained drugs over the darknet in the previous 12 months rose by 70 per cent during the period 2014-2017. An increase in use of the darknet was particularly pronounced in the United Kingdom, where the pro - portion of annual drug users participating in the survey who reported having obtained drugs over the darknet has doubled since 2014 to reach 25.3 per cent in 2017, and in the United States, where the proportion increased more rapidly but then declined slightly in 2017 to 13.2 per cent.136 Nonetheless, this suggests that the upward trend in the use of the darknet continues to gain momentum in some countries, despite various market disrup- tions, linked to the closure of several darknet market sites by the authorities, as well as exit scams in which market owners closed down their sites unexpectedly, stealing funds from their clients. The increases in the use of the darknet for drug purchases are remarkable as, overall, drug traffick- ing (not limited to the darknet) appears to have increased only slightly in recent years: from 2.1 mil - lion cases in 2013 to 2.4 million cases in 2015.137 joint investigations to combat drug trafficking via the vir- tual market (darknet) in the European Union, held in Bad Erlach, Austria, from 10 to 12 November 2015. 135 Kristy Kruithof and others, Internet-facilitated Drugs Trade: An Analysis of the Size, Scope and the Role of the Netherlands, Research Report Series (Santa Monica, California, Rand Corporation, 2016). 136 Global Drug Survey 2017, detailed findings on drug crypto-markets.

Delivery of the drugs is usually carried out by public or private postal services,133 and parcels are often sent to anonymous post office boxes or automated booths (\"pack stations\") designed for self-service parcel collection.134 131 EMCDDA, The Internet and Drug Markets, Insights Series No. 21 (Luxembourg, Publications Office of the European Union, 2016). 132 Europol, SOCTA 2017: European Union Serious and Organ- ised Crime Threat Assessment - Crime in the Age of T echnology (The Hague, 2017), p. 22. 133 World Customs Organization, Illicit Trade Report 2015 (Brussels, December 2016), p. 44. 134 Based on the findings of an international conference on 12.414.318.325.3 7.79.115 13.2 4.75.97.6 7.9 0510152025 2014 2015 2016 2017Proportion (percentage) United Kingdom United States Global averageFig. 24 Annual drug users obtaining drugs over the darknet in the past 12 months, 2014-2017 Note: Based on annual information from more than 60,000 past- year drug users.

Most revenue was made in North America and Europe and most of the sales and purchases took place in the same regions. The largest interregional traffic was from Asia to North America. In terms of e-mail addresses linked to drug listings, another study finding was the dominance of North America (43 per cent) and Europe (more than 32 per cent), followed by Asia (more than 13 per cent, mostly China, followed by India and Afghanistan) and Oceania (more than 9 per cent). Vendors in countries in Asia seemed to be more involved in the wholesale business, while retail sales were dominated by vendors in North America and Europe. The study suggested that transactions for all drug types had increased. Overall, the value of transactions in the eight markets that dominated the darknet in January 2016 was 2.6 times greater than that of transactions on the Silk Road market in September 2013, which dominated the darknet at that time. That is equivalent to an average annual growth of some 50 per cent during that period. Above-average growth rates of transactions were identified for stimulants (cocaine and amphetamines) and cannabis, while growth in \"psychedelics\" turned out \"Ecstasy\", cannabis, LSD and NPS138 were the drugs that Global Drug Survey respondents most com - monly obtained over the darknet in 2017.139 Another study140 used \"web scraping/crawling\" tech - niques141 to look at eight major darknet markets that were in existence as of January 2016 (AlphaBay, Cryptomarket, Dark Net Heroes League, Dream - market, French Dark Net, Hansa, Nucleus and Python) and which accounted for 106,000 listings, representing around three quarters of all listings on the darknet. Based on the activities of identified vendors, the study found that 71 per cent of vendors in those eight darknet markets sold drugs (includ- ing 62 per cent who sold only drugs and drug-related products and 9 per cent who sold drugs and non- drug-related products) and only 29 per cent operated exclusively in other activities. The largest share of those vendors was located in North America (38 per 138 The definition of NPS used in the Global Drug Survey is not comparable to the definition used by the UNODC. 139 Global Drug Survey 2017, Detailed findings on drug cryptomarkets.

Extent of drug supplypean Union: 24.3 billion euros in 2013),148 the overall revenue calculated by the study (from $14.2 million to $25 million per month, or equivalent to between $170 million and $300 million per annum) is, however, rather small. Nevertheless, caution needs to be applied as the methodology used in the study is likely to have underestimated the amount pur - chased per transaction, and thus overall revenue. In the Netherlands, a further study,149 based on samples submitted by users for anonymous testing purposes (32,663 drug samples from January 2013 to January 2016), revealed that the total proportion of online purchases tripled, from 1.4 per cent in 2013 to 4.1 per cent in 2015. Overall, 15 per cent of the drug users who had purchased drugs online used the darknet for those purchases over the period 2013-2015 and 26 per cent used Google-indexed webshops; no additional information was obtained for the remaining 59 per cent. This suggests that the proportion of drugs purchased in the Nether - lands over the darknet ranged from 0.6 per cent to 1.5 per cent in 2015. 150 That study also suggested that more than one third of NPS samples were bought online (very few over the darknet), while online purchases of each con - trolled substance did not exceed 6 per cent (\"ecstasy\": 148 European Drug Report 2016: Trends and Developments. 149 Daan van der Gouwe and others, \"Purity, adulteration and price of drugs bought on-line versus off-line in the Nether-lands\", Addiction vol. 112, No. 4 (April 2017), pp. 640-648. 150 For further details on the calculation, see the online meth-odology section of the World Drug Report 2017.to be below average. The growth rates for prescription drugs, \"ecstasy\" and opioids was close to the overall average. The study also calculated \"minimum\" revenue by multiplying the number of transactions by the prices listed (assuming the purchase of one unit per trans - action), thus arriving at monthly minimum revenues of $14.2 million. This was twice the minimum rev - enue (based on the same methodology) calculated for the Silk Road in September 2013. Sales of cannabis, stimulants (cocaine and ampheta - mine) and \"ecstasy\" accounted for 70 per cent of total drug-related revenues in the eight darknet mar - kets investigated.142 When compared with the overall distribution of drugs in the United States143 and European Union144 markets, methamphetamine and heroin appear to be underrepresented on the darknet, while \"ecstasy\" and \"psychedelics\" (hallu- cinogens) are overrepresented in sales over the darknet.145, 146 The largest share of transactions in the eight markets considered in the study (64 per cent) concerned transactions of less than $100, typical of what one would expect of retail sales to the end consumer. However, such sales only accounted for 18 per cent of total revenue, with most revenue (57 per cent) being generated by transactions of $100-$1,000. T ransactions exceeding $1,000 accounted for 25 per cent of total revenue, suggesting that large wholesale business activities to date are not really taking place to a significant extent over the darknet and that drug cartels and other large organizations are apparently not yet that involved in the buying and selling of drugs over the darknet.

Although purchases of controlled substances over the darknet were significant (LSD: 53 per cent; amphetamine: 48 per cent; cocaine: 46 per cent; \"ecstasy\": 35 per cent), no online purchases of heroin were recorded.

Afghanistan is the only country for which the proportion of potential opium production not converted into heroin within the country is estimated. For all other countries, for the purposes of this table, it is assumed that all opium produced is converted into heroin. If all of the opium produced in Afghanistan in 2016 had been converted into heroin, total potential heroin manufacture would have amounted to 668 tons at the global level (510 tons in Afghanistan). The amount of heroin produced in Afghanistan is calculated using two parameters that may change: (a) the distribution between opium that is not processed and opium processed into heroin; and (b) the conversion ratio into heroin. The first parameter is indirectly estimated, based on seizures of opium versus seizures of heroin and morphine reported by Afghanistan and neighbouring countries. For 2016, this calculation results in a proportion of 57 per cent of potential opium production in Afghanistan converted into heroin. For the second parameter, from 2005 to 2013, a conversion ratio of opium to morphine/heroin of 7:1 was used, based on interviews conducted with Afghan morphine/heroin \"cooks\", on an actual heroin production exercise conducted by two (illiterate) Afghan heroin \"cooks\", documented by the German Bundeskriminalamt in Afghanistan in 2003 (published in Bulletin on Narcotics, vol. LVII, Nos. 1 and 2, 2005, pp. 11-31) and UNODC studies on the morphine content of Afghan opium (12.3 per cent over the period 2010-2012, down from 15 per cent over the period 2000-2003). Starting from 2014, a different approach to the conversion was adopted, reflecting updated information on morphine content and a different method for taking purity into account. The revised approach uses a ratio of 18.5 kg of opium for 1 kg of 100 per cent pure white heroin hydrochloride (see MCN and UNODC, Afghanistan Opium Survey 2014); based on an estimated export quality of 51 per cent in 2016, this translates into a ratio of 9.5 kg (range: 9-10 kg) of opium for 1 kg of export-quality heroin (for 2016). For more details, see MCN and UNODC, Afghanistan Opium Survey 2016 - Cultivation and Production. For countries other than Afghanistan, a \"traditional\" conversion ratio of opium to heroin of 10:1 is used. The ratios will be adjusted when improved information becomes available. Figures in ital - ics are preliminary and may be revised when updated information becomes available.2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Total potential opium manufacture 472 553 686 600 427 383 467 377 555 542 327 448 58 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2017 Reported eradication of coca bush, 2006-2015 Source: UNODC annual report questionnaire and government reports.
