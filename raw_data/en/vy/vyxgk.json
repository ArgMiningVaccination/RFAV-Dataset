In 1861 James Edward Hyamson was a renowned Herbalist with a successful practice in Liverpool (UK). The family legacy continued when Jame's son, John Hyamson, opened his own successful Herbal practice in Thornton Place, Toxteth, Liverpool in 1911 and Herbalism has continued to be an integral part of the family ever since then. James Hyamson was the Great, Great, Great-Grandfather of one of the founding partners of the Hyamson Institute; Dr Paul Greham Dr Paul studied at the University of Liverpool and graduated with his Bachelor's Degree in 2004. Since then, for the last 16 years, he has been involved in Healthcare all around the world, working in various settings including Hospitals, Private Practice and Government Services. He now passes on all of his wisdom and experience in the healthcare field to empower his students in the art and science of Natural and Complementary Medicine. Dr Paul co-founded the Hyamson Institute in 2018 with his partner Nelly. Nelly is a Naturopath and she graduated from Southern Cross University in Australia in 2003 with a Bachelor of Naturopathy Degree. For the past 17 years she has worked in a variety of different settings and gained a vast wealth of experience in all areas of Natural and Complementary Medicine along the way. In 2018 they teamed up (personally and also in business!) and together set about creating a platform where they could share their collective 30+ years of knowledge, skills and experience in the fields of Western Allopathic Healthcare and Natural Medicine with other people. The Hyamson Institute was born. _______________________________________________ Our dream was to create an online educational institute where we could provide high quality and great value training courses that would enable people to equip themselves with the skills and qualifications to improve their own health as well as that of those around them.
