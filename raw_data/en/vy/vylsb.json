We firmly believe that equity, diversity, and inclusion in all our residency and fellowship programs improves education, provides tremendo us opportunities for community engagement, and creates better -trained physicians. As the Sponsoring Institution (SI) of graduate medical education, Tulane provides the educational infrastructure necessary for training in 40 ACGME-accredited residency and fellowship programs. Our faculty are dedicated and experienced clinicians, educators, and scientists, and our residents and fellows provide care at participating hospitals offering diverse clinical exposure. Residents and fellows advance in their clini cal responsibilities based upon assessed competency, with close supervision by Tulane's faculty at each stage of their development. Dr. Paul Gladden, Associate Dean for Graduate Medical Education and Designated Institutional Official (DIO), and the Sc hool's Graduate Medical Education Committee (GMEC) together have responsibility for the oversight and administration of each of Tulane's ACGME-accredited programs, and for ensuring compliance with the ACGME institutional, Common, specialty/subspecialty -specific Program, and Recognition Requirements. The Tulane School of Medicine 's (TUSOM) Office of Graduate Medical Education ensures that all residents and fellows receive an accredited educational experience of the highest quality and assumes stewardshi p for creating a supportive and safe clinical environment that facilitates residents' professional, ethical, and personal development. The Office of Graduate Medical Education provides support to ensure that each program's clinical environment facilitates residents' professional, ethical, and personal development; and that each program has the educational infrastructure it needs for successful training. The Resident/Fellow Congress (TRFC) provides residents/fellows at Tulane with a platform to communicate and exchange information relevant to their ACGME -accredited programs and their learning and working environments. The Congress is composed of representatives from each program elected by their peers. The Congress in turn elects resident represe ntatives to serve on the GMEC, where they provide a representative voice for the governance of our programs. If the Graduate Medical Education Office can assist you in any way during your years of training at Tulane, please do not hesitate to con tact us (504 -988-5464) or visit our office in the Murphy Building, 15th floor. 5 SECTION 1: PROGRAM SIZE & COMPLEMENT 6 I. Policy on Resident Eligibility and Selection Revised 12/01/2021 I. References In accordance with Section IV.B of the ACGME Institutional Requirements, the Sponsoring Institution must have written policies and procedures for resident recruitment, selection, eligibility and appointment consistent with ACGME Institutional and Common Pr ogram Requirements, and Recognition Requirements (if applicable), and must monitor each of its ACGME -accredited programs for compliance. II. Definitions Throughout this Policy and the School of Medicine's additional GME Policies and Procedures, the term \"resident\" collectively refers to both residents and fellows and \" residency program \" or \"School of Medicine residency program \" collectively refers to residency programs and fellowship programs. III. Policy A. Resident Eligibility 1. To be eligible for appointment to an ACGME -accredited residency program sponsored by Tulane University School of Medicine (the \"School of Medicine\") applicants must meet one of the following qualifications: a. Be a graduate from a medical school in the United Stat es or Canada that is accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME); or, b. Be a graduate from a college of osteopathic medicine in the United States or Canada that is accredited by the American Osteopathic Association (AOA); or, c. Be a gradu ate from a medical school outside of the United States or Canada and meet one of the following additional qualifications: i. Holds a currently -valid certificate from the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) prior to appointment; or ii. Holds a full and unrestricted license to practice medicine in the state of Louisiana, as issued by the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners (LSBME). 2. International medical graduates who are not United States citizens must also hold a current, valid J - 1 Visa sponsored by the ECFMG. In general, the School of Medicine does not sponsor work visas (H1-B) for graduate medical education. The School of Medicin e makes limited exceptions to this policy. A program seeking to sponsor an international medical graduate through the H1 -B work visa process must obtain the written approval of the DIO. 3. Subject to more specific requirements that may be set by an ACGME Rev iew Committee applicable to the program, all prerequisite post -graduate clinical education required for initial entry or transfer into an ACGME -accredited residency program needs to be completed in ACGME - accredited residency programs, AOA -approved residenc y programs, Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC) -accredited or College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC)- accredited residency programs in Canada, or in residency programs with ACGME International (ACGME -I) Advanced Specialty Accre ditation. 7 4. Upon matriculation, the residency program must receive verification of each resident's level of competency in the required clinical field using ACGME Milestones, or, if permitted by the program's ACGME Review Committee, using CanMEDS, or ACGME -I Mileston es evaluations, from the prior training program. The ACGME Review Committee for each residency program may further specify prerequisite postgraduate clinical education. 5. Physicians who have completed a residency program that is not accredited by the ACGME, AOA, RCPSC, CFPC or ACGME -I (with Advanced Specialty Accreditation) may enter an ACGME - accredited residency program in the same specialty at the PGY -1 level and, at the discretion of the Program Director and with approval by the GMEC, may be advanced to th e PGY-2 level based on the ACGME Milestones evaluations of the residency program. This section of the Policy applies only to entry into a residency program in those specialties for which an initial clinical year is not required for entry. 6. To the extent pe rmitted by a residency program's Review Committee, an exceptionally qualified international graduate applicant who does not satisfy the eligibility requirements set forth above, may be accepted by a School of Medicine residency program in accordance with t he conditions set forth in the ACGME's Common Program Requirements, including review and approval of the applicant's exceptional qualifications by the GMEC. Any exceptionally qualified international graduate applicant accepted through this exception shall have an evaluation of their performance by the residency program's Clinical Competency Committee within 12 weeks of matriculation B. Resident Selection 1. School of Medicine residency programs select residents from among eligible applicants on the basis of their preparedness, aptitude, academic credentials, personal qualities consistent with excellence in medicine (e.g., motivation, honesty , and integrity), ability to communicate, demonstrated commitment to fostering equity, diversity and inclusion in medicine an d ability to benefit from the education of the residency program. 2. School of Medicine graduate medical education residency programs participate in the National Residency Matching Program (NRMP or \"the Match\") in selecting residents, with the exceptions of the Urology and Ophthalmology programs, which select residents through the San Francisco Matching Program (\"SF Match\"), and the hematopathology, cytopathology, dermatopathology, and preventive which do not have nationally -organized resi dency match programs. 3. Applicant characteristics may be assessed by reviewing the applicant's Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) application or an equivalent application form. A residency program's review may include, but is not limited to, the following: a. The applicant's letter of recommendation from the Dean of the applicant's medical school; b. The applicant's letters of recommendation from medical school faculty; c. The applicant's personal letters of recommendation; d. The applicant's medical scho ol transcript and grades; e. The applicant's National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) (i.e., United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)) or COMLEX scores; f. The applicant's scholarly and community service record; 8 g. The applicant's noteworthy achievements, humanistic qualities, personal qualities consistent with excellence in medicine and qualities important to the desired specialty; and/or h. The applicant's evaluation from those who interview the applicant on the date of their interview with the residency pro gram. 4. The School of Medicine considers all candidates for graduate medical education regardless of race, sex, creed, nationality, national origin, disability, sexual orientation or other legally protected status. 5. Each residency program must provide a cop y of the resident contract available in Appendix C to applicants during the interview process and programs must post a copy of the resident contract on their website. Information that is provided in the resident contract must include: a. The terms, conditions, and benefits of appointment to the residency program, either in effect at the time of the interview or that will be in effect at the time of the applicant's eventual appointment; b. Stipends, benefits, vacation, leaves of absence, prof essional liability coverage and disability insurance accessible to residents; and c. Health insurance accessible to residents and their eligible dependents. d. The additional information set forth in Section E of this Policy. 6. Selected residents must obtain a l icense or permit through the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners and satisfy the LSBME background check standards in order to train in any School of Medicine residency program. Residents selected and training in a residency program that rotates at the Southeast Louisiana Veterans System (VA) may be required to go through additional background checks, as part of the onboarding process to rotate at the VA. Drug testing currently is not required by the School of Medicine or its participating sites. C. Recruiting of Residents Outside of the Match 1. Programs that participate in an organized match (the Match and SF Match), are bound by the conditions of the agreement with that organization. No applicant to a residency program who is also a participant in an org anized match can be accepted into a residency program at the School of Medicine outside of the terms of that match process even if the recruiting program does not participate in the respective organized match. Any deviations from matching procedures and practices may necessitate receiving a waiver from the organized match. Neither applicants nor programs may release each other from a binding match commitment. 2. Match rules govern when positions unfilled after the match process may be subsequently filled outside of the organized match. For the Match, unfilled positions may not be filled until the close of the Supplemental Offer and Acceptance Program (SOAP). Resident selection criteria, outlined in Section B, above, continue to apply to the selection of resid ents outside of a match program. 3. Hematopathology, cytopathology, dermatopathology, and the preventive medicine fellowship programs (or other programs which do not have a nationally -organized match) must select fellows in accordance with the criteria outli ned in Section B, above. 4. Program Directors who wish to add additional residents to their program through complement increases and/or vacancies in a program from a resident or fellow leaving during the time of the 9 year when an organized match is not in eff ect (i.e., off -cycle) must send a formal request to the DIO, including the information outlined in the Policy on Closure, Reduction, or Expansion . 5. No resident may be enrolled in a training program outside of the above noted match procedures without prio r approval of the DIO. A program, through the program's clinical department, that enrolls a resident off cycle or otherwise outside of a match (excluding fellows to programs without an organized match program), without the prior approval of the DIO will b e financially responsible for the resident throughout the resident's training. Enrolling residents off cycle or outside of a match may result in a reduction in the program's match number for subsequent years or in a match violation. 6. Before accepting a re sident who is transferring from another program, the Program Director must obtain written or electronic verification of previous educational experiences and a summative competency -based performance evaluation of the transferring resident, and Milestones ev aluations upon matriculation. D. Recruitment of Residents Between Residency Programs within the School of Medicine 1. When a position in a School of Medicine residency program is or will become vacant, the program may advertise the vacancy within the School of Medicine and its intent to fill the position, after receiving written approval from the DIO. 2. A resident who is i nterested, but who is currently under contract in another School of Medicine residency program, may only apply for the open position if the resident is not currently bound by a binding commitment through an organized match, such as the Match (or has receiv ed a written waiver from the matching program before applying). 3. The resident applicant must disclose to the Program Director for the recruiting program, any contractual obligation that currently exists to the resident's current School of Medicine residency program and disclose to the resident's current Program Director their intention to pursue the open position. 4. The Program Director and faculty from the recruiting School of Medicine residency program must not initiate, entice or negotiate with a candidate from another School of Medicine program until the resident's current Program Director has given written approval for the program to contact the resident. 5. Before the resident can be offered the open position, a letter of intent to release the resident from their contractual obligation must be received from the current Program Director. The recruiting Program Director must also receive written or electronic v erification of the resident's previous educational experiences and a summative competency -based performance evaluation prior to acceptance of the resident and the Milestones evaluations. 6. The start date for the resident in the new program must also be approved by the resident's current Program Director. 7. The DIO, or the DIO's designee, will serve as the mediator in any situation in which the School of Medicine Program Directors cannot reach an amicable resolution to the resident wishing to switch programs. 8. Failure to abide by the rules set forth in this section may result in a reduction in the program's complement for the following year. 10 E. Agreement of Resident Appointment/Contract 1. Residents who match to a School of Medicine residency program must be sent the resident contract that outlines the terms and conditions of employment as a resident at Tulane . This contract will be mailed to the applicant within two weeks of the match results. R esidents employed outside of an organized match or off cycle will also receive the contract within two weeks of the program extending an offer for employment. The resident contract currently in effect is available in Appendix C. 2. The resident agreement of appointment/contract must comply with ACGME Institutional Requirements a nd the School of Medicine's requirements for employment. With the exception of the resident's start and finish date (the term of the contract) , the resident contract cannot be modified without t he written permission of the DIO, in consultation with the Off ice of General Counsel or GMEC as appropriate. The contract shall contain or provide a direct link to: a. Resident responsibilities; b. Duration of appointment ; c. Financial support for residents; d. Conditions for reappointment and promotion , including criteria f or non-renewal and non - promotion ; e. Grievance procedures and due process ; f. Professional liability insurance , including a summary of pertinent information regarding coverage; g. Health insurance benefits for residents and their eligible dependents and disability insurance for residents; h. Vacation, parental, sick, and other leave(s) of absence, compliant with all applicable laws, including timely notice of the effect of a leave on the ability of residents to satisfy requirements for program completion; i. Informatio n related to eligibility for specialty board examinations; and j. School of Medicine policies related to resident clinical and educational work hours, moonlighting, resident wellness and assistance, harassment and accommodations for disabilities. 3. Each residen t contract require s the signature of the resident, the Program Director, the departmental Chair, and the DIO, on behalf of The Administrators of the Tulane Educational Fund . Payroll will not authorize the resident's first payment until the DIO has signed the resident's contract . 4. Contracts for residents are extended on a yearly basis. A new contract must be initiated each year. 5. In accordance with the Policy on Non -Competition , neither the School of Medicine nor any of its ACGME-accredited residency programs will require a resident to sign a non -competition guarantee or restrictive covenant. 6. The PGY status listed in the resident's contract shall be based upon the PGY level routinely held for that position in the program (e.g ., a first year resident will be paid as a PGY -1 status, a first year 11 cardiology fellow will be paid as a PGY -4 status, etc.) regardless of the resident's years of past training. F. Residents Transferring to another Program Outside of the School of Medicine 1. In the event that a resident enrolled in a residency program sponsored by the School of Medicine transfers to a residency program outside of the School of Medicine prior to the resident's completion of their education at the School of Medicine, the residen t's Program Director must provide to the accepting residency program, written or electronic verification of the resident's previous educational experiences and a summative competency -based performance evaluation and the Milestones evaluations. G. Completion o f USMLE Step Examinations 1. The USMLE Step II Clinical Knowledge (CK) and Clinical Skills (CS) tests must be passed prior to matriculation into a residency program. 2. STEP III must be passed by December 31st of the PGY2 year of residency training. Failure to p ass STEP III by December 31st may result in a formal letter of non -renewal of contract for the upcoming academic year. This requirement also applies to residents beginning a School of Medicine residency program in program year two (PGY -2). 3. An applicant who has failed Step II or Step III (e.g., for international or transferring residents) of the USMLE more than three times, even if the examination is subsequently passed, is ineligible for enrollment in a School of Medicine residency program. 4. Any current Scho ol of Medicine resident who fails to take Step III by June 30th of the PGY -1 of training will be placed on immediate probation and leave without pay in accordance with the Policy on Remediation, Suspension, Dismissal and Grievance . The probation will remai n in effect until Step III has been taken and the Program Director receives the supporting documentation that the resident has taken the exam. The Clinical Competency Committee and/or Program Director will determine the maximum probation and leave timeline . 5. Step III must be passed by December 31st of the PGY -2 year of residency training. Failure to pass Step III by December 31st may result in a formal letter of non -renewal of contract for the upcoming academic year. 6. No resident may advance into PGY -3 of training unless the resident has passed Step III. H. Resident Rotations Outside of the School of Medicine's Participating Sites 1. To provide additional educational experiences or assignments, residents may, occasionally, be permitted to rotate to a residency pro gram outside of Tulane Medical Center and/or other School of Medicine participating sites. All external rotations must be approved by the resident's Program Director. 2. To receive training credit for external rotations, the rotation must be at an ACGME -approved training location and the rotation must be under the supervision of an ACGME -accredited residency program. Because School of Medicine resident salaries and benefits (including malpractice insurance) are paid by the hospital at which the resident rotate s, salary and benefits are not paid for rotations outside of School of Medicine affiliated hospitals/institutions. Therefore, a resident seeking to do a rotation at an external training location is responsible for ensuring that their salary and benefits, i ncluding malpractice insurance, is paid for by the receiving training location or 12 another external source. Residents may choose to forgo salary/benefits during this time, or use vacation time to support an external rotation; however, the resident is still responsible for confirming, and verifying to the Program Director and GME Office upon request, that the resident will have professional liability insurance for the entire rotation at the external site. 3. The School of Medicine will not authorize the transfe r of any of its resident FTE caps to support a resident's external rotation. I. Auxiliary Learners 1. Auxiliary learners are learners that are not residents in the residency program, but include residents from other specialties and/or residency programs, subspecialty fellows, PhD students, pharmacology students, nurse practitioners and other health care le arners. Auxiliary learners must enhance and not interfere with the education of residents appointed in the residency program. 2. Program must report circumstances when the presence of other learners interferes with the residents' education to the DIO and to the GMEC. 3. The Program Director must approve the presence of all auxiliary learners. If, in the Program Director's discretion, the presence of auxiliary learners dilutes or compromises the training of residents in their residency program, the Program Direct or may end the participation of auxiliary learners within the training environment. J. External Resident Rotations at a School of Medicine Participating Site 1. External rotators are residents who are currently enrolled in an ACGME -accredited residency program at a sponsoring institution other than the School of Medicine. 2. The Program Director of the School of Medicine residency program in which the external rotator seeks to rotate and the GME Office must approve the external rotation to ensure that the presence of the external rotator enhances and does not disrupt the educational experience of the residency program's appointed residents. 3. The external rotator's sponsoring institution must financially support the rotator, including salary, benefits, and professional liability insurance, while the resident is rotating in a School of Medicine sponsored residency program. a. If the external rotator's sponsoring institution is seeking Medicare GME payments for the external rotator, the graduate medical educ ation office for the external rotator must arrange a resident FTE cap transfer with the hospital at which the resident will rotate. The rotation terms and the corresponding payments will be exchanged between the external rotator's sponsoring institution an d the hospital. The role of the GME Office is approve the rotation, not to facilitate the contract between the external rotator's sponsoring institution and the hospital. b. If the external rotator's sponsoring institution is not seeking Medicare GME paymen ts for the external resident, the external resident's sponsoring institution must assume all financial responsibility for the resident, including salary, benefits and malpractice insurance. 4. The procedure for an external rotator to apply for a rotation with in the School of Medicine is as follows: a. The receiving Program Director must approve the rotation; 13 b. The DIO and GME Office must be informed of how the external rotator will be funded and must approve the rotation; c. The receiving Program Coordinator will b e responsible for the appropriate credentialing of the resident for their respective rotation(s), which will include: i. Verification of approval from the external rotator's sponsoring institution; ii. Verification of malpractice insurance; iii. Assuring the appropr iate orientation for the hospital/clinic rotations at which the external rotator will rotate; iv. Completing appropriate forms (TB testing, etc.) as required by the hospital at which the external rotator will rotate; v. Obtaining a hospital ID card; vi. Arranging for parking/beeper and other required amenities; vii. Ensuring the external rotator has been traine d in all applicable School of Medicine and affiliated hospital policies, including but not limited to, HIPAA training and compliance and Electronic Medical Record (EMR) training; viii. Ensuring appropriate evaluation forms are returned to the rotator's sponsor ing institution; and ix. Communicating with the hospital at which the external rotator will rotate that the resident is currently rotating with the residency program and ensuring that the hospital has all necessary forms/credentials. 5. Once the external rotator has complied with these procedures, for the purposes of hospital credentialing, the external rotator will be considered a part of the residency program for the time that the external rotator rotates at the School of Medicine affiliated hospital. All Schoo l of Medicine policies and procedures that apply to School of Medicine residents apply to external rotators during the rotator's time with the School of Medicine, including, but not limited to, grievance and supervision policies. 6. As stated above, the GME Office is not responsible for the credentialing of an external rotator. The receiving Program Coordinator and Program Director have this responsibility. 7. Programs must report circumstances when the presence of an external rotator interferes with the residents' education to the DIO and to the GMEC. K. Residents not in ACGME -accredited programs 1. Post residency or fellowship trainee are trainees who have previously completed their residency in an ACGME -accredited program who are now seeking to engage in additiona l clinical training for which there is no ACGME -accredited program (e.g., fellows seeking additional clinical training outside of ACGME -accredited training programs). 2. The procedure and policies for a non -accredited trainee to participate in a residency pro gram is as follows: 14 a. The trainee must receive prior approval from the Program Director. The Program Director is responsible for ensuring that the non -accredited trainee's presence enhances and does not disrupt the educational experience of the residents in the residency program; b. The DIO must approve the non -accredited trainee's participation in the residency program; c. The non-accredited trainee must be credentialed by the credentialing committee for the hospital at which the non -accredited trainee will rot ate. Credentialing of non -accredited trainees is the responsibility of the hospital credentialing committee and not the responsibility of the GME Office. The GME Office will provide no verification of training for non -accredited trainees; d. The departmental Chair is responsible for ensuring that the non -accredited trainee complies with all applicable School of Medicine and affiliated hospital policies, including but not limited to, HIPAA training and compliance; e. Non-accredited trainees are the responsibilit y of the sponsoring department and residency program and not of the GME Office or any other residency program. Non -accredited trainees will not be provided financial compensation or benefits, including malpractice and health insurance, by the School of Med icine; and f. The rights afforded to residents in residency programs are not extended to non -accredited trainees, including but not limited to, due process and grievance. Applicable rights are the responsibility of the sponsoring department. Non -accredited trainees may be removed from a rotation at any time, at the discretion of the Program Director or the DIO, if their presence is found to diminish the educational experience of residents in an accredited program. g. Programs must report circumstances when the presence of a non-accredited trainee interferes with the residents' education to the DIO and to the GMEC. L. Observers 1. Observers are trainees who have not completed nor are they enrolled in an ACGME -accredited residency program. 2. Observers may participate in a residency program as follows: a. The observer must receive prior approval from the Program Director. The Program Director is responsible for ensuring that the observer's presence does not disrupt the educational experience of the residents in the residency program; b. A School of Medicine faculty member must agree to sponsor the observer. The sponsoring faculty member is responsible for ensuring that the observer is in compliance with School of Medicine, hospital and Tulane University policies and procedures; c. The DIO must approve the observer's participation in the residency program; d. Observers may not participate in clinical decision making or provision of patient care. The observer's role is simply to observe the provision of patient care, similar to the participation of medical school students on rotations; e. Observers are not employees of the School of Medicine, instead: i. The School of Medicine will not provide financial compensation or benefits, including professional liability insurance, to observers; 15 ii. The rights afforde d to Tulane employees and residents, including but not limited to, due process and grievance, are not extended to observers; and iii. Participating as an observer is a privilege and may be revoked without cause for any reason, including but not limited to, fai lure to comply with the standards noted in this section; and f. Observers will not be offered credit towards residency requirements. 3. Residency programs may not charge observers for their participation. M. Institutional Oversight 1. In fulfilling institutional oversight responsibilities, the GMEC, directly and through applicable GMEC subcommittees, will monitor residency program compliance with this Policy. IV.

Policy on Accommodations for Disabilities Revised 12/15/2021 ____________________________________________________________________________ I. References In accordance with Section IV.I.4 of the ACGME Institutional Requirements, the Sponsoring Institution must have a policy, not necessarily GME -specific, regarding a ccommodations for disabilities consistent with all applicable laws and regulations. II. Policy The School of Medicine (the \"School of Medicine\") is committed to a diverse and inclusive community and seeks to ensure access to its programs and activities to the broadest audience possible. As part of Tulane University (\"Tulane\"), the School of Medici ne complies with federal and state laws concerning the employment of people with disabilities, including Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and complies with regulations issued by the Equal Employm ent Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The School of Medicine follows Tulane's disability and accommodation policies that ensure reasonable accommodations for qualifying individuals. The policies, which extend to residents and fellows (each a \"resident\"), as well as other individuals, are available online at: https://equity.tulane.edu/report - claim/policies within Tulane's Equal Opportunity/Anti -Discrimination Policies. Consistent with the Equal Opportunity/Anti -Discrimination Policies, the School of Medicine's policy is to reasonably accommodate qualified individuals with disabilities when accommodation is necessary to allow an individual to compete for a position, perform the essential function s of a position (including a resident or fellow position), and/or enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment, where the accommodation would not impose an undue hardship on Tulane. The Equal Opportunity/Anti -Discrimination Policies also contain in formation related to Equal Employment and Educational Opportunity, Anti -Discrimination, and other rights and processes for residents, faculty, and staff. For additional information related to The Equal Opportunity/Anti -Discrimination Policies and/or for requesting a reasonable accommodation, residents and fellows, as well as faculty and staff, may contact the Tulane University Office of Human Resources & Institutional Equity at (504) 862 -8083 or oie@tulane.edu , or visit the Disability & Accommodations webpage at: https://hr.tulane.edu/disability -accommodations .

Policy on Closure, Reduction or Expansion of Programs or the Sp onsoring Institution Revised 12/15/2021 ___________________________________________________________________________ I. References In accordance with Section IV.O of the ACGME Institutional Requirements, the Sponsoring Institution must maintain a policy that addresses GMEC oversight of reductions in size or closure of each of its ACGME-accredited programs, or closure of the Sponsoring Institution that includes the following: (i) the Sponsoring Institution must inform the GMEC, DIO and affected residents/fellows as soon as possible when it intends to reduce the size of or close one or more ACGME -accredited programs, or when the Sponsoring Institution intends to close; and (ii) the Sponsoring Institution must allow residents/fellows already in an affected ACGME -accredited program(s) to complete their education at the Sponsoring Institution, or assist them in enrolling in (an)other ACGME -accredited program(s) in which they can continue their education. II. Policy A. Program Reduction 1. In the event that the School of Medicine decides that it is necessary to reduce the size of a residency program, including if a participating site reduces the funding for a program's residency positions, the GMEC, DIO and affected residents will be notified as soon as possible and the GMEC will provide oversight of all processes related to the reduction. 2. If reasonably possible, the School of Medicine , in collaboration with the affected residency program(s), will allow current residents in affected program(s) to complete their residency at the School of Medicine. The School of Medicine will work to replace resident training at another institution affi liated with the School of Medicine that can meet the educational requirements for the residents in the residency program. 3. If it is not possible for affected residents to complete their residency at the School of Medicine, the DIO, GMEC and affected Progra m Director(s) must assist the residents in enrolling in another ACGME -accredited program(s), in which the residents can continue their education. 4. If educational opportunities are sufficient for a reduced complement of residents, the affected program(s) will work with the GMEC and DIO to decrease the incoming class for the residency program. B. Program and Institutional Closure 1. In the event that the School of Medicine decides to close or if the School of Medicine determines to close a residency program, the GMEC, DIO and affected residents will be notified as soon as possible, and the GMEC will provide oversight of all processes related to the closure. 2. If reasonably possible, residents in the affected programs will be allowed to complete their education at the School of Medicine as long as educational opportunities consistent with accreditation continue to exist. 3. If it is not possible for affected resid ents to complete their residency at the School of Medicine, the 18 DIO, GMEC and affected Program Director(s) must assist the residents in enrolling in another ACGME-accredited program(s) in which the residents can continue their education. 4. Closure policies and procedures in response to a disaster, including policies on the temporary and/or permanent transfer of residents due to a disaster, are addressed in the Policy on Disaster/Interruption of Resident Training . C. Program Expansio n 1. Expansion of a residency program's permanent or temporary resident complement must be approved by the GMEC and all complement increases (temporary and permanent) must be approved by the program's ACGME Review Committee, which may specify minimum or maximum complement numbers. 2. GMEC review and approval will be based on the educational opportunities the program is able to afford residents along with financial resources available for an increase in resident complement, as verified by the Program Director to the DIO and the Office of Graduate Medical Education . Program Directors must not appoint more residents to their residency program than approved by the residency program's ACGME Review Committee and educational resources for each residency program must be adequate to support the number of residents in the program. 3. To initiate an increase in resident complement, the following documents and information are required to be completed and submitted to the GME Office, for review and consideration by the DIO and G MEC: a. A written request addressed to the DIO and GMEC that includes: i. The current resident complement in the residency program, the ACGME complement cap for the residency program, the requested number of expansion positions and a prospectus of the residency program's size for each of the future \"x\" number of years. \"X\" is defined as the duration of the residency program; and ii. A clear educational rationale for an increase in the complement, which shall include: 1) the educational opportunities (i.e., pa tient volume) that currently exists that did not previously exist (or may not have existed) for the residents in the program; 2) the faculty supervision that currently exists that did not previously exist for the residents in the residency program, and a cur rent list of the faculty in the residency program; 3) the impact expansion/an increase in residency size (or failure to expand) will have on the education of the residents already in the residency program. This should include commentary on how the expansion/i ncrease in residency size will or will not dilute the educational experience of the residents currently in the program and how the expansion may impact the work hours of residents; and 4) a current rotation schedule for the residents in the residency program and how this rotation schedule may change if additional residents are added to the residency program. b. If the residency program is required by its Review Committee and/or the ACGME to submit case logs for board certification, it should also include in the information submitted to the GME Office: 19 i. case logs for residents currently in the residency program; ii. case logs for the resident class that most recently graduated from the residency program; iii. institutional data for faculty procedures from Tulane Medical Center and participating sites; and iv. an explanation on how case logs will be maintained for all residents in the residency program if the complement increase is approved; c. The residency program's most recent ACGME accreditation letter, including if applicable, all citations and program responses to these citations, and how an increase in the resident complement may affect these citations; d. The most recent ACGME resident surv ey; e. A prospectus on how the additional resident(s) will be funded; and f. Any additional materials required by the Review Committee for the residency program's specialty. 4. Following the DIO's review of the residency program's materials and making a recommenda tion as to whether the residency program's complement should be increased, completed applications to increase the resident complement will be brought before the GMEC. The GMEC will then vote as to whether it approves that a request be submitted to the ACGM E Review Committee for the residency program complement to be increased. 5. If the application is approved by both the DIO and the GMEC, the DIO will endorse the residency program's complement change request. III. References/Associated Policies Tulane Univ ersity School of Medicine, Graduate Medical Education IV. Policy on Disaster/Interruption of Resident Training 20 IV. Policy on Disaster/Interruption of Residency Training A. Subject to Tulane University School of Medicine's policy regarding closures and reductions of training programs, in the event of a disaster or an event that causes the interruption of resident training , the Tulane University School of Medicine has adopted the following policy related to its res idents. 1. The Office of Graduate School Medical Education will annually collect/update emergency contact information from all House Officers each spring. 2. The GME office will annually send out emails to residents with emergency information. 3. Tulane will continue to provide administrative support that may include continued payment of salary and benefits depending on the overall circumstances, scope and duration of the Emergency, subject to Tulane's Policy on Residency Training Program Closure or R eduction. 4. In the event of an Emergency, Tulane will work closely with the ACGME and other accrediting bodies to ensure that minimal interruption occurs in a House Officer's training experience and that House Officers are transferred (if needed) tempora rily or permanently, to new sites. 5. In the event of an Emergency, Tulane will assess, in consultation with the appropriate accrediting bodies, whether certain programs may need to be temporarily or permanently withdrawn in order to ensure a quality tra ining experience. B. Hurricane -specific Policies 1. Hurricane Watch - a. Upon a Hurricane Watch, the GME office will ensure that all files related to current residents are portable via electronic storage . This will include information vital for resid ent and fellow credentialing, licensing and transfer. b. The GME office will contact each residency program administrator. The office will ensure that each program coordinator has a portable electronic version of all resident/fellow files containing information vital for resident and fellow credentialing, licensing and transfer. The office will ensure that the program administrator has up -to-date emergency contact information for each resident, including a non -university email account through which the res ident/fellow can be contacted in the event of an emergency. c. The DIO will contact each program director and confirm that the program director has communicated the warning to his or her residents. For applicable programs, the DIO will ensure that the pr ogram director is prepared to activate his or her program's Code Grey or Code Cloud plan. 2. Code Cloud (Tropical Storm or Hurricane Category 1 or 2 ) a. A Code Cloud will be called for an impending Tropical Storm, or Category 1 or 2 Hurricane. b. Upon activation of a Code Cloud, the hospital administrations will notify the Dean and the DIO. c. The DIO will then contact each program director and the dep artment chair and instruct him or her to provide the names of the individuals, as specified below, who will be providing coverage on the day of the Code Cloud activation, and the day following the Code Cloud activation. d. The DIO will then inform the ho spitals of the personnel who will be providing coverage. 21 e. Principles of the Code Cloud i. The goal of the Code Cloud Coverage is to ensure the on -going operation of the hospital for two days surrounding the storm, without burdening the hospital wi th excessive staff or residents. ii. The presumption underlying the Code Cloud is that access to the hospital immediately following the storm may be impaired; ensuring the next day's clinical services will be addressed proactively by housing the next day's te ams in the hospital prior to the storm . iii. As opposed to a Code Grey, a Code Cloud assumes that the damage from the storm will not be sufficiently severe to warrant mandatory city evacuations, nor prolonged hospital stays for the faculty and staff. As s uch, there is a greater degree of comfort in selecting residents and faculty who are already on the call schedule. iv. Staying with the call schedule ensures a less disruptive and more effect \"re -entry\" following the storm's abatement ( i.e., residents' ca ll cycle frequency and duty hours are not disrupted). f. While the Code Cloud Coverage operates on pre -existing call schedule coverage, program directors and chairs should make suitable substitutions for personnel who, due to life issues (i .e., child care, etc.), cannot afford to be in the hospital for 48 hours. g. Essential services i. Residents on -call for essential services (as defined below) will report on the day of the activation of the Code Cloud (as they ordinarily would ), and will be provided housing on the day of call, and the day following call in the event that they cannot return home following the storm. ii. Residents that are pre -call for essential services (as defined below) will also report on the day of the activation of the C ode Cloud (their pre -call day), and will be provided housing on the day prior to their call day, and the day of their call day. iii. Essential services wi ll include the following. Personnel for these services will consist of the previously scheduled on-call team, the pre -call team, and faculty for these two teams. A listing of Code Cloud departmental assignments is in Appendix E . a). General internal medicine b). Intensive care medicine c). General surgery d). General pediatrics (Lakeside only) e). Pediatric ICU (Lakeside only) f). OB/Gyn (Lakeside only) h. Precautionary Services. Services for which the hospital must have access, but are not imminently necessary, will be provided by faculty (at the numbers listed below) but not residents. These services include the following. A listing of Code Cloud departmental assignments is in Appendix E i. Ophthalmology ( will sign-out their patients to the General Surgery Service) (1 faculty at Tulane; 1 faculty at UMC/VA) 22 ii. Urology ( will sign-out their p atients to the General Surgery Service) (1 faculty at Tulane; 1 faculty at UMC/VA) iii. Orthopaedics ( will sign-out their patients to the General Surgery Service) (1 faculty at Tulane; 1 faculty at UMC/VA) iv. Otolaryngology ( will sign-out their patients to the General Surgery Service) (1 faculty at Tulane; 1 faculty at UMC/VA) v. Neurosurgery ( will sign-out their patients to the General Surgery Service) (1 faculty at Tulane) vi. Nephrology (1 faculty at Tulane; 1 faculty at UMC/VA) vii. Gastroenterology (1 faculty at Tulane; 1 faculty at UMC/VA) viii. Interventional cardiology (CCU teams will sign out their patients to the medical ICU Service. (1 faculty at Tulane; 1 faculty at UMC/VA) ix. Interventional Radiology (1 faculty at Tulane) x. Diagnostic Ra diology (1 faculty at Tulane) xi. Anesthesia (2 faculty at Tulane) i. Non-essential services will not have residents or faculty present, but faculty will be available for telephone consultation. These include: i. Pathology and Pathology Fellowships ii. Psychiatry iii. Allergy/Immunology iv. Endocrinology v. Infectious Diseases vi. Child Psychiatry vii. Preventive Medicine viii. Neurology ( will sign-out their patients to the General Medicine Service) ix. Hematology/Oncology ( will sign-out their patients to the General Medicine Service) x. Dermatology xi. Hepatology ( will sign-out their patients to the General Surgery Service) j. Call rooms will for all in -house personnel will be assigned proactively ahead of the Code Cloud activation, a nd will be on -file with the DIO. k. Once the storm has passed and access to the hospital is assured to be safe, the Code Cloud will be lifted. Hospital leadership will inform the DIO, who will then inform the residents and faculty. Access to the hospital s will be allowed for all personnel as it is deemed to be safe. 3. Code Grey Army (Hurricane Category 3 or above ) a. A Code Grey will be called for an impending Hurricane Category 3 or above . b. Upon activation of a Code Grey, the hospital administrations will notify the Dean and the DIO. 23 c. The DIO will then contact each program director and the department chair to ensure that the previously provided names for the Code Grey Army (as provided on July 1st of each academic yea r) are accurate. d. The DIO will then inform the hospitals of the personnel who will be providing coverage. e. Principles of the Code Grey Army i. The goal of the Code Grey Army is to ensure the on -going operation of the hospital for three to four days surrounding the storm. ii. Like a Code Cloud, the goal is to provide necessary person without burdening the hospital with excessive staff or residen ts. Unlike a Code Cloud, it is possible that all personnel will require evacuation, and will consume more resources (food, water) because of a prolonged hospital stay. As such, it is imperative that the necessary number of people are present, but not more than that. iii. The presumption underlying the Code Grey is that a prolonged hospital stay is to be expected. As such, Code Grey personnel should be proactively selected such that the right personnel capable of handling the assignment are chosen. Each program is to choose personnel for the Code Grey Army by July 1st of each academic year. iv. As opposed to a Code Cloud, a Code Grey assumes that the damage from the storm will be sufficiently severe to warrant mandatory city evacuations. Because all per sonnel on the Code Grey Army have been proactively chosen (as of July 1st of each academic year), residents not on the Code Grey Army therefore have the luxury of timely and safe evacuation from the city. v. Because a Code Grey Army assignment has a reas onable probability of executing patient evacuations, the Code Grey Army should be selected in sufficient advance to become trained in the hospital policies regarding patient evacuation policies and procedures. f. The goal of the Code Grey Army is to ensure the emergent operation of the hospital for up to 4 days surrounding the storm. Because this will be an extended tour of duty, programs and departments must proactively choose personnel for this assignment (i.e., personnel should not be assign ed arbitrarily by who is on service for that month, or who is on call for those days). Directors and chairs should follow the following principles in selecting personnel i. No resident may be conscripted into service. Only residents volunteering for duty should be selected. ii. It is preferable to not choose residents and faculty with dependent children or adults whose hospital service during the Code Grey would thus be compromised because of concerns for their family. iii. It is preferable to not choose residents and faculty with medical issues that could be compromised by an extended stay in the hospital iii. The GME office recognizes that not every resident is equally prepared to endure the responsibilities required of disaster duty. From the pool of volunteers, the director and chair should choose personnel who they believe will have the mental stamina to endure up to four days in the hospital. 24 iv. Interns should not be chosen for Code Grey assignments; by definition of the hurricane season (July-November), they will lack sufficient familiarity with the hospital system, and cannot provide the necessary procedures that upper -level residents can perform. v. Programs should anticipate that those selected to be on the disaster team might not be availa ble during the disaster (due to vacations, etc.). Programs should select and train two people for each position to which they are assigned. Those not assigned during an emergency situation will constitute the \"Relief Team\" as outlined below. Programs are required to submit their Code Grey roster to the GME Office prior to the onset of hurricane season (July 1st). g. Essential services . Essential services will include the following. Personnel for these services will consist of the previously scheduled on -call team, the pre -call team, and faculty for these two teams. A listing of Code Grey Army departmental assignments is in Appendix E . i. General internal medicine ii. Intensive care medicine iii. General surgery iv. General pediatrics (Lakeside only) v. Pediatric ICU (Lakeside only) vi. OB/Gyn (Lakeside only) h. Precautionary Services. These are s ervices for which the hospital must have access, but are not imminently necessary . As a general rule, surgical services will consolidate their patients onto the general surgery s ervice for on -going management through the hurricane; neurology and medical subspecialty services will consolidate their patients onto the general medicine service for on -going management through the hurricane. A listing of Code Grey Army departmental assi gnments is in Appendix E i. Ophthalmology ( will sign-out their patients to the General Surgery Service) ii. Urology ( will sign-out their patients to the General Surgery Service) iii. Orthopaedics ( will sign-out their patients to the General Surgery Service) iv. Otolaryngology ( will sign-out their patients to the General Surgery Service) v. Neurosurgery ( will sign-out their patients to the General Surgery vi. Nephrology vii. Gastroenterology viii. Interventional cardiology ( CCU teams will sign out their patients to the medica l ICU Service ). ix. Interventional Radiology x. Diagnostic Radiology xi. Anesthesia i. Non-essential services will not have residents or faculty present, but faculty will be available for telephone consultation. These include: i. Pathology and Pathology Fellowships 25 ii. Psychiatry iii. Allergy/Immunology iv. Endocrinology v. Infectious Diseases vi. Child Psychiatry vii. Preventive Medicine viii. Neurology ( will sign-out their patients to the General Medicine Service) ix. Hematology/Oncology ( will sign-out their patients to the General Medicine Service) x. Dermatology xi. Hepatology ( will sign-out their patients to the General Surgery Service) j. The Activation Team. Once a hurricane warning has been called, the Activatio n Team will be deployed to their respective stations. All other residents will sign -out their patients to the activation team residents, and then depart the city. If a full evacuation of all patients in the hospital is required, the Activation Team will se quentially accompany the evacuated patients to evacuation centers per hospital protocol. k. The Relief Team. Each program will be asked to proactively assign residents and faculty to a Relief Team. For simplicity, the composition of the relief team shoul d match the activation team. Interns may be used for the relief team. Once a Code Grey has been called, the Relief Team will begin preparations to evacuate to Jackson , Mississippi. Hotel or dormitory rooms will be provided by the University for designated Relief Team members. i. Relief team members will remain in Jackson until they are activated to return to New Orleans. At which time, the relief team will convoy to New Orleans. ii. The Activation Team will subsequently be relieved of their duties. The Ac tivation Team will convoy to Jackson unless the city has been deemed safe for inhabitation, in which case they will be free to return to their homes. iii. If a full evacuation of all patients in the hospital is required, the Relief Team will be directed to evacuation centers to provide relief for the activation team. l. As with a Code Cloud, program directors and chairs will instruct all students, residents, and faculty who have not been designated as the Code Cloud Army to stay away from the hospital facilities until the Code Grey has been lifted. 4. All programs are required to provide emergency contact information (cell phone numbers, secondary email addresses, and preferred relocation destinations) for all residents. 26 SECTION 2: RESIDENT SUPPORT & CURRICULUM 27 V. Policy on Financial & Resource Support of Residents A. Parking is provided for residents assigned to UMC, TMC, and SLVHCS (VA NO) at the downtown medical campus, and through individual affiliated training locations as specified in affiliatio n agreements. 1. All residents will be provided parking at the downtown medical campus. 2. Select programs will be provided additional parking for residents at UMC and the SLVHCS (VANO). a. These positions are prioritized for programs that have : i. Prolonged shifts in the hospital (whereby they would be leaving at odd hours of the night when the shuttles do not run), ii. Programs that are already up again st the 80 hour/week duty limit, such that waiting for shuttles on the afferent and efferent side of transportation would risk non-compliance with the 80 hour limit. 3. For residents that do not have additional parking at UMC and the VA, a shuttle service will be provided that rotates on a downtown -only campus loop. a. Shuttle times can be found at http://www. shuttles.tulane.edu b. Residents can access the PassioGo app for real -time GPS shuttle locations and the TAP -RIDE app, which enable s a resident to request a shuttle on the downtown medical campus when needed. c. Residents can access the Everbridge app which provides safety information and enables residents to request a virtual safety escort regardless of method of transportat ion. https://publicsafety.tulane.edu/rave -guardian 4. Residents coming into the VA or UMC after hours , or those on a service where they are eme rgently called over to the hospital for an emergent procedure/operation , can stop by the security desk next to the ED and get their parking validated for a free exit. B. Pagers are provided for the duration of the residencies. Each resident is responsibl e for returning the pager at the completion or termination of training; a seventy ($70) dollar charge will be accessed for lost or stolen pagers. The GME Office provides each program with an adequate number of pagers; distribution is the responsibility of the program coordinators. C. Technology Services Support. Tulane University provides free informational and tech support for all resident/faculty computer questions/assistance through the Technology Services Help Desk ( 504-988-8888). 1. Each resident is given an email account and password, providing 24-hour access to educational material s on the Tulane University website, including on -line streaming video of important lectures , and the Tulane Library. Through the Tulane Library website, residents have 24 -hour access to Up -to-Date, Medline, Ovid, DynaMed Program, and Exammaster. These serv ices provide access to full -text journal subscriptions as well as other on -line medical textbooks, providing access to specialty -specific and other appropriate reference material in print as well as electronic format. 2. On-line evaluation services are pro vided at no charge for each resident, allowing for the convenience of at-home evaluation review and completion. 3. Each resident is provided HIP AA training as a part of the orientation, and after completing this training, can receive additional training a t no cost to learn how to access the electronic medical records of the three primary training locations at Tulane: UMC (EPIC), TMC (Meditech and E-Clinical Works ) and the VA (CPRS). For residents enrolled off -cycle, it is the responsibility of the sponsor ing training program to 28 ensure that the resident has received appropriate HIPPA training at each clinical institution through which he or she will rotate. Residents will be required to complete HIPAA training annually. 4. Each call room is to contain a te lephone and a computer, to ensure 24 -hour access to the medical literature and educational resources necessary for optimal learning and patient care, as well as access to the electronic medical record of the hospital in which the resident is providing pati ent care. D. Each hospital in which residents perform inpatient and home -call care must have the following components: 1. Safe, quiet, and private sleep/rest facilities for those residents on call . Each call room must have access to a computer and a telephone. 2. Each facility must offer 24-hour access to food for those residents who are on -duty at that location. 3. Security and safety measures appropriate to the participating site. E. Simulation Center. Each resident i s offered access to Tulane University's simulation center at no additional cost. F. Health Insurance is provided to residents at no cost. Family health coverage is available at an additional cost to the resident. Health insurance eligibility is available to the resident on the first date that the resident is to report for employment, as specified in the resident contract. G. Optional dental and/or vision insurance is available to residents and their families at an additional cost . Dental and vision i nsurance eligibility is available to the resident on the first date that the resident is to report for employment, as specified in the resident contract. H. Life & Disability Insurance - A $25,000 life insurance policy is provided at no cost to residents. Su pplemental insurance may be purchased by the resident. Disability insurance is provided at no cost to the residents. Life and disability insurance eligibility is available to the resident on the first date that the resident is to report for employment, as specified in the resident contract. I. Malpractice insurance is provided at no cost to the residents through the Office of the General Counsel. Tulane residents are included in the Self -Insurance Trust Program for professional liability coverage (Occurrenc e Coverage). Under the following circumstances, this coverage is secondary to coverage that is otherwise provided. Official documentation of the details of liability coverage are available to the resident at the request of the individual. Any questions about the coverage addressed below can be addressed to the Director of Risk Management for Tulane University (504-865-5783) or the Office of Associate General Counsel for the Health Sciences Center (504 -988-5031). 1. Private Healthcare Institutions within the State. Under the Tulane coverage, the first $100,000 is covered by Tulane ; the remaining $400,000 (up to the statutory limit of $500,000) is provided through the Patient's Compensation Fund. As a safety net in case the statutory cap is removed , the Tulane Self - Insurance Trust program provides an additional $900,000 coverage under a separate policy. The coverage provided by Tulane through its Self -Insurance Trust and through the Patient's Compensation Fund is an occurrence -based coverage and the refore when residents leave Tulane, no tail coverage would be required. 2. Rotations at State -operated Facilities. Residents are provided coverage through the State Malpractice Program. This is statutory coverage that provides that health care providers, incl uding residents, who treat patients at any of the state institutions are considered State employees and the State is liable for their conduct. UMC is now a privately -operated facility and, therefore, the above provision #1 will apply. 3. Veterans Administrati on Rotation. Those Residents on rotation within the VA system are considered covered under the Federal Tort Claims Act and therefore would be immune from any personal liability. In those situations, the federal government is obligated to provide the cost o f defense and the satisfaction of 29 any judgments and/or settlements. 4. In all of the above cases, insurance is available to the resident on the first date of employment, as specified in the resident contract. 5. Out of State Rotations. The primary coverage is determined pursuant to the affiliation agreement between Tulane and the affiliate institution. Residents would have primary coverage by the Tulane program , which includes a Self -Insurance component and/or coverage under a commercial insurance p olicy purchased by the University. 6. Moonlighting. Tulane does not provide any coverage for moonlighting activities of a resident. J. Vacations & Educational Leave - With the approval of the program director, educational leave is allowed in some programs as outlined in Policy on Vacation and Leave Each resident is allowed no less than three (3) weeks of vacation per academic year. Additional weeks are at the discretion of the each residency program. K. Annual resident and fellow salaries for July 1, 2022 - June 30, 2023: $70,196 L. Counseling Services and Physician Impairment Resources. Tulane University is committed to fostering an environment in which residents feel safe in identifying and correcting academic and professional deficiencies without fear of reprisal or implications to their career. Residents are provided confidential counseling and behavioral health services, at no cost to the resident, as outlined in Chapter XV. Policy on Remediation, Suspension, Termination and Grievance , and Chapter XVI. Residents' Assistance Program and Resident Wellness. Residents are not reported to licensing agencies or The Tulane Administration for self -referral except in the extenuating circumstances as noted in Chapter XV. Policy on Remediation, Suspension, Termination and Grievance . M. Other Program Personnel and Support Services . The DIO, on behalf of the Sponsoring Institution, the respective chair and program director must jointly ensure : 1. The availability of all necessary professional, technical, and clerical personnel for the e ffective administration of the program. 2. The appropriate number of program coordinator(s) to sustain the effective operation of the training program. P rogram coordinators must have sufficient support and time to effectively carry out their responsibilit ies. 3. The availability of adequate resources for resident education, including space, technology, and supplies, are available to provide effective support for ACGME -accredited programs. 4. All clinical rotations have support services to minimize reside nts' work that is extraneous to their ACGME-accredited programs' educational goals and objectives 5. Residents' educational experience is not compromised by excessive reliance on residents to fulfill non - physician service obligations. These support servic es and systems must include: a. Peripheral intravenous access placement, phlebotomy, laboratory, pathology and radiology services and patient transportation services provided in a manner appropriate to and consistent with educational objectives and to sup port high quality and safe patient care; 30 b. Medical records available at all participating sites to support high quality and safe patient care, residents' education, quality improvement and scholarly activities. 31 VI. Policy on Moonlighting Revised 12-21-2021 ____________________________________________________________________________ I. References In accordance with Section IV.K.1 of the ACGME Institutional Requirements, the Sponsoring Institution must have a policy on moonlighting. Residents shall not be required to engage in moonlighting and residents must have written permission from their Program Director to moonlight. All ACGME -accredited programs are required to monitor the effect of moonlighting activities on a re sident's performance in the program, including that adverse effects may lead to withdrawal of permission to moonlight. The Sponsoring Institution or any of its ACGME -accredited programs may prohibit moonlighting by residents. II. Definitions 1. Moonlightin g: voluntary, compensated, medically -related work, performed beyond a resident or fellow's clinical experience and education requirements, including education hours, and additional to the work required for successful completion of a residency program. Moon lighting includes: a. External Moonlighting : voluntary, compensated, medically -related work performed outside the site where the resident or fellow is in training and any of its related participating sites. b. Internal Moonlighting : voluntary, compensated, medically -related work performed within the site where the resident or fellow is in training or at any of its related participating sites. Internal Moonlighting may have particular procedures or definitions specific to individual residency programs, not inconsistent with this definition. 2. Resident: an individual enrolled in a graduate medical education residency program sponsored by Tulane University School of Medicine. For purposes of this Policy and the School of Medicine's additional GME Policies, \"resident\" includes \"fellows\", individuals enrol led in a fellowship (subspecialty) program sponsored by the School of Medicine who has completed a residency program in a related specialty. III. Moonlighting Requirement s 1. All residency programs must have a written policy regarding Moonlighting that ident ifies whether or not the residency program allows residents to Moonlight and, if a residency program permits Moonlighting, eligibility for Moonlighting and applicable parameters (including maintenance of acceptable performance). Each residency program poli cy must be in compliance with this Policy, relevant state and federal laws and regulations and any applicable ACGME Institutional, Common Program, Specialty/Subspecialty and Residency Review Committee Requirements. A residency program's Moonlighting policy may be more restrictive, but not less restrictive, than this Policy. 2. No PGY-1 resident may be permitted to Moonlight. 3. A resident may not Moonlight if the resident holds a J -1 visa or if Moonlighting is otherwise restricted under the terms of the resident 's visa, as applicable. 4. Residents are not permitted to wear any article of clothing that could connect the resident to the Sponsoring Institution while participating in External Moonlighting, including but not limited to, white coats or scrubs that have \"Tulane University School of Medicine\" or a residency program name, logo, or emblem on them. 5. Programs may not require residents to engage in Moonlighting. Tulane University School of Medicine and/or any of its residency programs may prohibit Moonlighting at any time. 6. A resident who wishes to engage in Moonlighting, whether Internal Moonlighting o r External 32 Moonlighting, must be in good standing and receive written approval from his/her Program Director. The Program Director's written permission must be included in the resident's training record maintained by the residency program with a copy to th e GME Office. A resident seeking to Moonlight must obtain approval at least each academic year from the resident's Program Director, or more frequently as set by program policy. 7. Moonlighting must be conducted in compliance with relevant state and federal laws and regulations. All residents who engage in Moonlighting must have all licenses and registrations necessary to engage in Moonlighting, including Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) licenses or registrations. Residents may only engage in approved Moonligh ting activities in the State of Louisiana. 8. Residents must also have or carry professional liability coverage extending to the resident's Moonlighting activities. Professional liability insurance coverage (including any self -insurance coverage) provided to residents by Tulane University School of Medicine or by its participating sites cannot be used by residents for the purpose of Moonlighting and such policies do not provide coverage for claims or alleged malpractice arising out of resident Moonlighting ac tivities, whether Internal or External. It is further the responsibility of the resident and the employer for which a resident is Moonlighting, to determine whether the resident has the appropriate licensure, training and skills to carry out Moonlighting d uties. 9. Moonlighting must be conducted in accordance with the established institutional principles in the Policy on Clinical and Educational Work Hours . Program Directors are responsible for monitoring the effect of Moonlighting on a resident's performance in the educational program. Hours devoted to Moonlighting must be counted toward the 80 -hour weekly work hour limit as outlined in the Policy on Clinical and Educational Work Hours . Residents are responsible for maintaining and logging accurate works hours and time spent Moonlighting. 10. Moonlighting is a privilege and it must not interfere with the ability of a resident to achieve the goals and objectives of his/her residency program and must not interfere with the resident's fitness for work nor compromise patient safety. The Moonlighting privilege may be revoked by the Program Director or by the DIO at any time, including if the Program Director or DIO believes that Moonlighting is adversely affecting the resident's ability to provide effective patient car e, adversely affecting the resident's participation in the residency program, is putting the resident at risk of a work hours violation, is causing excessive fatigue or if the resident fails to accurately report Moonlighting hours. 11.

Residents should not participate in activities or accept gifts not included on the list above without specific permission from the DIO. In addition to this Policy, residents are expected to comply with the policies on vendor interactions in effect at each hospital or other participating site to which a resident rotates. If there is discordance between this Policy and a participating site's policy, the more stringent of the two will apply. 3. Questions regarding this Policy should be directed to the resident's Program Director or the Tulane University Office of General Counsel. 34 VIII. Policy on Clinical and Educational Work Hours Revised 12/01/2021 I. References In accordance with Section IV.K of the ACGME Institutional Requirements, the Sponsoring Institution shall maintain a clinical and educational work hours policy that ensures effective oversight of institutional and program-level compliance with ACGME clinic al and educational work hour requirements. II. Purpose Each ACGME -accredited residency program sponsored by Tulane University School of Medicine is responsible for designing an effective program structure configured to provide residents with educational and clinical experiences and reasonable opportunities for rest and personal activities. Residency programs and residents are jointly responsible for ensuring that limitations on Work Hours (defined below) are not exceeded. Programs must comply with ACGME Instit utional, Common Program and Specialty/Subspecialty Requirements and with this Policy. Each residency program must be committed to, and responsible for, promoting patient safety and resident well-being and for providing a supportive and safe educational env ironment. Work Hour limitations set out in this Policy and in ACGME requirements apply regardless of the location of the rotation. Resident schedules, Work Hours and clinical and educational work periods must be structured to focus on the needs of the pati ent, continuity of care and the educational needs of the resident. Clinical and education assignments must also recognize that faculty and residents collectively have the responsibility for the safety and welfare of patients and that didactic and clinical education must have priority in the allotment of residents' time and energy to ensure that the learning objectives of each residency program for a resident are not compromised. III. Definitions 1. At-Home Call (pager call) : call taken from outside Tulane Medical Center or a residency program participating site. Clinical work done while on at -home call, including time spent in the hospital and work done at home, such as taking calls or entering notes in an electronic health record (EHR), counts against the 80-hour-per-week limit but does not restart the clock for time off between scheduled in -house clinical and educational work periods. The remaining time, free of clinical work, does not count against the 80 - hour-per week limit. At -home call may not be scheduled on a resident's One Day Off. 2. In-House Call : Clinical and Educational Work Hours, beyond the scheduled workday, when residents are required to be immediately available within an assigned site, as needed, for clinical responsibilities. In - House Call does not i nclude Night Float, being on call from home, or regularly scheduled overnight duties. 3. Moonlighting : voluntary, compensated, medically -related work, performed beyond a resident's clinical experience and education hours, and in addition to the work required for successful completion of a residency program. Moonlighting may be \"External\" (i.e., voluntary, compensated, medically -related work performed outside the site where the resident is in training and any of its related participating sites), or \"Internal\" ( i.e., voluntary, compensated, medically -related work performed within the site where the resident is in training or at any of its related participating sites). 4. Night Float : a rotation or other structured educational experience designed either to eliminate In-House Call or to assist other residents during the night. Residents assigned to night float are assigned on -site 35 duty during evening/night shifts, are responsible for admitting or cross -covering patients until morning, and do not have daytime assignment s. Such a rotation must have an educational focus. 5. One Day Off : one continuous 24 -hour period free from all administrative, clinical, and educational activities. 6. Work Hours or Clinical and Educational Work Hours : all clinical and academic activities relate d to the residency program, i.e., patient care (inpatient and outpatient), administrative duties relative to patient care, the provision for transfer of patient care, time spent on in -house call, time spent on clinical work done at home, and other schedule d academic activities, such as conferences, grand rounds, didactic sessions or other educational activities. Work Hours/Clinical and Educational Work Hours do not include reading, studying, research done from home, and preparation for future cases. IV. Work Hour Requirements A. Program Requirements All residency programs are required to ensure that Work Hours comply with the following standards . If a residency program's ACGME Specialty/Subspecialty Requirements include more restrictive limitations or standards (e.g., emergency medicine), in which case the more restrictive limitations control: 1. Each resident's Work Hours must be limited to no more than 80 hours per week, averaged over a four-week period (or averaged over the period of the rotation if it is shorter than four weeks) inclusive of all in-house clinical and educational activities, clinical work done from home, and all Moonlighting. Tulane University does not permit residency programs to apply for rotation -specific exceptions to the Work Hour requirements. 2. Resident clinical and educational work periods must be no longer than 24 hours of continuous scheduled clinical assignments. Up to four hours of additional time is permitted for activities related to patient safety; however, ad ditional patient care responsibilities cannot be assigned to a resident during this time. 3. It is expected that resident schedules will be structured to ensure that residents are provided with a minimum of eight, but preferably ten, hours off between schedu led work periods for rest and personal activities. There may be circumstances when residents choose to return to the hospital or stay to care for their patients with fewer than eight hours between clinical work and education periods. This shall occur withi n the context of the 80 -hour and One Day Off in seven requirements. 4. Each resident must have at least 14 hours off after 24 hours of In -House Call. 5. Residents must be scheduled to have at least One Day Off in seven free of clinical work and required education, averaged over a four week period. At -Home Call cannot be assigned on the One Day Off. It is desirable, but not required, that each resident have one 48 -hour period free of all clinical work and required education each month. 6. In-House Call must not be sc heduled more frequently than every third night, averaged over a four week period. 7. Night Float shall occur within the context of the 80 -hour and One Day Off in seven requirements. The maximum number of consecutive weeks of Night Float and maximum number of months of Night Float per year may be further specified by each residency program's associated ACGME Review Committee. Residency programs are required to comply with these further specifications if a program's ACGME Review Committee promulgates these addi tional limitations. 8. The frequency of At -Home Call is not subject to the every -third-night limitation, but must satisfy the 36 requirement for the One Day Off in seven that must be free of clinical work and education, averaged over a four week period. At -Home Call must not be so frequent or taxing as to preclude rest or personal time for each resident. As such, a resident on At -Home Call who is called into Tulane Medical Center or a participating site for an extensive period of time should be released from wo rk the following day. 9. Each Program Director is responsible for establishing a jeopardy system involving the residents and faculty, which ensures that the resident may be released from work the following day if the previous night's requirements were excess ive. Residents are permitted to return to Tulane Medical Center or a participating site on At -Home Call to provide direct care for new or established patients. Time spent on patient care activities on At -Home must be included in the 80 -hour maximum weekly limit. 10. Moonlighting, if permitted, cannot interfere with resident fitness for work, compromise patient safety or compromise the ability of the resident to achieve the goals and objectives of his/her residency program. Program Directors are responsible fo r ensuring all time spent Moonlighting is included as part of the 80 -hour maximum weekly limit in accordance with the graduate medical education Policy on Moonlighting . PGY-1 residents are not permitted to Moonlight. B. Fatigue Mitigation 1. Residency programs must educate all faculty members and residents on recognizing the signs of fatigue and sleep deprivation, fatigue management and strategies for alertness management and fatigue mitigation. The GME office will provide a n on-boarding session for all new residents and faculty on the signs, risks and methods of counteracting fatigue. Each Program Director is also responsible for having a yearly in -service to educate residents and faculty on the signs, risks and methods of c ounteracting fatigue. 2. Program Directors and faculty are responsible for adopting policies and procedures to prevent, monitor and counteract the effects of fatigue and for encouraging residents to use fatigue mitigation processes to manage the potential ne gative effects of fatigue. Each residency program must ensure the continuity of patient care in the event that a resident cannot engage in patient care due to fatigue. Residents are responsible with transitioning their clinical responsibilities to another Resident or to an attending physician if he/she is too fatigued. 3. Program leadership is responsible for ensuring that a resident has an alternative means of transportation home if he/she is too fatigued to safely return home. In such cases, residents should : a. first, seek alternative transportation from colleagues, program faculty, or program administration; and b. if this option is not feasible, the resident should take a taxi or ride service, and provide the receipt for his/her trip home to program leadership . The resident will subsequently be reimbursed for the taxi or ride service expense. C. Reporting Fall -Outs in Work Hours 1. Program Directors have primary responsible for monitoring Work Hours to ensure adherence to the ACGME Institutional, Common Program and S pecialty/Subspecialty Requirements. The method of monitoring must be approved by the GME office and residents are required to follow their residency program's method of Work Hour reporting (e.g., reporting Work Hours timely and accurately in MedHub). 2. The GMEC, through the GME office, further monitors Work Hours. Residency programs are required to investigate Work Hour compliance issues or concerns identified by or reported to the residency 37 program by the GME office or by the GMEC. Residency programs wi th a history of non -compliance incidents may be placed on monitoring and/or be subject to a Special or Internal Review in accordance with the procedures in the Special Review and Internal Review Protocol and Policy Graduate Medical Education Programs policy. 3. Tulane University School of Medicine encourages reports of any concerns related to Work Hours and all Work Hour fall -outs and is committed to timely addressing areas of non -compliance. Residents and faculty are responsible with reporting events that vi olate residency program Work Hour policies and this Policy. Residents and faculty should report Work Hour concerns through one of the following mechanisms: a. Direct reporting to attending physicians, Program Directors, Chief residents, departmental Chairs, the GMEC, the GME office or DIO; and/or b. The University's Professionalism Reporting Platform https://medicine.tulane.edu/education/professionalismenvironment -learning-program. V.

Referenc es In accordance with Section IV.H. of the ACGME Institutional Requirements , the Sponsoring Institution must have a policy for vacation and leaves of absence, which, among other requirements, provides residents/fellows (collectively, \"residents\") with a minimum of six (6) weeks of approved medical, parental, and caregiver leave(s) of absence for qualifying reasons that are consistent with applicable laws, at least once during a resident's ACGME -accredited program, starting with the day the resident is required to report. A Sponsoring Institution's vacation and leave of absence pol icy must additionally ensure that each of its ACGME -accredited programs provides its residents with accurate information regarding the impact of an extended leave of absence upon the criteria for satisfactory completion of the residency program and upon a resident's eligibility to participate in examinations by the relevant certifying board(s) and include the additional components set forth in Section IV.H of the Institutional Requirements effective July 1, 2022, as set forth herein. II. Policy A. Program R equirements There may be circumstances in which a resident is unable to attend work for situations such as fatigue, illness, family emergencies and parental leave. Several forms of leave may be available to a resident, including a general leave of absence ; military le ave; jury duty; sick leave; medical, parental or caregiver leave; bereavement leave and vacations. Each residency program is responsible for providing an appropriate length of absence for residents requiring leave or otherwise unable to perform their patient care responsibilities and for maintaining policies and procedures to ensure coverage of patient care, consistent with this Policy. Residents must be able to implement these policies without fear of negative consequences. Each program must comply with this Policy and applicable ACGME Common Program and Program -Specific requirements in implementation of leaves of absence. B. Leave Time Prolonging Training Leaves of absence may affect a resident's eligibility for promotion, ability to complete training within expected time frames or eligibility for board examinations. The aggregate amount of leave time a resident may take without the need for additional time in training is determined by the Program Director considering program and specialty board requirements but may not exceed the maximum time away from training permitted by a program's specialty board or specialty board rules. Program Directors are responsible for providing a resident requesting or taking an extended leave of absence (or a leave of an unkno wn duration) with accurate information regarding the impact of the leave upon the criteria for satisfactorily completing the program, including the potential need to extend training, if applicable, as well on the resident's eligibility to participate in ce rtifying board examinations. C. Requesting Leaves of Absence ; Failure to Return A resident's Program Director is responsible for reviewing a resident's request for a leave of absence. To submit a leave of absence request, a written request shall be submitted by the resident seeking the leave of absence to the resident's Program Coordinator or Program Director, in accordance with program policy or procedures , and shall include : the reason for the requested 49 leave of absence, dates for the requested leave, expected return date and such additional information as required or requested by the Program Director. The Program Director shall provide a timely response to the resident seeking leave. Family and Medical Leave (FMLA), medical, caregiver and parental leave and military leave should be coordinated through the Office of Graduate Medical Education . As stated in Section C of this Policy, u pon request for a leave of absence, the Program Director must provide the resident with accurate information regarding the impact of the proposed leave of absence, both for completing the residency program and with respect to the resident's eligibility to participate in specialty board examinations. The number of total months required to complete program requirements for graduation is determined by the Program Directo r and the residency program's Clinical Competency Committee , in accordance with program and specialty board requirements . Residents failing to timely return from an approved leave of absence without obtaining a written, approved extension of the leave, may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal from their program . D. Vacation All programs must provide residents with a minimum of three (3) weeks of vacation and no more than four (4) weeks of vacation per academic year. Vacation time does not carryover from one academic year to the next. E. Sick, Personal and Wellness Days Residents are permitted two (2) weeks of paid sick, personal, and wellness leave during each academic year (collectively \"sick leave\") . Sick leave in excess of two (2) weeks may be taken from the resident's vacation time for the academic year. Residents may use sick leave to attend to their personal well-being and health; for medical, dental, and mental health appointments; to attend t o a resident dependent 's healthcare needs, or the healthcare needs of an ill or elderly family member or partner , where the resident 's presence is needed. If a resident needs to attend a medical, dental, or mental health appointment during training hours a nd the resident has exhausted their sick leave for the academic year, the Program Director will be responsible for working with the resident to determine how to best allow the impacted resident to attend to their appointment(s). Residents are asked to prov ide advance notice of the need for sick days if the circumstances allow . Residents are advised that that their specialty or residency program may have a requirement on the maximum length of time the resident can be away from their training program without necessitating additional training to complete residency. Absences beyond that designated time each academic year , including vacation or sick leave, may extend the resident's time in training. Unused sick leave is not carried over to the next academic year and is forfeited at the end of the academic year. 50 F. Medical, Parental, and Caregiver Leaves of Absence (Maternity and Paternity Leave) Paid Leave Effective July 1, 2022, six (6) weeks of paid medical, parental, and caregiver leave shall be available to residents for qualifying reasons consistent with applicable laws, on a one -time basis starting the day the resident is required to report to their pr ogram. The six (6) weeks of paid medical, parental, or caregiver leave shall be approved in advance, paid at 100% percent of the resident's salary, and may be taken at any time during a resident's program. Approved leave may be taken as a continuous leave or divided into shorter leave periods, over the course of the program, not to exceed six weeks of paid approved, medical, parental or caregiver leave. A resident taking paid medical, parental or caregiver leave shall use any vacation and sick leave available to the resident for the applicable academic year in excess of one week, as t he first sources of funding for the medical, parental or caregiver leave. One (1) week of paid sick or vacation leave shall be reserved for use outside the six (6) weeks of paid leave during the academic/appointment year that a resident takes a paid medical, parental or caregiver leave . Health and disability insurance benefits for residents and their eligible dependents shall continue on the same terms and conditions during a ny approved, paid medical, parental, or caregiver leave of absence, as if the resident were not on leave. Once the initial six (6) weeks of paid leave has been exhausted, subsequent periods of medical, parental or caregiver leave(s) shall be unpaid unless the resident has unused sick or vacation time available to apply to the medical, parental or caregiver leave. Unused vacation leave is not carried over to the next academic year and is forfeited at the end of the academic year. Unpaid Leave Unpaid medical, parental or caregiver leave may be available under the FMLA to a resident who has exhausted their 6 weeks of paid parental, medical or caregiver leave or for whom paid parental, medical or caregiver leave is not otherwise availa ble. Unpaid leave may also be available to extend the total period of qualifying leave for a resident first taking paid leave. Additional information is available from the Tulane University Office of Human Resources and Institutional Equity. Group health insurance c overage during FMLA leave will be available to the resident and eligible dependents on the same terms and conditions as if the resident had not taken leave. Scope of Leave Parental leave is available to a resident for the birth and care of a child, including birth via surrogate, the adoption of a child or placement of a child with the resident for foster care. Parental leave applies to biologic, adoptive , and domestic -partner parents. Leave is also available for the care of an immediate family member with a serious h ealth condition or the trainee's own serious health condition. Requesting Parental, Medical or Caregiver Leave To the extent reasonably possible and practical to do so, the resident shall notify their Program Director, providing at least a least thirty (30) days' notice) of the request for medical, parental or caregiver leave and the resident's plans to return to the residency program following the leave. Duration of leave exceeding th e period of time allowed by a program's specialty board or 51 program for a leave of absence without additional training, will extend t he resident's time in training. G. Bereavement Leave Bereavement leave will be granted for a death in the resident's or the resident's signi ficant other's immediate family . Bereavement leave is unpaid leave; however, residents are permitted to use paid remaining sick leave or vacation time for bereavement leave . Bereavement leave shall not exceed three (3) working days for a funeral that is held within a 300-mile radius of New Orleans , Louisiana and shall not exceed five (5) working days for a funeral outside this radius. For purposes of this Policy, immediate family is defined as the resident's or the reside nt's significant other's mother, father, sister, b rother, children, grandparents, and grandchildren. Bereavement l eave in excess of a resident's remaining sick le ave or vacation time is un paid, though benefits will continue for up to six (6) weeks. As wi th all forms of leave, extended leave may result in a resident needing to extend his/her/their training to complete residency or sit for a resident's specialty board examinations. The Program Director may request confirmation of the location of a funeral for purposes of approving the length of bereavement leave. H. Educational Leave It is the policy of the School of Medicine that residents are allowed to attend and participate in educational and scientific meetings that contribute to the medical edu cation of the resident. Subject to the advance, written approval of the Program Director, residents may use up to five (5) working days per academic year of educational leave for the purpose of participating in an educational or scientific meeting that contributes to the medical education of the resident. Permission for and approval of the leave must be granted in writing by the resident's P rogram Director or the Program Director's designee. This Policy does not address expenses or reimbursement of expense s as a part of education leave . Reimbursement or payment of expenses connected to an educational or scientific meeting is at the discretion of the Program D irector. I. Military Leave Eligible employees , including residents, who are members of the National Guard, Naval Militia , a reserve component of the United States military forces or any other category of persons designated in the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Act (USERRA) and who are required to undergo a nnual field or periodic weekend training, or active -duty training shall be granted military leave for such period as provided by regulation or emergency situation. T ulane University provides a \"pay differential\" to preclude loss of earnings while on a mili tary leave of absence for up to 10 days. This pay will b e the difference between the resident's regular salary and the money received from the National Guard or other reserve unit. Military leave for hours for annual field, weekend or active -duty training are in addition to the resident's regular vacation benefit. Any additional leave required by a resident to satisfy a remaining military obligation will be granted without pay or, if the resident wishes, the resident may use unused vacation time. Armory dr ills or multiple training assemblies do not qualify for short -term military leave with or without pay. If a resident enters the Armed Forces of the United States while an employee of the University, the resident will have certain re -employment rights, as r equired by USERRA , after 52 completing military service. Contact the Tulane University Office of Human Resources and Institutional Equity (attention: Bunnie Sylve ). J. Jury Duty The Sponsoring Institution encourages residents to fulfill their civic responsibil ity to serve as jurors when called. If a resident is called for jury duty, they must present the summons to the Program Director as soon as it is received. However, the School of Medicine reserves the right to request that residents be released from jury duty if an absence will negatively impact a training program's operations. Residents will receive pay during jury duty. When a resident returns to work at the conclusion of jury duty, they must provide evidence of the dates of service to their Program Director. K. Review/Oversight 1. This Policy must be available at any time in the GME Office for review by residents. 2. The GMEC shall monitor and provide oversight of ACGME-accredited programs' implementation of this Policy and requests for leaves of absence, including medical, parental, and caregiver leaves of absence, at least annually and in the aggregate. The GMEC encourages residents to raise concerns regarding the ir vacation and leave time through one of the following mechanisms: a. Direct reporting to Program Directors; b. Direct reporting to the Department Chair; c. Direct reporting to the GMEC or DIO; d. The Residency Education Committee, either directly or via the resi dent's/faculty's representative; and/or e. Tulane Resident and Fellow Congress, either directly or via the resident's representative. f. Tulane's Office of Human Resources 3. Extension of training determinations under Section F (medical, parental and caregiver leave) may be applied retroactively to all residents currently in a program, to the extent allowed by a program's applicable certifying board. 53 XII. Policy on Immunization Procedures & Occupational Hazards (Revised 8/19/2020) Residents may be at risk for developing infectious diseases from patients, and, in some cases, be at risk for infecting patients and colleagues. A. Tuberculin Testing. 1. Tulane provides PPD skin tests at the time of orientation. A routine PPD test will be placed on each resident at orientation, unless the resident has a history of prior positive tuberculin reactivity. 2. Routine annual PPD testing is required for continuation in the traini ng program. a. In May of each year, residents will receive a PPD history form from their program coordinator. b. It will be their individual responsibility to complete this form and schedule an appointment with the Tulane Living Well Clinic (988 -4325). The PPD will be placed at that time (with no charge to the resident). c. The resident should return in 48 hours to this clinic to have the PPD read. d. The result of the test should be communicated, via the signed TB form, to the program coordinator. e. Residents with a history of a positive PPD must complete the Positive PPD form, documenting treatment (if any), and assessing any signs/symptoms that would prompt radiographic evaluation. A baseline radiograph should be obtained on any resident with a positive PPD (or history of positive PPD). f. More frequent, or alternative, testing may be indicated for residents at high risk for TB exposure. B. Hepatitis B Vaccination. Any resident who has not received a series of three hepatitis B injections during medical school should have a baseline titer. Hepatitis B vaccine should be offered to any resident with a negative titer. There is evidence to suggest that titers wane after five years after the series; therefore, these individuals should also obtain a titer and a boost er injection if indicated. C. Influenza Vaccination. All residents are required to obtain an annual influenza (flu) vaccination. To ensure consistency with hospital affiliate policies, this vaccination will be provided by our hospital affiliates. Those resi dents who are vaccinated will receive a sticker for their name badge demonstrating their compliance. Those residents who refuse, or have contra -indications to vaccination, will be required to wear a mask in all clinical areas during the flu season, as defi ned by the clinical site. D. Occupational Exposures. In the event of an occupational exposure to blood or body fluids (i.e., needle -stick), the resident should follow the following procedures. Detailed instruction can also be found at https://risk.tulane.edu/ehs/programs - services/bloodborne https://risk.tulane.edu/ehs/programs -services/bloodborne - pathogens pathogens 1. Scrub the wound for 5 minutes with betadine, hibiclens, or soap. If there is a splash of blood or body fluids to the eye, then it should be irrigated for 5 minutes with water or normal saline. 2. The resident should report immediately to the Emergency Departme nt of the facility at which the exposure occurred. If there is no such Emergency Department, the resident should report to the Tulane University Hospital Emergency Department. 3. The resident should complete the Exposure Form by accessing the bloodborne pat hogens exposure page https://risk.tulane.edu/ehs/programs -services/bloodborne -pathogens and selecting the appropriate form . 54 a. This form will collect information on the event, the resident's salient medical history, and any information known about the p atient from whom the exposure occurred. b. This form should be return to workcomp@tulane.edu or fax to 504 -865-6796 4. The resident should then page the Infectious Disease resident on -call to review the information on the form and discuss treatment options. 5. The following day, the resident should schedule an appointment with the Tulane Wellness Clinic to review the incident and the recommendations. 6. In all cases, the resident should report the injury to his or her program director and the Tulane Living Well Clinic at 504-988-4325 tlwocchealth@tulane.edu 7. An occupational exposure can be psychologically devastating, as the event is often colored by fear, guilt or shame. All of these emotions frequently prevent resi dents from seeking timely help and/or counseling. Residents should not underestimate the emotion associated with an occupational exposure, and should err on the side of seeking psychological counseling following the event. Free counseling is available via the Residents' Assistance Program Director, Dr. Andrew Moroson; (504 - 322-3837) or email him at dr.morson@ibhnola.com . E. COVID-19 Exposures and Testing 1. Test-Positive Residents a. All residents testing positive for COVID -19 must report their test results to their program director and program coordinator, and must complete the University's COVID Reporting Form. (https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?TulaneUniv&layout_id=17 ) b. Residents with test-positive COVID-19 Infection. The return to work criteria (with or without symptoms at the time of the test being positive) is as follows: i. At least ten days have passed since the symptoms first appeared, AND ii. At least twenty -four hours have passed since last fever without the use of fever -reducing medications AND other symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) have improved. iii. The return to work time duration is extended to 20 days (instead of 10 days) for residents who experien ced severe to critical illness, or who are severely immunocompromised. The time and condition for return for those severely immunocompromised will be determined by the resident's physician. iv. Residents who never experienced symptoms can return to work ten days after the positive test. 2. Residents with a high -risk exposure a. A high-risk exposure is defined as contact with an individual known to be COVIDpositive for greater than 15 minutes, within six feet of the individual, and during which either the positive individual or the resident were not wearing personal protective equipment (medical or surgical masks). The individual known to be COVID -positive could be a patient, another health -care provider, or an acquaintance outside of work. b. If the high -risk exposure occurred in a clinical environment with a patient, the resident should follow the instructions below, AND notify the hospital's infection control office. The hospital's infection control office will determine if the patient contact qualifies as a high -risk exposure. c. If a resident self -identifies a high -risk exposure that is other than a clinical encounter (i.e., contact with a colleague or out -of-work exposures) the resident is to contact the Tulane Living Well clinic ( 504-988-4325 tlwocchealth@tulane.edu ) for a formal review of the exposure to ensure it meets criteria as a high -risk exposure. 55 a. Residents with a high -risk exposure who are symptomatic . The resident is to contact the Tulane Living Well clinic (504 -988-4325 tlwocchealth@tulane.edu ) for a formal review of the exposure and to arrange for immediate testing. The resident is to selfquar antine until the test results are returned . i. Residents with a positive test will follow the protocol for Test -Positive residents with symptoms (E.1.b) ii. Residents with a negative test can return to work when at least 24 hours have passed since thei r last fever without the use of fever -reducing medications AND other symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) have improved. The resident may return to all duties, but must wear a mask at all times for 14 days from the time of exposure. Higher levels of PPE for patient contact is as dictated by the clinical circumstance. iii. Residents who have non -resolving symptoms may be tested again. The resident is to contact the Tulane Living Well clinic (504 -988-4325 tlwocchealth@tulane.edu ) for a formal revie w of the symptoms to determine if a second test is warranted. e. Residents with a high -risk exposure who are not symptomatic . i. The resident may return to clinical duties, but must wear a mask at all times for 14 days from the time of exposure. Highe r levels of PPE for patient contact is as dictated by the clinical circumstance. The resident may not participate in nonclinical/non -research duties (i.e., in -person didactics) in administrative locations outside of the hospital/clinic at which they are as signed until they have obtained a negative test (see 2.e.iii below). ii. The resident must monitor symptoms (temperature and other symptoms). Residents developing symptoms will enter the pathway for \" Residents with a high-risk exposure who are symptomatic \" (E.2.d). iii. Residents who continue to be without symptoms will be tested seven days following the high-risk exposure . a. Residents with a positive test will follow the protocol for Test -Positive residents with symptoms (E.1) b. Residents with a negative test can return to all duties with standard precautions, but must wear a mask at all times for at least 14 days from the time of exposure. f. Residents with symptoms without a high -risk exposure. The resident is to contact the Tulane Wellness clinic (504 -988-4325 tlwocchealth@tulane.edu ) for a formal review of their symptoms and to determine if testing is necessary. i Residents for whom testing is deemed not necessary can return to work with standard precautions. ii Residents for whom testing is deemed necessary must self -quarantine until the test results are returned. iii Residents with a positive test will follow the protocol for Test-Positive residents with symptoms (E.1) iv Residents with a negative test can return to work with standard precautions. 3. Routine Testing of Residents. a. Per University Policies, all Tulane University employees will undergo routine testing on a mo nthly basis throughout the year. b. Residents who have tested positive will not be retested for 90 days unless they develop new symptoms. 56 c. Where applicable, residents also fall under the overall School of Medicine policy. F. Worker's Compensation 1. As employees, residents are covered under Workers' Compensation for an occupational injury. Residents should inform the treating healthcare provider that the injury is workrelated and to bill accordingly. Employees should NOT show their personal insurance as this can complicate the billing issues. You should call the Workers' Compensation Manager by phone, (504) 988 -2869 to verify benefits available. 2. Important Facts: a. Employee is entitled to medical be nefits once compensable injury occurs. b. Employee is entitled to indemnity benefits after a seven (7) day waiting period. Indemnity benefits are paid at a calculation of 66 and 2/3 percent of wages. c. All medical expenses related to a compensable injury are paid per fee schedule. d. If necessary, seek medical treatment at nearest hospital or clinic. e. Provide all medical documentation to your supervisor and Workers' Compensation Manager. f. Keep copies of documentation. 57 SECTION 3: SUPERVISION, EVALUATION & REMEDIATION OF RESIDENTS 58 XIII. Policy on Supervision of Residents Revised 4/13/2022 ____________________________________________________________________________ I. References In accordance with Section IV.J of the ACGME Institutional Requirements, the Sponsoring Institution must maintain an institutional policy regarding the supervis ion of residents and must ensure that each of its ACGME-accredited programs establishes a written, program -specific supervision policy consistent with the institutional policy and the respective ACGME Common Program and Specialty/Subspecialty Requirements. In accordance with Section III.B.4 of the ACGME Institutional Requirements, the Sponsoring Institution must oversee supervision of residents consistent with an institutional and program -specific policies and mechanisms by which residents can report inadeq uate supervision and accountability in a protected manner that is free from reprisal. II. Purpose Every physician shares in the responsibility and accountability for their efforts in the provision of patient care. This Policy on Supervision of Residents i s adopted to ensure that each residency program that is sponsored by the Tulane University School of Medicine defines, widely communicates and monitors a structured chain of supervision and accountability as it relates to the supervision of patient care. III. Definitions 1. Conditional Independence : graded, progressive responsibility for patient care with defined oversight. 2. Direct Supervision : the supervising physician is either (a) Physically Present with the resident during key portions of the patient interaction, or (b) if permitted by a residency program's applicable ACGME Review Committee and the supervision policy of the specific participating site, the supervising physician and/or patient is not Physically Present with the resident and the supervising physician is concurrently monitoring the patient care through appropriate telecommunication technology. 3. Indirect Supervision : the supervising physician is not Physically Present or providing concurrent visual or audio supervision but is immediately available to the resident for guida nce and is available to provide appropriate Direct Supervision. 4. Levels of Supervision : Direct Supervision, Indirect Supervision, or Oversight, as set forth in this Policy and the ACGME Common Program Requirements. 5. Milestones : the descriptions of performan ce levels residents are expected to demonstrate for skills, knowledge and behaviors in the six core competency domains, as set forth in the ACGME Glossary of Terms. 6. Physically Present : the teaching physician is located in the same room (or partitioned or c urtained area, if the room is subdivided to accommodate multiple patients) as the patient and/or performs a face -to-face service. 7. Oversight : the supervising physician is available to provide review of procedures/encounters with feedback provided after care is delivered. IV. Supervision of Residents A. Supervision Requirements and Progressive Authority 1. Residency Program Supervision Policies : Each residency program must develop a supervision policy for its program that is consistent with this Policy and the ACGME Common Program and 59 Specialty/Subspecialty Requirements. Each residency program must: (a) define when Physical Presence of a supervising physician is required, consistent with the program's ACGME Review Committee requirements, and (b) set guidelines for circumstances and events when residents must communicate with the supervising faculty member(s). It is the responsibility of each resident to know the scope of their authority and the circumstances under which the resident is permitted to act with Conditional Independence. 2. Supervision Responsibilities - Generally : Proper supervision of residents is expected at Tulane Medical Center and at each program participating site to ensure consistently high standards of patient care. Each patient must have an ide ntifiable and appropriately -credentialed and privileged attending physician (or licensed independent practitioner as specified by the applicable ACGME Review Committee) who is responsible and accountable for the patient's care and who is listed as the physician in charge of the patient's medical treatment in the patient's medical record. Information regarding the attending physician (or licensed independent practitioner) must be made available to residents, faculty, other members of the healthcare team and patients. When providing direct patient care, it is the responsibility of the residents and faculty to inform each patient of their respective roles in that patient's care. 3. Levels of Supervision : Each Program Director is responsible for evaluating each resident's abilities based on specific criteria, guided by the Milestones. The Program Director and faculty members must establish the appropriate Level(s) of Supervision for each resident based on the resident's level of training and abili ty, evaluations and patient complexity and acuity. The Level of Supervision for each resident must be commensurate with the resident's performance in the ACGME core competencies. Levels of Supervision should be documented in the resident's end -of-the-year summative evaluation and promotion letter, if applicable. Residents who fail to meet expected criteria should not be promoted and residents who advance in the residency program should incur progressively greater levels of responsibility. Initially, PGY -1 residents are required to be Directly Supervised. PGY -1 residents can progress to being supervised Indirectly as may be specified by their applicable ACGME Review Committee. 4. Supervision by Faculty : The overall responsibility for the treatment of each patie nt lies with the faculty (and attending physician if different) to whom the patient is assigned and who supervises the resident. Faculty supervision assignments must be of a sufficient duration to assess the knowledge and skills of each resident and to del egate the appropriate level of patient care authority and responsibility. Faculty must be involved in the care of the patient to the extent necessary to assure consistently high standards of patient care and faculty shall delegate portions of care to resid ents based on the needs of the patient and skills of each resident. The faculty member assigned to a patient is responsible for, and must be familiar with, the care provided to the patient, and is expected to fulfill this responsibility, at a minimum, in t he following manner: a. Direct the care of the patient and provide the appropriate Level of Supervision based on the nature of the patient's condition, the likelihood of major changes in the management plan, the complexity of care, the experience and judgment of the resident bein g supervised and within the scope of the approved clinical privileges of the staff practitioner; b. Document this supervision via admission, operative, procedure or progress notes, or an acceptable linking-note to the resident's documentation. The faculty me mber's involvement in the patient's care and supervision of the resident should be reflected in both the resident's note and the faculty's addendum; c. Assure that all technically complex diagnostic and therapeutic procedures which carry a significant 60 risk to the patient are: medically indicated; fully explained to and understood by the patient to meet informed consent criteria; and properly executed, correctly interpreted, and evaluated for appropriateness, effectiveness and required follow -up. Evidence of f ollowing these procedures should be documented; and d. Direct appropriate modifications of care as indicated in response to significant changes in diagnosis or patient status. Evidence of this assurance should be documented. 5. Supervision by Senior Residents : For certain aspects of patient care, the supervising physician may be a more senior resident who can serve in a supervisory role to the resident in recognition of the resident's progress towards independence. Other portions of care provided by the resident may need to be supervised by a Physically Present supervising physician or by an appropriately available supervising faculty member or senior resident, either in the institution, or by means of telecommunication technology. The privilege of progressive au thority and responsibility, Conditional Independence, and a supervisory role in patient care must be assigned by each resident's Program Director and faculty members. B. Setting-Specific Supervision Requirements 1. Supervision of Residents Performing Invasive P rocedures in the Operative Suite : The inherent risks associated with all types of surgery and invasive procedures require that faculty provide an appropriate Level of Supervision to the resident performing the procedure. a. For all invasive procedures perfor med by residents in the operating room or procedural suite, faculty must provide Direct Supervision. b. Faculty supervising residents will review the indications for the procedure and document in the patient's medical record their concurrence with the indica tion, risks and benefits, the resident's performance, the interpretation of the results and the complications, if any. c. Faculty will supervise residents performing the evaluation of patients, scheduling of cases, assignment of case priorities, the preoperat ive preparation and the intra -operative and postoperative care of surgical patients and patients undergoing invasive procedures. This supervision will be reflected in the faculty member's progress notes at appropriate times in the course of each patient's hospitalization. d. As residents advance in their education and training, the Level of Supervision provided by the faculty member may change. A greater degree of responsibility and autonomy provided to a resident during surgical/invasive procedures will depe nd upon the resident's general aptitude, demonstrated competence, prior experience with similar procedures, the complexity and degree of the risks involved in the anticipated surgical/invasive procedure. Program Directors are responsible with documenting t he assigned Level of Supervision for each resident in the resident's record. This will include the types of diagnostic or therapeutic procedures the resident may perform, the degree of autonomy afforded to the resident in performing those procedures and those procedures for which the resident may act as a teaching assistant. e. As a general rule, senior residents, when acting in the role of a supervising physician to a less experienced resident, may supervise the performance of surgical/invasive procedures of lesser or more routine complexity; however, this does not release the faculty member's responsibility to oversee the patient's care. When a resident is acting in a supervisory role to another resident, the faculty member rem ains responsible for the quality of care of the patient, providing appropriate supervision and meeting medical record documentation requirements as required by this Policy. 61 2. Supervision of Residents Performing Invasive Procedures at the Bedside : If a resid ent has demonstrated competence in an invasive procedure performed at a patient's bedside, a faculty member does not need to be Physically Present unless Physical Presence is a requirement of the program's ACGME Review Committee. However, the faculty membe r remains ultimately responsible for ensuring that the procedure is safely performed, which includes reviewing with the resident the indications for the procedure. Faculty must document in the patient's medical record their concurrence with the indication, risks and benefits, the resident's performance, the interpretation of the results and the complications, if any. a. All bedside procedures and incidental resident tasks must be Indirectly Supervised and some procedures and tasks must be Directly Supervised. The decision as to which residents are able to perform which procedures and cognitive tasks without Direct Supervision is made by the Program Director and faculty based on the resident's performance, as assessed by the Clinical Competency Committee. b. Program Directors must maintain a list of invasive bedside procedures and tasks that can be performed by program residents without Direct Supervision. i. Program Directors and faculty, with direction from the Clinical Competency Committee's assessment, will assig n to each resident which invasive bedside procedures the resident can perform without Direct faculty or senior resident supervision. This assignment is not based solely upon the resident's PGY status, but rather assigned individually based upon the resident's aptitude, demonstrated competence and prior experience with the procedure in question. ii. The Clinical Competency Committee will create an a priori criteria by which the Committee will determine which residents are competent to perform invasive bedside procedures and other tasks without Direct Supervision. This criteria will include minimum numbers of successful procedures/tasks, a review of such procedures in a procedure log, and additional criteria (i.e., simulation center training) as determined by the Clinical Competency Committee. iii. The Program Director is responsible for communicating this criteria to the GME office for review. Any changes in the criteria will require a re -review by the GMEC. iv. At the end of each semester, the Program Director will provi de an updated list of the individual residents who have been determined to perform the various procedures/resident tasks without Direct Supervision to the participating sites for that residency program and to the GME Office. C. Transitions of Care 1. Residency p rograms are required to design clinical assignments to optimize patient care transitions, including their safety, frequency and structure. In order to facilitate both continuity of care and patient safety, residency programs must ensure and monitor effecti ve, organized hand -over processes and residents must be competent in communicating with team members in the hand -over process. 2. Program Directors must educate core faculty members and residents regarding effective transitions of care. This instruction shou ld include: a. The principles and purpose of close -loop communication; b. Appropriate identification of illness severity; 62 c. Appropriate patient summaries, as defined by the patient's complexity and tenuousness; d. Appropriate action lists, as defined by the patient's complexity and tenuousness; e. The importance of in -person sign -in and sign -out of patients who will require on -going care via a colleague (i.e., a night -float resident); f. Where to locate/identify the component of the written (or electronic) sign -out form that ensures patient safety; g. The importance of timely completion of documents essential to facilitating successful t ransitions of care from one arena to the next; and h. Situational awareness and contingency planning. 3. Attending physician and resident schedules for those who are responsible for care must be maintained and communicated by residency programs and clinical sit es. Program Directors, in collaboration with the DIO, must ensure that participating sites engage residents in standardized transitions of care consistent with the setting and type of patient care. a. PGY-1 residents must be Directly Supervised in their tra nsitions of care (i.e., sign -out) by senior residents or faculty until which time the Program Director has determined that the PGY -1 resident can safely conduct transitions of care. b. Program Directors, working with site directors, must ensure that PGY -1 residents are Directly supervised in their transitions of care (i.e., sign out) until which point the Program Director is satisfied that the PGY -1 resident has demonstrated sufficient mastery of transition communications to warrant transition of care duties without Direct Supervision. D. Reporting Fall -Outs in Supervision 1. The School of Medicine, in collaboration with the GME office, recognizes that the clinical environment can be complex and dynamic on a day -to-day basis. Nonetheless, there should not be an occasion in which residents are inadequately supervised or in a position where they believe their clinical responsibilities are above their own abilities. 2. Residents and faculty are responsible, regardless of whether they were directly involved in the incident or not, to report events of inadequate supervision. Residents and faculty may report these events without fear of negative consequences or reprisal. 3. Residents and faculty should report events involving inadequate supervision via one or more of the following mechanisms: a. Direct reporting to attending physicians, Program Directors, Chief residents, departmental Chairs, the GMEC, the GME office or DIO; and/or b. The University's Professionalism Reporting Platform https://medicine.tulane.edu/education/professionalismenvironment -learning-program. V.

Misco nduct identified by the residency program or reported to the residency program may be addressed in a tiered manner as set forth herein or may result in immediate Adverse Action, depending on the conduct. 77 C. Tier One: Academic/Professional Counseling 1. Academic /Professional Counseling is often the first step a residency program should utilize, outside of modifications and adjustments to a resident's individual learning plan, to address resident clinical or professional deficiencies, such as administrative deficiencies or limited clinical deficiencies. Examples of reasons a resident may be placed on Academic/Professional Counseling include, but are not limited to poor chart precepting, failure to complete administrative duties, complaints about the resident's knowledge or communication, or isolated displays of unprofessional behavior. 2. A resident may be placed on Academic/Professional Counseling by the Program Director or their designee, on their own initiative , or on the recommendation of a faculty membe r, or the Clinical Competency Committee (CCC). Th e Program Director or designee will establish a faculty member or other advisor, counselor, or mentor for the resident (the \" Resident Advisor\") to assist the resident in add ressing the identified deficiency, conduct or concern. 3. The Resident Advisor is responsible for meeting with the resident, documenting discussions on the resident's deficiency(ies), conduct or concern, identifying goals for the counseling and identifying any specific activities required of the resident to address the deficiency, conduct or concern (\"Memorandum of Record \" or \"MOR\"). The resident shall acknowledg e receipt of the MOR in writing. 4. The Program Director or the Program's Director des ignee shall inform the resident that Academic/Professional Counseling is the first step in the School of Medicine's disciplinary and intervention process and that if Academic/Professional Counseling does not resolve the matter, that the resident may be sub ject to disciplinary action or further interventions, including Remediation, Probation , or an Adverse Action. 5. The Program Director is responsible for determining if a resident has satisfied the elements of the MOR , with input from the Resident Advisor reg arding the resident's efforts. A copy of the MOR and the resident's progress as related to the MOR will be maintained by the residency program in the resident's record. D. Tier Two: Remediation 1. If a Program Director, or the CCC in consultation with the Program Director , determines that a resident is not meeting applicable academic standards , including professionalism standards, based on evaluations or feedback, and either has completed Academic/Professional Counseling (Tier 1) or requires stronger or mul tiple interventions to satisfy academic or professional standards, the resident may be placed on Remediation. Remediation is handled by the resident's Program Director or Associate Program Director designee, in coordination with the CCC . 2. Examples of reasons to place a resident on Remediation include but are not limited to : failure to successfully complete the actions or activities in a MOR/Tier 1 counseling, continued underperformance or deficiencies , a substandard score or \" remediation recommended\" o n a single clinical rotation, the CCC recommends Remediation or an unacceptably poor in- service training exam score as set by each residency program. 78 3. A resident placed on Remediation will be notified in writing and informed of their right to address and submit a grievance to the CCC to contest the decision. Residents shall acknowledge receipt of the notification of Remediation in writing. Remediation, unless connected to an Adverse Action (e.g., Non -Promotion), does not serve as grounds for a hearing in accordance with the Grievance and Fair Hearing Procedure section of this Policy. The CCC will review a grievance submitted by a resident pertaining to the Remediation decision and may meet with the resident regarding the Remediation and Academic Excellenc e Plan, as described below. The final decision placing a resident on Remediation remains with the Program Director . 4. A resident on Remediation will receive a plan that outlines the terms, goals, and timeframe of the Remedi ation (\"Academic Excellence Plan \"). Academic Excellence Plans are developed for the resident by the resident's Program Director or designee, with input from the CCC , and are intended to help the resident improve their performance and end their Remediation. 5. An Academic Excellence Plan will have the following components : a. a description of the deficiency(ies). Resident deficiencies may relate to one or more of the following areas of perfor mance: medical knowledge; time management and and motivation; inter-personal and team skills; professionalism; or procedural or operational skills. b. written feedback from the Program Director on the resident's deficiencies. c. a timeline for the Plan not to exceed sixty (60) - ninety (90) days; however, the Academic Excellence Plan may be renewed. d. performance requirements that the resident must satisfy to end Remediation without further escalation, absent any reoccurrence or new or related deficiencies. Performance requirements must be achievable within the timeline provided. e. Consequences for failing to successfully complete these performance requirements. 6. The Plan will include planned efforts by Program leadership or the faculty to help the resident improve. While the resident is ultimately accountable for im provement, the residency program and the residency program leaders are responsible for helping the resident improve. 7. The resident's performance against the Academic Excellence Plan sh all be documented. The resident should have at least one evaluation on their progress at the halfway point on the Academic Excellence Plan. If the resident successfully completes t he requirements in the Plan, the resident will be removed from Remediation. If the Program Director and CCC determine that the resident has failed to satisfactorily complete a Plan and/or improve performance, the resident may be: a. placed on an extension of the Academic Excellence Plan, 79 b. placed on Probation, c. asked to either repeat a period of the training, extend training , or d. be subject to Non -Renewal, Non -Promotion , Dismissal or other actions. If the resident's training is exte nded, the extension may not exceed six (6) months. If the resident is subject to Non -Renewal, Non -Promotion or Dismissal or if an extension has the effect or may have the effect of Non -Promotion or Non -Renewal, the resident will be provided a written notic e of intent of Non -Renewal, Non -Promotion or Dismissal, as applicable, as set forth in Section F. In addition, the resident will be provided a copy of this Policy and asked to sign acknowledgement of receipt. 8. Documentation regarding the resident's Remedi ation will be maintained by the residency program in the resident's record. E. Tier Three : Probation 1. Probation is designed to address academic deficits, including, but not limited to, deficits in medical knowledge, time management, organizational abili ties, communication skills, procedural skills or professionalism. Probation may also be used to help address profess ional deficits, including issues of Misconduct. Probation decisions may involve consulting with the DIO and institutional resources, as necessary. 2. Examples of reasons to place a resident on Probation include, but are not limited to : failure to successfull y complete an Academic Excellence Plan, a substandard score or \"repeat rotation\" on a clinical rotation, a recommendation of the CCC after review of resident performance, Misconduct, ongoing professionalism, behavioral or performance issues, and ongoing lo w or substandard in -training exam scores as determined by each residency program. 3. Placing a resident on Probation is a decision that is made by the resident's Program Director after the CCC provides input on the resident evaluations and performance with respect to issues of competency or academic/professional performance . Academic/Professional Counseling and/or Remediation may, but need not, precede a determination to place a Resident on Probation. Except in extenuating circumstances (which may include Misconduct) , Probation should not be invoked for an isolated incident, including isolated underperformance on in -service examinations . A pattern of deficienc ies should generally be documented in the res ident's file . 4. Residents on Probation will receive a plan that outlines the terms, goals and timeframe of the Probation (the \" Corrective Action Plan \" or \"CAP\"). 5. The resident will be notified of their Probationary status in writing and the resident must acknowledge his/her/their receip t of the notification in writing . 6. The resident will be given an opportunity to address and submit a grievance to the CCC and Program D irector to contest Probation or the terms of the CAP. The CCC will review a 80 grievance submitted by a resident and may mee t with the resident regarding the Probation and CAP. The CCC has final authority on whether to uphold the Probation. 7. CAPs are developed for the resident by the resident's P rogram Director with input from the CCC. CAP s must be approved by the DIO . 8. The purpose of a CAP is to help the resident improve their performance and end their Probation. The CAP will have the following components : a. a description of the deficiency (ies). Resident deficiencies may relate to one or more of the following areas of perform ance: medical knowledge; time management and organization; clinical reasoning; and motivation; inter-personal and team skills; professionalism; or procedural or operational skills. b. documentation regarding the resident's deficiencies c. written feedback from the Program Director on the resident's deficiencies . d. a timeline for the Probation not to exceed ninety (90) days ; however, the CAP may be renewed. e. performance requirements that the resident must satisfy to end Probation without further escalation, a bsent any reoccurrence or new or related deficiencies. Performance requirements must be achievable within the timeline provided . f. consequences for failing to successfully complete these performance requirements. 9. A CAP will include planned efforts by the Program D irector or the faculty to help the resident improve. While the resident is ultimately accountable for im provement, the residency program and the Pr ogram Director are responsible for helping the resident to improve. 10. The resident's performance against the CAP should be documented. The resident should have at least one evaluation on their progress at the halfway point on the Probation timeline. 11. If the resident successfully com pletes the requirements in the CAP , the resident will be removed from Probation . 12. If the Program Director and CCC determine that the resident has failed to satisfactorily complete the CAP and/or improve performance, the residen t may be: a. asked to either repeat a period of the training, extend training , extend probation, or b. be subject to Non -Renewal, Non -Promotion, Dismissal or other action. 13. If the resident's training is extended, the extension may not exceed six (6) months. If the resident is subject to Non -Renewal, Non -Promotion or Dismissal or if an extension has the 81 effect or may have the effect of Non -Promotion or Non-Renewal, the resident will be provided a written notice of intent of Non -Renewal, Non -Promotion or Dismissal, as applicable, as set forth in Section F. In addition, the resident will be provided a copy of this Policy and asked to sign acknowledgement of receipt. 14. Documentation rega rding the resident's Probation will remain a part of the resident's file. F. Tier Four : Non-Renewal, Non -Promotion, D elayed Graduation, D ismissal and Suspension (Adverse Actions) 1. Non-Renewal: In the absence of extenuating circumstances, the resident's Program Director should make the decision not to renew the resident's contract no later than four (4) months prior to the start of the resident's next contract year or year of training; however, Non - Renewal within four (4) months of the end of a contract year remains an option . a. If a resident's contract will not be renewed, the resident must be given written notice of intent not to renew the resident's contact with notice on the opportunity to appeal this decision to the Program Director . The resident shall acknowledge receipt of the notice of intent in writing. If upon appeal, the Program Director upholds the decision not to renew the resident's contract, the resident has a right to request reconsideration of the decision and review by the Grievance and Fair Hearing Committee in compliance with the Grievance and Fair Hearing Procedure section of this Policy. 2. Non-Promotion : The decision not to promote a resident to the next post graduate year of training is based upon a resident's competency as demonstrated through evaluations and achievement of applicable Milestones in compliance with the Policy on Evaluation and Promotion , and rests with the residency program's Program Director . a. If a resident will not be Promoted, the resident must be given written notice of intent. The resident shall acknowledge receipt of the notice in writing. The resident must be given an opportunity to appeal the decision to the Program Director and CCC . If upon appeal, the Program Di rector upholds the Non -Promotion decision , the resident has a right to request reconsideration of the decision and review by the Grievance and Fair Hearing Committee in compliance with the Grievance and Fair Hearing Procedure section of this Policy. 3. Delayed Graduation : a. As is the case of Non -Promotion, if the Program Director determines, based on information from the CCC, that a resident requires extended time in training in order for the resident to satisfy residency program requirements, the resident will be given w ritten notice of intent and the resident shall acknowledge receipt of this intent in writing. The resident will be given an opportun ity to appeal the decision to the CCC and the Program Director. If upon appeal, t he Program Director upholds the decision to extend training, the resident has a right to request reconsideration of the decision and review by the Grievance and Fair Hearing Committee in compliance with the Grievance and Fair Hearing Procedure section of this Policy. 82 4. Dismissal : a. Dismissal of a resident can arise, but is not limited to, the following circumstances: i.

Abandonment of patient care or training demonstrated by a failure to show to training or work for a series of days without notice o r request for leave, pending appropriate consideration of any extenuating circumstances; iii. Failure to participate in, or successfully complete, a CAP; and/or iv. Failure to maintain the requirements of employment, as outlined in the resident contract. b. The decision to dismiss a resident should be initiated by and be made by the resident's Program Director in consultation with the Tulane University Office of General Counsel, the Office of Human Resources and Institutional Equity and the DIO. c. In all cases, the resident will be informed of their Dismissal by written notice of intent to Dismiss, which should be acknowledged, when possible, in writing. d. The resident has a right to appeal the decision and request review by the Grievance and Fair Hearing Committee in compliance with the Grievance and Fair Hearing Procedure section of this Policy. The resident will have ten (10) calendar days after being informed of the resident's Dismissal to file a Grievance. If a resident is Dismissed, the resident's contract shall terminate as of the effective date of Dismissal (following the completion of any due process procedures). 5. Suspension : A resident may be Suspended by the resident's Program Director or the DIO if they believe Suspension is necessary. A resident who is Suspended shall receive written notice of the Suspension as soon as reasonably possible following any verbal notice provided to the resident. A Suspended resident may appeal the decision and request review by the Grievance and Fair Hearing Committee in compliance with the Grievance and Fair Hearing Procedure section of this Policy . A Resident may be Suspended from a residency program pending appeal of a Dismissal. G. Administrative Referrals and Interim Leave 1. If a resident is engaged in Misconduct or Unprofessional Behavior or if a resident's clinical performance is assessed by a GME Administrator to require prompt review, the matter may be referre d to the DIO, to allow for an evaluation. S uch referral s are referenced herein as the \"Administrative Referral Pathway.\" 2. At the discretion of the DIO, the resident may be placed on interim leave (an \"Interim 83 Leave\"). Pay and benefits will continue during Interim Leave . An Interim Leave is not disciplinary in nature, but is designed to provide the DIO with sufficient time to investigate the referral. 3. To make a referral of a matter using the Administrative Referral Pathway, a GME Administrator must submit a written request to the DIO . Alternatively, the DIO may directly initiate the Administrative Referral process. 4. Upon receiving or initiating the request, the DIO, with the assistance of Tulane University Office of Human Resources and Institutional Equity or other resources as appropria te, will conduct an evaluation or investigation of the resident or the incident leading to the referral , which review or investigation may include, but is not limited to: a review of the resident's file, review of police or incidents reports (if applicable ), interviews with the resident, interviews with faculty or other members of the School of Medicine or interviews of individuals at participating sites. 5. After completing the review , the DIO will render one of the following decisions: a. The resident requir es no corrective action and will be reinstated. The referring GME Administrator will be informed of the reinstatement. b. The resident requires Remediation without Probation. The resident will be reinstated and the DIO will work with the resident's Program D irector to design an appropriate Academic Excellence Plan . The GME Administrator who made the referral will be informed that the resident will be working through a n Academic Excellence Plan . c. The resident is considered by the DIO to require Probation, in which case the resident's Interim Leave will be lifted, but that matter will be referred by the DIO to the resident's Program Director and CCC to allow for further review of whether Probation is appropriate. The Program Director, in collaboration with the program's CCC, will review the applicable circumstances, including inciting events if any, and the resident's performance evaluations. If the Program Director and CCC determine that the resident does not require Probation, the resident will be reinstated, either with no further action required, or a n Academic Excellence Plan without Probation. If either the CCC or the Program Director determines that Probation is appropriate, the Probation section of this Policy will be followed. d. The resident remains on Interim Leave and is referred to The Resident's Assistance Program by the DIO in accordance with the Resident Wellness and Residents' Assistance Program policy. After the resident has been referred, Administrative Personnel should not communicate with the resident or the Residents' Assistance Program regarding the resident or his/her impairment . i. The Residents' Assistance Program is generally intended for residents who require behavioral health services, and/or for the identification and treatment of residents with psychiatric, substance abuse or other impairment. If the resident refuses to be eval uated by The Residents' Assistance Program for fitness for duty or further referral, the resident may be Dismissed. The resident has a right to 84 appeal this decision and may request review by the Grievance and Fair Hearing Committee in compliance with the G rievance and Fair Hearing Procedure section of this Policy. ii. Upon completion of an evaluation, the Residents' Assistance Program Director will communicate the results of the evaluation to the DIO, who will in turn, notify the resident's Program Director. e. The resident is Dismissed. H. Grievance and Fair Hearing Procedure 1. A resident may submit a grievance with respect to a Remediation or Probation decision in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section D (Remediation) and Section E (Probation), re spectively. A resident with a concern related to the resident's educational experience, including a concern regarding a program's curriculum, rotations or a learning and working environment, may communicate the concern or issue in person or by email to eit her their Program Director or to the GME Office to avoid a conflict of interest. If an issue or concern is reported by a resident to the resident's Program Director, the Program Director shall work directly with the resident to resolve the issue or concern . If an issue or concern is reported by a resident to the GME Office, a GME Office representative or a graduate medical education leader will work with the resident to resolve the issue, which may include elevating the issue or concern to the DIO or refer ring the matter to appropriate Tulane University offices or resources to address the issue or concern. Perceived inappropriate treatment of a learner, or of any member of the learning environment, may be reported via the School of Medicine's Environment o f Learning platform. https://medicine.tulane.edu/student -affairs/professionalismenvironment -learning-program. 2.

In the event that the seriousness of the crime is beyond the scope of parole powers, a call will be place to the University's Attorney -at-Law, or a designee. This office will then provide legal counsel to that person as to his/her rights or to an appropriate bail agency unless that individual chooses to obtain other counsel which is his/her option. 4. The Crime Prevention Coordinator will then notify the respective section head, such as the Asso ciate Dean for Graduate Medical Education, the chair of the department, or the program director. A report of what has occurred will be provided with as much information as possible. 5. Should the individual arrested be in need of transportation from the jail or parish prison, the Crime Prevention Coordinator will arrange for transportation to either the health sciences center or his/her residence. 6. Once the individual is returned to his/her residence, a confidential report will be compiled and forward ed to the appropriate section head. 7.

References In accordance with Sections IV.I.3 and IV.I.5 of the ACGME Institutional Requirements, the Sponsoring Institution must have policies, not necessarily GME -specific (i) covering sexual and other forms of harassment, that allows residents access to processes to raise and resolve complaints in a safe and non -punitive environment and in a timely manner, consistent with applicable laws and regulations, and (ii) prohibiting di scrimination in employment and in the learning and working environment, consistent with all applicable laws and regulations. II. Policy Tulane University School of Medicine (the \"School of Medicine\") is committed to creating and maintaining an environmen t in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity. School of Medicine residents, fellows, faculty, administration and staff have the right to train and work in an environment free from unlawful harassment, including sexual harassment, and di scrimination.

The School of Medicine follows Tulane's policies and procedures on discrimination and sexual and other forms of harassment and has procedures to raise and resolve complai nts in a safe, non -punitive manner. Policies governing Equal Employment and Educational Opportunities, Anti -Discrimination, Prohibited Conduct, prohibited Retaliation and additional policies are available from Tulane's Office of Human Resources & Institut ional Equity.

Policy on Social Media and Out -Of-Work Conduct Reviewed May 2022 A. General Principles This policy is based upon the following fundamental principles. 1. Patient confidentiality is of primary importance, as outlined in The Health Information Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA] . 2. Tulane University, as a Uni versity, values the importance of free speech and open discourse. As such, the University, being respectful of free speech and expression of ideas, does not prohibit residents from engaging in social media and/or voicing opinion outside of the workplace. 3. Maintaining respect for colleagues and co -workers is requisite for establishing a professional environment in the workplace , thereby ensuring optimal team -based patient care. 4. Enrollment in a Tulane University residency or fellowship program bestow s upon the resident the reputation and prestige of Tulane University. In exchange, it is the responsibility of each resident to uphold and protect the reputation of Tulane University. B. Policy on Social, Electronic and Print Media: 1. Patients a. Any and all depictions or descriptions of patients must comply with The Health Information Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA] . Personal health information is defined by HIPAA as any information about an individual in oral or recorded form, where the i nformation identifies an individual or for which there is a reasonable basis to believe it can be used to identify the individual. b. At no time shall patient information be shared without the signed consent of the patient. The University does not govern the content, format, or process for obtaining this consent; Tulane residents must strictly adhere to the policies and procedures of the respective hospital, clinic or healthcare system in which the patient received care. c. These guidelines apply even if the individual patient is the only person who may be able to identify him or herself on the basis of the posted description. Anonymous descriptions must not contain information that will enable any person, including people wh o have access to other sources of information about a patient, to identify the individuals described. This encompasses all emails and text messages sent from personal phones. d. At no time shall patients, or patient stories, be depicted in a disparaging, demeaning, or insulting manner. Even if patients are not identified (by name, record number, image), or even if consent has been obtained from the patient, any description of patient care should be professional and respectful of the patient. 2. Description of the Patient Care/Work Environment a. All descriptions of the workplace environment shall respect the privacy rights of colleagues and co - workers. Individuals shall not be identified by name, or be described in such a fashion that their identity is easily apparent, without explicit consent of that individual. b. The tone and content of all conversations, social media and otherwise, shall remain professional and respectful of all healthcare and University colleagues. Posting demeaning or insultin g comments or images about colleagues and co -workers to third parties is unprofessional behavior, and a violation of the Tulane University GME Policy on Harassment (Chapter XIX). 96 c. While the University does not prohibit describing disagreements on issues and with people in the workplace, residents are strongly cautioned to no t express these disagreements in social, electronic and print media for the following reasons: i. The description of the disagreement is likely to be one -sided, without the \"other si de\" having the opportunity to present their side of the agreement. ii. Readership of the described disagreement is likely to take the description out of context. iii. The description on social, electronic, or print media is unlikely to result in a meaningful solution/resolution of the disagreement. 3. Description of Self and/or Self Opinions a. The resident retains the right to express their individuality via pictures, opinions and posts on social, electronic and print media . i. All posted opinions and images, however, are to be professional; unprofessional state ments evoking, but not limited to, racism, sexism, and discriminatory statements will not be allowed, and are grounds for review by the program's clinical c ompetency committee with respect to the professionalism core competency. ii. Residents are advised to be cognizant of the image being portrayed, particularly with respect to posted images and photographs, and how that image would be viewed as being consistent with the professional physician. Employers, patients, and administrators can search and view all information posted in any forum. Enacting privacy settings does not necessarily mean that information will not end up in a public format. b. In engagin g in social, electronic, or print media communications, residents are reminded of the following: i. The resident has full responsibility for the content of individual online postings (for example: blogs, social networking sites and other digital media). ii. The permanency of published material on the Web. Most electronic media becomes cached. This means that even if the information is subsequently \"taken down,\" it likely still endures as accessible to the rest of the world on the Internet. iii. The importance of y our individual safety when posting personal materials, such as phone/pager numbers or daily schedules online . C. Association with, and Naming of , Tulane University: 1. In expressing opinions via external communications, residents should exercise caution in identifying themselves as Tulane University employees; comments made by an individual are easily ascribed to the opinion/position of the University as a whole. If the resident does disclose their association with Tulane University, the communication should explicitly note that the opinion/position expressed within the communication is solely the position of the resident, and not of Tulane University or the respective healthcare institution (i.e., hospital, clinic or healthcare system) in which they work. 2. If there is any question as to how an external communication will be received, residents are encouraged to consult with the Tulane University and/or respective hosp ital's Office of Public Relations. The Graduate Medical Education Office, and the resident's Program Director can also provide advice in reference to external communications. 97 D. Offering Medical Advice: 1. Residents are not restricted from voicing opinions on medical topics via electronic or print media. Residents are advised, however, to exercise caution in such statements and to utilize the following guidelines in making these statements: a. Residents sho uld not misrepresent their qualifications. b. The discussion or opinion should be evidenced -based where possible. c. The discussion or opinion should be generic to the topic, and not designed to diagnose or treat an individual patient via electronic means. d. Advice should not be offered; where the discussion or opinion could be interpreted as offering advice, the comm unication should include a disclaimer that the reader should consult with a physician prior to making any decision. 2. Residents are reminded that the terms of their employment with Tulane University limits the provision of medical advice within the cont ext of the teaching environment, where appropriate supervision exists; malpractice insurance may not extend to medical advice outside of the teaching environment. E. Outside-of-Work Conduct 1. It is expected that residents behave professionally in and out of work, as behavior in both settings exemplifies the development of the professionalism competency, and reflects upon Tulane University reputation. 2. Tulane University respects the privacy of all of its residents. Tulane does not prospectively monit or residents' outside -of-work activities. 3. All professionals have a collective professional duty to assure appropriate behavior, particularly as it pertains to professional behavior 4. Unprofessional behavior outside of work may be investigated if it is b rought to the attention of the program director and/or DIO and may be integrated into the Clinical Competency Committee's assessment of the resident's professionalism core competency. F. The University's Role in Monitoring and Enforcement 1. Tulane University will not monitor residents' social, electronic or print communications without cause to do so. Tulane University assumes no liability or responsibility for resident's social, electronic or print communications of which it is not aware. 2. All professionals have a collective professional duty to assure appropriate behavior, particularly in matters of privacy and confidentiality. It is the responsibility of each University employee to self -monitor this policy and report violations to the respecti ve program director and/or DIO. 3. Tulane University reserves the right to inspect a resident's social and/or electronic media for cause, as defined by a report of a violation of this policy. 4. Tulane University reserves the right to monitor a resident 's social and/or electronic media for cause, as defined by a previous violation of this policy. 5. Penalties a. If a social, electronic, or print media posts/communication is deemed to be inappropriate by the program director or the clinical competency c ommittee, the resident will be asked to redact or take 98 down the communication. The resident has a right to appeal this decision to the DIO, who shall have the final decision regarding redacting or taking down the communication b. The clinical competency committee is entitled to integrate violations of this policy into their decisions regarding probation, suspension, non -renewal and termination (Chapter X X), particularly with respect to the core competency. c. Residents in violation of this po licy may also be subject to discipline from the respective hospital, clinic or healthcare network. Residents in violation of this policy may also be subject to p rosecution or a lawsuit for damages for a contravention of HIPAA. G. Electronic Communication with Residents 1. Afferent communication: a. The GME Office recognizes importance of communicating to residents about events, opportunities, and additional information necessary for clinical care. b. However, the GME Office also recognizes that exces sive electronic communication to residents can lead to \"alert\" fatigue. c. Further, the GME Office also recognizes the potential for abuse in sending electronic communications to the residents that are inappropriate. 2. Efferent communication: a. The GME Office recognizes the value of obtaining information from residents via surveys. b. However, the GME Office also recognizes that excessive communication leads to \"survey fatigue.\" In such a scenario (i.e., excessive surveys), there is a risk that residents' compliance with essential surveys (such as the ACGME annual survey) will diminish. c. Further, the GME Office also recognizes that the residents' opinions are the intellectual property of the residents, and residents should not be compelled to express those opinions unless they are essential to the viability of the training programs a nd the clinical operations in which our residents participate. 3. The GME Office will operate a resident, program director and program coordinator list -serve. All three list-serves will be centrally monitored in the GME Office. a. The list-serve address will only be released to the respective recipients, and entities or individuals approved by the GME Office. b. Only afferent communications that are within the above guidelines will be allowed to be distributed to the residents. c. Communications rega rding industry or pharmaceuticals will not be authorized, as per the guidelines in the Vendor Policy. d. Entities or individuals who repeatedly violate the above guidelines regarding appropriate messaging will be excluded from further use of the list -serve. 4. All surveys distributed to the residents must first be approved by the GME Office. Residents will be instructed to disregard any survey that has not been previously approved by the GME Office. 99 5. Residents' email addresses will not be shared with any individual outside of the University unless there is, in the judgment of the DIO, direct reason, consistent with the training and clinical care environment, to do so. 100 SECTION 4: INSTITUTIONAL POLICIES & ORGANIZATIONS 101 XXI.

The CCC is responsible for identifying any resident whose perform ance warrants remediation , probation, 108 non-renewal or termination. C. Raise and Resolve Committee 1. The Tulane University Graduate Medical Education office recognizes that all individuals involved with graduate medical education have a responsibility to ensure a work environment that is conducive to optimal education and patient care. Stud ents, residents, faculty, and staff are all encouraged to raise and resolve any and all issues that might potentially compromise the educational and clinical care environment. While the majority of these issues can and should be resolved via formal or info rmal interactions with the faculty and program leadership, some misunderstandings, disagreements or complaints might still persist. The following procedure is to resolve residency -related issues that cannot be resolved through the program's leadership. 2. Issues Addressed a. Issues shall not be limited, but should generally involve matters that compromise, or have the potential to compromise , the graduate medical education educational and patient care environment. b. The Raise and Resolve Committee will not hear issues related to probation, suspension or termination. These will be addressed according to the GME Policies and Procedures, Chapter XV. Policy on Remediation, Suspension, Termination and Grievance. 3. To the extent possible, students, residents, faculty, and staff are encouraged to exhaust all means of resolving the matter within regular channels of reporting in their respective role. a. Students are encouraged to bring issues first to one or more of t he following: their supervising faculty, the clerkship director, the respective program director, the respective program's Residency Education Committee, the Office of Medical Education, the Chair of the Department, the Designated Institutional Official, o r the University Professionalism Committee. b. Residents are encouraged to bring issues first to one or more of the following: their supervising faculty, their program director, the program's Residency Education Committee, the Chair of the Department, the Associate Dean of GME (DIO), the Assistant Dean of GME, or the The University's Professionalism Reporting Platform. https://medicine.tulane.edu/education/professionalismenvironment -learning- program c. Faculty are encouraged to bring issues first to one or more of the following: their program director, their immediate supervisor (Section Chief or Chair), hospital administration, the program's Residency Education Committee, the Chair of the Department, the Associate Dean of GME (DIO), the Assistant Dean of GME, or the The University's Professionalism Rep orting Platform. https://medicine.tulane.edu/education/professionalismenvironment -learning-program d. Staff are encouraged to bring issues first to one or more of the following: their immediate supervisor, the hospital/clinic site director, hospital administration, the program's program director, the program's Residency Education Committee, the Chair of th e Department, the Associate Dean of GME (DIO), the Assistant Dean of GME, or the The University's Professionalism Reporting Platform. https://medicine.tulane.edu/education/professionalismenvironment -learning-program 4. If the matter is not, or cannot, be resolved through these channels, the student, resident, faculty or staff may approach one of the members of the Raise and Resolve Committee Chair to address the issue , 5. The Raise and Resolve Committee shall be comprised of the following: a. Three faculty, at least one of which must be a program director. All three shall be from different departments . b. Two residents , both from different programs. 6. The Raise and Resolve Committee shall function as follows : a. The Raise and Resolve Committee Chair, who has received the concern via the institution's reporting platform or directly from an individual, will either: i. Attempt to manage the issue directly with the program in question, if it can be effectively done so , or 109 ii. Notify the other members of the Raise and Resolve Committee. Those members who are from the program in question will be recused from participating in the subsequent discussion and mediation. b. The Raise and Resolve Committee will hear from the individual bringing the concern, either in person or via the concern , as well as from leadership from the program in question. c. The Raise and Resolve Committee will endeavor to mediate a compromise suitable to both parties. d. If The Raise and Resolve Committee cannot find a successful resolution of the issue, the matter shall be referred to the GMEC for consideration. The GMEC will then be responsible for ensuring the final resolution of the matter. D. Annual Reports . Each program is required to provide an annual report at the end of each academic year. The report is due by July 30th of each academic year , and should be posted to the program's wiki page. The goal of the annual report is to identify areas of improvemen t in the training program. The GME Office recognizes that program directors and coordinators are busy, and additional bureaucratic work detracts from time that could be devoted to the residents and the residency program. As such, the Annual Report is divid ed into three sections: Section 1 is Data the GME Office will pull directly from WebAds, (thereby relieving program directors from repetitive work); Section 2 is data that the Program Director/Coordinator is responsible for providing on an annual basis . Section 3 is endurable materials that should be on file with the GME Office, and updated as needed 1. Section 1: Data the GME Office will pull directly from WebAds a.

Special Review and Internal Review Protocol and Policy Revised 7/6/2022 I. References In accordance with Section I.B.6 of the ACGME Institutional Requirements, the Graduate Medical Education Committee (GMEC) must demonstrate effective oversight of underperforming residency and fellowship program (s) sponsored by Tulane University School of Medicine (the \" Sponsoring Institution \") to ensure compliance with ACGME and Tulane GME requirements. The Special Review process must include a protoc ol that: (1) establishes a variety of criteria for identifying underperformance; and, (2) results in a timely report that describes the quality improvement goals, the corrective actions, and the process for GMEC monitoring of outcomes, including timeline s. II. Scope This policy applies to all Tulane -sponsored ACGME -accredited residency and fellowship programs. III. Purpose The ultimate goals of Special Reviews are to improve the quality of Tulane School of Medicine's (\"Sponsoring Institution\") training programs an d reduce the number of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) citations received by its programs. Special Reviews are conducted by an ad hoc team based on review of various program performance metrics monitored by the GMEC, its subcom mittees, and/or the GME Office. The Special Review process is designed to: 1) critically assess and identify areas of improvement for the educational and clinical training experience provided to residents and fellows, 2) improve program compliance with ACGME r equirements, 3) guide programs in making corrective actions where necessary, and 4) advocate for learners and programs within the broader Tulane School of Medicine environment. IV. Policy A. Criteria for Special Review Programs may be identified as underperforming according to a variety of criteria, including but not limited to those listed below: 112 EXTERNAL CRITERIA INTERNAL CRITERIA ACGME Letter of Notification indicating: a. Initial Accreditation with Warning b. Continued Accreditation with Warning c. Probationary Accreditation d. or any other adverse ACGME accreditation status as described by ACGME policies Review of the Annual Program Evaluation (APE) indicated that a Special Review is recommended. Inquiry from ACGME Office of Resident Affairs. A pattern of Clinical and Educational work hours non-compliance identified by the GMEC. Annual ACGME Resident Survey identifying program mean less than 4.0 for the work hour domain. Concerns communicated by the GME Office indicating substantive non -compliance with ACGME requirements and/or institutional policy. Annual ACGME Residents and/or Faculty Survey program means that fall below 3.0 in three or more domains, excluding those domains in which 50% of programs have less than 3.0 (60%) Improvement in prog rams with a means lower than 3.0 will be considered. Annual Program Evaluation and improvement plans that fail to satisfactorily address required elements, such as current citations, areas for improvement, and/or issues raised from prior Special Reviews. Down trending performance from Annual ACGME Resident or Faculty Surveys in 3 or more domains (or below 80%) indicating concerns in the clinical learning environment excluding Work Hours. Request from the Designated Institutional Official. Request from the Program director, departmental chair, or dean of the medical school. As per majority vote of the GMEC for all other circumstances. B. Process If a program is identified as underperforming, the GMEC will approve a special review of the pro gram, after which the program will be notified in a timely manner of the quality improvement goals and corrective actions recommended for the program, and the process by which GMEC will monitor the program's outcomes, including timelines [Institutional Req uirement I.B.6.a).(2)] . Special Reviews will be managed through the GME Office. Special Review team members will participate on an ad hoc basis to ensure that no conflict of interest exists between the individuals and the program under review. The Specia l Review process will include group interviews with peer -selected residents/fellows representing each training level in the program, teaching/core faculty, program leadership (e.g., program director, program administrator, others as indicated), and departm ental leadership. 113 C. Procedure 1. The GMEC will approve programs for a Special Review . 2. The GME Office will alert the program of the Special Review and will schedule meetings with program constituents. 3. Documentation reviewed during the Special Review will vary based on areas of underperformance identified for the program, and may include: a. Accreditation Data System (ADS) Program Information and Annual Updates. b. Accreditation Letters of Notification (LON) from recent ACGME reviews and progress reports sent to the respective review committee, if applicable. c. Previous Annual Program Evaluations (APEs), including improvement plans. d. Recent ACGME Resident/Fellow and Faculty Survey results. e. Compliance with ACGME requirements, and f. Other materials considered relevant as determined by the Special Review Committee, including metrics developed and tra cked by the GME Office (e.g., scorecard, program trends, etc.) 4. The Special Review Committee may identify additional areas of underperformance through review of supplemental documentation and program interviews. 5. The Special Review Committee will identify q uality improvement goals and corrective actions recommended for the program, and the process for GMEC monitoring of outcomes in a written, timely report to the GMEC for approval. After approval, the report will be shared with the program, which will share the report with residents/fellows and faculty with scheduled progress reports to GMEC on a pre - determined timeline. 6. The GMEC will monitor progress towards program improvement goals and determine when corrective actions have resolved areas of underperforma nce or require escalation. D. Special Review Committee Each Special Review of a residency or fellowship Program will be conducted by an ad hoc committee appointed by the GMEC (a \" Special Review Committee \"). No member of a Special Review Committee may be selected from the Residency Program under review or from within the Residency Program's department. Each Special Review Committee shall include, at a minimum: 1) The DIO or his or her appointed designee or in the event of a conflict of interest, the Assistant DIO. 2) At least one faculty member or program director from the GMEC, a Program Director who is not a member of the GMEC, or a member of the Accreditation Subcommittee. 3) At least one Resident as nominated, selected, and approved by the Tulane Reside nt and Fellow Congress: and 4) The GME Manager of GME Systems, Program Support & Training . The DIO, his or her appointed designee, or the Assistant DIO, as applicable, shall serve as the Chair of a Residency Program Special Review Committee. E. Confidentialit y of Special Review Documents 114 The Special Program Review is a peer -review activity conducted by the Graduate Medical Education Committee. Each Special Program Review Committee member will be required to sign a statement of confidentiality. SPECIAL REVIEW PROTOCOL: PROCESS, MONITORING, AND TIMELINE 1. Based on various program performance metrics monitored by the GMEC committee, the underperformance program (s) may be identified by GMEC Accreditation Subcommittee based on Special review criteria and other metri cs. Recommendations from the DIO, Department Chair, or others may also be considered. 2.
