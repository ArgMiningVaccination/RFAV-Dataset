In the absence of this evidence, an enrollment hold will be applied and the student will be unable to enroll in subsequent semesters. - Measles, Mumps & Rubella (MMR): All newly enrolled students born on or after January 1, 1957, must show proof of two vaccinations for MMR. History of the disease is not sufficient for compliance unless accompanied by a positive quantitative blood titer. A student may choose to sign a waiver* indicating that they: 1) Have a medical condition that precludes them from getting the vaccine; 2) Are pregnant; Or, 3) Have religious reasons for not having the required vaccinations. - Meningitis: All newly enrolled students living in university-owned group housing are required to be vaccinated with the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine which protects against A, C, Y and W-135 types of meningitis or sign a waiver* indicating that they decline vaccination. If the student received this vaccination more than five years prior to beginning attendance at KU, it will be necessary for the student to receive a booster dose. We recommend the student receive this booster prior to attending Orientation. The meningitis B vaccine does not fulfill this requirement but is also recommended. For more information about Meningitis or the vaccine, please refer to [Meningitis](/meningitis). *Before a waiver is granted, the student must meet with the WHS Medical Director. Please call [785-864-9533](tel:+1-785-864-9533) to request the waiver form and to schedule the appointment to meet with the Medical Director. Accepted Forms Students may submit their immunization history using our [Immunization History Form](/sites/studenthealth/files/documents/ImmandHHF.pdf) which must be completed by a medical provider. We also accept immunization records from an official source such as a physician's office or a school transcript that contains this information. All immunization forms or records submitted must include the student's full name and date of birth. Questions about other acceptable proof of immunizations may be directed to Watkins Immunization Compliance Coordinator at [785-864-9533](tel:+1-785-864-9533). How To Submit Immunization Records Students are to submit immunization records through our secure [patient portal](https://watkinspatientportal.ku.edu) accessible seventy-two (72) hours after enrollment on a mobile phone, tablet or desktop computer: - Login using your KU online ID and password.
