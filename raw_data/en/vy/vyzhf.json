Since they have undergone very little milling or processing, they are among the most nutritious of all wheat products. Wheat berries are firm and slightly chewy, and can be a delicious part of breakfast, lunch, or dinner. You can mix them with veggies and herbs for a savory salad, or mix them with fruit for a sweet treat. Look for them in the \"health food\" section of your grocery store, or at a health food store.
