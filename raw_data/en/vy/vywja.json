We are London, Ontario's first certified naturopathic clinic to provide safe and sterile compounding for IVIT. B12 and Folic Acid Injections Common nutrient deficiencies of B12 and folic acid are often found in vegetarians and vegans who are not supplementing properly, the elderly and those with digestive disorders such as Crohn's & Colitis patients. B12 is especially important for the function of our nervous system and energy levels. This therapy is a single intramuscular injection of a solution rich in B12 and folic acid aimed at reestablishing proper functioning levels. We use only the active \"Methyl\" forms of the vitamins to ensure full absorption & utilization by the body. Cost $28.00 and can be covered by most extended health care plans. Intravenous Vitamin & Minerals Intravenous administration is an effective way to administer minerals, vitamins and antioxidants. Oral vitamin-minerals may not work for certain people due to the limitation of intestinal absorption and cellular transport systems. Through the use of intravenous medicine absorption can be increased dramatically and act as a supportive therapy for increasing energy, alleviating symptoms of chronic fatigue & fibromyalgia, anti-aging and speeding up recovery from illness. IV therapies are often used as a supportive medicine during chemotherapy and radiation treatments. "}
