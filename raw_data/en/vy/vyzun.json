In fact, more adults suffer from this than any other back injury. And the pain is excruciating. The intervertebral disc consists of soft gelatine-like nucleus that is held in place by a fibrous ring of connective tissue. If it tears, the soft central portion can bulge out, a process referred to as a spinal disc herniation. Surgery is usually unavoidable if the condition brings on muscle paralysis or the presence of cauda equina syndrome, of which incontinence is a symptom. DR. HANS CLUSMANN [translation]: \"A small number of patients truly need surgery. This is typically the case if the conservative treatment doesn't have a lasting improvement or if there is either muscle paralysis or a neurological disorder such as cauda equina.\" NARRATOR: The body automatically tries to minimize spinal disc bulges on its own and, today, conservative treatment methods can highly accelerate the process and make surgery unnecessary. A great number of doctors trained in Europe and the Americas have wholeheartedly embraced acupuncture, a conservative treatment with roots in Southeast Asia. Placed properly, the needles alleviate pain enabling patients to move about freely. DR. GREGOR GODDE [translation]: \"The needles inhibit pain locally at the point of entry. At the same time, acupuncture is a form of traditional Chinese medicine that tries to return the body's two vital-energy forces to their natural state of balance that illness disrupts.\" NARRATOR: Using images generated during a CAT scan, doctors can identify the source of the trouble. They can then inject drugs such as cortisone designed to reduce infection and pain. Under a doctor's supervision, reconstructive and rehabilitative physical training can alleviate pain in the long term. Such training begins and ends with physical activity. ANETT H\u00d6RSTER [translation]: \"A great deal of patients stop taking care of their bodies as soon as the pain subsides. They start performing the exercises again as soon as the symptoms return. But by then, it's often too late. You have to be consistent. If we can take a few minutes everyday to brush our teeth, why can't we take some time for our backs.\" NARRATOR: Healthy stomach and back muscles also help strengthen the spine. It follows that a lack of exercise is the main cause of spinal disc herniations. And, herniation or not, the sooner you start to take care of your body, the better off your back will be. DR.
