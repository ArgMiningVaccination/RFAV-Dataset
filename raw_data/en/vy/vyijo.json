Enrolled s tudents are informed of the importance of IPE by the Dean in the Introduction section within the SOP Student Handbook as he states, \"The professional curriculum is designed to challenge you and to teach you to become an independent learnter and to work in collaborative interprofessional healthcare teams \" (Appendix 11B ). Likewise, information on the SOP website for students interested in pursuing pharmacy clearly states \" pharmacists work in concert with the patient and other health care providers to promote health and prevent diseases \" (https://www.ndsu.edu/pharmacy/pharmd/ ). The SOP developed and continuously seeks college -level and external partnerships for IPE and interprofessiona l practice (I PP) for students, faculty, pharmacy residents, and other licensed health professions. The SOP has collaborations with NDSU Nursing, Public Health, Nutrition, Social and Allied Sciences to provide didactic, simulated and co -curricular IPE experiences. The SOP dev eloped a collaboration with the University of North Dakota (UND) School of Medicine and Health Sciences (SMHS) to provide IPE opportunities with medical students. In spring 2019, the SOP was one of the partners in the UND SMHS application for the funded HRSA grant , Dakota Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program, promoting IPE and IPP for the healthcare workforce in geriatrics in ND and SD (Appendix 11C ). The College promotes a variety of co-curricular opportunities for IP interaction among professional students such as IP E Grand Rounds, College Ambassadors, Dean's Liasion Council, and provides a common lounge for students enrolled in all of its health professions programs. The shared lounge creates an IP atmosphere for interact ions and relationship development . The Aldevron Tower with mixed informal seating located throughout the building will further the interactions among CHP pre-professional and professional students. The SOP experiential program includes hundreds of practice sites that were developed with health system administrators and practicing pharmacists, primarily but not exclusively in ND and M N, to provide IP team experiences. These sites provide high quality IPE opportunities for pharmacy students and affiliated pharmacy practice faculty. Major health systems providing IPE and training include the Veterans Affairs Health System (VAHS) in Fargo , Sanford Health in Fargo and Bismarck, Essentia Health in Fargo, A ltru in Grand Forks, Family HealthCare in Fargo , and hospitals and clinics in Minnesota such as the VAHS in Minneapolis , CentraCare St. Cloud Hospital in Saint Cloud and Lake Region HealthCare (LRH) in Fergus Falls . In 2017-2018, the DPP developed new posi tions and relationships with the VAHS, Sanford Imagenetics program, Essentia Health, and an additional position with Family HealthCare, expanding opportunities for faculty and student involvement in advanced IPP opportunities for diverse patient population s. PharmD IPE Program Structure , Outcome Mapping and Curricular Component Integration The SOP IPE program includes didactic, laboratory, experiential, and co -curricular components including patient care simulations using summative and formative instructional approach/assessment (Appendix 4 11D). The IPE program is structured to introduce components of IP and team education early in the curriculum . Activities/components are mapped to Interprofessional Education Collabor ative (IPEC) Collaboration) are the primary outcomes but other supportive ABOs (ABO 3.6 Communication, ABO 4.2 Leadership, 4.4 Professionalism) that provide a strong foundation for skills and abilities of team collaboration and dynamics when a second health profession is present are mapped as well. During P1 -P3 years, activities and assessment for ABOs 3.6, 4.2 , and 4.4 along with specific IP collaboration competencies (3.4.1, 3.4.2 and 3.4.3) are integrated into the didactic, laboratory , IPPE curriculum, and co - curriculum, to support IP team collaboration dynamics culminat ing with APPEs. Throughout the P1 -P2 years, pharmacy students, alongside other health professions, learn about, from, and with each other prepar ing for effective practice collaboration to provide safe and effective patient care and improve patient outcomes. Once students understand other professions, develop good communication , interpersonal, clinical, and teamwork skills, they apply and further reinforce these skills during complex high -fidelity patient simulations with nursing and medical students during P3 year , and culminate in APPEs while practicing alongside other health professions and/or students as members of IP collaborative practice team s. P1 Year Principles of IPE and IPEC competencies are introduced to P1 students in PHRM 350 Introduction to Pharmacy Practice and are reinforced during P1 -P2 years in IP E Grand Rounds and a new ly established co- curricular program that matches UND first -year medical with NDSU first -year pharmacy student s. IPE Grand Rounds are a series of co -curricular IP presentations offered each semester to all students within the College. Each 50 -min session cover s at least one IPEC competency and consists of a 35 -minute presentation by a health professional, a 10 -min IP active learning exercise and discussion, and a 5-min assessment via Qualtrics survey ( Appendix 11 F). This co-curricular activity is planned and organized by the College IPE Committee comprised of faculty from each academic unit. Pharmacy students choose 1 -2 of the sessions each semester during P1 -P2 years as a required co-curriculum element . During the summer in PHRM 355 Institutional Practice IPPE I , P1 students identify at least one non - pharmacy member of the healthcare team to interview and/or shadow to gain an understanding of role and responsibilities . Afterwards, s tudents use guided questions to complete a reflective assessment on their IPE experiences which is then reviewed by the IPPE Director . In Summer 2019, a new IP PE Heal thcare Professional/Student and Patient Interaction tool was laun ched to better track interactions and IPE activities during IPPE I and IPPE II (see Standard 12). P2 Year P2 students complete CHP 400 IP Health Care Practice a 3 credit course along side nursing, allied health, social work, and dietetics students. Weekly asynchronous pre-recorded lectures are complemented with in-class role -play, small group discussion, case -based learning with standardized patient colleagues, and simulated team-based pra ctice experience using trained volunteers to represent patients and family 5 members (Appendix 11G ). During the summer, P2 students interact with other members of the healthcare team during PHRM 455 Community Practice IPPE II, respond to a drug information r equest from a provider , and use guided questions to complete a reflective assessment on their IPE experiences (Appendix 11H ). P3 Year P3 students participate in an online IP opioid simulation in the PHRM 5 60 Special Topics (Appendix 11I ) and complete an IP high -fidelity simulation with nursing students ( Appendix 11J ). The SOP public health poster presentation day organized by the Department of Pharmacy Practice (DPP) as part of PHRM 540 Public Health class are open to all professions in the College and provides additional IP opportunity. In the co-curriculum, P3 students p articipate alongside second -year medical students in an emergency medicine-focused, high -fidelity clinical simulation at the UND Simulation Center in Grand Forks , an activity initiated in 2018 ( Appendix 11K ). P4 Year During the participate in General Medicine/Acute Care rotations expos ing them to IPP. A large number of ambulatory care, community pharmacy , institutional, and elective APPEs offer IPP and team-based practice. As of 2014, select pharmacy and medical students are paired on rural APPE in the Interprofessional Student Community -based Learning Experiences program with UND . Students identify a share d patient and each works up the patient in their scope of practice . When completed , students discuss findings together, identify gaps in care , and provide r ecommendations to providers on site if applicable. A short phone debrief facilitated by UND clinical faculty and the SOP APPE Director is conducted with the students. Annually less than 10 P4 pharmacy students participate in this , however future expansion is planned. During P4 year, all students complete and log a minimum of 10 IPE activities in E*Value (e.g. patient care rounds with prescribers, interactions with student prescribers, multidisciplinary education, and providing medication information to members of the healthcare team) that are evaluated/reviewed by the APPE Director and SOP Experiential Education Committee. A large proportion of these logged activities are with physicians or nurse practitioners. See Standard 13 for more information. Postgraduate As part of postgraduate education, the DPP has two co -joined PGY-1 pharmacy residency programs and supports three residents . Residents are incorporated into hospital and clinic IP teams . Interprofessional activities include IP team rounding, student -led \"Falls Team\" visits to patient's homes with a public health nurse, presentation of the \"Falls Cases\" to the preceptors of the IP team (including PharmD, RN, PT, OT, and geriatric NP ), psychiatric medication review via an IP team of providers (e.g. nurses, PT /OT, and social workers ), and opioid stewardship team of physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and social worker s. Assessment and Continuous Improvement of the IPE Program Directors of APPE and IPPE ensure that high quality experiential IPE/IPP opportunities are included in introductory and advanced experiences. They work with the SOP Curriculum Committee that recommended inclusion of new IPE activities to IPPEs (e.g. health profession shadowing). The Director for Experiential Outreach an d Assessment provides information to preceptors regarding IPE/IPP during 6 preceptor development presentations and ensures they are informed that all IPE assignments listed in experiential course syllabi are required and that IPE/IPP experiences are strongly encouraged through any IPPE and A PPE rotation . New pharmacy faculty joining CHP 400 continue to improve course activities, mapping, and assessment. The biggest deficiency in our IPE program is th e need for refining of the processes and responsibi lities for comprehensive , hands -on oversight of the IPE program including assessment, especially related to didactic, simulat ed and co -curricular activites. Assessment techniques for IP team dynamics and team-readiness range from formative feedback , discussion , debriefings to summative assessment via standardized rubric s, quizzes, reflection papers, and team -based cases ( Appendix 11D ). Outcome summative data of IP team -readiness is provided in Append ix 11L incorporating summative outcomes for 3 consecutive academic years from IP activities supporting ABO domain 3.4. There is progression of IP team readiness from P1 through P4 ye ars and increase d provision of patient care as team members of IP teams . Appendix 11 M provides a comprehensive 3 -year assessment of stu dents' IP team dynamics outcomes for each pharmacy year. Appendix 11N reports summative assessment data for 2018 -2019 and demonstrates integration and sequencing of individual ABOs linked to individual IPEC competencies and overall programmatic outcome data for IPEC competencies. Data demonstrate good horizontal and vertica l integration of team dynamics from ABO 3.6 (Communication) , 4.1 (Leadership) , and 4.4 (Profesionalism) and IP team dynamics from ABO 3.4 domain (IP Col laboration) throughout the PharmD curriculum. Program -level outcome data demonstrate IP team readiness and s tudents' outcome data competency in IP team dynamics (Appendix 11L -N). AACP Survey Data The program scored above the national average for questions 3 , 15 and 38 from the graduating class on AACP surveys from 3 consecutive academic years from 2016-2019. An a verage score of 94.6% indicated students agreed/ strongly agreed that learning experiences with other professional students helped them better understand how to be part of a multidisciplinary team vs a 91.0% national average. All students (100.0%) strongly agreed /agreed that pharmacy practice experiences allowed them to collaborate with other health care professionals vs a national average of 98.0%. Importantly, 99.2% students agreed/strongly agreed that the PharmD program prepared them to engage as a member of an IP healthcare team vs a national average of 96.1%. These results reflect opportunities in our curriculum and exposure to IP team practice during pharmacy practice experiences for all graduating students. The number of preceptors who strongly agree d/agree d that PharmD program prepares students to engage as a member of an IP healthcare team increased from 2016-2018 (93.7% vs 97.7%) , at or above national average scores (Appendix 11L ). In summary, our IPE program is continually improving in the area of IP experiences, including experiences with prescribers, and assessment , and program-level outcome data demonstrate IP team readiness and students' outcome data competency in IP team dynamics. Notable New curricular act ivities with UND medical students and providers were incorporated during 2018 -2019 to ensure compliance with the standard addressing interactions with prescribers as follows: 7 1) UND/NDSU pre-simulation and simulation day. The pre -simulation day was added after the inaugural 2018 UND/NDSU simulation to increase interaction among team members, provide opportunities to learn about each profession (i.e. education, postgraduate education, clinical responsibilities in emergency department), and discuss strategies and approaches to team work and team dynamics during simulation. 2) Pairing in ratio of 1:1 or 1:2 of a first -year medical and pharmacy students for the 4 -year duration uses face -to-face interactions, face time technology and online assignments. This ensures t hat pharmacy students learn about, with, and from each other in each term of the PharmD curriculum and interaction starts early in their professional year. This program launched on September 19, 2019 at UND School of Medicine and Health Sciences where the students met for a short educational program and reception. 4) College or School's Final Self -Evaluation: Self -assess how well the program is in compliance with the standard by putting a check in the appropriate box : Compliant Compliant with Monitoring Partially Compliant Non Compliant No factors exist that compromise current compliance; no factors exist that, if not addressed, may compromise future compliance.

Dean, NDSU College of Health Professions 4 GENERAL FAQ AN INFORMAL GUIDE: The following is a series of inform al responses to ques tions most frequently asked about rules and procedures at NDSU. For further information, please refer to the current NDSU Bulletin ( www.ndsu.edu/bulletin/ ), your adviser, Administrative O ffice in Sudro 123, the Office of Registration & Records in Ceres 110, or One Stop in the Memorial Union. ACADEMIC ADVISERS Who is my adviser? Students in the pre-pharmacy and professional pharmacy progra m are assigned an adviser. It is important to m eet with your adviser on a regu lar basis to receive updated curricular information. Advisers help student s learn how to complete the registration procedures. Students are responsible for the course and program selections which they ma ke. However, an adviser is a valuable source for acquiring in formation about the advisabilit y of student choices. (If you desire a change of adviser, please contact the Associate Dean for Student Affairs & Faculty Development, School of Pharmacy, 231-7601.) Do I need to see my adviser about my semester schedule? Yes, make an appointment with your adviser during advising week to plan your schedule of classes. Dates for advising and registration are available on the Office of Regi stration & Records web site ( www.ndsu.edu/registrar ) and \"The Spectrum,\" published twice per w eek when full semester classes are in session. CREDITS How many credits do I need to be a Sophomore, a Junior and a Se nior? You need 27 credits to be classified as a Sophomore, 60 credits to be classified as a Junior, and 90 credits to be classified as a Senior. To graduate, you must successfully complete all g eneral education requirements, the requirements in your major, and with a minimum of 2.0 grade poi nt average. A complete list of University requirements for grad uation is in the current NDSU B ulletin. What is the limit on the number of credits I can take per semes ter? Full-time students will carry from 15 to 19 credits per Semester. Registration for more than 20 credits is not recommended. Special permission from your adviser and a grade point average of at least 3.0 are required to register for more than 20 credits. You mu st obtain a \"Petition to Enrol l in More Than 20 Credits\" form under the link, \"Over 20 Cr edits Petition,\" at www.ndsu.edu/registrar/forms . How many credits will I lose when I transfer to NDSU from anoth er school? O r d i n a r i l y y o u shouldn't lose any. However, a \"D\" grade in any course does no t transfer to the College of Health Professions. Some technical courses may not fit your degree pr ogram and in this case some extra work may be required. For eva luation of transfer credit see cu rrent NDSU Bulletin. How many credits can I transfer from a junior or community coll ege? All college-level credits from regionally accredited institut ions transfer; however, not all may apply to the particular degree program you have selected. To obtain a baccalaureate degree yo u must complete at least 60 semester credits at a four year college or university. At leas t the last 37 of these credits must be at the junior or senior level . (See current Bulletin.) 5 How do I challenge a course? A student who is currently registered may seek credit by chall enging a course. A course challenge usua lly consists of a special com prehensive examination; however, additional types of performance may be required for some course s. A course challenge is only permitted for courses in which t he student has not received tra nsfer credit or has no previous academic record. Prior registrations are allowable if course was dropped prior to the No Record Drop deadline in a given term. Student must be registered at NDSU during the semester in which you wish to challenge a course (see current NDSU Bulletin for complete desc riptions). Procedures for pursuing a course challenge may be found at: www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/regist rar/forms/challenge.pdf Is it possible to obtain college credits by taking examinations of the College Entrance Examination Board (CLEP and AP)? Yes. Students may demonstrat e evidence of college-level achievement through the use of n ationally standardized tests. Competency to write these examinations may have been gained th rough intensive preparation in high school, extensive reading in a particular field, or other types of formal or informal pre paration. A student may not repeat by proficiency testing a course t hat has been previously taken or failed at NDSU or another accredited institution. Score reports must be sent directly to NDSU from the awarding agency/board. School reports and student-issued grade r eports are not considered off icial for purposes of awarding credit by examination. DEGREES (CURRICULUM REQUIREMENT) How do I petition for a waiver or substitution of a curriculum requirement? To petition, you must obtain a \"Request to Waive or Substitute Courses\" form under th e link, \"Substitute/Waive a Course\" at www.ndsu.edu/registrar/forms . In this petition, which is presented to the Academic Affairs Committee of the College of Health Professions, you state exact ly why you think you should have a waiver. The Committee will revi ew your petition and you will b e notified of their dec ision. (Petitions should be submitted onl y when special circum stances make it vir tually impossible for you to meet the regular degree requirements.) Only departmental and college requirements may be waived. University requirements may not be waived. GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS Who must complete the General Education Requirements? The General Education Requirements apply to all students. What are the General Education Requirements? The General Education Requirements are listed in the current NDSU Bulletin. A l ist of the courses approved f or the different categor ies is provided at www.ndsu.edu/regist rar/academics/gened. General Education transfer with the ND University System. Students who plan to transfer from one institution to another in the ND University System should c heck with Office of Registration & Records in Ceres 110 or One Stop in the Memorial Union. GRADES AND ACADEMIC STATUS What is the G.P.A.? Grade Point Average. For each credit of \"A\" you receive four (4) honor points; three (3) for each credit of \"B\"; two (2) for each credit of \"C \"; one (1) for each credit of \"D\"; and zero (0) for each credit taken in which a grade of \"F\" is received. The GPA is computed by dividing the total number of honor points earned at NDSU by the total number of cr edit hours in which honor points were recorded. For example, a person with a G.P.A. of 3.00 has a grade average of \"B.\" The minimum GPA of 2.00 is required for graduation. Developmental courses do not count toward graduation requirements. 6 If I do not do well in a course, may I take it over again? Yes. The second grade, whether higher or lower, will replace the first grade in computing the GPA. B oth grades are listed on your Permanent Record. To replace a grade for a course taken at NDSU, that course MUST be repeated at NDSU. The one exception is that NDSU students may regi ster for a Tri-College course to repeat a course previously taken at NDSU. NOTE: PROFESSIONAL COURSES IN THE PHARMACY PROGRAM - please refer to Policy #3.24, Repetition of Professional Course s, in the College Policy Manual. NOTE: PRE-PHARMACY CORE COURSES, Policy #2.21.1 - The total number of pre-pharmacy core courses which may be repeated shall be lim ited to three. The grade received during the student's final attempt for any core pre-p harmacy course will be us ed in evaluation for admission. A withdrawal is not c onsidered an attempt. A core course is one that is included in the GPA for admission purposes. CURRENT COMPETENCY, Policy #2.28 - Coursework in the areas of science and mat hematics must be no more than seven years old at the time of application to the pr ofessional program. Coursework presented in these areas t hat is older than seven years must have current competency demonstrated.

STUDENT ACADEMIC AND CONDU CT STANDARDS POLICY 3.01 (revised October 31, 2018) Introduction The mission of the NDSU College of Health Professions is to edu cate students and advance research and professional service in pharmacy , nursing, allied sciences, and public health. The College has established professionalism and ethics as two of its core values. Pharmacists, nurses, allied health care professionals, public h ealth professionals, and pharmaceutical scientists must live up to the hi gh ideals of their profession. Their lives must be guided by the principles of honesty and integrity, in order to ensure that the public can r egard their words and actions as unquestionably trustworthy. To develop an understanding of and respect for these principles of honesty and integrity as applied to the academic work of pharmacy, nursing, allied science, and public health students, the College of Health Professions has developed this student conduct policy. This pol icy is applicable to anyone enrolled as a student in the College, including those in the pre-professional , professional, and graduate programs. This policy also applies to any student taking a course for credit i n the College. Acceptance of this policy is required as a condition of admission to the College. Academic Standards The academic standards of the College of Health Professions dif fer from those of the University. Any student who fails to meet or exceed the University standards ma y be placed on University probation or suspension (see the current NDSU Bulletin for university inform ation on academic deficiencies). Semester Grade Point Average (All Students): To be in good academic standing within the College, all undergraduate and professional students shall maintain a se mester grade point average of 2.00 or above for each semester enrolled in the College of Health Profe ssions. All graduate students are expected to maintain a 3.0 grade point average as well as any o ther academic policies outlined by the graduate school. Any student who fails to attain a semester GPA of 2.0 or above may be placed on College probation. Students who have been placed on academic probation for two (2) consecutive or three (3) non- consecutive semesters shall be suspended from enrollment in the College. After two suspensions, 20 students will be terminated from the College. (Termination from the College does not prohibit the student from registering elsewhere in the University provided t he academic standards of the alternate college of registration have been met or exceeded.) A student who is suspended and desires readmission into the Col lege m u s t f i l e a r e q u e s t f o r r e - admittance with the Senior Associate Dean at least 60 days prior to the be ginning of the semester in which readmission is sought. In addition, professional students must seek readmission to the professional programs in Pharmacy, Nursing, Allied Sciences, an d Public Health through the Admissions Committee of t heir respective program. Minimum Grade Requirement (Professional Students): To be in good academic standing within the College, all students enrolled in the professional programs of the Colle ge must complete all required courses within the College with a grade of \"C\" or above. Studen ts are encouraged to refer to program- specific policies related to minimum grade requirements which c an be found in the College Policy Manual at www.ndsu.edu/healthprofessions/college_information /policy_manu al/. Graduate students are expected to uphold policies and procedures consistent with the graduate school and to maintain a 3.0 grade point average. Students Enrolled in College Aff iliated Educational Training Pr ograms (Professional Students): To be in good academic standing within the College, all student s enrolled in College affiliated internships, clinical, or experiential training programs are al so required to uphold the academic standards of that affiliate and will be subject to the terms of probation, suspension, and termination of the affiliated program. Student s failing to meet affiliated pro gram academic standards may also lead to termination from the College. Conduct Standards High standards of professional c onduct are expected from all st udents, both to facilitate the learning of all students and to promote professional values. Individuals are ex pected to represent the College, professional program, or profession in a positive, professional manner. Students conducting clinical experiences, rotations, and/or in ternships must also uphold the specific policies of their clinical site. All students are held responsible for exhibiting the following professional attributes : honesty, integrity, accountability, confidentiality, and professional demeanor. Aca demic dishonesty and professional misconduct are unacceptable. If there is doubt about whether or not academic or professional conduct is appropriate, individuals should query the Dean's Office. Examples of unprofessional conduc t include, but are not limited to, the following: Academic Misconduct: 1. Cheating, includes but is not limited to, the following: a.

Reporting Process Academic Misconduct 1. Students are required to report any academic misconduct to t he Senior Associate Dean within 7 days of the occurrence. Failure of the student to report violat ions within the required time could result in immediate expulsion from the College and/or its progr ams. Graduate students must also report to the Department Chai r of the graduate program. 2. The course instructor who suspects that academic misconduct has occurred in their course or other instructional context has an initial responsibility to: a ) inform the student(s) involved of his/her suspicion and the suspicion's grounds; b) allow a fair opportun ity for the student to respond; and c) make a fair and reasonable judgment as to whether any academic misconduct occurred. 3. The course instructor will report academic misconduct violations to their Department Chair within 7 days of the occurrence or di scovery of the misconduct. 4. The Department Chair will r eport the academic misconduct to the Senior Associate Dean . 22 Professional Misconduct 1. Students are required to report any professional misconduct to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development within 7 days of the occurrence .

A copy of the Student Academic Misconduct Tracking Form will be placed in the student's academic file. Professional Misconduct 1. Professional misconduct issues may be more likely to happen outside of the classroom and have broader implications for the well-being of students, faculty, a nd staff in the College. Hence, the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development has the initial and primary responsibility for administeri ng and enforcing professional mis conduct issues. 2. The Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Developme nt will work collaboratively with the Department Chair (and where appropriate, individual instructors ) to resolve professional misconduct issues. Department and College Related Sanctions Additional academic and/or professional disciplinary sanctions for the department/program may be assigned by the Department Chai r depending upon the circumstanc es and nature of the misconduct. The Department Administrator will not ify the student in writing of the sanction and rights to due process and forward a copy to the Senior Associate Dean &/or Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development. The Senior Associate Dean may impose additional disciplinary sa nctions for the College and will notify the student in writing and the Dean of the College of Graduate and Interdisciplinary Studies (if a graduate student involved). Disciplinary action for academic and professional misconduct will depend based upon the seriousness of the misconduct. In general, sanctions may include, but are not limited to, any of the following: 1. Probation. 2. Supervised probation. 3. Suspension from the College. 4. Termination from the College. (Termination from the College of Health Professions does not prohibit the student from registering else where in the University provid ed the academic standards of the alternate college of registrati on have been met or exceeded.) 23 In cases of particularly egregious or multiple instances of aca demic/professional misconduct, the Dean of the College may also recommend expulsion from the university. Student's Right to Appeal Students sanctioned for violations of the College Student Acade mic and Conduct Standards Policy have the right to appeal.

An appeal for any sanction must be made in writing within 15 business days of the sanction letter. The date of the letter shall be the date the letter is postmarked. If hand-delivered, a notation of that date will be made in the student's file. 5. Appeal letters must specify i n detail one or more of the fol lowing bases of appeal: a. the sanction was too severe for the offense; b. the decision for non-action/ac tion/sanction was made in an a rbitrary or capricious manner; c. the finding of the Student Academic and Conduct Standards Policy having been violated was not substantiated by evidence, and/or d. the student's/student organization's rights were violated (s pecify those rights believed to have been violated). Appeal Review Process (Pre-professional and Professional Studen ts) 1. Appeals made to the Senior Associate Dean or Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development will be reviewed by t he Academic Affairs Committee or Student Affairs Committee of the College depending upon the cond uct violation in question. 2.

Unresolved Appeals After the College appeals process has been completed, if the st udent/organization is not satisfied with the appeal decision, the student/organization has the right to appe al the decision to the Provost. The Provost will make the final dec ision on any appeals. Incomplete Disciplinary Process Students with pending disciplinary or legal actions, with sanct ions for which an appeal has been submitted but not resolved, or whose sanc tions have not been successfully fulfilled, will not be allowed to graduate from NDSU with a degree, major, or program of study offered by the College of Health Professions. In such cases, the College reserves the right to place a hold on a stud ent's graduation until the case has been successfully resolve d and the sanctions hav e been successfully fulfilled. 24 Annual Pledge, FERPA Not ification, and Signature I have read and understand the above policy. I agree to accept and abide by this Student Academic and Conduct Standards Policy of the College of Health Professions. I understand that possible violations of this policy and sanctions imposed, as well as information used to su bstantiate violations (including, but not limited to, criminal background ch ecks and drug screens), may b e shared with College affiliated educational training programs, clinical sites at which I may complete progr am-specific experiential requirements, licensing and/or certification boards relevant to my program of study, clinical sites at which I work for non- academic reasons (i.e., for pay or to volunteer), and other fac ulty, staff or administrators within the College of Health Professions and North Dakota State University who hav e a legitimate interest in my education. I understand that I have the right to revoke the College of Healt h Professions' ability to share this information at any time. Should I revoke the ability of the College of Hea lth Professions to share relevant information with the aforementioned parties, I also understand that I am im mediately ineligible to complete a degree offered within the College of Health Professions, and I volunta rily (and immediately) withdraw from my major or program of study within the College. I understand that withd rawing from a major or program of study within the College of Health Professions does not prevent me fr om pursuing another major at North Dakota State University. I am also awa re of and assume responsibility for following other College and Department policies as stated in my major or program of study's student ha ndbook. STUDENT COMPLAINT POLICY 3.28 The Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE), at the behest of the U.S. Secretary of Education, requires all accredit ed pharmacy programs to establi sh, implement and assess a formal complaint policy for students. Mor e specifically, all accredit ed colleges or schools of pharmacy must establish a comprehens ive policy with a sim ple set of procedure s whereby all students enrolled in the College (and the pharmacy program in particular) can submit and resolve a complaint about the educational process. While such procedures do not always produ ce an outcome that meets the student's preferences, they do ensure that students have access to an equitable and efficient means to remediate their complaints. The complete set of ACPE standa rds regarding student complaint policies can be found on pages 38-39 (Standar d 20) of the follo wing The NDSU College of Health Profe ssions takes student complaints very seriously. Our goal is to ensure that students have access to transparent, due process in a manner that leads to an appropriate resolution of the complaint. To that end, a copy of the NDSU C ollege of Health Professions policy relating to this issue is available on its website at www.ndsu.edu/heal thprofessions . Students who have difficulty accessing this webpage may also obtain a copy o f the complaint policy in the Dean's Office (Sudro Hall 123). A discussion of this policy shall tak e place annually during the orientation process for first profe ssional year students. Each student complaint will be appropriately documented and inv estigated. A chronological record of each complaint, including the nature of the complaint, written records of the complaint procedure and the final outcomes of the resolution process shall be maintaine d in the Office of the Dean of the School of Pharmacy, and shall be available for review by ACPE or its r epresentatives upon wr itten request or in the process of an on-si te evaluation visit. Student complaints generally fall within two major categories: complaints about unfair grading and all other, non-grade-related complain ts. Student complaints about grades are generally handled at the level of the University, since grades are usually administered through the NDSU Office of Registration and Records. Other student complaints remain under the purview of the individual colleges within NDSU. 25 Student Complaints Regarding Grades University Grade Appeal Policy 337 NDSU has an establis hed policy regarding complaints about gradi ng, otherwise known as \"grade appeals\". The full grade appeal policy, which includes hearing procedures, is available at www.ndsu.edu/fileadm in/policy/337.pdf . While students actively considering a grade appeal are referred to the aforementioned we bsite for the s pecific details of the policy, a summary of the policy is outlined below. With the exception of i ncomplete grades, a course grade is cons idered final unless an appropriate appeal is filed by the student. Gr ade changes are also consider ed only for those students who have not yet earned a degree for whic h the course in question was ap plied. For a student who has reason to believe that they have been iss ued an incorrect or inappropriate grade, he/she must initiate a request for a change of a grade w ith the instructor within fifteen (15) instructional days of the first day of the semester immediately following the semester in which the grade was awarded. For Spring Semester courses, the request may be made within fifteen (15) instructional days of the start of Fall Semester. A grade appeal is formally initi ated when the student presents the Grade Appeal Form to the instructor. If there is an unsatisfactory dec ision, the student must consul t the Department Head, and the Dean or a designated college committee, p roceeding from one level to th e next only after an unsatisfactory decision of the conflic t at that level. In the event that the i nstructor is also t he Department Head or Dean, he or she need onl y be consulted in t he capacity of instr uctor. In the event of an unsatisfactory decision within the college, the student may submit a formal wr itten appeal to the Grade Appeals Board Chair. Such an appeal shall be m ade within fifteen (15) instruc tional days after conclusion of the college proceedings a s stated above. Non-Grade Student Complaints Pre-professional and professional pharmacy students who have a non-grade-related complaint can seek resolution of t hat complaint through the following procedu res. It is important to note that these procedures represent the sole av enue for student complaints reg arding non-grade-related issues, including (but not limited to) ACPE standards, policies and pro cedures. Additionally, because the pharmacy program spans multiple departments, the non-grade comp laints are handled through the Dean's Office, rather than by the departments themselves. 1. The student(s) or, in cases where student anonymity is requ ired, their advocate (also known as the \"plaintiff(s)\") will file a formal written complaint (de livered through the postal service or NDSU email) to the Dean's Office in the NDSU College of Health Professions. 2. The written complaint must include a description of the pol icy, procedure or ACPE standard in question. It must also summarize the argument of the plaint iff (including the grounds for the appeal or complaint) and provide a reasonable amount of evi dence supporting the claim. 3. Upon receipt of the written complaint, the complaint will b e assigned to either the Senior Associate Dean (as the Chair of the College Academic Affairs Co mmittee) if the complaint is primarily academic in nature, or the Associate Dean for Student Affairs & Faculty Development (as the Chair of the College Student Affairs Commit tee) if the complaint is primarily non-academic. The plai ntiff(s) will receive email no tification (via NDSU email) within forty-eight hours of the receipt of the complaint concerning th e identity of the Associate Dean handling the complaint. 4. The Senior Associate Dean (or, if a non-academic issue, Ass ociate Dean for Student Affairs & Faculty Development) shall c onvene a meeting of College Acade mic (or, if a non-academic issue, Student) Affairs Committ ee to review the complaint. Bec ause the procedures for both Associate Deans and Committees are similar in procedure, they w ill henceforth be referred to generically as \"Associate Dean \" and \"Committee\", respectivel y. The Committee meeting shall occur within thirty days from the time that the Associate Dean receives the written complaint. 26 5. Once the Committee has met, t he Associate Dean shall prepar e and submit a formal, written reply to the student(s) based on the recommendation of Committe e. The reply shall include an evaluation of the complaint, a description of any violations , and a proposal for any necessary corrective action. The reply will be sent through off icial NDSU delivery methods (i.e., the postal service, campus mail and/or the NDSU email sy stem) within fifteen business days from the time that the Co mmittee makes a decision. 6. Decisions of the Committee t hat demonstrate arbitrary and c apricious treatment, or that are fundamentally inappropriate in the eyes of the plaintiff(s) may be appealed to the Dean of NDSU College of Health Professions. In such cases, the student (s) file an appeal using steps one through three outlined above, except the written complaint would be addressed directly to the Dean. The written complaint would also identify and pro vide evidence indicating that the Associate Dean and/or the Comm ittee acted in an arbitrary, capricious or otherwise inappropriate manner. 7. If unsatisfactory resolution occurs after the appeal to the Dean, a final appeal may be made to the Provost. Once again, the student(s) must file an appeal using steps one through three outlined above, except the written complaint would be addressed directly to the Provost, rather than the Dean, and would provide evidence substantiating the claim of unfair treatment at prior procedural levels. STUDENT TECHNICAL STANDA RDS (PHARM.D) POLICY 3.29 The North Dakota State Univers ity College of Health Professions ' mission is to educate students and advance research and professional service in pharmacy, nursing, allied sciences, and public health. As a corollary to this mission, t he Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D .) program seeks to train students who have the ability, interest and work ethic necessary to be eligi ble for licensure, and embark upon a successful career as a health care professional. Thus, the Phar m.D. professional program requires students to undertake the full set of activities that are necessary to complete their program of study. The goal of every licensed pha rmacist is to provide safe and effective care to patients. In order to provide that care, individuals mu st have the physical, cognitiv e and social skills necessary to learn, practice and master each of the competencies of one's professio n. Failure to demonstrate these competencies not only endangers the patients under the pharmaci st's care, but also impacts the ability of other providers to provide sa fe and effective patient care. Therefore, the following techni cal standards represent competen cies necessary to complete the Pharm.D. professional program and provides additional guidance to the College Student Technical Standards Policy 3.11 for students. Students must be able, with or without reasonable accommodations, to consistently demonstrate these competencies. Students who fail to demonstrate these competencies are ineligib le for admission or progression in the NDSU Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) professional program. The technical standard compete ncies are organized into five general categories: 1. Perception/observation 2. Communication 3. Motor/tactile function 4. Intellectual, conceptual, int egrative, and quantitative abil ities 5. Behavioral and Social Attributes 1. Perception/Observation Competencies Students must be able to utilize their senses and mental abilit ies to perceive and observe information presented through: Written material Audiovisual material Demonstration Large-group lectures Small group discussi ons and presentations One-on-one interactions 27 Laboratory experiences Patient encounters (at a d istance or close at hand) Procedures 2. Communication Competencies Students must be able to communi cate effectively and efficientl y (in English) using nonverbal, verbal, and writing st rategies with faculty members, other members of the healthcare team, patients, familie s, and other students, in ord er to: Produce written and or al communication Elicit information Convey information Clarify information Create rapport Work collaboratively Develop therapeut ic relationships Demonstrate com puter literacy 3. Motor/Tactile Function Competencies Students must have sufficient mot or function, skills, and tacti le ability to execute basic tasks in the training and provisi on of patient care. This inclu des coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equ ilibrium, and functional use of the senses o f touch and vision in order to: Attend and pa rticipate in classes, groups , and activities which are part of the curriculum. Conduct basic laboratory procedures and tests. Perform basic, non-sterile compounding. Demonstrate as eptic technique. Examine patients (including in spection, auscultation, palpati on, percussion, and other diagnostic maneuvers). Administer immunizations, perfo rm cardiopulmonary resuscitati on, perform palpitation, auscultation, and percussion. Provide patient care appropr iate to the circumstances. Perform in a reasonably indepen dent way in potentially high s peed/high demand/emergency en vironments. 4. Intellectual, Conceptual, Inte grative & Quantitative Compete ncies: Student must be able to demonstrat e higher-level cognitive abil ities, which include: Memory Rational thought Visual-spatial comprehension Conceptualization Application Measurement Calculation Analysis Representation (oral, written , diagrammatic, three dimensiona l) Organization Synthesis Clinical reasoning Ethical reasoning 5. Behavioral and Social Competencies Students must consistent ly demonstrate attributes of profession alism, including: Empathy, compassion, integrit y, and respect for others. Preparation, initiative, and a ccountability cons istent with a commitment to excellence. Commitment to legal and ethical principles pertaining to the provision of patient centered care. Mindfulness of the environment, recognizing that one's profes sionalism is constantly evaluated by others. 28 Reasonable Accommodations under th e Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) The College strongly encourages a ny student who suspects that h e or she may have a disability to contact the NDSU Office of Dis ability Services for guidance con cerning the steps that are necessary to document and verify the nature and extent of the disability. Consistent with NDSU and Federal policies, students with document ed evidence of disabilities may request reasonable accommodations. However, such requests are not r easonable if they disrupt, are detrimental to and/or endanger patients, students, co-workers and/ or instructors, or otherwise cause a fundamental a lteration to the program. Failing to Meet, Reporting and Ad judicating Technical Competenc ies Applicants and students of the P harmacy Doctorate professional program who consistently fail to demonstrate the competencies ident ified above are ineligible fo r admission or progression in the program. Students who are admitted to the Pharmacy Doctorate pr ofessional program and who realize (either through their own effort s or as demonstrated by a licen sing board, a preceptor or a faculty member in the program) that they do not (or no longer) consistently demonstrate the requisite technical competencies to be e ligible for licensure have an eth ical obligation to self-report that information to the College's administration (i.e., the appropri ate department chair, t he Senior Associate Dean and/or the Associate Dean for Student Affairs). Once realized (through own awareness or as reported to them by a licensing boar d, faculty, or preceptor), failure to self-report a consistent lack of technical competencies represent s a violation of the Student Co nduct Policy (College Policy Manual, Policy 3.01). SUBSTANCE MISUSE TESTING POLICY 3.14 The NDSU College of Health Professions is committed to ensuring safe, healthy learning environments, including both dida ctic and experiential learning environments, for all of its students. The use of illicit drugs, as well as the overt misuse of alcoho l and/or legally prescribed medications (including, but not l imited to, mood altering medications) comp romise learning environments and are prohibited under College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct Policy an d University Policy 155. It is beneficial for all College of Health Profe ssions stakeholders (including i ts students, faculty, staf f, clinical partners, and the patients and families we se rve) to establish a testing policy process to ensure the safety and health of these learning enviro nments, as well as to ensure an equitable due process for students who are alleged to partake i n substance misuse. Basis for Testing The College of Health Professions reserves the right to require any student enrolled in one of its pre- professional or professional programs and/or enrolled in any co urse housed within the College to undergo testing for substance mi suse. All testing is coordinate d and monitored through the Office of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development (ADSAFD). All testing must be direct observation, 10 panel (or higher) tests, and must be conducted at a WADA-accredited or SAMHSA- certified laboratory. Per Co llege Policy 3.12: Student File Con tents, all test results shall be maintained in a secure location in the Offi ce of the ADSAFD, and may be in cluded in the Student's Personal File. The default method of analysis w ill be urinalysis, although the ADSAFD reserves the right to require alternative methods of analysis ( for example, blood analysis or hair analysis) where appropriate. Alternative methods (if requi red) will be disclosed in writing when notifying the st udent about the need to be tested. Nonrandom Testing Nonrandom testing for substance misuse may occur as a requireme nt for entry into clinical sites (per site policies or program-specif ic experiential education polici es), or to fulfill the requirements of sanctions imposed und er College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct Po licy. Reasonable Suspicion Testing Incidents or events involving sus pected substance misuse by stu dents shall be reported to the ADSAFD using the Reasonable Susp icion Reporting Form. Reasonabl e suspicion shall be determined using objective evidence (photos , legal documents, or other doc umentation), reports made by credible sources (law enforcement, clin ical site staff, NDSU faculty and staff, etc.), or a combination of these sources. Because it is a violat ion of University Policy 155 and College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct 29 Policy to misuse alcohol or pre scription medications, or to use illicit drugs, and te sting may exonerate the student of an alleged policy violation should the allegatio n be made falsely, the ADSAFD may exercise discretion in determining what evidence is of sufficie nt credibility to require testing. A descriptive summary of the evidence will be provided to the stu dent at the time the student is informed of the need to submit to testing. Random Testing The College of Health Professions may implement a random substa nce misuse testing program. Should a random subst ance misuse testing pr ogram be implemented , the parameters of the program must be made freely available on the College of Health Professi on's website, and students must be provided notice of the policy at l east 6 months prior to its im plementation. No more than 5 percent of the active College of Health Pr ofessions student body may be ra ndomly selected for testing in any academic semester. No student will be randomly identified for t esting more than once in a single academic year. The random selecti on of students will be impleme nted using a computer generated random number generating process, with interval (or other non-w eighted) sampling. A summary of that selection process shall be provided to the Dean of the Col lege of Health Professions on an annual basis. Testing Process Students who are required to und ergo testing will be notified i n writing via NDSU email. Upon receiving a request for testing, students ar e responsible for providing a 10 (or larger) panel, direct observation, drug screen from a reputable, appr opriated licensed vendor with in 12 business hours of the date and time of the request. The student i dentified for testing is sole ly responsible for obtaining his/her own appointment for testing, his/her transportation to the appointm ent, and paying the costs of these tests. An original copy of the test results must be delivered to the O ffice of the ADSAFD at the end of the 12 business hour window. Test result s that show evidence of a dilu ted sample will not be accepted, and will not result in additional time in which to submit test resu lts. Ramifications for Positive Test Results or Failure to Test in a Timely Manner Students whose test results are positive are subject to sanctio ns outlined in College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct Policy. Once sanc tions are assigned, a student' s rights of due process are also outlined in College Policy 3. 01: Student Conduct Policy. Students who fail to submit an original copy of their test resu lts within the 12 business hour window face additional sanctions under C ollege Policy 3.01: Student Co nduct Policy. More specifically, students who fail to provide the r equired test results within t he 12 business hour window will be sanctioned under the pres umption that the test results for the substance misuse in question are positive. Testing Alternatives Students whose religious, cultural or other practices prohibit them from undergoing a specific type of drug test may request that the ADSAFD require an alternative te st, so long as the alternative test is of equal or greater accuracy and prec ision than the original test required by the ADSAFD. All parameters identified previously apply to t he alternative test. In the eve nt that no such test exists, or in the event that students are unable to jus tify the need for an alternative test, students may be found in violation of College Policy 3.11: S tudent Technical Standards. TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENT S FOR PHARMACY STUDENTS Students are required to purchase an iPad for use in the classr oom, Thrifty White Concept Lab, and experiential rotation sites. The Pharmacy program endorses a full size iPad that has 32 GB o r higher based upon the amount of memory, sharpness of display, a nd speed. However, students may choose any current iPad version and size, including previous iP ads (5, 6, Air or Pro) since Apple has a consistent operating system between devices so that older devices are still compatible when upgrades are made. When making your choice, keep in mind that t he iPad will be utilized for a variety of applications incl uding note taking and for testing; the iPad mini may not be an optimal choice for all formats. 30 Other devices, such as smartphon es, android tablets, and/or lap tops cannot be substituted for the iPad requirement. It is import ant to keep the technology consis tent in the learning environment so that all students have the same learning experience. Even though oth er devices can do some of the same things an iPad can do, all of t hese devices operate off differe nt platforms. Not all educational apps will work on all platforms and some devices (e.g. smart phone) are n ot appropriate for some apps (exams). Lastly, apps are designed to work on tablets, not laptops. If y ou have already purchased a device other than an Apple iPad it may be possible to sell it on Craig slist, eBay, or Amazon so that you may recoup some of your investment. We highly recommend that iPads be purchased through the NDSU Bo okstore. Exclusive arrangements have been made with the NDSU Bookstore to allow st udents the ability to charge the iPad to their student account. For students with financial aid, the charge will be subtracted from your aid. The NDSU Bookstore has know ledgeable staff including: Brad Sonmor, Dept. Manager, and Justin Hills, Certified Apple Technici an. Finally, Bookstore personnel will assist students with any service issues for all iPads purchased fr om them. Options to purchasing a less expensive iPad include buying a \"refurbished\" iPad through the online Apple store or purchasi ng one through Craigslist, eBay, or Amazon. It is recommended that students also purchase the AppleCare+ Wa rranty. The cost of the warranty is $69 - $129 for two (2) years and provides technical support and repairs, including coverage for up to two (2) incidents of accidental damage (such as dropping it) . See http://store.apple.com/us/pro duct/S4689LL/A/applecare-for-ipad for more information. (Note: If your parents purchase this device fo r you, their homeowners insuranc e may cover the iPad, minus the cost of the deductible, in the event i t is stolen. You will need to keep track of the device ID in order to report it.) The AppleCare+ Warranty c an be purchased fr om the Bookstor e. Again, the NDSU Bookstore will assist students with service i ssues if the iPad was bought from them. Students have also found that pur chasing an external keyboard i s advantageous for taking notes in class. There are several to choos e from, some of which are desc ribed in this article: https://www.digitaltrends.com /mobile/best-ipad-keyboards/ . Lastly, a word about iPad Apps. In itially, you will \"need\" only a few Apps, many which are free. At the minimum, you will need: An App to take notes in class on your iPad. The iPad comes loa ded with \"Notes\", which is basically a blank legal pad you c an take notes on. Newer versio ns of the iPad come with \"Pages\", Apple's version of Word . NDSU students can also downlo ad Microsoft Office on their iPads for FREE! Check the following for details: https://www.ndsu.edu/its/software/ software_licensing_program/mi crosoft/office_proplus/ If you want to take notes on a course handout that you've down loaded, \"iAnnotate\" is a fantastic App and wort h the $9.99. Another note taking App that is cheaper is Notability for $9.99 that is a white board applic ation for drawing, writing, a nd note-taking. \"Adobe Reader\" view PDF doc uments and also p rovides annotat ion options-FREE Some textbooks are available as downloads on t he iPad as a Kin dle, iBook, &/or Nook and you will find electronic books are cheaper than the hardcover n ew edition. Typically, the Kindle version is the most ec onomical of the three listed. You will need to install the \"Kindle\" App-FREE Blackboard - FREE - and Yuga App which is a lso FREE to be able to access these sites directly without having to go through Safari. High Point Mobile Campus Connection - FREE - https://m.cnd.ndus.edu .

Student Bl ackBoard organization in the 'iPad Apps. See the short \"How- to' Videos\" folder under Student Resources. TERMINATION - RIGHT TO TERMI NATE ENROLLMENT POLICY 3.03 The College of Health Professions reserves the right to termina te the enrollment of any student at any time, if the student demonstrates that he or she is unsuited fo r a professional career and its inherent responsibilities and obligations. Circumstances that may lead t o student termination will include, but not be limited to, violation of sta te or federal statutes or re gulations. TUITION In 2012 the North Dakota Board of Higher Education approved a d ifferential tuition for the pharmacy professional program which is higher than the standard universi ty tuition rate. Differential tuition is needed to cover the higher costs associated with a professional degree program. This differential tuition does not include other s tudent fees, room and boards, a nd miscellaneous expenses. As noted earlier, students are expected to complete certain degree requi rements including Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experience (I PPE) and Advanced Pharmacy Pract ice Experience (APPE) during summer months in addition to the regular academic year. Startin g with the fall 2013 semester, students should expect to be charged (and t o pay) differential tuition o n course credits for all professional program degree requirements regardless of the term in which cre dits are earned. The amount of differential tuition in an ac ademic term can be found on the ND SU Financial Aid and Scholarships website: www.ndsu.edu/onest op/accounts/ .There is a non-refundable admission deposit fee of $500 for students who have been accepted to the pharmacy program. T his fee is to assure their place in the class and will be applied to the differential tuition for t he first semester of the professional program. 32 NDSU ENTRY-LEVEL PHARM.

To enter the pre- pharmacy program the student must qualify for and obtain admiss ion to the University. Applications to NDSU may be obtained from t he NDSU Office of Admission. Admission to the professional phar macy program is competitive a nd limited to 85 students each year. Students are selected based upon su ccessful prior academic perf ormance at the time of admission. There are two paths to gain adm ission into the pharmacy program . New Early Admission Pathway (EAP) to the Professional Entry-Lev el Pharm.D. Program The first is our \"early admissi on\" path. This path is designed for high achieving high school students who seek an expedited path to the professional program. Student s are selected for this path based on their academic credentials (incl uding high school grade point a verages and ACT or SAT scores) at the time they apply to NDSU. Prefer ence is given to North Dakota re sidents. Supplemental applications are submitted online directly to the Pharmacy Admissions Commit tee. A nonrefundable $125.00 application fee must accompany t he supplemental application. St udents are evaluated during the summer before they enroll at NDS U as first year students, and w ill be offered admission to this path on or before May 15 of that year . Once accepted on this admissi on path, students must attend NDSU for the entire six-year program . The first year entails standa rd pre-professional studies. At the conclusion of the first year, st udents who maintain academic an d professional requirements transition into a five-year professional program. During the first year i n the professional program, students complete all remaining pre-prof essional requirements, including an expedited set of courses that prepare them for the final four years of the professional progr am. Students also complete the Pharmacy College Admissions Test (PCAT) and an on-site intervie w. Transition into the final four years of the professional program is guaranteed as long as stud ents meet all academic and professional requirements. Student s accepted into the \"early ad missions\" path, but who fail to meet all academic and professional requi rements, are encouraged to a pply to the professional program through the second path described below. Traditional Admission Pathway to the Professional Entry-Level P harm.D. Program The second path is our \"traditi onal\" path. Pre-pharmacy student s (including transfer students) typically apply for admission to the four-year professional program durin g the second (or in some cases the third) pre-pharmacy year. Admission to the professional pharma cy program is competitive and limited to the difference between the numbe r of available seats (85) an d the number of \"early admission\" students entering the final four y ears of the professional prog ram each year. Students are selected based upon successful pre-pharmacy academic performance. Prefer ence is given to North Dakota residents and students who attend NDS U. A cumulative grade poin t average of 3.0 (4.0 = A) or above is required before an applicant will be evaluated for admission to the professional program. The actual admission cutoff is much higher. The Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT) is an admission requirement. Students must take t he PCAT during the July or Sep tember testing dates. An on-site interview is part of the admission process for the professional program. Supplemental applications are due on or before December 31 for subsequent fall semester admis sion. Supplemental applications are submitted online directly to the Pharmacy Admissions Commit tee. A nonrefundable $125.00 application fee must accompany the supplemental application. Applicants should note that admission to the University does not grant admission to the Entry Level Pharm.D. Program. All students mu st apply and be formally acce pted by the Pharmacy Admission Committee of the School of Pharmacy before they may begin the professional courses in the four years of the pharmacy program. 35 Students may apply to the School of Pharmacy for admission into the Professional Pharmacy program upon satisfactory completion of t he pre-pharmacy program or evi dence that this program will be successfully completed at either NDSU or another accredited col lege prior to admission. Students not previously enrolled at NDSU must apply both to NDSU (with a NDSU Application for Admission) and to the School of Pharmacy (wi th the Supplemental Pharmacy A pplication form). Applications will be reviewed by the Pharmacy Admission Committ ee, which is composed of administrators, pharmacy practit ioners, and pharmacy faculty in the basic, administrative and clinical sciences. The size of each entering professional class is limit ed by the availability of the resources of the School of Pharmacy and the c apacity of the c linical facilit ies. NDSU is a state supported institution, thus, residents of North Dakota will be given primary considera tion. Residents from other states who attend NDSU full time will also be given partial residency pref erence. A cumulative grade point average of 3.0 (4.0=A) or above is required before an applicant will be evaluated for admission to the Professional Entry Level Pharm.D. Program. The actual admissio n \"cut off\" is generally much higher than a 3.0. Application Procedures 1. APPLICATION MATERIALS are available on PharmCAS and should b e submitted by December 31. The student is res ponsible for seeing that ALL app lication materials are submitted and received by December 31. Applications with mater ials missing will not be considered for admission. Applic ations received after December 31 may not be evaluated. Applications submitted after De cember 31 will be used to fill r emaining spots in the professional program if any are available after evaluating thos e applications submitted prior to the December 31 deadline. 2. APPLICATION FEE - All PharmCAS fees must be paid before your application will be processed. A $125.00 non-refund able application fee is required for admission. 3. If the applicant is not a current or former NDSU student, se parate application must be made for admission to NDSU through the NDSU Office of Admission. 4. Official transcripts from all universities and colleges atte nded must be sent to the NDSU Office of Admission AND to the College of Health Professions. The tra nscripts must contain the winter quarter or fall semester grades. Students must show transcr ipt evidence that all coursework required by the en d of the spring term (courses listed by name and number) will be completed by the end of spring term.

Note: NDSU students not enrolled in the pre-pharmacy major must contact the Office of Registration & Records to request their transcripts be forwarded to the School of Pharmacy. 5. The Pharmacy College Admissi on Test (PCAT) is required. Com pleted scores must be sent to the Chair of the Pharmacy Adm ission Committee. For informat ion on the PCAT, contact us at 701-231-7601. The School of Pharmacy requires that students take the PCAT in July, September, October or November 2018 as their most recent exam. We will accept PCAT scores back three years (July 2015 to November 2018). The web address for the PCAT is www.pcatweb.info . 6. All courses must be completed with at least a grade of \"C.\" Selected core courses, indicated by an asterisk (*) must be completed by the end of fall semeste r prior to the December 31 deadline date to apply to the pharmacy program. Remaining cour ses, which are required and listed in the pre-pharmacy curricu lum, MUST be completed by the end of spring term. The only exceptions are the elective s which may be completed during the summer (up to six credits). 7. An interview on campus is par t of the evaluation process for students who receive final consideration for admission. 36 Notification of Acceptance 1. Applicants are notif ied of their acceptanc e as rapidly as ad mission decisions are made. 2. Acceptance Deposit: Applicants who are offered a position i nto the entry-level Professional Pharm.D. program are required to submit a non-refundable deposi t fee of $500.00 to the School of Pharmacy to assure a p lace in the class. This deposi t is typically due within 30 days of receipt of an admission lette r. This fee will be applied to the differential tuition for the first semester of the professional program. 3. Differential Tuition. In 2012 the North Dakota Board of High er Education approved a differential tuition for the pharmacy professional program which is higher t han the standard university tuition rate. Differential tuition is needed to cover the highe r costs associated with a professional degree program. This differential tuition does not include other student fees, room and boards, and miscellaneous expens es. As noted earlier, stude nts are expected to complete certain degree requirements including Introductory Pharmacy Pra ctice Experience (IPPE) and Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience (APPE) during summer mont hs in addition to the regular academic year. Starting with the fall 2013 semester, st udents should expect to be charged (and to pay) differential tuition on course credits for all professional program degree requirements regardless of the term in which credits are earned . The amount of differential tuition in an academic term c an be found on the NDSU Financial Aid and Scholarships website: www.ndsu.edu/ones top/accounts/ . 4. An additional $100 fee is required. It will be applied to t he first year annual fee for registration as a Pharmacy Student Intern in N orth Dakota, with the North Da kota Board of Pharmacy. Note: this $100 annual fee for licensure as a student intern is required by the North Dakota Board of Pharmacy for four years of enrollment in the professio nal program. Once a student is accepted into the professional pharmacy program, he or she i s expected to continuously hold a valid North Dakota Pharmacy Intern license for the entir ety of their professional program. Reapplication A student who has made application to the professional program but is not accepted, who fails to enroll after being accepted or who was uns uccessful in the Early Admis sions Pathway program (EAP), may reapply for admission to the professional program. Students are allowed to apply to the program twice (including the EAP). Regardless of whether or not a student mee ts the eligibility r equirements, once a student pays the pharmacy applicat ion fee, that application off icially counts toward the limit of two attempts. All academic and admission requirements in force at t he time of his/her reapplication must be met. PLEASE NOTE The faculty reserve the right to change rules and regulations i ncluding those relating to admission, instruction and graduation. Su ch changes may apply to prospect ive students, as well as students already enrolled. Changes will be shared with students in a ti mely manner. However, it is the responsibility of the student to periodically contact their adv iser or the Dean's Office to obtain current policies.

An essentia l first step is the est ablishment of a patient- pharmacist relationship that s upports engagement and effective communication with pat ients, families, and caregivers throughout the proce ss. In addition, at the core of the process, pharmacists continually collaborate, document, and communi cate with physicians, other p harmacists, and other health care professionals in the provision o f safe, effective, and coordina ted care. This process is enhanced through the use of interoperable informati on technology sys tems that facili tate efficient and effective communication among all individuals involved in patient care. (Figure 1). Using principles of evidence- based practice, pharmacists: A. Collect The pharmacist assures the collect ion of necessary subjective a nd objective informati on about the patient in order to understand the relevan t medical/medication history and clinical status of the patient. Information may be gathered and verified from multiple sources including ex isting patient records , the patient, and other health care professionals. This process includes collecting: A current medication list and m edication use history for pres cription and nonprescription medications, herbal products, and other dietary supplements Relevant health data that may include medical history, health and wellness information, biometric testresults, and physica l assessment findings Patient lifestyle habits, pre ferences and beliefs, health and functional goals, and socioeconomic factors that affect access to medications and other aspects of care 58 B. Assess The pharmacist assesses the info rmation collect ed and analyzes the clinical effects of the patient's therapy in the context of the patient's overall health goals in order t o identify and prioritize problems and achieve optimal care. This proc ess includes assessing: Each medication for appropriat eness, effectiv eness, safety, a nd patient adherence Health and functional status, r isk factors, health data, cult ural factors, health lit eracy, and access to medications or other aspects of care Immunization status and the need for preventive care and othe r health care services, where appropriate C. Plan The pharmacist develops an indi vidualized pati ent-centered care plan, in collaboration with other health care professionals and the patient or ca regiver that is evidence-bas ed and cost-effective. Thi s process includes establishing a care plan that: Addresses medication-related problems and optimizes medicatio n therapy Sets goals of therapy for achiev ing clinical outcomes in the context of the patient's o verall health care goals and access to care Engages the patient th rough education, em powerment, and self- management Supports care continuity, inc luding follow-up and transitions of care as appropriate D. Implement The pharmacist implements the ca re plan in collaboration with o ther health care professionals and the patient or caregiver. During the process of implementing the ca re plan, the pharmacist: Addresses medication- and he alth-related problems and engages in preventive care strategies, including vaccine administration Initiates, modifies, discont inues, or administers medication therapy as authorized Provides education and self-management tr aining to the patien t or caregiver Contributes to coordination of c are, including the referral o r transition of the patient to another health care professional Schedules follow-up care as needed to achieve goals of therap y E. Follow-up: Monitor and Evaluate The pharmacist monitors and eval uates the effectiveness of the care plan and modifies the plan in collaboration with other health c are professionals and the pati ent or caregiver as needed. This process includes the continuous monito ring and evaluation of: Medication appropriateness, e ffectiveness, and safety and pat ient adherence through available health data, biometric test results, and patient feedback Clinical endpoints that contri bute to the patient's overall h ealth Outcomes of care, including pr ogress toward or the achievemen t of goals of therapy Information from PHARMACISTS' PATIENT CARE PROCESS MAY 29, 2014 59 NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY PROFESSIONAL PHARM ACY CURRICULUM (PRE-REQS) 2019/2020 Note: An additional 6 credits of Professional Electives MUST be completed PRIOR to P4 Year P1 (39 credits) FALL 2019 C r SPRING 2020 C r Micr 470, Basic Immunology 3 PSci 369, Pharmaceutics tical Biotechnology PSci 412, Chemotherapeutic Agents (Oncology/ID) (PSCI 411) 3 PSci 411, Principles of Dynamics 3 PSci 470, Pharmacokinetics (PSCI 3 Phrm Phrm Pathophysiology II 350, Introduction to Pharmacy Prax 2 Phrm 351L, Pharmacy Practice Lab I 2 Phrm 352, Introduction to Healthcar e Systems 2 Phrm 480, Drug Literature Evaluation 3 TOTAL 18 TOTAL 18 SUMMER 2019 - Phrm 355, Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experien ce (IPPE) I , 120 hours = 3 cr. * (All P1 classes) P2 (38 credits) FALL 2019 C r SPRING 2020 C r PSci 413, Endocrine/Resp/GI Dynamics (PHRM 340, 341, Interprofessional Health Care Practice (PHRM 355) 3 PSci 414, Cardiovascular Dynamics (PHRM 340, 3 (PHRM 340, Phrm Top Hematology and Oncology (PSCI 410, PSCI 412) 3 TOTAL 17 TOTAL 17 SUMMER 2019 - Phrm 455, IPPE II, 160 hours = 4 cr. * (P1 course work + PHRM 400, 450, 452L, & 565) P3 (30 credits) FALL 2019 C r SPRING 2020 C r Phrm 475, Pharmacy Man agement (PHRM 350, 352, 452L) (PHRM 532, 537, 538) 3 500, Top II (PHRM 400) 1 Phrm 552L, Pharmacy Pra ctice (PSCI PSCI 536, Mgmt (PHRM 475, PHRM 480) 2 Phrm 537, Renal, Fluid & Ele ctrolytes (PSCI 414) 2 Phrm 572, Pharmacy Law and Ethics (PHRM 350, 352, 452L) 3 Phrm 540, Public Health (PHRM 352) 3 Phrm Pharmacotherapy ractice Lab III (PHRM 452L) 2 TOTAL 18 TOTAL 15 P-4 (40 credits) 40 W eek Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience (APPE), Phrm 581 through 589, Rotations 1 through 9.

Cody Wiberg, Pharm.D ., Executive Director Minnesota State Board of Pharmacy 2829 SE University Ave., Suite 530 Minneapolis GRADUATE RESIDENCY FAQS What is a Pharmacy Residency? A pharmacy residency is an organi zed, mentored, post-graduate t raining program. Typically, a residency is completed directly after graduating from a Doctor of Pharmacy p rogram. However, some may choose to complete residency after prac ticing as a licensed pharmacist fo r a few years. What will I learn in a residency program? You will learn the k nowledge and gain the experience required o f pharmacists in various areas of practice, allowing you to further refine your clinical skills and bring y our pharmacy-based problem solving abilities to a higher level. You will have the opportunity to learn from pharm acists who are experts in their area of pharmacy, many of which have achieved addi tional board certifications. Why should I do a residency? This is an opportunity to bridge the gap between being a pharma cy student one day, and the next day being a licensed pharmacist. You will hav e the opportunity to fortify your strengths, strengthen your weaknesses, and develop confidence in your abilities as an individual pharm acist. Other benefits include a competitive advantage in the job market, networking opportunities, career p lanning, and attendance/part icipation at local and national meetings. M any clinical positions are now requirin g a residency. What is the duration of residency program? Each residency is typically one year. They start July 1 and con clude June 30 each year. Some residencies are offered in combination with a postgraduate degree (M.S., MB A). There are also some combination programs allowing you to complete both a PGY-1 and PGY-2 progra m over the course of 2 years. Additionally, there are non-traditional program s, where a pharmacist may comp lete their PGY-1 residency over two years. Are all residency programs the same? No. The type of residency you select will depend on your career objectives. Select a program that will prepare you for the type of job you event ually want to have. Some PGY-1 programs allow you to focus your residency based on your interest. In some ca ses, an individual may procee d with a second year of training to obtain this specialized experience. Examples of current residency types inc lude: PGY-1 (\"Pharmacy Practice\" or \"General\") Pediatrics Psychiatry Ambulatory Care Infectious Diseases Oncology Pharmacy Management Managed Care Critical Care Are residencies only for hospital-based programs? No. There are many ambulatory bas ed programs. In fact, these pr ograms are among the fastest growing type. Additionally, there are community pharmacy based programs. Do I get paid during this program? Yes. Most residencies pay roughl y $40,000-$45,000 for the year. Some programs allow the opportunity to pick-up extra pharmacist shifts to earn extra pay. Most program s offer fringe benefits (e.g. health care, investment opportunities, etc.). Also, you may be eligible for deferring payment on your student loans during the program. 63 I'm not sure what type of progr am is right for me. What do you suggest? The most common type of residenc y is a PGY-1 (\"Pharmacy Practic e\" or \"General\") residency. It covers a broad spectrum of practice ar eas and patient types. Required ex periences include acute care, ambulatory care, drug information, and practice management. In addition to these \"core\" elements, each program has various specialty areas to comp lete the training experience. Al so, a research project (in collaboration with one of your preceptors) is completed during the residency year. Som e programs include teaching/precepting opportunities in cooperation with an affiliated college of phar macy. Finally, programs have various service (\"staffing\") requirements. Typica lly, staffing requires functio ning as a pharmacist during evening and/or weekend hours. How do I apply for a residency program? PGY-1 and PGY-2 residencies (ASHP-accredited) require participa tion in the residency-matching program. This is a formal process that a ttempts to match applicants to t heir choice of programs and vice versa. Programs that are in the process of rec eiving accreditation may also par ticipate in the residency-matching program. Check with the individual program s to verify their accreditatio n, and match parti cipation status. To participate in the Match for a position designated as a PGY- 2 residency, an applicant must have already completed a PGY-1 residency, or currently be in training in a P GY-1 residency program that will be completed before the start of t he PGY-2 residency. Current PGY-1 residents who are interested in continuing their training in a PGY-2 residency offered by the same sponsor as the applicant's P GY-1 residency (e.g., the same or an affiliated organization) may be able to obtain the position through an Early Commitment Process. App licants who are committed to a position in this manner do not need to register for or participate in the M atch. After I complete this residenc y experience, what is next? You will have an advantage over man y of your peers regarding em ployment opportunities. More \"doors\" will be open to you, and you will have more freedom in your career c hoice. Many employers value residency- trained pharmacists, and some jobs require residency experience . Graduates of residency programs go on to the following: pharmacist posit ions (staff, specialist, manager , etc.) in their area of tra ining, faculty positions, specialty residency programs , or fellowship programs. How do I find out more about residency programs and where they are located? Here are a few good resources: https://www.ashp.org/Pr ofessional-Development/Residency-Informa tion, college's direc tors, and ASHP's Midyear Clinical Meeting, which showcases virtually all of the ASHP-accredited programs.

Public health is defined as the pr actice of helping members of society live healthier, longer lives. More specifically, public health focuses on improving the general he alth of communities through efforts to monitor the spread of diseases, initiati ves (both clinical and policy-o riented) to prevent diseas e and disability, and by promoting healthy lifestyles th rough education and community en gagement. Public health is both an art and a science. It is practiced by int er-professional teams whose me mbers' training spans a wide array of academic and vocational fields. Of particular importance to public health in our state is deter mining how to meet the challenges of change and diversity within rural areas. R ural health solutions are essen tial to the well-being of North Dakota and to other areas of the nation and the world. North Dakota is an ideal loc ation for rural public health research in addition to the application of practical s olutions to health improvement for rural communities. Public health is an interdisciplinary field; it is common for many people to gain c ompetencies and/or training in a related field (medicine, nursing, pharmacy, bus iness, engineering, etc.) and subsequently move into public health as a matter of vocation or occupati on. The MPH degree is uniquely de signed to accommodate the needs to these individuals. It blends theory and pr actical knowledge across a wide array of disciplines, and is the \"degree of choice\" among practiti oners in the field. There are three specializations t o choose from within the MPH d egree at NDSU. The specializations of Community Health Sciences or the Management of Infe ctious Diseases are the most suitable for most pharmacists, as they prepare health professionals to integrate public health initiatives and policies within traditional medical models. It is designed to provide pharmacis ts and other health professionals with a better understanding of their diverse roles in public health. For more information on the NDSU MPH program you can visit www.ndsu.edu/publichealth or contact the Academic Coordinator/Lecturer, Ste fanie Meyer, at Stefanie.meye r@ndsu.edu. PHARM.D./MPH DUAL DEGREE OPTION The Master of Public Health (MPH) offers diverse tracks in public health that build upon the stre ngths of campus to meet the practical needs of the public and health car e practitioners who serve it. Specializations at NDSU include community health sci ences, management of infectiou s diseases, and American Indian public health. The MPH degree consists of 42 cr edits and can be completed in t wo years as a full time graduate student. Pharm.D. students are abl e to complete a Pharm.D./MPH dual degree in as little as one extra year of study. Pharm.D. students who are in good academic standing a re eligible to apply for the Pharm.D./MPH program through the graduate school during their P2 year. Why Public Health? Practitioners in our region hav e limited opportunities for adva nced, practical public heal th training that focuses on the unique challenges facing this largely rural area that en compasses North Dakota and other Northern Plains states. There are many u nderserved populations living in the region that would benefit from expanded public health interventions. Fo r example, the American Indian c ommunities have typically been underserved and significant health disparities between this population and others have resulted. Overall, there is much to be gained from greater collaboration within the Northern Great Plains, and the education of public health professionals is a natural start ing point to facilitate that co llaboration. 68 Is the MPH accredited? Yes. T he Council on Education for Publ ic Health (CEPH) at its October 6-7, 2016, meeting acted to accredit the Master of Public Health Program at North Dakota State Universit y for a five-year term, extending to December 31, 2021. What are the admission requireme nts for the Pharm.D./MPH dual d egree? You must be enrolled in the Phar m.D. program and in good academ ic standing. In additi on to graduate school requirements (with the exception of the GRE; the PCAT score can be used inst ead for Pharm.D. students), the MPH Admissions Committee may invite selected applicants for an interview. How do I apply to the Pharm.D./MPH dual degree? You apply online during the spring semester of your P2 year thr ough the Graduate School at http://ndusndsugrad.askadmissions.n et/emtinterestpage.aspx?ip=a pplication and choose \"Public Health.\" If you are a P1 student and wish to get started early, apply onlin e at the above website but choose \"Non-Degree\" in the drop down box during the spring semester of your P1 year . This will allow you to take PHRM 632 for Graduate credit. Up to nine grad uate credits can be taken as a non-degree student. When can I start the MPH program? Applications are reviewed each year beginning March through May for a fall semester start. You may also take up to nine graduate credits as a non-degree seeking student wit h permission of the instructor. How much does it cost for MPH courses? Tuition and fees for MPH coursework can be found here: www.ndsu.edu/onestop/a ccounts/tuition/gra duate_tuition_fall_201 scholarships available? Yes. Scripts Sc holars Program offers scholarships for P harm.D. dual degree students. The program provides four (4) $10,000 scholar ships nationally each year to enrolled dual degree students. The awarded students are given $2,500 per semes ter for four consecutive sem esters, totaling $10,000 over two years. For application instructi ons, please contact: ExpressScriptsScholars@aacp.org . The College of Health Professions has a limited number of schol arships and awards available for assistance to students. Applications for scholarships and awards are avai lable February 1 of each calendar year on the college web page, www.ndsu.edu/healthprofessions . Deadlines vary. NOTE: Specific information related to criteria for selection of scho larship recipients is available in the Office of Development in Sudro Hall 120. When are MPH courses offered? MPH core courses are generally offered in the evening to accomm odate students who work. These courses are only offered in the Fall and Spring semesters. There are no summer core courses, although the MPH practicum may be completed during summer. Current students are encouraged to talk with their faculty advisors for the most up -to-date information on course offerings. Does the MPH program accommodate distance learners? MPH students can take their courses on campus at NDSU or off -campus through live video broadcasts of classes (IVN). Since I will not enroll in Phrm 555 IPPE III or Phrm 552L in th e P3/Public Health year, do I still need to complete the required online tr ainings (e.g. HIPAA, HIPAA Secur ity, NDSU P reventing Methamphetamine Abuse , etc.)? Yes. You will still need to compl ete the required trainings in the fall of your P3/Public Health year. In addition, you will need to be registered as a Pharmacy Intern in the stat e of North Dakota. 69 Can I take courses in more than one area of specialization? Yes, there is a list of electiv es in each specialization that a re available to all MPH students. You are welcome to take additional credits if you are interested. Can I change to a different specialization track after starting the MPH program? Yes. You must be in good academic standing within the MPH progr am and the admissions committee for the specialization you wish to enter must agree that your backgroun d is sufficient for the transition. Contact the Academic Coordinator/Lect urer if interested. Where can I do my Practicum? Can the Practicum be done in anoth er country? NDMPH has secured Practicum affi liation agreements with local, national, and global sites in public health. Students can also request a Practicum site without an existing affiliation agreement, but this must be done a minimum of 6 months in advance of the Practicum start date to e nsure that a working agreement can be established. Practicums can be d one in other countries as long as an acceptable agreement can be established beforehand. What are the hardware and software requirements for off -campus students? The ability of a student to succ eed in a distanc e education cla ss depends on his or her ability to understand both the course structure and the associated technology. Inform ing students of what skills and technology are needed for distanc e education allows t hem the opportunity t o self-evaluate their capability to succeed in the course. At the time of admission to the program, students are required to ensure that their computers meet the minimum hardware and software re quirements described below. Reg istration for the c ourse constitutes the student's understanding and acceptance of the requirements nece ssary to participate in the course.

After successful completion of 76 semester hours, interviews, a nd the Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT), students are admitted to a fou r-year professional program. The Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, one of six academic departments of the College of Health Professions, subscribes to the missions of the College and of N orth Dakota State University in the provision of Teaching, Research, and Service. T he Department provides instru ction in disciplines applicable to science. The faculty design and conduct research in the natural and biologic al sciences, as well as mentor graduate and Professional students in advanc ed concepts of pharmaceutical sc ience and in the process of scientific inquiry. NDSU offers both the MS and Ph.D. degrees in Pharmaceutical Sci ences. The graduate program emphasizes both research and teaching excellence. The doctor of philosophy degr ee is awarded in recognition of high scholarly achievement as evidenced by a per iod of successful study, the s atisfactory completion of examinations and the development of an acceptable dissertation project covering some significant aspect of a major field of learning and research. After successful completion of a Ph.D. degree program , students have had a high level of success gaining highly desirable employment i n academia, industry and governmen tal agencies. The dual program (Pharm.D./Ph.D.) is designed to provide an opp ortunity for outstanding pr ofessional students in the Pharmacy Program at North Dakota State University obtain re search experience and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences. It is proposed that this can be accomplished with an additional three years of study and research placed between the second and the third years of the four-year professional pr ogram. It is believed that the combinat ion of the Pharm.D. and Ph.D. d egrees will greatly enhance the student's research background, critical thinking skills, and marketability for lea dership positions within t he profession of Pharmacy in academic, government, and industrial environments. Summer Research Experience During the summer between the P1 and P2 years, up to six studen ts per year will be allowed into an introductory research experience phase of the Pharm.D./Ph.D. program and wil l spend twelve weeks rotating throughout these three research laboratories. A summer stipend will be provided for each participating student in return for a 20 hour/week commitment (These funds are to be obtained from the C ollege's differential tuition funds). Admission Students in the Doctor of Pharmacy program will make an applica tion to the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences by December 20h at the end of the fall term of their second year (P2) in the p rogram for acceptance into the Pharm.D./Ph.D. program. T hey should have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or above. At the same time, an application to the graduate school should also be made. The GRE should als o be taken by the end of this semester. Pharm.D./Ph.D. applications will be considered by the Departmen t as for all graduate students. Course requirements during the professional program The Pharm.D. curriculum is unchanged. In the fall semester of the P1 year, a faculty member(s) will make the students aware of the Pharm.D./P h.D. option, and briefly outlin e the program. 76 The Ph.D. Graduate Dissertat ion Years (i.e. G1, G2, G3) Students will receive a monthly stipend, and tuition waiver dur ing Ph.D. graduate year 1 (G1), year 2 (G2) and year 3 (G3). For this time period the students are full-time gradua te students in the Department, subject to the same expectations (e.g. seminar participation, 6 credits of PSCI 790 , year-round study, etc.). D uring the three graduate years, the students will be required to complete STAT 725 (3 c r), BIOC 701 (4 cr) and BIOC 702 (4 cr). In addition, if interested, students may take other 700-level courses availa ble in the department and university. Thus by the end of G3, the students will have a mi nimum of (12 cr) 600-level an d (up to 21 cr) 700-level didactic credits. At the end of three graduate years, students would be able to write disser tation and pass the final thesis examination. In addition to didactic credits, students will take 1 credit Semin ar (PSCI 790) in the fall and the Spring semesters of each of the three graduate years. Students will also be require d to take 60 thesis research credits (PSCI 799) during three graduate years. NOTE: Professional pharmacy students who are enrolled as a full or part time student at NDSU, and who are pursuing a joint degree with the Doctor of Pharmacy program , must complete all required pharmacy training as required by the Doctor of Pharmacy program (includi ng, but not limited to, training on HIPAA & Privacy, HIPAA & Security, Blood-borne Pathogens, Preventing Me dicare Fraud, Waste and Abuse, and Combating Methamphetamine Abuse) regardless of whether they are completing pharmacy academic or experiential credits in a given semester. These trainings are r equired until such time as the student graduates with a Doctor of Pharm acy degree or officially dis-en rolls in the Doctor of Pharmacy program. The Clinical Years (P3 & P4) For the final two years of the professional program, dual degre e students will receive a waiver of NDSU base tuition and pharmacy differential tuiti on. No changes in the didactic coursework of the P3 y ear are proposed. Program requirements for the participants Once accepted into the dual degree program (i.e. the G1 year an d beyond), the student is considered to be a full- time graduate student in the Department of Pharmaceutical Scien ces. They must maintain a GPA of 3.0 or above. Ph.D. Summary: 12 credits of 600 and at least 18 out of 21 suggested credits o f 700=30 didactic credits, with 6 credits seminar and 60 credits dissertation gives a total of 96 graduate credits. Up to 12 credits of 600 level courses can be used for the Pharm.D. P3 and P4 years will remain as it is in the traditional Pharm.D . program. Suggested Course Schedule for Pharm. D. /Ph.D. Students P-1 Year: It would remain the same. In summer, students are required to do a research rotation in three laboratories. Please contact the Department of Pharmaceutical S ciences (231-7661) for details. P-2 Year: It would remain G-1 Year: BIOC 701 (4 cr), BIOC 702 (4 cr), 725 (3 cr), PSCI 790 ( 2 cr), PSCI 799 (15 cr), PSCI cr), PSCI 670 (3 cr) G-2 Year: PSCI 790 (2 cr), PSCI 799 (25 cr), and at least any two of th e following 3 credit courses: PSCI 612/613/614/615 G-3 Year: PSCI cr) P-3 and P-4 Years: Unchanged Students interested in pursuing this option need to see Dr. Sin gh, the Chairman of Pharmaceutical Sciences, to begin the process.

Kappa Psi Kappa Psi is a professional, co-ed fraternity whose main purpos e is to unite its members and to help them become better professionals. We try to achieve this by being actively involved in community affairs, university affairs, and the College of Health Professions. Throughout our history, the Beta Sigma Chapter of Kappa Psi has maintained a stout brotherhood founded on industry, sobriety, fellowship, and high ideals. Our chapter ha s been involved in many community service events including volunteering for Bet hany Homes, the New Life Center, the American Diabetes Association, t he Ronald McDonald house, the A rthritis Foundation, Dor othy Day Food Pantry. We also provide a monthly meal a long with a blood pressure scre ening at low income hous ing in West Fargo. We consistently earn the highest cum ulative all-Greek GPA. We spo nsor an annual Homecoming pig roast, a faculty appreciation dinner, a Spring Formal, and other social activiti es. We are also active on the local, regional, and national levels of Kappa Psi. Kappa Psi was founded in May 1879 at the Russell Military Acade my in New Haven, Connec ticut. Initially, it was a medical pharmaceutical fraternity and continued as such until 1 924. At that time, by mutual agreement, the members of both professions decided to separate into two distin ct groups. The medical group became Theta Kappa Psi and the Pharmacy group became Kappa Psi. Our chapter was f ounded April 25, 1924 and was one of the 27 founding chapters of Kappa Psi Pharmaceutical Fraternity. Our chapter became co-ed in 1998. We continue to thrive on the North Dakota State campus as a source of brotherh ood for pharmacy students.

Native American Professional Program (NAPP) To address the critical shortage of Native American pharmacists in the United States, the College initiated NAPP (then known as the Native American Pharmacy Program) in Septemb er 1987. The program was designed to recruit and facilitate the entry of Native American students into the C ollege and provide them with counseling and retention services to increase their c hances for academic success. In 2009, NAPP members transformed t he program into a student or ganization and made it inclusive of all the majors within the College, thus changing the name from Native American Pharmacy Program to Native American Professional Programs. NAPP meets monthly to discuss a variety of topics related to th e knowledge and skills needed to pursue degrees offered by the College of Health Professions at NDSU. Counselin g and tutorial services for students, financial aid and scholarship information, and internship and future career o pportunities also are presented. The NDSU National Community Phar macists Association Student Cha pter (NCPA) NCPA is a national organization representing independent commun ity pharmacy practice. In 1987, the national office began a student outreach program that has founded studen t chapters in 41 colleges of pharmacy across the nation. The mission of the NCPA st udent outreach program is to foster entrepreneurial sp irit in pharmacy students and introduce them to opportunities in independent pharmacy pra ctice and ownership. 79 Established at NDSU in April 2000, the NCPA Student Chapter pro vides a forum for students to learn about the many career options available in independent community practice . The objectives of the chapter are to promote the profession of pharmacy and the role of independent pharmacy in the health care system, and to maintain and expand educational programs and st rengthen student members' pro fessional, business, and leadership abilities. Goals of the chapter are to sponsor pharmacists involved in an innovative practice to speak at meetings, start a management/ownership workshop for students interested in owning their own pharmacy, participate in service activities to the community, and to send students to the NCPA A nnual Convention in October of each year. Benefits of membership in the student chapter include a variety of scholarships, low interest student loans, and a student publication called The New Independent in addition to the national journal America's Pharmacist.

Describe your interprofessional active learning exercise: Given patient case scenarios, describe the role of each health professional to help achieve the best patient outcomes. Describe how you will assess learning: Multiple choice questions ACTIVE LEARNING 1. MT is a 49 year old female who underwent preemptive genetic screening. She is relatively healthy and the only medication she is taking is ibuprofen as needed for headache. Her genetic test came back with the following result: Patient has a mutation of her MLH1 gene which puts the patient at incre ased risk for certain types of cancer. Which of the following professionals would best be suited to explain the results to both the provider and the patient and help determine next steps? A. Licensed Practical Nurse B. Medical Laboratory Technologist C. Pharmacist D. Sonographer E. Genetic Counselor 2. In question 1, why did you select the answer that you did? Genetic counselors receive training on disease predispositions as a result of gene variants. A genetic counselor could explain to the patient, patient's family and provider about next steps for monitoring or more testing. LPNs, MLTs, pharmacists, and sonographers do not receive extensive training on the science or counseling patients on such sensitive health results. 3. Why are pharmacists best suited to review pharmac ogenetic test results? Pharmacists are the medication experts an d receive extensive training on drug metabolism. Genetic counselors receive little training in regards to pharmacogenetic variants and medications. Providers, such as physicians/nurse practitioners/physician assistants often have not had the training to address pharmacogenetic test results and often do not have the time to adequately review results for actionable items. 4. How do you foresee your career in health professions being impacted by precision medicine? Answers will vary ASSESSMENT 1. NS is a 46 year old female who underwent preemptive genetic screening. She is relatively healthy and the only medication she is taking is a daily multivitamin. Her genetic test came back with the following result: Patient has a mutation of her MUTYH gene which puts the patient at increased risk for colon cancer. Which of the following professionals would best be suited to explain the results to both the provider and the patient and help determine next steps? F. Pharmacist G. Licensed Practical Nurse H. Medical Laboratory Technologist I. Genetic Counselor J. Primary Care Provider (physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant) 2. DU is a 76 year old male who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention in the cath lab. CYP2C19 genotying is included in the order set. The cardiologist started the patient on clopidogrel (anti -platelet medication) while awaiting the results of the gene tic testing. CYP2C19 came back while patient was still hospitalized showing the patient as a poor metabolizer which would suggest the clopidogrel would not be effective for the patient. Which of the following professionals should take charge of changing th e orders from clopidogrel to either ticagrelor or prasugrel? A. Patient Scheduler B. Cardiologist C. Medical Laboratory Technologist D. Genetic Counselor E. Radiologic Technologist 3. LR is a 28 year old female with depression. Pharmacogenetic test results show patient is at increased risk for side effects and toxicity while on her current antidepressant. Recommendations for an alternative antidepressant medication would most likely be made by: a. Pharmacist b. Medical Assistant c. Respiratory Therapist d. Genetic Counselor e.

TEACHING METHODOLOGY: BLENDED LEARNING (Online plus face-to-face instruction) This is a 3-credit class and thus requires a minimum of 150 minutes instructional time per week. The 150 minutes are divided between an online Tegrity lecture (50 min) and face-to-face class time (100 min). The time you spend for pre-class readings and assignments is in addition to the 150 minutes of instructional time and complies with University requirements stating \"for every 1 credit, a minimum of 2 hours outside of class is required\" (http://bulletin.ndsu.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/academic-credit/). Each week, a new topic folder will open in Blackboard containing pre-class assignment instructions for the following week. It is important to complete all assignments prior to class so that you are prepared for the quiz and to put into practice what you have learned. REQUIRED STUDENT TEXTBOOK: There is no required text. Resources will be available through NDSU library e-journals or provided by instructor. If you are unsure how to access e-journal articles from the library, please visit with a librarian at your earliest convenience. COURSE OBJECTIVES: This course serves as the foundation to build upon the Core Competencies for Interprofessional Collaborative Practice (Interprofessional Education Collaborative (2016). Core D.C.: Interprofessional Education Collaborative). 1. Values/Ethics for Interprofessional Practice : Work with individuals of the healthcare team to maintain a climate of mutual respect and shared values. 2. Roles/Responsibilities in Interprofessional Practice: Use the knowledge of one's own role and those of other professions to appropriately assess and address the healthcare needs of the patient to promote and advance the health of populations. 3. Interprofessional Communication: Communicate with patients, families, communities, and professionals in health and other fields in a responsive and responsible manner that supports a team approach to the promotion and maintenance of health and the prevention and treatment of disease. 4.

PROGRAM-LEVEL EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES: Please see Blackboard for discipline-specific educational outcomes addressed in this course. CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION Student effort is expected and does not guarantee a passing grade. Grades are awarded based upon knowledge retention and demonstration of competency in the areas below. 1) Class Attendance and Professionalism (10 points/class): Students are allocated a total of 110 points at the beginning of the semester for attendance and professionalism. Deductions to this total will be made for unexcused absences and unprofessional behavior as detailed below. Attendance. According to NDSU Policy 333 attendance is expected and this class is no different. Therefore, unexcused absences will result in a 10-point deduction from the student's total points. In the event a student 1/2/2020 3 must miss class due to illness, they must notify their instructor by noon on the day they will be absent. Determination of excused vs. unexcused absences will be up to the instructor. Students who miss class due to an excused absence must complete a make-up assignment prior to the next class in order to receive the 10 attendance points. Professionalism. All students are required to exhibit professionalism in this class to foster a true spirit of interprofessional collaboration as demonstrated by the following: 1. Preparation : the extent of your reading, viewing the Tegrity lecture, and understanding the material as demonstrated by your contribution to discussion and performance on team quizzes. 2. Contribution: the extent you volunteered answers, asked relevant questions, expressed your own opinions, communicated knowledge specific to your role, and serving as team recorder. 3. Team skills: the extent you allowed others to contribute, avoided team domination, shared ideas with others, assisted others, solicited input from each member, provided positive feedback to others, and serving as team leader. 4. Communication skills: the quality of your expression, clarity, conciseness, use of appropriate vocabulary, volume, and confidence; displaying individual and team name at each class. 5. Mindfulness: includes punctuality, staying on task, and appropriate use of electronic devices. 6. Respect: evidenced by tolerance, treating others with dignity, including others in conversations, sitting by a member of a different discipline each week, and refraining from packing up until class is dismissed. Unprofessional behavior by 1 team member will result in a 10-point deduction for ALL team members . 2) Reflection Papers (2 total, 30 points each): Reflection and application are two critical components of the learning cycle. The reflection paper is designed to encourage both of these processes while helping you move your understanding of various topics from theory to practice. The format of the paper must be a minimum of 500 words, (typed, double spaced with 1 inch margins, 12-point font, with an Introduction, Body, and Conclusion) in which you demonstrate an understanding of the content, reflect on its significance, and discuss its application to your discipline or experiences. Papers must be submitted electronically to Safe-Assign on Blackboard by noon on the due date for full credit. Points are deducted for late assignments as follows: 10 points automatic deduction with an additional 5 points per day late. In addition to content, students are graded on spelling, grammar, and proper referencing. Please review the grading rubric on the last page of the syllabus. Students who struggle with writing are encouraged to make an appointment with the Center for Writers on campus ( https://www.ndsu.edu/cfwriters ). 3) Quizzes (12 total, 10 points each): Students are given 10 minutes at the beginning of each class to complete a 10-point online quiz over the readings and on-line lectures. Quizzes will be taken individually or as a team upon the discretion of the instructor. If the quiz is taken as a team, all students will receive the same team score. All quizzes are online; therefore, please plan appropriately so that you are able to complete the quiz in class. Pharmacy student quizzes will be administered through ExamSoft. 4) Interprofessional Health Care Practice Simulated Team Experience (100 points): Students will work in interprofessional teams with a standardized patient to formulate a team plan of care.

In this behavior -based training using interactive video, you will learn how to: Apply health literacy strategies to help patients understand and act on information to prevent opioid -related ADEs Identify individual risk factors, o pioid medications, and interactions that place individuals with chronic pain at increased risk for opioid -related ADEs Recognize the importance of a multidisciplinary, team -based approach to treating patients with chronic pain Demonstrate the ability to co mbine the principles of the Health Literate Care Model and the biopsychosocial model of chronic pain management through case study examples \" Prior to starting the simulation, please review the following information : http://health.gov/communication/interactiveHLCM/index.html http://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/abs/10.2217/ebo.13.469 *Note, you only need to read th e abstract, not the article . The abstract provides a good definition of the biopsychosocial model of chronic pain management. Gatchel is an authority on this topic. You will see how this approach is applied in the simulation. **Please note, you will use the next two pages to record answers that you will then enter into Blackboard** Dr. Katrina Lee, Pharmacist What is one thing you learned about verbal de -escalation of an agitated patient? What is one red flag that may indicate an illegitimate opioid prescription? Review Your Decisions as Dr. Katrina Lee. What were the outcome of your choices/decisions? Were they positive or negative? Please be honest; there is no change in your final score for indicating that your choice/decision had either a positive outcome or a negative outcome in the correct column. The program will explain ways for you to impro ve in future patient encounters if you click on the patient name/decision at the end of each character. Simulated Patient Name Outcome Positi ve Negative Mr. Anderson Mrs. Young Mr. Clausen Mr. DeSantos As a pharmacist, it is important to recognize and understand the perspective of other healthcare providers on the healthcare team. In some practice settings, clinical pharmacists work in pain management clinics and play a more active role in the patient i nteractions and decisions being made in the outpatient clinic setting. In the next two scenarios, you will gain additional knowledge an d understanding from reviewing these interactions and interventions that occur in a pain management clinic. Rhonda Cl ark, Nurse Opioids are one of the three key drug classes identified in the National Action Plan for ADE Prevention (ADE Action Plan) as initial targets. Which are the other two drug classes? Which of the following are health literacy strategies? Warm Greeting Eye Contact Graphics Plain language, free of medical terminology Speaking at a fast rate Speaking at a slow rate Limit content to key points for patients Make sure that key points are repeated to patients Limit time communicating with patients t o less than 30 seconds Use the teach back method Encourage patient participation Do not encourage patients to ask questions Review your decisions. What were the outcome of your choices/decisions? Were they positive or negative? Please be honest; there is no change in your final score for indicating that your choice/decision had either a positive outcome or a negative outcome in the correct column.

Participants: The activities will be done with the second -year medical students from UND (N=7 6) and P3 pharmacy students that are enrolled in PHRM 580 in Spring 2019 (N=8 6). APRIL 15, 2019 INTERPROFESSIONAL EDUCATION PART 2 - SIMULATION DAY This is the day when the actual interprofessional high -fidelity clinical simulation with medical students will take place. You will be participating in a 60 -min simulation activity that will be completed in your pre-assigned simulation group (2 -3 pharmacy and 2 -3 medical learners). Transport: On this da y, you are responsible for your own transport to UND. We strongly urge you to carpool and to arrive early (30-60 minutes prior your simulation time) as you will need extra time to either find a parking spot and/or to walk from the furthest edges of the parking lot. Parking: UND will make arrangements so you will be able to park in the designated student parking areas in the 3 lots adjacent to the medical school at no charge. You should not park in any specially signed areas, e.g. \"A\" zone parking, or admi nistrative parking as then you are responsible for paying any parking tickets received. Length: The simulation will last 60 minutes/group. The simulations for all groups will run from 1:00 -5:00 PM. At UND, we have 6 available simulation rooms and we wil l run 6 identical simulations simultaneously. Every 40 minutes, we will start a new set of 6 identical simulations. Please note that the actual start and finish time for the individual group simulations will vary depending on your randomly assigned group. The precise schedule with the time and your group members will be provided to you as soon as we finalize the schedule and randomize participants with UND. Based on your start time for the 60 min-simulation, please plan to arrive at the UND campus 30 -60 mi nutes prior to the simulation so you can find a parking slot and be in the Simulation Center on time as we are not able to postpone the simulation start to wait for your arrival.
