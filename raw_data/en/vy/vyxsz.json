Essential oils can help you stabilize your emotions and keep you in a positive mood, particularly during these hot summer months. Essential oils are important in natural healing and Ayurvedic sensory therapies. Connecting with plants through their aromatic essential oils benefits the mind, body, and spirit and brings about harmony both internally and externally. Essential oils or ayurvedic herbs can be useful during yoga and meditation practice, added into a spray mister with water, incorporated into your evening bath routine, or placed on pulse points on your body with a carrier oil. They are definitely a staple in a thorough self-care routine! The best carrier oils for Vata dosha types are sesame, almond, olive, and castor oils. The best carrier oils for Pitta dosha types are coconut, sunflower, and ghee (clarified butter). The best carrier oils for Kapha dosha types are sunflower and safflower oils. All doshas do well with jojoba oil. Essential oils or ayurvedic herbs that are perfect for pacifying Pitta through reducing physical heat and calming frustration in the mind include Sandalwood, Rose, Lavender, Peppermint, German Chamomile, and Lemon. These essential oils are cooling, calming, floral, and anti-inflammatory. Try a single essential oil listed below or make your own blend of them.

Let us know which ones are your favorite! Ayurvedic Aromatherapy Oils for the Summer Months: Sandalwood Essential Oil - This essential oil has a calming and cooling effect on the body and mind through relieving Pitta dosha. It helps to relieve fevers and burns and stops excessive sweating. It is especially helpful to help balance the body after too much time in the sun. This is a great option to incorporate into an after-sun body moisturizer. Rose Essential Oil - This essential oil calms, de-stresses, and balances a fiery Pitta dosha. When you are outside and overheated in the summertime, try spraying rose water directly onto your face and body. You can purchase it at a natural food store or add the essential oil into an 8-oz misting bottle filled with water. Rose essential oil is known to open the heart and connects your spirit to devotional love, thereby calming any self destructive and overly-fiery tendencies. Lavender Essential Oil - This essential oil soothes an overactive mind and spirit.The scent of lavender radiates a sense of bliss and serenity. It is a great option to use in the evening to wind down before sleep or when you are experiencing anxious moments. Lavender has a balancing effect and is able to cool when you are too hot or warm when you are too cold, making it the perfect essential oil to always have on hand. Peppermint Essential Oil - This essential oil is an obvious one for its cooling and refreshing qualities! Did you know that peppermint oil also helps to make the perfect summer bug spray? Add 1/2 teaspoon peppermint essential oil and 1 tablespoon natural liquid dish or hand soap to 1/2 cup water. Add all of the ingredients to a spray bottle and shake before using! German Chamomile Essential Oil - This essential oil has a sweet, herbaceous, and apple-like aroma. The plant itself is generally used as an anti-inflammatory and the tea is a commonly known digestive aid. Therefore, the essential oil has similar effects on the mind and spirit and relieves feelings of anxiety, anger, and depression. Lemon Essential Oil - This citrus essential oil is great for uplifting your mood. It literally smells like sunshine! It is a wonderful option for dissipating feelings of depression, impurity, or indecisiveness. It is also great if you live in a climate where you do not receive a lot of sunshine. This essential oil may be photosensitizing for some people so use caution when putting directly on skin. Have questions for Made by Yoke about essential oils?
