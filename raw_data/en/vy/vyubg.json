The earliest surviving texts about Traditional Chinese Medicine were written before the Common Era, more than 2,000 years ago. More than 40,000 volumes written in Chinese were available prior to 1900. In China the practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine includes many specialties and subspecialties, and many Chinese physicians train both in TCM and in the Western system of allopathic medicine. Although [acupuncture](https://mccormickandassociatesacupuncture.com/acupuncture-frederick/) is the modality of TCM most widely practiced in the United States, in China itself more of TCM practice consists of herbal medicine. Herbal medicine is a powerful therapeutic system of healing. The strength of herbal medicine comes from the practitioner's training and skill in assessing each client's constitution and in taking each individual's constitution as the starting point for understanding the symptoms and imbalances as presented by that client. For example, if one client with a headache has weak digestion or constipation as a longstanding pattern in the client's constitution, and another client with a headache digests everything she eats and enjoys regular elimination, the best herbal formulas for these two clients may be very different, even though their headache symptoms would appear similar to a physician practicing Western allopathic medicine. Chinese herbal formularies have thousands of different therapeutic combinations of herbs. [Alice McCormick McClain](https://mccormickandassociatesacupuncture.com/alice-mccormick-mcclain/) studied and became conversant with much of this vast array of herbal remedies as a student and teacher of Traditional Chinese Medicine. In her current practice, Alice stocks about one hundred fifty standard combinations of herbs that she has found to be the combinations most frequently beneficial to her clients. All these herbs are prepared in the United States under the direction of practitioners who were born and trained in China. Alice is also trained in the preparation and use of other herbs and combinations of herbs that are needed much less frequently, or that are not readily available in commercial preparations in the United States; when necessary, she personally prepares appropriate herbal treatments for her clients.
