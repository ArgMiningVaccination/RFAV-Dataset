Each point represents one protein, one carb, and one fat. This means, for example, that a 12 point plan would consist of 12 protein servings, 12 carb servings, and 12 fat servings. The food list is broken down into single point servings. It is also categorized by macronutrient (protein/carbs/fats). You will notice that carbs are further broken down into their own three categories: starchy, veggie, and fruit. There are recommendations on your plan for when to (and when not to) eat each type of carb. We recommend you break your points up into 3-5 meals per day. An example of this for a 12 point plan would be: B r e a k f a s t 3 p o i n t s S n a c k 1 p o i n t L u n c h 3 p o i n t s s n a c k 1 p o i n t D i n n e r 4 p o i n t sNow that you know how the points work, I will give you an example of a 3 and 4 point meal to help you understand (please refer to your food list). For a 3 point meal, you will select 3 proteins, 3 carbs, and 3 fats. Remember, every item on the list is a single serving. This means you either triple the serving or select multiple items adding up to the total (in this case 3). 3 oz Chicken 3 Tbsp Avocado 1/4 cup sweet potato, mashed 2 1/2 cup broccoli 4 oz Chicken 4

Supplement Multivitamin BCAA's Omega 3/Fish OilF A Q If you find yourself hungry, use higher volume foods (ex - nuts instead of oils, sweet potatoes vs rice). The opposite applies if you are full or don't find yourself overly hungry. Use lower volume foods to help reduce overall food volume. Depending on previous habits, you may find yourself hungry or stuffed when starting a new nutrition protocol. This is completely normal. Its VERY important to follow the meal plan as written and consume all foods on the list. Adjustments can be made after the first few weeks according to progress. All protein is measured in cooked weight. Any carbs that expand, such as rice, oats, etc. are also listed in cooked measurements. All foods on the food list are portioned into single point serving sizes. For example, 1 point of protein = 1 oz chicken. This means 4 points protein = 4 oz chicken. Don't worry about timing your meals. Meal timing is considered a \"Tier 2\" task. Until you are eating the right quantity of foods from the right quality, on a CONSISTENT basis (think, 98% of the time), we don't worry about meal timing. Don't worry about any crossover macronutrients. Any fats in your protein or carbs in your fats are already calculated in. Just follow the plan as written. If you are eating foods off list, use the grams per point to determine fit (but beware, sticking to the list provided lends best results!): 1 Point: Protein = "}
