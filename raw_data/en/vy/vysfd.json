Specifically, by adapting the concept of \"CIPT\", we are getting inspiration from natural cells to design our delivery tools and particularly interested in engineering cells and cell derivatives as vehicles for delivery of small/macro molecules, proteins, and antibodies to treat a broad array of diseases, including cancer, infectious disease and auto immune disease. We are also leveraging the interaction between synthetic materials and immune cells to modulate immune response in a controllable fashion. To advance the personalized therapy, neoantigen-based vaccination and microbiota research will be emphasized in our lab to transform traditional \"one-size-fit-all\" treatment to precision medicine for each individual. Prof. Hu received his Ph.D. degree in Biomedical Engineering from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University under the supervision of Prof. Zhen Gu in 2018. From 2018-2020, he was a postdoc associate in the laboratory of Prof. Robert Langer in Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT. Prof. Hu joined UW-Madison in 2020 as an assistant professor in the Pharmaceutical Sciences Division at the School of Pharmacy. 2020-present, Assistant Professor, Pharmaceutical Sciences Division, School of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin-Madison Wisconsin, USA 2018-2020, Postdoc Associate, Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Department of Chemical Engineering Massachusetts, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), USA 2014-2018, Ph.D. Joint Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill | North Carolina State University, USA 2011-2014, M.S.
