WHY I DECIDED TO BECOME A CHIROPRACTOR After practicing in Florida, I decided to become a chiropractor in the Huntersville, NC/Concord, NC area to be closer to family and because the Huntersville, NC/Concord, NC area is a unique and special area. Becoming a chiropractor in the Huntersville, NC/Concord, NC area has allowed me to live within close proximity to the mountains and the ocean, and to live and work with the exceptional people in the area. The Huntersville, NC/Concord, NC area is populated with health-conscience individuals who recognize the benefits of healthy living through exercise and diet. These individuals are on the forefront of true health, seeking answers and actively participating in their health. What sets our clinic apart from other nearby clinics is our genuine concern for patients' time, money and health. In addition to chiropractic adjustments, we perform physiotherapy at most appointments (electrical stimulation, ultrasound, traction, and stretching and rehab exercises). The care you will receive here will be comprehensive\u2014focusing not only on alleviating symptoms, but just as important, prevention of re-occurrence through rehabilitation and lifestyle modification. We treat each patient individually, which means treatment plans based on the individual's problem. Most patients achieve their treatment goals in a shorter period of time than at other clinics, and thus do not have to spend months coming for treatment\u2014saving them time, money and most importantly, feeling great! SYMPTOMS COMMON CONDITIONS & SYMPTOMS WE TREAT In addition to common conditions such as low back pain, neck pain, upper back pain, sciatica and headaches, we successfully treat a number of other conditions. We also treat shoulder pain, hip pain, elbow and wrist pain, knee and ankle pain as well as other musculoskeletal problems. What many do not realize is how successfully we treat a number of non-musculoskeletal problems. Through acupuncture, we have successfully treated gastrointestinal problems such as irritable bowel syndrome, constipation and abdominal pain. Patients also come to us for acupuncture treatment for infertility, anxiety/depression, hot flashes and many other conditions. Some people in our area believe that chiropractic care is completely removed from medical care. This is not the case, as we work with a diverse group of providers, including, physical therapists, primary care doctors, pain management and orthopedic doctors. Also, many people believe they must first see their medical doctor prior to receiving treatment in our clinic. In most instances, this is not the case, and when medical care is necessary, we do not hesitate to refer patients to medical doctors, physical therapists and other providers.
