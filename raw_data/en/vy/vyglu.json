Ronica Perez graduated summa cum laude from the National University of Health Sciences with a Master's Degree in Acupuncture. She is a licensed acupuncturist in the state of Illinois. She became interested in Chinese medicine when she wasn't satisfied with the answers she was getting about health and healing, especially for her children. Someone had suggested to her that she see a 'Chinese Doctor' for her concerns. Because she knew nothing about this type of medicine and had heard so many warnings about the dangers of herbal medicine, she had to do some investigating. What she found was that not only did she want to start seeing these 'Chinese Doctors' but she wanted to become one. She went to the National University of Health Sciences to hear Dr. Kwon talk about acupuncture and oriental medicine. Dr. Kwon talked about how to treat the common cold. Using Chinese medical theories, he explained how one medicine would not work on all individuals who have a cold. He pointed to the people in the lecture and said though everyone in the room had a cold, this one had a fever, this one had a sore throat, this one had a clear, runny nose, and this one had chills. Chinese medicine looks at each person and records each symptom to make a prescription and treatment plan that is unique and specific to each individual. After listening to Dr. Kwon, she had to learn more, and immediately enrolled in the Master's program for Acupuncture. Ronica also incorporates ZYTO biofeedback technology. Using this extraordinary modern technology with the wisdom of the ancient philosophies, she is able to give each patient insight as to why they are experiencing discomforts and develop a plan not only to treat the current symptoms but also to try to prevent them from occurring again. Chinese medicine requires the practitioner to be skilled at listening to patients and finding the 'root cause' of complaints. Patients are able to take more responsibility for their health and learn about the amazing healing capabilities of the human body. Instead of feeling \"Why does this type of stuff always happen to me...,\" the patient becomes empowered to change and to heal. The effects of the acupuncture treatments continue to amaze Ronica. She is constantly educating herself about this medicine that is thousands of years old and is honored to be able to share this knowledge with others. 5 Element Acupuncture: The 5 Element Theory in Traditional Chinese Medicine organizes the body into 5 functioning organ systems that correspond with an element in nature: Earth (Digestion/Spleen), Metal (Respiratory/Lungs), Water (Bones and Growth/Kidneys), Wood (Detoxification/Liver), and Fire (Cardiovascular/Heart). The acupuncturist will identify blockages in these systems through face and tongue analysis and by symptom descriptions to come up with a unique treatment plan that restores balance to the body. Frist appointment $120 Follow-up sessions $85 Follow-up sessions to treatment: $25 HOW DOES ACUPUNCTURE WORK? The classical Chinese explanation is that Qi (chee), an energetic substance, flows through our body in channels called meridians, just as blood flows through our veins. The Qi should be flowing harmoniously throughout the body but certain factors lead to this flow becoming disrupted. Factors that may lead to Qi not flowing properly include stress, over-taxation, or a poor diet to name a few. Pain, illness, or disease may result when the body is not in a state of balance. The meridians can be influenced by needling the specific acupuncture points located on different parts of the body. The acupuncture needles unblock these obstructions, and reestablish the regular flow through the meridians to restore the body to a state of balance. In a balanced state, the body is more able to resist invasions, heal from injuries, attain mental and emotional clarity, handle stress, and much more. The modern scientific explanation is that needling the acupuncture points stimulates the nervous system to release chemicals in the muscles, spinal cord, and brain. These chemicals will either change the experience of pain, or they will trigger the release of other chemicals and hormones which influence the body's own internal regulating system. The improved energy and biochemical balance produced by acupuncture results in stimulating the body's natural healing abilities, and in promoting physical and emotional well-being. HOW MANY TREATMENTS WILL I NEED? The number of treatments needed differs from person to person. For complex or long-standing conditions, more treatments would be needed. I recommend two or three treatments a week for the first two weeks. After that, symptoms are reassessed and more treatments may be recommended, averaging 12-15 treatments a year. For acute problems, usually fewer visits are required. Some patients experience immediate relief, some experience pain relief two or three days after their treatment. If pain keeps coming back, more treatments may be needed along with lifestyle changes to prevent condition from occurring in the future. Health maintenance is based on individual preference. Some patients enjoy the time put aside for acupuncture as a time to unwind and relax while experiencing the health benefits that come along with it. Usually not. As energy is redirected in the body, internal chemicals and hormones are stimulated and healing begins to take place. Occasionally the original symptoms worsen for a few days, or other general changes in appetite, sleep, bowel or urination patterns, or a change in emotional state may be triggered. These should not cause concern, as they are simply indications that the acupuncture is starting to work. It is quite common with the first one or two treatments to have a sensation of deep relaxation or even mild disorientation immediately following the treatment. These pass within a short time, and never require anything more than a bit of rest to overcome. Most people report feeling calm, relaxed and happy. ARE THERE ANY SIDE EFFECTS TO THE TREATMENT? WHAT IS THE LASER ACUPUNCTURE? Rather than using the needles to stimulate the acupuncture points, a cold laser is used. Up to 12 different laser probes can be placed onto the acupuncture points to increase circulation and decrease inflammation in the body. The laser device also is able to transmit different frequencies, such as the Nogier frequencies and Chakra frequencies, which will be determined by the practitioner to encourage a specific healing response to a targeted area of the body. The treatment is painless and very relaxing. Yes. Our clinic works with individuals trying on their own naturally to conceive or together with fertility clinics to help calm the body, balance hormones and support the body in having a baby. The acupuncture is combined with the Biofeedback to search for stressed systems in the body that we need to support and also used to help address the emotional issues connected to these trying times. CAN ACUPUNCTURE HELP WITH FERTILITY? Based on the complaints of the individual, results from the ZYTO scan and tongue diagnosis, the acupuncturist will help one to make informed dietary recommendations based on the unique body type of that individual. Dietary restrictions may be included to determine foods that may be causing an imbalance in the system. Food recommendations as long as supplemental support will be advised. Natural Healing Centers offers whole food supplements, herbal tonics and homeopathic remedies to aid the body in healing. These supplements are muscle tested for each individual. The practitioner will explain why the remedy is recommended and what to expect while taking it. NUTRITIONAL ADVICE DO I HAVE TO BELIEVE IN ACUPUNCTURE FOR IT TO WORK? No. Acupuncture is used successfully on cats, dogs, horses and other animals. These animal patients do not understand or believe in the process that helps them get better. A positive attitude toward wellness may reinforce the effects of the treatment received, just as a negative attitude may hinder the effects of acupuncture or any other treatment. A neutral attitude (\"I don't know if I really believe in this.\") will not block the treatment results.
