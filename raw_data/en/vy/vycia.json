Course Summary 2018 was the 100th anniversary of one of the largest and most devastating flu pandemics in modern history in which more people died than in all of World War I. This course describes the current and historical impact of influenza, seasonal and pandemic. It includes influenza epidemiology, virus types and subtypes, how influenza viruses drift and shift, and a review of the worldwide impact of the 1918-1919 flu pandemic. We also discuss the goal of universal vaccination, diagnosis, and treatment, and the composition of the 2020 influenza vaccines.COI Support Accredited status does not imply endorsement by ATrain Education or any accrediting agency of any products discussed or displayed in this course.

Describe the 4 types of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine that are approved for the 2019-2020 season. 11. Explain the makeup of the 2019-2020 influenza vaccine. The Scourge of Influenza During the recent severe 2017-2018 influenza season, vaccination is. . . estimated to have prevented 7.1 million illnesses, 3.7 million medical visits, 109,000 hospitalizations, and 8,000 deaths, despite an overall estimated vaccine effectiveness of 38% (Grohskopf et al., 2019). Influenza is one of the deadliest viruses in the world, yet we take for granted that we are protected from its ill effects. We are deathly afraid of other viral infections, any of which kill only a fraction of the people that die each year from influenza. Yet many of us skip our annual flu shots, giving various excuses for forgoing the vaccine. This is despite the fact that the impact of influenza is enormous\u2014 estimated to be about 1 billion cases worldwide with death in nearly half a million people.The 2017-2018 influenza season was severe, with high levels of outpatient clinic and emergency department (ED) visits for influenza-like illness (ILI), high influenza-related hospitalization rates, and elevated and geographically widespread influenza activity for an extended period. In 2017 the Centers for Disease and Prevention (CDC) began using new methodology to classify seasonal severity and applied the methodology to the 2003-2004 through 2016-2017 seasons. The 2017- 2018 season was the first season to be classified as high severity across all age groups (CDC, 2019q). The 2018-2019 influenza season was of moderate severity and differed from recent seasons in that there were two waves of influenza A activity of similar magnitude. It was also longer than recent seasons with activity at or above baseline for 21 consecutive weeks. Overall, hospitalization rates were below those of the previous season, but rates for children under 17 years of age were similar to the previous year (Xu et al., 2019). Influenza is a clever virus\u2014it shifts, drifts, and adapts, every so often mutating into a virus to which humans have little or no immunity. When this happens, a pandemic can occur, as in 1918 when a devastating influenza pandemic killed tens of millions of people throughout the world. Some of us lost grandparents, aunts, or uncles to the 1918 pandemic. All influenza A pandemics since that time, and almost all cases of influenza A worldwide, ha ve been caused by descendants of the 1918 H1N1 virus (Taubenberger & Morens, 2006). One hundred years ago the 1918 influenza pandemic devastated entire communities and took an estimated 675,000 American lives. It was the most severe pandemic in recent history, sweeping the globe quickly and killing more than 50 million people. Source: CDC. Online Resource Video: 1918 Pandemic (1:31) https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-commemoration/index.htm Even if you are not familiar with the 1918 pandemic, you may be aware of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic\u2014the first global influenza pandemic in more than forty years. It was caused by the emergence of a novel* H1N1 influenza strain that reminded us just how serious an influenza pandemic can be. By the time the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the pandemic officially over in August 2010, the CDC estimated that 43 to 89 million people in the United States had become infected and more than 12,000 had died. It is estimated that worldwide between 151,700 and 575,400 people died from 2009 H1N1 virus infection during the first y ear the virus circulated (CDC, 2018d).*Novel: New (novel) influenza viruses are different from those currently circulating. This can include highly pathogenic influenza A viruses (H1N1, H5N1, H7N3, and H7N9). Influenza experts believ e that another influenza pandemic will occur \u2014likely caused b y an influenza subtype to which there is little or no pre-existing immunit y in the human population. Ev en though the H1N1 pandemic of 2009 is officially o ver, the H1N1 virus continues to circulate as a seasonal virus and is expected to do so for sev eral years. F ortunately , most (although not all) countries have dev eloped influenza v accines that protect against the H1N1 virus. Influenz a Virus Types and Subtypes There are three kinds of influenza: A, B , and C. Influenza B and C aren' t much to worry about, at most causing minor illness. The influenza A viruses, b y contr ast, are highly variable and so ha ve the potential to outwit the human immune system and cause a pandemic. Henry Nicholls Pandemic Influenza: The Inside Story It is helpful to understand a little bit about the influenza virus\u2014the different t ypes, how they are named, and how they mutate. The more y ou know , the better y ou will be able to protect y our patients, friends, and family members from catching the flu. Influenza viruses are categoriz ed and named b y type. There are three t ypes of influenza viruses\u2014 A, B, and C. T ype is determined b y the material within the nucleus of the virus. Left: The influenza virus. Copyright Zygote Media Group.

The nomenclature used to describe a specific influenza virus w as established b y the W orld Health Organization in 1980 and is expressed in this order: Virus t ype, 1. Geogr aphic site where the virus w as first isolated, 2. Strain or lineage number , 3. Year of isolation, and 4.For example, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus w as named as follows: A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) This is tr anslated as: Influenza t ype A, isolated first in California, lineage (str ain) number 04, y ear 2009, and t ype H1N1. In the image below , a Fujian influenza virus that circulated in 2002 w as named as follows: A/Fujian/411/2002 (H3N2) This is tr anslated as: Influenza t ype A, first isolated in Fujian (a pro vince on the Southeast coast of mainland China), lineage number 411, y ear 2002, t ype H3N2. Influenza Virus Nomenclature Influenza virus nomenclature (for a Fujian flu virus). Source: Wikipedia.org The Fujian H3N2 influenza of 2002 caused an unusually sev ere 2003-2004 flu season, partly because it spread r apidly and partly because the v accine for that season had already been formulated when the Fujian H3N2 virus w as identified. Type A Influenza and Its Subtypes Type A influenza viruses are divided into subtypes , based on the presence of two gly coproteins on the surface of the virus. These gly coproteins are called hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) . About 18 hemagglutinins ha ve been identified, although gener ally, only H1, H2, and H3 are found in human influenza viruses. There are more than 100 t ypes of neuraminidase, but only N1 and N2 ha ve been positiv ely link ed to influenza epidemics in humans. Virus protein antigen subt ype described b y letter and number , H1 to H16 and N1 to N9 (CDC, 2015PB)5. The above image shows the feat ures of an influenza virus, including the surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) an d neuraminidase (NA). Following influenza infection or receipt of the influenza vaccine, the body's immune system develops antibodies that recognize and bind to \"antigenic sites,\" which are regions found on an influenza virus's surface proteins. By binding to these antigenic sites, antibodies neutralize flu viruses and prevent them from causing further infection. Source: CD C. Hemagglutinin and neur aminidase are also called antigens , substances that, when introduced into the body , stimulate the production of an antibody . Currently , there are two subt ypes of influenza A viruses found circulating among human populations: influenza A (H1N1) and influenza A (H3N2). Wild Birds Provide the Usual Reservoirs A reservoir is the place where a pathogen liv es and surviv es. For all subt ypes of influenza A viruses, wild birds are the primary natur al reserv oir and are thought to be the source of influenza A viruses in all other animals. Influenza A viruses are found in man y different animals, including ducks, chick ens, pigs, whales, horses, and seals. Most influenza viruses cause asymptomatic or mild infection in birds; howev er, clinical signs in birds v ary greatly depending on the virus. Infection with certain a vian influenza A viruses (for example, some H5 and H7 viruses) can cause widespread, sev ere disease and death among some species of birds (CDC, 2018a).

During the outbreak, there were 135 confirmed human infections with H7N9, the v ast majorit y during the month of April. Man y of the people infected with H7N9 reported contact with poultry . By A ugust 2013, 45 people had died (Chen et al., 2013). The H7N9 virus had previously been detected in birds but had nev er been seen in humans or an y other animals prior to this outbreak. Annual epidemics of spor adic human infections with Asian- lineage a vian influenza A (H7N9) virus (\" Asian H7N9\") in China have been reported since March 2013. In late 2016, China experienced its fifth epidemic of Asian H7N9 human infections. This w as the largest annual epidemic to date. As of September 13, 2017, the W orld Health Organization reported 764 human infections with Asian H7N9 virus during the fifth epidemic. During epidemics one through four , about 40% of people confirmed with Asian H7N9 virus infection died (CDC, 2018a). Genetic Evolution of H7N9 Virus in China, 2013 The eight genes of the H7N9 virus are closely related to avian influenza viruses found in domestic ducks, wild birds, and domestic poultry in Asia. The virus likely emerged from \"reassortment,\" a process in which two or more influenza viruses co-infect a single host and exchange genes. This can result in the creation of a new influenza virus. Source: CD C, 2014. Type A I nfluenza Viruses C irculate in Pigs Pigs are susceptible to a vian, human, and swine flu viruses and can potentially be infected with influenza viruses from different species at the same time. If this happens, it is possible for the genes of these viruses to mix ( reassort) and create a new virus.Influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs are called \"v ariant \" viruses when they are found in people and denoted with a letter \"v .\" H3N2v viruses from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus were first detected in people in 2011 and were responsible for a multi-state outbreak in the summer of 2012 that resulted in 306 cases, including 16 hospitalizations and 1 fatalit y (CDC, 2019j). Most cases of H3N2v identified during 2012 were associated with exposure to pigs at agricultur al fairs. Man y fairs ha ve swine barns where pigs from different places come in close contact with each other and with people. These v enues ma y allow the spread of influenza viruses both among pigs and between pigs and people. Infected pigs can spread influenza viruses ev en if they are not symptomatic. Although instances of limited person-to-person spread of this virus ha ve been identified in the past, sustained or communit y-wide tr ansmission of H3N2v has not occurred (CDC, 2019j). Type B Influenza Influenza t ype B viruses are separ ated into two genetic lineages (B/Y amagata and B/Victoria). They are not classified b y subt ype lik e influenza A viruses. Influenza B viruses from both the Yamagata and Victoria lineages ha ve co-circulated in most recent influenza seasons. The triv alent influenza v accines a vailable in recent seasons ha ve contained one influenza B virus, representing only the Y amagata lineage. The quadriv alent v accine for 2019-2020 will contain both the Yamagata and Victoria lineages (CDC, 2019f ). Influenza t ype B viruses are usually found only in humans, and can cause morbidit y and mortalit y among humans, but in gener al are associated with less sev ere epidemics than influenza A viruses. Although influenza t ype B viruses can cause human epidemics , they ha ve not caused pandemics . Influenza B viruses undergo genetic changes less r apidly than influenza A viruses. Type C Influenza Influenza t ype C is less common and less studied than influenza A and B . It can cause illness in humans and pigs, and it is thought that most people are exposed to influenza C during childhood. The influenza C virus lacks the multiple subt ypes (hemagglutinin and neur aminidase) found in influenza A, which limits its abilit y to mutate. Influenza C is thought to be unlik ely to cause a pandemic, although localiz ed epidemics ha ve occurred. As with t ype B influenza viruses, t ype C influenza viruses are not classified according to subt ype. Types of Influenza Virus Influenza type Characteristics Type A Causes moderate to severe illness Occurs in all age groups Affects humans and other animals Type B Causes milder disease than type A Affects primarily children Occurs in humans only Type C Reported rarely in humans No epidemics Drifting and Shifting To successfully infect a person, the influenza virus must dev elop w ays to ev ade a person' s immune system. Viruses do this through ev olutionary processes called antigenic drift and antigenic shift. Influenza t ype A viruses undergo both kinds of changes, while influenza t ype B and C viruses change only b y the gr adual process of antigenic drift. Antigenic Drift: Continual Small Changes Antigenic drift involves continual small changes or mutations to a virus' s surface antigens (HA or NA). Think of a small boat drifting across the ocean or clouds drifting across the sky . These changes produce new vir al strains that are fairly closely related to one another and ma y be recogniz ed by the immune system (sometimes called \"cross-protection\"). Changes due to antigenic drift can nev ertheless accumulate o ver time, str aining the abilit y of a person' s immune system to recogniz e the new virus. Like clouds drifting across the sky, antigenic drift involves small, continual changes to a virus's surface antigens. Source: Wi kipedia Commons. Like this lightning storm near New Boston, Texas, antigenic shift involves major, abrupt changes in surface antigens (HA or NA). Source: Griffinstorm, Wikipedia Commons.In most y ears, one or two of the virus str ains in the influenza v accine are updated to k eep up with the changes in the circulating flu viruses. Changes in viruses due to antigenic drift can cause widespread infection because the protection that remains from past exposures to similar viruses is incomplete. Drift occurs in all three t ypes of influenza virus (A, B , C). Antigenic Shift, a Major, Abrupt Change Antigenic shift is a major , abrupt change in one or both surface antigens (HA or NA). Shift occurs at varying interv als and lik ely is the result of reassortment ( the ex change of a gene segment) between influenza A viruses, usually those that affect humans and birds. Antigenic shift results in a new influenza A subt ype that is so different from previous subt ypes in humans that most people do not ha ve immunit y to the new virus. An antigenic shift can lead to a worldwide pandemic if the virus is efficiently tr ansmitted from person to person. An example of a \"shift \" occurred in the spring of 2009, when a novel H1N1 virus with a new combination of genes (from American pigs, Eur asian pigs, birds, and humans) emerged in people and quickly spread, causing a pandemic. Since the late nineteenth century , four occurrences of antigenic shift ha ve led to major influenza pandemics. Although influenza viruses constantly and gr adually change b y antigenic drift, antigenic shift happens only occasionally . When a type A virus undergoes both kinds of changes, it is capable of ev ading host immunit y, with profound implications for epidemiology and control. This is the main reason wh y seasonal influenza v accines are updated frequently , to maintain protection in risk groups against currently circulating str ains (Arinaminpath y & Grenfell, 2010). Influenza Virus: Antigenic Changes Antigenic drift minor, continual changes, same subtype caused by point mutations in gene may result in epidemic Antigenic shift major, abrupt changes, new subtype caused by exchange of gene segments may result in pandemic Antigenic Drift and Shift of Influenza Strains Antigenic drift vs. shift. Antigenic drift creates influenza viruses with slightly modified antigens, while antigenic shift generates viruses with entirely new antigens (shown in red). Source: Wi kipedia Commons and USDA.

This virus w as originally referred to as \"swine flu\" because labor atory testing showed that man y of the genes in this new virus were v ery similar to influenza viruses that normally occur in pigs in North America. Further study , howev er, showed that this new virus w as very different from the one that formerly circulated in North American pigs. It has two genes from flu viruses that ha ve circulated in pigs in Europe and Asia, plus bird (a vian) genes and human genes. Scientists call this a quadruple reassortant virus (CDC, 2010). Pandemic Influenza Influenza occurs in two distinct patterns: pandemic and seasonal. P andemic influenza results from the emergence of a new influenza A virus to which the population possesses little or no immunit y and that can occur at an y time of y ear. Seasonal influenza is usually caused b y influenza A or B viruses and gener ally occurs each y ear during a specific time of the y ear. While outbreaks of influenza ma y be tr aced as far back as 412 B.C.E., the first pandemic , or worldwide epidemic, that clearly fits the description of influenza occurred in 1580. It began in Asia and spread to most of the rest of the world, affecting nearly all of Europe in just six weeks. A t least four influenza pandemics occurred in the nineteenth century , followed b y three more in the twentieth century and one in this century .In the twentieth century , the most dev astating example of a new influenza subt ype emerging in the human population occurred in 1918. The virus contained a subt ype 1 hemagglutinin protein (H1) and a subt ype neur (N1). After the 1918 pandemic, H1N1 v ariants circulated for 39 y ears before being replaced b y an H2N2 virus in 1957. The H2N2 virus w as prevalent for only 11 y ears until 1968, when it w as replaced b y an H3N2 virus (P alese & W ang, 2011). In 2009, a new str ain of H1N1 influenza emerged and caused a worldwide pandemic in which an estimated 280,000 people died.

How Influenza Pandemics Occur\u2014Video (3:23)http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdFCx8jbesQ The Mother of All Pandemics: 1918-1919 The influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 killed more people than the Great W ar, known today as W orld W ar I, at somewhere between 20 and 40 million people. It has been cited as the most dev astating epidemic in recorded world history . More people died of influenza in a single y ear than in the four y ears of the Black Death Bubonic Plague from 1347 to 1351. Known as \"Spanish Flu\" or \"La Grippe, \" the influenza of 1918-1919 w as a global disaster . Molly Billings, 2005 The Influenza Pandemic of 1918 The 1918 influenza pandemic, caused b y an H1N1 influenza subt ype came on suddenly in March of 1918 and spread r apidly throughout the world. In the United States the first reports came from public health officials in Hask ell Count y, Kansas, who reported \"18 cases of influenza of a sev ere type.\" By June the virus had spread from the United States to Europe, where it quickly mo ved from the military to the civilian population. From there, the disease circled the globe\u2014to Asia, Africa, South America, and, back again, to North America. The effect of the influenza epidemic w as so sev ere that the a verage lifespan in the United States was depressed b y 10 y ears (Billings, 2005). The \"Spanish influenza\" of 1918 is estimated to ha ve hit nearly a third of the world' s population. Conditions at the end of W orld W ar I lik ely contributed to the mortalit y (Nicholls, 2006). The 1918 pandemic occurred in three w aves. The first w ave was seen when mild influenza erupted in the late spring and summer of 1918. The second w ave occurred with an outbreak of sev ere influenza in the fall of 1918 and the final w ave hit in the spring of 1919. A ph ysician stationed at Fort Dev ens, outside Boston, reported in late September 1918: How In\u0000uenza P andemics Occur How In\u0000uenza P andemics OccurPatent Medicine LabelThis epidemic started about four weeks ago , and has dev eloped so r apidly that the camp is demor alized and all ordinary work is held up till it has passed. . . .

Few Tools to Fight the Pandemic [Material in this section is from HHS, 2009 unless otherwise cited.] Unfortunately , few tools were a vailable to either prev ent the spread of influenza or treat patients during the 1918-1919 pandemic. A v ariety of remedies were tried, man y of which could be found in local drugstores. Patent medicines (medicines whose ingredients were secret and trademark ed) were still in widespread use in 1918. Among these medicines, Vicks V apo-R ub, atropine capsules (belladonna), and a host of other treatments were especially common. In terms of curing or treating influenza symptoms, these remedies did little to nothing (HHS , 2009).Drug advertisers routinely promised quick and painless cures. Source: National Library of Medicine. People Wearing Masks to Ward Off the Flu Drug advertisers routinely promised quick and painless cures. Source: National Library of Medicine.At the time, most ph ysicians believ ed that influenza w as caused b y a bacillus. Nev ertheless, man y practitioners resorted to treatments deriv ed from older medical theories. These treatments included causing patients to sweat b y wrapping them in blank ets or cupping them to remo ve excess blood (HHS , 2009). P eople were also encour aged to wear masks, which had little effect. Because patients experienced symptoms not tr aditionally associated with influenza, ph ysicians found the disease especially difficult to diagnose in 1918. In the early stages of the pandemic, man y physicians and scientists ev en claimed that influenza patients were suffering from choler a or bubonic plague, not influenza (HHS , 2009). During the fall of 1918, researchers from the Public Health Service began looking for a v accine. They were joined b y researchers in man y other countries. These researchers developed a r ange of v accines that were then tested in communities all o ver the world. None of these v accines proved effectiv e. While researchers placed their hope in vaccines, man y politicians and ph ysicians came to believ e that the spread of the disease could be contained b y quar antines and bans on public gatherings (HHS , 2009). Across the United States, cities and counties began to require or recommend that citiz ens wear gauz e masks. Unfortunately , while masks are highly effectiv e at prev enting diseases that are caused b y bacteria, they are less effectiv e in pro viding protection against vir al diseases. As a result, ev en in communities where the wearing of masks was mandatory , influenza could not be contained. Public officials also sought to limit influenza b y banning spitting in public places and demanding that those who sneez ed co vered their mouths. Red Cross Volunteers in Boston, Massachusetts, 1918 Massachusetts had been drained of physicians and nurses due to calls for military service, and no longer had enough personnel to meet the civilian demand for healthcare during the 1918 flu pandemic. Governor McCall asked every able-bodied person across the state with medical training to offer their aid in fighting the epidemic. Boston Red Cross volunteers assembled gauze influenza masks for use at hard-hit, Cam p Devens in Massachusetts. Source: CD C Historical Image Gallery. Early Symptoms, Recovery, and Relapse During the 1918 pandemic, early symptoms included a temper ature in the r ange of 102\u00b0F to 104\u00b0F . Patients experienced a sore throat, exhaustion, headache, aching limbs, bloodshot ey es, a cough, and occasionally a violent nosebleed. Some also suffered from digestiv e symptoms such as vomiting or diarrhea. Man y patients who experienced these symptoms made a full reco very, only to suffer a relapse. Their temper atures, which had fallen, rose again and they now experienced serious respir atory problems. In some cases, these patients also experienced massiv e pulmonary hemorrhage. After death, pathologists found these victims to ha ve swollen lungs and o versized spleens (HHS , 2009).

Origin of the 1918 Pandemic Strain The 1918 pandemic str ain of influenza is thought to ha ve originated in China in a r are genetic shift of the influenza virus. The recombination of its surface proteins created a virus no vel to almost everyone (Billings, 2005). In the late 1990s, researchers found isolates of the 1918 pandemic virus in the formalin-fix ed, par affin-embedded lungs of an American serviceman. They subsequently retriev ed further samples of this deadly virus from a second soldier , and also from a flu victim exhumed from a frost y mass gr ave in Alaska. The genetic sequencing of the 1918 HIN1 virus w as completed in 2005 (Nicholls, 2006). The sequencing of the 1918 pandemic str ain resulted in a k ey finding. Each segment is more similar to a vian viruses than to segments from an y human str ains. This suggests that the virus did not emerge through reassortment of genetic material but evolved directly via mutation from an a vian virus (Nicholls, 2006).Lung from deceased influenza patient similar to that used to extract RNA from the 1918 killer strain.

An estimated 675,000 people died in the United States. More people died from influenza than died during W orld W ar I.

Seasonal flu gener ally causes less illness because the population has some immunit y left o ver from previous, similar influenza str ains. In the Northern Hemisphere, winter is the time for seasonal influenza, but the exact timing and dur ation of influenza seasons vary. While influenza outbreaks can happen as early as October , activit y usually peaks in January or later . The United States 2017-2018 influenza season w as a high-sev erity season with high lev els of outpatient clinic and ED visits for influenza-lik e illness, high influenza-related hospitalization r ates, and elev ated and geogr aphically widespread influenza activit y across the country for an extended period (Garten et al. , 2018). The \"peak month of flu activit y\" is the month with the highest percentage of respir atory specimens testing positiv e for influenza virus infection during that influenza season. During this 36- year period, flu activit y most often peak ed in F ebruary (15 seasons), followed b y December (7 seasons), March (6 seasons), and January (6 seasons) (CDC, 2018b). Influenza activit y in the United States during the 2018-2019 season (September 30, 2018-Ma y 18, 2019) w as considered to be of moder ate sev erity. Nationally , influenza-lik e illness (ILI) activit y began increasing in No vember 2018, peak ed during mid-F ebruary 2019, and returned to below baseline in mid- April; the season lasted 21 weeks, making it the longest season in 10 y ears (X u et al., 2019). Influenza A viruses predominated, with v ery little influenza B activit y. Two waves of influenza A were notable during this extended season: influenza A(H1N1) viruses from October 2018 to mid- February 2019 and influenza A(H3N2) viruses from F ebruary through Ma y 2019 (see below charts). The number of influenza B viruses reported w as low compared with previous seasons, accounting for only 4% of influenza viruses. Compared with the 2017-2018 influenza season, rates of hospitalization last season were lower for adults, but were similar for children (X u et al. , 2019). Chart shows two waves of flu activity for 2018-2019. Source: CD C. https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6824a3.htm?s_cid=mm6824a3_w Chart shows flu activity for several recent years.

Influenza is a contagious respir atory illness caused b y influenza viruses. It can cause mild to severe illness resulting in hospitalization or ev en death. \"Classic\" influenza is char acteriz ed by the abrupt onset of fev er, myalgia, sore throat, nonproductiv e cough, and headache. The fev er is usually 101\u00b0F to 102\u00b0F and accompanied b y prostr ation (bedridden) (CDC, 2019, 2015PB). The onset of fev er is often so abrupt that the exact hour is recalled b y the patient. My algias mainly affect the back muscles. Cough is believ ed to be a result of tr acheal epithelial destruction. Additional symptoms ma y include runn y nose, headache, substernal chest burning, and ocular symptoms such as ey e pain and sensitivit y to light (CDC, 2019, 2015PB).The incubation period for influenza is usually 2 da ys, but can v ary from 1 to 4 da ys. The sev erity of illness depends on whether the immune system has been exposed to related virus v ariants. Somewhat surprisingly , only about 50% of infected people will dev elop the classic clinical symptoms of influenza (CDC, 2019, 2015PB). Systemic symptoms and fev er usually last from 2 to 3 da ys, rarely more than 5 da ys. They ma y be decreased b y such medications as aspirin* or acetaminophen. R ecovery is usually r apid, but some patients ma y have lingering depression and lack of strength or energy for sev eral weeks (CDC, 2019, 2015PB). *Aspirin should NOT be used for infants, children, or teenagers because they may be at risk for contracting Reye syndrome following an influenza infection. Symptoms of the Flu People who ha ve the flu often feel some or all of these symptoms: Fever* or feeling fev erish, chills Cough Sore throat Runny or stuff y nose Muscle or body aches Headaches Fatigue Vomiting and diarrhea\u2014more common in children than adults * Not everyone with flu will have a fev er. Complications [Material from this section from CDC 2019, CDC 2015, PB]. The most frequent complication associated with influenza is pneumonia, especially secondary bacterial pneumonia (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , or Staphylococcus aureus ). Primary influenza vir al pneumonia is an uncommon complication but has a high fatalit y rate. R eye syndrome is a complication that occurs almost ex clusiv ely in children taking aspirin, primarily in association with influenza B (or v aricella z oster), and presents with sev ere vomiting and confusion, which ma y progress to coma due to swelling of the br ain (CDC, 2019, 2015PB). Other complications can include m yocarditis and worsening of chronic bronchitis and other chronic pulmonary diseases. P eople with congestiv e heart failure ma y have a worsening of the condition triggered b y the flu. Death is reported in less than 1 per 1,000 cases. The majorit y of deaths occur among individuals 65 y ears of age and older (CDC, 2019, 2015PB). If vaccine supply is limited, v accination efforts should focus on:Children 6 months to 4 y ears Adults 50 y ears and older Women who are or will be pregnant during influenza season Residents of nursing homes and other chronic -care facilities Those who are morbidly obese (body -mass index is 40 or greater) Healthcare personnel American Indians and Alaskan Nativ es People with chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardio vascular (ex cept h ypertension), renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus) People who ha ve a weak ened immune system or those that are immunosuppressed (including immunosuppression caused b y medications or HIV) Children 6 months through 18 y ears of age and receiving long-term aspirin ther apy and who therefore might be at risk for experiencing R eye syndrome after influenza virus infection Household contacts and caregiv ers of children y ounger than 5 y ears of age and adults 50 years of age or older , with particular emphasis on v accinating contacts of children aged younger than 6 months Household contacts and caregiv ers of people with medical conditions that put them at higher risk for sev ere complications from influenza (CDC, 2019, 2015PB) Transmission Influenza is primarily a communit y-based infection that is tr ansmitted in households and communit y settings. In humans, influenza is primarily tr ansmitted from person to person via large virus-laden droplets (particles more than 5 microns in diameter) that are gener ated when infected individuals cough or sneez e. These large droplets can then settle on the mucosal surfaces of the upper respir atory tr acts of susceptible people who are nearb y (within 3 feet). Cone-Shaped Dispersion of Sneeze Particles This photograph captures a sneeze in progress, revealing the plume of salivary droplets as they are expelled in a large cone-shaped array from this man's open mouth, thereby dramatically illustrating the reason for covering your mouth when coughing or sneezing, in order to protect others from germ exposure. Source: James Gathany, CDC PHIL, 2009. Transmission can also occur through direct or indirect contact with respir atory secretions, such as when touching surfaces contaminated with influenza virus and then touching the ey es, nose, or mouth. Adults can tr ansmit influenza from the da y before symptom onset to appro ximately 5 da ys after symptoms begin. Children can tr ansmit influenza to others for 10 or more da ys. Health y adults ma y be able to infect others beginning 1 da y before symptoms dev elop and up to 5 to 7 da ys after becoming sick. Some people, especially y oung children and people with weak ened immune systems, might be able to infect others for an ev en longer time. A German study yielded information about how and when influenza spreads within a group of people. In the study in volving 180 participants, evidence of pre-symptomatic shedding of the influenza virus w as observ ed in 30% of samples 1 da y prior to the onset of symptoms. Shedding of virus w as greatest on da ys 1 to 3 of illness (Suess et al. , 2012). Other findings included: Quantit y of virus shed appeared to be the same for asymptomatic and symptomatic infected subjects Those infected with influenza B exhibited the highest vir al shedding load Antivir al ther apy induced a milder clinical course and faster illness resolution but had no effect on vir al shedding Vaccinated and un vaccinated patients did not differ in terms of clinical course and shedding Viable vir al shedding, as measured b y viral culture, did not persist as long as PCR positivit y (Suess et al. , 2012)Watch this fascinating 3-minute video showing how influenza is tr ansmitted and replicated. Flu Attack! How A Virus Invades Your Body (3:39) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpj0emEGShQ The Goal of Universal Vaccination It has been well-established that influenza v accination reduces influenza- associated illness. CDC estimates that tens of thousands of hospitalizations are averted because of v accination each y ear and that v accination prev ents millions of influenza-related illnesses. This is despite that fact that fewer than half of those o ver the age of 6 months are v accinated each y ear. Higher v accination rates almost certainly would prev ent a substantial number of additional cases and hospitalizations. The estimated number of flu illnesses prevented by flu vaccination during the 2017-2018 season: 7 million, about the population of New York City. Flu A ttack! How A Virus Inv ades Y our Body | Krul Flu A ttack! How A Virus Inv ades Y our Body | Krul ......In the United States, goals for impro ving influenza v accination r ates are outlined in Health y People 2020 (see table below). Since 2010 CDC has recommended that all people 6 months of age and older receiv e annual influenza v accination. Despite substantial gains in the number of people vaccinated each y ear, we ha ve yet to come close to the goal of univ ersal influenza v accination. Flu Vaccination Coverage Among Adults by Age Group and Season, United States, 2010-2018 Source: CD C. The College of Ph ysicians of Philadelphia pro vides a fascinating look at the issues associated with vaccines on their History of V accines website (http://www .history ofvaccines.org/). It is well worth the time to look o ver this website and explore \"the w ays in which v accines, to xoids, and passiv e immunization work, how they ha ve been dev eloped, and the role they ha ve played in the impro vement of human health. \" Vaccination Rates Among Adults During the 2017-2018 season, flu v accination co verage among adults w as 37.1%, a decrease of 6.2% from the previous flu season. As in past y ears, people continued to get flu v accinations through the winter and into spring. By the end of the 2017-2018 season, v accine co verage for adults w as appro ximately 8 percentage points higher than early -season estimates. Early-season 2018-19 estimates show an increase in flu v accination co verage among adults compared to the previous season. Howev er, vaccination co verage v aried b y age group and state (CDC, 2018f ). Early and End of Season Flu Vaccination Coverage Among Adults, United States, 2014-November 2018 Source: CD C. Flu vaccination co verage for the 2017-2018 season w as lower for ev ery age group compared to the previous y ear. For all adult age groups, flu v accination r ates were at their lowest lev els compared with the sev en previous seasons. There w as large between-state v ariabilit y in flu coverage among adults, r anging from 29.2% in Louisiana to 46.3% in W est Virginia (CDC, 2018f ). Early findings show an increase in 2018-2019 flu v accinations. Among children aged 6 months-17 years there w as an increase of 6.8 percentage points to 45.6%, compared with the same time period the prior y ear. Flu v accination co verage among adults aged 18 y ears increased b y 6.4 percentage points to 44.9%. Co verage increased for children aged 6 months-12 y ears and among all adult age groups. Interpretation of these results should tak e into account limitations of the surveys, including reliance on self -report of v accination status and decreasing response r ates (CDC, 2018f ). Low v accination r ates ha ve also been noted in Europe, where surv eys from fiv e countries ha ve shown consistently low co verage in the gener al population. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, vaccination campaigns were adopted in man y countries; howev er, low acceptance of a v accine or uptak e rates against pandemic influenza were reported in man y studies (25% among health workers in Beijing, 17% among a French adult population, and 8.9% among pregnant women in Turkey) (W u et al. , 2013). Vaccination Rates Decline as Clinic Day Progresses A retrospectiv e, qualit y-impro vement study of 11 primary actices the Univ ersity of Pennsylv ania Health S ystem from September 1, 2014, to March 31, 2017 yielded interesting results. R esearchers found that influenza v accination r ates significantly declined as the clinic da y progressed. Offering an \"activ e choice\" interv ention in which medical assistants were prompted to mak e decisions on whether to template v accinations orders in patients' electronic health record for clinicians to review w as associated with a significant increase in v accination r ates. Importantly , the activ e choice interv ention w as associated with a significant increase in influenza v accination rates that were similar in magnitude throughout the da y. Source: Kim et al., 2018. Vaccination Rates Among Children Influenza- associated deaths in children (less than 18 y ears) were added as a nationally notifiable condition in 2004. Of particular interest, for children in the United States, influenza v accination rates are fairly high in y oung children but decrease with , analyz ed data from the National Immunization Surv ey\u2014Flu to estimate flu v accination coverage for the U .S. population of children 6 months through 17 y ears during the 2018-2019 flu season. R eceipt of flu v accination w as determined b y parental report. V accination co verage v aried by state and age group . Estimates of flu v accination co verage as of mid-No vember 2018 for children aged 6 months to 17 years w as 45.6%, an increase of 6.8 percentage points compared with the same time period during the previous y ear (X u et al. , 2019). During the 2018-2019 flu season, 116 labor atory-confirmed influenza- associated pediatric deaths (ages 2 months-17 y ears) were reported. T wenty-two percent of the deaths were associated with influenza A(H3N2) infection, 37% with influenza A(H1N1), 34% with an influenza A virus for which no subt yping w as performed, 7% with an influenza B virus, and 1% with an influenza virus for which the t ype w as not determined. The mean age of the pediatric deaths reported this season was 6.1 y ears and 66% of those children died after admission to the hospital. Among the 104 children with a known medical history , 51% had at least one underlying medical condition recogniz ed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Pr actices (ACIP) as placing them at high risk for influenza-related complications (X u et al. , 2019).Among the 89 children who were eligible for influenza v accination (age 6 months at date of onset) and for whom v accination status w as known, 34% had receiv ed at least 1 dose of influenza vaccine before illness onset (25 of the children were fully v accinated according to 2018 ACIP recommendations, and fiv e had receiv ed 1 of 2 recommended doses) (X u et al. , 2019). Early and End of Season Flu Vaccination Coverage Among Children, United States, 2014-November 2018 Source: CD C. Vaccination Rates Among Healthcare Workers The o verall influenza v accination co verage estimate among healthcare personnel w as 78.4% during the 2017-2018 influenza season, a 15% increase since the 2010-2011 season, but similar to coverage during the previous four seasons. As in past seasons, the highest co verage w as associated with workplace v accination requirements. R eported co verage w as consistently higher among healthcare personnel working in hospital settings than among those working in other settings; healthcare personnel working in hospital settings were also the most lik ely to report workplace v accination requirements (Black et al. , 2018). Influenza v accination co verage w as higher among healthcare personnel with v accination a vailable at or promoted in their workplace than among those without an y type of emplo yer promotion of vaccination; howev er, coverage achiev ed through v accine a vailabilit y and promotion w as still suboptimal in the absence of requirements. Neither v accination co verage nor prev alence of emplo yer vaccination requirements or promotion differed in the 2017-2018 season compared with the previous season, despite the sev erity of the 2017-2018 influenza season (Black et al. , 2018). Influenza v accination co verage among healthcare personnel working in long-term care settings, the majorit y of whom work as assistants and aides, continues to be consistently lower than that among healthcare personnel working in all other healthcare settings. Influenza v accination among healthcare personnel in long-term care settings is especially important because influenza v accine efficacy is gener ally lowest among elders, who are at increased risk for sev ere disease (Black et al., 2018).In contr ast to healthcare personnel working in hospitals, a much lower proportion of surv ey respondents working in long-term care settings reported ha ving a requirement for v accination, and 23.5% reported that their emplo yer did not require, mak e available on-site at no cost, or promote vaccination in an y way. Implementing workplace v accination progr ams that ha ve been successful in increasing co verage in hospital settings, including v accination requirements, could increase coverage in long-term care and other settings with historically lower v accination co verage (Black et al., 2018). Did You Know . . . Workplace v accination progr ams that ha ve been successful in increasing coverage in hospital settings could be implemented in long-term care and other settings with lower v accination co verage. Emplo yers can use the long-term care web-based toolkit developed b y CDC and the National V accine Progr am Office to access resources, str ategies, and educational materials for increasing influenza v accination among healthcare personnel in long-term care settings (Black et al. , 2017). These low r ates are certainly at least partly related to high staff turno ver; it is not uncommon for a long-term facilit y's staff to turn o ver completely ev ery few y ears. Newly hired managers ma y not adhere to existing policies related to v accinations, or they ma y decide to discard such policies and implement new ones (AHRQ , 2014). Source: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 2018. Vaccination Rates by Healthcare Occupation [Material in this section from Black et a., 2017 unless otherwise cited.] During the 2016-2017 season (earliest a vailable statistics), flu v accination co verage w as highest among ph ysicians (95.8%) and lowest among assistants and aides (69.1%), and highest o verall among healthcare personnel who were required b y their emplo yer to be v accinated (96.7%).Among healthcare personnel working in settings where v accination w as neither required, promoted, nor offered onsite, v accination co verage continued to be low (45.8%). An increased percentage of healthcare personnel reporting a v accination requirement or onsite v accination availabilit y compared with earlier influenza seasons might ha ve contributed to the o verall increase in vaccination co verage during the past sev en influenza seasons. Vaccination Rates by Healthcare Setting Not surprisingly , vaccination r ates among healthcare pro viders v ary by work setting. During the 2016-2017 season, v accination co verage continued to be higher among healthcare personnel working in hospitals (92.3%) and lower among healthcare personnel working in ambulatory (76.1%) and long-term care settings (68%). Coverage w as highest among ph ysicians, nurse pr actitioners/ph ysician assistants, nurses, pharmacists, and healthcare personnel working in hospital settings. Co verage w as lowest among assistants and aides and personnel working in long-term care settings. Emplo yer vaccination requirements and offering v accination at the workplace at no cost were associated with higher vaccination co verage. Why is it so important to increase v accination r ates among healthcare personnel? Because of their close pro ximity to sick patients, healthcare pro viders are more lik ely to get influenza and to pass it on , with more significant consequences than for an y other group of workers. P aradoxically , when a healthcare pro vider gets sick, sev eral studies ha ve shown that more than 75% continue to work despite being infected with influenza (Riphagen-Dalhuisen et al. , 2013). A recent study conducted among nursing home work ers in Fr ance suggest low r ates of influenza vaccination there as well. Management and working en vironment appear to pla y a strong role and the authors suggest that: \"T o overcome v accine 'hesitancy ,' specific communication tools ma y be required to be adapted to the v arious NH professionals to impro ve influenza prev ention\" (Elias et al., 2017). Refusing or Accep ting the Flu Vaccine Each y ear, we must decide whether to get v accinated against the flu. Man y of us get the v accine without a second thought, while a significant percentage of Americans either choose not to get vaccinated or simply nev er get around to it. Vaccine HesitancyFor man y individuals, the health benefits associated with v accination is not a sufficient reason to embrace v accination wholeheartedly . They doubt the benefits of v accines, worry o ver their safet y, and question the need for them, an attitude referred to as vaccine hesitancy . An attitude of hesitancy differs from an action of v accine refusal. Ev en those who are v accinated can harbor hesitancy tow ard certain aspects of v accination (Y aqub et al. , 2014). While co verage rates are helpful for identif ying those who reject, it does little to help us understand hesitant attitudes, their origins, and how to change them. Maintaining high co verage rates helps to ensure that v accination benefits are deliv ered widely , but the v ery act of deliv ering wide-scale v accination can mak e vaccines \"victims of their own success. \" As the r avages of disease become less familiar to people, it ma y become more challenging to articulate the desir ability of vaccination (Y aqub et al. , 2014). Reasons for Refusing the Flu Vaccine It is certainly reasonable to ask wh y so man y people, both in and out of healthcare, decide not to get vaccinated against influenza each y ear. Studies that in vestigate wh y a segment of the population does not accept v accination ha ve highlighted lack of knowledge, misperceptions, and distrust of v accines. Ironically , another reason cited is a low perceiv ed risk because the incidence has declined as a result of v accination progr ams (Herz og et al. , 2013). Surveys in Europe and the United States ha ve found that low seasonal v accination co verage rates are influenced b y inadequate (or no) recommendation b y gener al practitioners, poor public awareness of influenza and influenza v accines, a lack of proactiv e reminder systems, and a fear of needles (Blank et al. , 2012). Examining misconceptions about v accination pro vides some context about wh y man y people forgo the influenza v accine each y ear: Fear that the immune system will be \"o verloaded\" b y vaccines, especially in children. The belief that man y common diseases ha ve disappeared and it is no longer necessary to vaccinate against them. The belief that more v accinated than un vaccinated people get sick. The belief that h ygiene and better nutrition are responsible for the reduction in disease r ates, not vaccination. The belief that natur al immunit y is better than v accine- acquired immunit y. (The College of Physicians of Philadelphia, 2016) When looking at the reasons wh y a significant percentage of healthcare pro viders in the United States sa y they do not intend to get a seasonal flu v accine, the most commonly reported reason was that they do not think the flu vaccine works . Other reasons included thinking they do not need a flu v accine, fear of getting sick, fear of side effects from v accination, being allergic to the vaccine, and thinking that flu v accination is not good for y ou. Main Reason Reported for Not Getting the Flu Vaccine Among Healthcare Personnel Not Planning to Get One in 2016- 2017 Internet Panel Survey, November 2016, USA Source: CD C, 2016. Recently , researchers from the European Centre for Disease Prev ention and Control (ECDC) analyz ed the results of a study conducted b y vaccine producers, which look ed at the costs and benefits of influenza v accination. Cautioning that the data on v accine co verage, disease burden, and health costs are imprecise, the analysts nev ertheless agreed that it is important to understand the reasons for low v accine co verage in the 27 European countries included in the study (Ciancio & Rezza, 2014). The reasons for low v accine co verage echo man y of the findings in earlier studies: Reasons for Accepting the Flu Vaccine When I first started work as a nurse, I nev er got a flu shot. If I got the flu, I went to work ev en though I w as sick. One y ear I got the flu shot on a Frida y morning and w as sick as a dog b y the ev ening. Now I know that I already had the flu when I got the shot \u2014 back then I blamed it on the v accine and didn' t get a shot for sev eral more y ears. One year I got the flu, missed sev eral days of work, and coughed m y lungs out for almost two weeks. After that I thought, this is ridiculous, the flu v accine will stop all of this. It w as a no-br ainer. Now I get a shot ev ery year. ER Nurse, California, 2018Vaccine hesitancy in healthcare work ers and in the population 1. Lack of confidence in v accine effectiv eness and safet y 2. Complex v accine recommendations 3. Short v accine deliv ery window 4. Lack of resources5.There are man y good reasons for healthcare work ers to get a flu v accine, not least of which is they are less lik ely to become ill themselv es and much less lik ely to pass the virus on to their patients and families . Among healthcare personnel who receiv ed the flu v accine in 2016, protecting themselv es from flu w as the most common reason reported for receiving the flu vaccination. Emplo yer requirement for flu v accination w as the second most commonly reported reason wh y vaccinated healthcare pro viders decided to get the flu v accination (CDC, 2016). Main Reason Reported for Getting the Flu Vaccine Among Healthcare Personnel (n=1,378) Internet Panel Survey, November 2016, USA Source: CD C, 2016. During the 2009-2010 H1N1 influenza pandemic in Fr ance, German y, and Mexico , the most common reason giv en to be v accinated for A/H1N1 pandemic influenza w as a ph ysician' s advice or recommendation. In the United States, media adv ertising w as the most important motiv ating factor , although a ph ysician' s advice w as nearly as important (Blank et al. , 2012). Influenza Vaccination Programs Influenza v accination progr ams in healthcare facilities are most successful when they are multifaceted. Successful progr ams focus on the following: Full, visible leadership support with the expectation for v accination fully and clearly communicated to all healthcare personnel Provision of adequate resources and support for the healthcare personnel v accination progr am Inclusion of all pr actices necessary to reduce the spread of influenza in healthcare settings, including patient isolation, use of personal protectiv e equipment, applying hand and respir atory h ygiene and cough etiquette, and restriction of ill visitors and ill healthcare personnel (NV AC, 2013) An interactive quiz to test your flu knowledge: http://www.cdc.gov/flu/freeresources/wIn one inno vative progr am initiated b y the Univ ersity of Pittsburgh Medical Center , 14 long-term care facilities ceded control of v accination-related policies and processes to a regional pharmacy . The facilities work ed collabor atively with the pharmacy to implement and enforce standardiz ed policies and processes to boost influenza v accination r ates among facilit y work ers. This policy change significantly increased work er vaccination r ates in participating facilities, enabling all facilities to reach the Health y People 2010 goal of v accinating 60% of work ers in long-term care settings and sev eral facilities to ex ceed the Health y People 2020 goal of v accinating 90% (AHRQ , 2014). When receiving the influenza v accine is a condition for emplo yment, v accination r ates can approach 100%. During 2010-2011 influenza season, CDC found that appro ximately 13% of healthcare personnel reported that their emplo yers required influenza v accination as a condition of emplo yment. Among this group , vaccination co verage w as 98.1%, compared with 58.3% among those without an emplo yer requirement (NV AC, 2013). A national surv ey of acute care hospitals found that 55.6% of the hospitals surv eyed had implemented an institutional requirement, but that v accination co verage rates increased most significantly in hospitals that also enforced consequences for v accine refusal. Consequences ranged in sev erity from mandatory masking to emplo yee termination for noncompliance (NV AC, 2013). Diagnosis and Treatment of Influenza During the influenza season, when flu is circulating within the communit y, most people who get the flu will experience self -limiting symptoms. Howev er, severe disease can occur in older adults, in those with underlying medical conditions, and in the v ery young. Appropriate treatment of patients with respir atory illness depends on accur ate and timely diagnosis. The diagnosis of influenza is usually suspected on the basis of char acteristic clinical findings, particularly if influenza has been reported in the communit y (CDC, 2019, 2015PB). Early diagnosis of influenza can reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics and pro vide the option of using antivir al ther apy. Howev er, because certain bacterial infections can produce symptoms similar to influenza, bacterial infections should be considered and appropriately treated, if suspected. In addition, bacterial infections can occur as a complication of influenza. The Infectious Disease Societ y of America states that antivir al treatment should start as soon as possible for adults and children with documented or suspected influenza, irrespectiv e of influenza v accination history , who meetthe following criteria (Uy eki et al. , 2018): Persons of any age who are hospitaliz ed with influenza, regardless of dur ation of illness. Outpatients of any age with sev ere or progressiv e illness, regardless of the dur ation of illness. Outpatients with chronic medical conditions and immunocompromised patients. Children younger than 2 y ears and adults 65 y ears. Pregnant women and those within 2 weeks postpartum. Antivir al treatment should be considered for adults and children who are not at high risk of influenza complications, with documented or suspected influenza, irrespectiv e of influenza vaccination history , who are Outpatients with up to 2 da ys illness onset before presentation. Symptomatic household contacts of persons at high risk of dev eloping complications from influenza, especially those who are sev erely immunocompromised. Symptomatic healthcare pro viders of patients at high risk of dev eloping complications from influenza, especially those who are sev erely immunocompromised (Uy eki et al., 2018) Although summer influenza activit y in the United States t ypically is low , influenza cases and outbreaks can occur during summer months. Clinicians should remain vigilant in considering influenza in the differential diagnosis of summer respir atory illnesses. T esting for seasonal influenza viruses and monitoring for no vel influenza A virus infections should continue y ear-round (Xu et al. , 2019). Healthcare pro viders also are reminded to consider no vel influenza virus infections in persons with influenza-lik e illness and swine or poultry exposure or with sev ere acute respir atory infection after travel to areas where a vian influenza viruses ha ve been detected. Pro viders should alert the local public health department if no vel influenza virus infection is suspected. Influenza should be suspected in ill tr avelers returning from countries with ongoing influenza activit y. Suspected v ariant influenza infections should be referred to state public health departments for testing (X u et al. , 2019). Annual influenza v accination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months and remains the most effectiv e way to prev ent influenza illness. T reatment as soon as possible with influenza antivir al medications is recommended for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who ha ve severe, complicated, or progressiv e illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at high risk for influenza- associated complications, including adults 65 y ears. Pro viders should not rely on less sensitiv e assa ys such as r apid antigen detection influenza diagnostic tests to inform treatment decisions. (X u et al. , 2019). Laboratory DiagnosisThe diagnosis of influenza is usually suspected on the basis of char acteristic clinical findings, particularly if influenza has been reported in the communit y. Virus can be isolated from throat and nasopharyngeal sw abs obtained within 3 da ys of onset of illness. Culture is performed b y inoculation of chick embry os or certain cell cultures that support vir al replication. A minimum of 48 hours is required to demonstr ate virus, and 1 to 2 additional da ys to identif y the virus t ype. Culture is helpful in defining the etiology of local epidemics, but not in individual case management (CDC, 2019, 2015PB). Serologic confirmation of influenza requires demonstr ation of a significant rise in influenza immunoglobulin G (IgG). The acute-phase specimen should be tak en less than 5 da ys from onset, and a con valescent specimen tak en 10 to 21 da ys (prefer ably 21 da ys) following onset. Complement fixation (CF) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) are the serologic tests most commonly used. The k ey test is HI, which depends on the abilit y of the virus to agglutinate erythrocytes and inhibition of this process b y specific antibody . Diagnosis requires at least a fourfold rise in antibody titer (CDC, 2019, 2015PB). Rapid diagnostic testing for influenza antigen is a vailable, but because these tests fail to detect many patients with influenza, CDC recommends antivir al treatment with oseltamivir or zanamivir as early as possible for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who ha ve severe, complicated, or progressiv e illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at greater risk for serious influenza-related complications (CDC, 2019PB). Antiviral Agents Influenza antivir al prescription drugs can be used to treat influenza or to prev ent influenza. In the United States, fiv e antivir al agents are licensed for prev enting or treating influenza. A sixth \"prodrug\" (X oflusa) w as appro ved by the FDA on October 24, 2018: Neuraminidase Inhibitors Adamantanes Influenza virus replication inhibitor Antivir al agents for influenza are an adjunct to v accine and are not a substitute for v accine. Vaccination remains the principal means for prev enting influenza-related morbidit y and mortalit y (CDC, 2019, 2015PB).Inhaled Z anamivir (tr ade name R elenza) 1. Oral oseltamivir (a vailable as a generic v ersion or under the tr ade name T amiflu) 2. Intravenous P eramivir (tr 6.Neuraminidase Inhibitors Three chemically -related antivir al medications known as neur aminidase inhibitors block the vir al neuraminidase enzyme and ha ve activit y against both influenza A and B viruses: or al oseltamivir phosphate (available as a generic v ersion or under the tr ade name T amiflu), inhaled zanamivir (trade name R elenza), and Amantadine and rimantadine are antivir al drugs in a class of medications known as adamantanes. These medications are activ e against influenza A viruses, but not influenza B viruses (CDC, 2019a). As in recent past seasons, there continues to be high lev els of resistance (>99%) to adamantanes among circulating influenza A(H3N2) and influenza A(H1N1) viruses. Therefore, amantadine and rimantadine are not recommended for antivir al treatment or chemoproph ylaxis of currently circulating influenza A viruses (CDC, 2019a). Xoflusa The newest antivir al is or al baloxavir marboxil (trade name X oflusa), which is activ e against both influenza A and B viruses, but has a different mechanism of action than neur aminidase inhibitors. Balo xavir is an endonuclease inhibitor that interferes with vir al RNA tr anscription and blocks virus replication (CDC, 2019r). Baloxavir was appro ved by the FDA in October of 2018. It is not recommended for pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, outpatients with complicated or progressiv e illness, or hospitaliz ed patients, because there is no information about its use in these patients (CDC, 2019a). FDA Ap proved Antivirals for 2019-2020 There are four influenza antivir al medications appro ved by the U .S. Food and Drug Administr ation (FDA) for use in the United States during the (2019-2020) influenza season: Oseltamivir phosphate (a vailable as a generic v ersion or under the tr ade name Tamiflu , is available as a pill or liquid suspension. Both are FDA appro ved for early treatment of flu in people 14 da ys and older . Zanamivir (trade name Relenza ) is a powder that is inhaled and appro ved for early treatment of flu in people 7 years and older . It is not recommended for people with breathing problems like asthma or COPD . Peramivir (trade name Rapivab ) is giv en b y a health care pro vider and appro ved for early treatment of flu in people 2 y ears and older . Baloxavir marbo xil (tr ade name Xoflusa ) is a pill giv en as a single dose b y mouth that is appro ved for early treatment of flu in people 12 y ears and older (CDC, 2019r).Duration of treatment with antivir al drugs v aries depending on the antivir al drug prescribed. Oseltamivir and zanamivir are usually prescribed to be tak en twice daily for 5 da ys, although people hospitaliz ed with flu ma y need antivir al treatment for longer than 5 da ys. Peramivir is giv en one time intr avenously o ver a period of 15 to 30 minutes. Balo xavir is giv en as a single or al dose (CDC, 2019a). Infection Control and Prevention Traditionally , influenza viruses ha ve been thought to spread from person to person primarily through large-particle respir atory droplet tr ansmission (eg, when an infected person coughs or sneez es near a susceptible person). T ransmission via large-particle droplets requires close contact between source and recipient persons, because droplets gener ally tr avel only short distances (appro ximately 6 feet or less) through the air . Indirect contact tr ansmission via hand tr ansfer of influenza virus from virus-contaminated surfaces or objects to mucosal surfaces of the face (eg, nose, mouth) ma y also occur (CDC, 2018e). Airborne tr ansmission via small particle aerosols in the vicinit y of the infectious individual ma y also occur; howev er, the relativ e contribution of the different modes of influenza tr ansmission is unclear . Airborne tr ansmission o ver longer distances, such as from one patient room to another , has not been documented and is thought not to occur . All respir atory secretions and bodily fluids, including diarrheal stools, of patients with influenza are considered to be potentially infectious; howev er, the risk ma y vary by strain. Detection of influenza virus in blood or stool in influenza infected patients is v ery uncommon (CDC, 2018e). In Healthcare Settings Healthcare settings include, but are not limited to , acute-care hospitals; long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities; ph ysicians' offices; urgent -care centers, outpatient clinics; and home healthcare (CDC, 2018e). Preventing tr ansmission of influenza within a healthcare setting requires a multi-faceted approach. Spread of influenza virus can occur among patients, healthcare personnel, and visitors; in addition, healthcare personnel ma y acquire influenza from people in their household or communit y(CDC, 2018e). Core infection prev ention accine Implement respir atory h ygiene and cough etiquette Appropriate management of ill healthcare personnel Adherence to infection control precautions for all patient -care activities and aerosol- gener ating procedures Implementation of en vironmental and engineering infection control measures (CDC, 2018e).Successful implementation of man y, if not all, of these str ategies is dependent on the presence of clear administr ative policies and organizational leadership that promote and facilitate adherence to these recommendations among the v arious people within the healthcare setting, including patients, visitors, and healthcare personnel (CDC, 2018e). In Long-Term Care Facilities Long-term care facilities are institutions, such as nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities, which pro vide healthcare to people (including children) who are unable to manage independently in the communit y. This care ma y represent custodial or chronic care management or short -term rehabilitativ e services (CDC, 2019i). Influenza can be introduced into a long-term care facilit y by newly admitted residents, healthcare workers, or visitors. Spread of influenza can occur between and among residents, healthcare providers, and visitors. R esidents of long-term care facilities can experience sev ere and fatal illness during influenza outbreaks (CDC, 2019i). As in an y healthcare setting, k ey prev ention str ategies in long-term care settings all residents should receiv e trivalent inactiv ated influenza v accine (TIV) annually before influenza season. In the majorit y of seasons, TIV will become a vailable to long-term care facilities beginning in September , and influenza v accination should begin as soon as v accine is a vailable. Informed consent is required to implement a standing order for v accination, but this does not necessarily mean a signed consent must be present (CDC, 2019i). Since October 2005 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has required nursing homes participating in Medicare and Medicaid progr ams to offer all residents influenza and pneumococcal v accines and to document the results. Each resident is to be v accinated unless contraindicated medically , the resident or legal representativ e refuses v accination, or the v accine is not a vailable (CDC, 2019). Even if it is not influenza season, influenza testing should occur when an y resident of a long-term care facilit y has signs and symptoms that could be due to influenza, and especially when two residents or more dev elop respir atory illness within 72 hours of each other . Because of the high risk of morbidit y and mortalit y in older adults, daily activ e surv eillance is recommended for respir atory illness among ill residents, healthcare personnel, and visitors to the facilit y (CDC, 2019i).Annual v accination 1. Testing 2. Infection control3. Antivir 4. Antivir al chemoproph ylaxis (CDC, 2019i) 5.If influenza is already present in a long-term care facilit y, residents who are symptomatic should stay in their own rooms as much as possible. They should be restricted from participation in common activities and should ha ve meals serv ed in their rooms. If an outbreak is widespread, large-group activities should be limited and all meals should be offered in resident rooms. New admissions or tr ansfers to w ards with symptomatic residents should be a voided (CDC, 2019i). A posted notice should alert visitors to the presence of influenza in a facilit y. The spread of influenza can be reduced b y restricting visitation and ex cluding ill people from visiting the facilit y during an outbreak. During communit y outbreaks of influenza, children should also be restricted from visiting residents (CDC, 2019i). Healthcare personnel with respir atory symptoms should be monitored and those with influenza- like symptoms should sta y home until at least 24 hours after they no longer ha ve a fev er (CDC, 2019i). Influenza Prevention Recommendations for Long-Term Care Facilities Residents with signs and symptoms of influenza-lik e illness should be tested for influenza. Residents being tested for other respir atory pathogens during non-influenza season periods should also be tested for influenza. Facilities should implement daily activ e surv eillance for respir atory illness among ill residents, healthcare personnel, and visitors to the facilit y. Standard and Droplet Precautions should be used for all residents with suspected or confirmed influenza. Influenza antivir al treatment and chemoproph ylaxis should be administered to residents and healthcare personnel according to current recommendations. T reatment should not w ait for labor atory confirmation of influenza. Residents in the entire long-term care facilit y (not just currently impacted w ards) should receiv e antivir al chemoproph ylaxis as soon as an influenza outbreak is determined. Antivir al chemoproph ylaxis can be considered or offered to un vaccinated personnel who provide care to people at high risk of complications. Drug-resistant viruses are a possibilit y and should be considered.

Source: Wi kimedia Commons.Influenza outbreaks in hospitals and long-term care facilities ha ve been attributed to low influenza vaccination co verage among healthcare personnel. Higher v accination lev els among healthcare personnel ha ve been associated with a lower risk of healthcare facilit y-associated influenza cases (CDC, 2019i). Current ACIP Influenza Recommendations To access the current (2019-2020) ACIP influenza recommendations please see: Prevention and Control of Seasonal Influenza with Vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, United States, 2019-2020 Influenza Season Source: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/rr/rr6803a1.htm. Influenz a Vaccines A vaccine is a substance (an antigen) made from a virus or bacterium that triggers the body' s immune system to dev elop antibodies. Substances are sometimes added to a v accine to gener ate a stronger immune response so that less v accine is needed for the body to recogniz e and fight the antigen. Influenza v accines cause antibodies to dev elop about 2 weeks after v accination. Influenza v accines are a vailable in an inactiv form ated influenza v accines have been a vailable since the 1940s and ha ve traditionally been administered intr amuscularly or intr adermally . Live attenuated vaccine w as appro ved for use in the United States in 2003. Liv e attenuated influenza v accines contain a v ersion of the living microbe that has been weak ened in the lab so it cannot cause disease. Inactiv ated v accines are produced b y killing the disease-causing microbe in a virus or bacteria with chemicals, heat, or r adiation. Inactiv ated v accines are more stable and safer than liv e vaccines because the dead microbes cannot mutate back to their disease- causing state. Howev er, most inactiv ated v accines stimulate a weaker immune system response than do liv e vaccines (NAIAD , 2019b). Influenza Vaccine Key Points Inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV)Trivalent, quadrivalent Available since the 1940s Intramuscular or intradermal Live attenuated vaccine (LAIV)Quadrivalent Intranasal Influenza Vaccine Production Technologies In late F ebruary to early March\u2014 well before the new flu season begins\u2014 an FDA advisory committee reviews data about which flu viruses ha ve caused disease in the past y ear, how the viruses are changing, and disease trends, so they can recommend the three or four flu str ains to include in the triv alent and quadriv alent influenza v accines for the United States in the upcoming flu season (FDA, 2019a). There are three different influenza v accine production technologies appro ved by the FDA: Egg-based flu v accine Cell-based flu v accine Recombinant flu v accine (2018c) The most common w ay that flu v accines are made is using an egg-based manufacturing process that has been used for more than 70 y ears. Egg-based v accine manufacturing is used to mak e both inactiv ated (killed) v accine used in the flu shot and liv e attenuated (weak ened) v accine used , of flu v accines w as appro ved by the FDA in 2012. Until recently , this production process began with egg-grown CVVs (candidate v accine viruses). Howev er, on A ugust 31, 2016, the FDA issued an appro val for Seqirus , the sole FDA -appro ved cell-based flu v accine manufacturer in the United States, to use CVVs that are grown in animal cells. Cell culture technology has the potential for a faster start -up of the flu v accine manufacturing process (NIAID , 2019b). Recombinant technology for flu v accines w as appro ved for the U .S. mark et in 2013. It does not require an egg-grown v accine virus and can be produced in a shorter amount of time than either egg-grown or cell-grown v accine viruses.Manufacturers using recombinant technology isolate a certain gene (the hemagglutinin or HA gene) from a natur ally occurring (wild t ype) recommended v accine virus. This HA gene is combined with portions of another virus that grows well in insect cells. It is then mix ed with insect cells and allowed to replicate. The flu HA protein is then harv ested from these cells and purified. Currently , recombinant flu v accine is the only 100% egg-free v accine on the U .S. mark et (CDC, 2018c). The only influenza v accine produced using recombinant technology is Flublok Quadrivalent . It has been licensed b y the FDA for use in adults 18 y ears and older (CDC, 2018). Trivalent Inactivated Vaccines (IIV3) For years, flu v accines were designed to protect against three different flu viruses (triv alent vaccines). Standard dose triv alent v accines include an influenza A (H1N1) virus, an influenza A (H3N2) virus and one influenza B virus. Because there are two distinct lineages of influenza B viruses\u2014 Victoria and Y amagata\u2014immunization against a single influenza B virus pro vides only limited cross protection against str ains in the other lineage. The standard dose triv alent shot (IIV3), is manufactured using virus grown in eggs. This shot (Afluria) can be giv en either with a needle (for people aged 5 y ears and older) or with a jet injector (or people aged 18 through 64 y ears only) (CDC, 2019p). A three-component (triv Fluz one High-Dose is licensed specifically for people 65 y ears and older . Fluz one High-Dose contains four times the antigen of standard-dose inactiv ated influenza v accines. The higher dose of antigen in the v accine is intended to giv e older people a better immune response, and therefore, better protection against flu (CDC, 2019e). The high-dose v accine has been appro ved for use in the United States since 2009. R esults of a clinical trial of more than 30,000 participants showed that adults 65 y ears and older who receiv ed the high-dose v accine had 24% fewer influenza infections compared to those who receiv ed the standard dose flu v accine The intr adermal flu v accine is a shot that is injected into the skin instead of the muscle. The intr adermal shot uses a much smaller needle than the regular flu shot, and it requires less antigen to be as effectiv e as the regular flu shot. It ma y be used in adults 18 to 64 years of age. Source: FDA, 2019b. A triv alent flu shot made with adjuv ant (Fluad ) is appro ved for people 65 y ears and older . An adjuv ant is an ingredient added to a v accine to create a stronger immune response. The v accine, FLUAD (allV3), w as licensed in No vember 2015 and became a vailable during the 2016-2017 flu season. It contains MF59 adjuv ant, an oil-in- water emulsion of squalene oil. FLU AD is the first seasonal flu v accine with adjuv ant mark eted in the United States. Squalene, a natur ally occurring substance found in humans, animals, and plants, is highly purified for the v accine manufacturing process (CDC, 2019b). Quadrivalent Vaccines The quadriv alent flu v accine is designed to protect against four different flu viruses: two influenza A viruses and two influenza B viruses. Adding another B virus to the v accine aims to giv e broader protection against circulating flu viruses (CDC, 2019n). Standard-dose quadriv alent flu shots are manufactured using virus These include Different flu shots are appro ved for different age groups. There is a quadriv alent flu shot that can be giv en to children as y oung as 6 months of age. Other quadriv alent flu shots are appro ved for people 3 y ears and older (CDC, 2019n). Most flu shots are giv en in the arm muscle with a needle. One quadriv alent flu shot (Afluria Quadriv alent) can be giv en either with a needle (for people aged 5 y ears and older) or with a jet injector (for people aged 18 through 64 y ears only) (CDC, 2019b). A quadriv alent cell-based flu shot (Flucelv ax Quadriv alent) containing virus grown in cell culture, is appro ved for people 4 y ears and older . A recombinant quadriv alent flu shot (Flublok Quadriv alent) is appro ved for people 18 y ears and older (CDC, 2019). For more information on appro ved flu v accines for the 2019-2020 flu season, as well as age indications for each v accine, please see CDC' s Table, U.S. Influenza Vaccine Products for the 2019-2020) Season. https://www .cdc.go v/flu/professionals/v accines.htm 2018 Flublok Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4) In 2013 the U .S. Food and Drug Administr ation (FDA) announced its appro val of Flublok, ated influenza v accine for the prev ention of seasonal influenza in people 18 years and older . Flublok' s manufacturing process has the potential for faster startup of v accine manufacturing, which can be useful in the ev ent of a pandemic or v accine supply shortage, mainly because it is not dependent on an egg supply or limited b y the selection of v accine viruses that are adapted for growth in eggs. Also , this v accine is suitable for v accinating people with egg allergies because it is not made using eggs. Flublok Quadriv alent (RIV4) is a vailable for the 2019-2020 influenza season. RIV4 is indicated for persons aged 18 y ears. RIV4 is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses; therefore, similarly to IIVs, no shedding of v accine virus will occur . RIV4 is produced without the use of eggs, and thus is egg-free. No preference is expressed for RIV4 v ersus IIVs within specified indications. RIV4 is administered b y intr amuscular injection (Grohsk opf et al. , 2018), CDC, 2019o). Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) Live attenuated influenza v accine (LAIV) w as appro ved for use in the United States in 2003. LAIV contains the same influenza viruses as inactiv ated influenza v accines. It does not contain thimerosal or an y other preserv ative. LAIV is pro vided in a single-dose unit; half of the is spr ayed into each nostril. The nasal accine contains attenuated (weak ened) liv e viruses that will not cause influenza illness. The weak ened viruses are cold- adapted, which means they are designed to only multiply at the cooler temper atures found within the nose. The viruses cannot infect the lungs or other areas where w armer temper atures exist. During previous flu seasons (2016-2017 and 2017-2018), the Advisory Committee on Immunization Pr actices (ACIP) recommended that LAIV4 not be used because of concerns about low effectiv eness against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09-lik e viruses circulating in the United States during the 2013-2014 and 2015-2016 seasons (Grohsk opf et al. , 2018). For the 2019-2020 flu season, ACIP recommends an y influenza v accine that is appropriate for the recipient 's age and health status, including inactiv ated influenza v accine (IIV), recombinant nasal spr ay influenza v accine (LAIV4), with no preference expressed for an y one v accine o ver another (CDC, 2019l). The nasal spr ay is appro ved for use in non-pregnant individuals, 2 y ears through 49 y ears of age. People with some medical conditions should not receiv e the nasal spr ay flu v accine (CDC, 2019l). For more information, click here. ImmunityImmunit y following administr ation of inactiv ated influenza v accine is less than 1 y ear, due to waning of v accine-induced antibodies and antigenic drift of circulating influenza viruses. Influenza vaccine efficacy v aries b y the similarit y of the v accine str ain to circulating str ains and the age and health of the recipient. CDC conducts studies each y ear to determine how well the influenza v accine protects against flu illness. While v accine effectiv eness (VE) can v ary, recent studies show that flu v accination reduces the risk of flu illness b y between 40% and 60% among the o verall population during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are well-matched to the flu v accine. In gener al, current flu v accines tend to work better against influenza B and influenza A(H1N1) viruses and offer lower protection against influenza A(H3N2) viruses (CDC, 2018f ). Antibody against one influenza virus t ype or subt ype confers limited or no protection against another t ype or subt ype. Frequent emergence of antigenic v ariants through antigenic drift is the virologic basis for seasonal epidemics and necessitates consider ation for adjustment of v accine viruses each season (Grohsk opf et al. , 2018). Pregnant Women and Neonates Both ACIP and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommend that women who are or will be pregnant during influenza season receiv e an inactivated influenza vaccine as soon as it is a vailable. Because pregnant women are at high risk of serious flu complications, CDC recommends influenza vaccination during any trimester of pregnancy (CDC, 2019c). Influenza is more lik ely to cause sev ere illness in pregnant women than in women who are not pregnant, particularly during the second and third trimesters. Changes in the immune system, heart, and lungs during pregnancy mak e pregnant women (and women up to 2 weeks postpartum) more prone to sev ere illness from flu, including illness resulting in hospitalization. Flu also ma y be harmful for a pregnant woman' s dev eloping bab y. A common flu symptom is fev er, which ma y be associated with neur al tube defects and other adv erse outcomes for a dev eloping baby (CDC, 2019c). Numerous studies ha ve shown that flu v accination protects pregnant women during and after pregnancy and also protects babies from flu infection for sev eral months after birth, before the child is old enough to be v accinated (the mother passes antibodies on to the dev eloping bab y during her pregnancy) (CDC, 2019c). Millions of flu v accines ha ve been giv en for decades, including to pregnant women. Numerous studies, including clinical trials and observ ational studies, and data from v accine safet y monitoring systems ha ve demonstr ated consistently the safet y of influenza v accination during pregnancy (CDC, 2019c). Immunocompromised PeopleImmunocompromised states include a wide r ange of conditions. ACIP recommends that LAIV4 not be used for immunocompromised persons because of the uncertain but biologically plausible risk for disease attributable to the v accine virus. In addition to potential safet y issues, immune response to liv e or inactiv ated v accines might be blunted in some clinical situations, such as for persons with congenital immune deficiencies, persons receiving cancer chemother apy, and persons receiving immunosuppressiv e medications (Grohsk opf et al. , 2019). The Infectious Diseases Societ y of America (IDS A) has published guidance for the selection and timing of v accines for persons with specific immunocompromising conditions, including congenital immune disorders, stem cell and solid organ tr ansplant, anatomic and functional asplenia, and therapeutic drug-induced immunosuppression, as well as for persons with cochlear implants or other conditions leading to persistent cerebrospinal fluid-oropharyngeal communication. Giv en the lack of safet y data for LAIV in most of these populations, and the a vailabilit y of alternativ e vaccines, IIV or RIV4 should be used instead of LAIV for these persons (Grohsk opf et al. , 2019). High-Risk Households Efforts should be made to v accinate household and other close contacts of high-risk people. These include healthcare personnel, emplo yees of long-term care facilities, and household contacts of high-risk people. These individuals ma y be y ounger and healthier and more lik ely to be protected from illness than are older adults. All healthcare pro viders should receiv e annual inactiv ated influenza v accine (CDC, 2019, 2015PB). Groups to be targeted include ph ysicians, nurses, and other personnel in hospitals and outpatient settings who ha ve contact with high-risk patients in all age groups, and pro viders of home care to high-risk people (CDC, 2019, 2015PB). Older Adults Because of the vulner ability of older adults to sev ere influenza illness, hospitalization, and death, efficacy and effectiv eness of influenza v accines among older adults is an area of activ e research. Recent compar ative studies of v accine efficacy/effectiv eness against labor atory-confirmed influenza outcomes among older adults ha ve focused of these three v accines has been studied in comparison to a standard dose, unadjuv anted IIV (Grohsk opf et al. , 2019). Although HD- IIV3 has been the most extensiv ely studied, and evidence has accumulated for its superior efficacy and effectiv eness compared with SD- IIV3 in this population, no preference is expressed for an y one v accine t ype. V accination should not be dela yed if a specific product is not readily a vailable. F or persons aged 65 y ears, an y age- appropriate IIV formulation (Grohsk opf et al. , 2019). Makeup of 2019-2020 Influenza VaccinesEach y ear, experts from CDC, W orld Health Organization (WHO), and other institutions study virus samples collected from around the world to identif y the influenza viruses that are the most lik ely to cause illness during the upcoming flu season. This information is used to create a v accine. Because flu viruses are constantly changing, it is not possible to predict with certaint y which t ypes of viruses will predominate during a giv en season. Flu viruses can change from one season to the next and can ev en change within the course of one flu season. Experts must pick which viruses to include in the v accine man y months in adv ance in order for v accine to be produced and deliv ered on time. Because of these factors, there is alw ays the possibilit y of a less-than-optimal match between circulating viruses and the viruses in the v accine. The 2019-2020 U .S. trivalent influenza v accines contain A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)-lik e virus ansas/14/2017 (H3N2)-lik e virus and a B/Color ado/06/2017-lik e virus (Victoria lineage). (Grohsk opf et al. , 2019) The 2019-2020) U .S. quadriv alent v accines contain the same three antigens listed abo ve and an additional influenza B virus component, a B/Phuk et/3073/2013-lik e virus (Y amagata lineage). Compared with the 2018-2019 season, the composition for 2019-2020 includes updates in the influenza A(H1N1) and influenza A(H3N2) components of the v accine (Grohsk opf et al. , 2019). For the 2019-2020 season, routine annual influenza v accination of all people aged 6 months without contr aindications continues to be recommended. A licensed, recommended, and age- appropriate v accine should be used (Grohsk opf et al. , 2019). Two recent regulatory actions ha ve been made for the 2019-2020 season: In October 2018, the FDA appro ved an expanded age indication for Afluria Quadriv alent (IIV4). Previously licensed for persons aged 5 y ears, Afluria Quadriv alent (IIV4) is now licensed for persons aged 6 months. The dose v olume is 0.25 mL per dose for children aged 6 through 35 months and 0.5 mL per dose for all persons aged 36 months (3 y ears) (Grohsk opf et al. , 2019). Only Afluria Quadriv alent is expected to be a vailable for the 2019-2020 season. The dosage is age dependent: the dose v olume for children aged 6 through 35 months is 0.25 mL per dose and the dose v olume for all persons aged 36 months (3 y ears) is 0.5 mL per dose (Grohsk opf et al. , 2019). In January 2019, the FDA appro ved a change in dose v olume for Fluz one Quadriv alent (IIV4) from 0.25 mL to either 0.25 mL or 0.5 mL per dose for children aged 6 through 35 months. Children aged 36 months (3 y ears) and adults should receiv e 0.5 mL per dose (Grohsk opf et quadriv attenuated (weak ened) liv e flu viruses, is appro ved for use in people 2 y ears through 49 y ears of age. This vaccine is not recommended for use in pregnancy or for people with some specific medical conditions (CDC, 2019b). For the 2019-2020 flu season, ACIP recommends annual influenza v accination for ev eryone 6 months and older with an y licensed, influenza v accine that is appropriate for the recipient 's age and health status, including inactiv ated influenza v accine (IIV), recombinant nasal spr ay influenza v accine (LAIV4), with no preference expressed for any one v accine o ver another (CDC, 2019b). People with egg allergies can receiv e any licensed, recommended, age- appropriate influenza vaccine (IIV , RIV4, or LAIV4) that is otherwise appropriate. P eople who ha ve a history of sev ere egg allergy (those who ha ve had an y symptom other than hiv es after exposure to egg) should be vaccinated in a medical setting, and supervised b y a healthcare pro vider who is able to recogniz e and manage sev ere allergic reactions (CDC, 2019b). Balancing consider ations regarding the unpredictabilit y of timing of onset of the influenza season and concerns that v accine-induced immunit y might w ane o ver the course of a season, it is recommended that v accination should be offered b y the end of October . Children aged 6 months through 8 y ears who require 2 doses should receiv e their first dose as soon as possible after vaccine becomes a vailable, to allow the second dose (which must be administered 4 weeks later) to be receiv ed by the end of October (Grohsk opf et al. , 2019). Communit y vaccination progr ams, howev er, should balance maximizing lik elihood of persistence of vaccine-induced protection through the season with a voiding missed opportunities to v accinate or vaccinating after onset of influenza circulation occurs. No recommendation is made for revaccination later in the season of persons who ha ve already been fully v accinated (ie, pro viding a booster dose) (Grohsk opf et al. , 2019).

Concluding Remarks Influenza has been with us for a long time. More people died from influenza during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic than died during W orld W ar I. Lik e all viruses, influenza is v ery good at finding ways to mutate and b ypass our immune system defenses. W e have been able to sta y a step ahead by dev eloping v accines that stimulate our immune system to fight off these potentially deadly viruses. Periodically howev er, influenza outsmarts us b y mutating or shifting into a virus that our immune systems fail to recogniz e. When this happens, influenza pandemics can occur , as happened in 1918 with disastrous results. Although public health officials are rightly concerned about pandemics, seasonal influenza kills man y thousands of people ev ery year and man y of these deaths can be prev ented b y getting a flu v accination. In past y ears CDC has emphasiz ed the importance of increasing v accination r ates among high-risk groups, working tow ard a goal of univ ersal v accination. T o that end, in 2010, in an attempt to simplif y vaccination recommendations and increase v accination r ates, CDC issued guidelines stating all individuals aged 6 months or older should be v accinated annually . This univ ersal vaccination guideline reflects lessons learned from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Despite these strong recommendations, more than half of the gener al public and about 25% of healthcare work ers fail to get v accinated against flu each y ear. The situation is particularly dire in long-term care settings, where some of our most vulner able citiz ens are exposed to influenza b y unvaccinated work ers, visitors, and residents. Getting v accinated each y ear protects high-risk populations from catching the flu from the people who are supposed to be helping and protecting them.Vaccination is a vailable in a liv e-attenuated (LAIV) and an inactiv ated (IIV) form. Knowing which one works best for y ou and y our patients is important. The mak eup of this y ear's influenza v accine is based on information about which influenza viruses are circulating, how they are spreading, and how well the previous season' s vaccine viruses protected against an y that are being newly identified. VE (v accine effectiv eness) data collected from children and adults enrolled in the U .S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiv eness Network from No v. 23, 2018 through F eb. 2, 2019 indicate that the flu vaccine reduced the risk of acute respir atory virus infection (ARI) b y 46% (CDC, 2019h). Children ages 6 months to 17 y ears who were v accinated against flu last season reduced their risk of contr acting influenza A(H1N1) illness b y more than 62% and their risk for illness from all influenza t ypes b y 61%. F or all ages, the CDC said VE against influenza caused b y A(H1N1) virus infection w as 46%, and VE against illness due to influenza A(H3N2) w as 44% (CDC, 2019h). For the 2019-2020 U .S. influenza season, pro viders ma y choose to administer an y licensed, age- appropriate influenza v accine (IIV , recombinant influenza v accine, or LAIV4). LAIV4 is an option for those for whom it is otherwise appropriate. No preference is expressed for an y influenza vaccine product (Grohsk opf et al. , 2019). Vaccination should be offered as long as influenza viruses are circulating. T o avoid missed opportunities for v accination, pro viders should offer v accination during routine healthcare visits and hospitalizations when v accine is a vailable. Getting an annual influenza vaccine provides the best protection against influenza for virtually everyone. References Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). (2014).

Although the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009 has been declared officially o ver: a. Public health officials are not concerned about another influenza outbreak b. The H1N1 virus is expected to continue to circulate for man y years c. There is still no v accine against this strain of influenza d. So man y people were infected by the H1N1 virus that it likely conferred herd immunity to the entire population 2. An antigen is: a. The place where a pathogen liv es and survives b. A substance or microorganism that stimulates production of an antibody c. A protectiv e protein produced by the immune system in response to the presence of a foreign substance. d. A t ype of antiviral drug approved for preventing or treating influenza 3. The primary natur al reservoir of influenza type A viruses is: a. Pigs b. Humans and monk eys c. Reptiles d. Wild birds 4. Influenza t ype A viruses from birds, humans, and other pigs can circulate in pigs. This is important because: a. Humans can become infected with influenza b y eating pork b. Wild pigs can tr ansmit these viruses to wild birds c. It is possible for the genes of these viruses to mix (reassort) and create a new virus d. Mosquitoes that ha ve bitten a pig can transmit these viruses to humans 5. Compared to influenza caused b y type A viruses, type B influenza viruses: a.Are found only in pigs b. Are r arely reported in humans c. Are the cause of most historical influenza pandemics d. Cause milder disease than type A6. Antigenic drift, continuous small changes in one or more surface antigens of the influenza A virus: a. Causes such gr adual change in the virus that it is unrelated to major outbreaks of influenza b. May cause widespread infection because protection from past exposures is incomplete c. Occurs because of the o veruse of antibiotics, resulting in antibiotic -resistant str ains of the virus d. Happens because of mutations in immune system of the affected person 7. Antigenic shift, a major and abrupt change in influenza A viruses: a. Can lead to a worldwide pandemic b. Occurs regularly , making it relativ ely easy to adjust v accines c. Only occurs ev ery few centuries and has caused pandemics ev ery time it has happened d. Has not occurred in the past hundred y ears. 8. Pandemic influenza: a. Gener ally occurs each y ear during a specific time of the y ear b. Results from the emergence of a no vel bacterium to which the population possesses little or no immunit y c. Results from the emergence of a new influenza A virus to which the population possesses little or no immunit y d. Occurred regularly in ancient times but has not occurred in modern times 9. The 1918 influenza pandemic, caused b y an H1N1 influenza subt ype: a. Killed more people in 1 y ear than died in 4 y ears from the bubonic plague b. Was particularly virulent in North America but caused only mild illness in Europe c. Caused more deaths in hot climates and countries closer to the equator d. Was contained effectiv ely with prev ention efforts such as hand h ygiene and masking 10. Seasonal influenza differs from pandemic influenza in that: a. The length of the season is unpredictable b. It gener ally causes more illness than pandemic influenza c. It spreads r apidly because there is little or no immunit y to a new str ain d. It occurs each y ear, typically during a specific time of the y ear 11. The \"classic\" clinical symptoms of influenza: a. Typically last for at least 1 to 2 months. b. Include abrupt onset of fev er, myalgia, sore throat, cough, and headache.c. Can be treated with antibiotics in infants, children, and teenagers d. Occur more often in adults than in children 12. The most frequent influenza complication is: a. Meningitis that ma y occur up to 2 weeks after initial symptoms b. Pneumonia, especially secondary bacterial pneumonia c. Reye syndrome, especially in older adults taking aspirin d. My ocarditis, especially in people with sev ere asthma 13. Transmission of influenza in humans: a. Occurs from chronic carriers of the disease who don' t know they are infected b. Is primarily through the blood of an infected person c. Can be through contact with fecal material of individuals who ha ve symptomatic diarrhea d. Occurs primarily person to person via large virus-laden droplets gener ated b y cough or sneez e4 14. Although influenza v accination r ates are fairly high in y oung children: a. Vaccination r ates decrease with increasing age b. Vaccination r ates increase with increasing age c. Vaccination r ates are close to 100% in children aged 13 to 17 y ears d. After 2 to 4 y ears, influenza v accination is no longer needed 15.
