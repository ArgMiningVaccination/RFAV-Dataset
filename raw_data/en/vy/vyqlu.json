The film, called \" [Ancient Secrets of Essential Oils](https://essentialoilsmovie.com/)\", delves into the world of essential oils and the fascinating history of where they come from, from ancient Egypt to the times of Christ to how they were used during the World Wars and how [their resurgence is changing the way people view ](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2672.1999.00780.x/full) [healthcare.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168160504001680) You learn how peppermint oil can be used to increase tolerance to lactic acid, to how frankincense can [ destroy cancer cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27563220) to why essential oils can never be classified as a drug by the FDA to why big pharma is definitely not a fan of these natural oils and much more. As a matter of fact, even before this film came out, I myself have become a bit of an essential oil freak. Each day, without fail, I use at least [ three different essential oils](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/2014/10/how-to-use-essential-oils/) (usually relaxing lavender, rose or bergamot in my bedroom and awakening peppermint, pine or rosemary in my office) and I always (and I mean always) have one particular \"blend\" of essentials oil in my travel bag which I'll talk about later in this article. When it comes to essential oils, I consider [Dr. Sarah LoBisco](http://dr-lobisco.com/) - a naturopathic medical practitioner [certified in functional medicine](https://www.functionalmedicine.org/functiona-medicine-in-practice/certificationprogram/) - to be my go-to source for all things essential oil related. When she was on my podcast episode [\"Everything You Need To Know About Essential Oils For Fat Loss, Performance, Smart Drugs, Scar Healing, Detoxing And More\"](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/2014/10/how-to-use-essential-oils/) she discussed the scientific principles and [research behind the anti-microbial and anti-fungal properties that specific essential oils have,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21809946) and how these oils can be used to treat various conditions such as inflammation and immune system disorders, and also improve physical and [cognitive performance. ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23645071) Dr. Sarah knows more about how to intelligently use essential oils than any other person I know. And because of this ability to tap into natural plant-based extracts, she's able to pull off [healing for patients](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26996621), huge [improvements in immune function](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27542872), and even a [competitive edge in athletes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3607906/) without turning to big pharma drugs.

What if you were a science-geek aspiring to become a medical practitioner or pharmacist and got side-tracked by what you initially thought was \"airy-fairy snack oil?\" Not soon after, you found yourself in [naturopathic medical school](http://www.bridgeport.edu/academics/graduate/naturopathic-medicine-nd/curriculum-and-program-requirements/) and becoming [certified in functional medicine](https://www.functionalmedicine.org/functiona-medicine-in-practice/certificationprogram/). You'd need to swallow a little bit of humble pie, right? Welcome to my world. I started using essential oils over fifteen years ago. Even with my skepticism, these volatile constituents surprisingly produced results. I was impressed, I waived my acceptance letters into the conventional healthcare world and headed to the [University of Bridgeport College of Naturopathic Medicine.](http://www.bridgeport.edu/academics/graduate/naturopathic-medicine-nd/curriculum-and-program-requirements/) I wanted to learn the science beyond natural medicine while still embracing the strengths of mainstream medicine. In other words, I wanted to feed my brain all there was to know about the pharmacology and phytochemistry of herbal plants as therapeutic agents. Since graduating, essential oils have been one of my most powerful health tools in my practice to balance the body, mind, and spirit. They also offer a competitive edge in athletes, not [just in their ability to enhance focus and performance](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/2015/07/mint-chocolate-water-upper-lip-peppermint-sniffing-peppermint-fat-bombs-more-how-peppermint-can-enhance-performance/), but because they can keep someone in peak health. Ben and I have been working together with essential oils for a few years. He's asked me to share about one of our favorite essential oils blends to demonstrate the power and versatility that can be found in one 15ml bottle. So, let's get to it... After reading this article, you will have a better understanding of: - The science of essential oils - Their ancient history- turned modern vindication - 10 powerful ways one essential oils blend can become your best biohacking tool A little disclaimer before I get started. The FDA has not smiled about correlating specific brands to independent research on individual oils. To keep the Feds happy, this overview will describe a formulation Ben and I use based on ancient tradition, references found in peer-reviewed journal, and my clinical experience. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- The Science: Introduction to Essential Oils and Their Biochemistry So what exactly are essential oils? Essential oils are volatile secondary plant metabolites extracted from aromatic plant material by steam distillation or mechanical expression.1-10 Oils which are produced with the use of chemical solvents are not considered true essential oils due to the resulting alteration of chemical constituents from the solvent residues.1,10 These powerful compounds are produced by plants in order to provide defense from infestations, modulate immune function, and to stimulate various molecular pathways need for thriving.1-10 Their constituents can interact with cellular pathways to alter biochemical responses and optimize physiological function.1-14 Essential oils have been demonstrated to: inhibit microbe growth,3-5, 8-10 act as antioxidants,4-5, 8,10,13 support hormones,8,10 and calm inflammation. 2-6, 8,10,14 These plant substances not only exert modulation of molecular pathways and cellular receptor interaction,1-14 but also provide a profound impact on our bodies and mind through their aromatic qualities alone.15-24 For example, it has been demonstrated that odor can act as a stimulus producing changes in physiology independent of, and in connection to, psychological and memory-based associations of the smell.15-18, 21-25 These effects include modulation of skin conduction, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and regional cerebral blood flow.20-24 Furthermore, the psychological and memory-enhanced associations with odor can impact mood, stress, and emotional state.15-25 Essential oils are absorbed easily into our system through skin application, inhalation, or ingestion and excreted quickly, mostly through the kidneys.8,10,26-29 They have a low toxicity profile, when used in their proper, pure form.8,10 Finally, let's delive into a bit of essential oils biochemistry 101, shall we? As Ben would say, \"get your propeller hats on.\" Here goes... The major chemical constituents of essential oils terpenes, esters, metabolites can be classified on the basis of their structure (terpenes, terpenoids, phenylpropenes, or degradation products), solubility, or synthesis. One common way to group the volatile components is to organize them as either terpenoids or phenylpropanoids, or alternatively, into hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds. 10 Different plants exhibit varying amounts of each of these compounds providing a unique fragrance and physical signature of each species. Furthermore, the secondary metabolites produced within each species will vary based on raw materials, harvesting methods, location and climate, manufacturing, and distillation techniques.1,10,30-32 (I did a pretty comprehensive [review of standardization](http://www.saratoga.com/living-well/2016/05/regulation-standardization-quality-control--oh-my.html) and [quality ](http://dr-lobisco.com/essential-oils-quality-and-safety/)in previous blogs if you want to learn more details.) Alrighty, now that your propeller hats are all warmed up as far as the science of essential oils, let's get to the history of essential oils in general and regarding the formulation of this little known ancient remedy. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- History of [Aromatherapy](https://www.alliance-aromatherapists.org/history-basics) and Essential Oils Let's start at the beginning... The history of the use of aromatics dates back thousands of years. A search through the literature, desk references, and the internet details various applications of the use of volatile plant medicines across cultures all throughout ancient times. The general consensus of the birth of [aromatherapy](https://www.alliance-aromatherapists.org/history-basics) is estimated to be between 6,000-3,500 years ago. According to some of the more cited websites, references, and authorities, essential oils used for various treatments has been recorded in early civilizations of Mesopotamia, China, India, Persia and ancient Egypt.10, 30-45 China may have been the first to use odorants for well-being.33 I have found several references stating their applications are found in translations of The Yellow Emperor's Book of Internal Medicine.35-37 Still, other texts and blogs believe that usage began with Egypt civilizations.10,41,43 The modern technological advances that allow us to enjoy the more concentrated and precise distillation of essential oil's medicinal and therapeutic constituents obviously did not exist in these times; however elemental techniques for isolating the fragrant and volatile components were employed. For instance, ancient Egypt is credited for extracting oils by infusion using rudimentary distillation techniques. Others believe distillation originates within Persia and India's earliest history. Later on the Greeks, Romans, and Islamic extraction and distillation techniques refined crude methods.10,33 10, 30-42 The \"Smell Report\" from the Social Issues Research Centre states: The process by which a flower's scent is extracted and preserved using alcohol distillation is believed to have been discovered by Avicenna, the 11th century Arabian alchemist and physician, who stumbled on it while trying to isolate for Islam the soul of its holy rose. Before this, perfumes consisted only of thick resins and gums and gooey unguents.37 Perhaps the most quoted use of ancient times is during the Roman Empire within the New Testament. Hundreds of citations exist in the Holy Text of frankincense, cedarwood, hyssop, fir, and spikenard to heal physical ailments and enhance spiritual communion. The gifts to the Christ Child of gold, frankincense, and myrrh highlight the prized value of fragrance at the time.38-40 During the Renaissance period, Europeans continued the task.30-45 Recently, science has been able to study and document the composition of natural plants with the resurgence of modern usage dating to 1910 by Dr. Rene-Maurice Gattefosse, a French chemist. He discovered lavender's skin-regenerating properties when his severely-burned arm healed without a scar after he immersed it in a pure lavender oil, thinking it was water. As a result of his lab discovery, lavender is still listed in the British Pharmacopoeia for its healing properties in the skin.44-45 Now, onto the story beyond [this specific Thieves blend](https://www.youngliving.org/bengreenfield)... \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- It Starts with Ancient Wisdom: The Story Behind Thieves \"Four thieves\" remedy is based on an ancient herbal formulation originating somewhere-in Europe with time spanning from 1413-1722. Due to its touted protective benefits, herbalists have passed along its recipe for hundreds of years.46-49 The legend states that a combination of various herbs, most often [cinnamon,](http://dr-lobisco.com/5-reasons-to-spice-up-summer-with-cinnamon-oil/) [eucalyptus](http://dr-lobisco.com/9-reasons-to-love-eucalyptus-oil/), [rosemary](http://dr-lobisco.com/5-proven-reasons-rosemary-essential-oil-is-on-my-mind-and-so-much-more/), [clove](http://dr-lobisco.com/clove-essential-oil/), and [lemon](http://dr-lobisco.com/the-benefits-of-lemon-essential-oil/) as protecting four robbers from contracting the plague in France while rummaging through the houses of the infected sufferers. Their freedom was won by revealing to the King that the herbal vinegar, which they drank and sprinkled on themselves every two hours, had been their saving grace.46,49 There have been several variations of this formulation passed down through the years. Thomas Jefferson was said to have fancied a version that consisted of vinegar spiked with lavender, rosemary, sage, wormwood, rue, mint, garlic to keep his Presidential body infection free.47 The Scientific American Encyclopedia of Formulas: partly based upon the 28th ed. of Scientific American cyclopedia of receipts, notes and queries cites the formula of this herbal preparation as follows: - 4 oz dried rosemary tops - 4 oz dried sage - 2 oz dried lavender - 5 oz fresh rue - 1 oz camphor dissolved in vinegar - \u00bc oz sliced garlic - 1 dr bruised cloves - 1 gallon strongly distilled wine vinegar \"Digest for 7 or 8 days, with occasional agitation: pour off liquor: press out the remainder, and filter the mixed liquids.\"48 As stated in the Smell Report, the value of a wide range of aromatics for keeping the body healthy was widely utilized: The plague was not the only malady to be treated with fragrances. In the 17th, 18th and even into the 19th century, perfumes were widely used as remedies for almost any physical or mental disorder - including hysteria, amenorrhea, melancholia, hypochondria, headaches and the common cold-37 I don't know about you, but I like the ease of one bottle, pre-blended, and easily packed for on-the-go. Furthermore, I love the science beyond the individual essential oils and the synergism. So, now, it's time for the main event...the unveiling of the power of a blend of some of the most common aromatics found in \"Four Thieves Vinegar.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 10 Modern Day Applications of Ancient Wisdom - Diffusing- Cleaning the Air of Germs and Molds An experiment was done to see if the aerosol use of essential oils could alleviate some of the microbial causes of sick-building syndrome. The researchers used the actual proprietary blend that Ben and I use of clove, lemon, cinnamon bark, eucalyptus radiata, and rosemary. The method employed for measurement was deposition sampling. It was found that this blend did exhibit inhibition of certain microbes at various percentages. Reductions in critters initially increased with time of diffusion, though after certain time frames for specific bugs, the decreased level remained constant. The abstract states: [Thieves](https://www.youngliving.org/bengreenfield), a commercial blend of five essential oils, was tested for its antibacterial activity against Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus bioaerosols. An aerosol suspension of each bacterial culture was sprayed into a 0.4 m3 enclosed fume hood previously sterilized by ultraviolet light. Thieves essential oil blend was then diffused into the hood for a given time. Depositional sampling results showed a significant reduction (P<0.0001) in the aerosol-borne bacterial load after diffusion of the oil blend. Controls showed no inhibitory effect of oil that may have settled on the exposed plate surfaces during bacterial depositional sampling. Inhibition levels appear to be organism specific. There was an 82% reduction in M. luteus bioaerosol, a 96% reduction in the P. aeruginosa bioaerosol, and a 44% reduction in the S. aureus bioaerosol following 10 min of exposure. Results for the time exposure threshold of diffused oil showed that after only six min a 90% reduction in M. luteus viability occurred. Diffusion of the oil blend, Thieves, can significantly reduce the number of aerosol-borne bacteria and may have application in treating air for enclosed environments and preventing transmission of aerosol-borne bacterial pathogens.50 [Here's a link to the full study](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10412905.1998.9700958) that explains the three parts of the experiment, the results, and the conclusion.50 [This is a link](https://books.google.com/books?id=MGsKnMsrzawC&lpg=PA263&ots=U5j43bs-2p&dq=Chapter%2014%20Environmental%20Microbial%20Properties%20and%20Processes%3A%20Strategies%20and%20Methods%20for%20Air%20Sampling&pg=PA273#v=onepage&q=depositional%20sample&f=false) to explain deposition sampling, which as mentioned, was used to measure results.51 A 2005 field study was with Dr. Close also found diffusing this same blend of essential oils decreased \"black mold.\"52 (If you're interested in learning how essential oils can affect mold exposure, I wrote a blog about it [here](http://dr-lobisco.com/mold-health-connection/) with scientific references.) Though not found in this [Thieves](https://www.youngliving.org/bengreenfield) blend essential oil, [another study with thyme oil](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2006.02032.x/full) demonstrated its use against moulds formation in damp dwellings. The authors concluded: The thyme essential oil possesses a wide range spectrum of fungicidal activity. The vaporous phase of the oil exhibited long-lasting suppressive activity on moulds from damp dwellings.53 Bottom line: This blend can help to inhibit microbes in your surrounding environment. - Respiratory Support You've got to get oxygen to perform, right? A key ingredient in [Thieves](https://www.youngliving.org/bengreenfield), Eucalyptus Oil (EO), is well known for its respiratory support via inhalation or oral route. A review article in Alternative Medicine Review states: Application by either vapor inhalation or oral route provides benefit for both purulent and non-purulent respiratory problems, such as bronchitis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There is a long history of folk usage with a good safety record. More recently, the biochemical details behind these effects have been clarified. Although other plant oils may be more microbiologically active, the safety of moderate doses of EO and its broad-spectrum antimicrobial action make it an attractive alternative to pharmaceuticals. 54 In another study, another species of eucalyptus, eucalyptus globulus was tested for cytotoxicity and antibacterial activity against common pathogens linked to respiratory infections. The study demonstrated that that the following bacteria were most susceptible to EO: H. influenza, parinfluenzae, and S. maltophila followed by S. puneumonia. Eucalyptus globulus also had a mild inhibitory activity against a strain of the mumps virus. Researchers used clinical specimens of patients with upper respiratory infections to determine these results: The activity of Eucalyptus globulus essential oil was determined for 120 isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 isolates of S. pneumoniae, 40 isolates of S. agalactiae, 20 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 40 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, 30 isolates of H. parainfluenzae, 10 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 isolates of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and two viruses, a strain of adenovirus and a strain of mumps virus, all obtained from clinical specimens of patients with respiratory tract infections. The cytotoxicity was evaluated on VERO cells by the MTT test. The antibacterial activity was evaluated by the Kirby Bauer paper method, minimum inhibitory concentration, and minimum bactericidal concentration. H. influenzae, parainfluenzae, and S. maltophilia were the most susceptible, followed by S. pneumoniae. The antiviral activity, assessed by means of virus yield experiments titered by the end-point dilution method for adenovirus, and by plaque reduction assay for mumps virus, disclosed only a mild activity on mumps virus.55 1,8-cineole, a monoterpene found in EO species56 is known for supporting the respiratory tract. This recent abstract reported on its potential use in those with respiratory issues beyond even killing bugs- through inhibiting inflammation and due to its antioxidant properties: 1,8-cineole is a natural monoterpene, also known as eucalyptol. It is a major compound of many plant essential oils, mainly extracted from Eucalyptus globulus oil. As an isolated compound, 1,8-cineole is known for its mucolytic and spasmolytic action on the respiratory tract, with proven clinical efficacy. 1,8-cineole has also shown therapeutic benefits in inflammatory airway diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This clinical evidence refers to its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant mode of action, which has been proven in numerous pre-clinical studies. In vitro studies found strong evidence that 1,8-cineole controls inflammatory processes and mediator production of infection- or inflammation-induced mucus hypersecretion by its action as anti-inflammatory modifier rather than a simple mucolytic agent. The aim of this review is to present these preclinical studies performed with the pure monoterpene, and to summarize the current knowledge on the mode of action of 1,8-cineole. The actual understanding of the pure 1,8-cineole compared to mixtures of natural volatile oils containing 1,8-cineole as a major compound and to mixtures of natural terpenes, known as essential oils, will be discussed. Based on the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, recent clinical trials with 1,8-cineole have shown first evidence for the beneficial use of 1,8-cineole as long-term therapy in the prevention of COPD-exacerbations and to improve asthma control.57 Cinnamon bark oil, has also been shown to inhibit gram positive and gram negative bacteria associated with various infections58-62 as well \"fungitoxic\" to various fungi related to respiratory tract mycoses. The abstract on cinnamon reads: Cinnamic aldehyde has been identified as the active fungitoxic constituent of cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) bark oil. The fungitoxic properties of the vapours of the oil/active constituent against fungi involved in respiratory tract mycoses, i.e., Aspergillus niger, A. fumigatus, capsulatum, were determined in vitro as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum lethal concentration (MLC), inoculum density sustained, and exposure duration for fungicidal action at MIC and higher doses, as well as effect of incubation temperatures on fungitoxicity. It is concluded that these inhalable vapours appear to approach the ideal chemotherapy for respiratory tract mycoses.59 Bottom line: This blend contains single oils that support the respiratory system and inhibit unwanted bugs in your own body. 3 and 4. Food Spoilage and Cooking No one likes it when the power goes out for many reasons. One is the stress that their recent grocery shop trip with its good packed tightly in the warming fridge could become a financial wash. Essential oils, including clove and cinnamon, have been tested for and used to prevent common food spoilage of various pathogens.63-66 The Food and Drug Administration has an exhaustive list of [essential oils listed generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for ingestion here.](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=182.20) 67 Essential oils can be used in cooking as flavorings with [more powerful benefits than herbs](http://dr-lobisco.com/essential-oils-potency/) due to their concentration. Still make sure you are using essential oil that safe for ingestion. Many reports of toxicity are due to [improper use, overdose](http://dr-lobisco.com/are-essential-oils-safe/), [media hype](http://dr-lobisco.com/essential-oils-quality-and-safety/), and [nontherapeutic or toxic oils](http://dr-lobisco.com/a-look-at-essential-oils-safety-children-dosages/). If the bottle says \"do not ingest,\" do not ingest. that should not be ingested. Therefore [, be sure to be an educated consumer](http://dr-lobisco.com/essentialoil-druginteractions/) and remember that one drop will do ya.' Bottom line: A drop of [Thieves](https://www.youngliving.org/bengreenfield) blend on questionable food or taken internally (with a teaspoon of [coconut oil](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/coconut-oil-amazon)) may help prevent symptoms from contaminated foods. It can also be a great addition to a winter recipe of your favorite warm drink. (Tastes like spicy cinnamon) - Stopping Unwanted Microbes and Superbugs Probably one of the most famous uses, besides their aromatic applications, are essential oils ability [to work against microbes](). Essential oils antimicrobial effects are vast.68-74 The Journal of Biological Chemistry explain one mechanism of the toxicity of cyclic hydrocarbons such as aromatics, terpenes, and alicyclics on bugs. The authors report, \"The impairment of microbial activity by the cyclic hydrocarbons most likely results from hydrophobic interaction with the membrane, which affects the functioning of the membrane and membrane-embedded proteins.\"68 It has been stated that the vast constituents and resultant actions found within one oil, and the synergism of blends, may be key components to why they are effective against multiple \"resistant\" microorganisms.77-82 In fact, some believe they have the potential to be a welcome alternative to medications which have potential toxic side effects on patients. In simple terms, essential oils may be able outsmart \"resistant\" organisms with more than one mechanism of action. For instance, [several studies](http://dr-lobisco.com/can-essential-oils-inhibit-microbe-growth/) have demonstrated oregano's potential to prevent resistance by inhibiting biofilms. For example, one study tested the antimicrobial activity of the essential oils from clove (Syzygium aromaticum (L.) Merr. et Perry) and rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) alone and in combination. The authors reported the results as follows: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against three Gram-positive bacteria, three Gram-negative bacteria and two fungi were determined for the essential oils and their mixtures. Furthermore, time-kill dynamic processes of clove and rosemary essential oils against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans were tested. Both essential oils possessed significant antimicrobial effects against all microorganisms tested. The MICs of clove oil ranged from 0.062% to 0.500% (v/v), while the MICs of rosemary oil ranged from 0.125% to 1.000% (v/v). The antimicrobial activity of combinations of the two essential oils indicated their additive, synergistic or antagonistic effects against individual microorganism tests. The time-kill curves of clove and rosemary essential oils towards three strains showed clearly bactericidal and fungicidal processes of (1)/(2) x MIC, MIC, MBC and 2 x MIC.83 An another in vitro study that tested the anti-bacterial activity of [twenty-one selected essential oils](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1693916/table/T1/) against pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus), the authors found that 19 of the oils showed antibacterial activity against one or more strains of the microbes tested. They reported: Cinnamon, clove, geranium, lemon, lime, orange and rosemary oils exhibited significant inhibitory effect. Cinnamon oil showed promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, whereas aniseed, eucalyptus and camphor oils were least active against the tested bacteria. In general, B. subtilis was the most susceptible. On the other hand, K. pneumoniae exhibited low degree of sensitivity.84 There are a few caveats to this study. The oils were deemed \"pure\" but methods weren't given. Furthermore, the authors reported only analyzing cinnamon oil with the GC/MS analysis. Interesting, right? When the [quality](http://dr-lobisco.com/essential-oils-quality-and-safety/) was verified, that essential oil was deemed one of the most powerful. (Just sayin.') Some essential oils may also have an additive effect with certain antibiotics. An in vitro study using Cinnamon and lemon explored their antimicrobial activity against Acinetobacter, which has been linked to serious infections and antimicrobial resistance. The authors found: Results of combining antibiotics and essential oils had shown us a synergistic effect with both essential oils/amikacin combinations. An additive effect was observed with the combinations of both essential oils and gentamicin. The results of this study suggest that essential oil of C. limon and C. zeylanicum may suppress the growth of Acinetobacter species and could be a source of metabolites with antibacterial modifying activity.85 Bottom Line: Essential oils in this blend are potent microbe inhibitors for a variety of critters. They may also have a synergistic effect when used with other immune support measures. Still, be smart and know there [are potential oil-medication interactions](http://dr-lobisco.com/essentialoil-druginteractions/). - Antioxidant Several studies have demonstrated essential oils ability to act as antioxidants. 4-5, 8,10,13,86 Importantly, these secondary metabolites act to stimulate our own endogenous antioxidants. One in vivo study with rats explored how rosemary essential oil (REO) protected their livers from oxidative damage and reported: In summary, the present results demonstrate that administration of REO, exhibiting free radical scavenging activity determined by DPPH assay, exerts beneficial effects on preventing CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in rats by limiting the extent of lipid peroxidation and hence cell membranes injuries. Considering the significant impact on activities of examined antioxidant enzymes, it is clear that REO mediates its hepatoprotective effects not only through scavenging of harmful free radicals, but also through activation of physiological defense mechanisms. It should be emphasized that there have been considerable variations in the chemical composition of essential oils obtained from rosemary, and for this reason, the use of REO in preventing and/or treatment of various liver diseases requires the identification of active ingredients and further investigations on their mechanisms of action.86 Here's a blog I wrote on some studies with the cognitive benefits of antioxidant protection using [lavender](http://dr-lobisco.com/using-lavender-universal-oil-calming-mood-support-brain-health-immune-support/) [and rosemary](http://dr-lobisco.com/5-proven-reasons-rosemary-essential-oil-is-on-my-mind-and-so-much-more/). Bottom Line: Essential oils can modulate oxidative stress, a big problem with excess exercise. This can be through modulating our own production of antioxidants as well as supplying secondary metabolites that protect cells from injury. - Oral Health One of the most famous oils for [dental health is clove](http://dr-lobisco.com/clove-essential-oil/).87-88 I have actually experienced personally an application of straight clove or Thieves oil for preventing cavities. Interestingly, one in vitro study showed clove [may in fact prevent decalcification](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3432374/) caused by apple juice.88 You can read more about essential oils for applications in [dental health here](http://dr-lobisco.com/clove-essential-oil/) and how they can be used with [oil pulling here](http://dr-lobisco.com/an-oily-mouth-makes-for-a-clean-one/). Bottom Line: Due to the [downstream and harmful systemic effects of an unbalanced oral microbiome](http://www.saratoga.com/living-well/2016/04/what-dangers-lurk-in-your-mouth.html), I instruct most of my clients to put a drop of [Thieves](https://www.youngliving.org/bengreenfield) oil on their toothbrush a few times a week. - Digestion This article gives a comprehensive overview of essential oils for digestion. A 2012 review article provided support that essential oils can work in synergism with probiotics to have \"complementary antimicrobial effects with practically no side effects.\"89 Bottom Line: The oils in the [Thieves](https://www.youngliving.org/bengreenfield) blend have been shown in many studies to prevent microbial infections of the gut and there is evidence that disturbance [of the microbiome](http://dr-lobisco.com/naturopathic-and-functional-medicine-and-essential-oils-lyme/) is unlikely due to their immune modulating effects. - Discomfort In [a systematic review of essential oils](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2221169115001033), the authors analyzed ten common essential oils were for their actions, based on their constituents and the whole oils. The following oils were reported by the authors to modulate pain that are found in Thieves: - Eucalyptus- regulation of the nervous system relating to neuralgia, headache, and debility, treatment for joint and muscle pains (rheumatoid arthritis), and for muscle and joint pains and aches90-91 - Lemon- may help with labor pain, nausea, vomiting, and ulcers90-92 - Rosemary- soothes menstrual cramps, contains the anti-inflammatory constituent 1-8 cineole In regards to direct pain management, the authors listed the following oils: - Eucalyptus smithii (gully gum) - Lavandula officinale (ginger)90 Bottom one to two drops of [Thieves](https://www.youngliving.org/bengreenfield) applied [with a carrier oil](http://dr-lobisco.com/carrier-oil-and-essential-oils/) on the bottom of your feet or on location of discomfort could produce a cooling, comforting relief. - The Aroma- More Than a Smell Besides all the powerful benefits above based on essential oils composition, their aroma alone can combine to produce powerful emotional and physiological effects. You can read more about this [here.](http://dr-lobisco.com/essential-oils-for-mood-and-emotions/) \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Conclusion Phew, see why this blend, and essential oils in general, are the most underused and ancient biohack around? To get the benefits of this essential oil, you can apply one drop to the bottom of your feet daily with a [carrier oil](http://dr-lobisco.com/carrier-oil-and-essential-oils/) or take a drop internally if you feel the sniffles coming on. The possibilities are endless. To learn more about [applications and uses of essential oils, listen to the podcast](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/2014/10/how-to-use-essential-oils/) Ben and I did a few years back. You can also access my reviews of essential oils single, the science, and clinical uses of these powerful secondary metabolites on my Essential Oils Database [here.](http://dr-lobisco.com/carrier-oil-and-essential-oils/) [Here's the link to order the Thieves blend Ben and I use.](https://www.youngliving.org/bengreenfield) Happy oiling! \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Summary From Ben Big pharma tends to patent chemicals and turn them into expensive drugs. As you've just learned, essential oils - particularly Thieves - can achieve the same effects, but are natural derivates of plants that can't be patented. So they get underplayed by modern medicine, and fly under the radar. But if you open my bathroom cabinet (or the kitchen and bathroom cabinets of some of the smartest physicians, healers and athletes I know), the shelves are not lined with drugs and prescriptions. They're lined with herbs, natural supplements and - you guessed it - essential oils. To learn more about the [applications and uses of essential oils, listen to this podcast I recorded with Dr. Sarah.](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/2014/10/how-to-use-essential-oils/) You can also access her [reviews of essential oils, the science, and clinical uses of these powerful secondary metabolites on her Essential Oils Database by clicking here.](http://dr-lobisco.com/carrier-oil-and-essential-oils/) Finally, because you are now a relative master of all things essential oils, start using them. Grab a few and play around. [On this page, you can find the top oils that I personally use and recommend. ](https://www.youngliving.org/bengreenfield)Unlike many other \"science-y\" wellness tools or biohacks, essential oils are easy to apply to your routine and are relatively inexpensive. I recommend you start by getting your hands on a few bottles of Four Thieves. [Click here to get the Young Living Thieves blend that I personally use, and stash a few bottles around the house, in the car, and in your travel bag.](https://www.youngliving.org/bengreenfield) You can use Thieves orally (especially when diluted with [coconut oil](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/coconut-oil-amazon)), use it topically, or just diffuse in your house in whichever room you want. If you were to start with just one oil, Thieves would be the one I'd recommend. Do you have questions, comments or feedback for Dr. Sarah or me about any of these essential oil tips and tricks?
