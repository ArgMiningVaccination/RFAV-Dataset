The Law Revision Commission has approved the substance of this report, but minor editorial changes may be made prior to final publication. November 2019 California Law Revision Commission c/o UC Davis School of Law Davis, CA 95616 650-494-1335 <commission@clrc.ca.gov> SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATION At the request of the Legislature, the Law Revision Commission prepared a recommendation that proposes to recodify the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") in a more user-friendly manner without changing its substantive effect. To facilitate logical reorganization of the CPRA, the proposed recodification would relocate the CPRA in a new division (Division 10) of Title 1 of the Government Code. That would entail renumbering the entire CPRA. Hundreds of provisions throughout the codes cross-refer to the CPRA, in whole or in part. If the recodification is enacted, those provisions will need to be revised to conform to the new numbering scheme. This recommendation proposes the necessary conforming revisions. This recommendation was prepared pursuant to Resolution Chapter 158 of the Statutes of 2018. Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - - 1 CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT CLEAN-UP: CONFORMING REVISIONS In 2016, the Legislature directed the Law Revision Commission to conduct a 1 strictly nonsubstantive clean-up of the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\")1 2 and related provisions.2 The goal is to make the CPRA easier for the public to use 3 and understand.3 4 As requested, the Commission prepared a proposed recodification of the CPRA.4 5 To facilitate sound reorganization, the proposed recodification would relocate the 6 CPRA to a new division (Division 10) of Title 1 of the Government Code. Every 7 existing code section would be renumbered,5 some of those sections (particularly 8 the long ones) would be split into two or more new sections, and substantively 9 similar provisions would be placed together in a logical order. 10 Literally hundreds of provisions throughout the codes cross-refer to the CPRA, 11 in whole or in part. If the recodification is enacted, those provisions will need to 12 be revised to conform to the new numbering scheme. 13 This recommendation proposes the necessary conforming revisions. In general, 14 they are quite straightforward. A few key points are explained below. 15 Nonsubstantive Reform 16 In directing the Commission to study the CPRA, the Legislature said that the 17 Commission's recommended legislation should \"[c]learly express legislative intent 18 without any change in the substantive provisions\" and \"[n]either expand nor 19 contract the scope of existing exemptions to the general rule that records are open 20 to the public pursuant to the current provisions of the Public Records Act.\"6 The 21 Commission was very careful to adhere to that limitation in preparing its proposed 22 recodification of the CPRA.7 23 The Commission took similar care in preparing the conforming revisions 24 presented in this recommendation. In particular, the proposed legislation would 25 1. Gov't Code \u00a7\u00a7 6250-6276.48. 2. 2016 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 150 (ACR 148 (Chau)); see also 2018 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 158 (SCR 91 (Roth)) (reaffirming Commission's authority to study CPRA). 3. See, e.g., Assembly Committee on Judiciary Analysis of ACR 148 (April 19, 2016), p. 3; Senate Committee on Judiciary Analysis of ACR 138 (June 14, 2016), p. 4. 4.

The CPRA would be recodified as Government Code Sections 7920.000-7930.215. 6. 2016 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 150 (emphasis added). 7. For a description of specific measures the Commission took to prevent any substantive change, see CPRA Recodification, supra note 4, at 217-25. Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - - 2 only update the cross-references to the CPRA and make other minor technical 1 revisions, such as: 2 Correction of spelling8 and typographical errors.9 3 Correction of grammatical and punctuation errors, especially improper 4 usage of \"which\" instead of \"that.\"10 5 Elimination of gendered pronouns.11 6 Insertion of subdivision or paragraph labels (where this would not create 7 any ambiguity or necessitate additional conforming revisions).12 8 Other revisions to conform to legislative drafting conventions.13 9 Correction of erroneous cross-references. Each such correction is explained 10 in the accompanying comment.14 11 A few miscellaneous technical revisions.15 12 Consistent with the limited scope of its legislative mandate, the Commission did 13 not consider, and is not proposing, any other kinds of changes to the provisions 14 affected by this recommendation.16 15 8. See proposed amendment of Educ. Code \u00a7 44438 infra (\"subdivison\" instead of \"subdivision\"); Safety Code \u00a7 25214.8.5 infra (\"fourth\" instead of \"forth\"). of Gov't Code \u00a7 6204.1 infra; proposed amendment of Health & Safety Code \u00a7 110845 infra. 10.

See, e.g., proposed amendment of Gov't Code \u00a7 12894.5 infra (deleting phrase \"of the Government Code,\" which is not necessary when cross-referring to provision in same code); proposed amendment of Pub. Res. Code \u00a7 41821.6 infra (replacing word \"such,\" which is disfavored in legislative drafting except in phrase \"such as\"); proposed amendment of Veh. Code \u00a7 12801.9 (replacing \"Internet Web site\" with \"internet website,\" which is current preferred usage). 14.

Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - - 3 Due to their bulk, the conforming revisions in this recommendation probably 1 will be introduced as a separate bill, instead of being included in the same bill as 2 the CPRA recodification itself. Regardless of whether they are in a separate bill, 3 the Commission will make sure that they are statutorily defined to be part of the 4 \"CPRA Recodification Act of 2020.\"17 5 That is important, because the proposed recodification includes the following 6 provision: 7 7920.100. Nothing in the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020 is intended to 8 substantively change the law relating to inspection of public records. The act is 9 intended to be entirely nonsubstantive in effect. Every provision of this division 10 and every other provision of this act, including, without limitation, every cross-11 reference in every provision of the act, shall be interpreted consistent with the 12 nonsubstantive intent of the act.18 13 This provision underscores the nonsubstantive nature of the recodification as a 14 whole and the updated cross-references in particular. It will help to ensure that the 15 courts and others interpret the recodification accordingly. 16 Contingent Operation 17 On the assumption that the conforming revisions will be introduced as a separate 18 bill, the proposed legislation includes an uncodified provision that would make the 19 conforming revisions operative only if the recodification bill is enacted and 20 becomes operative.19 The Commission will insert the appropriate bill number in 21 that uncodified provision after the recodification bill is introduced. 22 Subordination Clause 23 The proposed legislation also includes a subordination clause, in case one or 24 more of the code provisions with a conforming revision is also amended in a 25 substantive manner by another bill.20 The subordination clause would ensure that 26 the substantive reform overrides the conforming revision, regardless of which bill 27 is chaptered first. Although the conforming revision would be nullified by the 28 substantive reform, it could be reintroduced the following year and a stopgap 29 provision in the proposed recodification would make the outdated cross-reference 30 workable in the interim.21 31 16. Accordingly, readers should not infer that the Commission has evaluated and approved language that would not be changed by this recommendation. 17. \"CPRA Recodification Act of 2020\" is defined in proposed Government Code Section 7920.005. See CPRA Recodification, supra note 4, at 251. 18. CPRA Recodification, supra note 4, at 251 (emphasis added). 19. See proposed uncodified provision on contingent operation (at end of proposed legislation) infra. 20. See proposed uncodified subordination clause (at end of proposed legislation) infra. 21. See proposed 7920.105(b) in CPRA Recodification, supra note 4, at 252 (\"A reference in a statute to a previously existing provision that is restated and continued in this division, or in any other provision Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - - 4 Legislation Enacted in 2019 1 Some of the code provisions that cross-refer to the CPRA were amended in 2 2019.22 In preparing conforming revisions of those code provisions, the 3 Commission started from the newly-amended versions. 4 ____________________ of the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, shall, unless a contrary intent appears, be deemed a reference to the restatement and continuation.\"). 22.

This paragraph shall not require a separate entrance to the 29 optometrist's leased space. 30 (4) All signs and displays shall be separate and distinct from that of the other 31 occupants and shall have the optometrist's name and the word \"optometrist\" 32 prominently displayed in connection therewith. This paragraph shall not prohibit the 33 optometrist from advertising the optometrist's practice location with reference to 34 other occupants or prohibit the optometrist or registered dispensing optician from 35 advertising their participation in any health plan's network or the health plan's 36 products in which the optometrist or registered dispensing optician participates. 37 (5) There shall be no signs displayed on any part of the premises or in any 38 advertising indicating that the optometrist is employed or controlled by the 39 registered dispensing optician, health plan or optical company. 40 (6) Except for a statement that an independent doctor of optometry is located in 41 the leased space, in-store pricing signs and as otherwise permitted by this 42 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 25 - subdivision, the registered dispensing optician or optical company shall not link its 1 advertising with the optometrist's name, practice, or fees. 2 (7) Notwithstanding paragraphs (4) and (6), this subdivision shall not preclude a 3 health plan from advertising its health plan products and associated premium costs 4 and any copayments, coinsurance, deductibles, or other forms of cost sharing, or the 5 names and locations of the health plan's providers, including any optometrists or 6 registered dispensing opticians that provide professional services, in compliance 7 with the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975 (Chapter 2.2 8 (commencing with Section 1340) of Division 2 of the Health and Safety Code). 9 (8) A health plan that advertises its products and services in accordance with 10 paragraph (7) shall not advertise the optometrist's fees for products and services that 11 are not included in the health plan's contract with the optometrist. 12 (9) The optometrist shall not be precluded from collecting fees for services that 13 are not included in a health plan's products and services, subject to any patient 14 disclosure requirements contained in the health plan's provider agreement with the 15 optometrist or that are not otherwise prohibited by the Knox-Keene Health Care 16 Service Plan Act of 1975 (Chapter 2.2 (commencing with Section 1340) of Division 17 2 of the Health and Safety Code). 18 (10) The term of the lease shall be no less than one year and shall not require the 19 optometrist to contract exclusively with a health plan. The optometrist may 20 terminate the lease according to the terms of the lease. The landlord may terminate 21 the lease for the following reasons: 22 (A) The optometrist's failure to maintain a license to practice optometry or the 23 imposition of restrictions, suspension or revocation of the optometrist's license or 24 if the optometrist or the optometrist's employee is or becomes ineligible to 25 participate in state or federal government-funded programs. 26 (B) Termination of any underlying lease where the optometrist has subleased 27 space, or the optometrist's failure to comply with the underlying lease provisions 28 that are made applicable to the optometrist. 29 (C) If the health plan is the landlord, the termination of the provider agreement 30 between the health plan and the optometrist, in accordance with the Knox-Keene 31 Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975 (Chapter 2.2 (commencing with Section 1340) 32 of Division 2 of the Health and Safety Code). 33 (D) Other reasons pursuant to the terms of the lease or permitted under the Civil 34 Code. 35 (11) The landlord shall act in good faith in terminating the lease and in no case 36 shall the landlord terminate the lease for reasons that constitute interference with 37 the practice of optometry. 38 (12) Lease or rent terms and payments shall not be based on number of eye exams 39 performed, prescriptions written, patient referrals or the sale or promotion of the 40 products of a registered dispensing optician or an optical company. 41 (13) The landlord shall not terminate the lease solely because of a report, 42 complaint, or allegation filed by the optometrist against the landlord, a registered 43 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 26 - dispensing optician or a health plan, to the State Board of Optometry or the 1 Department of Managed Health Care or any law enforcement or regulatory agency. 2 (14) The landlord shall provide the optometrist with written notice of the 3 scheduled expiration date of a lease at least 60 days prior to the scheduled expiration 4 date. This notice obligation shall not affect the ability of either party to terminate 5 the lease pursuant to this section. The landlord may not interfere with an outgoing 6 optometrist's efforts to inform the optometrist's patients, in accordance with 7 customary practice and professional obligations, of the relocation of the 8 optometrist's practice. 9 (15) The State Board of Optometry may inspect, upon request, an individual lease 10 agreement pursuant to its investigational authority, and if such a request is made, 11 the landlord or tenant, as applicable, shall promptly comply with the request. Failure 12 or refusal to comply with the request for lease agreements within 30 days of 13 receiving the request constitutes unprofessional conduct and is grounds for 14 disciplinary action by the appropriate regulatory agency. This section shall not 15 affect the Department of Managed Health Care's authority to inspect all books and 16 records of a health plan pursuant to Section 1381 of the Health and Safety Code. 17 Any financial information contained in the lease submitted to a regulatory entity, 18 pursuant to this paragraph, shall be considered confidential trade secret information 19 that is exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 20 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 Division 10 (commencing with 21 Section 7920.000) of Title 1 of the Government Code). 22 (16) This subdivision shall not be applicable to the relationship between any 23 optometrist employee and the employer medical group, or the relationship between 24 a medical group exclusively contracted with a health plan regulated by the 25 Department of Managed Health Care and that health plan. 26 (e) No registered dispensing optician may have any membership, proprietary 27 interest, coownership, or profit-sharing arrangement either by stock ownership, 28 interlocking directors, trusteeship, mortgage, or trust deed, with an optometrist, 29 except as permitted under this section. 30 (f) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a person licensed under Chapter 5 31 (commencing with Section 2000) or its professional corporation from contracting 32 with or employing optometrists, ophthalmologists, or optometric assistants and 33 entering into a contract or landlord tenant relationship with a health plan, an optical 34 company, or a registered dispensing optician, in accordance with Sections 650 and 35 654 of this code. 36 (g) Any violation of this section constitutes a misdemeanor as to such person 37 licensed under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 3000) of this division and as 38 to any and all persons, whether or not so licensed under this division, who participate 39 with such licensed person in a violation of any provision of this section. 40 (h)(1) Notwithstanding any other law and in addition to any action available to 41 the State Board of Optometry, the State Board of Optometry may issue a citation 42 containing an order of abatement, an order to pay an administrative fine, or both, to 43 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 27 - an optical company, an optometrist, or a registered dispensing optician for a 1 violation of this section. The administrative fine shall not exceed fifty thousand 2 dollars ($50,000) per investigation.

If a hearing is not requested pursuant to 17 this section, payment of any fine shall not constitute an admission of the violation 18 charged. Hearings shall be held pursuant to Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 19 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code. 20 (3) The board shall adopt regulations to implement a system for the issuance of 21 citations, administrative fines, and orders of abatement authorized by this section. 22 The regulations shall include provisions for both of the following: 23 (A) The issuance of a citation without an administrative fine. 24 (B) The opportunity for a cited person or entity to have an informal conference 25 with the executive officer of the board in addition to the hearing described in 26 paragraph (2). 27 (4) The failure of a licensee to pay a fine within 30 days of the date of assessment, 28 unless the citation is being appealed, may result in disciplinary action being taken 29 by the board. Where a citation is not contested and a fine is not paid, the full amount 30 of the assessed fine shall be added to the fee for renewal of the license. A license 31 shall not be renewed without payment of the renewal fee and fine. 32 (5) Notwithstanding any other law, if a fine is paid to satisfy an assessment based 33 on the finding of a violation, payment of the fine shall be represented as satisfactory 34 resolution of the matter for purposes of public disclosure. 35 (i) Administrative fines collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the 36 Dispensing Opticians Fund. It is the intent of the Legislature that moneys collected 37 as fines and deposited in the fund be used by the board primarily for enforcement 38 purposes. 39 Comment.

Section 1947.8 of the Civil Code is amended to read: 6 1947.8. (a) If an ordinance or charter controls or establishes a system of controls 7 on the price at which residential rental units may be offered for rent or lease and 8 requires the registration of rents, the ordinance or charter, or any regulation adopted 9 pursuant thereto, shall provide for the establishment and certification of permissible 10 rent levels for the registered rental units, and any changes thereafter to those rent 11 levels, by the local agency as provided in this section. 12 (b) If the ordinance, charter, or regulation is in effect on January 1, 1987, the 13 ordinance, charter, or regulation shall provide for the establishment and certification 14 of permissible rent levels on or before January 1, 1988, including completion of all 15 appeals and administrative proceedings connected therewith. After July 1, 1990, no 16 local agency may maintain any action to recover excess rent against any property 17 owner who has registered the unit with the local agency within the time limits set 18 forth in this section if the initial certification of permissible rent levels affecting that 19 particular property has not been completed, unless the delay is willfully and 20 intentionally caused by the property owner or is a result of court proceedings or 21 further administrative proceedings ordered by a court. If the ordinance, charter, or 22 regulation is adopted on or after January 1, 1987, the ordinance, charter, or 23 regulation shall provide for the establishment and certification of permissible rent 24 levels within one year after it is adopted, including completion of all appeals and 25 administrative proceedings connected therewith. Upon the request of the landlord 26 or the tenant, the local agency shall provide the landlord and the tenant with a 27 certificate or other documentation reflecting the permissible rent levels of the rental 28 unit. A landlord may request a certificate of permissible rent levels for rental units 29 which that have a base rent established, but which are vacant and not exempt from 30 registration under this section. The landlord or the tenant may appeal the 31 determination of the permissible rent levels reflected in the certificate. The 32 permissible rent levels reflected in the certificate or other documentation shall, in 33 the absence of intentional misrepresentation or fraud, be binding and conclusive 34 upon the local agency unless the determination of the permissible rent levels is being 35 appealed. 36 (c) After the establishment and certification of permissible rent levels under 37 subdivision (b), the local agency shall, upon the request of the landlord or the tenant, 38 provide the landlord and the tenant with a certificate of the permissible rent levels 39 of the rental unit. The certificate shall be issued within five business days from the 40 date of request by the landlord or the tenant. The permissible rent levels reflected in 41 the certificate shall, in the absence of intentional misrepresentation or fraud, be 42 binding and conclusive upon the local agency unless the determination of the 43 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 87 - permissible rent levels is being appealed. The landlord or the tenant may appeal the 1 determination of the permissible rent levels reflected in the certificate. Any appeal 2 of a determination of permissible rent levels as reflected in the certificate, other than 3 an appeal made pursuant to subdivision (b), shall be filed with the local agency 4 within 15 days from issuance of the certificate. The local agency shall notify, in 5 writing, the landlord and the tenant of its decision within 60 days following the 6 filing of the appeal. 7 (d) The local agency may charge the person to whom a certificate is issued a fee 8 in the amount necessary to cover the reasonable costs incurred by the local agency 9 in issuing the certificate. 10 (e) The absence of a certification of permissible rent levels shall not impair, 11 restrict, abridge, or otherwise interfere with either of the following: 12 (1) A judicial or administrative hearing. 13 (2) Any matter in connection with a conveyance of an interest in property. 14 (f) The record of permissible rent levels is a public record for purposes of the 15 California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of 16 Division 7 Division 10 (commencing with Section 7920.000) of Title 1 of the 17 Government Code). 18 (g) Any notice specifying the rents applicable to residential rental units which that 19 is given by an owner to a public entity or tenant in order to comply with Chapter 20 12.75 (commencing with Section 7060) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government 21 Code shall not be considered a registration of rents for purposes of this section. 22 (h) \"Local agency,\" as used in this section, means the public entity responsible 23 for the implementation of the ordinance, charter, or regulation. 24 (i) Nothing in this section shall be construed: 25 (1) To grant to any public entity any power which that it does not possess 26 independent of this section to control or establish a system of control on the price at 27 which accommodations may be offered for rent or lease, or to diminish any such 28 power which that power of this type that the public entity may possess, except as 29 specifically provided in this section. 30 (2) On and after January 1, 2016, to apply to tenancies commencing on or after 31 January 1, 1999, for which the owner of residential property may establish the initial 32 rent under Chapter 2.7 (commencing with Section 1954.50). However, for a tenancy 33 that commenced on or after January 1, 1999, if a property owner has provided the 34 local agency with the tenancy's initial rent in compliance with that agency's 35 registration requirements in a writing signed under penalty of perjury, there shall be 36 a rebuttable presumption that the statement of the initial rent is correct. 37 Comment.

If the person waives 32 the right to a hearing, the department shall issue an order setting liability in the 33 amount proposed in the complaint. If the person has waived the right to a hearing or 34 if the department and the person have entered into a settlement agreement, the order 35 shall be final. 36 (d) Any hearing required under this section shall be conducted by a referee or 37 hearing board according to the procedures specified in Sections 11507 to 11517, 38 inclusive, of the Government Code, except as otherwise provided in this section. In 39 making a determination, the hearing officer may consider the records of the 40 department in the matter, the complaint, and any new facts brought to his or her the 41 officer's attention by that person. The hearing officer shall be the sole trier of fact 42 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 165 - as to the existence of a basis for liability under Section 2582 or 2583. The hearing 1 officer shall make the determination of the facts of the case and shall prepare and 2 submit the proposed decision, including recommended penalty assessment, to the 3 director for his or her the director's review and assistance in the penalty assessment 4 process. 5 (e) The director may assess the civil penalty, and may reduce the amount, or not 6 impose any assessment, of civil penalties based upon the nature, circumstances, 7 extent, and gravity of the prohibited acts alleged, and the degree of culpability of 8 the violator; or the director may enter into a settlement agreement with the person 9 in the best interests of the state or confirm the amount of civil penalties contained 10 in the complaint. If the director reduces the amount of the civil penalty, does not 11 impose the civil penalty, or enters into a settlement agreement, the director shall 12 seek the recommendation of the hearing officer and enter into the records of the case 13 the reasons for that action, including the hearing officer's recommendation. The 14 decision of the director assessing the civil penalty is final. The proposed decision is 15 a public record and shall be served upon the person. The director may approve the 16 proposed decision in its entirety, or the director may reduce the proposed penalty 17 and adopt the balance of the proposed decision. 18 (f) Upon the final assessment of the civil penalty, the department shall issue an 19 order setting the amount of the civil penalty to be imposed. An order setting civil 20 liability under this section becomes effective and final upon the issuance thereof, 21 and payment shall be made within 30 days of issuance.

In all proceedings pursuant to this 29 subdivision, the court shall exercise its independent judgment on the evidence in the 30 whole record. The filing of a petition for a writ of mandate shall not stay any other 31 civil or criminal action. 32 (h) The records of the case, after all appeals are final, are public records, as 33 defined in subdivision (d) of Section 6252 Section 7920.530 of the Government 34 Code. 35 Comment.

The 33 department shall impose per-trap fees on any former trap owner who refuses to pay 34 the recovery fee to the retrieval permitholder. The department shall set the rate of 35 these per-trap fees at a level sufficient to recover any costs to the department from 36 handling noncompliance with the gear retrieval program and to reimburse the 37 retrieval permitholder for the reasonable cost of trap retrieval, storage, and disposal 38 of crab traps belonging to a former owner who refuses to pay the recovery fees for 39 those traps and, upon appropriation by the Legislature, shall use the proceeds of the 40 per-trap fees for these purposes. The department shall annually adjust the per-trap 41 fees pursuant to Section 713. 42 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 167 - (4) Notwithstanding Section 8022, the department may release contact 1 information to a retrieval permitholder for purposes of the retrieval program under 2 terms and conditions as the department deems necessary to preserve the 3 confidentiality of the information released. Any release of information pursuant to 4 this section does not constitute a waiver of any applicable exemptions from 5 disclosure under the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with 6 Section 6250) of Division 7 Division 10 (commencing with Section 7920.000 of 7 Title 1 of the Government Code). 8 (5) The department may deny an application for renewal or transfer of a 9 Dungeness crab vessel permit until the applicant pays any fees imposed pursuant to 10 paragraph (3). 11 (6) The department shall submit the proposed retrieval program developed 12 pursuant to this section to the Dungeness crab task force for review, and shall not 13 implement the retrieval program until the task force has had 60 days or more to 14 review the proposed retrieval program and recommend any proposed changes.

Legislative findings and declarations relating to Western Climate 23 Initiative, Inc. 24 SEC. ___. Section 12894.5 of the Government Code is amended to read: 25 12894.5. (a) The Legislature finds and declares both of the following: 26 (1) California's participation in the Western Climate Initiative, Incorporated, 27 requires that its sole purpose be to provide operational and technical support to 28 California in its implementation of Division 25.5 (commencing with Section 38500) 29 of the Health and Safety Code and to provide support to the greenhouse gas 30 emissions reduction programs of other jurisdictions. Given its limited scope of 31 activities, the Western Climate Initiative, Incorporated, does not have the authority 32 to create policy with respect to any existing or future program or regulation 33 undertaken pursuant to Division 25.5 (commencing with Section 38500) of the 34 Health and Safety Code. 35 (2) The state recognizes the ongoing efforts of the Western Climate Initiative, 36 Incorporated, have resulted in policies that are consistent with the Bagley-Keene 37 Open Meeting Act (Article 9 (commencing with Section 11120) of Chapter 1 of Part 38 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code) and the California Public 39 Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 Division 40 10 (commencing with Section 7920.000) of Title 1 of the Government Code) 1), as 41 well as bylaws that meet the requirements of this section. 42 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 225 - (b) The California membership of the Board of Directors of the Western Climate 1 Initiative, Incorporated, as established pursuant to Section 12894, shall participate 2 on the board so long as the Western Climate Initiative, Incorporated, maintains 3 policies and bylaws according to all of the following: 4 (1) An open meetings policy that is and remains consistent with the general 5 policies of the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act (Article 9 (commencing with 6 Section 11120) of Chapter 1 of Part 1) and affords the public the greatest possible 7 access consistent with the other duties of the Western Climate Initiative, 8 Incorporated. 9 (2) A records availability policy that is and remains consistent with the general 10 policies of the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with 11 Section 6250) of Division 7 Division 10 (commencing with Section 7920.000) of 12 Title 1) and affords the public access to corporate records consistent with the 13 operating needs and other duties of the Western Climate Initiative, Incorporated, 14 and all applicable legal privileges. 15 (3) Bylaws that limit the activities of the Western Climate Initiative, Incorporated, 16 to the technical and operational support of the greenhouse gas emissions reduction 17 programs of California and other jurisdictions. These bylaws shall not allow the 18 Western Climate Initiative, Incorporated, to have policymaking authority with 19 respect to these programs. 20 (c) The State Air Resources Board shall provide notice to the Joint Legislative 21 Budget Committee for all procurements over one hundred fifty thousand dollars 22 ($150,000) proposed by the Western Climate Initiative, Incorporated, that are 23 expected to result in a contract no later than 30 days prior to the execution of those 24 contracts. 25 (d) Commencing January 1, 2014, the State Air Resources Board shall include 26 information on all proposed expenditures and allocations of moneys to the Western 27 Climate Initiative, Incorporated, in the Governor's Budget. 28 Comment. Section 12894.5 is amended to reflect nonsubstantive recodification of the California 29 Public Records Act. See California Public Records Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L. Revision Comm'n 30 Reports __ (2019). 31 The section is also amended to make technical changes. 32 \u00a7 15570.42 (amended). Regulations establishing procedures and guidelines to access public 33 records of Department of Tax and Fee Administration 34 SEC. ___. Section 15570.42 of the Government Code is amended to read: 35 15570.42. Pursuant to Section 6253 Article 1 (commencing with Section 36 7922.630) of Chapter 2 of Part 3 of Division 10 of Title 1, the department shall 37 adopt regulations to establish procedures and guidelines to access public records. 38 These regulations shall facilitate maximum public accessibility to the department's 39 public records. These regulations shall specifically identify and describe the types 40 of public records pertaining to the tax and the fee programs administered by the 41 department. 42 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 226 - Comment. Section 15570.42 is amended to reflect nonsubstantive recodification of the 1 California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\"). See California Public Records Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L. 2 Revision Comm'n Reports __ (2019). 3 The amendment also corrects a cross-reference to \"Section 6253.\" When Section 15570.42 was 4 enacted in 2017, it was apparently modeled on Section 15652. It closely tracked the language of 5 that section, including the cross-reference to \"Section 6253.\" Compare 2017 Cal. Stat. ch. 16, 5 6 with 1998 Cal. Stat. ch. \u00a7 2. However, Section 15652's cross-reference to \"Section 6253\" 7 was obsolete because former Section 6253 was amended and renumbered as Section 6253.4 in 1998 8 (see 1998 Cal. Stat. ch. 620, \u00a7 4; see also Section 15652 Comment). Pursuant to the CPRA 9 Recodification Act of 2020, Section 6253.4 has in turn been repealed and recodified as Article 1 of 10 Chapter 2 of Part 3 of Division 10 of Title 1 (Sections 7922.630-7922.640). That article is now the 11 proper cross-reference to include in Sections 15652 and 15570.42; it contains the CPRA material 12 on adoption of regulations. 13 \u00a7 15650 (amended). \"Public record\" 14 SEC. ___. Section 15650 of the Government Code is amended to read: 15 15650. For purposes of this chapter, \"public record\" means any public record as 16 defined in subdivision (d) of Section 6252 Section 7920.530. 17 Comment. Section 15650 is amended to reflect nonsubstantive recodification of the California 18 Public Records Act. See California Public Records Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L. Revision Comm'n 19 Reports __ (2019). 20 The amendment also corrects a cross-reference to subdivision (d) of former Section 6252, which 21 became obsolete when subdivision (d) was relabeled as subdivision (e). Compare 1998 Cal. Stat. 22 ch. 1049, \u00a7 2 (original version of Section 15650, which cross-refers to \"any public record as defined 23 in subdivision (d) of Section 6252\") with 1994 Cal. Stat. ch. 1010, \u00a7 136 (version of former Section 24 6252 in place when Section 15650 was enacted); see also 1998 Cal. Stat. ch. 620, \u00a7 2 (relabeling 25 definition of \"public records\" as subdivision (e)); 2015 Cal. Stat. ch. 537, \u00a7 20 (version of former 26 Section 6252 repealed by CPRA Recodification Act of 2020); Section 7920.530 (continuing former 6252(e)'s definition of \"public records\"). 28 \u00a7 15652 (amended). Regulations establishing procedures and guidelines to access public 29 records of State Board of Equalization 30 SEC. ___. Section 15652 of the Government Code is amended to read: 31 15652. Pursuant to Section 6253 Article 1 (commencing with Section 7922.630) 32 of Chapter 2 of Part 3 of Division 10 of Title 1, the State Board of Equalization shall 33 adopt regulations to establish procedures and guidelines to access public records. 34 These regulations shall facilitate maximum public accessibility to the board's public 35 records. These regulations shall specifically identify and describe the types of public 36 records pertaining to the tax and the fee programs maintained by the board. 37 Comment. Section 15652 is amended to reflect nonsubstantive recodification of the California 38 Public Records Act (\"CPRA\"). See California Public Records Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L. Revision 39 Comm'n Reports __ (2019). 40 The amendment also corrects a cross-reference to \"Section 6253.\" When Section 15652 was 41 added to the codes by 1998 Cal. Stat. ch. 1049, \u00a7 2, the CPRA material on adoption of regulations 42 was located in former Section 6253 (see Gov. Reorg. Plan No. 1 of 1991, \u00a7 70). Shortly afterwards, 43 former Section 6253 was amended and renumbered as Section 6253.4 (see 1998 Cal. Stat. ch. 620, 44 \u00a7 4, which became operative on Jan. 1, 1999). Pursuant to the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, 45 Section 6253.4 has in turn been repealed and recodified as Article 1 of Chapter 2 of Part 3 of 46 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 227 - Division 10 of Title 1 (Sections 7922.630-7922.640). That article is now the proper cross-reference; 1 it contains the CPRA material on adoption of regulations. 2 \u00a7 15705 (amended). Truncation of social security numbers on lien abstracts and other 3 disclosable records of Franchise Tax Board 4 SEC. ___. Section 15705 of the Government Code is amended to read: 5 15705. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, unless prohibited by federal 6 law, the Franchise Tax Board shall truncate social security numbers on lien abstracts 7 and any other records created by the board that are disclosable under Chapter 3.5 8 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 Division 10 (commencing with 9 Section 7920.000) of Title 1 before disclosing the record to the public. For purposes 10 of this section, \"truncate\" means to redact the first five digits of a social security 11 number. 12 Comment. Section 15705 is amended to reflect nonsubstantive recodification of the California 13 Public Records Act. See California Public Records Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L. Revision Comm'n 14 Reports __ (2019). 15 \u00a7 20057 (amended). \"Public agency\" 16 SEC. ___.

Legislative findings and declarations relating to financial and legal 39 records of California Indian tribes and tribal business enterprises 40 SEC. ___. Section 63048.63 of the Government Code is amended to read: 41 63048.63. (a) The Legislature hereby finds and declares: 42 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 256 - (1) The financial and legal records of California Indian tribes and tribal business 1 enterprises are records of a sovereign nation and are not subject to disclosure by 2 private citizens or the state. This is explicitly recognized in amendments to tribal-3 state gaming compacts ratified by the Legislature, which provide for the 4 securitization of annual payments to be received from the tribes by the state or by 5 an agency, trust, fund, or entity specified by the state. 6 (2) In order to review the records of any Indian tribe relative to this securitization, 7 the compacts require the execution of nondisclosure agreements. 8 (3) State entities statutorily charged with participating in the bond sale cannot 9 perform those duties in the absence of that agreement, and the Legislature hereby 10 acknowledges and agrees that documents containing tribal information are not 11 public records, shall not be discussed in an open meeting, and that state officials 12 privy to that information may execute nondisclosure agreements. 13 (b) Nothing in Chapter 3.5 of Division 7 of Title 1 (commencing with Section 14 6250) Division 10 (commencing with Section 7920.000) of Title 1 or any other 15 provision of law shall permit the disclosure of any records of an Indian tribe received 16 by the state, or by an agency, trust fund, or entity specified by the state, in connection 17 with the sale of any portions of the designated tribal-state gaming compact assets or 18 the issuance of bonds, or any summaries or analyses thereof. The transmission of 19 the records, or the information contained in those records in an alternative form, to 20 the state or the special purpose trust shall not constitute a waiver of exemption from 21 disclosure, and the records and information once transmitted to the state or special 22 purpose trust shall be subject to this same exemption from disclosure. 23 (c) The state and the special purpose trust are authorized to enter into 24 nondisclosure agreements with Indian tribes agreeing not to disclose the materials 25 described in subdivision (b). 26 (d) The nondisclosure agreements may include provisions limiting the 27 representatives of the state and the special purpose trust authorized to review or 28 receive records of the Indian tribe to those individuals directly working on the sale 29 of portions of the designated compact assets or the issuance of the bonds. 30 (e) Nothing in Article 9 (commencing with Section 11120) of Chapter 1 of Part 1 31 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code shall be construed to prevent the 32 bank from conducting a closed session to consider any records or information of an 33 Indian tribe or any summaries or analyses thereof received by the state in connection 34 with the sale of any portion of the compact assets or the issuance of bonds. 35 Comment. Section 63048.63 is amended to reflect nonsubstantive recodification of the 36 California Public Records Act. See California Public Records Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L. Revision 37 Comm'n Reports __ (2019). 38 \u00a7 65913.4 (amended). Streamlined, ministerial approval process for development 39 application 40 SEC. ___. Section 65913.4 of the Government Code is amended to read: 41 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 257 - 65913.4. (a) A development proponent may submit an application for a 1 development that is subject to the streamlined, ministerial approval process 2 provided by subdivision (b) and is not subject to a conditional use permit if the 3 development satisfies all of the following objective planning standards: 4 (1) The development is a multifamily housing development that contains two or 5 more residential units. 6 (2) The development is located on a site that satisfies all of the following: 7 (A) A site that is a legal parcel or parcels located in a city if, and only if, the city 8 boundaries include some portion of either an urbanized area or urban cluster, as 9 designated by the United States Census Bureau, or, for unincorporated areas, a legal 10 parcel or parcels wholly within the boundaries of an urbanized area or urban cluster, 11 as designated by the United States Census Bureau. 12 (B) A site in which at least 75 percent of the perimeter of the site adjoins parcels 13 that are developed with urban uses. For the purposes of this section, parcels that are 14 only separated by a street or highway shall be considered to be adjoined. 15 (C) A site that is zoned for residential use or residential mixed-use development, 16 or has a general plan designation that allows residential use or a mix of residential 17 and nonresidential uses, with at least two-thirds of the square footage of the 18 development designated for residential use. Additional density, floor area, and units, 19 and any other concession, incentive, or waiver of development standards granted 20 pursuant to the Density Bonus Law in Section 65915 shall be included in the square 21 footage calculation. The square footage of the development shall not include 22 underground space, such as basements or underground parking garages. 23 (3)(A) The development proponent has committed to record, prior to the issuance 24 of the first building permit, a land use restriction or covenant providing that any 25 lower or moderate income housing units required pursuant to subparagraph (B) of 26 paragraph (4) shall remain available at affordable housing costs or rent to persons 27 and families of lower or moderate income for no less than the following periods of 28 time: 29 (i) Fifty-five years for units that are rented. 30 (ii) Forty-five years for units that are owned. 31 (B) The city or county shall require the recording of covenants or restrictions 32 implementing this paragraph for each parcel or unit of real property included in the 33 development. 34 (4) The development satisfies subparagraphs (A) and (B) below: 35 (A) Is located in a locality that the department has determined is subject to this 36 subparagraph on the basis that the number of units that have been issued building 37 permits, as shown on the most recent production report received by the department, 38 is less than the locality's share of the regional housing needs, by income category, 39 for that reporting period. A locality shall remain eligible under this subparagraph 40 until the department's determination for the next reporting period. 41 (B) The development is subject to a requirement mandating a minimum 42 percentage of below market rate housing based on one of the following: 43 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 258 - (i) The locality did not submit its latest production report to the department by the 1 time period required by Section 65400, or that production report reflects that there 2 were fewer units of above moderate-income housing issued building permits than 3 were required for the regional housing needs assessment cycle for that reporting 4 period. In addition, if the project contains more than 10 units of housing, the project 5 does either of the following: 6 (I) The project dedicates a minimum of 10 percent of the total number of units to 7 housing affordable to households making at or below 80 percent of the area median 8 income. However, if the locality has adopted a local ordinance that requires that 9 greater than 10 percent of the units be dedicated to housing affordable to households 10 making below 80 percent of the area median income, that local ordinance applies. 11 (II)(ia) If the project is located within the San Francisco Bay area, the project, in 12 lieu of complying with subclause (I), dedicates 20 percent of the total number of 13 units to housing affordable to households making below 120 percent of the area 14 median income with the average income of the units at or below 100 percent of the 15 area median income. However, a local ordinance adopted by the locality applies if 16 it requires greater than 20 percent of the units be dedicated to housing affordable to 17 households making at or below 120 percent of the area median income, or requires 18 that any of the units be dedicated at a level deeper than 120 percent. In order to 19 comply with this subclause, the rent or sale price charged for units that are dedicated 20 to housing affordable to households between 80 percent and 120 percent of the area 21 median income shall not exceed 30 percent of the gross income of the household. 22 (ib) For purposes of this subclause, \"San Francisco Bay area\" means the entire 23 area within the territorial boundaries of the Counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, 24 Marin, Napa, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma, and the City and County 25 of San Francisco. 26 (ii) The locality's latest production report reflects that there were fewer units of 27 housing issued building permits affordable to either very low income or low-income 28 households by income category than were required for the regional housing needs 29 assessment cycle for that reporting period, and the project seeking approval 30 dedicates 50 percent of the total number of units to housing affordable to households 31 making at or below 80 percent of the area median income. However, if the locality 32 has adopted a local ordinance that requires that greater than 50 percent of the units 33 be dedicated to housing affordable to households making at or below 80 percent of 34 the area median income, that local ordinance applies. 35 (iii) The locality did not submit its latest production report to the department by 36 the time period required by Section 65400, or if the production report reflects that 37 there were fewer units of housing affordable to both income levels described in 38 clauses (i) and (ii) that were issued building permits than were required for the 39 regional housing needs assessment cycle for that reporting period, the project 40 seeking approval may choose between utilizing clause (i) or (ii). 41 (C)(i) A development proponent that uses a unit of affordable housing to satisfy 42 the requirements of subparagraph (B) may also satisfy any other local or state 43 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 259 - requirement for affordable housing, including local ordinances or the Density Bonus 1 Law in Section 65915, provided that the development proponent complies with the 2 applicable requirements in the state or local law. 3 (ii) A development proponent that uses a unit of affordable housing to satisfy any 4 other state or local affordability requirement may also satisfy the requirements of 5 subparagraph (B), provided that the development proponent complies with 6 applicable requirements of subparagraph (B). 7 (iii) A development proponent may satisfy the affordability requirements of 8 subparagraph (B) with a unit that is restricted to households with incomes lower 9 than the applicable income limits required in subparagraph (B). 10 (5) The development, excluding any additional density or any other concessions, 11 incentives, or waivers of development standards granted pursuant to the Density 12 Bonus Law in Section 65915, is consistent with objective zoning standards, 13 objective subdivision standards, and objective design review standards in effect at 14 the time that the development is submitted to the local government pursuant to this 15 section.

Revision Comm'n 30 Reports __ (2019). 31 The amendment also corrects a cross-reference to \"Section 6257.\" That cross-reference became 32 obsolete when former Section 6257 (1981 Cal. Stat. ch. 968, \u00a7 3.5) was repealed by 1998 Cal. Stat. 33 ch. 620, \u00a7 10. At that time, the substance of former Section 6257 was relocated to newly-added 34 Section 6253 (see 1998 Cal. Stat. ch. 620, \u00a7 5). Pursuant to the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, 35 Section 6253 has in turn been repealed and recodified; the fee-related material from former Section 36 6257 is now located in Section 7922.530(a). 37 The section is also amended to make a grammatical correction. 38 \u00a7 66201 (amended).

If the approving authority approves the application, then 9 for those portions of the project that are not a public work all of the following shall 10 apply: 11 (I) The applicant shall include the prevailing wage requirement in all contracts for 12 the performance of the work. 13 (II) All contractors and subcontractors shall pay to all construction workers 14 employed in the execution of the work at least the general prevailing rate of per 15 diem wages, except that apprentices registered in programs approved by the Chief 16 of the Division of Apprenticeship Standards may be paid at least the applicable 17 apprentice prevailing rate. 18 (III) Except as provided in subclause (V), all contractors and subcontractors shall 19 maintain and verify payroll records pursuant to Section 1776 of the Labor Code and 20 make those records available for inspection and copying as provided in therein. 21 (IV) Except as provided in subclause (V), the obligation of the contractors and 22 subcontractors to pay prevailing wages may be enforced by the Labor 23 Commissioner through the issuance of a civil wage and penalty assessment pursuant 24 to Section 1741 of the Labor Code, which may be reviewed pursuant to Section 25 1742 of the Labor Code, within 18 months after the completion of the project, by an 26 underpaid worker through an administrative complaint or civil action, or by a joint 27 labor-management committee through a civil action under Section 1771.2 of the 28 Labor Code.

An applicant that fails to provide a monthly 43 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 274 - report demonstrating compliance with Chapter 2.9 (commencing with Section 2600) 1 of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Public Contract Code is subject to a civil penalty of 2 ten thousand dollars ($10,000) per month for each month for which the report has 3 not been provided. Any contractor or subcontractor that fails to use a skilled and 4 trained workforce is subject to a civil penalty of two hundred dollars ($200) per day 5 for each worker employed in contravention of the skilled and trained workforce 6 requirement. Penalties may be assessed by the Labor Commissioner within 18 7 months of completion of the project using the same procedures for issuance of civil 8 wage and penalty assessments pursuant to Section 1741 of the Labor Code, and may 9 be reviewed pursuant to the same procedures in Section 1742 of the Labor Code. 10 Penalties shall be paid to the State Public Works Enforcement Fund. 11 (IV) Subclause (III) does not apply if all contractors and subcontractors 12 performing work on the project are subject to a project labor agreement that requires 13 compliance with the skilled and trained workforce requirement and provides for 14 enforcement of that obligation through an arbitration procedure. For purposes of this 15 subparagraph, \"project labor agreement\" has the same meaning as set forth in 16 paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 2500 of the Public Contract Code. 17 (C) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (B), a project within a housing 18 sustainability district that is subject to approval by the approving authority is exempt 19 from any requirement to pay prevailing wages or use a skilled and trained workforce 20 if it meets both of the following: 21 (i) The project includes 10 or fewer units. 22 (ii) The project is not a public work for purposes of Chapter 1 (commencing with 23 Section 1720) of Part 7 of Division 2 of the Labor Code. 24 (5) Provide that a project is not eligible for approval from the approving authority 25 if it involved or involves a subdivision that is, or, notwithstanding this chapter, 26 would otherwise be, subject to the Subdivision Map Act (Division 2 (commencing 27 with Section 66410)) or any other applicable law authorizing the subdivision of 28 land, unless either of the following apply: 29 (A) The project has received or will receive financing or funding by means of a 30 low-income housing tax credit and is subject to the requirement that prevailing 31 wages be paid pursuant to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (4). 32 (B) The project is subject to the requirement that prevailing wages be paid, and a 33 skilled and trained workforce used, pursuant to paragraph (4). 34 (6) Provide for relocation assistance for persons and families displaced from their 35 residences due to development within the housing sustainability district. 36 (g) A housing sustainability district ordinance adopted pursuant to this section 37 shall remain in effect for no more than 10 years, except that the city, county, or city 38 and county may renew the housing sustainability district ordinance, for an additional 39 period not exceeding 10 years, before the date upon which it would otherwise be 40 repealed pursuant to this subdivision. 41 (h) This section shall not be construed to affect the authority of a city, county, or 42 city and county to amend its zoning regulations pursuant to Chapter 4 (commencing 43 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 275 - with Section 65800), except to the extent that an amendment affects a housing 1 sustainability district. 2 (i) The city, county, or city and county shall comply with Chapter 4.3 3 (commencing with Section 21155.10) of Division 13 of the Public Resources Code. 4 Comment.

Transfer of governance of Alameda Health System 34 SEC. ___. Section 101850 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read: 35 101850. The Legislature finds and declares the following: 36 (a)(1) Due to the challenges facing the Alameda Health System arising from 37 changes in the public and private health industries, the Alameda County Board of 38 Supervisors has determined that a transfer of governance of the Alameda Health 39 System to an independent governing body, a hospital authority, is needed to improve 40 the efficiency, effectiveness, and economy of the community health services 41 provided at the medical center. The board of supervisors has further determined that 42 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 351 - the creation of an independent hospital authority strictly and exclusively dedicated 1 to the management, administration, and control of the medical center, in a manner 2 consistent with the county's obligations under Section 17000 of the Welfare and 3 Institutions Code, is the best way to fulfill its commitment to the medically indigent, 4 special needs, and general populations of Alameda County. To accomplish this, it 5 is necessary that the board of supervisors be given authority to create a hospital 6 authority. Because there is no general law under which this authority could be 7 formed, the adoption of a special act and the formation of a special authority is 8 required. 9 (2) The following definitions apply for purposes of this section: 10 (A) \"The county\" means the County of Alameda. 11 (B) \"Governing board\" means the governing body of the hospital authority. 12 (C) \"Hospital authority\" means the separate public agency established by the 13 Board of Supervisors of Alameda County to manage, administer, and control the 14 Alameda Health System. 15 (D) \"Medical center\" means the Alameda Health System, which was formerly 16 known as the Alameda County Medical Center. 17 (b) The board of supervisors of the county may, by ordinance, establish a hospital 18 authority separate and apart from the county for the purpose of effecting a transfer 19 of the management, administration, and control of the medical center in accordance 20 with Section 14000.2 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. A hospital authority 21 established pursuant to this chapter shall be strictly and exclusively dedicated to the 22 management, administration, and control of the medical center within parameters 23 set forth in this chapter, and in the ordinance, bylaws, and contracts adopted by the 24 board of supervisors that shall not be in conflict with this chapter, Section 1442.5 of 25 this code, or Section 17000 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. 26 (c) A hospital authority established pursuant to this chapter shall be governed by 27 a board that is appointed, both initially and continually, by the Board of Supervisors 28 of the County of Alameda. This hospital authority governing board shall reflect both 29 the expertise necessary to maximize the quality and scope of care at the medical 30 center in a fiscally responsible manner and the diverse interest that the medical 31 center serves. The enabling ordinance shall specify the membership of the hospital 32 authority governing board, the qualifications for individual members, the manner of 33 appointment, selection, or removal of governing board members, their terms of 34 office, and all other matters that the board of supervisors deems necessary or 35 convenient for the conduct of the hospital authority's activities. 36 (d) The mission of the hospital authority shall be the management, administration, 37 and other control, as determined by the board of supervisors, of the group of public 38 hospitals, clinics, and programs that comprise the medical center, in a manner that 39 ensures appropriate, quality, and cost-effective medical care as required of counties 40 by Section 17000 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, and, to the extent feasible, 41 other populations, including special populations in the County of Alameda. 42 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 352 - (e) The board of supervisors shall adopt bylaws for the medical center that set 1 forth those matters related to the operation of the medical center by the hospital 2 authority that the board of supervisors deems necessary and appropriate. The bylaws 3 shall become operative upon approval by a majority vote of the board of supervisors. 4 Changes or amendments to the bylaws shall be by majority vote of the board of 5 supervisors. 6 (f) The hospital authority created and appointed pursuant to this section is a duly 7 constituted governing body within the meaning of Section 1250 of this code and 8 Section 70035 of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations as currently written 9 or subsequently amended. 10 (g) Unless otherwise provided by the board of supervisors by way of resolution, 11 the hospital authority may, or the board of supervisors may on behalf of the hospital 12 authority, apply as a public agency for one or more licenses for the provision of 13 health care pursuant to statutes and regulations governing licensing as currently 14 written or subsequently amended. 15 (h) In the event of a change of license ownership, the governing body of the 16 hospital authority shall comply with the obligations of governing bodies of general 17 acute care hospitals generally, as set forth in Section 70701 of Title 22 of the 18 California Code of Regulations, as currently written or subsequently amended, as 19 well as the terms and conditions of the license. The hospital authority is the 20 responsible party with respect to compliance with these obligations, terms, and 21 conditions. 22 (i)(1) A transfer by the county to the hospital authority of the administration, 23 management, and control of the medical center, whether or not the transfer includes 24 the surrendering by the county of the existing general acute care hospital license and 25 corresponding application for a change of ownership of the license, does not affect 26 the eligibility of the county, or in the case of a change of license ownership, the 27 hospital authority, to do any of the following: 28 (A) Participate in, and receive allocations pursuant to, the California Healthcare 29 for the Indigents Program (CHIP). 30 (B) Receive appropriations from the Medi-Cal Inpatient Payment Adjustment 31 Fund without relieving the county of its obligation to make intergovernmental 32 transfer payments related to the Medi-Cal Inpatient Payment Adjustment Fund 33 pursuant to Section 14163 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. 34 (C) Receive Medi-Cal capital supplements pursuant to Section 14085.5 of the 35 Welfare and Institutions Code. 36 (D) Receive any other funds that would otherwise be available to a county 37 hospital. 38 (2) A transfer described in paragraph (1) does not otherwise disqualify the county, 39 or in the case of a change in license ownership, the hospital authority, from 40 participating in any of the following: 41 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 353 - (A) Other funding sources either specific to county hospitals or county 1 ambulatory care clinics or for which there are special provisions specific to county 2 hospitals or to county ambulatory care clinics. 3 (B) Funding programs in which the county, on behalf of the medical center and 4 the Alameda County Health Care Services Agency, had participated prior to the 5 creation of the hospital authority, or would otherwise be qualified to participate in 6 had the hospital authority not been created, and administration, management, and 7 control not been transferred by the county to the hospital authority, pursuant to this 8 chapter. 9 (j) A hospital authority created pursuant to this chapter shall be a legal entity 10 separate and apart from the county and shall file the statement required by Section 11 53051 of the Government Code.

A lease agreement or other 16 agreement between the county and the hospital authority shall provide that county 17 premises shall not be sublet without the approval of the board of supervisors. 18 (p) The statutory authority of a board of supervisors to prescribe rules that 19 authorize a county hospital to integrate its services with those of other hospitals into 20 a system of community service that offers free choice of hospitals to those requiring 21 hospital care, as set forth in Section 14000.2 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, 22 shall apply to the hospital authority upon a transfer of maintenance, operation, and 23 management or ownership of the medical center by the county to the hospital 24 authority. 25 (q) The hospital authority may acquire and possess real or personal property and 26 may dispose of real or personal property other than that owned by the county, as 27 may be necessary for the performance of its functions.

Prior to entering 36 into a contract for any of those services, the authority shall negotiate with the 37 representative of the recognized collective bargaining unit of its physician and 38 surgeon employees over the decision to privatize and, if unable to resolve any 39 dispute through negotiations, shall submit the matter to final binding arbitration. 40 (r) An agreement between the county and the hospital authority shall provide that 41 all existing services provided by the medical center shall continue to be provided to 42 the county through the medical center subject to the policy of the county and 43 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 355 - consistent with the county's obligations under Section 17000 of the Welfare and 1 Institutions Code. 2 (s) A hospital authority to which the maintenance, operation, and management or 3 ownership of the medical center is transferred shall be a \"district\" within the 4 meaning set forth in the County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 (Chapter 3 5 (commencing with Section 31450) of Part 3 of Division 4 of Title 3 of the 6 Government Code). Employees of a hospital authority are eligible to participate in 7 the County Employees Retirement System to the extent permitted by law, except as 8 described in Section 101851. 9 (t) Members of the governing board of the hospital authority shall not be 10 vicariously liable for injuries caused by the act or omission of the hospital authority 11 to the extent that protection applies to members of governing boards of local public 12 entities generally under Section 820.9 of the Government Code. 13 (u) The hospital authority shall be a public agency subject to the Meyers-Milias-14 Brown Act (Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 3500) of Division 4 of Title 1 of 15 the Government Code). 16 (v) Any transfer of functions from county employee classifications to a hospital 17 authority established pursuant to this section shall result in the recognition by the 18 hospital authority of the employee organization that represented the classifications 19 performing those functions at the time of the transfer. 20 (w)(1) In exercising its powers to employ personnel, as set forth in subdivision 21 (p), the hospital authority shall implement, and the board of supervisors shall adopt, 22 a personnel transition plan.

389 - (1) The ICOC shall establish standards that require that all grants and loan awards 1 be subject to intellectual property agreements that balance the opportunity of the 2 State of California to benefit from the patents, royalties, and licenses that result from 3 basic research, therapy development, and clinical trials with the need to ensure that 4 essential medical research is not unreasonably hindered by the intellectual property 5 agreements. All revenues received through the intellectual property agreements 6 established pursuant to this subdivision shall be deposited into the General Fund. 7 (2) These standards shall include, at a minimum, a requirement that CIRM 8 grantees, other than loan recipients and facilities grant recipients, share a fraction of 9 the revenue they receive from licensing or self-commercializing an invention or 10 technology that arises from research funded by CIRM, as set forth below. All 11 revenues received pursuant to this paragraph or regulations adopted to implement 12 this paragraph shall be deposited in the General Fund for use consistent with Section 13 202(c)(7) of Title 35 of the United States Code, if applicable. 14 (A)(i) A grantee that licenses an invention or technology that arises from research 15 funded by CIRM shall pay 25 percent of the revenues it receives in excess of five 16 hundred thousand dollars ($500,000), in the aggregate, to the General Fund. The 17 threshold amount of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) shall be adjusted 18 annually by a multiple of a fraction, the denominator of which is the Consumer Price 19 Index, All Urban Consumers, All Items (San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose; 1982-20 84=100) as prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States 21 Department of Labor and published for the month of October 2009, and the 22 numerator of which is that index published for the month in which the grantee 23 accepts the grant. 24 (ii) If funding sources other than CIRM directly contributed to the development 25 of the invention or technology, then the return to the General Fund shall be 26 calculated as follows: The amount of CIRM funding for the invention or technology 27 shall be divided by the total of funding provided by all sources, and that fraction 28 shall be multiplied by 25. That numeral is the percentage due to the General Fund. 29 (B)(i) A grantee that self-commercializes a product that results from an invention 30 or technology that arises from research funded by CIRM shall pay an amount to the 31 General Fund equal to three times the total amount of the CIRM grant or grants 32 received by the grantee in support of the research that contributed to the creation of 33 the product. The rate of payback of the royalty shall be at a rate of 3 percent of the 34 annual net revenue received by the grantee from the product. 35 (ii) In addition to the payment required by clause (i), the first time that net 36 commercial revenues earned by the grantee from the product exceed two hundred 37 fifty million dollars ($250,000,000) in a calendar year, the grantee shall make a one-38 time payment to the General Fund equal to three times the total amount of the grant 39 or grants awarded by CIRM to the grantee in support of the research that contributed 40 to the creation of the product. 41 (iii) In addition to the payments required by clauses (i) and (ii), the first time that 42 net commercial revenues earned by the grantee from the product exceed five 43 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 390 - hundred million dollars ($500,000,000) in a calendar year, the grantee shall make 1 an additional one-time payment to the General Fund equal to three times the total 2 amount of the grant or grants awarded by CIRM to the grantee in support of the 3 research that contributed to the creation of the product. 4 (iv) In addition to the payments required by clauses (i), (ii), and (iii), the first time 5 that net commercial revenues earned by the grantee from the product equal or 6 exceed five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000) in a calendar year, the grantee 7 shall pay the General Fund 1 percent annually of net commercial revenue in excess 8 of five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000) for the life of any patent covering 9 the invention or technology, if the grantee patented its invention or technology and 10 received a CIRM grant or grants amounting to more than five million dollars 11 ($5,000,000) in support of the research that contributed to the creation of the 12 product. 13 (3) The ICOC shall have the authority to adopt regulations to implement this 14 subdivision. The ICOC shall also have the authority to modify the formulas 15 specified in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2) through regulations if the 16 ICOC determines pursuant to paragraph (1) that a modification is required either in 17 order to ensure that essential medical research, including, but not limited to, therapy 18 development and the broad delivery of therapies to patients, is not unreasonably 19 hindered, or to ensure that the State of California has an opportunity to benefit from 20 the patents, royalties, and licenses that result from basic research, therapy 21 development, and clinical trials. The ICOC shall notify the appropriate fiscal and 22 policy committees of the Legislature 10 calendar days before exercising its authority 23 to vote on the modification of the formulas specified in subparagraphs (A) and (B) 24 of paragraph (2). 25 (k) Preference for California Suppliers 26 The ICOC shall establish standards to ensure that grantees purchase goods and 27 services from California suppliers to the extent reasonably possible, in a good faith 28 effort to achieve a goal of more than 50 percent of such purchases from California 29 suppliers. 30 Comment. Section 125290.30 is amended to reflect nonsubstantive recodification of the 31 California Public Records Act. See California Public Records Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L. Revision 32 Comm'n Reports __ (2019). 33 Note. Health and Safety Code Section 125290.30 was added to the codes in 2004 by an initiative 34 measure, the California Stem Cell Research and Cures Act (Prop. 71, approved Nov. 2, 2004, \u00a7 5.) 35 The California Constitution limits the Legislature's ability to \"amend\" such a statute. See Cal. 36 Const. art. II, \u00a7 10; see also Prop. 71, approved Nov. 2, 2004, \u00a7 8 (specifying special requirements 37 for \"amending\" Prop. 71). 38 In this context, the term \"amend\" does not appear to include a purely technical, nonsubstantive 39 revision like the one proposed above. See, e.g., People v. Kelly, 47 Cal. 4th 1008, 1025, 222 P.3d 40 186, 103 Cal.

The working group members' terms shall 16 be six years except that, after the first six-year terms, the members' terms will be 17 staggered so that one-third of the members shall be elected for a term that expires 18 two years later, one-third of the members shall be elected for a term that expires 19 four years later, and one-third of the members shall be elected for a term that expires 20 six years later. Subsequent terms are for six years. Working group members may 21 serve a maximum of two consecutive terms. 22 (c) Working Group Meetings 23 Each scientific and medical working group shall hold at least four meetings per 24 year, one of which shall be designated as its annual meeting. 25 (d) Working Group Recommendations to the ICOC 26 Recommendations of each of the working groups may be forwarded to the ICOC 27 only by a vote of a majority of a quorum of the members of each working group. If 28 35 percent of the members of any working group join together in a minority position, 29 a minority report may be submitted to the ICOC. The ICOC shall consider the 30 recommendations of the working groups in making its decisions on applications for 31 research and facility grants and loan awards and in adopting regulatory standards. 32 Each working group shall recommend to ICOC rules, procedures, and practices for 33 that working group. 34 (e) Conflict of Interest 35 (1) The ICOC shall adopt conflict of interest rules, based on standards applicable 36 to members of scientific review committees of the National Institutes of Health, to 37 govern the participation of non-ICOC working group members. 38 (2) The ICOC shall appoint an ethics officer from among the staff of the institute. 39 (3) Because the working groups are purely advisory and have no final 40 decisionmaking authority, members of the working groups shall not be considered 41 public officials, employees, or consultants for purposes of the Political Reform Act 42 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 392 - (Title 9 (commencing with Section 81000) of the Government Code), Sections 1090 1 and 19990 of the Government Code, and Sections 10516 and 10517 of the Public 2 Contract Code. 3 (f) Working Group Records 4 All records of the working groups submitted as part of the working groups' 5 recommendations to the ICOC for approval shall be subject to the Public Records 6 Act. Except as provided in this subdivision, the working groups shall not be subject 7 to the provisions of Article 9 (commencing with Section 11120) of Chapter 1 of Part 8 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, or Article 1 (commencing with 9 Section 6250) of Chapter 3.5 of Division 7 Division 10 (commencing with Section 10 7920.000) of Title 1 of the Government Code. 11 Comment.

General acute care hospital building that poses potential risk of 1 collapse or significant loss of life 2 SEC. ___. Section 130060 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read: 3 130060. (a)(1) After January 1, 2008, a general acute care hospital building that 4 is determined to be a potential risk of collapse or pose significant loss of life shall 5 only be used for nonacute care hospital purposes, unless an extension of this 6 deadline has been granted and either of the following occurs before the end of the 7 extension: 8 (A) A replacement building has been constructed and a certificate of occupancy 9 has been granted by the office for the replacement building. 10 (B) A retrofit has been performed on the building and a construction final has 11 been obtained by the office. 12 (2) An extension of the deadline may be granted by the office upon a 13 demonstration by the owner that compliance will result in a loss of health care 14 capacity that may not be provided by other general acute care hospitals within a 15 reasonable proximity. In its request for an extension of the deadline, a hospital shall 16 state why the hospital is unable to comply with the January 1, 2008, deadline 17 requirement. 18 (3) Prior to granting an extension of the January 1, 2008, deadline pursuant to this 19 section, the office shall do all of the following: 20 (A) Provide public notice of a hospital's request for an extension of the deadline. 21 The notice, at a minimum, shall be posted on the office's Internet Web site internet 22 website, and shall include the facility's name and identification number, the status 23 of the request, and the beginning and ending dates of the comment period, and shall 24 advise the public of the opportunity to submit public comments pursuant to 25 subparagraph (C).

Section 922.41 of the Insurance Code is amended to read: 26 922.41. (a) Credit shall be allowed a domestic insurer when the reinsurance is 27 ceded to an assuming insurer that has been certified by the commissioner as a 28 reinsurer in this state and secures its obligations in accordance with this section. 29 Credit shall be allowed at all times for which statutory financial statement credit for 30 reinsurance is claimed under this section. The credit allowed shall be based upon 31 the security held by or on behalf of the ceding insurer in accordance with a rating 32 assigned to the certified reinsurer by the commissioner. The security shall be in a 33 form consistent with this section, any regulations promulgated by the commissioner, 34 and Section 922.5. 35 (b) In order to be eligible for certification, the assuming insurer shall meet the 36 following requirements: 37 (1) The assuming insurer shall be domiciled and licensed to transact insurance or 38 reinsurance in a qualified jurisdiction, as determined by the commissioner pursuant 39 to subdivisions (f) and (g). 40 (2) The assuming insurer shall maintain minimum capital and surplus, or its 41 equivalent, in an amount to be determined by the commissioner, but no less than 42 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 415 - two hundred fifty million dollars ($250,000,000) calculated in accordance with 1 paragraph (4) of subdivision (f) of this section or Section 922.5. This requirement 2 may also be satisfied by an association including incorporated and individual 3 unincorporated underwriters having minimum capital and surplus equivalents (net 4 of liabilities) of at least two hundred fifty million dollars ($250,000,000) and a 5 central fund containing a balance of at least two hundred fifty million dollars 6 ($250,000,000). 7 (3) The assuming insurer shall maintain financial strength ratings from two or 8 more rating agencies deemed acceptable by the commissioner. These ratings shall 9 be based on interactive communication between the rating agency and the assuming 10 insurer and shall not be based solely on publicly available information. These 11 financial strength ratings will be one factor used by the commissioner in 12 determining the rating that is assigned to the assuming insurer. Acceptable rating 13 agencies include the following: 14 (A) Standard & Poor's. 15 (B) Moody's Investors Service. 16 (C) Fitch Ratings. 17 (D) A.M.

The commissioner shall determine the appropriate process for 38 evaluating the qualifications of those jurisdictions. Before its listing, a qualified 39 jurisdiction shall agree in writing to share information and cooperate with the 40 commissioner with respect to all certified reinsurers domiciled within that 41 jurisdiction.

The commissioner 21 shall receive prior notice from a certified reinsurer that proposes participation by 22 the certified reinsurer in a solvent scheme of arrangement. 23 (K) Any other information deemed relevant by the commissioner. 24 (2) Based on the analysis conducted under subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1) of a 25 certified reinsurer's reputation for prompt payment of claims, the commissioner 26 may make appropriate adjustments in the security the certified reinsurer is required 27 to post to protect its liabilities to United States ceding insurers, provided that the 28 commissioner shall, at a minimum, increase the security the certified reinsurer is 29 required to post by one rating level under regulations promulgated by the 30 commissioner, if the commissioner finds either of the following: 31 (A) More than 15 percent of the certified reinsurer's ceding insurance clients have 32 overdue reinsurance recoverables on paid losses of 90 days or more that are not in 33 dispute and that exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) for each ceding 34 insurer. 35 (B) The aggregate amount of reinsurance recoverables on paid losses that are not 36 in dispute and that are overdue by 90 days or more exceeds fifty million dollars 37 ($50,000,000). 38 (3) The assuming insurer shall submit a properly executed Form CR-1, as 39 published on the department's internet website, as evidence of its submission to the 40 jurisdiction of this state, appointment of the commissioner as an agent for service of 41 process in this state, and agreement to provide security for 100 percent of the 42 assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States 43 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 421 - ceding insurers if it resists enforcement of a final United States judgment. The 1 commissioner shall not certify an assuming insurer that is domiciled in a jurisdiction 2 that the commissioner has determined does not adequately and promptly enforce 3 final United States judgments or arbitration awards. 4 (4)(A) In the case of a downgrade by a rating agency or other disqualifying 5 circumstance, the commissioner shall, upon written notice, assign a new rating to 6 the certified reinsurer in accordance with the requirements of this subdivision. 7 (B) The commissioner shall have the authority to suspend, revoke, or otherwise 8 modify a certified reinsurer's certification at any time if the certified reinsurer fails 9 to meet its obligations or security requirements under this section, or if other 10 financial or operating results of the certified reinsurer, or documented significant 11 delays in payment by the certified reinsurer, lead the commissioner to reconsider 12 the certified reinsurer's ability or willingness to meet its contractual obligations. 13 (C) If the rating of a certified reinsurer is upgraded by the commissioner, the 14 certified reinsurer may meet the security requirements applicable to its new rating 15 on a prospective basis, but the commissioner shall require the certified reinsurer to 16 post security under the previously applicable security requirements as to all 17 contracts in force on or before the effective date of the upgraded rating. If the rating 18 of a certified reinsurer is downgraded by the commissioner, the commissioner shall 19 require the certified reinsurer to meet the security requirements applicable to its new 20 rating for all business it has assumed as a certified reinsurer. 21 (D) Upon revocation of the certification of a certified reinsurer by the 22 commissioner, the assuming insurer shall be required to post security in accordance 23 with Section 922.5 in order for the ceding insurer to continue to take credit for 24 reinsurance ceded to the assuming insurer. If funds continue to be held in trust in 25 accordance with subdivision (d) of Section 922.4, the commissioner may allow 26 additional credit equal to the ceding insurer's pro rata share of those funds, 27 discounted to reflect the risk of uncollectibility and anticipated expenses of trust 28 administration. Notwithstanding the change of a certified reinsurer's rating or 29 revocation of its certification, a domestic insurer that has ceded reinsurance to that 30 certified reinsurer shall not be denied credit for reinsurance for a period of three 31 months for all reinsurance ceded to that certified reinsurer, unless the reinsurance is 32 found by the commissioner to be at high risk of uncollectibility. 33 (i) A certified reinsurer shall secure obligations assumed from United States 34 ceding insurers under this subdivision at a level consistent with its rating. The 35 amount of security required in order for full credit to be allowed shall correspond 36 with the following requirements: 37 Ratings security required 38 Secure - 1: 0 percent 39 Secure - 2: 10 percent 40 Secure - 3: 20 percent 41 Secure - 4: 50 percent 42 Secure - 5: 75 percent 43 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 422 - Vulnerable - 6: 100 percent 1 (1) In order for a domestic ceding insurer to qualify for full financial statement 2 credit for reinsurance ceded to a certified reinsurer, the certified reinsurer shall 3 maintain security in a form acceptable to the commissioner and consistent with 4 Section 922.5, or in a multibeneficiary trust in accordance with subdivision (d) of 5 Section 922.4, except as otherwise provided in this subdivision. In order for a 6 domestic insurer to qualify for full financial statement credit, reinsurance contracts 7 entered into or renewed under this section shall include a proper funding clause that 8 requires the certified reinsurer to provide and maintain security in an amount 9 sufficient to avoid the imposition of a financial statement penalty on the ceding 10 insurer under this section for reinsurance ceded to the certified reinsurer. 11 (2) If a certified reinsurer maintains a trust to fully secure its obligations subject 12 to subdivision (d) of Section 922.4, and chooses to secure its obligations incurred 13 as a certified reinsurer in the form of a multibeneficiary trust, the certified reinsurer 14 shall maintain separate trust accounts for its obligations incurred under reinsurance 15 agreements issued or renewed as a certified reinsurer with reduced security as 16 permitted by this subdivision or comparable laws of other United States jurisdictions 17 and for its obligations subject to subdivision (d) of Section 922.4. It shall be a 18 condition to the grant of certification under this section that the certified reinsurer 19 shall have bound itself, by the language of the trust and agreement with the 20 commissioner with principal regulatory oversight of each of those trust accounts, to 21 fund, upon termination of any of those trust accounts, out of the remaining surplus 22 of those trusts any deficiency of any other of those trust accounts. 23 (3) The minimum trusteed surplus requirements provided in subdivision (d) of 24 Section 922.4 are not applicable with respect to a multibeneficiary trust maintained 25 by a certified reinsurer for the purpose of securing obligations incurred under this 26 subdivision, except that the trust shall maintain a minimum trusteed surplus of ten 27 million dollars ($10,000,000). 28 (4) With respect to obligations incurred by a certified reinsurer under this 29 subdivision, if the security is insufficient, the commissioner shall reduce the 30 allowable credit by an amount proportionate to the deficiency, and have the 31 discretion to impose further reductions in allowable credit upon finding that there is 32 a material risk that the certified reinsurer's obligations will not be paid in full when 33 due. 34 (5) For purposes of this subdivision, a certified reinsurer whose certification has 35 been terminated for any reason shall be treated as a certified reinsurer required to 36 secure 100 percent of its obligations. 37 (A) As used in this subdivision, the term \"terminated\" means revocation, 38 suspension, voluntary surrender, and inactive status. 39 (B) If the commissioner continues to assign a higher rating as permitted by other 40 provisions of this section, this requirement shall not apply to a certified reinsurer in 41 inactive status or to a reinsurer whose certification has been suspended. 42 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 423 - (6) The commissioner shall require the certified reinsurer to post 100-percent 1 security in accordance with Section 922.5, for the benefit of the ceding insurer or 2 its estate, upon the entry of an order of rehabilitation, liquidation, or conservation 3 against the ceding insurer. 4 (7) Affiliated reinsurance transactions shall receive the same opportunity for 5 reduced security requirements as all other reinsurance transactions. 6 (8) In order to facilitate the prompt payment of claims, a certified reinsurer shall 7 not be required to post security for catastrophe recoverables for a period of one year 8 from the date of the first instance of a liability reserve entry by the ceding company 9 as a result of a loss from a catastrophic occurrence that is likely to result in 10 significant insured losses, as recognized by the commissioner. The one-year deferral 11 period is contingent upon the certified reinsurer continuing to pay claims in a timely 12 manner, as determined by the commissioner, in writing. Reinsurance recoverables 13 for only the following lines of business as reported on the NAIC annual financial 14 statement related specifically to the catastrophic occurrence shall be included in the 15 deferral: 16 (A) Line 1: Fire. 17 (B) Line 2: Allied lines. 18 (C) Line 3: Farmowners' multiple peril. 19 (D) Line 4: Homeowners' multiple peril. 20 (E) Line 5: Commercial multiple peril. 21 (F) Line 9: Inland marine. 22 (G) Line 12: Earthquake. 23 (H) Line 21: Auto physical damage. 24 (9) Credit for reinsurance under this section shall apply only to reinsurance 25 contracts entered into or renewed on or after the effective date of the certification of 26 the assuming insurer. A reinsurance contract entered into before the effective date 27 of the certification of the assuming insurer that is subsequently amended by mutual 28 agreement of the parties to the reinsurance contract after the effective date of the 29 certification of the assuming insurer, or a new reinsurance contract, covering a risk 30 for which collateral was provided previously, shall only be subject to this section 31 with respect to losses incurred and reserves reported from and after the effective 32 date of the amendment or new contract. 33 (10) This section shall not be construed to prohibit the parties to a reinsurance 34 agreement from agreeing to provisions establishing security requirements that 35 exceed the minimum security requirements established for certified reinsurers under 36 this section. 37 (j) A certified reinsurer that ceases to assume new business in this state may 38 request to maintain its certification in inactive status in order to continue to qualify 39 for a reduction in security for its in-force business. An inactive certified reinsurer 40 shall continue to comply with all applicable requirements of this section, and the 41 commissioner shall assign a rating that takes into account, if relevant, the reasons 42 why the reinsurer is not assuming new business. 43 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 424 - (k) Notwithstanding this section, credit for reinsurance or deduction from liability 1 by a domestic ceding insurer for cessions to a certified reinsurer may be disallowed 2 upon a finding by the commissioner that the application of the literal provisions of 3 this section does not accomplish its intent, or either the financial condition of the 4 reinsurer or the collateral or other security provided by the reinsurer does not, in 5 substance, satisfy the credit for reinsurance requirements in Section 922.4. 6 Comment.

If an agency delays disclosure pursuant to this clause, the agency 17 shall provide, in writing, the specific basis for the agency's determination that the 18 interest in delaying disclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure. 19 This writing shall include the estimated date for disclosure of the withheld 20 information. 21 (ii) After 60 days from the use of force, the agency may continue to delay the 22 disclosure of records or information if the disclosure could reasonably be expected 23 to interfere with a criminal enforcement proceeding against an officer who used the 24 force.

The writing shall include the estimated 28 date for the disclosure of the withheld information. Information withheld by the 29 agency shall be disclosed when the specific basis for withholding is resolved, when 30 the investigation or proceeding is no longer active, or by no later than 18 months 31 after the date of the incident, whichever occurs sooner. 32 (iii) After 60 days from the use of force, the agency may continue to delay the 33 disclosure of records or information if the disclosure could reasonably be expected 34 to interfere with a criminal enforcement proceeding against someone other than the 35 officer who used the force.

In that case, the 1 agency must show by clear and convincing evidence that the interest in preventing 2 prejudice to the active and ongoing criminal investigation or proceeding outweighs 3 the public interest in prompt disclosure of records about use of serious force by 4 peace officers and custodial officers. The agency shall release all information 5 subject to disclosure that does not cause substantial prejudice, including any 6 documents that have otherwise become available. 7 (iv) In an action to compel disclosure brought pursuant to Section 6258 Sections 8 7923.000 and 7923.005 of the Government Code, an agency may justify delay by 9 filing an application to seal the basis for withholding, in accordance with Rule 2.550 10 of the California Rules of Court, or any successor rule thereto, if disclosure of the 11 written basis itself would impact a privilege or compromise a pending investigation. 12 (B) If criminal charges are filed related to the incident in which force was used, 13 the agency may delay the disclosure of records or information until a verdict on 14 those charges is returned at trial or, if a plea of guilty or no contest is entered, the 15 time to withdraw the plea pursuant to Section 1018. 16 (C) During an administrative investigation into an incident described in 17 subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1), the agency may delay the disclosure of records 18 or information until the investigating agency determines whether the use of force 19 violated a law or agency policy, but no longer than 180 days after the date of the 20 employing agency's discovery of the use of force, or allegation of use of force, by 21 a person authorized to initiate an investigation, or 30 days after the close of any 22 criminal investigation related to the peace officer or custodial officer's use of force, 23 whichever is later. 24 (8) A record of a civilian complaint, or the investigations, findings, or dispositions 25 of that complaint, shall not be released pursuant to this section if the complaint is 26 frivolous, as defined in Section 128.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, or if the 27 complaint is unfounded. 28 (c) Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) and (b), a department or agency shall release 29 to the complaining party a copy of his or her the party's own statements at the time 30 the complaint is filed. 31 (d) Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) and (b), a department or agency that 32 employs peace or custodial officers may disseminate data regarding the number, 33 type, or disposition of complaints (sustained, not sustained, exonerated, or 34 unfounded) made against its officers if that information is in a form which that does 35 not identify the individuals involved. 36 (e) Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) and (b), a department or agency that employs 37 peace or custodial officers may release factual information concerning a disciplinary 38 investigation if the officer who is the subject of the disciplinary investigation, or the 39 officer's agent or representative, publicly makes a statement he or she the officer, 40 agent, or representative knows to be false concerning the investigation or the 41 imposition of disciplinary action. Information may not be disclosed by the peace or 42 custodial officer's employer unless the false statement was published by an 43 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 517 - established medium of communication, such as television, radio, or a newspaper. 1 Disclosure of factual information by the employing agency pursuant to this 2 subdivision is limited to facts contained in the officer's personnel file concerning 3 the disciplinary investigation or imposition of disciplinary action that specifically 4 refute the false statements made public by the peace or custodial officer or his or 5 her the officer's agent or representative. 6 (f)(1) The department or agency shall provide written notification to the 7 complaining party of the disposition of the complaint within 30 days of the 8 disposition. 9 (2) The notification described in this subdivision shall not be conclusive or 10 binding or admissible as evidence in any separate or subsequent action or 11 proceeding brought before an arbitrator, court, or judge of this state or the United 12 States. 13 (g) This section does not affect the discovery or disclosure of information 14 contained in a peace or custodial officer's personnel file pursuant to Section 1043 15 of the Evidence Code. 16 (h) This section does not supersede or affect the criminal discovery process 17 outlined in Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 1054) of Title 6 of Part 2, or the 18 admissibility of personnel records pursuant to subdivision (a), which codifies the 19 court decision in Pitchess v.

If the director 5 determines that the revenue collected during the preceding fiscal year was greater 6 or less than the cost to operate the program, the board shall adjust the fees to 7 compensate for the overcollection or undercollection of revenues. 8 (4)(A) The reporting fees established pursuant to this subdivision shall be 9 deposited in the Mine Reclamation Account, which is hereby created. Any fees, 10 penalties, interest, fines, or charges collected by the supervisor or board pursuant to 11 this chapter or Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 2710) shall be deposited in the 12 Mine Reclamation Account. The money in the account shall be available to the 13 department and board, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for the purpose of 14 carrying out this section and complying with Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 15 2710), which includes, but is not limited to, the classification and designation of 16 areas with mineral resources of statewide or regional significance, reclamation plan 17 and financial assurance review, mine inspection, and enforcement. 18 (B)(i) In addition to reporting fees, the board shall collect five dollars ($5) per 19 ounce of gold and ten cents ($0.10) per ounce of silver mined within the state and 20 shall deposit the fees collected in the Abandoned Mine Reclamation and Minerals 21 Fund Subaccount, which is hereby created in the Mine Reclamation Account. The 22 department may expend the moneys in the subaccount, upon appropriation by the 23 Legislature, for only the purposes of Section 2796.5 and as authorized herein for the 24 remediation of abandoned mines. 25 (ii) Notwithstanding subdivision (j) of Section 2796.5, fees collected pursuant to 26 clause (i) may also be used to remediate features of historic abandoned mines and 27 lands that they impact. For the purposes of this section, historic abandoned mines 28 are mines for which operations have been conducted before January 1, 1976, and 29 include, but are not limited to, historic gold and silver mines. 30 (5) In case of late payment of the reporting fee, a penalty of not less than one 31 hundred dollars ($100) or 10 percent of the amount due, whichever is greater, plus 32 interest at the rate of 11/2 percent per month, computed from the delinquent date of 33 the assessment until and including the date of payment, shall be assessed. New 34 mining operations that have not submitted a report shall submit a report prior to 35 commencement of operations. The new operation shall submit its fee according to 36 the reasonable fee schedule adopted by the board, and the month that the report is 37 received shall become that operation's anniversary month. 38 (e) The lead agency, or the board when acting as the lead agency, may impose a 39 fee upon each mining operation to cover the reasonable costs incurred in 40 implementing this chapter and Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 2710). 41 (f) For purposes of this section, \"mining operation\" means a mining operation of 42 any kind or character whatever in this state, including, but not limited to, a mining 43 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 572 - operation that is classified as a \"surface mining operation\" as defined in Section 1 2735, unless excepted by Section 2714. For the purposes of fee collections only, 2 \"mining operation\" may include one or more mines operated by a single operator or 3 mining company on one or more sites, if the total annual combined mineral 4 production for all sites is less than 100 troy ounces for precious metals, if precious 5 metals are the primary mineral commodity produced, or less than 100,000 short tons 6 if the primary mineral commodity produced is not precious metals. 7 (g) Any information in reports submitted pursuant to subdivision (a) that includes 8 or otherwise indicates the total mineral production, reserves, or rate of depletion of 9 any mining operation may not be disclosed to any member of the public, as defined 10 in subdivision (b) of Section 6252 Section 7920.515 of the Government Code. Other 11 portions of the reports are public records unless excepted by statute. Statistical 12 bulletins based on these reports and published under Section 2205 shall be compiled 13 to show, for the state as a whole and separately for each lead agency, the total of 14 each mineral produced therein. In order not to disclose the production, reserves, or 15 rate of depletion from any identifiable mining operation, no production figure shall 16 be published or otherwise disclosed unless that figure is the aggregated production 17 of not less than three mining operations. If the production figure for any lead agency 18 would disclose the production, reserves, or rate of depletion of less than three 19 mining operations or otherwise permit the reasonable inference of the production, 20 reserves, or rate of depletion of any identifiable mining operation, that figure shall 21 be combined with the same figure of not less than two other lead agencies without 22 regard to the location of the lead agencies. The bulletin shall be published annually 23 by June 30 or as soon thereafter as practicable. 24 (h) The approval of a form by the board pursuant to this section is not the adoption 25 of a regulation for purposes of the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 26 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the 27 Government Code) and is not subject to that act. 28 Comment.

Section 827.9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read: 25 827.9. (a) It is the intent of the Legislature to reaffirm its belief that records or 26 information gathered by law enforcement agencies relating to the taking of a minor 27 into custody, temporary custody, or detention (juvenile police records) should be 28 confidential. Confidentiality is necessary to protect those persons from being denied 29 various opportunities, to further the rehabilitative efforts of the juvenile justice 30 system, and to prevent the lifelong stigma that results from having a juvenile police 31 record. Although these records generally should remain confidential, the Legislature 32 recognizes that certain circumstances require the release of juvenile police records 33 to specified persons and entities. The purpose of this section is to clarify the persons 34 and entities entitled to receive a complete copy of a juvenile police record, to specify 35 the persons or entities entitled to receive copies of juvenile police records with 36 certain identifying information about other minors removed from the record, and to 37 provide procedures for others to request a copy of a juvenile police record.

The juvenile court may issue orders prohibiting or 26 limiting the release of information contained in the juvenile police record.

Section 14105.8 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to 16 read: 17 14105.8. (a) The department may enter into contracts with manufacturers of 18 enteral nutrition products that can be used as a therapeutic regimen to prevent 19 serious disability or death in patients with medically diagnosed conditions that 20 preclude the full use of regular food, on a bid or nonbid basis. The department shall 21 maintain a list of those products for which contracts have been executed. For those 22 contracts that generate rebates, those rebates shall be managed through the 23 department's drug rebate accounting system. 24 (b)(1) To ensure that the health needs of Medi-Cal beneficiaries are met, the 25 department shall, when evaluating a decision to execute a contract, and when 26 evaluating enteral nutrition products for retention on, addition to, or deletion from, 27 the list of enteral nutrition products, consider all of the following criteria: 28 (A) The safety of the product. 29 (B) The effectiveness of the product. 30 (C) The essential need for the product. 31 (D) The potential for misuse of the product. 32 (E) The immediate or long-term cost effectiveness of the product. 33 (2) The deficiency of a product when measured by one of the criteria specified in 34 paragraph (1) may be sufficient to support a decision that the product should be 35 deleted from, should not be added to, or should not be retained on, the list of medical 36 supplies. However, the superiority of a product under one criterion may be sufficient 37 to warrant the addition or retention of the product, notwithstanding a deficiency in 38 another criterion. 39 (c) In order that Medi-Cal beneficiaries may have access to a comprehensive 40 range of enteral nutrition products pursuant to subdivision (a), the department shall 41 ensure that there is representation on the list of both general use and specialized use 42 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 684 - enteral nutrition products. The department deems all products designed to meet the 1 normal needs of infants, and all products that are an incomplete source of nutrition, 2 including modular products, and all products intended for use in weight loss, are not 3 benefits of the Medi-Cal program. The department may deem an incomplete product 4 a benefit for patients with diagnoses, including, but not limited to, malabsorption 5 and inborn errors of metabolism, when the product either appropriately lacks only 6 an offending nutrient, or has been shown to not be investigational nor experimental 7 when used as part of a therapeutic regimen to prevent serious disability or death, or 8 when both conditions apply. 9 (d) In order to achieve maximum cost savings, the Legislature declares that an 10 expedited process for contracts under this section is necessary. Therefore, contracts 11 entered into on a nonbid basis shall be exempt from Chapter 2 (commencing with 12 Section 10290) of Part 2 of Division 2 of the Public Contract Code. 13 (e) Deletions made to the list of enteral nutrition products shall become effective 14 no sooner than 30 days after publication of the changes in provider bulletins. 15 (f) Changes made to the list of enteral nutrition products under this or any other 16 section are exempt from the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act 17 (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340), Chapter 4 (commencing with 18 Section 11370), and Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of 19 Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code), and shall not be subject to the review 20 and approval of the Office of Administrative Law. 21 (g) The department may provide beneficiaries continuing care for products 22 deleted from the list of enteral nutrition products. The department shall assess the 23 need for continuing care based on the criteria in subdivision (b) and the potential 24 impact on beneficiary access to appropriate therapy. To be eligible for continuing 25 care status under this subdivision, a beneficiary must be taking the enteral nutrition 26 product when the product is deleted. Additionally, the department shall have 27 received a claim for the enteral nutrition product with a date of service that is within 28 100 days prior to the date the product was deleted. A beneficiary shall remain 29 eligible for continuing care status provided that a claim is submitted for the enteral 30 nutrition product in question at least every 100 days and the date of service of the 31 claim is within 100 days of the date of service of the last claim submitted for the 32 same enteral nutrition product. 33 (h) The department shall provide individual notice to Medi-Cal beneficiaries at 34 least 60 calendar days prior to the effective date of the deletion of any enteral 35 nutrition product from the list of enteral nutrition products. The notice shall include 36 a description of the beneficiary's right to a fair hearing and shall encourage the 37 beneficiary to consult a physician to determine if an appropriate substitute enteral 38 nutrition product is available from Medi-Cal. 39 (i) Enteral nutrition products authorized pursuant to subdivision (a) shall be 40 available only through prior authorization.

Section 14129.2 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to 37 read: 38 14129.2. (a)(1) Commencing with the state fiscal quarter beginning on July 1, 39 2018, and continuing each state fiscal quarter thereafter for which this article is 40 implemented, there shall be imposed a quality assurance fee for each emergency 41 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 705 - medical transport provided by each emergency medical transport provider subject 1 to the fee in accordance with this section. 2 (2) The director shall ensure that the quality assurance fee per emergency medical 3 transport imposed pursuant to this article is collected. 4 (b)(1) On or before June 15, 2018, and continuing each June 15 thereafter for 5 which this article is implemented, the director shall calculate the annual quality 6 assurance fee rate applicable to the following state fiscal year based on the most 7 recently collected data from emergency medical transport providers pursuant to 8 Section 14129.1. The director may correct any identified material or significant 9 errors in the data collected from emergency medical transport providers pursuant to 10 Section 14129.1 for the purposes of calculating the annual quality assurance fee rate. 11 The director's determination whether to exercise his or her the director's discretion 12 to correct any data pursuant to this paragraph shall not be subject to judicial review, 13 except that an emergency medical transport provider may bring a writ of mandate 14 under Section 1085 of the Code of Civil Procedure to rectify an abuse of discretion 15 by the director in correcting that emergency medical transport provider's data when 16 that correction results in a greater fee amount for that provider pursuant to this 17 section. 18 (A) For the state fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2018, the annual quality 19 assurance fee rate shall be calculated by multiplying the projected total annual gross 20 receipts for all emergency medical transport providers subject to the fee by 5.1 21 percent, which resulting product shall be divided by the projected total annual 22 emergency medical transports by all emergency medical transport providers subject 23 to the fee for the state fiscal year. 24 (B) For state fiscal years beginning July 1, 2019, and continuing each state fiscal 25 year thereafter, the annual quality assurance fee rate shall be calculated by a ratio, 26 the numerator of which shall be the sum of: (i) the product of the projected aggregate 27 fee schedule amount and the effective state medical assistance percentage and (ii) 28 the amount described in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (f) for the 29 state fiscal year, and the denominator of which shall be 90 percent of the projected 30 total annual emergency medical transports by all emergency medical transport 31 providers subject to the fee for the state fiscal year. 32 (2) On or before June 15, 2018, and continuing each June 15 thereafter for which 33 this article is implemented, the director shall publish the annual quality assurance 34 fee rate on its Internet Web site internet website. 35 (3) In no case shall the fees calculated pursuant to this subdivision and collected 36 pursuant to this article exceed the amounts allowable under federal law. If, on or 37 before June 15 of each year, the director makes a determination that the fees 38 collected pursuant to this subdivision exceed the amounts allowable under federal 39 law, the director may reduce the add-on increase to the fee-for-service payment 40 schedule described in Section 14129.3 only to the extent necessary to reflect the 41 amount of fees allowable under federal law in an applicable state fiscal year. 42 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 706 - (4) If, during a state fiscal year for which this article is operative, the actual or 1 projected available fee amount exceeds or is less than the actual or projected 2 aggregate fee schedule amount by more than 1 percent, the director shall adjust the 3 annual quality assurance fee rate so that the available fee amount for the state fiscal 4 year will approximately equal the aggregate fee schedule amount for the state fiscal 5 year. The available fee amount for a state fiscal year shall be considered to equal 6 the aggregate fee schedule amount for the state fiscal year if the difference between 7 the available fee amount for the state fiscal year and the aggregate fee schedule 8 amount for the state fiscal year constitutes less than 1 percent of the aggregate fee 9 schedule amount for the state fiscal year. 10 (c)(1) Each emergency medical transport provider subject to the fee shall remit to 11 the department an amount equal to the annual quality assurance fee rate for the 12 2018-19 state fiscal year multiplied by the number of transports reported or that 13 should have been reported by the emergency medical transport provider pursuant to 14 subdivision (b) of Section 14129.1 in the quarter beginning on April 1, 2018, based 15 on a schedule established by the director. The schedule established by the director 16 for the fee payment described in this paragraph shall require remittance of the fee 17 payment according to the following guidelines: 18 (A) The director shall require an emergency medical transport provider that 19 rendered 35,000 or more Medi-Cal fee-for-service emergency medical transports 20 during the 2016-17 state fiscal year to remit the fee payment described in this 21 paragraph on or after July 1, 2018. 22 (B) The director shall require an emergency medical transport provider that 23 rendered fewer than 35,000 Medi-Cal fee-for-service emergency medical transports 24 during the 2016-17 state fiscal year to remit 50 percent or less of the fee payment 25 described in this paragraph on or after August 1, 2018. 26 (C) The director shall require an emergency medical transport provider that 27 rendered fewer than 35,000 Medi-Cal fee-for-service emergency medical transports 28 during the 2016-17 state fiscal year to remit any remaining fee payment amount 29 described in this paragraph on or after August 15, 2018. 30 (2) Commencing with the state fiscal quarter beginning on October 1, 2018, and 31 continuing each state fiscal quarter thereafter, on or before the first day of each state 32 fiscal quarter, each emergency medical transport provider subject to the fee shall 33 remit to the department an amount equal to the annual quality assurance fee rate for 34 the applicable state fiscal year multiplied by the number of transports reported or 35 that should have been reported by the emergency medical transport provider 36 pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 14129.1 in the immediately preceding quarter. 37 (d)(1) Interest shall be assessed on quality assurance fees not paid on the date due 38 at the greater of 10 percent per annum or the rate at which the department assesses 39 interest on Medi-Cal program overpayments pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 40 14171. Interest shall begin to accrue the day after the date the payment was due and 41 shall be deposited in the Medi-Cal Emergency Medical Transport Fund established 42 in subdivision (f). 43 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 707 - (2) In the event that any fee payment is more than 60 days overdue, the department 1 may deduct the unpaid fee and interest owed from any Medi-Cal reimbursement 2 payments owed to the emergency medical transport provider until the full amount 3 of the fee, interest, and any penalties assessed under this article are recovered. Any 4 deduction made pursuant to this subdivision shall be made only after the department 5 gives the emergency medical transport provider written notification. Any deduction 6 made pursuant to this subdivision may be deducted over a period of time that takes 7 into account the financial condition of the emergency medical transport provider. 8 (3) In the event that any fee payment is more than 60 days overdue, a penalty 9 equal to the interest charge described in paragraph (1) shall be assessed and due for 10 each month for which the payment is not received after 60 days. Any funds resulting 11 from a penalty imposed pursuant to this paragraph shall be deposited into the Medi-12 Cal Emergency Medical Transport Fund created pursuant to subdivision (f). 13 (4) The director may waive a portion or all of either the interest or penalties, or 14 both, assessed under this article in the event the director determines, in his or her 15 the director's sole discretion, that the emergency medical transport provider has 16 demonstrated that imposition of the full amount of the quality assurance fee 17 pursuant to the timelines applicable under this article has a high likelihood of 18 creating an undue financial hardship for the provider. Waiver of some or all of the 19 interest or penalties pursuant to this paragraph shall be conditioned on the 20 emergency medical transport provider's agreement to make fee payments on an 21 alternative schedule developed by the department. 22 (e) The department shall accept an emergency medical transport provider's 23 payment even if the payment is submitted in a rate year subsequent to the rate year 24 in which the fee was assessed. 25 (f)(1) The director shall deposit the quality assurance fees collected pursuant to 26 this section in the Medi-Cal Emergency Medical Transport Fund, which is hereby 27 created in the State Treasury and, notwithstanding Section 13340 of the Government 28 Code, is continuously appropriated without regard to fiscal years to the department 29 for the purposes specified in this article. Notwithstanding Section 16305.7 of the 30 Government Code, the fund shall also include interest and dividends earned on 31 moneys in the fund. 32 (2) The moneys in the Medi-Cal Emergency Medical Transport Fund, including 33 any interest and dividends earned on money in the fund, shall be available 34 exclusively to enhance federal financial participation for ambulance services under 35 the Medi-Cal program and to provide additional reimbursement to, and to support 36 quality improvement efforts of, emergency medical transport providers, and to pay 37 for the state's administrative costs and to provide funding for health care coverage 38 for Californians, in the following order of priority: 39 (A) To pay for the department's staffing and administrative costs directly 40 attributable to implementing this article, not to exceed the following amounts: 41 (i) For the 2018-19 state fiscal year, one million three thousand dollars 42 ($1,003,000), exclusive of any federal matching funds. 43 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 708 - (ii) For the 2019-20 state fiscal year and each state fiscal year thereafter, three 1 hundred seventy-four thousand dollars ($374,000), exclusive of any federal 2 matching funds. 3 (B) To pay for the health care coverage in each applicable state fiscal year in the 4 amount of 10 percent of the annual quality assurance fee collection amount, 5 exclusive of any federal matching funds. 6 (C) To make increased payments to emergency medical transport providers 7 pursuant to this article. 8 (g) In the event of a merger, acquisition, or similar transaction involving an 9 emergency medical transport provider that has outstanding quality assurance fee 10 payment obligations pursuant to this article, including any interest and penalty 11 amounts owed, the resultant or successor emergency medical transport provider 12 shall be responsible for paying to the department the full amount of outstanding 13 quality assurance fee payments, including any applicable interest and penalties, 14 attributable to the emergency medical transport provider for which it was assessed, 15 upon the effective date of such the transaction. An entity considering a merger, 16 acquisition, or similar transaction involving an emergency medical transport 17 provider may submit a request pursuant to Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 18 6250) Division 10 (commencing with Section 7920.000) of Title 1 of the 19 Government Code to ascertain the outstanding quality assurance fee payment 20 obligations of the emergency medical transport provider pursuant to this article as 21 of the date of the department's response to that request. 22 Comment.

The 23 governing board shall consider the matter within 60 days after receiving the notice 24 and shall promptly thereafter provide written notice of the governing board's 25 decision.

This standard requires that the 8 governing board identify any state or federal statute or regulation that is overlapped 9 or duplicated by the proposed regulation and justify any overlap or duplication. This 10 standard is not intended to prohibit the governing board from printing relevant 11 portions of enabling legislation in regulations when the duplication is necessary to 12 satisfy the clarity standard in subparagraph (C). This standard is intended to prevent 13 the indiscriminate incorporation of statutory language in a regulation. 14 (g) The requirements of the Ralph M. Brown Act (Chapter 9 (commencing with 15 Section 54950) of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the Government Code) shall 16 apply to the meetings of the governing board, including meetings held pursuant to 17 subdivision (i), except the board may meet in closed session to consider and take 18 action on matters pertaining to contracts and contract negotiations with providers of 19 health care services. 20 (h)(1) The governing board shall comply with the following procedures for public 21 meetings held to eliminate or reduce the level of services, restrict eligibility for 22 services, or adopt regulations: 23 (A) Provide prior public notice of those meetings. 24 (B) Provide that notice not less than 30 days prior to those meetings. 25 (C) Publish that notice in a newspaper of general circulation in each participating 26 CMSP county. 27 (D) Include in the notice, at a minimum, the amount and type of each proposed 28 change, the expected savings, and the number of persons affected. 29 (E) Either hold those meetings in the county seats of at least four regionally 30 distributed CMSP participating counties, or, alternatively, hold two meetings in 31 Sacramento County. 32 (2) For meetings held outside Sacramento County, the requirements for public 33 meetings pursuant to this subdivision to eliminate or reduce the level of services, or 34 to restrict the eligibility for services or hear testimony regarding regulations to 35 implement any of these service charges, are satisfied if at least three voting members 36 of the governing board hold the meetings as required and report the testimony from 37 those meetings to the full governing board at its next regular meeting. No action 38 shall be taken at any meeting held outside Sacramento County pursuant to this 39 paragraph. 40 (i) Records of the County Medical Services Program and of the governing board 41 that relate to rates of payment or to the board's negotiations with providers of health 42 care services or to the governing board's deliberative processes regarding either 43 Pre-Print Recommendation March 19, 2020 - 719 - shall not be subject to disclosure pursuant to the California Public Records Act 1 (Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 Division 10 2 (commencing with Section 7920.000) of Title 1 of the Government Code). 3 (j) The following definitions shall govern the construction of this part, unless the 4 context requires otherwise: 5 (1) \"CMSP\" or \"program\" means the County Medical Services Program, which 6 is the program by which health care services are provided to eligible persons in those 7 counties electing to participate in the CMSP pursuant to Section 16809. 8 (2) \"CMSP county\" means a county that has elected to participate pursuant to 9 Section 16809 in the CMSP. 10 (3) \"Governing Board\" means the County Medical Services Program Governing 11 Board established pursuant to this section. 12 Comment.
