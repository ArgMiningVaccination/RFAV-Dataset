An organism can change itself. \u2014Robert Augros and George Stanciu In The New Biology Every medicine emerges out of the interaction between biology and culture. Medical practices are the productof a social, political, and economic milieu, shaped bycustomary habits and traditions, many having little todo with science, evidence, or even medicine itself. 1 Chinese traditional medicine has been shaped through continu-ous use by what is now one-quarter of the world's population. Formore than 23 centuries, the people of China have used it to diag-nose, treat, and prevent disease as well as to foster health. In modern Western medicine, the mechanistic, quantitative constructs of science prevail, whereas in the traditional medicineof China, organismic, 2qualitative schemata describe individuals as resilient, dynamic ecosystems. Whereas the focus of medicalscience is upon the pathologic entity, Chinese traditional medi-cine draws upon a nature-centered cosmology that emphasizesthe relationship between the seed and the soil: what is it aboutthe terrain that permits cancer, or any disease, to take root? Since the time of its origins 3,000 years ago, Chinese medi- cine ( Zhong Yi ) has been used for the treatment of tumors, iden- tified in antiquity as liu yan , meaning lumps as hard as a rock , or as zhong yang , meaning inflamed ulcers . Over the course of these millennia, various strategies have developed, ranging from: Reducing pain, swelling, inflammation, and tumor mass; Improving host resistance through the use of Fuzheng Gu Ben therapy, meaning to strengthen what is correct and secure the root, which in modern language means to preserve immune com- petence and enhance the function of the internal organs tocounter chemotherapy-induced immune or myelosuppression; Potentiating the effects of conventional radiation and chemotherapies; Preventing, controlling, and treating the adverse effects of conventional treatment, including fatigue, weakness, gastroin-testinal distress, loss of appetite, nausea, emesis, and leukopenia. In 1999, a San Francisco population-based study indicated that 72% of women with breast cancer used at least 1 form ofcomplementary or alternative medicine (CAM). 3While few abandoned conventional treatment, only half reported the use ofCAM to their physicians. 4An understanding and appreciation of Chinese medicine may lead to greater comfort on the part ofproviders ill at ease with the use of therapies about which theyhave neither training nor experience. This in turn may lead toimproved doctor-patient communication and cooperation. Because Chinese medicine appears to protect against the damaging effects of chemotherapy and radiation, it increases thelikelihood that patients will suffer less during, and recover theirhealth after completing these therapies, enhancing quality oflife. Chinese medicine treats the patient as well as the disease. There are various approaches to the subject of how Chinese medicine treats cancer, and an equivalent number of lan-guages\u2014one expresses how Chinese medicine understands thebody and thinks about what we call cancer, using its own tradi-tional vocabulary that has endured over centuries; another is sci-entific, reporting research findings on the use of acupunctureand Chinese herbal medicine, describing them in modern neuro-physiological and biochemical terms. CHINESE MEDICINE AND CANCER: ANCIENT AND MODERN CONCEPTS Derived from the word malign, meaning harmful or malevo- lent, malignant means that which may cause mortal damage. InChinese medicine, mortal damage is a consequence of the disorga-nization and separation of yin-yang (jing-shen, blood-qi )\u2014a thresh- old beyond which the organism is unable to sustain harmony andCHINESE MEDICINE AND CANCER CARE Harriet Beinfield, LAc, Efrem Korngold, LAc, OMD This excerpt from Marc S.

Cancerous masses, lumps, and tumors are the conse- quence of unmitigated accumulations of qi, moisture , and blood that have become toxic , transforming what is healthy into mor- bid tissue, simultaneously obstructing and usurping normal cir-culation. Prolonged stagnation eventually leads to depletion of qiand blood, and ultimately essence . Because essence governs growth and maturation, loss of or damage to it can result in adisregulation of growth typical of cancer, a process of uncon-trolled proliferation of immature, undifferentiated, malformedcells. Therefore, treatment that supplements qi, moisture , and blood ; restores circulation and eliminates stasis; removes toxins ; replenishes essence ; and dissolves masses is critical in the treat- ment of cancer. As early as the 11th century BCE, descriptions of tumors were inscribed on oracle bones and turtle shells. Certain doctorsspecialized in the treatment of these lesions, referred to as liu, meaning tumor, derived from a word meaning stuck . Around 200 BCE, during the Han Dynasty, tumors became known as hard lumps or ulcerated lesions. Both benign and malignant masseswere further differentiated anatomically as ulcers or abscessesthat arise between the muscle and bone ( yen, ai, chu ); carbuncles (yung ) that appear on the surface of muscles and skin; and hard obstructions ( cheng chia ) that arise in the internal organs. In the 12th century, the term ai, another expression for inflamed ulcers, became synonymous with that for cancer. Comparable toidentifying contemporary early warning signs , traditional doctors noted the severity of swellings, lumps, and masses, their depth(skin, muscle, bone, viscera), density and firmness, mobility,color, heat, presence of fluid or pus, and the severity, quality andvariability of pain and other sensations such as itching and burn-ing in formulating the diagnosis of malignancy. 5 Classical and modern writings regard the etiology of most serious disorders, including benign and malignant tumors, asstemming from internal injuries, emotional trauma, invasion ofpathogenic factors such as heat, cold, dampness, dryness , or the accumulation of toxins , often due to improper digestion and poor elimination of metabolic wastes. Jia Kun, a Chinese traditionalmedicine oncologist writing in 1980, says that whatever upsetsnormal body function can lead to tumor formation, causing can-cer. Tumors are the end result of a prolonged process of accumu-lation and densification of tissue due to the persistent stagnationof qiand blood , which, if unrelieved, becomes toxic , critically dam- aging the healthy function of the organ systems. 6 C.S. Cheung explains the relationship between generating blood and circulating it, preventing both deficiency and stagnation: \"The essence of fluid and grain [nourishment from food anddrink] infuses into the meridians and forms ying qi . It then circu- lates to the heart and enters the blood . The blood flows to every part of the body and moistens and lubricates all the tissues. Whenthere is insufficiency of ying qi , the distribution of qiis endangered. Thus, the blood does not flow smoothly, encouraging the forma- tion of blood stasis and ecchymosis [ blood that congeals outside the vessels]. New blood is unable to be generated when obstructed by stasis and ecchymosis. Consequently, therapeutic measures aretaken to remove the obstruction and generate new blood .\" Cheung recommends that herbs such as angelica, salvia, and millettia beused, explaining that the herb millettia treats both deficiency andstasis because it both engenders and circulates blood . 7 As discussed, the circulation of qiand blood can be imped- ed by physical or psychological disturbances. Just as thermalcold constricts blood vessels, causing inhibition of movement and depressed metabolism, so can prolonged sadness. Heat dries the blood , and emotions like anxiety, anger, and anguish that produce heat can be as harmful as prolonged exposure to intense summer sun. Congestion of blood and moisture can gen- erate emotional discomfort, and unresolved suffering can causeqiand blood stasis. An osteoma could be the outcome of accu- mulated heat (regardless of its source) in the kidney (the kidney governs bone and marrow) that dries and erodes the moist,spongy substances in bone, causing the formation of a hardand immobile mass. Additional factors like the effects of envi-ronmental pollution, chemical contamination of food, fungi,viruses, and bacteria can also produce stagnation of qiand blood . The traditional view does not give greater emphasis to either the poisonous effects of entrenched negative emotions orspoiled food: toxins , regardless of their origin, are identified by their pernicious effects. Tumors in the breast may result fromtoxic accumulation and stagnation of qiand blood in the chan- nels that pass through the breast, eventually producing a lump. The following sequence outlines a likely etiology of malig- nancy: adverse pathogenic factors initiate the stagnation anddepletion of qi, moisture , and blood ; the persistence of deficiency and stasis impairs the coordinated function of the organ net-works, which leads to further weakness, obstruction, and attritionof essence , the original source ( yuan ) of qiand blood . The malig- nant process is characterized by extreme disorder. When qi, blood , and essence become depleted enough, yin-yang begins to dis- integrate or separate, and chaos ensues. Disorganization of cellu-lar behavior is a manifestation of the loss of coherence\u2014failure ofthe body to govern differentiation and proliferation. The development of cancer is a progression from extreme stagnation to emptiness, to dissociation, to alien-ation, and finally, anarchy and death. Critical stasis meansthat a region of tissue is no longer governable by the ordinarycirculatory and regulatory mechanisms of qi, leading eventu- ally to a degeneration of coordinated activity. Critical empti-ness means that the region sequestered by the malignantprocess consumes the physiological resources of the organ-ism, but contributes nothing in return, engendering an accel-erating process of attrition. And critical alienation ismanifested in the attitude of hopelessness and helplessnessthat a person experiences when a non-responsive and insen-sate entity\u2014the cancer\u2014arising from the organism's ownsacred terrain, expropriates its vital resources while ceasingto be subject to its ontological influence. Cancer is a condi-tion of functional chaos, representing one of the mostadvanced stages of disorganization\u2014 wild qi \u2014requiring intensive and aggressive strategies to restore integrity. Thiscondition known as wild qi prefigures the fatal separation of yin-yang .8,9(See Figures 1 and 2.) CANCER TYPES: DIAGNOSTIC PATTERNS Cancer patterns typically involve phlegm, toxins, deficient qi and blood , and blood stagnation. The same cancer, eg, stomach cancer may result from a variety of patterns, such as liver qiinvading the stomach, stomach yang deficiency, phlegm stagnation and food retention, blood stagnation due to qi stagnation, stom- ach yin deficiency due to stomach heat , or qiand blood deficiency. For colon cancer, the patterns may be damp heat in the largeintestine, toxins, spleen and kidney yang deficiency, liver and kid- ney yin deficiency, and qiand blood deficiency. Breast cancer pat- terns include liver qi stagnation, blood stagnation and accumulation of toxins, qiand blood deficiency, and spleen qi deficiency with phlegm accumulation. Brain tumors may resultfrom phlegm accumulation, and kidney qi or yin deficiency. 10 There are 2 diagnostic categories that interact: one is calledbian zheng , meaning the constitutional pattern of the person, and the other is bian bing , meaning the pattern of the disease. Depending on these patterns, acupuncture treatment and herbaltherapy are tailored to fit\u2014individualized according to the patho-logical pattern and the nature of the patient. Acupuncture relievesstagnation and deficiency by mobilizing the qiof particular organ networks. Herbal formulas relieve stagnation by using qiand blood activating herbs, clear heat via cooling herbs, dispel damp- ness with dry ingherbs, and antidote toxins or dissolve phlegm with herbs that remove or dissolve these pathogenic entities. Cold is relieved through the use of warming herbs, and overall strengthis restored with tonic herbs. Some patterns may serve as markersfor enhanced survival as well. For example, in a study of 254women with cervical cancer treated with radiotherapy and fol-lowed for 3 years, those diagnosed with qistagnation exhibited a significantly reduced survival compared to those diagnosed withliver and kidney yin deficiency. 11 There are many treatment protocols that combine acupunc- 40 ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Sept/oct 2003, VOL. 9, NO. 5 Chinese Medicine and Cancer Care FIGURE 1 Pathogenesis of Cancer by Stephen Cowan, MDBlood QiToxin Dis-Integration of Organ Networks Critical Alienation Pollution Poor Elimination StagnationErosionEssence Chaotic Proliferation Concretion Terminal Chaos Deathture and medicinal herbs to reduce swelling and eliminate the pain caused by tumors as well as the adverse effects of surgery,radiation, and chemotherapy. In particular, herbal prescriptionsthat invigorate the qi, nourish the blood , clear heat and toxins , and eliminate blood stasis can strengthen the body, enhance adaptation to stress, increase host resistance to infection, inflam-mation, and proliferation of tissue, and retard the progression oftumors, promoting long-term survival. These are primary thera-peutic strategies for shrinking tumors that have been applied sincethe 17th century. 12While surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy are welcomed as viable treatments for cancer in modern China,Japan and other Asian countries, acupuncture and Chinese herbalmedicine represent complementary or adjunctive therapies thatsometimes improve the capacity of conventional Western medi-cine to achieve desired outcomes. 13 CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIATION: A YIN- YANG PERSPECTIVE14 Radiation is a form of extreme yang that produces heat and inflammation, cooking the yin, damaging the blood and moisture . The drying of blood and moisture leads to coagulation (static blood ) and congelation ( phlegm ). Stagnant blood and phlegm fur- ther impair the circulation of qi, moisture , and blood , resulting in more deficiency and weakening of the organ networks.Radiation often penetrates deep into the bones, drying the mar-row and eroding essence . Chemotherapy is a form of extreme yin, a poison thatdamages the yang , the ability of qito move the blood and mois- ture, warm the body, and transform food into qiand blood . When the qifails to move blood and fluids, blood stagnation and dampness arise. When circulation is retarded, it becomes difficult for the body to stay warm. Internal cold can transform dampness into phlegm and cause blood to coagulate. When digestion is impaired, the stomach and spleen fail to generate adequate qiand blood , and deficiency ensues. When qiis depleted, blood and fluids easily leak from the blood vesselsand body membranes. Prolonged deficiency leads to the attri-tion of marrow and essence . The adverse effects of radiation and chemotherapy parallel the signs and symptoms of severe deficiencies of qi,moisture , blood , and essence : weakness, fatigue, pallor, susceptibility to infection, edema, dehydration, hair loss, restlessness, irritability,depression, hot flashes, night sweats, thirst, dry skin, infertility,lack of libido, amenorrhea, indigestion, anorexia, weight loss,diarrhea, andmuscle pain, anemia, leukopenia, shortness of breath, conges-tive heart failure, inability to concentrate, memory loss, heart-burn and headache. Just when there is a demand for adequate qiand blood , the capacity to generate these resources is undermined. The condi-tions that produce cancer, namely stagnation, deficiency, anddisharmony, are further aggravated by radiation and chemother-apy, neither of which discriminates between healthy and abnor-mal tissue. The vicious cycle of attrition caused by the disease is Chinese Medicine and Cancer Care ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Sept/oct 2003, VOL. 9, NO. 5 41 FIGURE 2 Treatment of Cancer by Stephen Cowan, MDBlood Qi Toxin Dis-Integration of Organ NetworksHeatAccumulations Replenish Essence FunctionStagnationErosionEssence Chaotic Proliferation Concretion Dissolve MassEliminate ToxinsDispel StagnationActivate Circulation Alleviate Pain Enrich Qi Blood Moistureparalleled by the treatment. While Western medicine aggressive- ly attacks the cancer, Chinese traditional medicine supports andrestores the healthy function that enables patients to tolerateand recover from conventional therapies, surviving with animproved quality of life. ACUPUNCTURE The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference in 1997 declared that there is clear evidence thatacupuncture is an effective modality, particularly for nausea andvomiting induced by chemotherapy, and for the relief of pain.The American Cancer Society informs consumers that,\"Acupuncture is simple, and often works. It has few side effectsor complications, and the cost is low. For these reasons, it can bea good choice for some problems.\" Acupuncture is based on the assumption that qicourses through a network of channels ( jing luo ), just as streams and rivers flow under and across the surface of the earth. This latticeof channels forms a web of qi that unites all parts of the organ- ism. Within the Chinese traditional model, acupuncture worksby regulating the movement of qi. By restoring healthy circula- tion of qiand blood , stagnation resolves. By optimizing the func- tion of the 5 organ networks, vulnerability to disease is reduced.In modern language, acupuncture modulates fundamentalhomeodynamic mechanisms that govern hematopoeisis, cellularand humoral immunity, temperature pressure, respiration,metabolism, hormonal secretion sensitivity, neuromuscularcoordination, and diurnal rhythms. Microcirculation in the cap-illary beds that surround internal organs is encouraged, therebysupporting processes of healthy nutrition and detoxification.Acupuncture also stimulates the central nervous system, activat-ing mechanisms of repair and regeneration. In traditional lan-guage, acupuncture harmonizes yin-yang and the organ networks responsible for regulating growth, proliferation, anddynamic harmony. Pain signals the stagnation of qi, blood and phlegm within the channels. Slender stainless steel needles inserted in particularpoints located along these channels near the surface of the skin(acupoints), can clear stagnation, reinvigorating the function ofthe internal organs. Within the modern scientific model, themechanism of action of acupuncture has only been partiallydescribed, mostly in the area of pain relief. Through the use offunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), descriptive studieshave documented that sensory-related acupoints have brain corti-cal correspondences that may point toward an explanation of howacupuncture has effects beyond analgesia, namely upon homeosta-tic regulatory mechanisms not yet understood by Western physiol-ogy or medicine. 15Normalizing of the physiological processes of the cardiovascular,16immunological,17and gastrointestinal18sys- tems, as well as an anti-inflammatory19modulatory effect have been also been documented in preliminary studies. Acupuncture Analgesia Since the early 1970s, neurophysiologist Bruce Pomeranzhas studied the effectiveness of acupuncture on pain, nerveregeneration, and cutaneous wound healing. In 1976 Pomeranzused naloxone, successfully blockacupuncture analgesia, suggesting a physiological mechanism ofaction. He showed that acupuncture relieved chronic pain in 55%to 85% of patients, compared to a 30% relief of pain by placebo,demonstrating that acupuncture is as effective as many potentdrugs. 20Pomeranz comments, \"It should be apparent that we know more about acupuncture analgesia than about many chemi-cal drugs in routine use. For example, we know very little aboutthe mechanisms of most anesthetic gases but still use them regu-larly.\" Acupuncture analgesia is initiated by the stimulation ofsmall afferent sensory nerve fibers embedded in musculature thatsend impulses to the spinal cord to affect the three centers: spinalcord, midbrain, and hypothalamic-pituitary. When these centersare activated, neurotransmitters release endorphins, enkephalins,monoamines, and cortisol to block pain messages. 21Increases in serum -endorphin, met-enkephalin and leu-enkephalin with acupuncture have also been documented.22 Needles placed near the pain site, either on an acupoint or at a tender spot (trigger point), activate segmental circuits to thespinal cord as well as all three centers. Local needling usuallyprovides a more intensive analgesic effect than distal needlingwhich the midbrain and pituitary without benefit tothe local segmental circuit to the spinal cord. In practice, bothlocal and distal needling enhances the overall analgesic effect.The Chinese experience with the use of acupuncture analgesia asan adjunct or alternative to chemical anesthesia during surgeryreveals that, in addition to effectively inhibiting the painresponse, acupuncture also maintains normalized blood pres-sure, visceral reflexes (prevents collapse of the mediastinum anddiaphragm and preserves gut motility), body temperature, whilemarkedly reducing the risk of hemorrhage, accelerating woundrepair, and shortening post-operative recovery time. 23 Because pain medications can cause nausea, constipation, and fatigue, as well as require escalating doses that place patientsat risk for cardiopulmonary depression, hepatic or renal toxicity,acupuncture pain relief may prove to be of significant benefit. 24,25 In a study of 286 patients experiencing metastatic bone pain, useof an electroacupuncture apparatus resulted in 74% significantpain relief in addition to a much lower need for long-term nar-cotic analgesics. 26In a randomized study of 48 gastric carcino- ma patients receiving chemotherapy, acupuncture wascompared to pharmacological pain management with narcoticsand nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Although immedi-ate (12 hour) control was better with pharmacological therapy,after 2 months, long-term pain control was similar. Only in theacupuncture group was plasma leucine-enkephalin increased at2 months, along with improvement in other side effects ofchemotherapy and overall quality of life measures. 27 Acupuncture has also been reported to relieve the pain of herpeszoster, a typical chemotherapeutic side effect, 28as well as aid in the regeneration of nerve tissue as evidenced by improved nerveconduction in patients suffering from peripheral neuropathy. 29 42 ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Sept/oct 2003, VOL. 9, NO. 5 Chinese Medicine and Cancer CareChinese Medicine and Cancer Care ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Sept/oct 2003, VOL. 9, NO. 5 43Both pain and edema were reduced in a study of 122 patients with late-onset edema due to radiation therapy.30 Acupuncture for Nausea and Vomiting There is reliable, compelling data for the effectiveness of acupuncture in relieving nausea and vomiting. The NIH ConsensusPanel on Acupuncture in 1997 concluded, \"there is clear evidencethat needle acupuncture is efficacious for adult postoperative andchemotherapy nausea and vomiting.\" 31A systematic review of ran- domized controlled trials showed consistent, positive results.32Of 29 trials in which acupuncture was used when patients were awake,and not under anesthesia, 27 supported acupuncture. More than2000 patients showed positive results in a review of the trials thatwere of the best methodological quality. A 1989 study by J.W.Dundee from Queen's University in Belfast showed acupuncture tosignificantly relieve post-operative nausea and vomiting: 78% ofpatients treated with acupuncture were free of sickness comparedto 32% of the non-treated control group. 33Dundee's initial compara- examined effect of the acupoint knownas Pericardium 6 (Pc6 is located on the medial aspect of the armabove the wrist) in 105 patients with a history of nausea and vomit-ing in a previous round of chemotherapy. This study reported a63% anti-emetic benefit from the acupuncture. 34-37From 30-40% of women with early stage breast cancer still experience nausea andvomiting within 1 week of chemotherapy administration, even withthe use of seratonin receptor antagonists. 38Subsequent well-con- trolled studies have similarly shown acupressure or acupunctureapplied to Pc6 provides a treatment benefit in 60-70% of patientscompared to a 30% benefit with sham treatment. 39 Acupuncture Effects on Myelosuppression and HormonalMarkers In a study of 386 patients with medium and advanced-stage cancer with chemotherapy-induced leukocytopenia, acupunctureand moxibustion (heat produced by burning the herb on acupoints) increased the leukocyte count in 38% ofthe patients. 40Among 48 patients with persistent leukopenia, stimulation of the acupoint known as Stomach 36, located later-ally below the knee, led to an increased white blood cell count inmore than 90% of those treated. 41In another study of 121 patients with leukopenia during radiation and chemotherapy,after 5 daily acupuncture and moxibustion treatments, whiteblood cell counts markedly increased. 42 The immune modulatory effects of acupuncture upon patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation are summa-rized in a review article that shows an increase in peripheralblood counts of CD 3+, CD4+ and natural killer (NK) cells, as well as an elevation in the CD4+/ CD8+ ratio. Macrophage activity is also increased by both acupuncture and moxibustion.43In a study of premenopausal women that compared normal subjectsto those with benign mammary hyperplasia, measuring immuneand hormonal markers, levels of CD 8+ cells rose significantly after acupuncture, and the CD4+/ CD8+ ratio was reduced to match the control group. Serum E2and Prolactin levels declinedfollowing acupuncture, while levels of follicle-stimulating hor- mone (FSH) increased. More than 50% of the women with hyper-plasia had complete resolution of their nodules, while the othershad a significant reduction. 44Women with climacteric symptoms due to chemotherapy-induced menopause or treatment withagents like tamoxifen experience hot flashes, night sweats, dryskin and vaginal dryness, and insomnia. Studies have indicatedthat acupuncture can help to control these symptoms in over90% of the women treated. 45,46 MODERN CHINESE HERBAL RESEARCH With the renaissance of traditional Chinese medicine in the 1950s, clinical researchers in China and Japan began searchingfor ways to improve outcomes for cancer patients undergoingchemotherapy and radiation. Over the last decades, thisapproach has become known as Fuzheng Gu Ben therapy, mean- ing to strengthen what is correct and secure the root. Fuzheng herbs support non-specific resistance and are known as biologi-cal response modifiers or adaptogens. In a monograph in 1981on the use of fuzheng herbs with cancer patients, Tu Gouri com- mented, \"the treatment of malignant tumors with combinedmethods of traditional Chinese medicine and western medicinehas made much progress...patients with advanced malignanttumors usually have the symptoms of deficiency in qiand blood , deficiency of liver and kidney , and dysfunction of spleen and stom- ach. Tonics may improve the general condition and the immune function of the patients, enhance resistance against disease, andprolong their survival period. Furthermore, tonics also have pro-tective effects against immune suppression, lowering of leuko-cyte count, suppression of bone marrow, and decrease of plasmacortisol levels induced by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Allthis benefits the treatment of malignant tumors.\" 47 Researchers from the University of California at San Francisco comment that Fuzheng therapy produces possible diverse biologic effects that include: \"reduce the tumor load; pre-vent recurrence or formation of a new primary cancer; bolsterthe immune system; enhance the regulatory function of theendocrine system; protect the structure and function of internalorgans and glands; strengthen the digestive system by improvingabsorption and metabolism; protect bone marrow andhematopoeitic function; and prevent, control, and treat adverseside effects caused by conventional treatments for cancer.\" 48 Excellent sources covering the role of Chinese herbs in cancercare may be found in Cancer and Natural Medicine and Natural Compounds in Cancer Therapy by John Boik 49and the relevant monographs written by Subhuti Dharmananda, PhD, of the Institute for Traditional Medicine in Portland, Oregon.50 Treatment Strategies Clinically, Chinese herbs are usually administered not as single agents, but in multi-ingredient formulas. Formulas aredesigned to address various aspects of the disease pattern, as wellas the constitutional needs of the individual patient. For exam-ple, a given formula might use herbs that supplement qi, blood ,44 ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Sept/oct 2003, VOL. 9, NO. 5 Chinese Medicine and Cancer Careand essence combined with other ingredients to eliminate stagna- tion, toxins , and reduce tumor mass. Crude herbs decocted in teas; ingested as powders: compressed into tablets; extracted inalcohol, water, or both; and in China they may be prepared forinjection or intravenous administration. Five principles organize the formulation of many herbal prescriptions for the treatment of cancer: supplement the qiand blood to strengthen host resistance; activate circulation to dispel blood stasis and ecchymosis; relieve pain; eliminate heat and eliminate toxins ; and soften lumps and dissolve masses. 51 Herbal formulas may contain anywhere from 6-20 ingredi- ents and emphasize 1 or all of the 5 therapeutic principles. Theclinical application of these principles might best be illustratedby describing both the known pharmacological properties andactions as well as the traditional characteristics, indications, andeffects of several individual herbs and multi-ingredient formulasthat are currently being investigated and used clinically in China,Japan, and the United States. Individual Herbs The preponderance of herbs used for cancer has been an integral part of traditional practice for centuries. Althoughrecently identified as adaptogenic, immune enhancing, sinensis (dong chong Coix lachrymi-jobi ), Angelica Bupleurum chinense subprostrata (shan dou gen ), and Oldenlandia diffusa (bai hua she she cao ) have 1,800 years of clinical use. In addition to these venerable medicines, new herbs have been discovered and old ones have been put to new uses.Eleutherococcus senticosus (ci wu jia ) and Gynostemma pentaphyl- lum (jiao gu lan ) were discovered, through modern research, to contain saponin glycosides similar to those found in Panax gin- seng (ren shen ) and to exert similar adaptogenic and anti-cancer effects with the added advantage of being easier to cultivate andtherefore cheaper and easier to supply. Astragalus membranaceus (huang qi ), Eleutherococcus senticosus (ci wu jia ), and Angelica sinensis (dang gui ) were also found to contain immune modulat- ing polysaccharides similar to those occurring in Ganoderma lucidum ), and Rheum palamatum (da huang ) have demonstrated effects on microcirculation normalization of fibrin,platelet (shan dou and Oldenlandia doffisa (bai hua she she cao ), traditionally used to treat poisoning, infection, inflammation, and ulceration,have proven to have a broad range of actions including anti-tumor, anti-histamine, anti-thrombic, anti-proliferative, anti-angiogenic, cytotoxic, and immune stimulating activity. Because modern investigators are in the habit of analyzing single agents and identifying active compounds, considerableresearch has focused on celebrity herbs herb is biologically more complex than an iso- lated organic compound, and in traditional thinking confers abetter result due to the natural synergism of all the constituents.Similarly, a multi-herb formula is exponentially more complexthan a single herb, delivering even more therapeutic benefitsthan one herb alone. (See Table 1.) Herbal Formulas Many of the herbal formulas used in modern cancer thera- py and research in China are part of the traditional pharma-copoeia. Shi Quan Da Bu Tang (All Inclusive Great Tonifying Decoction), Jian Pi Tang (Decoction For Tonifying The Spleen and Stomach), Si Jun Zi Tang (Four Gentleman Decoction), Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang (Decoction For Tonifying The Middle and Augmenting The Qi), Ren Shen Yang Rong Tang (Ginseng Decoction To Nourish The Nutritive Qi), Xiao Chai Hu Tang (Minor Bupleurum Decoction) are classical (pre-19th century)prescriptions that belong to the category of tonifying and harmo-nizing formulas that generally improve health, strengthen resis-tance to stress and disease, and facilitate recovery from thedebilitating effects of chronic illness. Since the adverse effects ofmodern cancer treatments mimic the consequences of chronicillness\u2014weakness, fatigue, decreased resistance, reducedappetite, weight loss, diminished libido, cognitive decline, mus-culo-skeletal stiffness and soreness\u2014tonic prescriptions treatthese conditions and maintain healthy function. Such formulasshare many of the promising anti-cancer agents mentionedabove. Modern herbal protocols often use classical formulas as a foundation, while adding additional ingredients with anti-cancereffects. For example, the formula Fu Zheng Shengjin Tang for treating the side effects of radiotherapy is based on Si Jun Zi Tang (Four Gentleman Decoction) with the addition of ingredients tosupplement yin(blood and moisture ) and eliminate heat and toxins: Codonopsis pilolusa (dang shen ) (a substitute for PanaxChinese Medicine and Cancer Care ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Sept/oct 2003, VOL. 9, NO. 5 45Botanical name and the liver and upper GI,cures organ ptosis.

The objectives of the formula are not only to relieve the blood deficiency (anemia), mois- ture deficiency (dehydration), heat (due to radiation), and toxins (waste products and dead tissue due to tumor necrosis), but alsoto enhance the anti-cancer effects of the radiation via the anti-tumor activity of Salvia miltiorrhiza (dan shen ), cao ), and Solanum lyratum (shu yuan quan ). 52 The same formula, Si Jun Zi Tang (Four Gentleman Decoction), can be used as the core of a prescription to treat theside effects of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy damages the qiand weakens the spleen and stomach , ultimately depleting the essence and undermining the kidney . Adding Astragalus opposita (shan yao ) augment the qisupplement- ing and stomach and spleen strengthening properties of the formu- la. Three more herbs Ligustrum lucidi (nu zhen zi Rehmannia glutinosa (shu and Lycium barbarum (gou qi zi ) replenish essence and strengthen the kidney . This formula called Bu Shen Jian Pi Tang alleviates fatigue, weakness, chilliness, anorexia, anemia, leukopenia, hair loss, and increases resistance to infection. 53 In 1983, Jia Kun created a formula called Ping Xiao Dan , containing Citrus aurantium (zhi ke ), Curcuma and Agrimonia pilosa (xian he cao ). Dr Kun recommends Ping Xiao Dan as a general formula for the prevention and treat- ment of cancer, to be combined with additional formulas thatare specific for particular types of cancer. Ping Xiao Dan has mul- tiple effects: Lacca sinica cao ) eliminate stagnation of qiand blood , promote the nor- mal function of the liver and intestines, relieve pain, promotetissue regeneration, and dissolve lumps and masses. Niter (xiao shi) and Alumen (ming fan ) neutralize toxins and reduce fever and inflammation. And even though the major thrust of the for-mula appears to be anti-pathogenic, the Curcuma and Citrus aurantium (zhi ke ) also have a tonic effect on the body as a whole: \"The combination ofall these ingredients...controls and palliates solid neoplasms andmanages the corrosion. It also has the function of a tonic, anti-dote, analgesic and appetizer, revives vigor, nourishes thenerves, encourages recovery, increases the capacity of organs toresist disease, nourishes qi, and causes cancer cells to degener- ate, change shape, reduce in size, and melt.\" 54 Research Investigations A literature review performed in 1998 by the University of Texas Center for Alternative Medicine Research in Cancer sum-marized many Chinese studies, including controlled trials withhuman subjects, animal, and in vitro laboratory experiments. 55 The studies showed the impact of medicinal herbs on: disease response, survival outcome, immune response, reduction inadverse effects from chemotherapy and radiation, improvedrecovery from surgery, better quality of life, and alleviation ofpain. This review indicated that some patients who receivedChinese herbal medicine combined with conventional Westerntreatment demonstrated significantly better survival and/or dis-ease response than patients receiving Western treatment alone.But often research design has involved inadequate methodology,including the absence of randomized, placebo or blinded con-trols. While the examples that follow hardly constitute proof ofefficacy, they are suggestive of benefit, indicating that furtherresearch is desirable and necessary. For example, in a study of 76 patients with second-stage pri- mary liver cancer there were no 5-year survivors in the groupstreated with chemotherapy or radiation alone, whereas there was a10% survival in the group treated with a combination of Fu Zheng herbs and radiation, and a 16.7% survival in those treated withboth herbs and chemotherapy. 56Five-year survival rates in another study of patients with liver cancer who received chemotherapyalone were 6%, whereas when combined with the herb formula Si Jun Zi Tang Herbs that are qiand yang tonifying, that warm and strengthen the spleen and kidney , are thought to ameliorate the adverse effects of chemotherapy and radiation. Zhang Xinqicomments, \"The leukopenia caused by chemotherapy or radio-therapy is classified as a deficiency type of illness which isreferred to as the morbid condition showing deficiency of gen-uine qi, lowered body resistance, and declining of function. Then, supplementing qiand nourishing the blood , warming and invigorating the spleen and kidney are the essential therapeutic principles for remitting toxic side effects.\" 58 Two of the important toxin-removing herbs used in cancer therapy are Sophora flavescens (ku shen , meaning bitter root of miraculous effect) and Sophora subprostrata (shan dou gen ), con- taining matrine and oxymatrine series alkaloids that show activity in vitro and antitumor activity in vivo , (inhibit the growth of sarcoma-180 in laboratory mice). Oxymatrine itself is7.8 times stronger than the chemotherapeutic agent mitomycinC in its tumor inhibiting effects, without suppressing system. 59Sophora flavescens (or subprostrata ) immune respons-es. Scutellaria baicalensis (huang qin ) is another potent heat and toxin-clearing herb with anti-tumor and immune-stimulating Chinese Medicine and Cancer Care ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Sept/oct 2003, VOL. 9, NO. 5 4748 ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Sept/oct 2003, VOL. 9, NO. 5 Chinese Medicine and Cancer Careproperties in vivo and, in vitro, that inhibits platelet aggregation and induces apoptosis.60And another herb, Isatis tinctoria (ban lan gen ) contains the compound indirubin, observed by Chinese scientists to exert an effect against chronic myelocytic leukemia(CML). It inhibits DNA synthesis in neoplastic cells, particularlyimmature leukemic cells in bone marrow, while simultaneouslystimulating immune response. 61 Angelica sinensis (dang gui ) is a blood supplementing and activating herb with anti-tumor, immune stimulating, and anti-angiogenic properties that reduces vascular permeability in vitro . 62Other potent herbs in the blood activating category with direct cancer-inhibiting properties are Curcuma zedoaria (e These herbs are fibrinolytic, antithrombic, and anti-inflammato-ry. People with cancer often have elevated fibrinogen levels,increasing the stickiness of the blood so that it is more likely tocoagulate. Because the \"sticky\" factors in blood facilitate theadherence of metastatic cells to healthy tissue, and becausetumors are often encapsulated within a tough fibrin coating diffi-cult for anti-neoplastic drugs or immune cells to penetrate, herbsthat increase microcirculation, make the blood less viscous, thefibrin coating more permeable, and soften and disperse masses.When extracts of curcuma are injected in mice with tumors, thetumors shrink. 63 Enhancing Conventional Protocols To overcome the adverse effects while at the same time potentiating the desired effects of conventional treatment, a pop-ular biological response modifying formula called All InclusiveGreat Tonifying Decoction ( Shi Quan Da Bu Tang ) is often used. It appears to restore hematopoeitic function to improve periph-eral blood counts, and increases interleukin production alongwith NK cells. This formula contains Panax ginseng (ren shen ), Angelica sinensis (rou and prepared Glycyrrhiza uralensis (zhi gan cao ). It was found to potentiate the therapeutic activity of chemotherapy(Mitomycin, Cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, Fluorouracil) andradiotherapy, inhibit recurrence, prolong survival, and preventor ameliorate adverse treatment effects such as: anorexia, nau-sea, vomiting, hematotoxicity, immuno-suppression, leukopenia,thrombocytopenia, anemia, and nephropathy. In traditional terms, the herbs Panax ginseng (ren shen ), pre- pared Glycyrrhiza uralensis prepared Rehmannia glutinosa huang ) nourish the blood Astragalus membranaceus (huang invigorate qiand yang . 64In another study to determine effects of this formula on whiteblood cell counts, 134 patients with cancer who had previouslyundergone chemotherapy and radiation therapy that resulted inleukopenia were given the formula and 113 patients experienced an increase of white blood counts to normal levels. 65In a study of 58 patients with osteogenic sarcoma who were receiving eitherCisplatin and Dexamethasone (CD) or high-dose Methotrexateand Vincristine (MV), patients were randomly assigned to theherbal arm or observation. Those using the herb formula in theMV group experienced improvements in white blood cell andplatelet counts and there was less transaminase enzyme eleva-tion. Both the CD and MV groups showed improvement in post-therapy cardiac function, less nausea and vomiting, and fewerrashes than those in the control group. 66 Whereas tumor recurrence for post-surgical patients with bladder cancer was 65% with conventional treatment alone,this was reduced to 33% when patients added the use of theChinese medicinal mushroom Polyporus umbellatus (zhu ling or maitake in Japanese). 67In another study, those receiving radia- tion alone suffered from low white blood cell and plateletcounts, but this was reversed in subjects who received Chineseherbs: 40 patients recovered from 3450/c.mm to 5425/c.mm,whereas in the control group without herbs, white blood cellcounts dropped significantly. 68 Five-year survival for advanced nose and throat cancer patients receiving radiation alone was 24% whereas adding theherbal formula Yi Qi Yang Yin Tang to the conventional protocol produced a 52% five-year survival. 69In a study of 197 patients with stage III and IV nose and throat cancers, half received radia-tion in combination with the formula Yi Qi Yang Yin Tang and half received only radiotherapy. After 3 years the survival rateswere 67% and 33% respectively. This formula is targeted to nour-ish the qiand fluids as well as clear heat and toxins and eliminate blood stagnation. 70In yet another study of this formula for nasopharyngeal cancer, 272 patients were treated with radiation,half of whom received the formula. In the herb-treated group, 5-year relapse was 68% lower (12 % versus 38%), and survival rateswere also significantly improved (67% versus 48% at 5-years). 71 In 285 patients with lymph node metastases, one group received only chemotherapy with no significant tumor shrink-age; another received only herbal medicine with only 12% show-ing significant shrinkage; whereas in the group that receivedchemo, radiation, and herbs, or radiation plus herbs, 75%showed significant tumor shrinkage. 72When 70 patients with chronic gastritis and dysplasia were divided in groups accordingto traditional Chinese pattern diagnosis (hyperactive liver qi , deficiency cold of the spleen and stomach , deficiency of stomach yin, and damp heat in the spleen and stomach ) and treated accord- ingly, 84% markedly improved, 4% responded partially, and 11%were unresponsive. 73 A study at Drew University in Los Angeles investigated the effects of medicinal mushrooms on patients with advanced malig-nancies: in 2 weeks there were marked decreases in tumor associat-ed antigens and marked increases in natural killer cell activity in 8out of 11 subjects. 74In another study, patients with primary liver carcinoma who received herbs in combination with chemotherapyhad increased numbers of NK cells. 75Chinese Medicine and Cancer Care ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Sept/oct 2003, VOL. 9, NO. 5 49A study of 176 patients compared half the subjects who received injections of Astragalus membranaceus (huang qi ) and Panax ginseng (ren shen ) while undergoing chemotherapy for colon cancer, to a control group that was not administered herbal injec-tions. Those receiving the herbal injections had higher white bloodcell counts, greater macrophage activity, and increased bodyweight. 76A study of the herb astragalus at MD Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute in Houston, Texas confirmed earlier reportsby the same authors that this herb possesses immuno-potentiatingactivity, correcting in vitro T-cell function deficiency found in many cancer patients. Decades of pharmacological research haverevealed that the polysaccharides and other compounds inAstragalus membranaceus promote cellular (intensifies phagocyto- sis) and humoral (increases function of B lymphocytes) immunefunction and have in vitro anti-tumor effects on cancer cell lines. 77 Research at MD Anderson Hospital in Houston reproduced theseresults in a 1983 study, demonstrating that aqueous extracts ofAstragalus membranaceus in vitro and in vivo enhanced levels ofcirculating lymphocytes. A second study in 1988 confirmed andexpanded the previous findings that extracts of Chinese herbs pos-sess potent immune restorative activity. A polysaccharide fractionof Astragalus membranaceus (fraction 3, F-3) was isolated as mostpotent. The data indicated that extracts of astragalus could restoreT-cells from immune compromised cancer patients to normal lev-els of function. 78In a human trial, Astragalus membranaceus was found to potentiate IL-2 tenfold, permitting a smaller, less toxiceffective dose, restoring T-cell function in 9 out of 10 cancerpatients. 79Whereas the common dose of Astragalus membranaceus is 9 to 30 grams of dried herb for non-cancerous conditions, dosesas high as 60 grams per day may be administered as an immuno-stimulant. Although toxicity is low at high doses, occasionallysymptoms of over-stimulation such as insomnia, increased heartrate, palpitations, or hypertension can occur at these high doses. 80 Multiple studies on patients with stomach cancer were con- ducted using the formula Pishen Fang ( Jian Pi Yi ) that ), and Psoralea corylifolia (bu gu zhi ). One study examined 81 patients with stage III gastric can- cer who received chemotherapy. Those who also took the herbalformula experienced improved digestive and bone marrow func-tion, as well as increased survival. In the herbal group, 5-year sur-vival was 46% compared to 20% in the chemotherapy-onlygroup. 81In another study, 669 late-stage gastric cancer patients who were receiving chemotherapy were randomly divided intothe herbal arm, and the control group. Improvements in bodyweight, appetite, reduced nausea and vomiting, were observed inthe group that received the formula. White blood cell countswere 7% in the herb-treated group compared to 33% in the controlgroup. Macrophage activity was 21% greater in the treated group,and 5-year survival among 303 stage III and 63 stage IV patientswho received follow-up were 53% and 10% respectively. After 10years, 47% of the stage III patients remained alive. 82Another studyexamined 216 postoperative stomach cancer patients at stage III, and 110 patients at stage IV, showing that of the half who did notreceive the herbal formula, 75% were able to finish the completechemotherapy course, compared to 95% who received the herbs.Patients in the herb-treated group gained weight (23% vs. 8%);fewer lost weight (6% vs. 14%); fewer lost their appetite (10% vs.32%); and fewer had vomiting (4% vs. 12%). 83,84 In an animal study, Mitomycin C showed a stronger anti- tumor effect when combined with ginseng.85Similarly, when an extract of the mushroom Polyporous umbellatus (zhu ling ) was combined with Mitomycin C, the life span of tumor-bearingmice was increased by 119.9%, compared to 70% in the controlgroup treated with the drug alone. 86Ginsenosides, the active saponin compounds in the ginsengs, increase phagocytosis,appetite, blood formation, accelerate the biosynthesis of DNA,and appear to induce cancer cells to change their morphologyand become more like healthy cells. The polysaccharides inAstragalus membranaceus (huang qi ) and Panax ginseng (ren shen ) and medicinal mushrooms regulate T-cells and stimulate inter-feron and phagocytosis, producing both immune-restorative andcancer-inhibiting effects. An herbal formula used to relieve signs of cardiac distress (palpitation, irregular, small and slow pulse, occasional prema-ture ischemia) secondary to treat-ment Zhi Gan Cao Tang , or Baked Licorice Decoction, consisting of 20 gm Glycyrrhiza uralensis (gan cao ), 30 gm Rehmannia glutinosa , 30 15 gm Zingiberis officinale (jiang ), 15 gm Cannabis indica (huo ma ren ), 10 gm Panax ginseng (ren shen ), and 10 gm Cinnamomum cassia (gui zhi ) administered as a decoction. When cardiac function normalized after 6 days,Adriamycin therapy resumed, and administration of the decoc-tion was continued. 87 Another prescription developed in modern times, is a for- mula described in 1982 by Dr Hong-Yen Hsu containingWisteria and Trapa bispinosa (ling jiao ) have a history of use in China and Japan for the treatment of tumors.Coix lachryma-jobi (yi yi ren ) and Terminalia chebula (he zi ) have been used traditionally to strengthen digestive and respiratoryfunctions as well as to relieve infection and inflammation. 89 Coix lachryma-jobi is now considered a general anti-cancer agent. This prescription conforms to the principles of invigorating qi and strengthening resistance (improving digestive and respira-tory function) and clearing heat and eliminating toxins (remov- ing infection and inflammation). The US Food and Drug Administration approved the first Chinese-made anti-cancer drug for Phase II clinical human tri-als in 2001, to be conducted by the US biopharmaceutical com-pany, Oncoherb. The drug, called Kanglaite injection, is anextract distilled from the seeds of the herb Coix lachryma-jobi (yi yi ren ). It has demonstrated efficacy against lung cancer in clini- cal trials with over 200,000 cancer patients conducted in China.50 ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Sept/oct 2003, VOL. 9, NO. 5 Chinese Medicine and Cancer CareStudies have indicated that it may also be useful in the treat- ment of other types of cancer, including stomach and cervicalcancers, and solid tumors. The preliminary findings of researchconducted in the US support the Chinese trials. The new drugsignificantly improves the efficacy of radiation therapy andchemotherapy treatments in late-stage, lung cancer patients. Itis far less toxic than existing chemotherapeutic agents and iseffective in patients for whom existing treatments did not showany improvements. 90 In the November 2001 issue of Life Sciences , Henry Lai from the University of Washington reported on the cytotoxic activityof artemesinin, a compound from Artemesia annua (quing hao ). Artemesinin kills human breast cancer cells in vitro by interfer- ing with their iron metabolism. It was first discovered to be aneffective anti-malarial agent in chloroquine-resistant cases.Malarial parasites depend on high iron concentrations for repro-duction, as do cancer cells, and any micro-organisms. Excess ironis associated with increased cancer notes. Breast cancer cells haveup to 15 times more transferrin receptors than healthy cells.Acute leukemia and pancreatic cancers have also been responsiveto this agent in vitro , with no apparent adverse effects upon healthy tissue. The Breast Cancer Fund in San Francisco is sup-porting this research. Earlier studies showed that Artemesiaannua and capillaries have direct cytotoxic effects in vivo without causing immunosuppression. 91 While Debu Tripathy was an oncologist at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), he conducted an on-goingplacebo-controlled randomized trial for women with breast can-cer, using a formula containing 21 Chinese herbs to investigatethe alleviation of common side effects of chemotherapy, namelynausea, vomiting, fatigue, marrow suppression, risk of infection,and hair loss. 92 Safety and Herb-Drug Interactions Herb safety and herb-drug interactions are complex and controversial issues. With the increasing use of herbs byWesterners has come legitimate concern for potential abuse andtoxicity. The safety of a drug, herb, or food is always relative andcontextual. Safety is determined by defining the conditionsunder which a substance is considered to be safe or dangerous,and weighing potential benefits against possible short and long-term adverse effects. Herb-drug interaction is a similar puzzle: allsubstances that enter the body interact with each other, ultimate-ly affecting all body processes. The issue again is determining thebenefit or detriment of such interactions. Compared to the record of approved pharmaceutical drugs, with a few well-known exceptions such as Aconitum carmichaelie (fu zi ), fang and Ephedra sinica (ma huang ), Chinese medici- nal herbs are safer. 93Aconite contains aconitine, a recognized poison, that is traditionally detoxified by boiling and thencombined with other herbs such as Zingiberis officinale uralensis (gan cao ) that further mitigate its toxicity, yielding important therapeuticbenefits. For example treated Aconite is combined with Panax ginseng in the treatment of acute cardiac failure. Cinnabaris , a crude ore, contains mercuric oxide and although consideredunsafe by American standards, is still utilized in small doses inChina for the short-term treatment of acute mental agitationwithout negative consequences. Many Aristolochia species have recently been shown to exert carcinogenic effects when usedcontinuously for longer than 6 months, yet these species con-tinue to be used in China with good results in the treatment ofcancer and nephropathy, the very conditions for which theyhave been considered causative agents in the West. Ephedra sinica (ma huang ) has appropriately been used as an anti-asth- matic, antitussive diaphoretic and vasodilating component ofnumerous pulmonary and anti-arthritic formulas for centuries. In the US over the past two decades, Ephedra has been inap- propriately marketed over-the-counter as a natural energy andweight loss stimulant, resulting in incidences of high blood pres-sure, palpitations, agitation, and insomnia. It is unfortunate thatabuse and misuse have caused herbs such as these to become lessavailable to professional health care providers, and have cast adark shadow over the credibility and safety of Chinese medicinalherbs in general. The hundreds of herbs that are in common use in China and the West are rarely associated with adverse effects that arenot easily reversible. These effects are seldom serious andinclude such transient reactions as: nausea, indigestion, diar-rhea, headache, dizziness, hot flashes, chills, and rashes that arerapidly abated by discontinued use or dose reduction. The pre-ponderance of evidence shows that when used as an adjunct toconventional medicine, Chinese herbs both enhance the desiredeffects and mitigate the harmful ones. Sophisticated monitoring with biological testing, steriliza- tion, and spectrographic analyses by manufacturers in theUnited States is insuring that herbal products are free of chemi-cal contaminants, adulterants, pathogens, and substitutions.This heightened awareness along with stringent standards isencouraging Chinese manufacturers to adopt the good manufac-turing practices (GMP) required by the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). There is a paucity of data that describes the interactions between pharmaceutical agents, and even less between herbsand drugs. A few herbs and foods have well understood interac-tions with drugs. Tetracycline absorption can be impeded bymilk-based foods, whereas grapefruit juice increases the bloodvolume of certain drugs (antidepressants, John's Wort, tian ji huang ) reduces blood levels of protease inhibitors by increasing their metabolism, while potentiating the effects of MAO and SSRI anti-depressants by elevating seratonin levels. Green vegetables high inVitamin K can oppose the blood-thinning action of drugs likeHeparin, Coumadin, or Angelica mote microcirculation and inhibit platelet aggregation, they canChinese Medicine and Cancer Care ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Sept/oct 2003, VOL. 9, NO. 5 51potentiate the effects of qi because of its immuno-stimulating properties, may counter the immunosuppressive action of anti-rejection drugslike Cyclosporin. In high doses, Glycyrrhiza uralensis (licorice)( gan cao) can mimic the action of cortisol, elevating blood pressure and increasing fluid retention. 94These findings are based on the use of these herbs as single agents. When Angelica sinensis is incorporated into a formula such as Shi Quan Da Bu Tang , which supplements qi and blood and activates circulation, its hematopoietic properties are enhanced and its anti-coagulant properties are reduced by the inclusion of herbs such asRehmannia glutinosa (di huang ) and Peonia lactiiflora (bai shao ), making it an effective treatment for the anemia, bruising, andbleeding caused by radiation and chemotherapy. One of the sideeffects of standard anti-coagulant therapy is anemia. To solve thisproblem with Chinese medicine, the herbs Panax pseudoginseng (tian qi ) and Millettia reticulata (ji xue ) are and anti-hemorrhagicproperties. Glycyrrhiza uralensis (licorice, gan cao ) is ubiquitous, appearing in countless formulas in part because of its ability tomodulate adrenal function. For example, the Decoction ofBupleurum ) and Poria cocos (fu ling , Chai Ling Tang ) contains many herbs, including Glycyrrhiza uralensis (gan cao ), and is used to aid in the withdrawal from corticosteroid dependence. 95 Rather than suggesting that people stop eating grapefruit or green vegetables, new information is broadening our understand-ing of the complexity of drug-food and drug-herb combinations,enhancing our ability to make prudent choices. Biologist SubhutiDharmananda, PhD, suggests, \"Herb-drug interactions may be minimized by having patients take the herbs and drugs at differenttimes (one hour apart to avoid direct interaction in the digestivetract; 1.5 hours to avoid maximum blood levels of drug and herbat the same time). The dosage of herbs that are aimed therapeuti-cally at the same function as the drugs (eg both are sedatives; bothare hypoglycemics; both are anti-coagulants) should be reduced toalleviate concerns about additive or synergistic effects that are toogreat. A certain level of additive effects might be desired in caseswhere the drug therapy is not producing the desired response.\" 96 Fundamentally, Chinese medicine is concerned with the behav- ior of qi. Consequently, all of the major modalities of Chinese medi- cine (acupuncture, herbal medicine, dietetics, qigong) are employed to provoke the qito reorder itself once a pathological process has begun and, ideally, before it has become clinically manifest. WhileChinese medicine has developed its own sophisticated repertoire oftreatments for specific diseases, its primary emphasis is ultimatelyupon restoring and preserving the healthy function of the body.

Lazarou J, Pomeranz BH, Corey PN, Incidence of Adverse Drug Reactions in Hospitalized Patients: A Meta-analysis of prospective studies. JAMA. 1998; 279(15):1200-1205. Adverse drug reactions (ADR) have become the USA's fourth-biggest killer. The results of39 studies of adverse drug reactions suggest that they could affect as many as 2.2 millionhospital patients a year, causing 106,000 deaths. This is equivalent to 4.6% of all recordeddeaths. These incidence figures are probably conservative, the researchers add, since theirADR definition did not include patient outcomes linked to errors in drug administration,overdoses, drug abuse and therapeutic failures. 94.
