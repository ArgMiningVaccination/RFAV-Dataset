Executive Summary Namibia has, for the decade beginning with Independence in 1990, pursued a development path guided by four strategic objectives: Reviving and sustaining economic growth; Reducing inequality; Creating employment; and Eradicating poverty. The social and economic outcomes on the four objectives, over the decade have been mixed. Per capita economic growth has been anaemic, averaging 0.57% 1999 over 1990. Jobs have been created, but unemployment has changed little from the 33.7% recorded in 1991; job creation and poverty reduction remain real challenges as we enter the twenty first century. GRN is well aware of these issues, and is pursuing policies and multiple strategies to address these challenges. NDP2, reaffirming the continued relevance of the above four development pillars will add three others, embracing gender, equality, equity, reducing regional development inequalities and good governance. Vision2030, the National Poverty Reduction Action Programme, the linking of employment creation with higher education technology and vocational training are all parts of the framework being developed to confront these hard to tackle problems. Combating poverty in the shortest possible emerges as an imperative. Poverty reduction has been one of the four key areas in the GRN's interventions since independence. After extensive consultations and deliberations among stake holders (GRN, Donors, UN Agencies, NGO's etc.) over the period 4 July to 30 August 2000 it was reaffirmed that the focus of the UNDAF will be poverty reduction in its various forms: income poverty, inequality, access, voicelessness, human resource and public service deficits. HIV/AIDS has emerged as a major destructive force with prevalence rates of 17.4 % in the 15 - 45 age group1. The pandemic threatens to undo the development gains over the decade following Independence, and will, in short order, compound the poverty and fledging human resource base of Namibia. The United Nations (UN) System in Namibia, reflecting on the prospects and in dialogue with Government, civil society associations and donors, have converged upon the following strategic objectives over the near-term, namely to assist the Government and the people of Namibia to: reduce poverty, inequality, food insecurity, and to provide an environment conducive of health, in particular that of women and children, reproductive health and well- being, economic growth and the respect of human rights; combat and contain the spread of HIV/AIDS, to assess the social cost(s) and to assist in the mitigation of the effects on the infected and affected; and 1 Source: Epidemiological Report on HIV/AIDS for the Year 1999 by the MoHSS. The figures are based on a survey on HIV prevalence in pregnant women in all 13 regions of Namibia. The highest infection rate of 34 % was observed in Oshakati and the lowest of 6 % in Opuwo.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 9 of 134 assist in strengthening the capacity of the Namibian Government to implement the Declarations, Conventions and Accords ratified by Namibia as a member of the Family of Nations in support and furtherance of the fundamental human rights of the Namibian people. The United Nations (UN) System in Namibia shall focus on the highest level of interventions at the policy and programme/project levels to achieve sustainable capacity and capability development. The UN Country Team shall co-ordinate its inputs as per the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF), and will develop joint tracking and review methodologies to guide the separate and joint evaluation process. Donor co-ordination in general, along with UN System co-ordination in particular, emerge as important activities, particularly so in light of a rapidly declining aid flows to Namibia. This is particularly critical as Namibia, with 65% of the population subsisting on less than US$ 150 per annum, is classified as a middle-income developing country, with an average income of around US$ 2,000. This duality is most palpable, and demands the most rigorous attention to policy detail and implementation. As its medium- to long-term developmental focus, UNDAF, in the Namibian context, will converge on a combined effort by the UN System to reduce poverty guided by a human rights approach to development2. Because of the far-reaching impact of the pandemic on all poverty reduction and development efforts , UN Agencies will simultaneously continue to assist in containin g the immediate crisis and potential catastrophic situation posed by HIV/AIDS . While the focus of UN actions will be on poverty reduction and HIV/AIDS, all actions of the UN System, within the mandates of its respective Agencies, will remain authoritative contributions intended to enhance the sustainability of the more direct poverty reduction interventions, aimed largely at income poverty and inequality reduction, that will be initiated by GRN, Non-Government Organisations and external funding agencies, especially those interventions directed at the promotion of gender equality, human rights, democracy, good governance, transparency and accountability, compliance with international standards, equity, environmental sustainability, community empowerment and partnerships between Government and civil society. Initially, UNDAF for Namibia, in a country specific approach to development planning, will concentrate on the strategic positioning of the UN System in anticipation of the completion of the Second National Development Plan (March 2001) and National Long- Term Vision 2030 (mid 2001). It will guide UN Agencies to b uild on their common and individual comparative advantages in order to enhance their capacity to make a more targeted consequential impact on the reduction of poverty and the containment of the accelerating spread of HIV/AIDS , basing its interventions through the UN Country Team on a human rights approach to development . Once the Second National Development 2 For an expanded treatment of a human rights approach to development, refer to Annex 1.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 10 of 134Plan and Namibia's Long-term Vision 2030 have become operational, the UN Agencies will review current interventions and develop separate, parallel or joint programmes within the guidelines of Namibia's medium-term plan and long-term vision. In recognition of its global mandates, its comparative advantages and the available human and financial resources, the Namibian Government and the UN System have agreed to focus future UN development co-operation increasingly on initiatives at the highest possible institutional level. The UNDAF formulation process pointed to various opportunities that will be explored in order to strengthen the UN System's operations in Namibia. The options that exist include the strengthening of Government's capacity in service delivery, in assessing the effectiveness of policy measures and in increasing aid flows to the country. Taking full advantage of its comparative advantages, interventions at the highest possible level are performed within the framework of the UN System's mandates and comparative advantages, within the structures of Namibia's medium- and long-term development plans and visions and in accordance with its institutional arrangements. The interventions will have a consequential, focused, unique, co-ordinated and sustainable impact on the reduction of poverty through decreased inequalities, increased access to public goods and services and enhanced community institutional and human capabilities. In addition, concerted efforts will be made to contain the spread of HIV/AIDS in Namibia. One important issue that emerged from the UNDAF process discussions was the complementarities of the UN actors in situ , reflecting the historical mandates of certain Agencies, e.g. UNESCO and WHO complemented by the newer specialised mandates that reflect recent and/or emerging focal issues, e.g. UNICEF and UNFPA which have responsibilities for specific subgroups e.g. women and children and reproductive health, respectively, acting as operating agents within the technical remit of WHO (health) and UNESCO (education). As such, for example, WHO provides the technical standards etc. within which UNICEF and UNFPA function. UNESCO provides the framework within which interventions in education and training take place; similarly for FAO regarding agriculture. Dialogue within UN Country Team regarding both poverty and HIV/AIDS will be conducted within the respective Theme Groups, supported by seven technical working groups: health; gender and human rights; communication, youth and education; mitigation; food security; economic empowerment; basic education and communication. The reduction to two theme groups, down from the four established in 1998, reflected the need to conserve on scarce Agency Head's time. The health, and gender and human rights technical working groups will serve both the poverty and HIV/AIDS theme groups, thus facilitating the cross-cutting nature of the themes. These theme groups are chaired and co-chaired by Agency Heads with substantive responsibility and/or competence for the thematic areas and will be rotated on a calendar year basis. For the current year, the poverty theme group will be chaired by UNDP and co-chaired by FAO; the HIV/AIDS theme group will be chaired by UNFPA and co-chaired by WHO. The technical workingUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 11 of 134groups will report through the theme groups to the Heads of Agencies. Detailed terms of reference have been developed for all groups. The above structure was agreed upon at an Agency Heads retreat of April 26-29th 2000 at which the following 1998 UN mission statement was re-adopted: The UN System in Namibia exists to promote, support and monitor policy formulation, implementation and accountability in terms of international development norms and values, with particular reference to UN International Conferences, Conventions and Human Rights Standards. To this end, the UN System will use its limited programme resources for strategic and catalytic interventions to develop management capacity for sustainable human development in response to national priorities with particular focus on poverty, inequity, and HIV/AIDS reduction. The UN's view of development is people-centred with emphasis on poverty reduction and the elimination of inequalities. Accordingly, the role of the UN System in Namibia has been to advocate those policies and programmes that underscore the dignity of people and the equality of rights of men and women. The human rights based approach to development will be an important area of advocacy, involving decentralisation, participation of beneficiaries and an integrated approach to development. Some Agencies are well along in their programming for the next cycle, while others will need to await the outcome of the Second National Development Plan. UNDAF will therefore be an important point of departure for programming by the UN Country Team. A significant aspect of this new framework will be the development of tracking indicators. Time did not permit the exploration of sub-regional issues, that would involve the UN and other Agencies beyond Namibian borders. These issues will, however, be explored during the programming phase of the country programmes. One important outcome of the UNDAF discussions has been the decision by the Namibian Government to seek Cabinet approval of the UNDAF document. This reflects the importance Government attaches to the UN framework being proposed, and very importantly, it provides the seal of ownership that Government accords the process and framework agreed upon. The Namibian Government expects a more effective and coherent UN presence and partnership in the years ahead under the UNDAF framework. The non-resident UN Agencies will be sent copies of the agreed UNDAF document forthwith for their information and inputs. A decision will have to be made regarding the disposition of instruments such as the Country Strategy Note, the Comprehensive Development Framework and other common or Agency-specific instruments.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 12 of 134There was good Donor participation in this process and much discussion centred around both the financial capability of Namibia to pursue a more robust poverty reduction strategy and the desirability of the UNCT to advocate for the continuation of the \"as if LDC\" status for Namibia. A strong recommendation from this dialogue was that the UNCT should actively pursue the latter course, while assisting GRN to do the former. We would be remiss. if we did not record the repeatedly expressed view from all parties, that the timing of the UNDAF exercise was unfortunate in view of the simultaneous NDP2 and Vision 2030 processes. Wise counsel prevailed, however, and it is probably true to say that, with the dedication and understanding exhibited by all concern, and the skillfull use of dialogue, consultations and material extent, this UNDAF process proved a very successful exercise, and might even provide some light to the ongoing GRN planning processes. Finally a strong recommendation went forth for UNDP led donor Co-ordination and UN Resident Coordinator led UNCT Co-ordination.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 13 of 134II. Rationale of UNDAF for Namibia A. The Namibian Development Planning Process The United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF), as is the case with all externally funded development co-operation programmes, will be synchronised, as far as possible, with the Namibian development planning process. Development planning in Namibia has been defined in the First National Development Plan (NDP1) as the deliberate attempt by the Government of the Republic of Namibia (GRN) to co-ordinate economic and social decision-making processes to influence, directly and indirectly, economic and social development. The planning process is the exercise in which GRN, in consultation with its social partners, first chooses its economic and social objectives, sets indicative targets, and finally organises a framework for implementing, coordinating and monitoring the development plan. GRN has recognised the positive contribution planning can make on the operations and activities of a free market mechanism and is committed to use this important management instrument for accelerating the country's development process. Some of the functions of the planning system, as described in NDP1, include the following: co-ordinate economic policy to create an enabling environment for accelerating and diversifying Namibia's economy and the development process in general; undertake strategic investments in high risk areas unattractive to the private sector investors; set indicative targets and priorities for economic growth in order to give guidance to all participants in the process of economic development; and plan and manage Government's own activities and ensure that they are oriented towards national goals and make the best use of available financial, human and natural resources. GRN has decided to produce a National Development Plan every five years starting from the beginning of the 1995/96 financial year. NDP1 and subsequent National Development Plans (NDP) contain details of the activities of all central Government Offices, Ministries and Agencies, and its preparation is co-ordinated by the National Planning Commission Secretariat (NPCS) in co-operation with line Ministries. The NDP outlines GRN's broad medium-term objectives, strategies, macroeconomic frameworks, policies, recurrent and investment programmes as well as measurable targets for each sector of Government activity.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 14 of 134A Public Sector Investment Programme (PSIP) is produced alongside the National Development Plan within the macroeconomic framework of the Plan. The PSIP sets out a five-year programme of identified investment projects for the public sector, including projects funded outside the State Revenue Fund and projects still to be funded. Implementation of NDP is the responsibility of all sections of Government. For each sector, NDP sets out policies, priorities and programmes which will be followed and it is the responsibility of the National Planning Commission (NPC) and the Ministry of Finance together with the public officers in line Ministries and Regional Councils to ensure that the stated policies and programmes are implemented during the five year period. The compilation of Namibia's Second National Development Plan (NDP2), covering the period 2000/2001 to 2005/2006 has commenced, and it is expected that a first draft will be finalised during September 2000. NDP2 will, in all probability, be endorsed by Cabinet and approved by Parliament by March 2001. Once completed and adopted, it is anticipated that NDP2 will represent an important improvement on NDP1. The four national development objectives have been retained, namely: sustainable economic growth and development; reducing inequalities in income distribution; creation of employment; and poverty reduction (opposed to poverty eradication, as stated in NDP1). However, NDP2 aims to address additional cross-cutting issues such as: gender equality and equity; sustainable natural resource management; reducing regional inequalities; and good governance. Whereas NDP1 represented, in essence, a reflection on developmental issues as perceived by line Ministries within their respective mandates, NDP2 will make an improved effort to integrate cross-cutting issues that affect sustainable development in each chapter and in a participatory manner. In addition, separate chapters will be dedicated to regional development and national concerns, such as poverty, HIV/AIDS, gender, income distribution, governance, rural development, food security, environment, information technology, science and technology, civil society, decentralisation and commercialisation.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 15 of 134The donor community extensively supports the NDP2 formulation process. The UN System is assisting in compiling and reviewing information on development co-operation, population, health, sanitation, commercialisation, private sector development, environment, gender, good governance, HIV/AIDS, food security, etc. In addition to the NDP2 drafting exercise, GRN has embarked on the formulation of a National Long-Term Vision 2030 (Vision 2030) to guide future development plans by effectively linking long-term perspectives to short- and medium-term planning. Vision 2030 will provide, by way of a participatory approach, long-term alternative policy scenarios on the future course of development at different points in time until the target year 2030. The scenarios to be developed on key national issues include: inequalities and social welfare; political stability, peace and sustainable development; human resources, institutional and capacity building; macro-economic issues; population, health and development; natural resources and environment; knowledge, information and technology; and factors of the external environment. It is foreseen that Vision 2030 will be completed towards the middle of 2001. Pivotal to the planning and implementation processes of NDP2 and Vision 2030 is the NPC, established under Article 129 of the Namibian Constitution \"to plan the priorities and directions of national development\". The NPCS was created at Independence. The NPCS services the Commission as well as the Office of the Director-General. The NPCS has a prime responsibility for preparing and coordinating annual, medium- and long-term national development plans, for coordinating external assistance and the Development Budget, and for monitoring progress on development programmes and projects, while line Ministries are solely responsible for the actual execution of development programmes. Given its mandate and function, the NPC and its Secretariat are fundamental to the efforts of the UN System.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 16 of 134B. UNDAF and the Namibian Development Planning Process As has been stated above, it is anticipated that NDP2 and Vision 2030 will be completed by March and June 2001, respectively. For Namibia, these two initiatives will ultimately determine the direction of development initiatives, policies and programmes until the 2005/2006 financial year, and, as far as Vision 2030 is concerned, beyond 2006. In view of the above target dates, the timing of the formulation of UNDAF allow UN Agencies sufficient time to equip themselves in order to have an even greater influence on the guiding principles of development in Namibia. NDP2 and Vision 2030 provide an opportunity for UN Agencies to arrange themselves, with the help of a common development assistance framework and in close co-operation with GRN, civil society and the donor community, to face the challenges of assisting in the implementation of a medium-term plan within the guidance of a long-term vision. In order to appreciate the role that UNDAF can play in giving the UN System a renewed impetus in advancing the core missions of the UN System, the development objectives of the UN in Namibia have to be considered before measures can be put in place that aim to increase the impact of the UN System in Namibia. C. The United Nations System in Namibia For the successful accomplishment of the UNDAF principle to maximise complementarity and impact of individual programmes, Co-ordination of the various activities will be as important as co-operation between UN Agencies. The UN System, through the Common Country Assessment (CCA), has taken the first step towards the harmonisation and Co-ordination of its various interventions. The CCA has enabled all UN Agencies to utilise a common data- and information base. During 1998 four thematic groups were established. Technical committees drawn from these Agencies support the groups, involving FAO, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNICEF, and WHO. The Theme Groups were on HIV/AIDS (chaired by UNFPA), Poverty (chaired by FAO), Gender (chaired by UNICEF), and Health, Population and Nutrition (chaired by WHO). The Theme Groups allow consultation on substantive matters and provide the opportunity to explore ways of pooling resources and services to achieve maximum programme and policy impact. 1. The Common Country Assessment (CCA) Various international conferences have addressed areas affecting sustainable human development. The cross-cutting and common themes that emanated from these global conferences required shared policy approaches to ensure effective follow-up at the country level. To deal with the pressing issues that emerged from the global consensus, a common analysis of Namibia's socio-political and economic situation as well as on the development challenges had to be formulated. For Namibia, the ensuing CCA of 1999,United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 17 of 134identified the following specific challenges and opportunities for development co- operation: A Human Rights Perspective to Development : A human rights approach to development will be promoted which gives emphasis to liberty, justice, equality, solidarity and empowerment. Envisaged actions include ensuring compliance with international principles by focusing on the empowerment of communities, whilst at the same time promoting a just and legal political and economic environment. Sustaining Employment-Intensive Economic Performance and Growth : The aim is to ensure a macro-economic framework that is guided by economic and population policies and programmes that enhance growth. Capacity Building - Human, Institutional and Community : The UN System will provide assistance at the macro level to ensure that policies and programmes for the creation of adequate capacity are in place. In addition, each Agency will assist in management capacity building programmes at sectoral and institutional levels. At the community level, UN Agencies will support capacity building to increase participation in decision-making. Consolidation and Deepening of Quality Social Service Delivery : The UN System will support efforts to consolidate and expand social service by promoting popular participation with special emphasis on the involvement of young people as agents of change. Several interventions are envisaged and implemented such as facilitating access to information through communication, strengthening links between Government services and communities, supporting the decentralisation process, capacity building in especially the areas of data collection and analysis, and in the management of basic services. In addition, the UN System interventions are aimed at facilitating partnerships between GRN and civil society organisations. Poverty reduction and Enlargement of Opportunities for Equitable Sustainable Livelihoods : The UN will focus its attention on promoting equal opportunities and it will focus its interventions on those most disadvantaged or most at risk. Containing the Threat of HIV/AIDS : The UN will support GRN's strategic plan in the areas of communication with a special focus on young people. Other interventions include the improvement of health services, the distribution of condoms, assistance in the development of a home-based care system, developing a strategy to care for children orphaned by AIDS and support to a legal framework that would guarantee the human rights of people living with HIV/AIDS. Environment: The UN System will continuously promote the sustainable utilisation of natural resources.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 18 of 134The above-mentioned areas of intervention, identified jointly by GRN, UN Agencies and civil society during the CCA, constitute the common basis for further planning and programming activities. As such, the CCA provides the foundation for the instruments to be employed by the UN Agencies for their development co-operation programmes in Namibia within the framework of UNDAF. 2. Theme Groups The establishment of the Theme Groups has facilitated collaboration and Co-ordination between the UN Agencies. As a result, there has been less duplication of efforts and greater complementarily and coherence in the implementation of the programmes and policies. The establishment of a working group on the environment will be considered under UNDAF. The close collaboration in and between the Theme Groups has resulted in: the preparation of a CCA; a study on the follow -up to UN conferences; the Namibian Human Development Report; the Country Strategic Note (CSN); the joint programming on poverty reduction in the Ohangwena Region, which contributed to the formulation of a National Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS); the HIV/AIDS prevention programme, which has not only brought about a new sense of urgency and realism on the subject but has also strengthened collaboration between GRN and UN Agencies on fighting the pandemic; and the FAO -led publicity on Women Feed the World and UNICEF's campaign on violence against women. 3. Collaboration with the Bretton Woods Institutions The UNDP has collaborated with the Bretton Woods institutions. Collaboration with the IMF resulted, amongst others, in the establishment of the Bank of Namibia and the operational strengthening of the Ministry of Finance. Collaboration with the World Bank, lead to the development of a national strategy on poverty alleviation and to a national human resources capacity assessment. 4. International Conventions The report of the UN System on Namibia's follow-up to the UN Conferences, which was published in October 1998, was officially launched during a panel discussion to mark the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty on 18 October 1999. The publication ofUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 19 of 134the 1999 CCA also saw the UN Country Team working closely with GRN to develop and update indicators for monitoring Namibia's progress in relation to meeting the goals of the Conferences. International Conference on Population and Development : In terms of national progress towards meeting the goals and targets of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), UNFPA collaborated with UNICEF and WHO to assist in the drafting of a reproductive health policy. So far, Namibia has had mixed results in achieving the targets as can be deducted from the following indicators3: the infant mortality rate increased from 61 per 1,000 live births in 1990 - 1995 to a projected 65 per 1,000 live births for the period 1995 - 2000. The ICPD target is 50 per 1,000 live births by 2000; the under-5 mortality rate in 1996 was estimated to be 77 deaths per 100,000 live births. The ICPD target is to 70 per 1,000 live births by 2000; the maternal mortality rate was 225 per 100,000 live births in 1992. The ICPD threshold is 100 per 100,000 live births. In 1996, there were 77 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in health institutions. However, only around half of births take place in health institutions; the contraceptive prevalence rate was 29% in the period 1986 - 1992. The ICPD threshold is 55%; in 1996, 55% of the population had access to health care within one hour. The ICPD threshold is 60%; and life expectancy at birth for both sexes decreased from 58.5 years in 1990 - 1995 to 52.4 years in 1995 - 2000. The ICPD target is 70 years by 2005. Namibia has, however, made steady progress and actually met the ICPD targets for the number of deliveries attended by trained health personnel, the gross female enrolment rate at the primary level, and the adult female literacy rate. World Summit for Children: UNICEF and WHO worked together to support the country's efforts to meet targets set for Extended Programme on Immunisation (EPI), Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI), Mother to Child Transmission (MTCT), Reproductive Health (RH), Adolescent Friendly Reproductive Health Services, Malaria Control, Nutrition, Water Supply and Sanitation. Collaboration was mainly in the areas of advocacy, policy development, planning, and training for capacity building. The first three indicators listed in the ICPD section above also refer to the World Summit for Children. 3 Source: UNFPA draft on Third Country Programme, August 2000United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 20 of 134With regard to the implementation of IMCI, WHO and UNICEF regional ICMI advisors worked as a team to support the country efforts in programme development. This was also the case in malaria control, where both WHO and UNICEF consultants worked together on a field-based needs assessment and programme review. World Food Summit : As a follow-up to the World Food Summit, FAO's focus continued to be the alleviation of poverty and ensuring food security in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Rural Development (MAWRD), Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources, Ministry of Lands, Resettlement and Rehabilitation (MLRR), and the Directorate of Forestry of the Ministry of Environment and Tourism. National awareness of the problem of food insecurity in Namibia grew, and various stakeholders are mobilised to focus attention on the issue. Through a cross-sectoral consultative process, nutritional guidelines have been developed, based on indigenous foods and the availability of different foods in the various regions of the country. World Food Day (16 October), with the Theme of \"Youth against Hunger,\" was celebrated in all 13 Regions with participation from the private and public sectors, NGOs, media and the policy makers. UNICEF and UNFPA supported the World Food Day/TeleFood events. In the area of food security, FAO has assisted GRN in its effort to address problems of food insecurity and malnutrition through the Co-ordination of efforts, mobilisation of resources, institutional strengthening and human resources development. Namibia has been selected for the pilot inter-agency Food Insecurity and Vulnerability Mapping System (FIVMS) project. FAO has assisted the Food Security and Nutrition Council through its Technical Committee and the Secretariat to complete the 1999 update of the National Food Security and Nutrition Assessment. UNICEF and WHO are represented on the Committee. World Conference on Human Rights: In collaboration with a national task force, UNESCO continued to work on the integration of knowledge and values on human rights and democracy through teacher training and text books for use at the primary and secondary levels. A teacher-training guide on Teaching on Human Rights and Democracy in Southern Africa, and a Namibia specific textbook with student worksheets were developed. UNDP and the Office of the UN High Commissioner also hosted a regional workshop for Eastern and Southern Africa on Human Rights and Sustainable Development. Launching of the International Year of the Culture of Peace: The Namibia National Commission of UNESCO and UNESCO/Windhoek organised an event to mark this launching, with the participation of the President of the Republic of Namibia. Other resident Agencies also participated. A national committee has been established to undertake activities for the International Year of the Culture of Peace and to prepare for the International Decade of a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children. Girls' Education: Namibia is one of eighteen African countries that receive funds from the Norwegian Government in support of the African Girls Education Initiative (AGEI).United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 21 of 134With this support, UNICEF's education programmes have been designed to focus on the provision of opportunities for marginalised children, especially girls, to capture those who so far have been left out. UNICEF has provided major inputs to the Presidential Commission on Education, including briefings, discussion groups and revisions, to ensure that issues of marginalisation, popular participation, HIV/AIDS, and the importance of Early Childhood Care and Development received due attention in the recommendations. In realisation of its various mandates, the UN System co-operated with the Namibian civil society to assist in institutional capacity building and on the enshrinement of human rights and gender issues. 5. Civil Society Collaboration, Gender Issues, Environmental Concerns a) Civil Society Collaboration The UN Agencies in Namibia have built partnerships in a number of areas with community-based organisations and the private sector. These partnerships are numerous and varied, and include: UNICEF and UNAIDS collaboration involving the Legal Assistance Centre on juvenile justice, orphans' legal rights, HIV/AIDS and human rights, and inheritance issues, and with UNESCO on human rights education. Both have also collaborated with Catholic AIDS Action on home-based care and prevention programmes. On gender issues, UNICEF supports various women's organisations, especially in activities dealing with problems facing the girl-child. UNFPA support to the Namibian Planned Parenthood Association (NAPPA) and community-based organisations in the North West Health Directorate. UNESCO and UNAIDS collaborated with the Namibian National Teachers Union (NANTU), providing training to under- and unqualified teachers and HIV/AIDS counselling, respectively. As part of its support for Micro and Small Enterprise Development, UNDP has strengthened the capacity of the relevant local NGOs in order to establish an enabling environment for the development of SMEs. This programme is highly relevant to Namibia's efforts to reduce poverty and to provide options for non- agricultural economic empowerment. UNDP provided technical assistance to various other private sector and civil society organisations like the Katutura Youth Enterprise Centre, the National Development Council and the Namibia National Association of Women in Business, as well as establishing partnerships with several international andUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 22 of 134community-based NGOs as part of its efforts to experiment with a wide range of approaches for poverty reduction. The UN System is supporting the decentralisation process and an informal group has been formed to act as a forum to facilitate the exchange of news and information. The Ford Foundation has entrusted UNDP with the management of funds in support of NGOs to carry out civic education for decentralisation. Being an operational-level apparatus of the UN Theme Group, the Technical Working Group (TWG) on Communication, Youth and Education took the initiative in establishing the Task Force for the Namibian HIV/AIDS Media Campaign. The TWG provides logistical and technical support for this result- oriented Task Force, which includes both private sector and civil society members. The Task Force for the Namibian HIV/AIDS Media Campaign enjoys a close partnership among the UN Agencies (through the TWG), GRN counterparts, private sector and NGOs. The partnership extends to the National AIDS Co- ordination Programme, the national telecommunication company, public TV/radio, private radio stations, commercial media production companies, the Windhoek Municipality, the Department of Print Media of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Information and Broadcasting, a community radio station in northern Namibia, the Red Cross, youth organisations, NGOs in AIDS care and prevention, a Catholic organisation, and the Information, Education and Communication (IEC) division of the Ministry of Health and Social Services (MoHSS). Since the launch of its campaign on October 1999, the Task Force has produced several multimedia campaign materials that carry the official campaign logo, including a series of TV spots and posters in seven local languages, billboards, stickers, etc. b) Gender Issues The Resident Coordinator system promoted gender issues through support for public lectures on gender-based topics during the University of Namibia's (UNAM) evening courses, organised by the Gender and Development Unit of the Multidisciplinary Research Centre. Various Agency representatives participated. The Gender Theme Group formulated a strategy based on a \"gender relations approach.\" The first activity has been the preparation of a brochure describing UN System and national activities for Beijing and Beijing+5. An evaluation is planned to assess the extent of women's participation in the Ohangwena Poverty Reduction Programme and in the national strategic plan of action on HIV/AIDS. UNICEF continues its work with the Multi-media Campaign on Violence Against Women and Children to ensure increased awareness among policy makers and legal experts on the rising problem of abuse of women and children. Countrywide, UNICEF supports the Women and Child Protection Units to ensure that victims of abuse receive effective and efficient services as well as follow-up counselling. The Annual InformationUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 23 of 134Sharing Forum, organised by the former Department of Women Affairs, and the production and dissemination of the Beijing+5 Report received support from UNICEF. As part of its support to the Good Governance Programme, UNDP, together with UNESCO is involved in a Support to Technical Services (STS) project, which will provide for in-country training of prosecutors, police and social workers to establish sexual offence courts in Namibia. Other donors are the United States and the Netherlands. UNDP has also funded the publication of a series of lectures, held at UNAM, on Gender and Development in Namibia held at UNAM. c) Environmental Concerns At the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (Earth Summit) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, consensus was reached that social and economic development can no longer be considered separately from the environment. Moreover, it has become increasingly apparent that it is essential to integrate poverty-reducing and environmental conservation efforts. The poor experience the most debilitating effects of environmental degradation. This is especially apparent in Namibia with its fragile environmental base for all life, and the base for subsistence and economic activities, including agriculture, fisheries, tourism and mining. In view of this, any UN effort aimed at improving peoples' lives has to be sustainable rather than an \"emergency solution\". It is, therefore, imperative that environmental concerns form an integral part of decision-making processes. Both NDP1 and NDP2 have clearly recognised this point. Discussions, during which UNDP actively participated, held in preparation of NDP2, reflected on the damage to the natural resources already done by policies and unsustainable developments in the past. The requirement to improve on NDP1 by considering cross-sectoral and sustainability issues in order to avoid repetition of the mistakes, has been stressed. During the formulation of individual NDP2 chapters, the condition that future economic developments should aim at long-term progress rather than opt for environmentally unsustainable short-term solutions will be taken into account. Under UNDAF, the type of activities mentioned above, will greatly enhance the sustainability of the poverty reduction activities. 6. Advocacy UN advocacy programmes have done much to raise public and private awareness of key UN themes and concepts. However, under UNDAF, the level of understanding among the general public of the UN's role in Namibia will be raised. All UN Agencies will strive for an even higher degree of visibility, not necessarily through direct projects, but by means of increased participation in public discussions (land issue, human rights, environment, marginalised groups, UN mandates and objectives, etc.), and more concerted efforts will be made to utilise the resources offered by the United Nations Information CentreUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 24 of 134(UNIC). In addition, GRN will actively co-operate to strengthen the effectiveness and coherence of the UN System as will be illustrated in a later section of this document. The Agency Heads retreat identified the main areas for strengthened collaboration among the Agencies. These were in the area of communication and programming. In this regard, the programme cycles of UNICEF, UNFPA in Namibia have already been harmonised. D. Issues that Influenced the Interventions of the United Nations It has been substantiated, especially during mid-term and country reviews, that the UN System as a whole does make a definite contribution to the direction of Namibia's development efforts, and enhancements in appropriate policy formulation and implementation have been recorded, notably with regard to good governance, gender, human rights, the environment, community empowerment, equity, employment creation, capacity building and human resources development. However, the effectiveness of the development co-operation programme of the UN System in Namibia has been shaped by several factors, including: a general shortage of financial resources within the UN System, and the tendency that these limited resources were not always employed to add value to the interventions of the UN Agencies; inadequate long-term strategic planning by GRN that would have enabled UN Agencies to focus programme interventions more consistently; limited involvement of civil society in policy making and implementation; the relatively strong presence of bilateral and multilateral donors, the low-level involvement of the World Bank, and a comparatively well co-ordinated flow of external assistance (if not at the central, most certainly at the sectoral level); this presents fewer opportunities for the United Nations system; the overall need for assistance after Independence at all levels which necessitated GRN and UN Agencies to spread their inadequate resources widely, and at times thinly, to mitigate the destructive consequences of the colonial era; and a wide-ranging downward revision in expectations regarding Namibia's overall performance, has greatly slowed down progress towards poverty, unemployment and disparity reduction, the provision of basic social services, capacity building, etc. In addition to the above, the UNDAF formulation process brought to light, and the UN System will address, the cross-cutting concerns bearing on the need for: relevant and updated research and data,United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 25 of 134 the requirement for improved co-ordination of activities, and the enhancement of the capacity needed for policy implementation. E. Developments since the Common Country Assessment Since the CCA had been concluded during 1999, GRN reconfirmed poverty as a multi- sectoral priority. In addition, there has also been an intensified awareness that the spread of the HIV/AIDS pandemic poses a real threat to sustainable poverty reduction and development interventions. Both cross-cutting issues will be dealt with in the formulation and implementation of NDP2 and Vision 2030 in a multi-sectoral approach4. 1. Socio-economic Indicators Namibia's 1999 GDP rank at 75 is 40 levels higher than its Human Development Index (HDI) rank of 115. The discrepancy in ranking between income and human development indices is a reflection of the country's apartheid past, when the education and health systems were not developed to the level one would expect in a country of 'middle income' status. The HDI for Namibia presents a more accurate picture of the realities of life in a country where income distribution is highly skewed. After slight improvements in the preceding years, the 1999 Human Development Report indicates that Namibia's HDI for 1999 dropped from .656 (revised) to .638, largely as a result of the impact of the growing HIV/AIDS epidemic on estimates of life expectancy. The selective mortality attacks of AIDS on specific age groups, such as young children and the economically active population, is already having a negative impact on the human development and poverty indices. In 1998, Namibia's Global HDI stood at 0.644 and its Global Human Poverty Index (HPI) stood at 22.4. By 1999, the Global HDI had decreased to 0.638 and the Global HPI had increased to 25.7. Namibia's 1999 Human Development rank is now 115, a drop from its 1998 position of 107 (though a revised methodology has now been applied globally). The Namibian Human Development Report 1999 also confirms large regional variations in the HDI (ranging from .468 in Caprivi to .730 in Khomas region) and the Human Poverty Index. The poverty indicators in different regions are influenced by the huge area of the country (hence long distances to health facilities), large proportions of underweight children (Khomas), poorly developed water systems (Ohangwena and Omusati), low survival rates (Caprivi), limited household budgets (Kavango and Omaheke), and illiteracy (Kunene)5. 4 Indicators for the Common Country Assessment are attached as Annex 4.5 Source: Namibian Human Development Report, 1999United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 26 of 134A more equitable distribution of income, the elimination of rural-urban disparities, and variations between regions and language groups, remain Namibia's fundamental human rights challenges. 2. Poverty Reduction The urgency of poverty reduction is acknowledged, and is based as a cross-cutting development priority, in: the Review of NDP1 and the guidelines for the formulation of NDP2; the Common Country Assessment; the Danish Co-operation for Environment and Development (DANCED) funded Project on Sustainable Development6; the overall objectives of the UN; the global goal to reduce poverty by half by 2015; and GRN's long-term goal to raise Namibia to the level of an industrialised state by the year 2030. The major development goals of NDP1 were to achieve the national targets of reducing the proportion of poor households, spending 60% of their income on food, from 47% in 1994 to 40% by 2000, and to reduce the proportion of severely poor households, spending 80% of their income on food, from 13% in 1994 to 7% by 20007. Government sources indicate that the GDP in constant prices grew by 2.6% in 1997, 2.4% in 1998 and 3.0% in 1999. Using GRN population projections, GDP per capita in constant prices declined by 0.6% in 1997 and 0.8% in 1998 but increased by 0.3% in 1999. The GNP per capita figure of US$2,110 in 1997 accorded Namibia its \"middle- income country\" status8. A national target is to reduce the population growth rate from the projected 3.2% per annum in 1995 to 3.0% by 2006 and 2.0% by the year 2025. According to GRN projections, the population of Namibia is estimated to have reached 1,816,500 by 2000 and is expected to reach 2,043,200 by 2005. According to UN projections, the population of Namibia is estimated to have grown at 2.24% per annum over the period 1995-2000 6 Joint programme between NPCS and the Directorate of Environmental Affairs of the Ministry of Environment and Tourism on \"Review of Namibia's Green Plan and the Inclusion of Sustainable Development Issues in NDP2\", funded by DANCED and expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2001.7 Source: NDP1, National Planning Commission Secretariat, 19958 Sources: UNFPA draft on Third Country Programme (August 2000) and the Namibian Human Development Report (1999)United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 27 of 134and to have reached 1,726,000 by 2000. Between 2000-2015, the average annual growth rate of the population is projected to be 1.08%, representing a reduction of 1.35% in the population growth rate due to AIDS. AIDS is estimated to have caused a loss of 40,000 people by the year 2000, representing 2.3% of the population9. a) Income and Asset Poverty By definition, households are 'relatively poor' if they devote over 60% of their expenditure to food and 'extremely poor' if such expenditure rises to 80% or more. Based on this definition, and according to the 1993/94 Namibia Household Income and Expenditure Survey, 47% of Namibian households were relatively poor and 13% were extremely poor in 1994. Poverty is concentrated among groups which historically have been disadvantaged, is disproportionately to be found among rural people, especially those in remote locations and other areas that were subject to systematic under- investment, and amongst female headed households, youth, elderly, disabled and recent migrants into marginalised urban areas. Efforts have been made to undertake a 'Living Condition Survey' to assess the poverty situation since 1994, but data analysis from that survey is still in process. However, the 1993/94 data reveal that 85% of consumption-poor households live in rural areas, 15% in urban areas. Over half of these households are subsistence farmers, living mainly in the north and north-eastern regions. Farm and domestic workers are the next biggest group of poor households, living mostly in the central and southern regions. An increasing number of the poor are urban under- and unemployed households, living in informal settlements. Many poor households rely on the state pension as an important income source10. Currently, approximately 92,000 Namibians over the age of 65 years receive N$ 200 per month, up since April 2000 from the N$ 160 that applied since 1996. In total, a further 22,000 people receive either disability-, maintenance-, or foster parent grants11. The richest 1% of households in Namibia earn more than the bottom 50% of households, 10% of the population receive 65% of aggregate income, with the remaining 90% of the population only receiving 35% of aggregate income. All this translates into a Gini coefficient of 0.70 (1996) for Namibia. Given limits to agricultural production under current agronomic practices and know-how in Namibia, economic growth and employment in the non-agricultural economy is required to provide the poor with incomes. Economic growth has averaged only \u00bd% per person from 1990-1997. Formal and informal employment is low with an unemployment rate at 20-30% of the labour force and increasing gradually. The economy has produced few employment opportunities outside of agriculture, mining and fisheries. The pre-independence economy was designed to export Namibia's natural 9 Source: draft NDP2 Chapter on Population and Development quoting targets as presented in the National Population Policy for Sustainable Human Development10 Source: Draft NDP2 chapter on Poverty Reduction and the Namibian Human Development Report, 1999.11 Ministry of Health and Social ServicesUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 28 of 134resources and to import goods from South Africa, rather than stimulating local manufacturing. It provided jobs for the few and restricted the creation of small- and medium-scale enterprises. Unemployment has been increasing from 32.9% of the labour force in 1993/1994 to 34.8% in 1997/1998, using the broad International Labor Organization (ILO) definition, and from 19.4% in 1993/1994 to 19.9% in 1997/1998, using the strict definition in terms of those actively seeking work. In 1997/1998, women constituted 44% of the formally employed sector, while men constituted 56%. The unemployment rate for people above the age of 15 was 29.1% for men and 40.5% for women12. Ownership of land is distributed highly disproportionate. Some 150,000 communal farmer households occupy 42% (33.5 million hectares) of the land, whereas 4,200 commercial farmers own 43% (36.2 million hectares) of the land. Fencing of communal pastures by the well-off into private farms further reduces access to land. Agricultural incomes for communal farmers have been further limited by historical neglect (e.g. inadequate research and extension services, access to fertiliser and other inputs, access to credit), environmental degradation and resource depletion, and veterinary restrictions on the movement of cattle. Low incomes are a major cause of poverty, which reduces the ability of the poor to meet basic needs, namely to consume an adequate diet and to invest in better shelter, to meet the costs related to education and health, i.e. all those items globally regarded as basic human rights. b) Other Dimensions of Poverty The other dimensions of poverty vary by region. Individuals in the Caprivi have the shortest life expectancy. Adult literacy and school enrolment rates are lowest in Omaheke and Kunene. Households in Omusati, Ohangwena and Okavango have the worst access to water supply. Despite having the best health services, Khomas has the second highest proportion of underweight children, while Hardap the highest ratio13. At the political level, the advancement of women can record minor improvements. By 1999, Namibian women held 33.1% of all senior positions in Government. Women constituted 19.2% of Members of Parliament, 7.7% of Members of the National Council, 16% of Cabinet Ministers, 17.6% of Deputy Ministers, 9.5% of Permanent Secretaries, 28.6% of Deputy Permanent Secretaries, 6.7% of Ambassadors, 7.7% of Regional Governors, 41.3% of Local Councillors, 16.7% of High Court Judges, and 100% of Ombudspersons14. 12 Source: UNFPA draft on Third Country Programme, August 200013 Source: Namibian Human Development Report, 199914 Source: UNFPA draft Third Country Programme, August 2000United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 29 of 134Economically, women suffer the highest rates of poverty15. Socially, they encounter a high incidence of rape and gender-based violence and abuse. Culturally, women remain unequal in status, entitlements to resources and access to decision-making16. A lack of basic schooling and information, especially for girls and women, affects the way in which households use information and financial resources to shape their dietary, fertility and health-care choices that have a strong influence on the well-being of all household members. Those lacking education and information are also less likely to know and exert their rights. In general, social services and infrastructure have been, and continue to be, under-provided in certain regions, especially the north and north-east. In 30% of households, the head of the family has no formal education, a further 32% have only a primary education. The absence of skilled jobs for the majority before Independence also implies that little or none on-the-job training took place. Namibia's high fertility rate (4.9 by 2000 according to UN estimates17) would imply large households and high dependency ratios: a few economically active adults support many children. The added impact of HIV-AIDS, with the loss of members of the economically active population, first through illness and then due to death, and the ensuing pressure on a few adults to support numerous children, greatly amplifies the effects of poverty. Changes in the sexual division of labour and the effects of migrant labour have increased the role of women, and older women in particular, in childcare and, in rural areas, in farming. This, combined with barriers to their social and legal advancement and access to services, has increased the incidence of poverty among women and female-headed households. Discussion within the UNDAF working groups concluded, with the strong view and recommendation, that the most effective strategies to reduce poverty are those that address the causes of poverty using a human rights approach, thereby empowering the poor to earn their own livelihoods, to control their own destiny and to participate fully in society. c) Namibia's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) During the formulation of NDP1, Namibia adopted the eradication of poverty as one of its national objectives. It is important to note that these days, GRN makes use of the term poverty reduction in favour of concepts such as alleviation or eradication for the following reasons: alleviation of poverty deals with the uplifting of the level of living standard of the population to above the poverty line; and 15 Source: Namibian Human Development Report, 199916 Source: draft NDP2 Chapter on Gender and Development17 Source: UNFPAUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 30 of 134 eradication of poverty implies complete absence of poverty and hence near-equal income distribution. Poverty reduction, a concept used in situations where high levels of poverty call for interventions aimed at reducing the intensity of poverty amongst the poorest, was chosen because of the concept's relevance to the Namibian situation. Although the NDP1 laid out sector-based strategies for economic development, it was realized that the challenges caused by, and the integrated approaches needed for, poverty reduction cut across the mandates of individual Ministries. For this reason, mid-way through the implementation of NDP1, the NPCS took the initiative to formulate an Integrated Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) for Namibia. Towards the end of 1998 the NPC presented Cabinet with the Draft PRS for Namibia for consideration. Cabinet approved the PRS and its implementation, and tasked the NPCS with the responsibility to compile a National Poverty Reduction Action Programme. It is expected that the Action Programme be completed towards the end of 2000. The PRS has three areas of concern. It examines: how to foster more equitable and efficient delivery of public resources (in the context of Namibia's commitment to regional decentralisation) for poverty reduction countrywide; how to accelerate equitable agricultural expansion, including consideration of food security and other crop development options; and options for non-agricultural economic empowerment, including an emphasis on informal and self-employment options. The overall objective of the National Poverty Reduction Action Programme is to provide an operational framework for the implementation of the PRS, reflecting its directions, priorities and strategy areas. The National Poverty Reduction Action Programme will be designed as a co-operative expression of all relevant GRN Ministries, civil society and external co-operation partners, and shall demonstrate a holistic and synergistic response to the social and economic requirements for effective and measurable poverty reduction. d) Identification of Poverty Reduction Development Projects The National Poverty Reduction Action Programme will identify development projects that will focus on poverty reduction, with clearly defined objectives, targets, locations, cost estimates, time frames, implementing agencies and indicators for monitoring. The Programme, during its first phase, will cover a five-year period, co-inciting with NDP2. Most programmes currently implemented (or planned) by UN Agencies concentrate on the reduction of poverty, whether directly or indirectly, but do not fall within aUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 31 of 134framework that can be implemented on a programmatic basis. When formulating projects to be implemented under the umbrella of these programmes, UNDAF will assist the UN System to focus interventions even more markedly on poverty reduction and the poor. e) The UN System's Response to Income Disparity With a GNP per capita of US$2,110 (1997), Namibia qualifies as a \"middle-income country\" in terms of allocation of resources for international development assistance. However, this figure obscures the fact that Namibia has one of the most unequal income distributions in the world. In economic terms, the \"average\" Namibian does not exist, as reference to an average income is meaningless in a society where almost no one has incomes anywhere near the average, and virtually everyone has either considerably higher, or considerably lower, incomes. Half of the population survives on approximately 10% of the average income, while 5% enjoys incomes more than five times the average. With such a disparity of income, and an unemployment rate ranging from 20% to 35%, it is clear that Namibia's classification as a middle income country is based on a very narrow view that takes into consideration the actual living standards of only a fraction of its population, ignoring the fact that the large majority of the population, more than 65%, live in absolute poverty18. Asset holdings are equally skewed. The above analysis implies that, within the context of UNDAF, poverty in Namibia is more a manifestation of a skewed sharing of resources than a lack of means. Namibia has the economic resource base to reduce poverty to the agreed level by 2015. However, assistance is required to establish an approach to development that is based on basic human rights and that will guide the process of equitable resource allocation. The UN System, with its global mandates and comparative advantages, and within the guidelines of UNDAF, will support GRN's efforts to achieve its development objectives in a sustainable, universal, accountable and participatory manner. The UN Agencies will add value to the development process, particularly to the reduction of poverty, by assisting the process of internalising a lasting relationship between duty bearers and claim-holders of rights. Because of the fact that the Ohangwena project has demonstrated the UN System's ability to collaborate on a pilot project at the regional level, employing joint programming and parallel funding mechanisms, it is worth outlining its workings with a view to possible replication. The Ohangwena Pilot Poverty Reduction Programme The Ohangwena Programme is an integrated, grass-root, multi-sectoral and agriculture- based activity, which was launched in 1997 under the auspices of the Theme Group on 18 With this distinct skewness of incomes, a more satisfactory measure of central tendency would be the median which is some US$ 150 as against the unrepresentative US$ 2,000 arithmetic average.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 32 of 134poverty, is jointly sponsored by the UN Agencies in Namibia. UNDESA operates as the Project's executing agency. The Ministry of Regional, Local Government and Housing (MRLGH) implements the Ohangwena component. WHO, UNFPA, UNICEF and UNAIDS support the health component along lines developed by the Ohangwena Regional Health Management Team; the communication and community mobilisation component is financed by UNESCO; UNDP is funding several of the components, including Co-ordination and administration, and is responsible for the Small- and Medium Sized Enterprises (SME) component. FAO supports the agricultural component. The project has been successful in fostering close co-operation between GRN, the Ohangwena Regional Council, and the UN Country Team. At the regional level, the implementation of the project has achieved considerable results: In 1999, the management and Co-ordination of this programme was handed over to the Regional Council to increase local ownership of the project. The agricultural component has achieved substantial results with respect to capacity building of staff within the extension services at the regional office and training of 500 farmers in the pilot communities. Two United Nations Volunteers (UNVs) attached to the agricultural component have supported the development of training programmes for both the communities and the government counterparts. The completion of an Activity Centre under the SME component. Effective collaboration in the social mobilisation efforts between the project staff and the officials of GRN institutions, such as the former Department of Women Affairs, Youth and Sports and the Directorate of Community Development19 UNESCO' technical and financial assistance for the operation of the Multi-Media Centre in Eenhana. In 1999, a mobile cinema van was provided for film viewing and production. The former Ministry of Information and Broadcasting20 to help to operate the centre seconded a media officer. Renovation of the studio was initiated in order to secure enough space for community-based programme production, and books were purchased and delivered to the community library. UNESCO also collaborated with UNDP and FAO on the elaboration of a research framework, and in the training of research assistants for a rapid rural appraisal in six pilot agricultural communities in the Region. Assistance was provided to local San communities in the production and marketing of their crafts, enabling them to 19 In March 2000, a Ministry of Women Affairs and Child Welfare, which includes the Directorate of Community Development (formerly with the Ministry of Regional and Local Government and Housing) has been established. At the same time, the Ministry of Youth and Sports has been integrated into the Ministry of Basic Education and Culture to form the new Ministry of Basic Education, Culture and Sport.20 In March 2000 the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has been incorporated into the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to form the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Information and BroadcastingUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 33 of 134participate for the first time in the Northern Namibia Trade Fair. UNESCO also supported the solar demonstration village at Onamunhama, where science teachers and Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) leaders were trained in the operation of the solar electricity system. Within the health component of the Programme, the WHO transferred funds to cover the expenses of the youth field officer who surveyed youth clubs and potential condom outlets in the region. WHO also supported the development of a regional health management plan. With the support of WHO and UNICEF, a Safe Motherhood Assessment resulted in the completion of 257 household surveys, and 16 focus group discussions were conducted with trained and untrained Traditional Birth Attendance (TBA) and traditional leaders. The national mosquito bed-net programme has been extended and the SME Coordinator has made arrangements to work within existing local structures (i.e. co-operatives) for the local production of bed-nets. UNICEF has supported the training of the Regional Health Management Team in the use of the Health Information System, while health workers from various districts received training in EPI/CDD and ARI. UNICEF has also provided funds for the more effective implementation of IMCI in the region, as well as for the polio vaccination programme. A comprehensive review of the project is pending and lessons learned will be documented for guidance in future area-based poverty reduction programmes in Namibia. f) The Bretton Woods Institutions' Response to Poverty Reduction UNDP and the World Bank worked in close co-operation in the preparation of the Namibian PRS, and the Bank has contributed US$50,000 to the GRN, matching the amounts provided for the National Capacity Assessment component of UNDP's Capacity Building for Economic Management Programme. An action plan is to be developed and funding sought. This will be an extensive undertaking, and prioritisation will be necessary. MIGA's Namibia-based \"Promote Africa\" programme collaborated in the implementation of the \"Africa-Asia Business Forum\" (October 1999), which brought together approximately 250 African and Asian business executives from targeted sectors and industries to further various mechanisms of collaboration (joint ventures, sub- contracting, franchising, distributorships) and investments, in that way contributing to the reduction of poverty in Namibia. 3. HIV/AIDS : A Threat to Growth, Poverty Reduction, Human Resources HIV/AIDS poses the single biggest threa t to all development efforts in Namibia. Consider ing that Namibia reported the first four AIDS cases in 1986 , and in view of the fact that today the country ranks amongst the seven most affected in the world , the spread of the disease seems phenomenal.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 34 of 134According to GRN sources, by June 2000, 72,995 Namibians (approximately 4% of the population) had tested positive with HIV since 1986, with the majority being between 15- 35 years. Given the fact that 29,021 Namibians had tested HIV+ by the end of 1996, this represents an increase of 151.5% between January 1997 and June 2000. According to GRN reports, the number of Namibians hospitalised as a result of HIV/AIDS grew to 21,607 by the end of 1999, representing an increase of 381% between 1997-1999. By the end of 1999, the number of Namibians who had died from AIDS grew to 8,679, representing an increase of 406% between 1997-1999. In 1998, women accounted for 53% of all reported new HIV cases, 17.4% of pregnant women attending antenatal clinics being monitored by the sentinel surveillance system tested HIV+, and the median age of HIV diagnosis was 30 years for women and 34 years for men. In 1999, AIDS accounted for 26% of all deaths in Namibia. UN estimates indicate that about 160,000 Namibian adults and children were living with HIV/AIDS by the end of 1999. The adult prevalence rate was estimated at 19.54%. An estimated 85,000 women aged 15-49 and an estimated 6,600 children under the age of 14 were living with HIV/AIDS by the end of 1999. The cumulative total of AIDS orphans was estimated to be 67,000 by the end of 1999. The estimated HIV prevalence rates for females aged 15-24 ranged from 18.78% to 20.82%, while for males aged 15-24, the estimated HIV prevalence rates ranged from 7.89% to 10.38%. This indicates that females are getting infected at a younger age than males and that older males are typically infecting younger females21. To illustrate the significance of the pandemic on the Namibian economy , a few rough estimat ions are listed below: the total cost of hospitali sation due to AIDS is expected to reach N$ 316.9 mi llion for the period 1996-2000, while the total outpatient costs fo r HIV infected people is expected to reach N$ 85.6 million fo r the same period (MoHSS's total budget for 2000/2001 is 1.279 billion22); between 1996 and 2000, the direct and indirect costs of AIDS in Namibia a re estimated to amount to approximately N$ 6 billion (revenue for the 2000/2001 financial year is estimated at N$ 7.7 billion23); one in five Namibians aged 15 - 49 is infected and likely to die within the next seven years, which presents serious problems for current and future development efforts; 21 Source: all HIV/AIDS related statistics are based on the UNFPA draft Third Country Programme, August 200022 Source: Estimate of Revenue and Expenditure for the Financial Year 1 April 2000 - 31 March 2001, Ministry of Finance23 dittoUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 35 of 134 life expectancy in Sub-Saharan Africa i ncreased from 44 years in the 1950s to 59 in the 1990s, though, UNAIDS estimates that li fe expectancy will decrease to 45 years between 2005 and 2010 Life Expectancy; in Namibia, AIDS has already caused life expectancy at birth to fall from 61.3 years in 1995 to 52.4 years by 2000; current UN estimates indicate an even lower life expectancy of 40.6 years for both males and females in Namibia , essentially wiping out almost 50 years of improvements24; and GDP could decline between 0.5% and 1.5% annually25. Apart from the suffering of individuals affected by HIV/AIDS and the emotional and financial strain on the ir families , the direct and indirect costs of the pandemic would render a ny attempt t o reduce poverty in Namibia futile i f the spread of the disease is not contained. a) The National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS: 1999 - 2004 The epidemic received more high-level attention in 1998, starting with the finalisation of the national strategic plan early in the year. In March, the President of Namibia launched the Plan, which covers the 1999-2004 period. The widely publicised launch of the National Strategic Plan has led to intensified collaboration among partners and brought on board new partnerships, such as the church community. Public acknowledgement and open discussion by political leaders, an increase in deaths due to HIV/AIDS related illness, coupled with the general increased awareness of the pandemic, has led to a reduction in the conspiracy of silence. The National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS 1999-2004 (Medium Term Plan II - MTPII) constitutes the framework that guides GRN and donors in their action against the spread of the disease. The overall aim of MTPII is to: mobilise all partners to reduce the number of HIV infections by strengthening support to HIV/AIDS prevention and control; support and strengthen national and regional programme management structures to ensure co-ordination and monitoring; ensure that all Namibians and their families living with HIV/AIDS have access to quality, affordable and responsive services to cater to their needs; 24 Source: Education and the Epidemic: The Effects of HIV/AIDS on Basic Education in Namibia, University of Texas, 200025 Source: UNAIDS Presentation on UNDP's Response to HIV/AIDS, Botswana, June 2000United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 36 of 134 ensure that all Namibians and their families living with HIV/AIDS are not subjected to any form of discrimination; and solicit and facilitate continuous support from national and international institutions to address all aspects of the impact of the epidemic The main strategies that will be implemented to achieve the objectives include: prevention of HIV/AIDS through the development and production of IEC materials and the dissemination of information; prevention of infection through advocating the use of condoms; provision of services such as safe and reliable blood testing, counselling, research, etc.; and provision of care and support to people affected by HIV/AIDS. Several national and regional programme management structures have been established. The National AIDS Committee is the highest policy-making body and comprises of Ministers. The National Multi-Sectoral AIDS Co-ordination Committee (NAMACOC), which is comprised of the thirteen Regional Governors, private sector representatives, church representatives, and the NGO community, is responsible for the co-ordination of primary prevention programmes. The National AIDS Executive Committee (NAEC) is charged with the implementation of decisions and monitoring of activities. The UN is represented on both NAMACOC and NAEC. The Permanent Secretary of the MOHSS has appointed technical Advisory Committees for specific areas. Regional AIDS Committees, chaired by the Governors, have been set up in several Regions and most Regions have produced action plans. At national level, all Ministries are required to budget, initiate and integrate activities aimed at addressing the pandemic and to identify a co-ordinator within a sector. The UN is the only partner donor organisation included formally in these structures, a reflection of the intensive support provided to the MOHSS by the UN System throughout the national strategic planning process, however, the MOHSS is also a part and parcel of TWG in decision making. b) The UN System's Response to the Threat of HIV/AIDS HIV/AIDS is a major joint priority for the UN Country Team (UNCT) in Namibia, and all of the resident Agencies are active members of the UN Theme Group on HIV/AIDS. The work of the Theme Group is organised around the National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS. The development of a joint UN work plan on HIV/AIDS began in late 1998, when priorities and strategies for joint action were defined. Since then, three Technical Working Groups (namely Communication, Education and Youth; Health Issues and Mitigation) have been working on specific issues, such as the creation of an enabling environment for positive behaviour change , positive living messages (HIV and nutrition), technical support on the prevention of mother to child transmission, support for childrenUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 37 of 134affected and orphaned by AIDS, family-based home care, and the strengthening of national and regional programme management capacities. Following a mission associated with the International Partnership Against HIV/AIDS, UNAIDS/Geneva has allocated considerable resources for Namibia's national response, complementing locally mobilised resources. Funds from UNAIDS/Geneva have been allocated to the National AIDS Executive Committee as it seeks to support the implementation of the national and regional strategic plans of action, as well as the NPCS in designing a relevant cross-cutting chapter on HIV/AIDS for NDP2. Given the scale of the national epidemic and its current and anticipated impact on all sectors of the economy, the UN Theme Group will ensure that HIV/AIDS variables are considered at sectoral and macro levels in this exercise. UNAIDS/Geneva has provided support to FAO for a national study on the impact of HIV/AIDS on the agricultural sector. The prominent role of the UN in advocacy around HIV/AIDS in 1999 has resulted in mobilising resources from the Swedish government amounting to US$ 450,000 to the Theme Group, mainly intended to support \"Expending Young People's Access to HIV/AIDS Prevention Services Including Condoms,\" through UNFPA, and communication activities related to the UNICEF life skills programme. A national multi-media task force involving eighteen organisations was created through the initiative of the Technical Working Group on Communication and Youth of the UN Theme Group on HIV/AIDS. UNICEF and UNESCO support to this initiative has been particularly important, with UNFPA and UNAIDS providing technical and financial resources. The Technical Working Group organised a workshop for local media managers on HIV/AIDS issues. UNESCO supported this with a series of lectures for manager and editors on the use of public broadcasting to help combat HIV/AIDS. The work of the Technical Working Group led to a renewed communication strategy around HIV/AIDS prevention and increased advocacy efforts, and confirmed the lead role of the UN System in forging consensus and initiating action in support of the national response. In addition to their participation in the Theme Group, several Agencies have substantial programmes focused on various aspects of prevention and care. They include: UNICEF assisted programmes, which have identified their existing and possible contribution to the GRN's national strategic plan on HIV/AIDS. In particular, My Future is My Choice , a life skills training for adolescents supported by UNICEF, remains the flagship HIV prevention programme in Namibia. This programme has reached more than 60,000 young people since its inception through peer education on sexuality, alcohol and drug abuse and risk reduction behaviour. Young people are also actively involved in the revision of the curriculum, in assessing youth friendliness of reproductive health services, and monitoring of the programme. Management of the programme is decentralised to the regions, and the national multi-media task force is creating an enabling environment for positive behaviour change.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 38 of 134 Major UNFPA and WHO activities in reproductive health, with the former focusing on adolescents, male involvement and population policy/education, and the latter providing technical and logistical support to the MoHSS in the areas of policy, supplies and training. A FAO case studies on the impact of HIV/AIDS on selected communities in the northern communal areas. FAO, UNFPA and UNESCO developed proposals during 1999 for additional HIV/AIDS funding in agriculture, population education and teacher training, respectively. The development of these proposals benefited significantly from Theme Group inputs throughout the process. UNDP's inclusion of HIV/AIDS as a permanent feature of its annual Namibian Human Development Reports. UNDP also provides operational support to the Theme Group Secretariat (office of the UNAIDS Country Programme Advisor). WHO's support to the development of guidelines and purchase of equipment for home-based care of AIDS patients. The Theme Group has also succeeded to mobilise resources from the Spanish government for a counselling project and support for regional co-ordination in the Erongo region. Containing t he spread of HIV/AIDS, as is the case with the reduction of poverty, can only be dealt with in a multi-sectoral approach in order to meet global targets . During the 1999 United Nations General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD+5), it was agreed that by 2005, at least 90% of young women and men aged 15-24 should have access to information, services and skills required to reduce their vulnerability to HIV infection, while HIV incidence in 15-24 year olds should be reduced by 25%. Under UNDAF, the co-sponsors on UNAIDS will assist GRN in assessing the effectiveness of the concerted effort to contain the spread of HIV/AIDS. c) The Bretton Woods Institutions' Response to the Threat of HIV/AIDS A World Bank mission on the incorporation of HIV/AIDS in national and sector level development planning was undertaken in the second half of 1999. The Bank has been developing \"toolkits\" to assist public policy-makers in the major public development sectors (particularly non-health related) to integrate AIDS prevention and mitigation efforts into sectoral planning, operations and evaluation efforts. These toolkits also support an intra-sectoral approach intended to enable public sector institutions to protect their own workforce from HIV and cope with the adverse consequences of AIDS in the workplace. The World Bank is discussing with GRN the development of a programme to assess the regional and sectoral incidents of HIV infection and its implication for human resources in the country.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 39 of 134d) Challenges Ahead Despite of the efforts made by the GRN, UN and other partners, there are challenges ahead in order to adequately respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Namibia. Among the major Challenges are the following: lack of voluntary testing and counselling facilities which would enable people to learn their HIV status and adopt safer behaviours; widespread stigma surrounding the epidemic and people living with HIV/AIDS; misconception about the role of confidentiality in the spread of the epidemic; need for Co-ordination of the national response and muti-sectoral mobilisation; need for capacity building at all levels to support implementation of the new strategic plan; and need to increase/mobilise national and external resources in support of sectoral and regional responses with the aim to intensify action against AIDS within the framework of the International Partnership Against AIDS in Africa (IPAA). F. The UNDAF Process The UNDAF for Namibia has been the result of a consultative process that involved GRN, civil society organisations, all Agencies of the UN System in Namibia and the donor community. The UNCT gathered for a retreat April 26-29th 2000, and held extensive discussions on the UNDAF process. UNDGO provided an advisor who briefed the workshop on the history of UNDAF, experiences gained and lessons learned, and on the objectives of UNDAF. UNCT decided to simplify the 1998 theme group and associated technical working group arrangement in favour of the following: two theme groups would be constituted in place of the original three; these would be POVERTY and HIV/AIDS. Dialogue within UNCT regarding both poverty and HIV/AIDS will be conducted within the respective Theme Groups, supported by seven technical working groups: health; gender and human rights; communication, youth and education; mitigation; food security; economic empowerment; basic education and communication; distributed as follows: THEME GROUPS TECHNICAL WORKING GROUPS POVERTY HEALTH, ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT, FOOD SECURITY, BASIC EDUCATION and COMMUNICATION, GENDER and HUMAN RIGHTS HIV/AIDS HEALTH, COMMUNICATION, YOUTH andUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 40 of 134 EDUCATION, MITIGATION, GENDER and HUMAN RIGHTS The reduction to two theme groups, down from the four established in 1998, reflected the need to conserve on scarce Agency Head's time. Both the health and gender and human rights technical working groups will serve both the poverty and HIV/AIDs theme groups, thus facilitating the cross cutting nature of the themes. These theme groups are chaired and co-chaired by Agency Heads with substantive responsibility and/or competence for the thematic areas and will be rotated on a calendar year basis. For the current year the poverty theme group will be chaired by UNDP and co-chaired by FAO; the HIV/AIDS theme group will be chaired by UNFPA and co-chaired by WHO. The technical working groups will report through the theme groups to the Heads of Agencies. Detailed terms of reference have been developed for all groups, theme and technical working. The above structure was agreed upon at an Agency Heads retreat of April 26-29th 2000 at which the following 1998 UN mission statement was readopted: 1. Mission Statement The UN System in Namibia exists to promote, support and monitor policy formulation, implementation and accountability in terms of international development norms and values, with particular reference to UN International Conferences, Conventions and Human Rights Standards. To this end, the UN System will use its limited programme resources for strategic and catalytic interventions to develop management capacity for sustainable human development in response to national priorities with particular focus on poverty, inequity, and HIV/AIDS reduction. The UN's view of development is people-centred with emphasis on poverty reduction and the elimination of inequalities. Accordingly, the role of the UN System in Namibia has been to advocate those policies and programmes that underscore the dignity of people and the equality of rights of men and women. The human rights based approach to development will be an important area of advocacy, involving decentralisation, participation of beneficiaries and an integrated approach to development. 2. The UNDAF Formulation Process A workplan for UNDAF was developed by the UNCT and involved the following stakeholders: 19 Ministries and other Agencies of GRN, major donors, one representative of minor donors, and civil society organisations. A steering committee, co-chaired by the Permanent Secretary of the NPCS and the UN Resident Coordinator a.i., and comprising representatives of the above-mentioned stakeholder groupings, was instituted to guide the process. Three multi-disciplinary working groups were formed to provide comprehensive information on the following topics:United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 41 of 134 Poverty, Inequality Reduction, and Economic Growth; HIV/AIDS; and Governance, Human Rights and Gender. The working groups met twice independently and once jointly in order to deliberate the various mandates and activities of individual stakeholders, to identify opportunities for supplementary interventions and to assist in the administration of a coherent strategy to enhance the role of the UN System in Namibia26. In addition, a consultant and a team of UNDP officials had been tasked to interview representatives of a select group of donors and GRN officials to establish their probable near- to medium-term intentions, their perceptions of the appropriate role for the UN System, and to explore opportunities for collaboration and complementarity. In addition, extensive discussions were held with Heads of UN Agencies to clarify the mandates of the individual UN Programmes, Funds and Specialised Agencies, deliberate their respective comparative advantages, identify their approach to development co-operation in the near future, and explore opportunities that will enhance the impact of their individual and collaborative programmes. Although NDP2 and VISION 2030 will not be available until April 2001 and mid-2001, respectively, at the earliest, indications are that NDP2 will carry forward the NDP1 objectives: reviving and sustaining economic growth; reducing inequality in income distribution; creating employment; and reducing poverty. Three additional objectives have been added: gender equality and equity; reducing regional development inequalities; and good governance. In addition, objective one is now modified to read: sustainable economic growth and development. 26 Minutes of meetings are attached as Annex 5.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 42 of 134Regarding Vision 2030, the process has only just begun, but it will be bottom-up, participative, and will cover the entire country, and will take place over a twelve-month period. The vision of a developed country by 2030 will drive the exercise. The Prime Minister is the patron of the exercise. Future five-year plans will be guided by this thirty year long-term perspective vision. Despite the extreme duality of Namibia's socio-economic structure alluded to earlier, aid flows will, in the immediate future, unless something is done to arrest the situation, be governed by the middle income status based on the high US$2,000 per capita arithmetic average per capita GDP. However, a Gini coefficient of 0.7 (1996), one of the highest in the world, and median income of some US$150 per annum, Namibia should be regarded as an LDC, with strong support for infrastructural and human resource development on a grant basis for some time to come. The UNCT will press for the continuation of this status. Against this is the fact that several major Donors have signalled their intention to discontinue direct development co-operation with Namibia in the near future, among them Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. 3. Prospective Interventions Identified During the UNDAF Process In the course of the deliberations of the working groups and during the interviews with stakeholders, proposals were made on a number of possible interventions, additional to the current activities of UN Agencies, that could enhance the role of the UN System and would be of valuable assistance to GRN27. The following opportunities, listed below in no particular order, emerged for UNCT to reflect on: UNDP assisting in the formalisation of a GRN-NGO relationship; assisting GRN in addressing the issue of globalisation (e.g. cross-cutting chapter for NDP2) and an infrastructural scenario for Vision 2030; compiling and sharing information on donor and global facilities; assisting GRN in developing a sector-wide approach to development co-operation and in encouraging donors to channel financial assistance through the State Revenue Fund, if and when possible; encouraging compliance by UN Agencies and donors with GRN's related policies intended to further good governance, in particular decentralisation, commercialisation and civil service reform; encouraging the use of public expenditure reviews to establish the extent to which expenditure allocations have contributed to their intended outcomes; assisting the NPCS in establishing a forum for aid Co-ordination and in the formulation of policies and guidelines on development co-operation; assisting NPCS in introducing regular sector consultations and strategic dialogues with donors; assisting GRN in having the relevant data collected that would be required for a review of its status as middle-income country; 27 For an elaboration on lessons learned, refer to Annex 3.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 43 of 134 assisting UNCT to put forward for consideration by the Executive Board arguments in support of the continuation of the \"as if LDC\" status for Namibia; assisting in the production of socio-economic data that is adjusted to be consistent with Namibia's development framework; introducing capability deprivation elements in human development indices in order to encourage a change in the regional predisposition of interventions; supporting the UN System in Namibia, in close co-operation with all stakeholders, to define and reach agreement on, concepts such as poverty, poverty reduction, a human rights approach to programming and good governance; assisting in the establishment of a Technical Working Group on the environment; sharing information on good practices and lessons learned widely; assisting the UN System, in co-operation with Namibian stakeholders, in the improvement of the participatory approach to the identification of areas of co- operation, the planning of interventions and the review of programmes; and assisting in the establishment of technical working groups on the environment and on capacity building. UNFPA assisting the NPCS in the possible commercialising or outsourcing of its data collection function; and assisting in the production of population and related data that is adjusted to be consistent with Namibia's development framework. UNICEF strengthening GRN's social service management at field level; utilising existing, or assisting in the establishment of new, umbrella institutions, to strengthen the planning and implementation capacity of communities in, amongst others, preparation for the European Union (EU) policy of closer involvement of non-state actors in aid delivery; assisting to address issues raised in the 1999 Human Development Report relating to alcohol abuse by focusing demand reduction efforts on prevention programmes for the youth28; and co-operating with EU on the implementation of the Micro Project Scheme29. FAO advocacy on, and assistance for, the possible establishment of a responsible GRN organisation for rural development; promoting a scientific approach to the land issue; focusing on the destabilising effects of the migrant and casual labour systems of the fisheries sector; and advocating the augmentation of agricultural production using different techniques.

Goals and Objectives In line with the stated objectives of UNDAF, key stakeholders agreed on the following framework for the UN System in Namibia that will guide the strengthening of the individual Agencies in preparation for the role they will play during the implementation NDP2 and Vision 2030. It has been stated that it is the intention of UNDAF to provide renewed impetus to the role of development operations by advancing the core missions of the UN System and promoting the visions and principles of the United Nations Charter. To this end, it aims for greater impact of the UN System co-operation on the development and well being of people through: improved focus and results orientation, identifying where the UN System can make the most difference using its unique strengths as a development partner; stronger unity of purpose and team spirit within the UN System; increased collaboration through a mix of agency, parallel and joint programming; better integration of the normative and operational aspects of development co- operation; increased dialogue and stronger partnerships and alliances with other members of the development community such as national and global civil society, the private sector, bilateral donors, the World Bank and other international financial institutions, and the European Commission; more efficient use of limited resources, based on improved division of labour, rationalisation of resource allocation and streamlined procedures; and improved opportunities for securing increased resources in support of national needs and priorities30. Initially, UNDAF for Namibia, in a country specific approach to development planning, will concentrate on the strategic positioning of the UN System in anticipation of the completion of NDP2 (March 2001) and Vision 2030 (during 2001). It will guide UN Agencies to build on their common and individual comparative advantages in order to enhance their capacity to make a more than ever consequential impact on the reduction of poverty, including the containment of the spread of HIV/AIDS, by utilising a human rights approach to programming. 30 UNDAF Guidelines, United Nations, April 1999United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 46 of 134Once NDP2 and Vision 2030 have become operational, the UN Agencies will, during subsequent stages of UNDAF, review or develop agency, parallel or joint programmes within the guidelines of Namibia's short-term plan and long-term vision. Programme revision and planning will take due account of cross-cutting concerns related to the environment, gender issues, human rights and the rights of children. A. Improved Focus and Unity of Purpose UNDAF is based on the perception that the Namibian situation warrants a country specific approach to address the above-mentioned development objectives. In this regard, agreement has been reached to concentrate the efforts of all UN Agencies on the most important priority area identified in the Namibian development context. As its medium- to long-term developmental focus, UNDAF, in the Namibian context, will converge on a combined effort to reduce poverty, employing a human rights approach. Because of the pandemic's far-reaching impact on all poverty reduction efforts, UN Agencies will simultaneously continue to assist in containing the immediate crisis situation posed by HIV/AIDS. It should be noted that, while the focus of all UN actions will be on poverty reduction and the containment of the spread of HIV/AIDS, all actions of the UN System, within the mandates of its respective Agencies, will remain authoritative contributions intended to enhance the sustainability of the more direct poverty reduction interventions that will be initiated by GRN, NGOs and external funding agencies. In this regard, of special mention are those contributions directed at the promotion of gender equality, human rights and the rights of children, democracy, good governance, transparency and accountability, compliance with international standards, equalities, environmental sustainability, community empowerment and GRN-civil society partnerships. B. The United Nation's Unique Strength to make a Difference The unique strength of the United Nations is based on its global mandates and comparative advantages to bring about peace and development. Its comparative advantage lies in its political neutrality, access to world opinion through ECOSOC, the knowledge, information and expertise available through its specialised agencies, its grants-based technical assistance through UNDP and its mandate as the world agenda setting and facilitating institution31. The combined mandates of the UN Country Team (UNCT) provide the most authoritative mechanism that can be employed to make a meaningful contribution to the development of Namibia. In order to be able to take full advantage of this unique instrument, mandates need to be interpreted within a country specific framework. As such, they need to be discussed and understood by all stakeholders, and they need to be employed to their 31 An outline of the mandates of the various UN Funds, Programmes and Specialised Agencies is attached as Annex 1.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 47 of 134fullest extent in support of the social, political and economic objectives of the country. In joining the UN, member states accept to carry out the obligations as provided for in the numerous Conventions and Declarations. Very importantly, the UN System is not biased by political considerations and is therefore in a position to advance the globally declared principles of the UN Charter. The UN System in Namibia enjoys the following unique comparative advantages: Namibia's Independence has been achieved as a result of the direct intervention of the UN; as such, and due to the UN's assistance to the people of Namibia prior to Independence, the UN has a distinctive relationship with GRN, its people and its politicians; the UN is impartial with the agenda to implement the UN Charter; through its programmes, the UN is well connected to GRN institutions; the UN's mandate is backed by global consensus; the UN System has a global network and depository of specialised expertise, information and experience; unlike donors, GRN can count on the permanence of the UN's presence; the UN is highly regarded for its capacity to set norms and standards and for its readiness and ability to assist countries in complying with these values; the UN's capability to raise funds from sources that would otherwise not be accessible to the GRN; its capacity to engage in advocacy that has assisted GRN to face reality and to confront issues; its status of convener of stakeholders on a variety of issues; its reputation as an impartial co-ordinator; and its role as peacemaker. As such the UNCT is highly valued by the GRN and is looked to for leadership in the development and human rights areas. The comparative advantages are supported by the fact that the UN, its mandates and its Agencies are the consequence of a global consensus on its existence, endorsed, operated and financed by Namibia and all its international development partners.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 48 of 134In order for the UN System to make a difference to the development process of Namibia, UN Agencies will internalise and publicise the general and the specific mandates and comparative advantages, adapt them to the needs of the country, engage only in those activities where mandates and advantages can be taken full advantage of, and above all, demonstrate to the Namibian Government that the stated comparative advantages hold true. C. Efficient Use of Resources The resources base for UN interventions in Namibia is gradually decreasing. According to the NPCS, in 1990, the UN System contributed US$ 12.5 million (or 20% of total assistance), while by 1998 they contributed US$ 9.3 million (or 5.1% of total external resources)32. The limited financial and human resource base necessitates the refocusing of interventions in order to continue to make an impact. In view of the UN mandates and its comparative advantages, a meaningful impact on the development of Namibia can be made if interventions are concentrated at the highest institutional level possible. Intervention at this level is appropriate in view of the UN's mandates and comparative advantages. In line with UNDAF, future interventions of the UN System will focus those activities related to human, institutional and community capacity building programmes, on the establishment of systems for social service delivery, with due regard to the country specific circumstances, the UN System's mandates and its comparative advantages, and in line with the agreed goal to contribute to the reduction of poverty and the prevalence and social cost of HIV/AIDS. Interventions will be cost-effective, participatory, replicable and sustainable, making full use of existing representative institutions at national, regional, local and community level. In addition, although a multitude of policies are in place that await implementation, the UN System will assist in ascertaining whether these policies, their strategies and action plans, are sufficient in scope and scale to have the intended impact. Importantly, capacity building for policy implementation, monitoring and review will be targeted. D. Increased Collaboration and Dialogue The concentration of UN Agency efforts on cross-cutting and multi-sectoral concerns such as the reduction of poverty and the containment of the spread of HIV/AIDS, within a human rights approach and at the highest possible institutional level, will provide an enabling environment for increased co-operation and dialogue between UN Agencies, Ministries, regional structures, communities and international development partners. It is at this level of intervention that the UN Agencies can be most effective and where 32 Source: draft NDP2 Chapter on Development Co-operationUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 49 of 134development co-operation partners converge to discuss policies, strategies and action plans. Under UNDAF, the UN System will make an increased effort to seek opportunities for, and contribute to, the process of collaboration and dialogue by bringing the full scope of the UN financial and human resources to bear at the country level. In this regard, the central role of the NPC and its Secretariat, acting as co-ordinators for sectoral, regional and thematic programmes and interventions through the planning process, are recognised as the focal point for all policy issues and matters related to external assistance. This is an important point and implies that the UN will work as a team with NPCS on policy, Co- ordination and review issues, while the technical specialised UN Agencies work directly with the implementing Ministries and agencies which are required to provide feedback to NPCS regarding implementation and performance. E. The Outcome of UNDAF When the above-mentioned objectives of improved focus, collaboration, dialogue and utilisation of scarce resources, combined with refined mandates and increased application of comparative advantages, are translated into action, the following assistance framework for the development co-operation of the UN System in Namibia will emerge: Taking full advantage of its comparative advantages, interventions at the highest possible level are performed within the framework of the UN System's mandates and comparative advantages, within the structures of Namibia's medium- and long- term development plans and visions and in accordance with its institutional arrangements. The interventions will have a consequential, focused, unique, co- ordinated, gender-responsive and sustainable impact on the reduction of poverty through decreased inequalities, increased access to public goods and services and enhanced community institutional and human capabilities. In addition, concerted efforts will be made to contain the spread of HIV/AIDS in Namibia and provide care and support to those infected and affected.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 50 of 134IV. Co-operation Strategies A. Strengthen the Role of the UN System The following co-operation strategies will be considered under UNDAF to strengthen the overall role of the UN System in Namibia considering its unique mandates, its special relationship with GRN, its comparative advantages and its limited financial resource base, the UN System will not be considered by GRN as a \"multilateral donor\" but rather as a high-level development partner that renders its services on a grant basis; in this regard the UN assistance will be targeted at the policy and programme levels and, where appropriate, at project assistance with a view to (a) create awareness and/or pilot results to be a basis for lessons learned and replication and (b) support capacity building with a view to sustainability when the project assistance ceases; in this regard should resources permit interventions at project level, these will be considered jointly (UN Agencies, GRN and the affected community), to put policy measures to the test or to bring about strategic interventions, only after the fundamentals of replicability have been adequately addressed; and when considering interventions, existing and related GRN policies furthering good governance and the enhancement of human rights will be supported, in particular decentralisation, commercialisation, civil service reform and employment creation and training. B. Prospective Donor Assistance Interviews conducted with a select group of major multilateral and bilateral donors in Namibia, led to the conclusion that development co-operation has undergone and is undergoing major changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, as summarised below: several major donors will be restricting their areas of co-operation from the currently supported wide spectrum of sectoral interventions to a few focal areas (EU and Germany in particular); although no major donor has discontinued assistance to Namibia at this stage, new long-term commitments are the exception (EU) rather than the rule, and assistance will eventually be phased out (Sweden, Finland); the type of assistance rendered has, in qualitative terms, changed from direct budgetary assistance (Nordic countries, EU, Netherlands), to sectoralUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 51 of 134(Netherlands) and inter-sectoral programme support (Netherlands), and will eventually develop into a sector-wide approach to development co-operation (Sweden); and Namibia's status as middle-income country is increasingly being taken seriously (Germany, Finland). In this regard several donors feel that, as a middle-income country, more could be done by Namibia with regard to poverty reduction. The information indicated above was assembled by way of interviews of a select group of major donors so as to inform the UN System regarding opportunities likely to arise from current and planned donor activities having a bearing on the prospective policy dialogue, capacity building, direct programme co-operation and resource mobilisation. The donor agencies that have been interviewed were selected, in co-operation with the Directorate for Development Co-operation of the NPCS and as indicated in the UNDAF workplan, on the basis of the scope and scale of their development assistance and on the nature of their objectives for future co-operation33. C. Aid Co-ordination Within the UNDAF framework, the UN System will assist GRN to enhance its bargaining position with donors; focus the attention of donors to national priority areas and national execution modalities; promote the notion of a programme approach and sector-based assistance in favour of the current project-based approach to development co-operation; facilitate the dialogue between GRN and other donors to ensure sustainability of programmes/projects; and support GRN in its efforts to sustain activities implemented by donors using the comparative advantages of all UN Agencies concerned. Government plays an important role in enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the UN Agencies in Namibia as a partner in the development process. Given the unique role of the UN System and its comparative advantages, the NPCS, through its donor co-ordination role, will ensure the inclusion of relevant UN Agencies, whenever possible and feasible, as observers or advisers during bilateral negotiations on policy matters; 33 Details on the different co-operation programmes are attached as Annex 2.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 52 of 134 promote the inclusion of relevant UN Agencies as implementing agencies in certain high-level areas of competence; support the UNDP in its donor co-ordinating role, thus further harmonising and enhancing the quality of assistance and the quantity of expected aid flows; and incorporate the principles of UNDAF and the role of UN Agencies in the relevant chapter(s) of NDP2 and Vision 2030.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 53 of 134V. Follow-up and Review A. Immediate Steps to Institutionalise UNDAF In order to operationalise UNDAF, it is important to bring about the following: the non-resident UN Agencies will be sent copies of the agreed UNDAF document forthwith for their information and inputs; the UNDAF document will be submitted to the Namibian Cabinet for endorsement. Following this, the UNDAF as the framework for UN assistance to the development process, will be incorporated into NDP2, and chapters which make reference to UN Agencies and their activities will be scrutinised and revised in line with UNDAF; in order to identify opportunities in addition to those listed in Chapter VI, and to engender support for, and understanding of, UNDAF, the UN Resident Co- ordinator will lead the UNCT in detailed briefing of civil society, bilateral donors, the EU, the NPCS and Ministries on the operational steps following the adoption of UNDAF by Cabinet and the UN Executive Board; UN Agencies will review their mandates along the lines of UNDAF, formulate a country specific approach, appraise their planned interventions on the basis of a common understanding reached under UNDAF on concepts such as poverty, poverty reduction, human rights approach, governance, etc.; develop monitoring indicators and system for monitoring and updating; update CCA data to enable the UN System to set targets, monitor progress and evaluate outcomes; and an UNDAF support structure will be considered within the UN System, and between stakeholders, in order to ensure continuity and institutional memory. Regular joint meetings between thematic working groups on UNDAF related principles would greatly enhance the effect of UNDAF. B. Follow-up The first important milestone in the realisation of UNDAF will be the development of detailed Country Programmes by individual UN Agencies in support of the priorities, policies, strategies, objectives, programmes and projects as stated in NDP2, expected end of first quarter 2001. As elaborated above, NDP2 will form the basis for development initiatives 2000/2001 through 2005/2006. The early and active involvement of the UN System in the NDP2 plan formulation process will greatly facilitate the task ofUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 54 of 134identifying opportunities for future interventions under UNDAF as a common frame of reference. Once opportunities for development co-operation have been identified, the UNCT will develop, in close co-operation with the Namibian and international partners, their Agency specific programmes, and enter, whenever possible, into collaborative, parallel or joint programmes34 in the areas of poverty and inequality reduction, assistance to HIV prevention and AIDS assistance and mitigation. In this connection, a national programme for HIV/AIDS already exists, with clearly identified roles for UNCT. Individual agency programmes will, therefore, be elaborated to reflect their respective roles and complementarities. An important aspect of this phase of UNDAF development will be the elaboration of impact indicators to permit programme monitoring. The second landmark for UNDAF will be the finalisation of Vision 2030, expected last quarter 2001. The various scenarios that will be developed might require urgent and far- reaching adjustments to the strategies and action plans that are outlined in NDP2. Again, the UN System's close association with the drafting process of Vision 2030 could make it possible to render meaningful assistance, utilising its mandates and comparative advantages. Beyond the country programming, a third occasion for the UN System to make an impact on developments in Namibia will be presented by its close involvement in the mid-term review of NDP2. The results of this review will provide an important basis for the appraisal of UNDAF. At this stage, UNDAF will need to be adjusted to guide the UN System's activities in accordance with possibly changed circumstances. The indicators that will be used to ascertain progress made towards achieving the objectives of UNDAF will correspond with the indicators that will be proposed within the framework of NDP2. UNDAF will furthermore be adjusted in accordance with, and monitored by, the Mid- Term Reviews (MTR) of Country Programmes. C. Review Indicators more specific to the evaluation of the institutional aspects addressed by UNDAF will include aspects such as: relevance of, and value added by, interventions to poverty reduction; number of collaborative, parallel or joint programmes; 34 UNDG defines parallel programming as a process through which two or more UN entities design separate programmes, but these contribute to the achievement of a common objective that has been identified through a collaborative assessment process, within a concerted timeframe. Joint programming takes place when UN entities jointly carry out assessments of problems and design interventions consisting of shared objectives, actions, timeframes, resource requirements and clear delineation of responsibilities. Source: UNDAF Guidelines, United Nations, April 1999.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 55 of 134 extent to which programming, programme cycles and reviews have been harmonised, and the effect this had on programme impact; visibility of the UN System in Namibia; changes in the general perception of the UN, its mandates and its comparative advantages; incidents of high-level involvement in policy dialogue with GRN, civil society and external funding agencies; incidents of UN System co-operation; and qualitative and quantitative changes in external resources flows. Upon the completion of the UNDAF cycle, the results will be reviewed in parallel with the evaluation of NDP2. The key implementers of the UNDAF principles will be the UN Resident Co-ordinator and the UN Country Team. The UN Resident Co-ordinator will play a vital role in facilitating UNDAF in the interest of Namibia's development and a more effective UN delivery of services. D. United Nations Mechanisms Throughout the programming period, the Theme Groups and their respective Technical Working Groups will continue the task of monitoring and assessing the situation and providing inputs to the UNCT. UN Agencies will make an effort to increasingly utilise a system of indicators and external evaluation when assessing the impact of its interventions so as to avoid the perpetuation and continuation of activities that are not directly linked to its respective mandates, comparative advantages, resource bases, or the guiding principles of UNDAF.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 56 of 134VI. Programme Resources Framework As regards resources, the UN System in Namibia is in a transition. The current Country Programme for the UNDP started in 1997 and will end in 2000; UNICEF 1997 to 2001; UNFPA 1997 to 2000; WHO 2000 to 2001; FAO, UNHCR and UNESCO have open- ended programme cycles. On the side of GRN, the new planning cycle begins in 2001 when NDP2 is expected to become operational. Later during 2001, Vision 2030 will be available. At this juncture, therefore, only a prospective programme view can be presented as outlined below: A. The Resources of the United Nations System under UNDAF 1. UNDP With the general aim of \"promoting human rights through development\", UNDP will endeavour to achieve the overall objectives of poverty reduction and sustainable human development (SHD) in Namibia through a strategic targeting of its resources towards specified areas and levels of intervention, in partnership with the GRN, the organised civil society and the private sector. a) Developmental objective UNDP to act as a pro-active facilitator, advocate and adviser to the halving of poverty by 2015. b) Strategic objectives \u00a7 assist GRN to improve its policy implementation and co-ordination capacity; \u00a7 strengthen the capacity of GRN to enable civil society at large to participate more effectively in the development process; and \u00a7 strengthen the GRN's capacity for aid co-ordination with a view to mobilising resources. c) Areas of intervention \u00a7 Advocacy and capacity-strengthening for the institutions that support the realisation and enlargement of human rights (legislature, judiciary, central, regional and local authorities). \u00a7 Economic management, specifically in the areas of institutional capacity building, restructuring of the macro-economic framework to take on a more pro-United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 57 of 134poor anti-poverty stance, developing pro-poor sectoral and meso-policies, aid co- ordination and sectoral policy co-ordination. \u00a7 Public administration, specifically in supporting the process of decentralisation, making the public service more effective through promotion of public service ethics, rationalisation of the civil service and accountability of public enterprises. \u00a7 Employment creation, income generation and natural resource management . \u00a7 Assistance to HIV-AIDS interventions , particularly in terms of advocacy, awareness creation, aid co-ordination and mitigation. d) Levels of intervention In view of UNDP's comparative advantage and its history in the country, the most strategic levels of intervention are those of 'advocacy' and 'policy advice' . However, for specific focus areas, capacity building will be an important component at the level of 'programme support' . Selected pilot projects in the field will also contribute to demonstrate innovative, sustainable and replicable approaches to poverty reduction and SHD.35 As for the support to GRN in achieving sustainable human development, three strategic objectives emerge: assist GRN to strengthen the policy implementation and Co-ordination capacity; strengthen the capacity of GRN to enable civil society at large to participate more effectively in the development process; and strengthen the GRN's capacity for aid Co-ordination with a view to mobilising resources. Assist GRN to restructure its expenditure profile to take on a more strident pro-poor, anti-poverty approach. Funding for Indicative Programme It is too early to provide a good estimate of core programming costs, but the level of resources at US$ 3.4 million available over the 1997 through 2000 cycle is being entertained. The above considerations will be the basis for the next UNDP-GRN country co-operation framework. 35 For more details about the specific sector of UNDP's intervention and their linkages to the role of the other UN agencies, refer to the tables under Chapter VI, Section B.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 58 of 1342. UNFPA On the basis of the recommendations of the Second Country Programme Evaluation and the UNDAF, the Third Country Programme will address three major problems. These are: the rapid rise in Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI)/HIV/AIDS among adolescents and youth, affecting females in particular, with the attendant effect on morbidity and mortality; maternal mortality associated with teenage pregnancies; and the high rate of gender-based violence and sexual abuse. The goal of the Third Country Programme will be to contribute to the reduction of HIV/AIDS incidence among 15-24 year old Namibians in line with the ICPD+5 target; the reduction of maternal mortality among female adolescents and youth; and the reduction of gender-based violence and sexual abuse among adolescents and youth. Two sub-programmes, Reproductive Health (RH), including Family Planning and Sexual Health, and Population and Development Strategies (PDS) will be developed to contribute to the achievement of this goal with advocacy for gender concerns built into both sub-programmes. The purpose of the RH sub-programme at national level will be to contribute to a reduction in the behaviour placing individual adolescents and youth at risk of STI/HIV/AIDS infections and teenage pregnancies. In selected Regions, the purpose will be to contribute to attitudinal and behavioural change in relation to STI/HIV/AIDS and teenage pregnancy, including acceptance by young males of female reproductive rights, and the male responsibility for achieving these. The purpose of the PDS sub-programme will be to contribute to the prioritisation of HIV/AIDS prevention interventions among adolescents and youth at Regional level, in the context of decentralisation and the National Plan of Action for Population Policy Implementation. The strategies that will be adopted to contribute to the achievement of the goal and purposes include communication for behaviour change; technical and managerial capacity building; advocacy; social mobilisation and community empowerment; socio- cultural and operational research; and the provision of services, equipment and supplies. These strategies will be operationalised through component project activities involving strategic training; strengthening of management skills; procurement of RH commodities;United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 59 of 134advocacy and IEC message and material development, production and diffusion; and integrated socio-cultural and operational research. The implementation of the component projects will lead to the development of personal motivation for behavioural change among adolescents and youth based on increased knowledge and attitudinal changes, access to RH services and commodities and more control over decision making by females. This will also provide the context for developing achievable outputs for which the sub- programmes are accountable. These outputs will result in attitudinal and behavioural changes in relation to the utilisation of RH services and related benefits in terms of gender roles and responsibilities; increases in terms of financial and geographical accessibility of RH services and commodities; increases in terms of technical capacity to make available RH services and commodities; and legal and cultural acceptability, through normative change, of RH services and commodities. The RH sub-programme will have four outputs: (1) at national level, accessibility of condoms by all sexually active adolescents and youth; (2) at national level, creation of a supportive policy and legal environment for the provision of Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) information and services to adolescents and youth; (3) in selected Regions, creation of political support at community level for the provision of SRH information and services to adolescents and youth; and (4) in selected Regions, provision of adolescent- and youth-friendly SRH information and services. The PDS sub-programme will have one output: (1) increased exposure of policy makers to SRH issues among adolescents and youth in Regions most vulnerable to HIV/AIDS infection. The achievement of these outputs will lead to changes in behaviour that place individual adolescents and youth at risk of SRH-related morbidity and mortality, and will also lead to changes in the socio-cultural norms and practices that perpetuate gender inequality and inequity. In this way, the achievement of the outputs will contribute to the achievement of the purposes of the sub-programmes in terms of reducing the risky behaviour and vulnerability of adolescents and youth in relation to SRH issues and to promoting greater gender equality and equity. This, in turn, will also contribute to the achievement of the goal of the Country Programme. Funding for Indicative Programme The Third Country Programme will require US$3.5 million from regular resources and US$9 million from multi-bilateral and/or other resources, including regular resources. The regular resources will be distributed between the RH sub-programme (US$2.7 million), the PDS sub-programme (US$0.5 million) and Programme Co-ordination and Assistance (US$0.3 million). Given the limited level of regular resources available for a Category B country like Namibia, efforts will be made to mobilise US$8.5 million for theUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 60 of 134RH sub-programme and US$0.5 million for the PDS sub-programme from multi-bilateral resources. 3. UNICEF Based on the documented successes and failures, and considering UNICEF mandate, the situation of children in Namibia and national priorities, UNICEF Namibia will remain involved in the following areas of assistance, using a human rights approach to programming: Young children's health, care and development. Parents are the primary duty bearers for the fulfillment of young children's rights. Programmes need to strengthen the capacity i.e. knowledge and skills of parents to ensure their children stay health, and to ensure the right conditions for psychosocial development. Health services, ECD services, and civil society groups and systems need to be re-oriented to directly support families and communities to improve parenting practices. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection, and need to stay healthy to remain in charge of their own development. UNICEF will continue to be involved in supporting programmes for young people, with young people. Vulnerable groups will remain the focus of UNICEF's intervention. These include the development of protection services or policies, and to ensure that marginalised groups are not excluded from services. To achieve a reduction in the persistent disparities, a voice shall be given to particularly marginalised groups, and UNICEF may help to develop affirmative action strategies to ensure full participation of those groups in societal decision-making. All proposed areas of involvement call for community based solutions and require decentralised management structures. UNICEF will furthermore continue to advocate for child friendly policies and strategies, and protection of particularly vulnerable groups. Funding for Indicative Programme Data does not currently exist for the indicative programme for the years 2002 - 2005. Past funding levels are therefore being used as an indicator of future funding needs. Regular funding stood at US$ 4.44 million for the cycle 1997 to 2001, with US$ 3.29 million for the support budget, bringing the total UNICEF budget to US$ 6.726. In addition, funding from other sources totalled some US$ 8.77 million. This brings the total resources through UNICEF to US$ 16 million, broken down as follows: UNICEF Regular Resources US$ 4.44 million UNICEF Support Budget US$ 3.29 millionUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 61 of 134Other resources through UNICEF US$ 8.77 million Total US$ 16.00 million 4. FAO The Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Rural Development (MAWRD) has laid a firm foundation for the long-term development of the sub sector. Four areas have been identified as crucial for FAO and other UN Agencies support in the next 5 - 10 years: human resources development in the form of continued support to the Faculty of Agriculture and Natural Resources of UNAM for the production of diploma and degree graduates as well as masters and doctoral degrees in the next 5 - 10 years; upgrade the skills of senior personnel at the level of Deputy Directors and junior Senior Researchers of the MAWRD through provision of masters and doctoral training opportunities; supporting Food Security Programmes including diversification enterprises to enable communal farmers to generate adequate income to be self-reliant on food; small scale irrigation activities using some of the waters of the Oshanas as well as perennial rivers to enable the farmers to improve their livelihoods; the findings of the Ministry's experimentation with dates, grapes cotton are encouraging in the area of diversification; supporting Policy Formulation and Planning initiatives and provide technical assistance in the form of training to master and doctoral level in policy and project formulation, appraisal, monitoring and evaluation; and assisting GRN in the preparation of a comprehensive policy on rural development together with workable programmes as well as the development of an agro- industrial policy. The Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources (MFMR) is one of the GRN units that have a well-established training programme. Despite the training efforts, the Ministry has identified four areas for FAO support: assisting policy and management of the marine resources in the next 5 - 10 years; supporting marine fisheries environment research or oceanography; assisting in the establishment of fresh water fisheries programme; and assisting in the development of aquaculture aimed to use swamps, flood plains and large dams for the establishment of a commercial fresh water industry.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 62 of 134The Directorate of Forestry has identified three critical areas for FAO support and collaboration. encouraging the domestication of wild fruit trees; assisting global forestry initiatives for climate change under the Global Environment Facility Programme (GEF); and assisting the management of natural forests by way of establishing the expertise needed for long-term monitoring and research perspective. The Ministry of Lands Resettlement and Rehabilitation (MLRR) requires FAO's support in training in the areas of land use planning, land surveying and land valuation. Funding for Indicative Programme The value of assistance needed from donors, GRN and other sources is tentatively put at N$ 46,757,753 or some US$ 6.7 million at current 7:1 exchange rate to the US$. 5. WHO Under UNDAF, and within the framework of a revised corporate structure that will include poverty reduction as a focal area of co-operation, WHO will continue to address issues related to health sector reform and district health systems, capacity building, disease prevention and control with specific emphasis on HIV/AIDS and malaria, strengthened epidemiological work, reproductive health, and health and the environment. WHO will, under the following objectives provide direct assistance to the Ministry of Health and Social Services: Support the MOH in strengthening integrated disease surveillence in order to improve immediate notification of diseases and appropriate action Strengthen national capacity for disease prevention and control with emphasis on STIs/HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis, and childhood diseases Support the efforts towards elimination and eradication of EPI priority target diseases namely: neonatal tetanus (NNT), measles and poliomyelitis. Strengthen national capacity for prevention and control of non-communicable diseases Contribute to the decentralization of health services initiated in 1998 and the strenthening of planning and management functions of the health system Assist the MOH in the establishment of adolescent friendly health services Assist the MOH in implementation of the policy and strategy for reproductive health Strengthen the WHO Country Office to provide consistent support to the Government for the restructure and decentralization of the health sectorUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 63 of 134 Assist the MOH in the review of the national plan for food and nutrition to identify areas in need of intensified support Assist the MOH to complete the formulation and implementation of the health sector policy and strategy dvelopment on health and the environment Support the establishment of a Co-ordination strategy and network for national response to emergencies Support the MOH to implement the National Policy in order to improve the provision essential drugs throughout the health system Strengthen information dissemination and partnerships in Government line Ministries and with stakeholders in health Funding for Indicative Programme WHO has a two-year programming cycle and is currently in the middle of the 2000 through to 2001 cycle. Total resources (US$ 2.003 million) are allocated as follows: Reproductive health and research CCC US$ 192,000 Nutrition for health and development DDB 20,000 Protection of the human environment DDC 30,000 Emergency and humanitarian action DDD 10,000 Essential drugs and other medicines FFA 30,000 Evidence for health policy GGA 40,000 External co-operation and partnership HHC 87,000 Communicable disease surveillance and response AAA 28,000 Communicable disease prevention and control AAB 256,000 Communicable disease eradication and elimination AAC 23,000 Prevention of non-communicative diseases BBB 5,000 Health systems CCA 183,000 Child and adolescent health and development CCB 49,000 Country Office COO 1,110,000 TOTAL US$2,003,000 6. UNESCO Within the framework of UNDAF, UNESCO will continue to advocate the attainment of the targets set by global Conventions. At the project level, UNESCO will, with due regard of its mandates, comparative advantages and resource base and whenever possible and feasible, assist in enhancing current and planned activities of the UN System in Namibia. In view of the challenges facing education in Namibia, and the constraints faced by the GRN in attaining the overall objectives of Jomtien on providing quality basic education for all, UNESCO will focus attention on the following areas:United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 64 of 134 capacity building in the area of curriculum reform taking into account new information communication technologies; capacity building in the production and provision of basic learning materials; support the provision of inclusive education for people living with disabilities; contribute to assessing and re-assesed pre-and in-service teacher training programmes and enhance the status of teachers; and strengthening partnership with NGOs and community participation in education reform. Under UNDAF, UNESCO will continue to contribute to poverty and inequality reduction and economic growth by supporting community development, and regional and development projects as well as specific activities for and with marginalised groups. UNESCO will contribute to the development of rural communities and to support the empowerment of marginalised groups, particularly women, youth, the elderly, San and Topnaar people through research, advocacy and specific target-group oriented activities. The perception of the role of the Social and Human Sciences Programme is to contribute to research on poverty related issues as well as to planning, implementing and monitoring of activities that follow an integrated and gender-oriented approach and target the most needy. UNESCO will continue contributing to the Ohangwena Pilot Poverty Reduction Programme. In addition, UNESCO hopes to be included in the National Task Force on Poverty Reduction (NTFPR). As far as target-group specific activities are concerned, it is envisaged to get involved in the following areas: strengthening participatory community development planning capacities; providing technical assistance to the preparation and implementing of regional development plans; providing technical assistance to leadership training for youth; and providing technical assistance for participatory gender-differentiated planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of activities addressing the reduction of poverty and inequality. UNESCO will continue working in the area of promoting tolerance, human rights, peace and democracy in the country.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 65 of 134UNESCO will contribute to promoting human rights and gender issues by continuing to work closely with scholars and researchers at the UNAM, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Women Affairs and Child Welfare and other concerned GRN and non- governmental entities. UNESCO will continue to include Namibia in sub-regional and regional activities in the areas of research and teaching of human rights, gender issues and democracy. As far as the provision of technical assistance is concerned, it is envisaged to get involved in training for victim-supportive sexual offences courts and in human rights training for the police and the defence force. With regard to communication, the focal areas of activities are as follows: promoting independent and pluralistic media; enhancing educational and cultural mission of public service broadcasting; encouraging women in the media to participate in the decision making process; highlighting and reinforcing the role of communication and information in addressing social issues (e.g. poverty alleviation, HIV/AIDS, human rights, democratic governance and social integration, etc.) and priority groups (youth and women); providing a forum for reflection and debate to increase access to information, promote cultural diversity and multilingualism in cyber-space, and to reduce violence on the screen or informatics-related crimes such as pedophilia on the Internet; building capacities of endogenous audiovisual production; providing training opportunities for information and informatics specialists; and enhancing the role of librarians and archives as gateways to information highways. Funding for Indicative Programme UNESCO is on a two year programme cycle, the last being 1998 - 1999 over which period the following breakdown was realised: Funding from UNESCO US$125,000. Extra budgetary (parallel) US$821,033.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 66 of 134In addition, Namibia participates in a sub-regional programme in communication and social and human science, totalling some US$ 2, 941, 769. 7. UNHCR There are an estimated 23,531 refugees in Namibia, the majority being Angolans (95%). Prolonged armed conflict in some countries (Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo) within the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) Region, continues to function as a push factor for refugees into Namibia, thereby adding burden on the social- economic infrastructure of the country. In addition to the assistance provided by UNHCR, GRN is allocating national resources to cover some of the health, education, administrative and logistical needs of registered camp refugees. Under UNDAF, UNHCR will continue to: utilise international and regional forums to address the root causes of regional armed conflicts; and assist GRN in formulating both emergency preparedness plans for large influx of refugees, and care and maintenance programmes for camp refugees. Funding for Indicative Programme Not available. 8. UNAIDS Under UNDAF, UNAIDS will continue to render assistance with a particular focus on the priority areas identified by the Secretariat of UNAIDS, within the national strategic plan on the prevention of HIV/AIDS. The current priority areas for the Secretariat include young people, highly vulnerable populations, prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, developing and implementing community standards of AIDS care and vaccine development. In Namibia, taking note of the current opportunities such as the Medium Term Plan II, the growing level of political commitment, the commitment of key actors like the NPCS to include the issue of HIV/AIDS in NDP2, the UN will continue to support the national response to contain the spread of HIV/AIDS. Taking the challenges mentioned above in combating the alarmingly spreading epidemic into consideration, the broad areas of the UN support to the national response on HIV/AIDS are mentioned as follows: In the area of Prevention efforts with emphasis on the Youth - providing support in the Development and implementation of Communication activities to prevent sexual transmission through the reduction of individual risk behaviour.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 67 of 134 In the area of Social Mobilisation - to create continuous awareness through established dialogue within and between communities, to continuously advocate for a sustained GRN commitment in the fight against AIDS, to identify policy gaps for advocacy messages and existing policy information for mass media dissemination etc. In the area of Impact Reduction - with the objective of raising awareness of discriminatory practices towards those infected and affected, combat violence against women and children, support activities on gender and human rights, enhance the provision of victim friendly low enforcement services in relation to sexual offences etc. In the area of Provision of Access to Services - To strengthen and expand counselling and other psychological support services, to strengthen and expand testing services, to improve case management of STD's, HIV Disease and AIDS, to improve and expand home based care, support groups and other support services for people living with and affected by HIV/AIDS, and to ensure an adequate care and support structure for children affected by HIV and AIDS, including orphans. Program Management and Development - To support the creation of national and regional management structures, assist in building capacity in management, monitoring and evaluation at all levels. Based on the broad areas of support, specific activities will be developed and implemented by UN Agencies depending on its comparative advantages and mandates. Areas for joint support by two or more agencies will also be identified. Opportunities of bringing in more partners from GRN, the NGOs, the Private Sector, PLHAs etc. will be expanded and strengthened, too.

The Environment UNDP has established the Environment Unit, which deals with environmental programmes and strives to mobilise resources for the country. UNDP Namibia is currently implementing a number of environmental programmes: Public Private Partnerships for Urban Environment (PPPUE) Programme . Under the UNDP's PPPUE Global Programme, Namibia has been selected as one of the seven priority countries for the formulation of national programmes. The programme aims to increase the access of the urban poor to basic urban services such as water, energy supply and waste management, through the promotion of public-private partnerships . The following projects are implemented by UNDP and funded primarily by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). GEF is a funding mechanism established in response to the 1992 Rio Conference. It addresses trans-boundary environmental issues such as the loss of biodiversity, the degradation of international waters and the threat of accelerated climate change. All GEF projects are implemented by one of the three GEF Implementing Agencies, namely UNDP, UNEP and World Bank, and co-financed by governments and development partners. OKAKOM - Environmental Protection and Sustainable Management of the Okavango River Basin , a regional project (Namibia, Botswana, Angola), aiming to formulate and implement the Strategic Action Programme (SAP) in order to achieve sustainable and integrated management of the Okavango Basin. BCLME - Integrated Management of the Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem Programme , aiming to formulate and implement a Strategic Action Programme (SAP) in order to achieve sustainable use of marine resources in the BCLME. This is a regional project involving Namibia, South Africa and Angola. Barrier Removal to Namibian Renewable Energy, assisting local stakeholders in building local capacities to promote, finance, install and maintain solar applications; helping to develop and implement favourable regulatory frameworks; facilitating the establishment of viable financial mechanism (micro, lending and mortgage additions) in order to help to reduce the barriers for development of the demand for solar technologies.

Selective Options for Resource Mobilisation and Collaboration During the interviews, selective options for the UN System were identified as regards resource mobilisation from, and collaboration with, the donor community in Namibia. This list of options is by no ways exhaustive and the UN System in Namibia in close co- operation with GRN and the Donor community will strive to increase the resource base and options for collaboration. So far, the following opportunities will be explored under UNDAF: 1. European Union Under the new ACP-EU development co-operation arrangement, the parties to the agreement \"recognise the complementary role of and potential for contributions by non- state actors to the development process\"36. When dealing with the issues of actors of the ACP-EU partnership, the agreement stipulates that non-state actors, where appropriate: be informed and involved in consultation on co-operation policies and strategies, on priorities and on the political dialogue; be provided with financial resources in order to support local development processes; be involved in the implementation of co-operation projects and programmes in areas that concern them or where these actors have a comparative advantage; and be provided with capacity-building support in order to reinforce the capabilities of these actors, particularly as regards organisation and representation, the establishment of consultation mechanisms, and the promotion of strategic alliances. For Namibia, the above-mentioned provision would require, amongst others, the identification (or establishment) of representative umbrella organisations and the institutional strengthening of these associations. UNICEF is currently supporting the strengthening of the National Early Childhood Development NGO Association. Similar associations could be identified or established in order to facilitate increased popular participation in the development process (e.g. NANGOF). Special focus could be put on the youth and on women to enhance both the UN's mandates and the EU's aid delivery arrangement. 2. Sweden Sweden, in close co-operation with GRN, is currently assessing the possibility to introduce a sector -wide approach to its development co-operation programme with Namibia in favour of the current project-based method, especially with regard to the education sector. The suggestion is to jointly develop policies, strategies and action plans, identify methods of evaluation and verification and to make an annual lump-sum deposit 36 Reference: New ACP-EU Partnership Agreement, 2000-2030, Chapter 2, Article 4United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 75 of 134in favour of the co-operating Ministry(ies) with the State Revenue Fund of the Ministry of Finance. Should more donors follow the example, co-ordination of the resulting development effort could be entrusted with the UN System. 3. The Netherlands The Netherlands will phase out its current development co-operation arrangement with Namibia. GRN has been given the indication that future development assistance could be rendered in the following areas: strengthen the role of civil society in its interface with the legislature; provide court system training and assist in the decentralisation process; assist the public service sector to become more service oriented, better accessible, enhance research capacity and access to information, and assist in combating corruption if so requested by GRN; provide the media with an enabling legal framework to access information, assist in the establishment of a self-regulatory body, and enhance public debate through culture and theatre; support and build the capacity of marginalised organisations; strengthen the investigation capacity of the Office of the Ombudsman; and provide training to the electoral commission as an ongoing process and assist in the continuous updating of voter roles, training of party agents, and assist in the establishment of an independent and easily accessible adjudicative electoral structure. Under UNDAF, the UN System in Namibia will consider close association and collaboration with formulation and execution of the intended programme. 4. United States of America The objectives of USAID's planned HIV/AIDS intervention, currently outside of the MTP2 framework, have been summarised as follows: the HIV prevention programme will cover the economically vital and particularly afflicted Walvis Bay area of the Erongo Region; the interventions will be concentrated on counselling, voluntary testing, availability of condoms, education and STD (Sexually Transmitted Disease);United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 76 of 134 the project will start towards the middle of 2001 after a 12 months baseline study has been completed; the intervention is regarded as a pilot project to be replicated if proven to be effective; drug delivery is not envisaged; and USAID aims to de-focus on the health aspects when dealing with HIV/AIDS. The results of the pilot programme could be of particular importance to the post-UNDAF country programming of the UN System's response to the threat posed by HIV/AIDS. 5. The United Kingdom Of particular interest to the UN System is the fact that the United Kingdom is phasing out its bilateral assistance programmes. (i.e. new, major interventions will commence as of 2000), in favour of an initiative that will address the issue of poverty within a regional perspective. The Department for International Development (DfID) is currently formulating a strategy for this new approach and a first draft will be circulated before the end of 2000. It is expected, that the study will be completed by 2002. The UN System in Namibia will provide inputs into the intended programme formulation. 6. France The French Government entered into an agreement of co-operation with the UNDP, the provisions of which still have to be realised at the country level. In its attempt to have Namibia's status as \"as if least developed\" country revived, the help of France could be counted on. Namibia, having been accorded the status of middle- income country by the UN, still enjoys France's continued development assistance. Despite this and the fact that the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recommended that France should concentrate its aid on the least developed countries, the French Government justified its sustained commitment to Namibia on the basis of its highly skewed levels of income distribution.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 77 of 134ANNEX 1 - The United Nations System in Namibia A. Mission Statement The UN System in Namibia exists to promote, support and monitor policy formulation, implementation and accountability in terms of international development norms and values, with particular reference to UN International Conferences, Conventions and Human Rights Standards. To this end, the UN System will use its limited programme resources for strategic and catalytic interventions to develop management capacity for sustainable human development in response to national priorities with particular focus on poverty, inequity, and HIV/AIDS reduction. The UN's view of development is people-centred with emphasis on poverty reduction and the elimination of inequalities. Accordingly, the role of the UN System in Namibia has been to advocate those policies and programmes that underscore the dignity of people and the equality of rights of men and women. The human rights based approach to development has been an important area of advocacy, involving decentralisation, participation of beneficiaries and an integrated approach to development. B. A Human Rights Approach to Programming Human rights are fundamental to the work of the United Nations. Agencies and Funds of the UN System are guided by the United Nations Charter, and have a responsibility to support the realisation of human rights. Human rights are expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the two Covenants on Civil and Political Rights, and Social, Economic and Cultural Rights. While the general public has commonly understood human rights to mean civil and political rights, there is an increasing recognition that the rights to survival, good health, education and development are also human rights that need to be equally pursued and protected. Additional Human Rights instruments exist, for instance the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), or the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). These and other conventions reinforce human rights principles that are applicable to all human beings, and have been formulated to ensure protection for especially vulnerable groups. UN Agencies, according to their specific mandate, use such instruments as point of reference. All human rights are premised on several strategic principles. One is the principle of universality or non-discrimination. All people, whether man or women, old or young, with or without disabilities, and regardless their creed or ethnic origin are equally entitled to all human rights. All rights are indivisible and interrelated, and no right is more important than another. This does not preclude deciding on priorities for action, which is necessary given resource limitations. Important concepts inherent to the pursuance of human rights are the principles of human dignity and participation. Another strongUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 78 of 134underlying principle is that social interdependence or solidarity on the part of communities and society is required to realise human rights. This requires a social trust involving reliance in social relationships and partnerships so that the expectations of right holders are not denied or neglected. An important element of a human rights approach is the concept of accountability. Human rights have correlative duties or obligations for their realisation. A right as a claim or interest signifies that the duty bearer against whom the claim can be made must not only be identified, but also made accountable for the realisation of that right. The identification of duty bearers and the extent of their accountabilities are crucial. The performance of duties correlative to human rights depends on the duty bearer's capacities. The person or institution must first accept the responsibility to carry out the duty. Secondly, he or she must have the authority to carry out the duty. Thirdly, the person or institution must have access to and control of resources, including material resources, knowledge, skills and organisational resources. The ratification of human rights instruments and conventions by the State indicates acceptance of its responsibility. A human rights approach to programming aims to assess where human rights are violated. In many instances, human rights are not fulfilled at the household level. In other cases, human rights are not fulfilled at the service level, or by the absence of supporting policies or budget allocations. In each scenario, duty bearers can be identified, and a human rights approach will strengthen the capacity of those duty bearers to enable them to perform adequately. Where lack of, or inadequate quality of Government services present serious risks to human rights, improvement of service provision will remain an important strategy. In all cases, the onus is on Government to provide for the conditions and an enabling environment, which may involve the creation of legal and administrative framework and the formulation of supportive policies. The guiding principles of participation are likely to be better understood when people, especially members of vulnerable groups are accepted as claim-holders of rights, or subject of rights. Under a human rights approach, the process by which the fulfilment of rights is achieved is as important as the outcome. In contrast to an approach based merely on charity or needs, a rights approach has to be empowering37. C. Objectives of UN Development Co-operation The objective of the UN System in Namibia is to support GRN to achieve higher levels of sustainable human development with particular consideration to poverty reduction within a human rights approach. This has so far been based upon: 37 Source: UNICEF draft to be discussed, amended and adopted by the UN System in NamibiaUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 79 of 134 the declared policies outlined in NDP1 which focus on poverty reduction through a decrease in unemployment and inequalities as well as by creating the right enabling environment for sustainable growth; the consensus from the global UN sponsored conferences of the 1990s such as the World Conference on Education for All (Jomtien, 1990), the World Summit for Children (New York, 1990), the UN Conference on Environment and Development (Rio de Janeiro, 1992), the International Conference on Nutrition (Rome, 1992), the World Summit on Human Rights (Vienna, 1993), the International Conference on Population and Development (Cairo, 1994), the Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing, 1995), the World Summit for Social Development (Copenhagen, 1996), the International Conference on Human Settlements (Istanbul, 1996) and the World Food Summit Conferences (Rome, 1996); and the unique mandates and missions of the various UN Agencies. In the light of the above perception of the national development challenges and the agreed strategic approach of collaboration with GRN, the UN System focused its contributions in the 1990s on the following areas38: Poverty Reduction, with the objective to develop new approaches, models and strategies to reduce poverty through accelerating economic growth, reducing inequalities among various sections of the population as well as specific programmes targeted to poverty reduction. Employment Generation and the Promotion of SMEs, with the objective to create employment and income generating activities especially in the rural areas, and to create the enabling environment for the private sector to become an engine for economic growth. Capacity Building for National Development, with the objective to contribute to the human resource development and institution building required for national development. Access to Basic Social Services, with the objective to increase access to basic social services, thereby enhancing GRN's efforts to achieve goals set for quality education and health, and to control communicable diseases especially AIDS. Gender and Development, with the objective to support the implementation of the National Gender Policy and post-Beijing strategies for the Advancement of Women. Good Governance, with the objective to contribute to processes aimed at promoting the institutional innovations required to guide and manage an increasingly complex society and to ensure that the benefits of development are shared more equally. 38 Source: Common Country Assessment, 1999United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 80 of 134 Harnessing Technology for Development, Development Communication and Advocacy, with the objectives to contribute to the development of indigenous capacities for scientific research and technological innovation, and to raise the profile of the UN sponsored international conferences and ensure that their messages reach those at the grass roots levels by promoting participatory development. Environmental Management to Ensure Sustainable Natural Resource Management with Special Emphasis on Water Availability, Food Security and Biodiversity Conservation, with the objective to advance environmentally sustainable development through the formulation and implementation of strategies which, while recognising the environment as a resource, provide for its protection and conservation in the interests of future generations. In order to reduce the administrative burden on the UN System and GRN alike and to render development co-operation more effective, further steps will be initiated to synchronise programme cycles. D. Harmonisation and Simplification The current programmes of UNDP and UNFPA cover the 1997-2000 period, while UNICEF's cycle stretches from 1997 until 2001. It has been agreed that UNICEF's next Country Programme will be shortened to four years to be in harmony with the UNDG (United Nations Development Group) Agencies' programme cycles. UNICEF and UNFPA will synchronise their respective programme cycles as of 2001, and a formal agreement to this effect has to be entered into. Under UNDAF, Coun try Programmes of the Agencies will be aligned with the plan period covered by NDP2. There is mutual support in the use of logistical and administrative resources and facilities. The field level committee has also brought about common training in areas such as national execution of projects, HIV/AIDS and the French Language. Collaboration has also been effected in the implement ation of information technology activities. Mid-term reviews for UNICEF, UNFPA and UNDP will be conducted jointly in the interests of harmonisation of programme cycles and as an input into UNDAF. During the UNICEF/GRN Mid-Term Review, WHO, UNFPA and UNESCO participated in field visits and follow-up discussions. The UNDG Agencies were also involved in each other's Mid-Term Review meetings. Under UNDAF, necessary administrative measures will be prepared to ensure even closer collaboration during subsequent review meetings by harmonising the corporate guidelines of the participating Agencies.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 81 of 134E. The United Nations System in Namibia 1. United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) a) Global Mandate UNDP: Is the development programme arm of the United Nations and upholds the vision of the United Nations Charter. UNDP is represented at country level by a Resident Representative who normally serves as Resident Co-ordinator of the operational activities of the UN System, supporting, at the request of governments, the co- ordination of development and humanitarian assistance. Resident Co-ordinators also help to orchestrate the full intellectual and technical resources of the UN System in support of national development It is committed to the principle that development is inseparable from the quest for peace and human security and that the United Nations must be a strong force for development as well as for peace. UNDP acts to help the United Nations family to become a unified and powerful force for sustainable human development and works to strengthen international co-operation for sustainable human development. At the request of governments and in support of its areas of focus, assists in building capacity for good governance, popular participation, civil empowerment, private and public sector development and growth with equity, stressing that national plans and priorities constitute the only viable frame of reference for the national programming of operational activities for development within the United Nations System. Strives to be an effective development partner for the United Nations relief agencies, working to sustain livelihoods while they seek to sustain lives. It acts to help countries to prepare for, avoid and manage complex emergencies and disasters. Draws on expertise from around the world, including from developing countries, United Nations Specialised Agencies, civil society organisations and research institutes. Supports South-South co-operation, by actively promoting the exchange of experience among developing countries. Supports, within its areas of focus, technology transfer, adaptation, and access to the most effective technology. Receives voluntary contributions from nearly every country in the world. Seeks to ensure a predictable flow of resources to support its programmes. It provides grant funds through criteria based on universality that strongly favour low-income countries, particularly the least developed. Is politically neutral and its co-operation is impartial. It seeks to conduct its work in a manner transparent and accountable to all its stakeholders. Is committed to a process of continuing self-evaluation and reform. It aims to improve its own efficiency and effectiveness and to assist the UN System in becoming a stronger force for the benefit of the people and countries of the world. Supports the development of an international development co-operation framework that responds to changing global, regional and national circumstances.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 82 of 134The comparative advantages are that UNDP posses some 130 field offices providing knowledge and information to meet country needs; as a member of the UN System, operates in a politically neutral manner in addressing the countries' development challenges; is the conduit for grant technical assistance within the UN System; has wide access to specialised expertise within the UN Specialised Agencies; assists in fund mobilisation through Round Tables or jointly through the World Bank Consultative Group. The Country Co-operation Framework (CCF), covering the period 1997 to 2000, responds to the national development objectives and targets as contained in NDP1 and is consistent with the country's commitments at global UN conferences. The CCF is the result of a consultative process that involved the GRN, UN Agencies, the donor community and the Country Office. The CCF focuses specifically on the following areas: capacity building for development management, including economic management; good governance, regional and local management, research, networks and scientific exchanges; integrated community -based rural and urban poverty reduction; small -, medium and micro -scale enterprise and entrepreneurship development; and water management. The CCF was approved in March 1997 with TRAC 1 and 2 resources amounting to US$ 3.8 million, less by US $450,000 borrowed for activities executed during 1996.The core funds thus totalled US$ 3.35 million. UNDP utilised US$ 192,000 SPPD funds to assist GRN, in collaboration with the World Bank, in the preparation of the water sector programme. US$ 1.740 million were mobilised as cost sharing along with US $2.08 million from bilateral donors: Norway, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Austria. As such, funding for the water sector totalled US$ 4.01 million, bringing the total funding through UNDP to US$ 7.36 million for the 1997-2000 period broken down as follows: Poverty Reduction US$ 1,235,000 Support to SME US$ 656,000 Support to Good Governance US$ 254,000 Capacity Building for Economic Management US$ 1,200,000 Water US$ 4,010,000 Advocacy for achieving SHD and policy advice have been the main preoccupations of the Country Office. The Country Programme Review of November 1999 noted that the supported programmes consist of a combination of upstream and downstream activities, with upstream activities particularly evident in the Capacity Building for Economic Management and in the Support to Good Governance programmes, with the other two programmes also embracing some upstream components.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 83 of 134Through its advocacy on HIV/AIDS, working as part of the UN Country Team, for example, the country moved from denial to more open discussion and ultimately to a national strategy for dealing with the pandemic. Advocacy on poverty reduction, not only led to a national strategy on poverty reduction, but also to joint action by the UN Agencies in the Ohangwena pilot project. Other areas for advocacy were: governance, the participatory approach to development, gender issues, and the launch of a participatory Namibia 2030 Vision. The Country Office has at the operational level: assisted GRN with several studies; strengthened co-operation between the UN Agencies leading to the production of several joint reports; mobilised resources; successfully implemented technical assistance projects; and utilised the cost-effective UNV Programme to provide services of qualified and experienced officers to GRN. The main findings of the review were (1) that the emphasis on advocacy on such critical SHD issues in the area of poverty, the environment, gender, improved governance, and long term strategic planning is appropriate, and (2) that future modalities should embrace the programme approach and national execution should be employed in all programmes. The dwindling resource base would suggest greater emphasis on advocacy and in particular, assisting the GRN with strategic thinking and planning and playing a catalytic role for resource mobilisation. One area in which advocacy and strategic thinking is required is anti- corruption. The anti-corruption conference, held in October 1998 in Windhoek, stressed the seriousness of GRN's efforts to combat the problem. One of the main recommendations of the conference was the establishment of a fully funded and independent anti-corruption agency. Assistance in articulating a clearly defined strategy could also facilitate the mobilisation of resources for the funding of an anti-corruption agency. The participatory approach in all stages of programme selection, design, formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation is essential for ownership of programmes, which is a fundamental requirement for their successful implementation as well as for their sustainability. UNDP's advocacy would be essential in supporting Government's effort. Already, additional resources have been mobilised in support of civic sensitisation for the decentralisation programme. Additional resources may be required for the operationalisation of the various committees. The severe shortage of skills would suggest that capacity building remain a major focus for future intervention. Support should however be selective and targeted at the policy level. Through advocacy by the UNDP in particular and the UN System in general, the HIV/AIDS pandemic has been recognised as posing a serious threat to socio-economic development. Given that poverty is a major determining factor in the cause of HIV/AIDS future poverty reduction intervention should target this problem. Here also, we see the UNDP being a catalyst for resource mobilisation in support of such programmes.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 84 of 134The UNDP Country Office, following on the release of the new Administrator's Business Plan held a two-day retreat to deliberate on the challenges ahead, and to develop a pro forma master plan for strategic UNDP interventions in the near to medium term. Namibia's first post-Independence decade has been one of setting in motion the nation- building process. Namibia has made laudable progress in the areas of institutional building and policy design, and has been an important partner in these processes. However, policy implementation has been weak and thus limited the translation of these policies into the expected benefits to the majority of the people. In fact, the mid-term review of NDP1 of March 1999 identified the lack of policy implementation capacity as an important factor in the underachievement of the Plan objectives. Namibia inherited a highly fragmented society as a result of the policy of apartheid. The legacy of this fragmentation is that a large proportion of the population participates only marginally in mainstream development and particularly in decision-making at any level. This seriously constrains development and nation building . For Namibia to make the transition required to be able to spread the benefits of independence to the majority of its people, the ability of the Government to target resources strategically becomes of critical importance. Following from the above, and bearing in mind the severe human resource deficit, the removal of poverty in the shortest possible time emerges as the overarching objective over the medium to long term, through 2010, with a number of instruments to be marshalled in support of this objective. In this regard, a national governance framework that promotes human rights with active focus on the right to development has been recognised as being the most effective way of creating the most conducive environment for advancing human development in a country. Besides this overarching developmental objective, over the past five years, HIV/AIDS has emerged as one of the most serious development challenges Namibia has ever faced. The near term catastrophic consequences of this scourge require UNDP to elevate to a second objective of future UNDP intervention assistance for HIV/AIDS. UNDP will therefore entertain two operational objectives over the near term: poverty reduction and assistance to HIV/AIDS. In view of UNDP's comparative advantage and its history in the country, the most strategic levels of intervention are those of 'advocacy' and 'policy advice'. However, for specific focus areas, capacity building will be an important instrument at the level of 'programme support'. Selected 'pilot projects' in the field will also be utilised to demonstrate innovative, sustainable and replicable approaches to poverty reduction.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 85 of 134b) UNDP within the Framework of UNDAF In supporting Namibia in its efforts towards poverty reduction, UNDP will assist in strengthening the capacity of the institutions that support the realisation and enlargement of human rights. Key area of intervention will include the legislature, judiciary, central, regional and local authorities. The following impact target areas have been identified: Economic management, specifically in the areas of fine-tuning of the macro- economic framework, developing pro-poor sectoral and meso-policies, aid co- ordination and sectoral policy co-ordination. As a pre-condition for the above, a long-term 'Vision 2030' would be developed through a participatory process. As a support to the above, a comprehensive programme for institutional building and human resource development would be designed. Public administration, specifically in supporting the process of decentralisation, making the public service more effective through promotion of public service ethics, rationalisation of the civil service and accountability of public enterprises. Employment creation, income generation and natural resource management . Assistance to HIV-AIDS intervention , particularly in terms of advocacy, awareness creation and aid co-ordination and mitigation. Three strategic objectives emerge: assist GRN to strengthen the policy implementation and co-ordination capacity; strengthen the capacity of GRN to enable civil society at large to participate more effectively in the development process; and strengthen the GRN's capacity for aid co-ordination with a view to mobilising resources. c) Funding for Indicative Programme It is too early to provide a good estimate of core programming costs, but the level of resources at US$ 3.4 million available over the 1197 through 2000 cycle is being entertained.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 86 of 1342. United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) a) Global Mandate UNFPA extends assistance to developing countries, countries with economies in transition and other countries at their request to help them address reproductive health and population issues, and raises awareness of these issues in all countries, as it has since its inception. UNFPA's three main areas of work are: to help ensure universal access to reproductive health, including family planning and sexual health, to all couples and individuals on or before the year 2015; to support population and development strategies that enable capacity-building in population programming; to promote awareness of population and development issues and to advocate for the mobilisation of the resources and political will necessary to accomplish its areas of work. UNFPA is guided by, and promotes, the principles of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (1994). In particular, UNFPA affirms its commitment to reproductive rights, gender equality and male responsibility, and to the autonomy and empowerment of women everywhere. UNFPA believes that safeguarding and promoting these rights, and promoting the well-being of children, especially girl children, are development goals in themselves. All couples and individuals have the right to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children as well as the right to the information and means to do so. UNFPA is convinced that meeting these goals will contribute to improving the quality of life and to the universally accepted aim of stabilising world population. We also believe that these goals are an integral part of all efforts to achieve sustained and sustainable social and economic development that meets human needs, ensures well-being and protects the natural resources on which all life depends. UNFPA recognises that all human rights, including the right to development, are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, as expressed in the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, the Vienna Declaration and the Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights, the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development, the Platform for Action of the Fourth World Conference on Women and in other internationally agreed instruments. UNFPA, as the lead United Nations organisation for the follow-up and implementation of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, is fully committed to working in partnership with governments, all parts of the UN System, development banks, bilateral aid agencies, non-governmental organisations and civil society. UNFPA strongly supports the United Nations Resident Co-ordinator system and the implementation of all relevant United Nations decisions.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 87 of 134UNFPA will assist in the mobilisation of resources from both developed and developing countries, following the commitments made by all countries in the Programme of Action to ensure that the goals of the International Conference on Population and Development are met. Past Experience in Namibia The Second Country Programme (1997-2000) was approved by the Executive Board in March 1997 to the amount of US$ 6.1 million (US$3.6 million from regular resources and US$2.5 million from other resources). It was designed on the basis of the Programme Review and Strategy Development (PRSD) exercise undertaken in 1996. It consists of three sub-programmes (1) Reproductive Health (RH), including Family Planning and Sexual Health, which was allocated US$2 million from regular resources and US$1.8 million from other resources; (2) Population and Development Strategies (PDS), which was allocated US$1.1 million from regular resources and US$0.7 million from other resources; and (3) Advocacy, which was allocated US$0.5 million from regular resources. A total of eight component projects were implemented under the three sub-programmes in addition to the Umbrella Project, the printing of the Programme Review and Strategy Development Report and the procurement of condoms through the UN Theme Group on HIV/AIDS At the Mid-Term Review of the Second Country Programme, it was recognised that many of the targets established were unrealistic, given the inadequate understanding at the time of the formulation of the Second Country Programme of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and of its effects on the population growth rate, fertility rates and mortality rates, as well as the weak institutional analysis in terms of national capacity and the pace of decentralisation and the lack of clarity about geographical focus. As a result, the introduction of the logical framework approach by UNFPA led to the formulation of a goal for the Second Country Programme and purposes and outputs for the three sub-programmes more in line with the emerging population and development situation of the country. The goal of the Second Country Programme is to contribute to the improvement of the quality of life of the Namibian population through assistance to GRN for the implementation of the National Population Policy for Sustainable Human Development , with emphasis in the areas of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights and Gender Equality and Equity. Population and Development Strategies The purpose of the PDS sub-programme is to contribute to the integration of population and gender issues in the national process of sectoral planning and programming through the strengthening of both human and institutional capacity for the development and implementation of the National Plan of Action for Population Policy Implementation.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 88 of 134The outputs of the PDS sub-programme are (1) strengthened institutional capacity of the National Planning Commission Secretariat and the line ministries to develop and apply appropriate gender-sensitive demographic and socio-economic indicators for monitoring the implementation of the National Population Policy for Sustainable Human Development and related aspects of Namibia's First National Development Plan (1995- 2000) ; and (2) strengthened institutional capacity of the University of Namibia to design, assist and implement training and research programmes in the field of population and development studies. There are two component projects under the PDS sub-programme. (1) Implementation of Namibia's Population Policy - is executed by ILO and UNFPA and implemented by the NPCS and (2) Strengthening Institutional Capacity for Training and Research at UNAM - is executed by UNFPA and implemented by the University of Namibia. Recommendations for future support to the PDS sub-programme in the Third Country Programme include selective continued training and technical assistance to strengthen human resource capacity and management skills for the national population programme at NPCS, UNAM, selected line Ministries and Regions; support for the production of gender-sensitive population and development indicators to assist annual monitoring and results-based management of the national population programme through technical assistance to Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) for the 2001 Census, survey management and analysis related to Adolescent Reproductive Health, strengthening of the Health Information System to better support data needs related to Adolescent Reproductive Health; and provision of relevant technical equipment and resource materials. Reproductive Health including Family Planning and Sexual Health The purpose of the RH sub-programme is to contribute to Sexual and Reproductive Health behavioural change and increased utilisation of comprehensive and quality RH services and information, especially STI/HIV/AIDS prevention by women, men and adolescents in a gender-sensitive political and social environment. The outputs of the RH sub-programme are (1) improved capacity of the Reproductive Health Programme, National AIDS Co-ordination Programme, IEC, Research and Health Information System (HIS) personnel at all levels to effectively manage and implement integrated RH services with special emphasis on Health Education; (2) improved capacity of the Ministry of Higher Education, Training and Employment Creation for the provision of adolescent sexual and reproductive health counselling and services through community-based peer education programmes and multi-purpose youth resource centres; (3) improved capacity of the Namibia Planned Parenthood Association (NAPPA) to conduct advocacy, community mobilisation and community-based education and activities on adolescent sexual and reproductive health issues, especially in the North East and North West Regions of the country; (4) population education, including reproductive health, STI/HIV/AIDS, sexuality and gender issues, institutionalised in formal, adult continuing and teacher education; and (5) increased male participation inUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 89 of 134RH issues, including contraceptive use, STI/HIV/AIDS prevention, conflict resolution, gender roles and responsibilities within the family, in the North West Health Directorate. There are five component projects under the RH sub-programme. (1) Institutionalising Population Education - is executed by the Ministry of Basic Education, Sport and Culture and UNFPA and implemented by the National Institute for Educational Development (NIED); (2) Youth as Partners in Health - is executed by the Ministry of Higher Education, Training and Employment Creation and UNFPA and implemented by the Directorate of Youth; (3) Reproductive Health (RH) including Family Planning (FP), Sexual Health (SH), IEC, HIS, Research - is executed by UNFPA and implemented by the MoHSS; (4) Capacity Building of NAPPA- is executed by NAPPA and UNFPA and is implemented by NAPPA; (5) Male Involvement in RH- is executed by the Northwest Health Directorate, Margaret Sanger Center International and UNFPA and is implemented by the Northwest Health Directorate. Recommendations for future support to the RH sub-programme in the Third Country Programme include a strong focus on Adolescent Reproductive Health in terms of meeting the ICPD+5 targets; more attention to logistics and supply issues in relation to RH commodities, especially the procurement of male and female condoms for HIV/AIDS prevention; improving the timely release of HIS data for analysis and programme monitoring and intervention purposes; finalisation, adoption and implementation of the draft RH Policy; ensuring that teachers are trained in population education and that Life Skills becomes a compulsory and examinable subject in the school curriculum; expanding male involvement in RH to selected Regions and more partner groups; and increased socio-cultural research on RH issues in selected Regions. Advocacy The purpose of the Advocacy sub-programme is to contribute to increased commitment and support among policy-makers, implementers, traditional and religious leaders and the community for the implementation of the relevant policies related to population and gender, as well as the creation of an enabling socio-cultural environment in order to secure provision and utilisation of sexual and reproductive health services for the achievement of sexual and reproductive rights of men, women and adolescents. UNFPA contributed to the achievement of this purpose by sending politicians and senior officials to international conferences, conducting regional workshops to launch the National Population Policy for Sustainable Human Development, supported the drafting of the National Action Plan for Population Policy Implementation, assisted in the dissemination of the National Gender Policy, and aided the drafting of the National Plan of Action on Gender . In addition, UNFPA was requested to support research on the prevalence of abortion in Namibia. The output of the Advocacy sub-programme is strengthened technical and managerial capacity of stakeholders in advocacy, social mobilisation, strategy development, research, material development, programme Co-ordination and management in addressing issuesUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 90 of 134related to sexual and reproductive health and rights, HIV/AIDS prevention and gender equity and equality among men, women and adolescents. One component project under the Advocacy sub-programme, Population Advocacy, is executed by UNFPA and implemented by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Information and Broadcasting. The Advocacy sub-programme has provided inputs in relation to the output of strengthening technical and managerial capacity of stakeholders Recommendations in relation to advocacy in the Third Country Programme include the integration of advocacy as a cross-cutting issue under the proposed PDS and RH sub- programmes, rather than as a separate sub-programme as it has been under the Second Country Programme. This is also in line with the recommendation made during the Mid- Term Review of the Second Country Programme. b) UNFPA'S Comparative Advantage The implementation of the National Population Policy for Sustainable Human Development is one of the main strategies for reducing poverty in Namibia and is an area where UNFPA enjoys a comparative advantage in terms of the support it has provided to the strengthening of national institutions involved in the implementation of the national population programme. Future needs are to alert policy makers to the development and health implications of the emerging demographics of HIV/AIDS and to support policy implementation at the Regional level in order to have greater impact on the population as a whole and in line with the ongoing decentralisation process. Regional AIDS Co-ordination Committees (RACOC), chaired by Governors, with Regional Health Management Teams, Regional Youth Offices, Regional Information Offices, NGOs and Community Based Organisations (CBOs), as part of RACOCs, provide a strategic niche for future UNFPA support in terms of catalytic interventions in line with the co-ordinated implementation of national population, gender and HIV/AIDS prevention programmes. This is also in line with the MTR recommendation that UNFPA support, in the context of UNDAF, should focus on the National Population Policy for Sustainable Human Development , the National Gender Policy and the National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS . The CCA/UNDAF process in Namibia has identified Poverty Reduction, HIV/AIDS Prevention and Governance, Gender and Human Rights as the major national priority areas in the draft Second National Development Plan to be addressed collectively by the UN System in Namibia. UN estimates indicate that the HIV prevalence rates for females aged 15-24 ranged from 18.78% to 20.82%, while for males aged 15-24, the estimated HIV prevalence rates ranged from 7.89% to 10.38%. During the 1999 UNGASS on ICPD+5, it was agreed that by 2005, at least 90% of young women and men aged 15-24 should have access to information and skills required to reduce their vulnerability to HIV infection, while HIV incidence in 15-24 year olds should be reduced by 25%. Given the urgency of this issue, this will be the major area of focus in developing the Third Country Programme.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 91 of 134UNFPA's comparative advantage lies in building on the work already done during the Second Country Programme in terms of support for Adolescent and Youth Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights through the Directorate of Youth, NAPPA, NIED and the Adolescent Reproductive Health (ARH) proposal currently submitted for funding to the EU; the male involvement in RH project; and the joint programming with UNICEF on Youth Health, with UNAIDS support, through which UNFPA has been procuring male and female condoms. In addition, UNFPA has significant experience within the Country Support Team (CST) on ARH services and IEC, well-established condom procurement facilities at Headquarters and the ability to design condom distribution systems for adolescents. The recent impetus gained by hosting the 4th Regional Conference of African Women Ministers and Parliamentarians in Namibia also provides an opportunity to build on the strong support provided by President Nujoma and the Government to the theme of meeting the challenge of Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health Needs in Sub- Saharan Africa. c) Meeting the Funding Requirements for the Third Country Programme Initiatives are already underway through UNFPA Headquarters to raise US$7.5 million from the European Union, the Government of the Netherlands and various Foundations for a Namibian Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health (ASRH) proposal and the NPCS has been asked to support the UNFPA request at the country level through the local European Union Office to reinforce the request. In addition, applications will be made through UNAIDS Programme Acceleration Funds and International Partnership Against AIDS in Africa (IPAA) funds for support to the RH sub-programme. The UN Theme Group on HIV/AIDS has been successful in raising over US$1 million for Namibia and the current joint programming between UNICEF and UNFPA on HIV/AIDS prevention among adolescents and youth is also receiving support from the Government of Sweden. There are also possibilities, currently being explored with UNAM and NPCS, that the Government of Sweden will consider supporting the PDS sub-programme by funding the extension of the contract of the Chief Technical Adviser (CTA) at UNAM through UNFPA. he focus on HIV/AIDS prevention among adolescents and youth should attract donor interest from other quarters as well. The Government of Luxembourg has provided support to the Male Involvement in RH component project in the Second Country Programme and the continuation and expansion of this project in the Third Country Programme is also likely to attract their interest, following the submission of the final evaluation reports of the component project and the Second Country Programme. There are thus strong possibilities of mobilising the additional multi-bilateral resources required for the Third Country Programme. In the event that additional resources will not be available, the geographical scale covered by UNFPA regular resources will be relatively limited. However, the geographicalUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 92 of 134coverage will be expanded in accordance with other resources mobilised. In any event, UNFPA will fund a comprehensive approach at Regional level in which, in the same geographic area, support will be provided to make health facilities more adolescent and youth friendly; expand male involvement in RH; provide SRH information and counselling services through multi-purpose youth resource centres; ensure peer educators work with out-of-school youth; ensure that teachers are trained in Life Skills and that Life Skills becomes a compulsory and examinable subject in the school curriculum; and that multiple and easily accessible sources of condoms are established and maintained. South-South collaboration will take the form of exchanges of relevant experiences and training opportunities in the context of SADC and IPAA initiatives on HIV/AIDS prevention among adolescents and youth, the follow-up to the 4th Regional Conference of African Women Ministers and Parliamentarians and other population and development related activities identified during the Third Country Programme. d) UNFPA within the Framework of UNDAF On the basis of the recommendations of the Second Country Programme Evaluation and the UNDAF, the Third Country Programme will address three major problems. These are: 1) the rapid rise in Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI)/HIV/AIDS among adolescents and youth, affecting females in particular, with the attendant effect on morbidity and mortality; 2) maternal mortality associated with teenage pregnancies; and 3) the high rate of gender-based violence and sexual abuse. The goal of the Third Country Programme will be to contribute to the reduction of HIV/AIDS incidence among 15-24 year old Namibians in line with the ICPD+5 target; the reduction of maternal mortality among female adolescents and youth; and the reduction of gender-based violence and sexual abuse among adolescents and youth. Two sub-programmes, Reproductive Health (RH), including Family Planning and Sexual Health, and Population and Development Strategies (PDS) will be developed to contribute to the achievement of this goal with advocacy for gender concerns built into both sub-programmes. The purpose of the RH sub-programme at national level will be to contribute to a reduction in the behaviour placing individual adolescents and youth at risk of STI/HIV/AIDS infections and teenage pregnancies. In selected Regions, the purpose will be to contribute to attitudinal and behavioural change in relation to STI/HIV/AIDS and teenage pregnancy, including acceptance by young males of female reproductive rights and male responsibility for achieving these.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 93 of 134The purpose of the PDS sub-programme will be to contribute to the prioritisation of HIV/AIDS prevention interventions among adolescents and youth at Regional level, in the context of decentralisation and the National Plan of Action for Population Policy Implementation. The strategies that will be adopted to contribute to the achievement of the goal and purposes include communication for behaviour change; technical and managerial capacity building; advocacy; social mobilisation and community empowerment; socio- cultural and operational research; and the provision of services, equipment and supplies. These strategies will be operationalised through component project activities involving strategic training; strengthening of management skills; procurement of RH commodities; advocacy and IEC message and material development, production and diffusion; and integrated socio-cultural and operational research. The implementation of the component projects will lead to the development of personal motivation for behavioural change among adolescents and youth based on increased knowledge and attitudinal changes, access to RH services and commodities and more control over decision making by females. This will also provide the context for developing achievable outputs for which the sub- programmes are accountable. These outputs will result in attitudinal and behavioural changes in relation to the utilisation of RH services and related benefits in terms of gender roles and responsibilities; increases in terms of financial and geographical accessibility of RH services and commodities; increases in terms of technical capacity to make available RH services and commodities; and legal and cultural acceptability, through normative change, of RH services and commodities. The RH sub-programme will have four outputs: (1) at national level, accessibility of condoms by all sexually active adolescents and youth; (2) at national level, creation of a supportive policy and legal environment for the provision of Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) information and services to adolescents and youth; (3) in selected Regions, creation of political support at community level for the provision of SRH information and services to adolescents and youth; and (4) in selected Regions, provision of adolescent- and youth-friendly SRH information and services. The PDS sub-programme will have one output: (1) increased exposure of policy makers to SRH issues among adolescents and youth in Regions most vulnerable to HIV/AIDS infection. The achievement of these outputs will lead to changes in behaviour that place individual adolescents and youth at risk of SRH-related morbidity and mortality and will also lead to changes in the socio-cultural norms and practices that perpetuate gender inequality and inequity. In this way, the achievement of the outputs will contribute to the achievement of the purposes of the sub-programmes in terms of reducing the risky behavior and vulnerability of adolescents and youth in relation to SRH issues and to promoting greaterUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 94 of 134gender equality and equity. This, in turn, will also contribute to the achievement of the goal of the Country Programme. e) Funding for Indicative Programme The Third Country Programme will require US$3.5 million from regular resources and US$9 million from multi-bilateral and/or other resources, including regular resources. The regular resources will be distributed between the RH sub-programme (US$2.7 million), the PDS sub-programme (US$0.5 million) and Programme Co-ordination and Assistance (US$0.3 million). Given the limited level of regular resources available for a Category B country like Namibia, efforts will be made to mobilise US$8.5 million for the RH sub-programme and US$0.5 million for the PDS sub-programme from multi-bilateral resources. 3. United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) a) Global Mandate UNICEF is mandated by the United Nations General Assembly to advocate for the protection of children's rights, to help meet their basic needs and to expand their opportunities to reach their full potential. UNICEF is guided by the Convention on the Rights of the Child and strives to establish children's rights as enduring ethical principles and international standards of behaviour towards children. UNICEF insists that the survival, protection and development of children are universal development imperatives that are integral to human progress. UNICEF mobilises political will and material resources to help countries, particularly developing countries, ensure a \"first call for children\" and to build their capacity to form appropriate policies and deliver services for children and their families. UNICEF is committed to ensuring special protection for the most disadvantaged children - victims of war, disasters, extreme poverty, all forms of violence and exploitation and those with disabilities. UNICEF responds in emergencies to protect the rights of children. In Co-ordination with United Nations partners and humanitarian agencies, UNICEF makes its unique facilities for rapid response available to its partners to relieve the suffering of children and those who provide their care. UNICEF is non-partisan and its co-operation is free of discrimination. In everything it does, the most disadvantaged children and the countries in greatest need have priority.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 95 of 134UNICEF aims, through its Country Programme, to promote the equal rights of women and girls and to support their full participation in the political, social and economic development of their communities. UNICEF works with all its partners towards the attainment of the sustainable human development goals adopted by the world community and the realisation of the vision of peace and social progress enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. For more than 53 years UNICEF has been helping governments, communities and families make the world a better place for children. Part of the UN System, UNICEF has an enviable mandate and mission, to advocate for children's rights and help meet their needs. In 1996 the UNICEF Executive Board reaffirmed the mission, saying that UNICEF \"is guided by the Convention on the Rights of the Child and strives to establish children's rights as enduring ethical principles and international standards of behaviour towards children.\" UNICEF now works in 161 countries, areas and territories on solutions to the problems plaguing poor children and their families and on ways to realise their rights. Its activities are as varied as the challenges it faces, encouraging the care and stimulation that offer the best possible start in life, helping prevent childhood illness and death, making pregnancy and childbirth safe, combating discrimination and co-operating with communities to ensure that girls as well as boys attend school. UNICEF was created at the end of World War II to relieve the suffering of children in war torn Europe and it continues today to respond rapidly in crises, helping recreate a sense of stability and normalcy, reopening schools and establishing safe spaces for children when armed conflict and war, flood and other disruptions occur. In so many other ways -- supporting National Immunisation Days in the global effort to eradicate polio, encouraging young people to prepare for and participate in issues affecting them or helping them resist the onslaught of HIV/AIDS -- UNICEF is on the ground and at the fore, bringing ideas, resources, strategies and support to bear when and where they are needed most. b) Highlights of UNICEF's work in Namibia during the past 10 years UNICEF has been assisting the Namibian Government since Independence in defining priorities and programmes for children. Namibia was one of the African countries to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). Some of the stipulations of the CRC have now been anchored in Namibia's constitution. Following President Nujoma's participation at the World Summit for Children, UNICEF assisted the government in developing a National Programme of Action (NPA), adopting most of the Goals agreed at the Summit. The NPA was the first of its kind on the African Continent. The NPA was instrumental in directing resources of Ministries towards programmes and initiativesUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 96 of 134benefiting children. Most of the objectives and targets of the NPA were later included in the 1st National Development Plan (NDP1). Some of the targets were even made more ambitious. With the end of the decade, government is now in the process, with the help of UNICEF, of compiling the report on Namibia's achievements of the World Summit Goals for children. Similarly, UNICEF helped the Government to prepare its first report on CRC implementation, while the second periodic report on CRC implementation is nearing completion. UNICEF has already twice assisted government in preparing an analysis of the situation of children in women in Namibia. The first report was published in 1991, and provided directions for the first GRN - UNICEF programme of co-operation from 1992 - 1996. The second, more comprehensive, report was published in 1995 and guided the development of the second GRN-UNICEF Programme of Co-operation, 1997 - 2001. A third report, highlighting selected areas of particular concern to children and adolescents in Namibia, is currently under preparation, and will provide a basis for the 3rd GRN- UNICEF programme of co-operation. Some notable contributions to Government efforts to improve child welfare, and the realisation of children's rights, over the past 10 years include: Support to child immunisation services (Expanded Programme on Immunisation /EPI), which improved dramatically during the first years of independence, but remained stagnant, or showed a slight decrease since 1996. Support still continues, especially in Namibia's contribution to eradicate Polio, and to help Government to operationalise its strategy of Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI). EPI, together with other support to the primary health care interventions such as control of diarrhoeal diseases, management of acute respiratory infections or micronutrient deficiencies and nowadays the introduction of IMCI, typically used up a major portion of UNICEF funding support. During the first years after independence, UNICEF assisted Government in testing out so called area based approaches to development, focusing on nutrition, household food security and early childhood issues. While the programmes never went on to a large scale, they provided worthwhile lessons on the importance of the involvement of communities in development initiatives. In particular, it helped to strengthen the capacity of the Community Development Division, at that time part of the MRLGH. The Division was instrumental in developing, with UNICEF assistance, the first multi-sectoral policy on early childhood development. The policy, among others, established a National ECD Committee, which is still operational, and in which UNICEF is a member. These efforts were supplemented with capacity building at the regional council level. Omusati and Hardap regions developed regional plans of action for children, which can be considered a precursor of regional development plans that are presently being developed for all 13 regions. Not at least because of UNICEF's involvement with theUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 97 of 134Hardap council, Hardap region is often been considered a test case for decentralisation programmes. During the second half of the decade, with more clarity about critical development issues for children, and better analysis of underlying causes, UNICEF assistance was directed into more strategic areas where otherwise little other support was available. These included the strengthening of the school governance system, through the development of a model of community based training of school boards. Increased participation and oversight of parents in the management of schools is considered an important element of not only increasing the quality of education, but also the ability of communities to get organised for collective problem solving. The programme has meanwhile gone to scale, and has been supplemented by a corresponding programme to strengthen school management through better supervision through inspectors. A focus on vulnerable groups led to the creation of the inter-ministerial taskforce on education for marginalised children, in which UNICEF is a member. The task force has since reviewed and recommended various action plans, and UNICEF also assisted in the development of policy guidelines on education for marginalised groups. In the area of Early Childhood Development, UNICEF has been assisting the Government in implementing the ECD policy, and has as of recent helped to organise civil society organisations around early childcare issues and to reach out to childcare workers throughout Namibia. Vulnerable groups have also been the focus of a special protection programme that aims to create fair conditions for juvenile delinquents, and to assist victims of domestic violence and abuse. Members of the police force are being trained on the internationally accepted standards of juvenile justice, and Women and Child Protection units have been set up in major towns. With the continuing threat of the HIV/AIDS pandemic on the life of young children and adolescents, UNICEF has increasingly diverted resources to the prevention or mitigation of HIV/AIDS. The presently largest UNICEF intervention is the support to a life skills programme for adolescents, administered by peer educators and meanwhile decentralised to the regional. 61,000 young people between the age of 15 and 18 have so far gone through a 20-hour curriculum built on participation, interaction and skills transfer. The programme also aims to provide the necessary conditions for young people to practice risk reduction behaviour, and has managed to forge a multi-media national campaign on HIV/AIDS. Other UNICEF interventions include the development of programmes that use informal and formal day care centres as platforms for collective orphan care. c) UNICEF's comparative advantages appear to be: i) to generate consensus on the analysis of the situation of children and women and on the prioritisation of interventions that aim to improve child rights indicators; ii) to design and promote multi-sectoral responses when so required;United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 98 of 134iii) to operationalise strategies aimed at community mobilisation and participation; and iv) in the area of programming for and with young people. d) UNICEF within the Framework of UNDAF Based on the documented successes and failures, and considering UNICEF mandate, the situation of children in Namibia and national priorities, UNICEF Namibia will remain involved in the following areas of assistance, using a human rights approach to programming: Young children's health, care and development. Parents are the primary duty bearers for the fulfilment of young children's rights. Programmes need to strengthen the capacity i.e. knowledge and skills of parents to ensure their children stay health, and to ensure the right conditions for psychosocial development. Health services, ECD services, and civil society groups and systems need to be re-oriented to directly support families and communities to improve parenting practices. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection, and need to stay healthy to remain in charge of their own development. UNICEF will continue to be involved in supporting programmes for young people, with young people. Vulnerable groups will remain the focus of UNICEF's intervention. These include the development of protection services or policies, and to ensure that marginalised groups are not excluded from services. To achieve a reduction in the persistent disparities, a voice shall be given to particularly marginalised groups, and UNICEF may help to develop affirmative action strategies to ensure full participation of those groups in societal decision-making. All proposed areas of involvement call for community based solutions and require decentralised management structures. UNICEF will furthermore continue to advocate for child friendly policies and strategies, and protection of particularly vulnerable groups. e) Funding for Indicative Programme Data does not currently exist for the indicative programme. Past funding levels are therefore being used as an indicator of future funding needs. These stood at US$ 30 million for the cycle 1997 to 2001.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 99 of 1344. Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) a) Global Mandate The Food and Agriculture Organisation was founded in October 1945 with a mandate to raise levels of nutrition and standards of living, to improve agricultural productivity, and to better the condition of rural populations. Today, FAO is the largest autonomous agency within the United Nations system with 180 Member Nations plus the EC (Member Organisation) and more than 4 300 staff members around the world. The Organisation's 1998-1999 biennial budget is set at $650 million and FAO assisted projects attract more than $300 million per year from donor agencies and governments for investment in agricultural and rural development projects. Since its inception, FAO has worked to alleviate poverty and hunger by promoting agricultural development, improved nutrition and the pursuit of food security - the access of all people at all times to the food they need for an active and healthy life. The Organisation offers direct development assistance, collects, analyses and disseminates information, provides policy and planning advice to governments and acts as an international forum for debate on food and agriculture issues. FAO is active in land and water development, plant and animal production, forestry, fisheries, economic and social policy, investment, nutrition, food standards and commodities and trade. It also plays a major role in dealing with food and agricultural emergencies. A specific priority of the Organisation is encouraging sustainable agriculture and rural development within a long-term strategy for the conservation and management of natural resources. It aims to meet the needs of both present and future generations through programmes that do not degrade the environment and are technically appropriate, economically viable and socially acceptable. Sustainable agriculture and rural development provides an essential foundation for improving the nutrition, food security and standard of living of millions of people living in developing countries. In addition to ensuring adequate food, it creates employment and generates income through farming, processing and distribution sectors and contributes to overall national development. FAO promotes development that provides long-term solutions to the fundamental problems of poverty and hunger. In promoting sustainable agricultural development, FAO gives practical help to developing countries through a wide range of technical assistance projects. The Organisation encourages an integrated approach, with environmental, social and economic considerations included in the formulation of development projects. In some areas, for example, particular combinations of crops can improve agricultural productivity, provide a source of fuel wood for local villagers, improve soil fertility andUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 100 of 134reduce the impact of erosion. By encouraging people's participation, FAO aims to draw on local expertise and ensure a co-operative approach to development. In doing so, it brings new skills, ideas and technologies to rural communities. On average, FAO is involved in some 1,800 field projects operating at any one time. They range from integrated land management projects to policy and planning advice for governments in areas as diverse as forestry programmes and marketing strategies. The Organisation usually takes one of three roles: implementing its own programme; executing a programme on behalf of other agencies and international donors; or providing advice and management assistance to national projects. FAO's Investment Centre assists developing countries in formulating investment projects in agricultural and rural development. During 1995, FAO-assisted investment projects were worth some $3 300 million. b) Support to Namibia in the last 5 years Since 1995, 16 projects have been supported in Namibia with a total cost of US$3,590,760 (N$25,135,320) These projects include: Training for Integration of Women in Agriculture and Rural Development Development of National Agricultural Policy Strengthening of Food Control Administration Assistance in Forestry Legislation Assistance to Improve Seed Production Initiation of Agro-Ecological Zoning Procedures for Namibia Strengthening Plant Protection Capabilities and Legislation Support to the Faculty of Agriculture and Natural Resources Support to Livestock Improvement in the Northern Communal Areas of Namibia Assistance in Water Legislation Establishment of Date Packing House Preliminary Assistance for the Development of a Date Industry in Eastern and Southern Africa Harmonisation of Marine Fisheries, Policy within SADC Coastal Countries The expertise of FAO has been sought by the Government of Namibia for activities funded by GRN at an approximately cost of N$ 46,757,753. Some of these support activities include: Strengthening of Namibia Early Warning and Food Information Systems Date Production Support Programme Support to Food Security and Nutrition Programme for Namibia Institutional Support to Fisheries Management, Policy and Planning Integrated Rural Development and Food Security Support ProgrammeUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 101 of 134 Improved Pearl Millet Post Harvest Technologies for Enhanced Food Security and Rural Income Generation Training Youth for Sustainable Livelihood in Rural Namibia Sustainable development, ensuring the integration of rural women has also been an integral part of FAO's work in Namibia. FAO currently implements a Norwegian funded project \"Integrated Rural Development and Food Security Support Programme\" and the main activities over the next 2 years include efforts to integrate gender issues in all development work and the integration of Socio-Economic and Gender Analysis (SEAGA) methodologies, as necessary. Major Impact of interventions Employment creation e.g. in the fisheries sector, date production etc Capacity building, e.g. training of the faculty of agriculture and natural resources, and relevant units within line ministries Enhancement in GDP e.g. fisheries; dates Support to rural women e.g. small scale mahangu production and commercialisation Recent development of appropriate legislation/policy Forestry Legislation Water Bill Plant Protection Agricultural Policy Initiation of Agro-Industrial Policy for Namibia Initiation of Food Standard under Codex Alimentarius c) FAO within the Framework of UNDAF The main theme of the UNDAF document is Poverty Reduction. In this connection the lack of an integrated rural development policy/programme in Namibia needs to be addressed and would be one of the major areas for FAO's assistance. Support would be provided in the development of a long term vision and high level policy which comprehensively emphasises the development of the rural sector especially since there is a sharp segmentation of agriculture between the communal and the commercial sub- sectors. Agriculture development in the communal areas require a review of current policy issues and strategies. Food Security Strategy, nutrition and poverty eradication in Namibia calls for improved technologies and employment creation. Due to the serious aridity and uncertainty of rainfall in Namibia, there would also be emphasis on a comprehensive irrigation policy and shared waters management. FAO would support the GRN's effort on sustainable land use patterns and the further development of resettlement programmes. Further assistance would focus onUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 102 of 134environmental conservation, management and sustainable utilisation of the natural resource base and protection of biodiversity. d) Funding for Indicative Programme The value of assistance needed from donors, GRN and other sources is tentatively put at N$ 46,757,753 or some US$ 6.7 million at current 7:1 exchange rate to the US$. 5. World Health Organisation (WHO) a) Global Mandate The objective of WHO is the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health. Health, is defined in the WHO Constitution, is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. In support of its main objective, the Organisation has a wide range of functions, including the following: to act as the directing and co-ordinating authority on international health work; to promote technical co-operation; to assist Governments, upon request, in strengthening health services; to furnish appropriate technical assistance and, in emergencies, necessary aid, upon the request or acceptance of Governments; to stimulate and advance work on the prevention and control of epidemic, endemic and other diseases; to promote, in co-operation with other specialised Agencies where necessary, the improvement of nutrition, housing, sanitation, recreation, economic or working conditions and other aspects of environmental hygiene; to promote and co-ordinate biomedical and health services research; to promote improved standards of teaching and training in the health, medical and related professions; to establish and stimulate the establishment of international standards for biological, pharmaceutical and similar products, and to standardise diagnostic procedures; and to foster activities in the field of mental health, especially those activities affecting the harmony of human relations. WHO also proposes conventions, agreements, regulations and makes recommendations about international nomenclature of diseases, causes of death and public health practices. It develops, establishes and promotes international standards concerning foods and biological, pharmaceutical and similar substances. b) Development Co-operation in Namibia WHO's inputs in Namibia focused on health policy, sector reform, systems development, district health systems development, Human Resources Development (HRD), health care financing, immunisation, reproductive health, environmental health, etc.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 103 of 134In 1990, the first programme of technical co-operation between GRN and WHO focused on the transformation of the health system from curative into a primary health care approach. More specifically, WHO provided technical assistance and direct financial contributions to the following activities: health policy and strategy development; health sector reform; district health system development; human resources for health development; health care financing; disease prevention and control; essential drugs; epidemic response and emergency preparedness; immunisation against childhood diseases; reproductive health, including adolescent health; environmental health; and specialised services such as laboratory, mental health, rehabilitation, health legislation, blood banks, etc. Since 1996, the work of WHO has been focused on six areas in order to optimise the use of available resources and increase the impact of WHO support, namely health sector reform and district health systems (formulation of a new organisational chart for MoHSS; decentralisation of health services); HRD (fellowships primarily in public and community health specialities; support to the formulation of a national plan for HRD for MoHSS); disease prevention and control (malaria: strengthening of programme management, training of health personnel, laboratory techniques, research; HIV/AIDS: direct support to the MOHSS, particularly to policy development, programme management, analyses of trends and projections, home-based care, training, immunisable and other childhood diseases via the integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI); collaboration with other UN Agencies through the UN Theme Group strengthening of epidemiological work (training for central and regional health personnel, statistical analysis of trends and projections, preparation of epidemiological profiles); reproductive health (RH policy and strategy formulation, improvement of maternal health care, adolescent sexual and reproductive health); and health and the environment (assistance to policy development, strategy formulation, programme management, HRD).United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 104 of 134c) WHO within the Framework of UNDAF Under UNDAF, and within the framework of a revised corporate structure that will include poverty reduction as a focal area of co-operation, WHO will continue to address issues related to health sector reform and district health systems, capacity building, disease prevention and control with specific emphasis on HIV/AIDS and malaria, strengthened epidemiological work, reproductive health, and health and the environment. WHO will, under the following objectives provide direct assistance to the Ministry of Health and Social Services: Support the MOH in strengthening integrated disease surveillence in order to improve immediate notification of diseases and appropriate action Strengthen national capacity for disease prevention and control with emphasis on STIs/HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis, and childhood diseases Support the efforts towards elimination and eradication of EPI priority target diseases namely: neonatal tetanus (NNT), measles and poliomyelitis. Strengthen national capacity for prevention and control of non-communicable diseases Contribute to the decentralization of health services initiated in 1998 and the strenthening of planning and management functions of the health system Assist the MOH in the establishment of adolescent friendly health services Assist the MOH in implementation of the policy and strategy for reproductive health Strengthen the WHO Country Office to provide consistent support to the Government for the restructure and decentralization of the health sector Assist the MOH in the review of the national plan for food and nutrition to identify areas in need of intensified support Assist the MOH to complete the formulation and implementation of the health sector policy and strategy dvelopment on health and the environment Support the establishment of a Co-ordination strategy and network for national response to emergencies Support the MOH to implement the National Policy in order to improve the provision essential drugs throughout the health system Strengthen information dissemination and partnerships in Government line Ministries and with stakeholders in health d) Funding for Indicative Programme WHO has a two-year programming cycle and is currently in the middle of the 2000 through to 2001 cycle.

United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) a) Global Mandate The purpose of the Organisation is to contribute to peace and security by promoting collaboration among the nations through education, science and culture in order to further universal respect for justice, for the rule of law and for the human rights and fundamental freedoms which are affirmed for the peoples of the world, without distinction of race, sex, language or religion, by the Charter of the United Nations. To realise this purpose the Organisation will: (a) Collaborate in the work of advancing the mutual knowledge and understanding of peoples, through all means of mass communication and to that end recommend such international agreements as may be necessary to promote the free flow of ideas by word and image; (b) Give fresh impulse to popular education and to the spread of culture: By collaborating with Members, at their request, in the development of educational activities; By instituting collaboration among the nations to advance the ideal of equality of educational opportunity without regard to race, sex or any distinctions, economic or social; By suggesting educational methods best suited to prepare the children of the world for the responsibilities of freedom; (c) Maintain, increase and diffuse knowledge:United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 106 of 134 By assuring the conservation and protection of the world's inheritance of books, works of art and monuments of history and science, and recommending to the nations concerned the necessary international conventions; By encouraging co-operation among the nations in all branches of intellectual activity, including the international exchange of persons active in the fields of education, science and culture and the exchange of publications, objects of artistic and scientific interest and other materials of information; By initiating methods of international co-operation calculated to give the people of all countries access to the printed and published materials produced by any of them. With a view to preserving the independence, integrity and fruitful diversity of the cultures and educational systems of the States Members of the Organisation, the Organisation is prohibited from intervening in matters, which are essentially within their domestic jurisdiction. b) UNESCO in Namibia While at the UNESCO Windhoek Office all four components of UNESCO (Education, Natural and Social Sciences, Culture and Communication) are represented, it is important to note that the programmes on Communication as well as the Social and Human Sciences Programme have a regional orientation and are working in all 14 SADC countries while the Programmes on Education and Culture are oriented nationally. Mission The UNESCO Windhoek Office covers activities in the field of communication and social and human sciences for the Southern African Sub-region. In addition, it works on a national level in the areas of education and culture, and assists the UNESCO Pretoria Office in carrying out activities in Namibia in the area of the sciences, especially renewable energy. It co-ordinates its activities with other field offices in southern Africa: the Harare Office in the field of education, as well as the Dar-es-Salaam, Maputo and Pretoria Offices in carrying out national activities in these countries. The Office identifies, elaborates and implements all its extra-budgetary projects. In the networking and Co-ordination of activities, the UNESCO Offices in the sub-region supervise all Funds-in-Trust projects located in each host country, though the projects may be executed directly by a programme specialist who is not based in the country office. Education for All throughout Life - Mandate The right to education is a fundamental human right and has been well documented in the Constitution of UNESCO (1946), the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), The Declaration of the Right of the Child (1959), The Convention against DiscriminationUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 107 of 134in Education (1960), International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1960), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989), The World Declaration on Education for All (1990), the Namibian Constitution (1990), 5th International Conference on Adult Education (1998), and reaffirmed at the World Education Forum (2000). UNESCO's focus is to assist its Member State in developing education programmes relevant to the needs of the country and its people. Activities in education , which are geared towards reaching the objective of Education for all throughout life , are based on the four pillars of education namely; learning to be, learning to know, learning to do and learning to live together , which is also the focus of the Organisation's Major Programme I. Emphasis in education is being placed on improving the status of teachers, contributing to curriculum reform and capacity building in the production of basic learning materials, literacy and adult education, and special needs and inclusive education as well as in the promotion of scientific, technical and vocational education, particularly for girls and women. Poverty and Inequality Reduction as well as Economic Growth - Mandate The focus of the Social and Human Sciences Programme is to contribute to developing social science research and policy making in priority areas of development and social transformation as highlighted at the major international conferences held during the last few years. A particular emphasis is on strategies for eradicating poverty and combating social exclusion and violence, management of multicultural societies and urban settlements, and gender mainstreaming. In particular, issues related to Poverty, Inequality Reduction and Economic Growth, as well as to Gender Issues and Human Rights, are addressed within UNESCO's Social and Human Sciences Programme and by the Programme on Education. Gender Issues and Human Rights - Mandate As indicated earlier on, the original idea that guides the work of UNESCO is the idea of peace, which is something more than the mere absence of declared hostilities--peace involving solidarity, concord and a concerted effort by free men and women to achieve security and happiness. The aim is to make war impossible by instituting truly human relations among all people of the world and to vanquish its causes through the social, material and moral progress of mankind. In addition to its strategies related to poverty alleviation and gender mainstreaming, a special emphasis of UNESCO's Social and Human Sciences Programme is on the promotion of human rights, democracy, peace and tolerance. Towards a Communication and Information Society for All - Mandate Article I of UNESCO's Constitution assigns to the Organisation the task of promoting the \"free flow of ideas by word and image.\" Since the adoption in 1989, of a newUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 108 of 134communication strategy reaffirming this standing commitment to freedom of expression and freedom of information, UNESCO has played a prominent role in this field recognised not only by governments but also by major non-governmental media organisations. This major programme is composed of two programmes corresponding to the twofold mandate of the Organisation in this area: to promote the free flow of ideas and \"universal access\" to information, and to strengthen communication capacities in Member States with a view to enable all nations and communities to participate in the world communication process. Since its inception in 1991, the Communication, Information and Informatics Sector (CII) of the UNESCO Windhoek Office has been executing numerous projects entrusted by the philosophy described above in the Southern African Sub-Region. In the spirit of the 1999 Windhoek Declaration, which advocates press freedom and media pluralism, the Windhoek Office is supporting the country's sole broadcaster under the Human Resource Development Programme for the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation, providing both technical and financial assistance for the implementation of various training projects. UNESCO is also instrumental in the implementation of the UN Pilot Poverty Alleviation Programme, under which the Eenhana Multimedia Centre with a community radio station is being operated to facilitate the mobilisation of the community. UNESCO has been playing an active role in tackling issues of HIV/AIDS under the UN Theme Group on HIV/AIDS. The Technical Working Group specialising in Communication, Youth and Education, to which UNESCO is mainly contributing, has hitherto achieved significant results in sensitising Namibian media practitioners to issues HIV/AIDS, analysing existing policies and resources, and incorporating various sectors to set up the Namibian Media Task Force on HIV/AIDS. c) UNESCO within the Framework of UNDAF Within the framework of UNDAF, UNESCO will continue to advocate the attainment of the targets set by global Conventions. At the project level, UNESCO will, with due regard of its mandates, comparative advantages and resource base and whenever possible and feasible, assist in enhancing current and planned activities of the UN System in Namibia. In view of the challenges facing education in Namibia, and the constraints faced by the GRN in attaining the overall objectives of Jomtien on providing quality basic education for all, UNESCO will focus attention on the following areas: reviewing and harmonising existing policies and legislation in education, including education for human rights and democracy, to ensure the provision of basic education for all; capacity building to focus in areas of teacher education, information management systems, monitoring, evaluation and school management and leadership;United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 109 of 134 capacity building in the area of curriculum reform taking into account new information communication technologies; capacity building in the production and provision of basic learning materials; support the provision of inclusive education for people living with disabilities; contribute to assessing and re-asses pre-and in-service teacher training programmes and enhance the status of teachers; and strengthening partnership with NGOs and community participation in the education and reform. Under UNDAF, UNESCO will continue to contribute to poverty and inequality reduction and economic growth by supporting community development, and regional and development projects as well as specific activities for and with marginalised groups. UNESCO will contribute to the development of rural communities and to support the empowerment of marginalised groups, particularly women, youth, the elderly, San and Topnaar people through research, advocacy and specific target-group oriented activities. The perception of the role of the Social and Human Sciences Programme is to contribute to research on poverty related issues as well as to planning, implementing and monitoring of activities that follow an integrated and gender-oriented approach and target the most needy. UNESCO will continue contributing to the Ohangwena Pilot Poverty Reduction Programme. In addition, UNESCO intends to be included in the National Task Force on Poverty Reduction (NTFPR). As far as target-group specific activities are concerned, it is envisaged to get involved in the following areas: strengthening participatory community development planning capacities; providing technical assistance to the preparation and implementing of regional development plans; providing technical assistance to leadership training for youth; and providing technical assistance for participatory gender-differentiated planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of activities addressing the reduction of poverty and inequality. UNESCO will continue working in the area of promoting tolerance, human rights, peace and democracy in the country.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 110 of 134UNESCO will to promoting human rights and gender issues by continuing working closely with scholars and researchers at the UNAM, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Women Affairs and Child Welfare and other concerned GRN and non-governmental entities. UNESCO will continue to include Namibia in sub-regional and regional activities in the areas of research and teaching of human rights, gender issues and democracy. As far as the provision of technical assistance is concerned, it is envisaged to get involved in training for victim-supportive sexual offences courts and in human rights training for the police and the defence force. With regard to communication, the focal areas of activities during the next biennium 2000-2001 are as follows: promoting independent and pluralistic media; enhancing educational and cultural mission of public service broadcasting; encouraging women in the media to participate in the decision making process; highlighting and reinforcing the role of communication and information in addressing social issues (e.g. poverty alleviation, HIV/AIDS, human rights, democratic governance and social integration, etc.) and priority groups (youth and women); providing a forum for reflection and debate to increase access to information, promote cultural diversity and multilingualism in cyber-space, and to reduce violence on the screen or informatics-related crimes such as pedophilia on the Internet; building capacities of endogenous audiovisual production; providing training opportunities for information and informatics specialists; and enhancing the role of librarians and archives as gateways to information highways. d) Funding for Indicative Programme Not available.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 111 of 1347. Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) a) Global Mandate As the main advocate for global action on HIV/AIDS, UNAIDS leads, strengthens and supports an expanded response aimed at preventing the transmission of HIV, providing care and support, reducing the vulnerability of individuals and communities to HIV/AIDS, and alleviating the impact of the epidemic. As the leading advocate for world wide action against HIV/AIDS, the global mission of UNAIDS is to lead, strengthen and support an expanded response to the epidemic that will: prevent the spread of HIV provide care and support for those infected and affected by the disease reduce the vulnerability of individuals and communities to HIV/AIDS alleviate the socio-economic and human impact of the epidemic. From 1986, the World Health Organisation (WHO) had the lead responsibility on AIDS in the United Nations, helping countries to set up much-needed national AIDS programmes. But by the mid-1990s, it became clear that the relentless spread of HIV, and the epidemic's devastating impact on all aspects of human lives and on social and economic development, were creating an emergency that would require a greatly expanded United Nations effort. Nor could any single United Nations organisation provide the co-ordinated level of assistance needed to address the many factors driving the HIV epidemic, or help countries deal with the impact of HIV/AIDS on households, communities and local economies. Greater Co-ordination would be needed to maximise the impact of UN efforts. Addressing these challenges head-on, the United Nations took an innovative approach in 1996, drawing six organisations together in a joint and cosponsored programme - the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). The six original Cosponsors of UNAIDS - UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA, UNESCO, WHO and the World Bank - were joined in April 1999 by UNDCP. The goal of UNAIDS is to catalyse, strengthen and orchestrate the unique expertise, resources, and networks of influence that each of these organisations offers. Working together through UNAIDS, the Cosponsors expand their outreach through strategic alliances with other United Nations Agencies, national governments, corporations, media, religious organisations, community-based groups, regional and country networks of people living with HIV/AIDS, and other NGOs. b) The Mechanisms of UNAIDS With an annual budget of US$ 60 million and a staff of 129 professionals, UNAIDS is a modest-sized programme with a substantial impact. The UNAIDS Secretariat operates asUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 112 of 134a catalyst and coordinator of action on AIDS, rather than as a direct funding or implementing agency. The largest donors to UNAIDS in 1998 were the United States Government, which contributed US$ 15 million, followed by the Governments of the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. UNAIDS also receives funds from non- traditional donors such as China, Thailand and South Africa. UNAIDS is guided by a Programme Coordinating Board with representatives of 22 governments from all parts of the world, representatives of the 7 UNAIDS Cosponsors, and 5 representatives of non-governmental organisations (NGOs), including associations of people living with HIV/AIDS.UNAIDS is the first United Nations programme to include NGOs in its governing body. The Cosponsors and Secretariat also meet several times a year as the Committee of Cosponsoring Organisations (CCO). The Secretariat of UNAIDS is based in Geneva, Switzerland. Current priority areas for the Secretariat include: young people highly vulnerable populations prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission developing and implementing community standards of AIDS care vaccine development special initiatives for hard-hit regions, including sub-Saharan Africa. c) UNAIDS at country level In developing countries, UNAIDS operates mainly through the country-based staff of its seven Cosponsors. Meeting as the host country's United Nations Theme Group on HIV/AIDS, representatives of the Cosponsoring organisations share information, plan and monitor co-ordinated action between themselves and with other partners, and decide on joint financing of major AIDS activities in support of the country's government and other national partners. The principal objective of the Theme Group is to support the host country's efforts to mount an effective and comprehensive response to HIV/AIDS. In most cases, the host government is invited to be part of the Theme Group. Increasingly, other partners such as representatives of other UN Agencies and bilateral organisations working in the country are also included. In priority countries the Theme Group has the support of a UNAIDS staff member, called a Country Programme Adviser (CPA). Elsewhere, a staff member of one of the seven Cosponsors serves as the UNAIDS focal point for the country. In addition to supporting the UN System, these staff endeavour to build national commitment to AIDS action and provide information and guidance to a range of host country partners, including government departments and groups and organisations from civil society, such as people living with HIV/AIDS.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 113 of 134The UNAIDS Secretariat makes catalytic funding available for selected AIDS initiatives. Between January 1998 and May 1999, proposals were received and approved for projects in a total of 87 countries. As of April 1999, the UNAIDS Cosponsors had established 132 United Nations Theme Groups on HIV/AIDS covering 155 countries. For their day-to-day operations, most Theme Groups have set up special working groups that involve donors, NGOs and groups of people living with HIV/AIDS. d) UNAIDS within the Framework of UNDAF Under UNDAF, UNAIDS will continue to render assistance with a particular focus on the priority areas identified by the Secretariat of UNAIDS, within the national strategic plan on the prevention of HIV/AIDS. The current priority areas for the Secretariat include young people, highly vulnerable populations, prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, developing and implementing community standards of AIDS care and vaccine development. In Namibia, taking note of the current opportunities such as the Medium Term Plan II, the growing level of political commitment, the commitment of key sectors like the NPCS to include the issue of HIV/AIDS in NDP2, the UN will continue to support the national response to contain the spread of HIV/AIDS. Taking the challenges mentioned above in combating the alarmingly spreading epidemic into consideration, the broad areas of the UN support to the national response on HIV/AIDS are mentioned as follows: In the area of Prevention efforts with emphasis on the Youth - providing support in the Development and implementation of Communication activities to prevent sexual transmission through the reduction of individual risk behaviour. In the area of Social Mobilisation - to create continuous awareness through established dialogue within and between communities, to continuously advocate for a sustained GRN commitment in the fight against AIDS, to identify policy gaps for advocacy messages and existing policy information for mass media dissemination etc. In the area of Impact Reduction - with the objective of raising awareness of discriminatory practices towards those infected and affected, combat violence against women and children, support activities on gender and human rights, enhance the provision of victim friendly low enforcement services in relation to sexual offences etc. In the area of Provision of Access to Services - To strengthen and expand counselling and other psychological support services, to strengthen and expand testing services, to improve case management of STD's, HIV Disease and AIDS, to improve and expand home based care, support groups and other support services for people living with and affected by HIV/Aids, and to ensure an adequate care and support structure for children affected by HIV and AIDS, including orphans. Program Management and Development - To support the creation of national and regional management structures, assist in building capacity in management, monitoring and evaluation at all levels.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 114 of 134Based on the broad areas of support, specific activities will be developed and implemented by UN Agencies depending on its comparative advantages and mandates. Areas for joint support by two or more agencies will also be identified. Opportunities of bringing in more partners from the Government, the NGOs, the Private Sector, PLHAs etc. will be expanded and strengthened, too. 8. United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) The UNHCR is, on invitation of GRN, assisting in seeking durable solutions for the refugee problem in Namibia. Durable solution composes: repatriation to country of origin, local settlement in host country (Namibia), and resettlement into a third country. At present, UNHCR is mainly focusing on local settlement since, repatriation, the preferred durable solution option in any refugee situation is not feasible, because of the prolonged war situation in the refugee producing countries, such as, Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo. There are now an estimated 23531 refugees in Namibia, the majority of them (95%) are Angolans. Approximately 13531 of these are registered refugees at the Osire Refugee Camp, to whom UNHCR is providing care and maintenance assistance in the sectors: Health, Water, Sanitation, Education and Income Generation activities. Care and maintenance assistance to the camp refugees, which started since inception of the camp in 1992, will continue through year 2001 and beyond. The remaining approximately 10000 refugees, are those who have spontaneously settled in, especially, the Northern border regions of Namibia and main urban centres such as Windhoek, Walvis Bay, Otjiwarogo and Okahandja, to name a few. UNHCR is providing protection and counselling to especially those refugees in urban centres. Prolonged armed conflict in some of the countries (Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo) within the SADC Region, continues to function as a push factor for refugees into Namibia and thereby putting an extra burden on the Social-Economic infrastructure of the country. In addition to the assistance provided by UNHCR, the GRN is also using its own means to cover, health, education administrative and logistic needs of the registered camp refugees. For instance, GRN provides clinic staff and medicines to the Osire refugee clinic. In addition, school materials and the salaries of ten of the twenty-seven primary school teachers are paid for, by GRN thereby guaranteeing education to the estimated 2000 primary school learners in the camp. One of the forums on which to address the root causes of regional armed conflicts, resulting in influx of refugees into neighbouring countries is the SADC. The UNHCR has made a modest attempt into that direction during the recently held summit of Heads of State or Government of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), in Windhoek, Namibia, by presenting a paper on \"THE HUMAN COST OF WARS AND CONFLICTS IN THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY - BEYOND THE STATISTICS\".United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 115 of 134In the meantime, UNHCR will continue to work closely with GRN in formulating both Emergency Preparedness Plans for large influx of refugees, and Care and Maintenance Programme for camp refugees. a) UNHCR within the Framework of UNDAF Under UNDAF, UNHCR will continue to: utilise international and regional forums to address the root causes of regional armed conflicts; and assist GRN in formulating both emergency preparedness plans for large influx of refugees, and care and maintenance programmes for camp refugees. b) Funding for Indicative Programme Not available. 9. The Environment The UN System in Namibia will assist GRN and other stakeholders to integrate environmental concerns in its policies in order to ensure sustainability. It will help GRN to build awareness on sustainability at all levels of society. The UN System will also support GRN's efforts to fulfil its obligations under the various international conventions to which Namibia is a signatory, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Convention on Climate Change, the Convention to Combat Desertification and the forthcoming Convention on Persistent Obsolete Pesticides.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 116 of 134ANNEX 2 - Present and Prospective Donor Assistance A. European Union Co-operation between Namibia and the EU has been guided, for the past 10 years, by the Lom\u00e9 VI Convention (1991 to 2000), to which Namibia acceded in December 1990, becoming the 69th ACP member state. Before the 4th Lom\u00e9 Convention resources became available to Namibia, the EU provided approximately EURO 33 million as a transitional measure during 1990 and 1991. The assistance was largely provided in the form of targeted budgetary assistance in order to compensate, in part, for the financial allocation of some N$ 600 million which Namibia received from the South African Government annually. The Lom\u00e9 IV co-operation period of 10 years is divided into two 5-year periods, each with its own financial protocol (European Development Fund [EDF] 7 and 8) and its own National Indicative Programme. Under the first financial protocol, EURO 45 million was made available in the form of grants. In response to Namibia's absorptive capacity and general developmental performance, this amount was increased by EURO 5 million in September 1995. In addition, several other instruments became accessible to the Namibian Government and the private sector (e.g. SYSMIN for which EURO 40 million has been made available; EURO 6 million as risk capital managed by the EIB, SADC Regional Funds mainly for infrastructural projects such as the Trans Caprivi Highway). The development co-operation under the first financial protocol (EDF 7; 1991-95) concentrated on agriculture and rural development (40% of the total allocation) health (30%), education and human resources development (20%), and other (10%, trade, tourism, technical and cultural co-operation, etc.). In October 1996, a new co-operation framework, for which EURO 52 million was made available, was signed between the Namibian Government and the EU (EDF 8, 1996- 2000). A major change in emphasis of development co-operation has been negotiated between the two partners and the productive sectors have been granted high priority in favour of the health sector, namely education (28%), agriculture and rural development (28%), productive sectors (28%), and others (16%, sewerage systems, technical assistance to the NPCS, etc.). As of June 2000, the Lom\u00e9 Convention has been replaced by the Cotonou Convention (officially referred to as the New ACP-EU Partnership Agreement), which will provideUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 117 of 134the general framework for co-operation between the EU and the ACP states for the period 2000 to 2020. The EU will provide EURO 15.2 billion for its development co-operation programmes with the ACP countries. In addition, unspent funds from previous Conventions will be available for 7 years (until 2007). As far as development co-operation issues are concerned, the new Convention entails a number of distinct and innovative changes with regard to the Lom\u00e9 Convention, some of which include the following: the central objective of ACP-EU co-operation is poverty reduction, sustainable development and progressive integration of the ACP countries into the world economy, cross-cutting themes include gender issues, environmental concerns and institutional development and capacity building, key subjects for a political dialogue include the promotion of human rights, the process of democratisation, consolidation of the rule of law, and good governance, financial country allocations will be based on performance, a rolling programming system will be introduced, based on a rolling 5-year horizon, EU co-operation will be concentrated on one sector only (at the most two) and a sector-based approach will replace the current project approach, rationalisation of the instruments of co-operation (Stabex and Sysmin as separate instruments have been brought to an end), an investment facility has been introduced to enhance private sector development, the concept of partnership has been extended to decentralised actors, including policy dialogue and programme implementation, the focal sector will be identified in co-operation with the recipient government and in close Co-ordination with EU member states, and opportunities on complementarities will be identified and pursued with decentralised actors (UN Agencies, social and economic stakeholders), based on a comparative advantage approach. The EU is currently preparing the Country Support Strategy in close co-operation with Government and the external funding agencies. Once in place (by June 2001), Namibia will have access to two EDF instruments, namely the long-term development envelope, consisting of two components, namely the \"base case\" element, i.e. funds required to cover activities in the focal area of co- operation, and the \"high case\" element, which will cover unforeseen needs (loss of export earnings, emergency assistance, etc.) but which can also be used to provide additional financial means to well-performing countries that have exhausted their \"base case\" allocation, and the investment facility, which will operate as a revolving fund under the management of the EIB.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 118 of 134Of particular concern to the UNDAF process are the EU funded activities in the health sector and the Micro Project Scheme provided for under the agricultural sector support. The Micro Project Scheme will be operational by the end of 2000 to cover the northern regions. In its second year, the Scheme will also cover the southern part of Namibia. In addition, the specifically stated objective to include non-state actors in programme design and execution introduces opportunities for UN involvement. 1. Health The Namibia Integrated Health Programme, which started in 1993 under EDF 7 with an allocation of EURO 13 million, had four main objectives, namely to promote comprehensive development at the national level of the MoHSS, especially the administrative and financial services, to support the process of decentralisation, to support the development of an Essential Drugs Programme, and to develop a HRD plan for the MoHSS. As far as HIV/AIDS is concerned, the NIHP took cognisance of MTP-1 and MTP-2 and all the necessary development activities needed to achieve the above-mentioned objectives formed an integral part of the two medium-term plans. As of March 1995, EU support for STD/AIDS were financed from regional funds for an amount of EURO 450,000. This support was augmented in 1998 with a further EURO 200,000 from regional resources. Despite the fact that the NIP under the 8th EDF does not provide for support to the health sector, it has been agreed that once the NIHP is concluded (towards the end of 2000) with funds provided for under the 7th EDF, the HIV/AIDS related activities would continue. Through the AIDS programme, the EU supports the Namibia National AIDS Control Programme by way of providing funds and technical assistance. The main objectives of the support are to improve clinical management of education of STD patients, to promote safer sexual behaviour amongst STD patients, to develop guidelines for the clinical management of HIV, to provide support for surveillance of STD and HIV/AIDS, to assist in maintaining blood transfusion security, and to assist the National AIDS Co-ordination Programme (NACOP) in the effective and efficient functioning of the programme management. A proposal for additional assistance, to the value of EURO 1.5 million and to be funded under the 8th EDF, has recently been approved in Brussels.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 119 of 134The project aims to: improve the skills of health workers to treat and educate STD patients and to clinically manage HIV related diseases, and improve the health-care seeking behaviour of persons with STD and HIV/AIDS and to promote safer sexual behaviour of the population groups targeted by the project (all partners involved in STD and HIV/AIDS education and care). The EU supports donor collaboration and Co-ordination. Project information is widely shared and materials produced by different Agencies are jointly used, e.g. materials on STD produced by the EU are used by education programmes for schools of UNICEF and the Catholic AIDS Action, as well as by programmes for road and mine workers supported by SIDA and the Chamber of Mines. 2. Micro-Project Scheme The Micro-Project Scheme, with an initial allocation of EURO 4 million, is directly aimed at poverty reduction by supporting communities in rural areas. Support will be rendered to the construction or rehabilitation of essential social and rural infrastructure, and to income-generating activities. The programme also aims at assisting to redress past imbalances and reduce disparities in income. Conditions for eligibility include community ownership, 25% of project requirements must be provided for by the community in cash or in kind and a minimum of 25% of all approved projects must be women-specific. The Scheme also provides for co-financing with other institutions. The Micro-Project Scheme offers an opportunity for UN-EU co-operation as far as rural poverty alleviation activities are concerned. UN Agencies could assist communities and women groups in identifying suitable projects that would not only better their standard of living but which could also enhance the effectiveness of the UN intervention. 3. Regional Funds Under the 8th EDF, the EU provided EURO 121 million to SADC countries under the Regional Indicative Programme. Funds are provided for infrastructure projects, trade development, food security, HRD and other activities. In order to access funding under the RIP, two SADC member states have to agree on a joint project activity. As far as HIV/AIDS prevention initiatives are concerned, the potential of accessing assistance for a cross-border initiative could be explored with the responsible Namibian counterpart. B. Federal Republic of Germany Development co-operation with Germany rests on five criteria, namely respect for human rights, popular political participation, rule of law and an independent judiciary,United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 120 of 134 a market and social oriented economic regime, and development-oriented government policies. As far as the German Government is concerned, Namibia meets the above criteria, and partly because of its colonial heritage, Germany remains Namibia's most important bilateral development partner. Namibians receive more German aid per capita than any other developing country. Even though there are indications that Namibia will remain a focal point for German development assistance, policy guidelines have been issued to reduce the number of sectors of bilateral co-operation to a maximum of three. Discussions with the Namibian Government on the matter will be held during the annual negotiations (October/November 2000). The Namibian-German development co-operation arrangement provides for technical assistance ,which is always rendered on a grant basis, and financial co-operation, which is always delivered as concessionary loans (except for financial means provided for a Study and Expert Fund), but which could be converted into a grant if a project is proven to be of a social nature. Due to its status of middle-income country, Namibia might soon lose its eligibility to receive financial assistance on a grant basis. 1. Technical Co-operation Since Independence, the GTZ, on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Economic Co- operation and Development, supported technical co-operation projects in Namibia. Other institutions include the BGR (groundwater and Mineral exploration), the DED (health care, community development, forestry, vocational training), German political foundations (concentrating on issues related to social and political empowerment) and CIM (providing \"integrated\" experts). Between 1990 and 1999, the German Government provided close to DM 190 million to its technical assistance programme in Namibia. Under the technical assistance programme, the following assistance has been rendered: advisory service to the Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources, marine environmental monitoring, sustainable animal and range development, national programme to combat desertification, HRD for agriculture and natural resource management, promotion of renewable energy, protection of biodiversity, communal areas water supply, sewerage-water-awareness management, basic education project in Rundu,United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 121 of 134 support to vocational training and small scale industries, small enterprise promotion, legal capacity building, and AIDS control. Of importance to the UNDAF process would be those technical assistance programmes that focus on small enterprise promotion, on legal capacity building and on HIV/AIDS prevention. a) Small Enterprise Promotion The main objectives of the German SME programme, executed within the framework of Namibia's \"Policy and Programme on Small Enterprise Promotion\", can be summarised as follows: strengthening the Ministry of Trade and Industry's (MTI) concept for managing and supervising the SME policy and its programmes, assess the needs of micro and small-scale entrepreneurs for support services, establish an independent Credit Guarantee Fund, and formulate approaches for improving training and advisory services for SMEs. b) Legal Capacity Building Programme The programme supports the Ministry of Justice with the following components: support to the Law Reform and Development Commission and to the Ministry of Justice for law reform matters and the administration of justice, establishment of a legal database system, and support for the Office of the Attorney General. The support to the Law Reform and Development Commission resulted in the Married Persons Equality Act of 1996 and the drafting of child maintenance and rape legislation. In addition, workshops on violence against women and children were conducted in all regions of Namibia. The above areas are of particular importance to the UN's general mandate on human rights, including gender concerns and children, and the process of having a Bill passed into an Act could being accelerated (child maintenance). c) AIDS Control Project The project, directed towards the strengthening of the national and regional capacity to respond more adequately to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, has the following objectives: promotion of safer sex through condom use and adequate IEC strategies, control of sexually transmitted diseases through syndromic approach management and operational research, strengthening of management capacity,United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 122 of 134 generation of epidemiological information, development of structures for the care of people with HIV-infections and AIDS, and involvement of other sectors in the response to HIV/AIDS. 2. Financial Co-operation Financial Co-operation, implemented by the Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW), concentrated on the development of the northern parts of Namibia and projects such as water supply, rural telecommunication, rural roads, primary schools and low-cost housing were supported on a grant basis. Germany also financed a social marketing project on condoms. Other projects, such as support to the construction of the Trans-Caprivi Highway, road rehabilitation between Oshivelo and Oshakati, the upgrading of the port of Walvis Bay, etc., are financed on a concessionary loan basis. The support to labour-intensive construction methods, wherever possible and especially with regard to rural roads, in order to counteract high employment deserves special attention. Experiences gained and lessons learned could be institutionalised to facilitate replication. C. Sweden The overall goal of Swedish development co-operation is to raise the standard of living of the poor. In order to achieve this overall goal, the following objectives were adopted: economic growth, economic and political independence, economic and social equality, democratic development in society, long-term sustainable management of natural resources and the protection of the environment, and equality between men and women. Swedish bilateral development co-operation is executed by SIDA, who is tasked to create conditions conducive to change and to socially, economically and environmentally sustainable development. The 1999 country frame for Namibia was set at SEK 65 million. Support is extended to the sectors of basic and adult education, transport and communication, and public administration. To a lesser degree, Sweden supports activities in the fields of water and environment, democracy and human rights, private sector development, and AIDS.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 123 of 1341. Current Co-operation Relevant to UNDAF a) HIV/AIDS The aim of Swedish support is to contribute to the prevention of the spread of HIV/AIDS with special emphasis on the youth. SIDA started co-operation in the sector in 1993 by rendering support to the National Aids Control Programme by assisting in the production and dissemination of information and educational material. The project ended in 1995 and a total of SEK 1.7 million was disbursed. During the period 1997 to 2000, SIDA supports the Youth Health Development Programme as implemented by UNICEF with an amount of SEK 7.7 million. The focus of the programme is aimed at a life skills training curriculum that addresses issues such as the prevention of HIV/AIDS, teenage pregnancy and alcohol abuse among the youth. Through UNAIDS and UNICEF, SIDA also supports (until 2001) a project aimed at expanding young people's access to HIV/AIDS prevention services. The programme focuses on the promotion of an enabling environment for the youth to engage in responsible behaviour, the promotion of a \"youth friendly\" health service, the assurance of the availability and accessibility of condoms, and the provision of technical support to various national partners in condom promotion and distribution. Within its sectoral support programme, and in line with the policy guidelines of MTP-2, SIDA is supporting an AIDS campaign in the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communication. b) Education The overall objective of Sweden's education sector programme is to support the efforts to reform and develop the educational system in Namibia. Special emphasis is put on basic education for children and adults. SIDA supports the following activities with a total 1995 to 1999 budget of SEK 149.5 million: teacher education reform, integration of environmental education in formal education, development of special teacher training for marginalised communities, teacher competency in Namibian languages, development and implementation of the National Literacy Programme,United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 124 of 134 construction of primary schools through the PAMWE Self-Help School Construction Programme, construction of primary schools in urban areas, and support to capacity building within the Ministry of Basic Education, Sport and Culture. c) Sustainable Use of Natural Resources The major objective of co-operation in the sector of natural resources is to increase environmental awareness, particularly with regard to water. In order to achieve the objective, the following activities were supported: development and dissemination of environmental information material, research studies on ephemeral rivers in north-western Namibia, national resource accounting, and various training activities in conjunction with the Desert Research Foundation of Namibia. d) Democracy and Human Rights The objectives of the support to Democracy and Human Rights are to strengthen civil society, participatory democracy, democratic institutions and procedures, a free and independent media and to create awareness in respect of human rights, especially with regard to women and children. Some SEK 2 to 4 million has been granted annually for activities within the sector. In order to achieve the objectives, support to the following activities has been extended: the Legal Assistance Centre, research on customary law and traditional authority, follow-up on the Women's Conference held in Beijing, the Namibia Institute for Democracy, voter education and election monitoring, and support to various human rights activities. e) Institutional Development The objective of public sector co-operation is to assist in the development of key public institutions to a level where they become competent to fulfil their legislated mandate. Institutions that received support included the Bank of Namibia and the Central Bureau of Statistics. The Office of the Auditor is still being supported. In addition, SIDA is supporting the economic management programme for the benefit of officials from the Ministry of Finance, the National Planning Commission Secretariat, the Bank of Namibia and UNAM.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 125 of 134f) Private Sector Development The objective of the programme is to intensify trade and investment between Namibia and Sweden in order to accelerate economic growth. Sweden is supporting a quality infrastructure project incorporation with the Ministry of Trade and Industry. In addition Sweden supports community based tourism. g) Transport and Communication Co-operation in the transport sector is guided by three main objectives, namely: to contribute to increase efficiency through commercialisation and private sector participation, to contribute to the construction of road infrastructure in previously neglected areas, and to create job opportunities through the development and use of labour-based methods. Programme activities resulted in the establishment of the Road Fund Administration, the Roads Authority, the Roads Contractor Company, the Airport Company, the Civil Aviation Authority, the Namibia Ports Authority, Telecom Namibia and NamPost. In addition, SIDA provides assistance to the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communication in the form of HRD programmes, bursaries, studies within the National Transportation Master Plan and legal assistance. 2. Future Co-operation As regards the future of development assistance to Namibia, both Governments have agreed to gradually reduce the level of involvement and to introduce sector wide service delivery in favour of project or programme support. Co-operation between Sweden and Namibia is guided by a Country Strategy (January 1999 to December 2001), which has as its overall objective the promotion of a lasting improvement in the living conditions of the country's poor, and the promotion of democratic development and respect for human rights. In order to achieve these objectives, the Country Programme will continue to be directed at poverty reduction through support to the educational, public administration and transport sectors. Support will also be given to initiatives within the fields of human rights (media, gender, women) and private sector development. Support to measures to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS and to the promotion of gender equality is considered. It is expected that the country frame allocation during the period covered by the Country Strategy will remain at SEK 65 million.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 126 of 134Sweden's future support to the sectors identified in the Country Strategy is summarised below. a) Education The current agreement on support to basic education will be concluded during 2000. However, Support to education will remain the main component of development co- operation. The co-operation will focus on areas that strengthen quality, increased efficiency in the utilisation of resources, and on the realisation of a more equitable education system. During the implementation phase (until 2003), SIDA will attempt to introduce a system of non-earmarked sector support. Furthermore, Sweden's future support to the education sector will be guided by NDP2. b) Institutional Development Support to the Namibian public administration is aimed at strengthening democracy and at improving the management of public funds. Co-operation with the Ministry of Finance (review system of taxation) and the NPCS (formulation of development co-operation policies, guidelines for obtaining external assistance, procedures for international agreements) are under consideration. In addition, support for further commercialisation and privatisation is considered. c) Transport and Communication Support to the transport sector is aimed at supporting economic development through reduced transport costs, increased employment and reduced pressure on national financial resources. In future, support will focus on structural changes, capacity building and increased efficiency within the sector. In addition, the development of labour-intensive methods for road construction and maintenance and other public works will be supported. During the period 2000-2002, SIDA will assist in further strengthening the restructured Department of Transport and its entities. SIDA's experience gained through the support to the development of labour-based methods in the construction of roads will culminate in the establishment of a Labour- Based Forum, an NGO-constellation aiming at the dissemination of labour-based methods within other sectors (e.g. irrigation and housing schemes). d) Private Sector Support Support to the private sector might include Co-operation with the chambers of commerce and the development of community-based tourism.. Continued co-operation on quality issues, standardisation, accreditation and certification will continue. In addition, SIDA will actively promote Swedish investments in Namibia.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 127 of 134e) Sustainable Use of Natural Resources During the period 1999-2001, environmental co-operation will be expanded with a budget of SEK 18.9 million to cover activities such as: water awareness, natural resource accounting, environmental economics, conservancy development, community based tourism development, water demand management, etc. f) Human Rights and Democracy Co-operation in the area of human rights and democracy will focus on strengthening the culture of democracy, on promoting equality between women and men, on ethnic minorities, on children, and on the strengthening of the judicial system. However, activities to be supported will be identified during 2000 by way of a study on a long-term support strategy. g) HIV/AIDS Support to contain the spread of HIV/AIDS will continue. Measures will be implemented in close co-operation with the Namibian Government and other donors, particularly UNAIDS, UNICEF and UNFPA. A two-year extension of SIDA support to the Youth Health Development Programme to the value of SEK 6 million is under preparation. A target has been set to inform and educate 80% of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 years during the implementation of the initiative. SIDA supports the Namibia Network of AIDS Service Organisations (NANASO) in consolidating its infrastructure and in formalising its mode of operations as umbrella organisation for NGOs dealing with HIV/AIDS prevention. A small grant fund to support locally developed HIV/AIDS prevention initiatives is planned to be operational in 2001. D. The Netherlands The Netherlands supported the Namibian development process since Independence with direct budgetary assistance, with technical and financial assistance in the water (rural water supply, community water management, decision makers guide to water) and education (housing for teachers, physical educational infrastructure, support to the National Literacy Programme) sectors. Assistance had been extended to the environmental sector in the form of environmental profiles of the 4-O Regions, and to the Office of the Surveyor-General to strengthen the Office's capacity in land measurement and land-use planning. The Netherlands, together with the EU, has been supportive to the plight of ex-combatants by extending technical assistance and in creating training and employment opportunities under a Social Integration Programme for Ex-combatants through a construction programme of sanitary facilities for schools in northern Namibia.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 128 of 134The Netherlands also supports a capacity building programme for gender training at UNAM (to end in 2002). As of 2000, the Netherlands's current programmes would continue until their completion and the new umbrella of co-operation with Namibia would fall within the sector of good governance. This decision is in line with an international restructuring exercise of Dutch development assistance. The Netherlands' support to Namibia amounted to approximately NLG 40 million annually. Under the new arrangement, this figure will decrease to NLG 2 million. The Netherlands policy on good governance insists on the transparent, responsible and effective use of power and resources by the government in dialogue with its people. The policy is based on four principles, namely participatory governance, transparent governance, rule of law, and effectiveness. The alleviation of poverty provides for the overarching principle. During July of 2000, an advisory mission from the Netherlands identified six general focal areas for future development co-operation assistance, in the form of capacity building, with Namibia, namely legislature, legal process, public sector, oversight institutions, media, and civil society. The criteria that guided the mission's range of priority areas were stated as being identified needs, Namibian ownership, evidence of political will, measurable commitment and contribution, willingness and capacity to account, compliance with donor policies, value should be added by the envisaged intervention, and the intervention should not duplicate but rather complement existing activities. The underlying objective of the individual activities to be embarked upon was the strengthening of the interface between the state and civil society.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 129 of 134The advisory mission indicated that the Netherlands' Government would consider favourably gender and HIV/AIDS related issues to be addressed under the new development co-operation arrangement. The mission's report will be widely discussed and implementation is not expected to commence before 2001. E. Finland The overall objectives of the Finish development assistance to Namibia are to alleviate poverty, combat environmental threats and promote good governance, democracy and human rights. Finland's development co-operation arrangement with Namibia, with an annual allocation of approximately FIM 40 million, covers the following areas: Health and Social Sector Support Programme (only indirectly covering HIV/AIDS); Namibia-Finland Forestry Programme; Community Water Supply Management Support Programme; Institution and Capacity Building for the Ministry of Finance; Sustainable Development Information and Communication Programme; Bush Encroachment Management Programme; Support to the Decentralisation Programme; Democracy Fund, Culture Fund, Small Projects Fund; and Support to NGO Activities. Finland will phase out its development assistance by 2007. The decision to discontinue development co-operation is based on Namibia's high per capita income and the countries high budgetary allocation for the defence portfolio. After 2007, co-operation will be on a smaller scale, NGO support and support to institutional collaboration between Finish and Namibian institutions. F. United States of America The objective of USAID's programme is to strengthen Namibia through the economic, social and political empowerment of the Namibians historically Disadvantaged by apartheid. USAID operates in the following five programme areas, namely economic empowerment of historically disadvantaged Namibians through accelerated private sector growth (training of GRN officials, management and technical training of private sector personnel, SME support); institutional capacity building in order to provide managerial and technical training to small and medium size businesses;United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 130 of 134 improved delivery of quality primary education to grade 1-4 learners in the most disadvantaged schools (educational reform, training of teachers, production of instruction and assessment materials, introduction of new monitoring and evaluation system for basic education); institutional capacity building (decentralisation) of ministerial bodies; school governance; increased benefits to historically disadvantaged Namibians from sustainable management of local natural resources (creation of conservancies); policy support to Ministry; institutional capacity building (government and civil society) to manage more effectively; increased accountability of Parliament to all Namibian citizens (improve Parliamentary processes, transparency and accountability, public hearings); including support to NGO's and civil society to conduct advocacy campaigns; and HIV/AIDS initiative; expansion after proven success into additional key areas (and nationally). The financial frame for the activities for 2000 is US$ 9.3 million. It is foreseen to continue co-operation at the current level until 2005. Scope and scale of aid delivery will then be reviewed. G. United Kingdom DfID's strategy for development co-operation focuses resources on: enhancing productive capacity and conserving the environment; and helping people achieve better education and health, and widening opportunities, especially for women. Interventions, worth approximately \u00a3 4 million annually, include the following programmes: primary education and literacy development (improve standards of literacy and language teaching; project completed ended in April 2000); English language training development (improve quality of English language teaching; project completed in March 2000); total child project (activities aimed at girl child in the Aminuis area in eastern Namibia; explores ways to sensitise individuals, the community and the educational institutions so that they can develop strategies to challenge the assumptions and practice of racism and sexism and rebuild sound social and institutional structures; findings could be replicated by institutions responsible for education); technical co-operation training awards (project and non-project related study awards) malaria control programme (social marketing of insecticide treated bed nets and re-treatment services; awareness raising; emphasis on the protection of pregnant women and children under 5 years of age);United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 131 of 134 health management strengthening programme (accredited in-service management training; strengthening regional management in the north-western Regions); SADC regional information system (improve the management of marine fisheries in the Southern African Region); wildlife integration for livelihood development (enable policy makers, planners, extension staff, community members and others to better make use of Namibia's conservancy legislation and natural resources; assist in the further development of new and existing conservancies in communal areas); northern Namibia environmental project (establishment of a comprehensive environmental Global Information System (GIS) of the 4-O Regions and functional remote sensing capacity at the Etosha Ecological Institute; projects to promote tourism, handicrafts and wildlife reintroduction); Kavango farming systems research and extension project (farming systems documented and farmers trained to conduct agronomic trials; introduction of participatory techniques and the Farming Systems Research approach to researchers and extension workers; first part of the project concluded in March 2000 and an extension of the activities along similar lines is under consideration); and development of agricultural statistics (project completed during June 2000). In addition, DfID's funds a regional programme on HIV/AIDS, which covers Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and Namibia. The programme is implemented through UNAIDS. H. France French Co-operation (FC), to the extent of FF 30 million, assists Namibia in the areas of rural development; HIV/AIDS; cultural co-operation; and crime prevention. The French funded HIV/AIDS initiative is aimed at extension, prevention and international exposure of facts on AIDS in Namibia (a full account of FC interventions in Namibia since 1990 is currently being translated into English, and the English version is expected to be available during September 2000). French development assistance is allocated in 3-year cycles, which means that co- operation will continue at least until 2003 when conditions will be reviewed.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 132 of 134ANNEX 3 - Lessons Learned from UN System Co-operation During the formulation of UNDAF, a number of lessons learned have been identified. The UN System will address the issues raised during country programming activities within the agreed guidelines of UNDAF. Lessons learned include: Capacity building involves more than training. Enabling conditions should be established for civil servants and project staff to be able to perform effectively. These include a skilful management structure, especially supportive supervision, reporting and accountability, and the creation of a continual human and financial resource base. It has been recognised that capacity building, particularly at the level of the individual instead of the governing institution, has been time-consuming and costly, adding little value to the developmental objectives of co-operation programmes. It has also been realised that all capacity building initiatives ought to be based on an institutional needs assessment. It is possible to operationalise multi-sectoral, decentralised initiatives around priority areas such HIV prevention. The Youth Health and Development Programme has demonstrated that young people can, and are willing to, play an active role in HIV prevention and other issues. Community participation and community capacity strengthening are essential for good governance and a human rights approach to programming. The interface between service providers and communities is a major determinant in provoking community action and collective problem solving. There is a need to focus on a few, convergent programme areas. Thinly spread assistance is ineffective and increases the burden on management. Effective programme and project design, monitoring and evaluation requires relevant and updated data. At present, interventions are based predominantly on national averages, outdated information, or data not fully consistent with Namibia's development framework. The human development and poverty indices for Namibia's thirteen regions have resulted in a regional predisposition of development co-operation. Severe disparities within regions with a high HDI and a low HPI do exist and should be addressed. The basis for effective collaboration is a common understanding of essential concepts. The UN System in Namibia, in close co-operation with all stakeholders, has to define, reach agreement on, and internalise concepts such as poverty, poverty reduction, capacity building, a human rights approach to programming, and good governance. Subsequently, a common approach to address these concerns should be formulated.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 133 of 134 The sustainability of development co-operation interventions will be enhanced if policies intended to further good governance, in particular those related to decentralisation, commercialisation and civil service reform, are incorporated in the design of country programmes. The UN System's participatory approach to the identification of areas and frameworks of co-operation, the planning of interventions and the review of programmes, is both costly and time-consuming, but intended results are achieved. Activities, not directly linked to the respective mandates, comparative advantages and resource bases of UN Agencies are perpetuated due to the system of internal reviews and impact assessments. The very nature of the UN System, and its accountability to the international community, would allow for the increased utilisation of a process of external and independent appraisal. Opportunities for collaboration and resource mobilisation at county level are enhanced by way of frequent and continuous dialog within the UN System and between GRN, civil society and the donor community. The process leading to the formulation of UNDAF revealed options yet to be fully exploited39. 39 For details, refer to the section on \"Possible Interventions Identified During the UNDAF Process\" in Chapter 1 and to the section on \"Options for Resource Mobilisation and Collaboration\" in Chapter 5.United Nations Development Assistance Framework for NAMIBIA 134 of 134ANNEX 4 - Indicators for Common Country Assessment ANNEX 5 - Minutes of Meetings "}
