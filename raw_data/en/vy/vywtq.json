Chief among parents' concerns is a sense that there is not enough information about the vaccine for children or that more research needs to be done. Many parents also cite concerns about vaccine side effects and potential long-term effects. Key Points - COVID-19 vaccination is an important tool to help protect children and teens, especially from severe disease, hospitalization, or death. - Half of children younger than 18 years of age hospitalized with COVID-19 have no underlying medical conditions. - COVID-19 vaccination reduces the likelihood of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). - COVID-19 vaccination provides added protection for children and teens who previously were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., by further reducing the risk of reinfection). - The rare risk of myocarditis and pericarditis associated with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines\u2014mostly among male persons between the ages of 12 and 39 years\u2014may be further reduced with a longer time between the first and second dose. COVID-19 illness is a bigger risk factor for myocarditis for children and teens younger than 16 years of age than vaccination is.
