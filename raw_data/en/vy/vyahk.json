Several compounds have been studied for their mitochondria-targeting ability in cancer cells. These studies' outcomes have led to the invention of \"mitocans\", a category of drug known to precisely target the cancer cells' mitochondria. Based upon their mode of action, mitocans have been divided into eight classes. To date, different synthetic compounds have been suggested to be potential mitocans, but unfortunately, they are observed to exert adverse effects. Many studies have been published justifying the medicinal significance of large numbers of natural agents for their mitochondria-targeting ability and anticancer activities with minimal or no side effects. However, these natural agents have never been critically analyzed for their mitochondria-targeting activity. This review aims to evaluate the various natural agents affecting mitochondria and categorize them in different classes. Henceforth, our study may further support the potential mitocan behavior of various natural agents and highlight their significance in formulating novel potential anticancer therapeutics.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-09-23", "cleaned_text": "Natural Agents Targeting Mitochondria in Cancer [https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21196992](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21196992) [Bioactive Phytochemicals several research and therapeutics efforts, the exact cure for cancer is still elusive, and cancer has successfully invaded millions of lives. Different cancer treatment options like surgery, immunotherapy, hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are available. Still, these treatments could only control the disease for a short duration, later worsening the patient's condition. Researchers have aimed to exploit cancer cell vulnerabilities using various approaches, including identifying gene targets, discovering novel compounds, and developing technologies such as nanoparticles for selective targeting which can be effective against cancer growth [ [2](#B2-ijms-21-06992), [3](#B3-ijms-21-06992), [4](#B4-ijms-21-06992)]. Unfortunately, cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapy by resisting apoptosis and/or exporting the drugs outside the cell. [5](#B5-ijms-21-06992)]. Otto Warburg, in 1930, described the metabolic shifting that occurs in the mitochondria of cancer cells and called it the Warburg effect. The Warburg effect showed that cancer cells, unlike normal cells, rely heavily on oxidative glycolysis for their energy requirements [ [6](#B6-ijms-21-06992)]. Oxidative glycolysis in cancer cells serves as a source of glutamine, and glucose supplies most of the carbon, nitrogen, free energy, and reducing equivalents necessary to support cell growth and division. Thus, oxidative glycolysis confers advantages to cancer cells by allowing a fast conversion of nutrients into biomass to enable cell proliferation [ [7](#B7-ijms-21-06992), [8](#B8-ijms-21-06992), [9](#B9-ijms-21-06992)]. [10](#B10-ijms-21-06992)]. Along with oxidative glycolysis, mitochondria are also crucial for the proliferation of cancer cells. [ [11](#B11-ijms-21-06992)]. Additionally, the heavy dependence of some cancers on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for their ATP needs further highlights the importance of mitochondria in cancer [ [12](#B12-ijms-21-06992), [13](#B13-ijms-21-06992), [14](#B14-ijms-21-06992)]. In both scenarios, mitochondria-targeting treatments can disrupt OXPHOS machinery and lead to cancer cell death. [ [14](#B14-ijms-21-06992)]. Recent reports have also indicated that mitochondria are vital contributors in tumorigenesis through the process of metabolic reprogramming, mitochondrial depolarization, oxidative signaling, generation of ROS, encourage the hyperproliferation of cancer cells by supplying glucose in excess. The high glycolytic rate generates a lot of metabolic acids such as lactate and pyruvate; however, cancer cells have a higher intracellular pH (7.4) and a lower extracellular pH (~6.7-7.1) [ [22](#B22-ijms-21-06992)]. These pH conditions in cancer cells are just a complete inversion of the pH gradient compared to normal cells [ [23](#B23-ijms-21-06992), [24](#B24-ijms-21-06992), [25](#B25-ijms-21-06992)]. This hallmark of cancer cells lies in the overactivation of plasma membrane ion pumps and transporters that extrude protons and intrude other ions. The most common transporters expressed in cancer ions are rapidly extruded outside the cancer cells by the H+/monocarboxylate cotransporters. Due to high intracellular pH, these cells are lenient for cell proliferation and escape apoptosis [ [25](#B25-ijms-21-06992)]. Such a reversal in pH gradient further helps the metastatic progression of cancer cells [ [24](#B24-ijms-21-06992)]. [21](#B21-ijms-21-06992)]. This hyperpolarization may be due to the increased intracellular Ca2+ levels and upregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein in the cancer cells [ [27](#B27-ijms-21-06992), [28](#B28-ijms-21-06992)]. The change in expression levels of different adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) in cancer cells may also contribute to the hyperpolarization of mitochondria [ [29](#B29-ijms-21-06992)]. Therefore, including change in acidification of cytosol, the higher mitochondrial membrane potential is also observed as other mitochondria-associated hallmarks of cancer cells. Hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential in cancer cells may enhance the selective transfer of different mitochondria-targeting drugs into the cancer cells, which may induce apoptosis of the cancer cells. Studies also suggest that apoptosis in the cells can be triggered by damaging the DNA, elevating the oxidative stress, and depolarizing the mitochondria [ [30](#B30-ijms-21-06992)]. Another characteristic of cancer cell metabolism is the relatively higher ROS levels observed in the tumor cells than healthy cells. Excessive ROS levels in the cells are toxic and cause cell death [ [31](#B31-ijms-21-06992), [32](#B32-ijms-21-06992)]. However, in cancer cells, this higher ROS level contributes to transformation, proliferation, survival, migration, invasion, and metastasis of the tumor cells [ [33](#B33-ijms-21-06992)]. Recently, researchers have focused on exploiting these vulnerabilities and differences in ROS level to develop novel therapeutic agents that may trigger apoptosis in the cancer cells and eliminate the disease. [34](#B34-ijms-21-06992)]. An attempt to design better therapy has led to identifying compounds known as the \"mitocans, \"which are exclusively designed to target the cancer cells' mitochondria. The formulation of mitocans has primarily focused on elevating oxidative stress and destabilization of the mitochondrial membrane in cancer cells [ [35](#B35-ijms-21-06992), [36](#B36-ijms-21-06992), [37](#B37-ijms-21-06992)], ultimately shutting down the cancer cells mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. [38](#B38-ijms-21-06992)], but they ultimately aim to induce mitochondria-mediated apoptosis of the cancer cells. The classified mitocans are in various phases of clinical trials. However, unlike any other synthetic drugs, there is a possibility that those mitocans could also hold their side effects. To minimize or eradicate their plausible side effects, simultaneously an exploratory study is going on. Thus far, these studies suggested the utilization of anticancer herbs as a source of potential mitocans, which may be termed as the \"Herbal mitocans\" [ [39](#B39-ijms-21-06992)]. The interest on anticancer herbs arises from the fact that ancient times always relied on the medicinal herbs, which demonstrated excellent effectiveness on many diseases such as malaria, diarrhea, tuberculosis, pneumonia, and asthma [ [40](#B40-ijms-21-06992)]. So, why not formulate herbal mitocans with minimal or no side effects? There are a handful of natural agents that are reported to influence the mitochondria in cancer cells. We have also come across different herbal extracts, tagged with the preliminary evidence of affecting these cells' mitochondria and possibly can be a source of potential herbal mitocans. Though the individual studies indicate the importance of these natural agents, however, there is a lack of systematic compilation of all the research outcomes and justification for their suitable mitocan class, which can further emphasize the need for functional validation of all such compounds/ extracts. Our current review is an attempt to fill these gaps in the research area of mitocans. 2. Mitocans: The Alternative Cancer Therapy 2.1. The Inception [9](#B9-ijms-21-06992)]. Thus glycolytic rate is observed to be dramatically high in the early stage of cancer. As the process of glycolysis is linked and dependent on mitochondrial activity [ [41](#B41-ijms-21-06992), [42](#B42-ijms-21-06992), [43](#B43-ijms-21-06992), [44](#B44-ijms-21-06992)], mitochondria have been proposed to be one of the vital suspects in the etiology of cancer. Moreover, mitochondrial metabolism is also dependent on different types of proteins as well as biochemical processes. For instance, Bcl-2 family proteins regulate the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore opening, followed by the release of apoptogenic proteins from mitochondria to the cytosol and apoptosis [ [45](#B45-ijms-21-06992), [46](#B46-ijms-21-06992), [47](#B47-ijms-21-06992)]. Similarly, defects in the electron transport chain (ETC) and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) that occurs within the mitochondria also affect the ATP and ROS levels. They may eventually affect cancer cell metabolism [ [48](#B48-ijms-21-06992), [49](#B49-ijms-21-06992)]. Therefore, defects in such proteins/processes could cause cellular stress in the cancer cell and bring them into mitochondria-mediated apoptosis [ [7](#B7-ijms-21-06992)]. By looking at the importance of mitochondria in cancer cells, different drug/compounds have been studied, either directly or indirectly targeting the mitochondria. In 2009, Ralph and Neuzil reviewed such compounds that we can target the cancer cells' mitochondria in different ways and termed them as \"mitocans\" [ [50](#B50-ijms-21-06992)]. Cancer cells are metabolically and bioenergetically different from healthy cells; hence the broad aim of all the mitocans is to trigger either the cytostatic or cytotoxic effects on tumor cells by targeting the various checkpoints significance of these proteins in the survival of cancer cells and the importance of targeting such proteins to enhance specificity in cancer therapeutics. [54](#B54-ijms-21-06992), [55](#B55-ijms-21-06992), [56](#B56-ijms-21-06992)]. Proliferating cells show a metabolic profile different from resting cells. This is further characterized by an increased glycolysis rate and an increase in lactic fermentation at the expense of OXPHOS. Various studies have suggested that to facilitate the transportation of ADP and ATP across the mitochondrial membrane, two types of ANT channels, ANT1 and ANT2, are present in mitochondria's inner membrane [ [29](#B29-ijms-21-06992)]. ANT1 helps to transport ADP into the matrix and ATP (produced by ATP synthase) in the intermembrane space. In cancer cells, ANT1 is downregulated and instead, ANT2 is overexpressed in these cells. ANT2 also transports the same molecules, but transportation is facilitated in the opposite direction. ANT2 is predicted to export ADP from the matrix to the cytosol in exchange for ATP. In this way, the ATP synthase switches in the reverse mode: it hydrolyzes ATP and pumps protons across the inner membrane, thereby creating a state of hyperpolarization. This drop in ATP levels can also facilitate cytosolic glycolysis and further lactate production. The hyperpolarized state is predicted to protect the cancer cells from apoptosis, too [ [29](#B29-ijms-21-06992)]. [57](#B57-ijms-21-06992)] and acidify the cancer cells' cellular microenvironment. This further leads to the weakening of the immune cells, increases the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and thus stimulates the angiogenesis and cell migrations [ [57](#B57-ijms-21-06992)]. Angiogenesis is the lifeline for the cancer cell because it would supply oxygen for their growth and proliferation. [51](#B51-ijms-21-06992), [53](#B53-ijms-21-06992)]. Although there are four isoforms of hexokinases, only HKII plays a crucial role in cancer cell survival and proliferation. HKII binds to the VDAC at the outer mitochondrial membrane and facilitates their interaction with ANT. This interaction couples the aerobic glycolysis with the OXPHOS and enables the HKII to exchange ADP for ATP from the inner mitochondrial membrane, further increasing the glycolysis rate [ [58](#B58-ijms-21-06992), [59](#B59-ijms-21-06992)]. VDAC is also known to play a crucial role in apoptosis by releasing cytochrome c from mitochondria. However, in cancer cells, most of the VDAC is primarily occupied with HKII proteins, which eventually block the release of cytochrome c through VDAC [ [47](#B47-ijms-21-06992)]. The anti-apoptotic proteins are also highly expressed which hinders the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells [ [60](#B60-ijms-21-06992)]. All these changes in the expression of essential proteins involved in glycolytic pathways may promote cancer cell survival and, consequently, proliferation. From this mechanism, it is clear that inhibition of glucose transporters, HKII, VDAC, ANT, and lactate transporters can trigger cytostatic status in cancer cells and, hence, behave as promising targets of cancer therapy. [Figure 1](#ijms-21-06992-f001)) in cancer cells. The Bcl-2 family proteins regulate the phenomenon of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. The pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (i.e., Bax and Bak) are activated upon stress-inducing stimuli [ [61](#B61-ijms-21-06992)]. The activated pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins oligomerize in the mitochondrial outer membrane by forming a pore to escape the mitochondria's apoptotic molecules. On the other side, the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (i.e., Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL) regulate this intrinsic cell death pathway by preventing Bax and Bak's activation. The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins are highly expressed in cancer cells [ [62](#B62-ijms-21-06992)] and increase the mitochondrial outer membrane potential to inhibit the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria [ [62](#B62-ijms-21-06992)]. Thus, to trigger cell death in cancer cells, the aim should be to reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential and trigger cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol, followed by cell cancer another mitocan that selectively inhibits HKII by specifically binding to HKII and inhibiting the enzymatic activity of HKII. Moreover, benserazide had reduced the glucose uptake, production of lactate, and intracellular ATP levels. As a result, the loss of membrane potential increases and causes apoptosis of the cancer cell [ [65](#B65-ijms-21-06992)]. 2.1.2. Class 2 Mitocans: Compounds Targeting Bcl-2 Family Proteins [66](#B66-ijms-21-06992)]. The pore in the mitochondrial outer membrane is formed by the oligomers of pro-apoptotic Bax or Bak proteins, so the increased expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, or Mcl-1 interacting with the BH3 domain will protect the cancer cells from apoptosis. [67](#B67-ijms-21-06992)]. Therefore, agents that may act as or mimic the BH3 domain can target the interaction between the pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins common to class 2 of mitocans. This BH3 mimetics or the agents have shown to interact with the BH3 binding domains and disrupt the interaction of pro-apoptotic (Bax or Bak) and [70](#B70-ijms-21-06992), enhances the channel's formation in the mitochondrial outer membrane that can release pro-apoptotic molecules such as the cytochrome c and promote apoptosis of the cancer cells. 2.1.3. Class 3 Mitocans: Thiol Redox Inhibitors [73](#B73-ijms-21-06992)]. This class of mitocans oxidizes the thiol groups, leading to depletion of the GSH pool in the mitochondria and apoptosis of the cancer cells [ [74](#B74-ijms-21-06992), [75](#B75-ijms-21-06992)]. For example, arsenic trioxide and phenethyl isothiocyanates are class 3 mitocan that have been shown to disturb the normal homeostasis in the cellular redox environment and selectively kill the cancer cells [ [76](#B76-ijms-21-06992), [77](#B77-ijms-21-06992)]. 2.1.4. Class 4 Mitocans: VDAC/ANT Targeting to the VDAC and transfers ADP to the ANT1; thus, ANT1 provides ATP to HKII via the VDAC. [60](#B60-ijms-21-06992)]. Therefore, it can be a potential therapeutic intervention in cancer. Thus, the compounds targeting VDAC/ANT1 and inhibiting the binding of VDAC with the anti-apoptotic proteins can be used as a tool to allow apoptosis and fight cancer. Compounds such as lonidamine, arsenites, and steroid analogs are known to modulate the PTP complex that leads to the generation of oxidative stress and induction of apoptosis [ [79](#B79-ijms-21-06992)]. 2.1.5. Class 5 Mitocans: Electron Transport Chain Targeting Drugs [80](#B80-ijms-21-06992), [81](#B81-ijms-21-06992)]. The deregulated ETC can lead to high ROS generation and shut down vital machinery of cellular metabolism. Based on a similar principle, class 5 mitocans can potentially deregulate ETC complexes and elevate the cancer cells' ROS levels, leading to cell death. For example, Sorafenib is observed to inhibit ETC complex II, complex III, and ATP synthase in HeLa cells. The dual inhibition of these enzymes further stabilizes and elevates the expression of serine-threonine protein kinase PINK1 on mitochondria's outer membrane. Sorafenib the of the ubiquitin E3 ligase Parkin to damaged mitochondria in these cells. Though PINK1/Parkin is traditionally known to trigger mitophagy in damaged mitochondria, sorafenib treatment triggers PINK1/Parkin-dependent cellular apoptosis. Thus Sorafenib is considered mitocan, and it is also proposed that high Parkin activity levels could make tumor cells more sensitive to sorafenib's actions [ [82](#B82-ijms-21-06992)]. Tamoxifen, which is called MitoTam, has shown an inhibitory effect on the ETC's complex I, which further caused ROS elevation and cell death [ [83](#B83-ijms-21-06992)]. Metformin, an anti-diabetic drug, has also been repurposed for their cancer study and demonstrated a direct effect on the mitochondria by inhibiting the OXPHOS and limiting the citric acid cycle activity in cancer cells [ [84](#B84-ijms-21-06992)]. 2.1.6. Class 6 mitocans: Lipophilic Cations Targeting the Inner Membrane [85](#B85-ijms-21-06992)]. This feature of the cancer cells makes the lipophilic cations such as Rhodamine-123 and tetraphenylphosphonium ion salts more selective towards the cancer cells. The invention of this class 6 mitocans is based on the Nernst law, which describes that each increase of mitochondrial transmembrane potential by 60 mV corresponds to 10 fold higher accumulation of cationic compounds in the inner mitochondrial membrane [ [86](#B86-ijms-21-06992)]. The lipophilic cations penetrate through the hydrophobic barriers of the plasma membrane and mitochondrial membrane and selectively accumulate in the cancer cell's inner mitochondrial membrane. As a result, the positively charged lipophilic cations reduce the cancer cell mitochondrial membrane's negative transmembrane potential. The reduced mitochondrial membrane potential may allow various apoptogenic factors like cytochrome c and ROS from the mitochondria and lead to cell death. Moreover, the accumulated lipophilic cations interfere with cells' physiological function (KLAKKLAK)2 is a pro-apoptotic peptide conjugated with penetration that has shown deleterious and selective action on cancer cells by forming a pore in the mitochondrial membrane and establishing significant hydrophobic interactions and F16 are lipophilic selectively accumulates in the mitochondria has shown antiproliferative action towards human gastric carcinoma (SGC-7901) and human breast cancer (MCF-7) cell lines [ [88](#B88-ijms-21-06992)]. 2.1.7. Class 7 Mitocans: Drugs Targeting the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle [89](#B89-ijms-21-06992)]. Moreover, DCA promotes pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and leads to a metabolic shift from anaerobic to aerobic glycolysis and increases the ROS level. The therapeutic efficiency of DCA is predicted to be dependent on the metabolic profile of cancer cells, and it is also observed that cells with defective mitochondrial metabolism are more sensitive to DCA treatment [ [89](#B89-ijms-21-06992), [90](#B90-ijms-21-06992)]. Similarly, the mitocan 3BP is also known to the succinate dehydrogenase enzyme, which coverts succinate to fumarate and slow down the TCA cycle [ [91](#B91-ijms-21-06992)]. 2.1.8. Class 8 Mitocans: Drugs Targeting mtDNA [92](#B92-ijms-21-06992)]. Class 8 mitocans are known to target the mtDNA of the cancer cells by interfering with the mtDNA stability and affecting the activity of polymerase- that is specific for replicating mtDNA. For example, vitamin K3 or menadione is the mitocan that targets the mtDNA by inhibiting the activity of mtDNA polymerase-, thereby inducing apoptosis of the cancer cells [ [93](#B93-ijms-21-06992)]. Another mitocan is the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium that directly destabilized the D-loop in HeLa cells [ [94](#B94-ijms-21-06992)]. Rhodocyanine dye MKT-077 selectively induced mtDNA damage in the CX-l cell line (human colon carcinoma) and also inhibits mitochondrial respiration, indicating MKT-007 [96](#B96-ijms-21-06992)]. [97](#B97-ijms-21-06992), [98](#B98-ijms-21-06992)]. p53 is mutated in about half of cancers, and mutant p53 promotes adaptive responses to cancer-related stress conditions to support tumor progression [ [97](#B97-ijms-21-06992)]. Studies indicate that mutant p53 up-regulates the glucose metabolism and OXPHOS in cancer cells [ [99](#B99-ijms-21-06992), [100](#B100-ijms-21-06992)] and thus shown to sustain anabolic growth by enhancing glucose import and promoting the Warburg effect mutant p53 knock-in mice [ [101](#B101-ijms-21-06992)]. Anticancer therapies based on drug combinations that either directly or indirectly hit mutant p53-dependent homeostatic circuits can be expected to provide several exciting therapeutic possibilities. To break such circuits, the use of mitocans can be a promising approach. [102](#B102-ijms-21-06992)]. Zn is an important component of the antioxidant network, and growing pieces of evidence indicate its involvement in redox-regulated signaling [ [103](#B103-ijms-21-06992), [104](#B104-ijms-21-06992)]. Though the mechanisms through which Zn contributes to balancing the redox are still partially known and the subject of active research. Most commonly, the Zn deficiency is known to disrupt p53 function [ [105](#B105-ijms-21-06992)] and disturb the cellular redox in esophageal, head, and neck cancer cells [ [106](#B106-ijms-21-06992), [107](#B107-ijms-21-06992), [108](#B108-ijms-21-06992), [109](#B109-ijms-21-06992), [110](#B110-ijms-21-06992)] 2.2. The Evolution and Current Status of Mitocans [111](#B111-ijms-21-06992)]. The main reason for their termination from the study was their low sensitivity and efficacy, which was reported to be the significant limitations associated with different synthetic mitocans studied so far. For example, mitocans like 1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium, 2DG, vitamin K3, DCA, and F16 were terminated from the clinical trial. These mitocans failed to prove themselves in terms of sensitivity and efficacy in the latter stage of clinical trials. On the other side, Mito-LND and NSC13062 are the compounds that have the preliminary evidence of affecting the mitochondria of cancer cells and are proposed as [112](#B112-ijms-21-06992), [113](#B113-ijms-21-06992), [114](#B114-ijms-21-06992), widely studied synthetic mitocans, their class, and associated studies. Despite so much trial and studies, we do not have any ready to use mitocan, but the attempts are still ongoing. Perhaps, these compounds require more experimental pieces of evidence to proceed for the clinical trials. 3. Natural Agents as Mitocans: The Alternative Approach to Overcome the Limitations of Synthetic Mitocans [39](#B39-ijms-21-06992)]. There is no doubt that the folklore medicines used in ancient times have left an impeccable record of healing several diseases [ [40](#B40-ijms-21-06992)]. These ancient folklore medicines are known to be more organic. There is no doubt that ancient age has always relied on herbal medicines and lived longer with minimal health issues. The centuries-old practice of natural remedies is still followed in the present Ayurveda and Unani treatments, which are well known for their significant and long-lasting results [ [149](#B149-ijms-21-06992), [150](#B150-ijms-21-06992), [151](#B151-ijms-21-06992)]. This has encouraged the current research to utilize the folklore medicinal herbs to formulate naturally derived drugs and redirect the scientific fraternity towards the formulation of natural mitocans (i.e., mitocans derived from the natural medicinal herbs). The search for natural mitocans has begun. A good number of natural agents are known to exhibit the anticancer property. Based upon their ability to affect the mitochondrial function (either directly or indirectly) in cancer cells, they may be suggested to behave as potential mitocans. Apart from pure natural compounds, different plant-derived crude extracts are also reported to exhibit mitochondria-targeting ability in cancer cells. 3.1. Classification of Natural Agents and Plant Extracts as Mitocans [152](#B152-ijms-21-06992)]. On the other hand, gossypol is known to act as a pro-apoptotic protein by inhibiting the Bcl-2 family protein observed in leukemic cells [ [70](#B70-ijms-21-06992), [153](#B153-ijms-21-06992)] Based on their mode of action, these two compounds have been classified under class 3 and 2 of the mitocan class. In the following section of the review, we have summarized all the reported natural agents and their known action mechanisms. After reviewing their detailed anticancer activities, we have further categorized these natural agents under suitable mitocan classes and put forth a possible explanation for the same ( [Table 2](#ijms-21-06992-t002)). [Table 3](#ijms-21-06992-t003)). After analyzing all the studies regarding natural agents and plant extracts, we interestingly observed that most of these compounds belong to the class 1 (inhibitors of HKII), class 2 (compounds targeting Bcl-2 family proteins), class 3 (compounds elevating the ROS level), and class 6 (lipophilic cations targeting inner membrane) ( [Table Agents which Inhibit HKII [54](#B54-ijms-21-06992), [55](#B55-ijms-21-06992)]. To make it accessible in the form of energy, the glucose has to be broken down. To generate energy out of glucose, it undergoes glycolysis, which is the first cellular respiration pathway that oxidizes glucose molecules and produces pyruvic acid (pyruvate), ATP, and reduced NADH. The very first enzyme, or the critical mediator of aerobic glycolysis, is the HKII [ [190](#B190-ijms-21-06992)]. In normal cells, the incoming glucose and ATP as another substrate binds to HKII, leading to the production of G6P, which is distributed for the shunting [ [191](#B191-ijms-21-06992)]. HMP functions, i.e., generating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH) and providing ribose 5-phosphate (R5P). However, there are individual differences observed in the cancer cell environment. It starts with the overexpression of HKII in cancer cells, and hence, the rate of glucose uptake is also higher [ [55](#B55-ijms-21-06992)]. The high rate of glycolysis may lead to excessive production of ATP and lactate in these cells. Increased ATP amounts may help in cell proliferation, and higher amounts of lactate would be exported outside these cells by suitable transporter proteins (as explained above). The higher lactate level reduces the extracellular pH that, in turn, helps in the migration and invasion of cancer cells. [172](#B172-ijms-21-06992)]. Apart from these in vitro models, different in vivo studies have used both mM and uM concentrations of MJ in various animal models. As a result, MJ was observed to exhibit the antiproliferative effect and increased survival of animals. Interestingly, none of the studies report any significant toxicity in normal cells [ [173](#B173-ijms-21-06992), [192](#B192-ijms-21-06992), [193](#B193-ijms-21-06992), [194](#B194-ijms-21-06992), MJ enhanced dissociation of HKII from mitochondria and hence inhibited glucose uptake and lactate generation, causing inhibition of cancer cell energy metabolism and triggering cell death ( [Figure 3](#ijms-21-06992-f003)). Therefore, based on these suggested effects of MJ and curcumin on the activity of HKII, we may propose these compounds to belong to class 1 of mitocans. 3.3. Natural Agents Targeting Bcl-2 Family Proteins [61](#B61-ijms-21-06992)]. These three groups of the Bcl-2 family proteins function via different mechanisms of actions to regulate the apoptosis process of the cell. In response to apoptosis stimulus (cellular stress, i.e., damage to the lipids, proteins, DNA, and RNA), the pro-apoptosis proteins are activated. Upon activation, BH3-only proteins form a hydrophobic groove and bind to the Bcl-2 proteins, whose hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal domain is linked to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Henceforth, this binding of BH3-only proteins inhibits the anti-apoptosis action of the Bcl-2 proteins. Additionally, the other pro-apoptosis proteins Bax and Bak in their active form are known to oligomerize in the form of homo-/hetero-oligomers. These oligomers of Bax or Bak form a pore-like structure that permeabilizes the mitochondrial outer membrane to execute several apoptogenic molecules from the mitochondrion. Apoptogenic molecules such as cytochrome c activate the apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), which in its activated form binds to the caspase-9 to form the apoptosome complex. This complex activates caspase-3, triggering the activation of different executioner caspases and complete cell death [ [34](#B34-ijms-21-06992)]. Over the past years, cancer therapeutics have been conceptualized to either initiate the pro-apoptotic proteins or inhibit anti-apoptotic proteins in killing the cancer cell [ [70](#B70-ijms-21-06992), [71](#B71-ijms-21-06992), [72](#B72-ijms-21-06992), [87](#B87-ijms-21-06992)]. Different experimental studies revealed that flavokawain A, berberine, asiatic acid, and andrographolide are the natural agents that induce apoptosis mediated via the action of Bcl-2 family proteins. [170](#B170-ijms-21-06992)]. Another study on bladder cancer cells (T24 cells) and bladder tumor cells induced in a mice model also revealed an increase in active Bax protein. Moreover, this study also observed compromised levels of Bcl-XL expression and a further decrease in the association of Bcl-XL to Bax. [171](#B171-ijms-21-06992)]. The anti-cancer property of Berberine, a bioactive compound of Coptidis rhizoma, was also studied in breast cancer cells (MCF-7), liver cancer cells (HUH-7), and oral cancer cells (HSC). As a result, it was evident that berberine exhibited a similar anti-cancer mechanism like flavokawain A [ [163](#B163-ijms-21-06992), [164](#B164-ijms-21-06992), [165](#B165-ijms-21-06992)]. Additionally, the impact of berberine studied in normal breast cancer cells (MCF-12F) revealed their non-toxicity towards the normal breast cells [ [164](#B164-ijms-21-06992)]. [160](#B160-ijms-21-06992)]. Another study by Tang et al. (2009) suggests that asiatic acid induces loss of MMP and releases cytochrome c, which further activates the caspase activity and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage resulting in apoptotic death in the tumor cells [ [161](#B161-ijms-21-06992)]. The effect of asiatic acid was also studied on human lung cancer cell lines (A549 and H1299) and tumor-induced mice model. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that there was a loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity leading to generation of ROS and mitochondria-mediated cell death [ [162](#B162-ijms-21-06992)]. [157](#B157-ijms-21-06992)]. This arrest in the cell cycle was found to be correlated with altered expression of Bax and Bcl-2 proteins and cell death [ [157](#B157-ijms-21-06992)]. Interestingly, a study conducted by Yang et al. further highlighted that andrographolide treatment significantly altered Bax proteins' conformation in hepatocellular carcinoma (SMMC-7721) cells [ [158](#B158-ijms-21-06992)]. Apart from its usual effect on pro- and anti-apoptotic protein expression, andrographolide was also observed to increase the ROS level in colon cancer cells (T84 and COLO 205) [ [159](#B159-ijms-21-06992)]. [169](#B169-ijms-21-06992)]. [Table 3](#ijms-21-06992-t003), we also reviewed and observed that most crude extracts of anti-cancer herbs reported to target the mitochondria of cancer cells were influencers of Bcl-2 family proteins. The anti-cancer effect of various natural extracts of the following eight studied on different cancer cell lines such as the human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells (Hone-1), gastric adenocarcinoma cells (AGS), colorectal carcinoma cells (HCT-116), lung adenocarcinoma cell (CL1-0), human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231), human liver cancer cells (Hep G2), gastric cancer cells (MKN-74), human skin epidermoid carcinoma (A431), human colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29), and prostate cancer cells (PC3). These studies suggested that the crude extracts of all these anti-cancer herbs shared the common mechanism of actions. All these natural extracts significantly increased the expression of Bax protein and also decreased the level of Bcl-2 protein in individual cancer cells. Consequently, the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio increases, and the in the cytosol further induces the signal of cell death by intrinsic pathway. The schematic representation of the illustrated mechanism in cancer cells is shown in [Figure 4](#ijms-21-06992-f004). 3.4. Natural Agents as ROS Elevators [198](#B198-ijms-21-06992)]. The redox environment of cancer cells is distinct from that of normal cells. To keep up with their uncontrolled rate of proliferation and higher energy demands, cancer cells have an elevated metabolic rate. [199](#B199-ijms-21-06992)]. These oxidation products may protect the target proteins from further oxidation that can permanently damage the target proteins. Hence, such oxidative modifications can enhance the protein functioning and signal for cell survival and proliferation in cancer cells. Thus, the elevated levels of ROS may boost oxidative modifications and encourage survival and the further vigorous proliferation of cancer cells. In cancer, however, the ROS level is comparatively much higher, but the further increase may trigger oxidative damage to these cells [ [200](#B200-ijms-21-06992)]. Such compounds which increase the ROS levels are known as \"pro-oxidants\" [ [201](#B201-ijms-21-06992)]. Therefore, further elevating the levels of ROS may be used as an important aspect of cancer therapeutics. It was observed that the natural agent bezeille extracted from Scutellaria barbata has the potential to target mitochondria of the cancer cell by elevating their ROS level that may, in turn, inhibit their glycolysis OXPHOS. Inhibition of these processes may bring the cell to a lower energy state and further lead to their apoptotic phase. Experimental evidence suggests that bezeille (ROS elevator) may trigger the apoptosis of breast cancer cells (MDAMB231) in three different ways [ [167](#B167-ijms-21-06992)]. Firstly, an elevated level of ROS may cause DNA damage due to oxidative stress. Subsequently, in response to DNA damage, the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a repair enzyme for DNA damage, gets activated. As NAD+ is a known substrate for PARP, hence with excessive activation of PARP, the NAD+ levels were observed to reduce in MDAMB231 cells. [167](#B167-ijms-21-06992)]. [174](#B174-ijms-21-06992)]. Based on evidence-based studies, bezeille, withanone, and crude extract of Withania somnifera can be distributed under class 3 of mitocans which are explained to elevate the level of oxidative stress, affecting the equilibrium of cellular redox, a significant factor responsible for inducing mitochondria-mediated cell death in cancer cells ( [Figure 5](#ijms-21-06992-f005)). 3.5. Natural Agents Reducing the Mitochondrial Membrane Potential [202](#B202-ijms-21-06992)]. The movement of electrons through these four complexes produces energy, which is utilized to pump protons from the mitochondrial matrix to its intermembrane space. However, the pumped protons in the intermembrane area cannot move out because the mitochondrial membrane does not allow the passage of ions. As a result, it generates an electrochemical gradient where the intermembrane space holds a higher concentration of H+ ions, and the matrix contains the lower concentration of H+ ions. This electrochemical gradient causes the mitochondrial membrane potential. It drives the pumping back of H+ ions from intermembrane space to its matrix through the enzyme ATP synthase that synthesizes ATP from ADP and phosphate (Pi) [ [203](#B203-ijms-21-06992)]. Altogether, the cells must maintain a hyperpolarized voltage across their inner mitochondrial membranes. If this hyperpolarization dissipates, the voltage-sensitive PTP will open and release pro-apoptotic agents (e.g., cytochrome c) into the cytoplasm and lead to apoptotic cell death [ [30](#B30-ijms-21-06992)]. [175](#B175-ijms-21-06992), [176](#B176-ijms-21-06992)]. Similarly, there are also different crude reported to cause loss of mitochondrial membrane potential of human cervical cancer (SiHa), mouse hepatoma cells (H22), oral squamous cell cancer (Ca9-22), human colon adenocarcinoma cells (HT-29), and cancer cells (MCF-7), respectively [ [181](#B181-ijms-21-06992), [182](#B182-ijms-21-06992), [184](#B184-ijms-21-06992), [188](#B188-ijms-21-06992)]. This loss of mitochondrial membrane potential permeabilizes the release of various apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c, which further leads to apoptosis of the cancer cells. However, it is not yet clear about the mechanism of whether the observed loss of mitochondrial membrane potential is for the inner membrane or the outer membrane of the mitochondria. 4. Conclusions and Future Perspectives [204](#B204-ijms-21-06992), [205](#B205-ijms-21-06992), [206](#B206-ijms-21-06992), [207](#B207-ijms-21-06992), [208](#B208-ijms-21-06992)]. Studies also revealed that p53, the major checkpoints protein, is at the crossroad between cancer and dementia. The misfolded p53 is considered to be an early indicator of dementia [ [209](#B209-ijms-21-06992)]. In most of the NDDs, including dementia, the deregulation of mitochondrial functions leads to high ROS production, eventually causing altered signaling of the apoptotic mechanisms and cell death of neurons. As NDDs, together with cancer, represents a burden for both caregivers and society, and mitochondrial dysfunction is a key factor in the pathogenesis of NDDs, the compounds targeting mitochondria of neuronal cells should also be investigated. However, the aim to use mitochondria-targeting drugs in neuronal cells should be entirely different from cancer. As mitocans aim to induce mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells, the compound targeting mitochondria of neurons should aim to improve the metabolism and prevent neuronal cells from apoptosis. Hence, the mitochondria-targeting compound in NDDs could aim to trigger selective autophagy of damaged mitochondria (mitophagy) in neurons, which is known to be impaired in most of the NDD-related cases.
