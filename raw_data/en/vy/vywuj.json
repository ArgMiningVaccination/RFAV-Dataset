By Tom Herrin Never before, at least in my lifetime, has the world awaited the successful development of a vaccine like it is now. Many of us have carefully watched and waited for any news of progress. As we read the news, or watch on television, most of us keep a careful ear open for any hope in combatting the pandemic that has swept the earth. As these new opportunities become more available for any of us to take advantage of, we must cautiously approach our personal decision. Many simply say, \"I'll gladly be first in line,\" while others say, \"I'll let everyone else take it first, then I will decide.\" There is no right or wrong, but we all have the need to consider our options early. Some Proven Successes We have had vaccines around now for more than 200 years starting with a fairly successful effort against smallpox. As many struggled for years to find vaccines for many other kinds of illnesses, some great successes followed. Until the twentieth century, many who died in war did so as a result of tetanus. This was because they were wounded by a sword, arrow, or bullet and the risk of this puncture introducing tetanus was great, and there was little way of treating it. The mortality rate from tetanus was around 30 percent. Unlike smallpox, which was a virus, tetanus will never be eradicated. It is a bacteria that forms spores that can live in the soil similar to a seed. It begins developing once it is inside a warm moist place with a food supply. Anyone can now be vaccinated against this successfully. Some Disappointments All vaccines have not gone as planned. Many have minor reactions such as red, swollen injections sites. Some have caused minor illness. Many result in fever. Some have caused seizures. Though rare, some have caused deaths. Many fear that some of the substandard manufacturing of the vaccines, such as has occurred in the past, can still take place. Some even fear that the newer kinds of vaccines that are based on codes, which have to do with genetics of the virus, are instead a way of implanting a code in the person. Read, Study, and Be Informed The best decision for each of us is one we make with all of the possible facts. We must be open to the facts on both sides. If we are deciding for our children, we must consider their past experiences with vaccines. The most important thing is to give a lot of thought ahead of time so that, when they are readily available, we will know whether to move forward or watch from a distance.
