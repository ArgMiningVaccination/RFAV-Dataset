Cinquegrana '63 Endowed Chair in Finance and Center for Financial Policy director, for evidence that: \"seasonal affective disorder\"(SAD) is the source of September's poor stock market performance. ...The authors of this recent study connected these monthly SAD changes with the stock market by measuring flows of cash into and out of equity mutual funds. After controlling for other possible factors that could potentially also explain those flows, the researchers found a high correlation between changes in the incidence of SAD and equity mutual fund flows. The month experiencing the biggest net outflow is September. Both a strong statistical and a strong theoretical case can therefore be made for why September may be a below-average month for stocks. While this doesn't guarantee that the stock market will lose ground in this coming September, it does increase the probability that it will decline.

Smith School of Business, sees Trump's third indictment posing a negative impact on DWAC stock. A former member of [multiple government offices](https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/directory/david-kass), including the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Kass is an expert on corporate finance and health economics. He shared with InvestorPlace that he believes multiple events may be pushing DWAC down. In his words: \"The indictment of former President Donald Trump with respect to the events of January 6, 2021, made the headlines and contributed to the 6% decline in DWAC on Wednesday. (The Nasdaq index declined by 2% on August 2.) Although the possibility of this indictment may have been discounted by the market, the news of the extent of the charges very likely contributed to DWAC's negative performance.\" The second factor that Kass highlights is the recent resignation of Marcum LLP, the accounting firm hired to audit Digital World. Bloomberg reports that the auditor has been dealing with regulatory problems of its own. While Kass notes that this news likely flew largely under the radar, he believes it could significantly impact DWAC stock as it puts the TMTG merger in even further jeopardy.

Smith School of Business, the outlook for Apple for the rest of the year is very bright. \"Apple, Berkshire's largest equity holding, representing about 50% of its $300+ billion portfolio, has the largest U.S. stock market capitalization of about $3 trillion,\" Kass said. \"It is growing rapidly and enjoys an extremely loyal customer base within its ecosystem. In addition to its cash dividend, it is returning capital to shareholders through a very large share buyback program. Berkshire currently owns 5.6% of Apple. Warren Buffett is a big fan of Apple CEO, Tim Cook.\" ... Buffett has been steadily increasing his stake in the company and has now accumulated more than 224,000 shares, representing a 25% stake...And according to Kass, this is the result of Berkshire CEO, Vicki Hollub, planning to use its free cash flow to pay down its debt and reduce its preferred stock, buy back its common shares, increase its cash dividends, and invest in projects where its return on capital exceeds its cost of capital. \"With oil prices likely to be stable in the months ahead, the outlook for Occidental is very good,\" said Kass. According to Kass, Bank of America, under CEO Brian Moynihan, is a very conservatively run bank and is Berkshire's second largest equity holding, representing about 10% of its portfolio. \"It recently announced a 9% increase in its quarterly cash dividend and is also buying back its shares. Its outlook is also very bright,\" said Kass. He added that although Buffett likes to receive cash dividends, he does not like to pay them to his shareholders. \"He prefers to re-invest the cash flow generated by Berkshire. Berkshire has not declared a dividend since 1967,\" Kass said.

Employees rarely negotiate noncompetes and are often given them after accepting a job offer, he and his research partners have found. Noncompetes can hold down wages and prevent workers from quitting to start their own businesses, Starr and other researchers have found. The Federal Trade Commission estimates that eliminating all noncompetes could raise U.S. workers' earnings by over $250 billion a year. ...A key question is how companies will respond if they can no longer use noncompetes, Starr said. Some may resort to suing over theft of trade secrets. Others may do nothing, he said. \"Maybe noncompetes were just prohibiting moves [to a rival business],\" he said, \"and there was actually no competitive threat.\" Barron's - July 11 - \" [After Spring Crisis, US Banks Face Subdued Profit Outlook](https://www.barrons.com/news/after-spring-crisis-us-banks-face-subdued-profit-outlook-2299ca6a)\" quotes Professor of the Practice Clifford Rossi: [Rossi] said the shift in monetary policy has also burdened banks with unrealized losses, which reflect the erosion in value of long-term US Treasury-linked assets due to interest rate increases. \"I think there's still a liquidity risk for some of these institutions until we get past these interest rate issues,\" Rossi said.

Berkshire's investment in Apple of $31 billion is worth about $175 billion today, representing a profit of $144 billion. Since Apple has a large stock buyback program, Berkshire's 5.6% stake in Apple is likely to grow to 6% in the near future without Berkshire buying any additional shares,\" he added.

Currently, brokers route orders to market makers based in part on how cheaply they have filled orders in the past, Ernst said, while the SEC proposal would require brokers to submit each individual order to a competitive market process. \"These auctions are actually less competitive than the current system,\" Ernst said. because market makers and exchanges would worry that they have less information about the order than their competitor, and therefore bid more conservatively. \"The winner's curse is if you win the auction, it means that everyone else thought that you bid too aggressively,\" he said.

Once they understand and narrow down the number of schools they are considering, the best advice is to engage with the admissions team. Every school hosts virtual webinars, invites students to engage with a recruiter and often offers the opportunity to digitally meet current students. It is equally important to understand why that school is a good fit for the candidate's post degree goals (i.e., a finance fund, an entrepreneurship center, etc.). The more a candidate invests in a specific program, the more the program understands if that candidate is a good fit for their program's value proposition. Baltimore Sun - March 18 - [Rudolph P.

Similarly, over the past 45 years, the 30-year Treasury has averaged 6.30%. It is currently at 3.87%. At a November 2016 meeting with University of Maryland students, Warren Buffett said, \"Stocks are cheap if long-term rates [30-year Treasury] are at 4%, four or five years from now.\" At that time, the 30-year Treasury was at 2.8%. Since equities are considered long-term investments, and most corporations borrow primarily long term to match the time horizon of their projects, today's historically low long-term interest rates should not be ignored in equity valuations. Discounted-cash-flow valuations are calculated by discounting future cash flows by the weighted average cost of capital. This calculation would incorporate a company's long-term cost of debt.. MIT Sloan Management Review - Feb. 22 - Associate Professor of Management and Organization Evan Starr gives an extended interview in \" [What an FTC Noncompete Ban Could Mean for Workers and Businesses](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/what-an-ftc-noncompete-ban-could-mean-for-workers-and-businesses/)\" (Full-length version also via [Tribune Content Agency](https://tribunecontentagency.com/article/what-an-ftc-noncompete-ban-could-mean-for-workers-and-businesses/)). Intro: In January, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission proposed a ban on noncompete clauses in employment contracts. In addition to barring new noncompete agreements with employees and independent contractors, the rule would require employers to rescind existing ones. To understand what a federal ban could mean for workers and businesses, why it's facing opposition, and how employers can prepare, we spoke with [Starr], who studies noncompetes at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business.

First, they determine whether speaking up would align with the goals of the recipient or the current situation (i.e., relevance). Second, they determine whether they are ready to talk or need to hold off until they collect more data, find a solution, or think through some other aspect of the problem or idea (i.e., readiness). Third, they wait until the recipient \u2014 usually a manager \u2014 is in the right cognitive (not too busy) or emotional state (not in a bad mood) to hear the message (i.e., responsiveness).

In the case in East Palestine, because it's an isolated incident and it hasn't been declared a disaster by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, \"it's more of a wait-and-see situation,\" Rossi said. Mortgage servicers could seek guidance from the GSEs, FHA and VA on how and when to offer forbearance and loan-modification programs to borrowers financially impacted by the train derailment and evacuation, Rossi said. Also, it can get trickier, Rossi said, if a borrower decides to not return to his home due to concern regarding health even after state officials have given an all-clear. \"The issue in this case is if there's no direct acknowledgment by a governmental agency that this is a bona fide existing health issue,\" then there likely won't be protections for borrowers who decide to walk away from their mortgage, he explained. \"The protocols have to be rooted in some scientific basis,\" Rossi added.
