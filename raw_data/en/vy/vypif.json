We understand through research that practices similar to acupuncture such as meditation can also have this effect. Meditation and mindfulness practices enhance the parasympathetic nervous system (your rested and relaxed state) while inhibiting the sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight mode). There are many other modalities that are effective for stress management, but I can't think of one that is more profound, effective, or cost-free than meditation. Benefits of Meditation Multiple studies have been completed on meditation suggesting that it can reduce anxiety, improve attention, lower pain levels, and increase the grey matter of our brains. Meditation also improves self awareness, creativity, and imagination. Studies have shown it to be an effective treatment for lowering blood pressure. When practiced regularly, mindfulness can help develop new perspectives on the same, stressful situations. The benefits of meditation are numerous according to research. However, I find [Elizabeth Blackburn's](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2009/blackburn/facts/) research on meditation and anti-aging to be the most fascinating. Meditation's Anti-Aging Effect Blackburn discovered in her [research ](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2011/02/9353/aging-telomeres-linked-chronic-disease-and-health)that meditation can increase the length of telomeres in your cells, effectively slowing the aging process. Telomeres are located at the ends of our DNA strands. Once they shorten, the cell is unable to replicate and therefore comes to an end. Following brief, daily meditation sessions, the telomeres of the participant's cells lengthened. In other words, meditation effectively lengthened the life of the cell. If meditation can lengthen your cell's telomeres, then you can probably use this ancient tool to your benefit for just about anything. Here are a few resources to help you start a meditation practice: Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Program Jon Kabat Zinn's book, [Full Catastrophe Living](https://www.amazon.com/Full-Catastrophe-Living-Revised-Illness/dp/0345536932/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1GTHE843XVU5K&dchild=1&keywords=full%20catastrophe%20living&qid=1630077195&sprefix=full%20catastrophe%2Caps%2C576&sr=8-1), illustrates how to use a mindfulness-based stress reduction program to cope with stress, pain, and illness. This book along with any one of the guided meditation CDs or downloads are wonderful resources for anyone getting started. I particularly like the guided body scan sessions which help you tune into areas of tension. Meditation Apps If you want a smartphone option, visit [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com). You can keep track of your progress, the number of new neural pathways created, and other metrics to keep you motivated. You can start with a 7-day free trial or choose a membership plan. The website is a great resource with free educational material and programs for specific conditions such as insomnia or anxiety. Guided Meditation for Fertility & Women's Health [Circle & Bloom](https://circlebloom.com/) is a fertility-specific resource providing clients with guided meditation options for various stages of fertility treatment. Available programs include IVF preparation, improving natural fertility, as well as pregnancy and labor meditations. Circle & Bloom also has programs for those healing from miscarriage or recovering from breast cancer. Mindfulness for Mothers [Buddhism for Mothers](https://www.amazon.com/Buddhism-Mothers-Approach-Yourself-Children/dp/1742373771/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=buddhism%20for%20mothers%20sarah%20napthali&qid=1630075559&sr=8-1) by Sarah Napthali takes a calm approach to caring for yourself and children. The book discusses Buddhist teachings while offering ways to integrate mindfulness into everyday family life. This is a well-researched text (it's about two inches thick) filled with accessible, practical guides for any stage of parenthood. Honest discussions about normal but often conflicting emotions during motherhood offer women a fresh perspective on parenting and self-care. Create a Meditation Space You can simply get started yourself without purchasing a book, program, or any other tool. Find a comfortable and quiet space. Add a yoga mat, folded blanket, or an object to use as a focal point if your mind wanders. While sitting or lying down, place your hands on your lower abdomen. Focus on the rhythm of your breathing. As your body settles in, try slowing your inhalation and exhalation to a count of 4 seconds. If your mind wanders, tell those interrupting thoughts: \"Later\". Continue with the breath work and see where one hundred breaths take you.
