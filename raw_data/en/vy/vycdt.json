They can channel life-force energy helping to unblock areas that have become stuck in a pattern of dis-ease. When we The idea is that crystals can redirect and re-channel energy flow with their unique energetic vibrations, helping to unblock areas of the body or energy field that have become \"stuck.\" They can also act as amplifiers for Reiki healing and help us to concentrate on specific intentions when using a gemstone mala for the practice of Japa Mala. We are left feeling clear, focused and refreshed. Crystals absorb the pressure and movement from the deep layers in the earth where they were formed and convert it into an electronic frequency. Many other medical devices use electronic frequencies in order to promote healing in the body such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), electronic muscle stimulation (EMS), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).
