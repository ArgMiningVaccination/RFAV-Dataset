Principal investigator Sorana Segal-Maurer discusses the promising trial results in this challenging cohort (Interview part 1). There have been myriad advances in [HIV](https://www.contagionlive.com/clinical/hiv-aids) treatment options. Injectable, long-acting HIV therapies, once a pipe dream, are now [approved](https://www.contagionlive.com/view/fda-approves-first-long-acting-injectable-drug-for-hiv) and available. However, treatments for people living with multidrug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are far more limited. People with difficult-to-treat HIV or a history of treatment failure have substantial treatment needs. [Lenacapavir](https://www.contagionlive.com/search?page=1&query=lenacapavir&configure%5Bfilters%5D=pubDateSort%20%3C%3D%201652304342030%20AND%20%22visible%22%3A%27true%27%20AND%20%22passwordLock%22%3Afalse%20AND%20%22type%22%3Aarticle&configure%5BhitsPerPage%5D=25), a first-in-class capsid inhibitor, has potential to fulfill this need. Today, research from the ongoing phase 3 CAPELLA trial was published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Sorana Segal-Maurer, MD, the principal investigator and lead author of the paper, sat down with Contagion to discuss the significance of these results. This significance, Segal-Maurer says, largely stems from the study population, who had \"pretty resistant virus and not a lot of options for its control.\" Of the 72 patients enrolled, 1 in 5 had no fully active antiretrovirals available to them. \"These were deeply multidrug-resistant HIV-infected patients,\" said Segal-Maurer. Additionally, the median age of the study population was 52 years, and the average time of HIV infection was 24 years. Treatment failure was common in this cohort, and Segal-Maurer said most had cycled through at least 9 to 11 antiviral agents. The highly resistant HIV infections in this cohort makes the results all the more remarkable. \"Study results can be very rosy if there's not a lot of disease,\" Segal-Maurer said. \"But if you have terrific results and you have a really challenging population, I really think that speaks to the importance of the results.\" At week 14 of the study, 81% of participants were undetectable with a viral load of less than 50 copies per milliliter. Segal-Maurer notes that this change was sustained through week 26 of the study. As a provider herself, Segal-Maurer highlighted the trial results that may be of great interest to other providers: \"It's good to be undetectable, but we want to see a rise in CD4 cells...that really leads to that decrease in opportunistic infections.\" Segal-Maurer emphasized, \"EVERYONE who had profoundly decreased CD4 cells were able to get past that point, and I find that incredibly meaningful.\" Findings from the CAPELLA trial were [originally presented](https://www.contagionlive.com/view/lenacapvir-offers-a-potential-treatment-option-for-patients-with-multi-drug-resistant-hiv) at the 2021 Annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI). Sorana Segal-Maurer, MD, is Director of Infectious Diseases at New York-Presbyterian Queens and a professor of Clinical Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine. She is the principal site investigator for the study, \"Capsid Inhibition with Lenacapavir in Multidrug-Resistant HIV-1 Infection,\" [published in The New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2115542).
