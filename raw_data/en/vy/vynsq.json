Our application was accepted in June 2021, starting the one-year document submission countdown. Our document will consist of 84 different sources of evidence to support our application and demonstrate that we display the attributes needed for our fourth Magnet Redesignation. Several clinical nurses are participating in our document writing. We are looking for more nurses from every level of experience and practice area to join our Magnet writing teams. Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals Clinical Nurses and Leaders Attend 2021 Magnet Conference A delegation of clinical nurse Nursing Professional Governance (NPG) chairs and nurse leaders attended the 2021 Magnet Conference in Atlanta, GA, in November. This was the first live conference since 2019. The group attend four general sessions which included keynote speaker Carolyn Jones, who has spent the last 10 years interviewing, photographing and filming nurses across the US as part of the American Nurse project. Carolyn also visited Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Center City in December of 2020 to speak to a group of clinical nurses and leaders about the challenges and opportunities that nursing has experienced over the past year. Other speakers at the conference included author and entrepreneur, Josh Linkner and Marcus Engle, whose experience as a patient led to the \"I'm Here Movement\". The annual celebration of newly designated Magnet facilities was another feature of the general sessions. During the concurrent sessions, attendees heard about the successes of other Magnet facilities in ED throughput, research, nurse residency, professional governance, healthy lifestyles, nurse recognition, peer support and more. There was time for fun as well, with the annual Magnet Welcome Party, which was held at the Georgia Aquarium. The Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals group gathered at a southern restaurant for dinner and nurses across Jefferson Health got a chance to meet each other when CNEO, Dr. Kate Fitzpatrick, sponsored a dinner for all at the Hard Rock Cafe. The 2022 conference is at the Philadelphia Convention Center. Many Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals nurses have submitted abstracts and we are hoping some will be accepted for poster and podium presentations!EMPIRICAL OUTCOMES Magnet Redesignation Contributors Jackie Crawford, MS, RN, RN, CNE MISSION We improve lives.

In this year's report, we honor the great accomplishments of our talented nursing staff during another chaotic and turbulent year. As we enter the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, our nurses continue to rise to the challenge and make a difference in the lives of the patients they serve. They have partnered with colleagues, patients and families to fulfill our mission of improving lives. Our nurses continue to put patients first and create caring and innovative patient care delivery systems, while also looking after themselves and their colleagues. We are grateful for them and the many sacrifices they make every day. Our Nursing Professional Governance Board and Unit-Based Councils have worked closely with nursing leaders to create a caring and collaborative culture that focuses on empowering clinical nurses to direct and sustain their own professional practice. Even through unprecedented staffing challenges and collective and personal tragedies, our team has continued to persevere and provide exceptional patient care. In addition, our nursing team continues to volunteer in the community, participate in professional nursing organizations and share nursing research and new knowledge in multiple forums throughout the year. Regardless of the obstacles we have faced along our journey throughout the last year, our staff has remained resilient and continues to be strong as demonstrated by its unwavering presence, strong patient advocacy and continued compassionate care given to the patients we serve. It is my honor and privilege to lead this amazing team and to share a sampling of the outstanding examples of nursing excellence from 2021. I personally want to thank all of our nurses for their extraordinary courage, unwavering dedication and focus on the care of their patients, families and each other during this pandemic. I look forward to 2022 as we maintain our collective strength and welcome the opportunity to showcase our nursing team as we prepare to re-designate our Magnet status for the fourth time.

The world has shifted in ways that we are still coming to understand. Living through a global pandemic, while also caring for others, is indeed a life-altering experience. One constant, amidst the many uncertainties of the past two years, has been the compassion and devotion of our nurses, clinicians and support staff across Jefferson. Collectively, you have courageously faced the daily COVID-19 challenges that have shifted the balance of health care in ways we've never imagined - and still, you rose above, time after time, to put your patients first. Our teams have witnessed significant suffering, unprecedented death and excruciating pain among families who could not be with their loved ones at critical moments. Every one of you has borne witness to the sacred and intimate moments in the lives of others, and on many occasions, have profoundly impacted those needing comfort and compassion. Despite experiencing your own uncertainties and fears, you were there. Every day and in every way. I deeply understand the enormous human toll this has had, as evidenced by the nationwide staffing crisis in health care. My commitment to you is to drive equitable compensation models, support worthwhile and meaningful wellbeing programs - with the proper resourcess - and seek relief for the staffing challenges we continue to face. I know that your voices and perspectives are critically valuable in helping us in our shared commitment to safe, patient-centered care. I will be leveraging nursing governance to hear your concerns and guide decision making in the months ahead, and will also be launching a new, nurse-designed, career ladder that will recognize and reward contributions to quality, safety, as well as your commitment to professional development. I am so honored to serve as a nurse and will continue to be a fierce advocate for each of you, and the patients, families and communities we serve with unparalleled nursing excellence.

Nursing Professional Governance (NPG) is a driving force at Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals. As we continue our journey to becoming a designated Magnet Center of Excellence for the fourth time, putting us in an ultra-elite category, we turn to our clinical nurses for inspiration and leadership. Nurses at Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals own their culture and their practice. Clinical nurses are represented at every level of leadership, from the bedside to the Jefferson Health clinical enterprise. We pride ourselves on the fact that clinical nurse leaders sit at the table with the senior vice presidents and the chief nursing officer, making high-level organizational decisions side by side. One of the most exciting things in 2021 was the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine for Jefferson employees and our patients. The Jefferson Health clinical enterprise had its first Quality Caring Award and each unit was able to submit the name of a nurse that exemplifies excellence in nursing practice. NPG voted to send nurses forward to represent our division for the enterprise award. We have continued to honor our nurses with DAISY Awards\u00ae and unit-based recognition. Nurses Week 2021 was virtual and we had a lot of fun with our gift basket giveaway. As the pandemic continued, some restrictions were lifted so we got to attend the Magnet Conference in Atlanta. NPG is about each and every one of you, which is why we developed our monthly newsletter to keep everyone informed. We have experienced loss and have seen the resiliency and strength of our colleagues. I want to thank all of you for allowing me and the other council chairs to represent you. We could not be more proud to say we are Jefferson Nurses. Join me in reading about our impressive accomplishments in 2021 and look out for even greater success in 2022!

Thank you for your leadership! 6 Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals | 2021 Nursing Annual Report Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals | 2021 Nursing Annual Report 9In February 2021, Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals' new NPG Model was implemented after ample input and revisions from over 123 clinical nurses, advanced practice nurses and nurse leaders. The shared governance redesign committee refined all of the ideas from these stakeholders. The model consists of a coordinating council, three global councils and unit councils. The three global councils are The Nurse Well- being Council, The Nursing Professional Development Council, Evidence Based Practice and Research Council and The Quality, Safety and Informatics Council. The nursing interprofessional committees also partner with the NPG councils to focus on improving nurse-sensitive indicators to optimize patient outcomes. Kimberli Keane-Norcross, BSN, RN, coordinator of patient care services, ICN, was the winner of the NPG schematic design, which depicts our NPG Model. In the past year, the NPG councils influenced nurse wellness and recognition activities, participated in nursing professional development offerings and collaborated with patients, families and colleagues to improve patient outcomes. The Wellness Global Council focused on wellness resources available to support our clinical nurses during these difficult months. Peer support resources found in Tier 3 of Jefferson's Wellbeing Support Pyramid, such as RISE, SOS and Nurse2Nurse, were presented to the group. Furthermore, the council welcomed Nurse2Nurse leaders to facilitate a live support session, allowing members to experience the services firsthand and promote the resources on their home units. NPG empowers clinical nurses to use their knowledge to direct and sustain their own professional practice. Its aim is to harness the expertise of the bedside clinical nurse. We know that a culture of professional governance results in improved patient safety, quality of care and nurse satisfaction. Nurses at Jefferson improve patient outcomes across the care continuum and enhance their professional well-being and interprofessional collaboration by participating in NPG. Many thanks to our 2021 clinical nurse NPG chairs for representing their peers and partnering with colleagues across the enterprise to improve and enhance patient care delivery systems and the nursing work environment.

Since the NRP's inception, approximately 1,600 nurses have participated in the 12-month residency program. The 2019 one-year turnover rate for Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals nurse residents is 2.55%, below the benchmark of 9.7% for all Vizient AACN NRP participants. In 2018, Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals was honored to receive CCNE accreditation. The COVID-19 pandemic challenged NRP leadership to think differently, yet continue to offer the NRP during a chaotic time. Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals decided to pause NRP for April 2020. Once a new delivery method was identified, NRP seminars resumed and Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals continued providing the Vizient NRP to eligible new-to-practice nurses. The NRP curriculum builds upon pre-licensure education to supply the knowledge, skills and support necessary to transition from advanced beginner to competent nurse. In the last three years, residents' completion rate ranged from 80-90%. All nurse residents complete a group Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) project and in 2021, 32 projects were presented to internal nursing audiences. Two of the 2021 presentations have been accepted at national conferences. 2021 NRP Nurse Presenters Luise Weber, Hannah Egnaczyk, BSN, RN, ED Dustin RN, B2 3CTitle of Presentation Impact of Specialized Inpatient Diabetes Education on 30-Day Readmission Rates Clinically Indicted Peripheral IV Catheter Change Strengthening the Clinical Nurses Through the Practice of Mindfulness Presented at Vizient National Conference September 8th, 2021 Reducing Falls in the Elderly Population EBP: Strategies to Improve Nursing Wellness Ventriculitis Mindfulness Breathing Techniques in Nursing 2021 NRP Nurse Presenters Losongco, RN, Sarah Dawson, BSN, 6 Jake RN, JHN 7 Sarah Buchhofer, 7CTitle of Presentation Evaluating How the Use of a Standardized Checklist Impacts Post Anesthesia Care Unit Handoff Prevention of HAI in Neutropenic Patients The Effect of Recognition on Nursing Unit Morale To be presented at Vizient 2022 Conference March 1st, 2022 Fall Prevention on B4: Reinventing the Change of Shift Huddle Implementation of Unit-Specific Tip Sheets for Pool Nurses Implementing Pre-op Edu for ENT Free Flap Patients in Order to Reduce Hospital Readmission Rates End of Life Care Improving Hospital-Acquired Delirium in Neuro Patients: A Nurse Residency Project Temperature Regulation in the Neonate Fall Prevention EBP ProjectSTRUCTURAL EMPOWERMENT 12 Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals | 2021 Nursing Annual Report Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals | 2021 Nursing Annual Report 13 2021 NRP Nurse Presenters BSN, RN, 3C Louis Training Inpatient Units: An Evidence-Based Practice Project Implementing Early Ambulation for Post-op Patients to Decrease Length of Stay Implementation of a 1-4 Acuity Tool Submitted Change of Shift Report: Implementation of EPIC Nursing Handoff Driveline Infections and The Impact of Nurses The Effect of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Practices on Nursing Stress and Burnout During a Pandemic: An Evidence-Based Literature Review Education Increases Nursing Confidence in Preventing Unintentional Needlestick Injuries The Impact of Oncology Education on Nurses Perceived Comfort Level in Caring for Oncology Patients CHG Treatment Craniotomy Infection Prevention: Investigating Nursing Competence and Confidence How Does Incorporating 1-5 Minutes of Mindfulness Exercises Effect Levels of Stress in Acute Care Nurses? 2021 NRP Nurse Presenters Samantha Zive, of Presentation Improving the Education of iCOUGH for Medical-Surgical Nurses Restrictions on Implementing Bedside Handoff Nursing Satisfaction: Impact of a Patient Acuity Tool Peripheral IV Site Rotation14 Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals | 2021 Nursing Annual ReportSTRUCTURAL EMPOWERMENT Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals | 2021 Nursing Annual Report 15J. Patrick Barnes died at the age of 33 in late 1999 from complications of Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP), a little known but not uncommon auto-immune disease. The care Patrick and his family received from nurses while he was ill inspired a unique means of thanking nurses for making a profound difference in the lives of their patients and patient's families.The DAISY Award honors a registered nurse each month who exemplifies these caring behaviors. The honoree exhibits exceptional qualities and attributes that reflect the kind of professionalism and skills we value at Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals. Once a year, advanced practice nurses and nurse managers are also recognized with DAISY Awards. Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals also offers the DAISY Team Award, which was created by our nursing team in 2012 and is now an official award administered by the DAISY foundation. This award recognizes that while an idea to achieve better family outcomes may start with one individual, it often takes an entire team to implement it successfully. The DAISY Team award is designed to honor collaboration by two or more people, led by a nurse, who identify and meet patient and/or patient family needs by going above and beyond the traditional role of nursing.

In Pennsylvania, only seven units received gold-level designation last year. The award demonstrates another milestone in the ACE Unit's journey on the path to exceptional patient care and healthy work environments. The unit earned a silver-level Beacon Award for Excellence in 2017. The Beacon Award for Excellence recognizes unit caregivers who successfully improve patient outcomes and align practices with AACN's six Healthy Work Environment Standards. Units that achieve this three-year, three-level designation with a gold, silver or bronze designation meet national criteria consistent with Magnet Recognition, the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award and the National Quality Healthcare Award. Jefferson Methodist Hospital's B1 ACE Unit also received the Choosing Wisely Trailblazer Award from the Nurses Improving Care for Health System Elders (NICHE) and the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) as recognition for improving care for older adults in one of the clinical areas identified by the American Academy of Nursing's Choosing Wisely recommendations. The leadership team submitted the award nomination: Kristin Swartz, MD, ACE unit medical director; Lori Belcher, MSN, RN, nurse manager; David Dacanay, MSN, Kelly BSN, RN, coordinator PCS; and Lisa Cassia, MSN, RN, clinical practice leader. The award highlighted the collaborative effort of nursing and ancillary staff, medical team, physical therapy and unit leadership in providing quality care for older adults by increasing patient mobility, thus enhancing independence, improving quality of life and shortening length of stay. The Choosing Wisely Trailblazer Award was created to celebrate leadership in improving quality care with a mission to educate front-line nurses and position nurses as leaders. The NICHE works to advance systemic change to promote age-friendly health care. Similarly, the ABIM Foundation leads a national initiative to promote evidence-based medicine, encouraging clinicians and patients to engage in conversations about care where the risk outweighs the benefits.ACE Unit at Methodist Receives Gold Beacon Award for Excellence and the Choosing Wisely Trailblazer AwardB5 Med-Surg Unit Receives PRISM Award Congratulations to our B5 Medical-Surgical Unit at Jefferson Methodist Hospital, recipient of the Academy of Medical- Surgical Nurses (AMSN) PRISM Award\u00ae, an honor the Academy notes as the premier recognition in the specialty of medical- surgical nursing.

She has served countless patients in her tenure as a trauma injury prevention outreach coordinator and administrative supervisor at Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals. She has worked to soothe grieving families as a liaison with Mothers Bonded by Grief. She has aided survivors of human trafficking through her work with Villanova University's Law Institute to Address Commercial Exploitation - work she was motivated to tackle after a trip to Latin America, in which she learned that some young women with whom she had become friendly had fallen prey to human traffickers. Working as part of a team, she has operationalized the Institute's pioneering approach into a powerful education program for Jefferson Health staff who may encounter victims of trafficking. The program focuses on early identification - how to spot a trafficking victim and how to help them in a small window of time. Nora's volunteer work as an intake nurse at a clinic in North Philadelphia allows her to advocate for marginalized commu- nities seeking treatment. She is also committed to the reduction of geriatric falls. Nora is a certified SAIL Instructor (Stay Active and Independent for Life) and provides education to senior groups at churches, libraries and community centers to help seniors prevent falls. It is no surprise, then, that her efforts to help others have been rewarded. She is a recipient of the 2021 Compassionate Caregiver of the Year Award from the Schwartz Center for Compassionate Healthcare and the American Trauma Society (Pennsylvania Division) Recognition Award. Since 1999, the Schwartz Center for Compassionate Health- care has honored outstanding healthcare professionals who display extraordinary devotion and compassion in caring for patients and families. The National Compassionate Caregivers of the Year Award recognizes extraordinary healthcare professionals from across the country whose professional achievements have helped to create healing healthcare environments for patients, families, colleagues and communities. Nora was honored at an awards ceremony on November 4, 2021. Supporting the Work of the Schwartz Center for Compassion- ate Healthcare for more than 10 years, Jefferson has been a member institution of the Schwartz Center for Compassion- ate Healthcare and conducts Schwartz Center Rounds the fourth Wednesday of each month at noon to provide a confidential environment where providers from diverse disciplines discuss difficult emotional and social issues that arise in caring for patients in order to support the healing process and advance compassionate care. Nora Kramer, RN, MS, CNRN, Named Compassionate Caregiver of the Year 28 Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals | 2021 Nursing Annual Report Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals | 2021 Nursing Annual Report 29The Jefferson Nurse Professional Practice Model Nursing Professional Practice at Jefferson Health is based on the Quality Caring\u00a9 Model (QCM) developed by nursing theorist Joanne Duffy, PhD. In early 2021, this model was re-introduced to all nurses at Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals. The model was created with input from Jefferson nurses across the enterprise in July of 2019. This model combines the art and science of nursing and stresses the equal importance of both. With a focus on both quality and caring, the QCM provides nurses with a tangible foundation to build their practice and embed caring into the healthcare environment. The model places relationships at the core of the nursing process: relationships with patients/ families, colleagues, self and community. These caring relationships, combined with evidence-based practice, empower nurses to foster cohesive teams and promote quality care. This conceptual approach allows individuals to feel cared for and cultivates an environment of collaboration. The Jefferson Nurse Professional Practice Model is aligned with the mission, vision and values of Jefferson Health, and provides a framework for our nurses to serve as patient advocates, putting the patient and family at the center of our work. We strive to improve the lives of those we touch each day.

These awards align with the new Professional Practice Model (PPM) that provides all Jefferson Health nurses with a tangible foundation to build their practice and embed caring into the healthcare environment. The new PPM model is based on the Quality Caring Model (QCM) developed by nursing theorist Joanne Duffy, PhD. In order to be nominated for the Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals Quality Caring Award, clinical nurses must display one or more of the following caring behaviors as described below: Mutual Problem Solving: Assists patients and caregivers to understand, learn and think about their health and illness, and promotes their active engagement in decision-making regarding their care. Attentive Reassurance: Being attentive to the patient and present in the moment. Human Respect: Value all individuals through unconditional acceptance, care with dignity, and recognition of individual rights and responsibilities.

Campbell Awards during Nurses Week 2021Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals | 2021 Nursing Annual Report 33EXEMPLARY PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE 32 Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals | 2021 Nursing Annual ReportIn response to the ongoing surges of COVID-19 , we focused our efforts on vaccination and testing services as a community- driven approach within the Philadelphia region. Vaccine administration has always been at the forefront of public health service that delivers preventive measures, especially to vulnerable members of the community. Testing services, meanwhile, provide immediate determination of infection status to prevent disease spread. As part of Jefferson's value of putting people first, the mitigation efforts supporting vaccine and testing services address community health outreach initiatives the organization is committed to upholding. The Mobile COVID-19 Clinic was conceived as a response to the needs of the underserved and medically vulnerable members of the community who may not have equitable access to vaccines or testing. The clinic offers a no-cost COVID-19 community vaccination and testing program because of its partnership with Philadelphia's Department of Public Health through Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding provided to Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals. This public health community service effort is a partnership between our emergency medicine physicians, pharmacists and Emergency Department nurses and staff who volunteered time above their regular hours. Jeff Temp staff were also hired to assist with this endeavor. Initially, the Mobile COVID-19 Clinic started its operations in October 2020 as a testing site at St. Raymond's of Penafort Church in Stenton and Richard Allen Preparatory Charter School in Southwest Philadelphia. In May 2021, the mobile clinic began administering vaccines at the Universal Bluford Charter School in West Philadelphia and the Wyss Jefferson Clinic, South Philadelphia. Due to the community's varying needs, both the vaccine and testing clinic also operated at various locations within the city, including parks, schools, marketplaces and street festivals. In addition, the mobile clinic partnered with PhilaVax and several LatinX organizations to offer vaccinations and testing at various sites throughout the city. Thanks to the many volunteers who provided their services to the Mobile COVID-19 Clinic: Ellyn Taylor, MSN, MBA, RN, CEN, administrative supervisor, TJUH ED; Jennifer Bohn-Wargny, MSN, MBA, RN, CEN, administrative Medicine; Esmihan Almontaser, PhD, RN, CPAN, clinical educator and quality assurance manager, who served as lead and directed activities in the Mobile COVID-19 Clinic. Several others volunteered from the Department of Nursing including: Caroline Christiansen, BSN, JMH ED; JMH; Kimberly Trumbull, RN, Jefferson Abington Hospital. In addition, several nurse practitioners and physician assistants also worked at the site: Anna Boccardo, PA; MSN, CRNPFH; Lindsey Wolf, MSN, CRNP.The Mobile COVID-19 Clinic 34 Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals | 2021 Nursing Annual ReportThomas Jefferson University Hospitals developed a peer support program for healthcare providers in inpatient and outpatient settings as part of a comprehensive strategy to support clinician wellness, psychological health and safety. The program, co-led by Deborah Gardiner, MSN, RN, CCCTM and Colleen Callahan, MSN, RN-BC, CCCTM, NP-C, went live on February 1, 2021. Following a lessons-learned analysis, the program was expanded across Jefferson Health in the spring of 2021. The goal of the RISE (Resilience In Stressful Events) program is to provide timely psychological first aid and emotional support to health care providers who encounter a traumatic medical event and are in need of support. Modeled after peer support programs at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Jefferson Abington Hospital, Carilion Medical Center and the University of Missouri, the Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals RISE program was developed specifically to meet the needs of healthcare providers who experience what has been called the \"second victim\" phenomenon. Second victims are healthcare providers who are involved in an unanticipated adverse patient event, medical error and/or a patient related injury and become victimized in the sense that the provider is traumatized by the event (Scott, 2009). The philosophy behind peer support is rooted in a trusting relationship between a provider who is struggling to find understanding and assistance, and a peer supporter who assists in working through the issue and models a sense of hope. The Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals RISE team is composed of nurses and other healthcare providers who volunteer to provide emotional support and psychological first aid. Members are required to complete training in how to administer psychological first aid and are encouraged to participate in an ongoing education program that includes RISE monthly meetings, RISE encounter simulations and hospital wellness lectures. There are 50 nurses and other clinicians that were trained to volunteer in the program and in 2021, the program counseled 100 clinical employees at Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals. RISE Program Provides Emotional Support to Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals Clinicians Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals | 2021 Nursing Annual Report 35EXEMPLARY PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE Nurse Satisfaction Survey - October 2020 Our fourth Magnet Redesignation document will be submitted soon. The 2020 Nursing Satisfaction Survey will be submitted with this document. In October 2020, during the first year of the global pandemic, Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals nurses participated in the 2020 National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators (NDNQI\u00ae) RN Survey with Practice Environment Scale (PES) and Magnet Module Survey. The overall participation rate was 91% and clinical nurses who spent the majority of their time in direct patient care were eligible to participate in the survey. The survey evaluated various areas recognized by Magnet including, but not limited to: Staffing and Resource Adequacy (Adequacy of resources and staffing) Autonomy Nurse-Nurse Interaction (RN-to RN teamwork and collaboration) Interprofessional Relationships Survey results were compared against a variety of NDNQI\u00ae benchmarks including Academic Medical Centers Mean (AMC), Teaching Facilities Mean (TF), All Hospitals Mean (All Hosp.), Bed Size 500 Mean (BS>500) and Bed Size to 500. The results offered nurses' perspectives in these various categories. Magnet requires hospitals to choose four of seven domains included in the survey and to exceed the chosen benchmark a majority of the time in a majority of the survey areas. Overall Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals outperformed the benchmarks in the above four categories. At a time when hospitals nationally and globally are struggling to survive the impact of the pandemic, these results are especially encouraging. They demonstrate Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals' commitment to creating and sustaining a work environment where nurses feel valued and supported. 36 Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals | 2021 Nursing Annual Report Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals | 2021 Nursing Annual Report 37Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals Nursing Professional Development was able to continue offering quality nursing continuing professional development during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Virtual Learning Environment was utilized for Grand Rounds starting in September 2020 and Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals continued this innovative practice in 2021. Programs are recorded and many of our live programs are now stored as continuing education in myJeffHub.The virtual environment has been a huge benefit for this program because many nationally recognized nursing leaders were able to easily share their knowledge with Jefferson nurses. It also allowed our colleagues from across the Jefferson Health enterprise to attend Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals Grand Rounds.
