Prevention and Treatment 57 Focus on Developing New Medications for Alcoholism 67 Epilog 726 ill FOREWORD The importance of research on alcoholabuse and alcoholism is unmistakablein light of the substantial harm andcosts that result from these disorders.The debilitating effects of alcohol onthe physical and social well-being ofproblem drinkers, the far-reachingharm that drinking causes in our com-munities, the related costs borne byindividuals and society alikeeach ofthese consequences affirms the needfor greater knowledge about whatcauses alcoholism, how it can be pre-vented, andonce a drinking prob-lem developshow it can be treatedeffectively. Such knowledge will comeonly from research.Over the past 20 years, alcoholresearchers have made intensiveefforts to understand alcohol use andits outcomes. During this time, thealcohol research field has developedfrom relatively modest beginnings tobecome one of the most rapidly grow-ing areas of scientific investigation. Todate, alcohol researchers have mademuch progress toward understandingthe causes and consequences of alco-holism and its related problems.As we move toward the beginningof a new century, alcohol research hasa preeminent goal:to gather knowl-edge that will enhance the develop-.:..=!nt of methods to prevent and totreat ale- iol use disorders.Developing new medications toadvance alcoholism treatment is criti-cal to this process. As part of the con-tinuing pursuit of enhanced treat-ment measures, researchers now areextending the search to include newpharmacotherapies that target themechanisms of the addiction itself.Scientists are armed in this questwith increasing knowledge about thebrain processes underlying addiction.The discovery of new medicationswill offer fresh hope to those whostruggle to achieve and maintainlong-term sobriety. Some of these new drugs may ease the intense crav-ing for alcohol experienced by manyrecently abstinent alcoholics orimprove alcohol-induced cognitiveimpairments that can affect a patient'spotential to benefit from traditionaltherapies.It is unlikely that a single agentwill be developed to treat this com-plex disease. However, couplingpharmacotherapies that control spe-cific clinical events in the diseasecourse with traditional behavioraland verbal therapies will enhancetreatment outcome immeasurably.Refined therapies will benefitmany people. For alcohol dependentindividuals, who face the realistic fearof relapse to drinking, improved inter-ventions can abateand, optimally,preventrelapse occurrences and haltcontinuing disease that ultimately canlead to death. For society, which car-ries the weight of the enormous eco-nomic and social costs of problemdrinking, improved treatment strate-gies that heighten the potential forlong-term abstinence can lessen thisburden and enhance overall quality oflife. New therapies promise to reducethe billions of dollars lost annuallyfrom reduced workplace productivity,alcohol-related injuries and illnesses,and alcohol-related premature deaths.Furthermore, more effective treatmentcan reduce the frequency the vari-ous social tragediesmotor vehiclecrashes, falls, drownings, fires andburns, crime and family violencethat are associated with alcoholmisuse.While studies of the causes, pre-vention, and treatment of alcoholaddiction are critical, investigations ofthe medical consequences of alco-holism continue to be key componentsin the research agenda. The severe dis-orders that develop from alcohol'sdamage to the body are responsiblefor great suffering and contribute sub-stantially to the high cost of healthAlcohol Research: Promise for the Decade care among alcoholic patients. Yet, sci-entists have observed that thesepathologies are not distributed equallythroughout the alcoholic population.Recent studies suggest that differentunderlying genetic factors in peopleexposed to high levels of alcohol maybe responsible for the development ofsuch disorders as fetal alcohol syn-drome, liver cirrhosis, and Wernicke-Korsakoff s syndrome.Future studies potentially canidentify physiological bases forgenetic susceptibility to alcohol-relatedpathologies. Such knowledge canhelp scientists to develop specifictechniques to prevent the onset ofalcohol-related illnesses. In addition,this knowledge can enable cliniciansto identify individuals at risk fordeveloping these disorders, allowingfor early identification of alcohol-related pathologies. Finally, knowl-edge of the etiologies of genetically-influenced consequences can aug-ment efforts to generate more effec-tive therapies for such disorders.Ultimately, these advances can effectlarge reductions in health care costsand save countless lives.Two primary prerequisites must bemet to accomplish the fundamentalgoals of alcohol research. First andforemost, the alcohol field needs theabiding efforts of talented cliniciansand researchers who, through comple-mentary endeavors, link researchadvances and treatment practice.Second, the production of techniquesand technologies that allow for theobservation and evaluation of rele-vant phenomena are vital to researchprogress.Animal models are a principalexample of techniques needed in thecoming decade of alcohol research.Developing models with correlate fea-tures of the human disease, such ascraving or tolerance, will enable scien-tists to probe the biochemical andphysiological mechanisms underlying vithese features. In turn, the animalmodels can serve as fundamentaltools for developing and assessingtreatment measures for the variouselements of alcoholism.As one of the first steps in medica-tions development, animal studies canensure that further tests can be con-ducted in humans without danger.Nonetheless, animal studies alonecannot confirm the efficacy of poten-tial pharmacological therapies in alco-holism treatment. Clinical trials ofnew pharmacotherapies are indis-pensable for determining dose, effica-cy, and safety of medications inhumans. Such trials will serve as inte-gral tools for developing new medica-tions for alcoholism treatment.Advances in technology also willenhance the research efforts in thenext 10 years. During the past decade,a number offer scientists theunprecedented and exciting opportu-nity to look inside the living brainwithout invading the brain. In thecoming decade, alcohol researcherswill be able to apply these powerfulresources to probe the actions of alco-hol on the biochemistry and physiolo-gy of the living brain.Imaging studies are likely to revealcritical knowledge about the brainmechanisms involved in the funda-mental components of alcohol addic-tion. In addition, by allowing theopportunity to view the possiblechanges in the brain that precede theonset of symptoms, imaging technolo-gy will contribute much to thedevelopment of successful preventionmeasures. These tools eventually maybe used in conjunction with treatmentresearch and practice, enablingresearchers to observe the alterationsin brain physiology that occur in response to various behavioral andpharmacological treatments.At present, the scarcity of imagingtechnology frequently restricts its usein many laboratory and clinical alco-hol studies. Given the potential valueof this technology in alcohol research,the alcohol research communityincreasingly will turn to these newtools and apply strategies that willfoster their efficient use.The research areas highlightedhere are just a few of the many excit-ing components of alcohol research.Alcohol Research: Promise for the Decadepresents the established findings thatserve as foundations for futureresearch and highlights the com-pelling areas for the coming decadethat promise to advance understand-ing of the nature of alcoholism andpromote efforts to prevent and treatthe disease. This document attemptsto convey the great spirit and promiseof alcohol research. From the discus-sion of the health, social, and economicconsequences of alcohol abuse andalcoholism that motivate the study ofalcohol-related problems, to the pre-sentation of new research conceptsand technologies that enhance the sys-tematic analysis of those problems,this document testifies to the ability ofalcohol researchers ultimately toresolve one of our country's foremostpublic health problems. Enoch Gordis, M.D.DirectorNational Institute on AlcoholAbuse and AlcoholismForeword vii Alcohol Research: Promise for the Decade ACKNOWLEDGMENTS It is always easier to look backwardand record what has happened thanto look forward and authoritativelydescribe what can be.

Ii ix IALCOHOL ABUSEAND ALCOHOLISM What are alcohol abuse and alcoholism?Although many adults drink with few, ifany, problems, others experience a num-ber of adverse consequences from drink-ing. Even isolated episodes of alcoholmisuse may result in such tragic conse-quences as alcohol poisoning and injuryor death from alcohol-impaired drivingand other accidents. When alcohol prob-lems persist over time, however, theyare classified as one of two clinical disor-ders: alcohol abuse or alcoholism.Today, alcoholism is recognized asa disease characterized by abnormalalcohol-seeking behavior that resultsin impaired control over drinking.Variously termed \"alcohol addiction,\" and\"alcoholism\" over the years, this dis-ease has four main clinical features:craving, impaired control over drink-ing, physical dependence, and toler-ance. These are the key elements ofwhat has been termed the \"alcoholdependence syndrome.\"Physicians long have witnessed thereality of craving in recovering patientsfor whom the notion of having a drinkbecomes overwhelming and preoccupy-ing, impossible to ignore. This cravingfor alcohola drug hungeroftenoccurs in recently abstinent alcoholicsand is an important determinant ofrelapse to drinking. The basis of this crit-ical element of alcoholism has not beendetermined. Some researchers suggestthat it is an appetitive urge, similar tohunger, with a physiological founda-tion. Others submit that the desire todrink is a behavioral response to envi-ronmental triggers. Recent researchdemonstrating that alcoholics displaynumerous physical responses whenexposed to alcohol suggests that crav-ing, indeed, has a physical basis.Whereas craving refers to thehunger for alcohol before drinkingbegins, impaired control over drinkingrefers to the difficulty that an alcoholicexperiences in stopping once drinking13 1Alcohol abuse and alcoholism are clini-cal disorders that affect millions ofAmericans of every age, race, and sex.Although these disorders cost our soci-ety billions of dollars annually, thehuman costs are immeasurable.Photographs courtesy of Lloyd Wolfe. has started. Unlike nonproblemdrinkers, alcoholics may lack internalsignals that would allow them to regu-late alcohol intake.Physical dependence is an adaptivestate manifested by intense physicaldisturbances that occur when drinkingis discontinued. A consequence ofchronic alcohol use, physical depen-dence results from the adaptation ofcentral nervous system structures andfunctions (and probably those of otherorgans) to the presence of alcohol.Dependence necessitates continueddrinking to prevent alcohol withdrawalsyndrome, a host of symptoms rangingfrom profound anxiety, tremulousness(\"the shakes\"), intense hyperactivity,and sleep disturbances, to hallucina-tions and seizures. The intensity of suchsymptoms reflects the level of physio-logical dependence on alcohol.During withdrawal, some alcoholicsexperience only mild symptoms, where-as others endure extremely severe reac-tions that can be life-threatening.Whether mild or severe, these symp-toms can prompt a return to drinking torelieve the discomfort. Thus, it is impor-tant to control the more severe with-drawal reactions in alcoholics who arebeginning abstinence. Recent evidencesuggests that repeated untreated with-drawals from alcohol may have a cumu-lative brain-damaging effect, possiblyleading to more serious withdrawalepisodes in the future.An individual who drinks heavilyover a period of months or years gradu-ally develops an ability to consumeincreasing amounts of alcohol withoutshowing gross signs of intoxication. Thisphenomenon, called tolerance, often ismistaken to be a sign of resistance to theadverse consequences of heavy drink-ing. Actually, the tolerance to alcoholthat occurs after chronic heavy drinkingis indicative of long-lasting changes pro-duced by alcohol. Tolerance allows indi-viduals to maintain higher blood alcoholconcentrations without appearing intox-Alcohol Research: Promise for the Decade icated; yet, many aspects of brain func-tioning are impaired and vital organsmay be damaged.Any drinking that produces a prob-lem, whether social or medical, mild orsevere, is important. \"Alcohol abuse\"refers to problem drinkingshort of thealcohol \"Problem drinking\"and \"nondependent alcohol abuse\" areadditional terms that have been used todescribe this problematic use of alcohol.While alcohol abusers are not depen-dent on alcohol, they nonetheless mayexperience social and medical problemsas a result of poor judgment or uncon-cern about the adverse consequences oftheir drinking.Problems caused by even occasionaldrinking episodes (such as an isolatedalcohol-related traffic crash or a fallwhile intoxicated) can be serious orfatal. Continuous heavy drinking canprovoke more severe social problems,such as divorce and other family prob-lems, and economic problems, such asjob loss. In addition, such serious med-ical consequences as liver cirrhosis,memory loss, stroke, heart damage,and cancer may occur.Although alcohol abusers and alco-holics suffer from many of the samehealth, social, and economic problems,dependence on alcohol and theimpaired ability to control alcohol intakethat characterize alcoholism distinguishthe two disorders. Social use does notinevitably progress to alcohol abuse orto alcoholism. Rather, over the course oftime, persons who abuse alcohol canbecome social users or abstainers later inlife; those who abstain in their youth oryoung adulthood may become alcoholabusers as they age. Further, an individ-ual can be an alcohol abuser withoutbeing alcoholic, or can be alcoholicbefore displaying alcohol-related socialand medical problems. 214THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEMMore Americans use alcohol than anyother drug, including cigarette tobacco.According to national surveys, approxi-mately two-thirds of all adults in theUnited States drink alcoholic beverages.Of individuals who drink, one-half arelight drinkers and one-half are moderateto heavy drinkers. However, some indi-viduals drink far more than others; the10 percent of those who drink mostheavily account for fully one-half of allalcohol consumed in this country.More men than women drink, andmore men than women are heavydrinkers. White Americans are morelikely to use alcohol than African-Americans, American Indians, andAsian Americans. Nonetheless, with theexception of Asian Americans, membersof U.S. minority groups suffer to agreater extent from alcohol-related prob-lems than do white Americans. Forexample, among men and women, non-white individuals experience higherdeath rates than white individuals fromalcoholic cirrhosis. Among the homelesspopulation, it is estimated that 20 to 45percent suffer from alcohol problems.During the 1980s, alcohol use by highschool seniors began a welcome, thoughgradual, downward trend. Yet, alcoholuse among young people is still alarm-ingly high. In 1990, 32 percent of highschool seniors reported having five ormore consecutive drinks on a singleoccasion during the 2-week period priorto the survey. CONSEQUENCES OFALCOHOL USE Alcohol use may lead to social conse-quences that often affect not only thedrinker but also family, friends, andstrangers. For example, alcohol can playan important role in accidents, includingfalls and motor vehicle crashes. The seri-ousness of this issue is reflected in acci- dent statistics: Accidents account for themajority of deaths among peoplebetween the ages of 5 and 34 years in theUnited States. Over one-half of thesedeaths are due to traffic accidents, andalcohol has been implicated in recentyears in about one-half of the estimated46,000 annual traffic deaths.The percentage of teenagers who diein traffic accidents continues to be a mat-ter of public concern. Approximately 40percent of all teenage deaths each yearresult from traffic crashes. Yet, evidencesuggests that alcohol may be decreasingas a factor in teenage traffic crashes.From 1982 through 1988, the percentageof teenage drivers who were intoxicatedin fatal crashes decreased by 36 percent.Although this trend is encouraging, alco-hol is involved in a substantially greaternumber of fatal crashes among teenagedrivers than among other age groups.It is estimated that alcohol is a factorin approximately 30 percent of all sui-cides and, in particular, that alcohol useis prevalent among adolescents whocommitsuicide.Inonestudy,researchers found that, between 1978and 1983, 46 percent of adolescents whotook their own lives had been drinkingjust before committing their final act.Alcohol also appears to play a significantrole in suicides that are impulsive ratherthan premeditated. The use of alcohol ispredominant among suicide victimswho used firearms to take their lives.In the United States, the social andeconomic toll of alcohol abuse and alco-holism far exceeds the toll of many othercontemporary medical and social prob-lems. Alcohol abuse and alcohol depen-dence affect about 10 percent of adultAmericans. Heavy alcohol use con-tributes to medical problems; one studyfound that an estimated 25 percent of allpersons admitted to general hospitalbeds screened positively for alcoholism.Further, the social costs of alcohol prob-lems match the high economic costs.Virtually every organ (for example,liver, pancreas, heart, and brain) andChapter I every system (for example, gastrointesti-nal, reproductive, and endocrine) in thehuman body can be damaged by chronicdrinking. The damage can lead to a vari-ety of diseases and other health prob-lems. These medical consequences ofalcohol abuse and alcoholism areresponsible for a significant amount ofillness in the United States and result inat least 40,000 deaths annually.Alcohol abuse and alcoholism arecostly. For 1985, the total economic costof alcohol abuse and alcoholism wasestimated at $70.3 billion; this estimatewas projected to $85.8 billion for 1988.Of the projected 1988 total, $33.0 billion(38.4 percent) was due to lost employ-ment and reduced productivity (anindirect cost that is difficult to measure)and $28.5 billion (33.2 percent) was dueto premature mortality. The projectedcost of treatment and associatedresearch, training, and other supportiveactivities was relatively low: $8.7 billion(10.2 percent).On the average, health care costs foruntreated alcoholics are at least 100 per-cent greater than those for nonalco-holics. Alternatively, treating alco-holism reduces general health care costs.One study reported that the averagemonthly health care costs for an alco-holic's family were 50 to 90 percentlower following treatment of the alco-holic family member.Why study alcohol use? Because bystudying alcohol use, we can learn howto prevent alcohol abuse and alco-holism and how to minimize theireffects when they do occur. In turn, bylearning how to control alcohol abuseand alcoholism, we can decrease healthcare costs and reduce the incidence ofheart disease, cancer, liver disease, acci-dental injuries, suicide, crime, and vio-lence. In short, by studying alcohol use,we can make a difference. 153 CorpuscallosumCerebralhemisphere 0 Pons MedullaSpinalcordMidbrain Clinicians long have been aware ofthe myriad medical consequencesthat can develop from alcohol use.Liver disease, pancreatitis, anddegenerative changes in heart andmuscle are all examples of alcohol-induced damage. Yet, the effects ofalcohol that produce intoxication,reinforcement of continued drinking,and the features of the diseaseprocess of alcoholism are based prin-cipally in the brain.Neuroscience is the field of studythat focuses on the structure andactivities of the brain. Throughresearch in this field, we have cometo learn that the brain governs a hostof basic responses such as fear andpain, hunger and thirst. Moreover, itis the seat of all that is humanthinking, abstracting, emotions, plan-ning for the future, and memories ofthe past.It is not surprising that neuro-science is an especially importantarea of investigation for alcoholresearchers. Alcoholism appears toinvolve changes in mood, behavior,and possibly appetite, all of whicharegovernedbythebrain.Accordingly, neuroscience researchprovides essential information in thesearch for why some people whodrink become addicted to alcoholand how alcohol damages normalbrain functions.Researchers have identified manyof the fundamental questions con-cerning the effects of alcohol on thebrain, and new research methods andtechnologies are becoming availableevery day to advance our search foranswers. Neuroscience researchpromises to propel us through thenext decade to excitingand inmany ways unprecedentedage ofdiscovery about the activities andfunctions of the brain and their rolein alcohol abuse and alcoholism. 5The ways in which alcohol affects dif-ferent types of nerve cells in differentparts of the brain are just beginning tobe understood.

Functioningbasically as a communication center,its highly organized systems controlthinking and feeling, process infor-mation from the senses, guide mus-cular movement, and regulate bodyfunctions.Nerve cells, or neurons, are thebasic units of the brain and nervoussystem. Although their structure issimilar to that of other cells, neuronsare specialized to communicate bytransmitting messages. Some nervecells outside the brainin particularthe sensory neurons of the eyes, ears,nose, tongue, and skingeneratesignals in response to such externalstimuli as light and sound; otherstransmit signals that control muscleactivity. The neurons of the brainreceive information from the sensoryorgans, send messages that controlAlcohol Research: Promise for the Decade the muscles in body movement, andgenerate thoughts, feelings, andactions.Throughout the brain, each of thebillions of neurons makes as many asthousands of connections with itsneighbors. As the brain controlsthoughts and behaviors, it must inte-grate large amounts of diverse, rapidlyreceived information from manygroups of these neurons in variousbrain regions. This is an ever-changingsituation, involving vast numbers ofneurons that often function simultane-ously within specific systems of thebrain. The study of these systems ofneurons, or neural networks, hasemerged as a major area of research.The actions of neurons and neuralnetworks control mental activity.Even as you read this sentence, thou-sands of neurons are\"firing,\"exchanging messages that enable youto see the symbols on the page, under-stand them, and incorporate the infor-mation into your memory. These basicactions also allow you to considernew ideas and to respond with emo-tions and opinions.How do neurons actually commu-nicate? Each nerve cell bears a largenumber of highly branched filamentscalled dendrites and one long fila-ment called an axon. The dendritereceives a chemical message from anadjacent neuron. The chemical mes-sage is converted into an impulsethat involves the movement of elec-trically charged elements (ions), suchas sodium and potassium, throughthe cell membrane. This bioelectriccurrent travels along the length of theaxon, where the message is picked upby dendrites of neurons farther away.For the most part, nerve cells actu-ally do not touch each other. Rather,a tiny gap known as a synapse sepa-rates the axon of the transmittingneuron from the dendrite of thereceiving neuron. As the nerveimpulse reaches the end of the axon,chemical messengers, or neurotrans-mitters, carry the message across thesynapse. Dendrite NucleusSynapse CellBodyAxon Each nerve cell bears highly branched filaments called dendrites and a single long filament called an axon. The synapse is thespace between the axon of one nerve cell and the dendrite of another.186 Approximately 100 neurotransmit-ters and neuromodulators (otherchemicals that modify the function oreffects of a neurotransmitter) havebeen identified. These chemical mes-sengers are released from the terminalportion of the axon, cross the synapse,and bind to specific receptors (pro-teins that serve as sites of attachment)on the surface of the dendrite. Just asthe shape of a lock determines the fitof a key, the shape of the receptorallows it to bind a precise neurotrans-mitter. The binding of a neurotrans-mitter to an appropriate receptor setsoff a cascade of events within thereceiving neuron. These events stimu-late the receiving neuron to send anelectric current down its own axon,inducing chemical changes associatedwith the formation of thoughts, emo-tions, or memories. Complex machin-ery within the cellvarious enzymes,molecules known as second messen-gers, minerals such as calcium, andso-called coupling proteins that linkthe various componentscarry outthese processes. THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOLON THE isit important for alcoholresearchers to study neurons andneural networks? We study the cellu-lar events that underlie the brain'sresponse to alcohol because thisresearch will explain the basic chemi-cal and physiological processes thatare the foundation of alcohol addic-tion. Moreover, our studies provideinvaluable information about thebasic functioning of the brain itself.The functions of the brain areaccomplished through an intricateinterplay of numerous brain systems.To grasp a true picture of the sundryeffects of alcohol on the brain, wemust explore alcohol's actions at eachof the many levels of functional orga-Chapter II nization: the single neuron, cell-to-cell communication, and integratedneuron activities within brain sys-tems. Many studies focus on the mostbasic levelthe individual neuronand the effects of alcohol on the neu-ron's ability to transmit electrical sig-nals through its cell membrane.Cellular studies also probe the effectsof alcohol on neurotransmitters andneuromodulatorstheir productionand release by certain neurons andtheir binding to receptors on others.Studies of higher organizational levelsexplore the effects of alcohol on thephysiology of an isolated single neu-ron, on the composite activity of neu-rons within neural systems, and onthe whole brain structure and func-tion as measured through electro-physiology and behavior. THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOLON CELLULARCOMMUNICATIONClearly, alcohol has a profound effecton the brain. Nevertheless, scientistsstill do not understand how alcoholcan exert its effects to produce suchphenomena as intoxication, reinforce-ment, tolerance, and dependence.Because the brain exists principallyas a communication system, it isassumed that alcohol acts to altercommunication. Changes in commu-nication may result from alcohol'sactions on one or more levels of thebrain's functional organization.Studies of alcohol's actions on neu-ronsthe basic unit of the braincanprovide important information abouthow alcohol disrupts the communica-tion process. As a message, conveyedas a bioelectric travels downthe membrane, it stimulates therelease of neurotransmitters fromnerve endings. In turn, neurotrans-mitters act as chemical messengersthat cross the gap (synapse) between cells to carry the message to neigh-boring neurons. Studies of alcohol'sactions on the communication processexamine alcohol's effects on each ofthese stages: the communication of asignal within the neuron, the releaseof neurotransmitters from one neu-ron, and the binding of neurotrans-mitters to the neuron receiving amessage. Further, because the criticalevents involved in the messagetransmission occur in the membraneof the neuron, scientists are examin-ing whether alcohol alters communi-cation by modifying the membrane'schemical and physical structure.Investigators use electrophysio-logical techniques to uncover someof the mysteries surrounding alco-hol's effects on the brain's communi-cations systems. These proceduresenable scientists to study the capaci-ty of the neural membrane to propa-gate its bioelectric signal. Recently,the development of several new andinnovative techniques has enhancedresearchers' facility for examiningthese electrophysiological events.One such procedure, known asvoltage clamp recording, is a detailedand painstaking process in which ascientist, while looking through amicroscope, inserts the tip of a finemicroelectrode into a single cell. Thistechnique allows researchers to mea-sure varying current across the cellmembrane resulting from alcohol-induced changes in the flow of ionsthrough the membrane. \"Tear-offpatch clamping,\" a more recent tech-nique, permits an even closer look atthe effect of alcohol on ion movementacross the membrane. This procedurecan measure electrical events associat-ed with ions moving through a singleion channel (a protein that both cre-ates a pore in the membrane and con-trols the passage of ions into and outof the cell).Studies using these and similartechniques have demonstrated thatAlcohol Research: Promise for the Decade various brain regions differ in theirsensitivitytoalcohol.Theseapproaches also have shown that alco-hol can stimulate or hamper neuronfunctioning, depending on the type ofneuron (that is, which receptors arepresent on the membrane of the nervecell) and the brain region in which the Studieshave demonstratedthat various brainregions differ intheir sensitivityto alcohol. neurons are found. In addition, alco-hol may affect more than one type ofion channel and may increase ordecrease ion flow through these mem-brane pores.Overthenextfewyears,researchers will attempt to define theconductive mechanisms in differentbrain regions that are altered by alco-hol. Once these mechanisms aredefined, changes in the processes ofmessage transmission that occurwith chronic exposure to alcohol canbe measured. Findings from suchstudies can help to relate the electro-physiological effects of alcohol onspecific brain regions to the variousbehavioral actions associated withdrinking. NEUROTRANSMITTERS ANDRECEPTORSA neuron must be able to transmit asignal from one end of the cell to theother as well as interact with a widearray of other neurons. Because neu-rons do not actually touch each other, 8they must use a communication mech-anism that can bridge the synapse thatlies between adjacent cells.Intercellularcommunicationinvolves the release of neurotransmit-ters, an event stimulated by a bioelec-tric signal within the cell. The neuro-transmitter crosses the synapse andbinds to a receptor in the membraneof a neighboring cell. With the bind-ing, the neighboring cell may becomestimulated to fire or may become lessresponsive to other neurotransmit-ters.Accordingly, neurotransmittersserve to excite or to inhibit the firingof neighboring neurons. Becausesome neurotransmitters may act tomodulate the message of other neuro-transmitters, they are referred to asneuromodulators.Alcohol is interacting with specificreceptors on brain cell membranes.Alcohol, however, differs from thesepsychotropic drugs because it doesnot bind to one specific receptor.Rather, alcohol may act on distinctivereceptors in the brain, and its actionsmay be unique for each receptor or,further, for each neurotransmittersystem.Because alcohol may act on recep-tors and generate specific effectsdepending upon thereceptorinvolved, studying alcohol's actionson the brain is an extraordinarilycomplex challenge for researchers. Todefine and understand the specificbehaviors that stem from the effectsof alcohol on the brain, scientistsmust determine how alcohol exertsits actions on the cell surface recep-torswith whichitinteracts.Scientists, likewise, must ascertainhow many of the more than 100knownneurotransmittersareinvolved in the expression of alco- Chapter II NerveTerminal Complex Cell Receptor 45555555 hol's actions. At present, researchershave found evidence that a few neu-rotransmitter systems appear to beextremely sensitive to alcohol,including and the central nervoussystem. As an inhibitory neurotrans-mitter, the binding of GABA to itsreceptor on a neuron will dampen, ordecrease, the ability of that neuron topropagate its bioelectric signal, or tofire.The GABA receptor is actually acomplex of several protein subunits.Within this protein complex, there is aspecific binding site for the GABAmolecule. The binding of GABA to itsreceptor causes chloride ions to enterthe cell. This process makes it moredifficult for the neuron to fire, render-ing the neuron less sensitive to theeffects of other neurotransmitters.The GABA receptor also possessesa site that can bind drugs of the ben-zodiazepine class. Some benzodi-azepines, such as the tranquilizerdiazepam (Valium), further inhibit theability of the neuron to fire. Otherbenzodiazepines, however, producethe opposite effect and may evencause seizures.Scientists have begun to questionhow alcohol specifically affects theGABA receptor. It appears that theinfluence of alcohol on the GABAreceptor is analogous to that of thebenzodiazepines that function as tran-quilizers. Alcohol seems to enhancethe movement of chloride ions acrossthe cell membrane and reduce theability of the receiving neuron to fire.Two effects attributed to alcoholthe reduction of anxiety and the lossof motor coordination associated withintoxicationmay arise from theactions of alcohol on the GABA sys-tem, specifically its actions at theGABAreceptor.Atpresent,researchers are focusing their effortson studying alcohol's interactionswith GABA in the areas of the brainthat appear sensitive to the effects ofalcohol.219Molecules of gamma-aminobutyricacid (GABA) released into a synapsebind to receptors embedded in the sur-face of a nerve cell.This binding tendsto bring about an inhibition of thenerve cell's activity. Alcohol and ben-zodiazepines (such as the tranquilizerValium) exert some of their effects atthis receptor. Alcohol Research: Promise for the Decade NMDA receptor The neurotransmitter glutamate, acting at the NMDA receptor, is involved in learning,memory formation, and nerve cell development. Alcohol interferes with the functionof this receptor, possibly contributing to memory disorders, impaired nervous systemdevelopment, and alcohol withdrawal seizures. Courtesy of Dr. Boris Tabakoff.In addition, scientists are focusingon identifying the characteristics ofthe GABA receptor that render it sen-sitive to alcohol. The configuration ofdifferent GABA subunits in selectbrain areas may contribute to alco-hol's varying effects on different brainregions. Findings from these studiesmay pave the way for genetic researchexploring why some people differ intheir response to alcohol.Tolerance to alcohol's sedativeeffects may result from an adaptiveresponse of ion channels controlled byGABA to the chronic presence of alco-hol. Studies using neurons taken fromanimals made tolerant to the sedativeeffects of alcohol have shown that thestimulatory effect of alcohol onGABA-controlled chloride ion chan-nels in these cells is either reduced orabsent.Glutamate and NMDAWhereas GABA is the major inhibito-ry neurotransmitter in brain, glu-tamate is the major excitatory brainneurotransmitter, accounting forapproximately 40 percent of all thenerve signals sent throughout thebrain. When glutamate binds to itsreceptor on a neuron, it augments thepotential of that neuron to fire. Anumber of distinct subtypes of gluta-mate receptors are named for variouschemical analogs (substances thatalso specifically bind to these recep-tors). Alcohol primarily affects thereceptor subtype named after the N-methyl-D-aspar-tate, neuron's to stimuli. At this receptor,glutamate has been implicated insuch phenomena as learning andmemory formation and is involved inneuronal development.Evidence suggests that the NMDAreceptor may be involved in thedevelopment of physical dependenceon alcohol. Under normal conditions,activation of the NMDA receptorallows calcium ions to flow throughion channels into the cell, therebycausing the cell to become excited.Short-term exposure to alcoholinhibits NMDA-stimulated and, consequently, dampens When the brain22 10is exposed chronically to alcohol,however, it begins to compensate forthis effect: The number of NMDA-activated ion channels in This adaptive process(known as upregulation) could resultin hyperexcitability of neurons, amajor factor in physical dependence.In addition, this process may accountfor several of the chronic effects ofheavy drinking, including alcohol-withdrawal seizures.Alcohol can impair memory andlearning processes, as well as produceprofoundcognitiveproblems.Recently, scientists have found evi-dence that glutamate and the NMDAreceptor may play a significant role inthese damaging alcohol-inducedeffects. This area of research is com-pelling, given the suggested role ofthe glutamate and the NMDA recep-tor in normal memory functions.Knowledge of the interaction betweenalcohol and the NMDA receptor canhelp us to understand more fully thememory impairments that result fromheavy drinking, including the phe-nomenon of that serotonin, aneurotransmitter involved in mood,sleep, and consummatory serotonin-uptake blockerssubstances thatblock brain serotonin neurotransmitterto analyze therole of serotonin in alcohol consump-tion. They have found that serotonin-uptake blockers appear to diminishsomewhat the desire for alcohol insome alcoholics, a possible indicationof the role of serotonin in alcohol con-sumption. These findings could haveconsiderable importance in futuredevelopment of medications to con-trol craving for alcohol. Much of our knowledge of neuro-transmitters and receptors has beenattained through studies using geneticanimal models of alcoholism. Animalmodels are important research toolsbecause they allow for controlledanalysis of many biological charac-teristics observed in human studies.By selectively breeding animals thatexhibit distinct characteristics ofalcoholism, researchers can exploretheneurochemicaldifferencesbetween the animals serving as mod-els for alcoholism and control ani-mals. For example, rats that display apreference for drinking alcohol havebeen selectively bred to .develop thealcohol-preferring (P) rat line. As con-trol animals, rats exhibiting a strongaversion for alcohol have been bredselectively to produce the nonprefer-ring (NP) line. Neurochemical studiesof these animals have revealed that Prats consistently have lower serotoninlevels than NP rats in select regions oftheir brains. To date, a number ofgenetic animal models have beendeveloped, providing knowledge ofalcohol-seeking behavior as well as ofneurochemical substrates of intoxica-tion, dependence, and withdrawal. ALCOHOL AND THE CELLMEMBRANEIt has been suggested that the effectsof alcohol may arise from its ability todisrupt the cell membrane: Alcoholhas some ability to dissolve in water aswell as in the fatty substances thatcomprise the cell membrane.Regardless of the cell type, everycell has a membrane that provides aphysical barrier between the insideand outside of the cell. The receptorsdiscussed previously are embedded inthe cell membrane. The cell mem-brane also serves additional functions.It gives the cell its shape and acts as agatekeeper, allowing only selectedChapter II molecules, such as water; certainnutrients; and selected ions to enterthe cell. Alcohol molecules also maycross this barrier.Changes in the chemistry of thecell membrane are an important topicin alcohol research. Cell membranesare composed primarily of lipids (fator fat-like substances) and proteins.To varying degrees, alcohol can dis-solve in the cell membrane and weak-en the bond between lipid moleculesin the membrane, causing the lipids tobecome disordered. Thus, alcoholmay cause the membrane to lose somerigidity and become more fluid. Suchfluidization may alter the function of Much of ourknowledge ofneurotransmittersand receptors has beenattained through studies usinggenetic animal modelsof alcoholism. proteins embedded in the membrane,thereby impairing the ability of nervecells to process information.Research has suggested that it isunlikely that changes on a broad scalein membrane fluidity can account formost of the effects of alcohol. Yet, achange in the physical properties of aparticular \"microdomain\"a mem-brane region that circumscribes animportant functional protein such as areceptor or ion channelcould bepart of the explanation of the effects ofalcohol on brain function. Advancedtechniques of physical chemistry andbiophysics now permit this vital areaof investigation to be pursued.2,311 Alcohol Research: Promise for the Decade ProteinNPhospholipid head groupsof different typesPhospholipidBilayer AlcoholAction AlcoholAction The nerve cell membrane is composed mainly of lipids arranged in a bilayer, withinwhich are inserted various proteins, including receptors for neurotransmitters.

Forexample, the messenger may signalthe neuron to fire, or it may direct theneuron to ignore firing signals fromother receptors. In addition, the signalof the chemical messenger may triggera metabolic event in the receiving neu-ron. The process of the conversion of asignal to a chemical or physiologicalaction is known as signal transduc-tion. Signal transduction involves spe-cialized proteins (such as the G pro-tein), as well as a family of enzymesinvolved in the generation of mole-cules, known as second messengers,that act to relay the message withinthe cell. Recent research indicates thatalcohol's effect on second messengersystems may influence the biochem-istry of neural transmission synaptic regulates lev-els of the second messenger cyclicAMP (cAMP) within the cell. cAMPaffects protein activity and synthesis;thus, its proper functioning is impor-tant to long-term cellular conse-quences for cellular well-being. Threelinked componentsa receptor in themembrane, a regulatory proteinknown as the G protein, and a catalyt-24 12is unit of ACcontribute to theexpression of AC activity.Some research findings suggestthat the G receptor may be the sitefor alcohol's effects on this system.For example, in the brain striatum(an area believed to be important inmotor and cognitive brain functions),the neurotransmitter dopamineappears to stimulate AC activity byinteracting with G protein and theAC catalytic unit. Alcohol appears toenhance the effects of dopamine onAC activity, possibly by activatingthe G regulatory protein. In turn, ACactivation increases cAMP levels inthe cell. Researchers recently haveshown, however, that brain cellsadapt to long-term exposure to alco-hol by reducing AC-stimulatedcAMP levels:Cells begin to requirealcohol to achieve normal levels ofAC-stimulated cAMP. This processmay represent a form of cellular\"dependence\" on alcohol. Becausethe AC system is common to severalneurotransmitter systems, futurestudies of alcohol's effects on AChold great promise for identifyingthe mechanisms that underlie theseeffects.The effects of alcohol on secondmessenger systems can modify aneuron's electrical excitability andchemical properties. These systems,which play key roles in signal trans-duction, appear to be involved inmany of alcohol's actions on thebrain. Much of our knowledge aboutalcohol's effects on second messen-ger systems is preliminary yetpromisinga foundation for excit-ing research advances in this area inthe coming decade. ALCOHOL AND NEURALNETWORKSThe brain functions by analyzingand transmitting many pieces of information simultaneously. Thou-sands of interconnecting neurons fire atthe same moment, communicating ahost of distinct messages within thebrain. These interconnecting neuronsmay be thought of as the wiring fordistinct nerve message tracks, knownas neural networks. The brain mustsimultaneously process, integrate,and appropriately respond to all ofthe signals received from the manyneural networks.Although the actual process islikely to be exceedingly complex, asimplified model of the brain eventsthat may transpire with alcohol useillustrates how simultaneous pro-cessing from distinct neural net-works might affect brain function.As an individual drinks alcohol, processesdetails about alcohol's smell,rewarding and value even aboutprevious drinking experiences. Insome individuals, genetic or otherfactors might cause networksinvolved in a specific activity, suchas the communication of euphoria,to prevail over circuits that conveyother information on the effects ofalcohol, creating an inaccurate andinappropriate assessment of thephysiological events that have tran-spired. Such imbalances in neuralinformation processing could be asignificant factor in fostering drink-ing, in craving, and in developingalcohol abuse and alcoholism.During the next decade, ourstudy of information processingwill help us to identify the specificneural networks important in alco-hol use and to determine their rolein alcohol abuse and alcoholism.Innovative electrophysiological andcomputer technologies will enhanceour efforts to define these networks,to record their physiological andelectrical activity, and to experi-mentally manipulate multipleChapter II groups of neurons to learn moreabout their role in the brain. Further,we can use laboratory-generatedinformation about simple systems tobuild models of circuits in thehuman brain. 25 13 , FocusON BRAINIMAGING TOOLS The most important sites of alcohol'sactions undoubtedly lie within thebrain. It is the actions of alcohol on thebrain that produce intoxication, rein-forcement of continued alcohol use,and important features of the diseaseprocess of alcoholism.Until recently, studies of alcohol'sactions on the brain could be conduct-ed only after a patient's death, whenthe brain could be examined physical-ly. Although autopsy studies permit-ted scientists to examine the brainlesions and cell loss that can resultfrom heavy drinking, these investiga-tions provided little knowledge aboutalcohol's interaction with the bio-chemical pathways in the living brainthat produce intoxication, craving,dependence, and tolerance. Moreover,researchers were unable to examinethe events in the living brain thatplace some individuals at greater vul-nerability than others to alcoholism.With the development of noninva-sive imaging techniques, researchershave the exciting opportunity toexplore inside the living brain andprobe its biochemistry and physiolo-gy. No longer restricted to autopsystudies, alcohol researchers now canuse imaging tools to follow alcohol-induced changes over time in thebrains of living people and to relatethese changes to thinking and behav-ior.By providing an altogether newapproach to assessing alcoholism,imaging techniques offer new promisein the quest for answers to such fun-damental questions as:Do chemical changes in the brainproduce such features of alco-holism as craving for alcohol andimpaired control over drinkingbehavior? What region(s) or bio-chemical pathway(s) in the brainare involved these processes?27 15The MRI scanner uses magnetic fieldsand radiofrequency waves to formexquisitely detailed three-dimensionalpictures of anatomical structures in thebody. Photograph courtesy of Dr.Adolph Pfefferbaum. How does chronic alcohol abusedamage brain tissue? Are someregions of the brain more sensitivethan others to the deleteriouseffects of alcohol? Are some indi-viduals more vulnerable to thisdamage than others? Does absti-nence reverse the damage? Isthere a predictable relationshipbetween the physical damage tothe brain and the loss of certainmental capabilities experienced bysome alcoholics?Recognizing that genetic factorscontribute to the risk of develop-ing alcoholism, are there inherentdifferences in the central nervoussystem that differentiate personsat higher risk and lower risk foralcohol addiction? Do high-riskindividuals respond differently toalcohol than low-risk individuals?Is the vulnerability among high-risk individuals specific to alcoholor do these individuals respondsimilarly to other drugs of abuse?Are early signs of withdrawal orphysical dependence more appar-ent in high-risk individuals thanin low-risk individuals afteradministration of alcohol? Whichneural systems are involved?Currently, a variety of imagingtools are available to researchers andclinicians. Some methods provideinformation about the size, shape, andphysical integrity of the brain. Otherapproaches assess the brain at workby measuring electrical activity, bloodflow, oxygen and glucose use, andneurotransmitter activity. Althougheach technique has distinctivestrengths, the coupling of two or moreapproaches can provide multifacetedknowledge about the brain structuresand functions involved in the vulnera-bility to and expression of alcoholism.Some of these new techniques aredescribed in the sections that follow.Alcohol Research: Promise for the Decade IMAGING TECHNIQUES Positron Emission TomographyPositron emission tomography (PET)is one of the most powerful of the newnoninvasive scanning technologies.This technique employs short-livedradioisotopes, linked to a key mole-cule such as sugar or oxygen, whichare introduced into the body. As thecompounds enter the brain, they emitradioactive energy (a positron) that isdetected by special cameras arrangedaround an individual's head. With theaid of a computer, the emittedradioactivity is processed into a three-dimensional image of the brain thatshows the distribution and concentra-tion of the radioactive compounds.PET offers an exciting opportunityto view directly the brain networksand physiological and biochemicalprocesses involved in specific behav-iors or functions. For example, PETcan map brain activity by trackingand measuring brain glucose metabo-lism. Glucose is the sole source ofenergy for the brain. Thus, systems ofthe brain involved in various func-tions or tasks metabolize glucose toobtain energy to perform work. Byusing PET to trace the distribution ofradiolabeled glucose throughout thebrain, scientists can identify those sys-tems and regions involved in a specif-ic behavior or function. PET also candetect changes in glucose levels inlocalized brain regions, therebyrevealing systems that use more ener-gy thanothers.Inthisway,researchers can identify systems thatbecome more active than others as anindividual exhibits a behavior or per-forms a task.In addition, PET can be used toexamine specific brain neurotransmit-ter systems. To date, tracers devel-oped for the study of dopamine andserotoninneuroreceptorshave This color-coded, three-dimensional PET image of the brain, constructed from 16 two-dimensional brain slices, depicts glucose utilization and thus, functional activity, indifferent brain areas.

Such studieshold great promise for identifyingthe role of various neurotransmittersystems in however,SPECT injected radioisotopesthat emit a gamma particle, producinga single photon that is recorded with aSPECT camera. Recent improvementsin SPECT instrumentation make itpossible to rotate the cameras in dif-ferent planes. This technique, whichcan be employed to observe bloodflow in the brain (to mirror closelybrain metabolism), currently is enjoy-ing widespread clinical application.Magnetic ResonanceTechniquesMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) isa new structural imaging techniquethat provides exquisitely detailed pic-tures of the anatomical structure ofany organ of the body, including thebrain. This technique does not useionizing radiation, such as x-rays.Rather, an individual, lying inside alarge superconducting magnet, isexposed to magnetic fields. Exposureto magnetic fields and radiofrequencywaves causes certain atoms in thebrain to emit signals as the atomsalign and realign within a field. Thesignals vary in intensity, dependingon the substance from which theyoriginate. MRI scanners use the sig-nals emitted from atoms with oddnumbers of protons, such as hydrogen(the most abundant element in tissue),to form three-dimensional images inwhich different types of tissue can be!t4 differentiated and specific anatomicalstructures of the brain can be outlined.This technique offers severaladvantages over other structuralimaging devices. MRI producesimages with amazing clarity usingmagnetic fieldsnot x-rays. Hence,an individual can have repeated MRIswithout the risk of exposure to ioniz-ing radiation. MRI also offers greatflexibility for viewing the brain frommany different directions. Finally,MRI allows scientists and clinicians todistinguish gray matter (primarilycomposed of nerve cells) from whitematter (primarily composed of thelong \"wires,\" or axons, connectingnerve cells) within the brain.Advances in magnetic resonancetechnology have broadened the appli-cation of this technology to allow thestudy of structure and of biochemistryof the living brain. Magnetic reso-nance spectroscopy (MRS), a newtechnique resulting from technologi-cal.advances, uses the MRI scanner toexamine the proton signals of mole-cules such as fat, amino acids (thebuilding blocks of proteins), andmetabolic products, which behave dif-ferently in a strong magnetic field.The resulting images provide detailed2917Computer-colorized magneticresonance images of the brain froma healthy 57-year-old man and a57-year-old man with a history of heavyalcohol consumption. Magneticresonance images reveal detailedstructural information, such as theneuroanatomical changes producedby alcohol. These changes are evidentin the enlarged ventricles in thealcoholic's brain compared to thecontrol's brain. Courtesy of Dr. AdolphPfefferbaum. information about the metabolic stateof regions of brain tissue. MRS alsomay measure magnetic resonance sig-nals from phosphorus atoms, thusproviding information about the con-centrations of compounds critical tocellular energy. The concentrations ofthese compounds correspond to theactivity of the specific systems or net-works in the brain.Until recently, the use of MRS waslimited to assessing the chemicalcomposition of a single volume ofmaterial without constructing animage. With new technologicaladvances, however, it is possible toproduce three-dimensional imagesthat detail the chemical events occur-ring within the organ under study.Currently, MRS produces images ofcoarser resolution than those of PET.Yet, as MRS technology improves, itwill offer researchers a unique oppor-tunity: Because, unlike PET, MRSdoes not use radiolabeled tracers,MRS can be used repeatedly on thesame individual, allowing examine specific metabolic andphysiologic events over time.ElectroencephalographyThe electroencephalogram (EEG),measured electrodes placed instandard positions on the scalp, is arecord of the spontaneous electricalactivity within the living brain. Thenormal human EEG usually is classi-fied into four major brain waves:beta, alpha, theta, and delta. Eachwave has a distinctive amplitude andfrequency. Characteristic wave pat-terns occur in varying proportionswith different behavioral states. Forexample, as a person passes into sleep,the slower frequency delta wavebecomes predominant. These changesin frequency can be quantified withcomputer techniques.EEG also reveals the effects ofdrugs, metabolic conditions, andinjury (such as head trauma andAlcohol Research: Promise for the Decade stroke) on brain electrical activity.Such factors can produce abnormalpatterns, reduced wave amplitude,and a shift in wave frequency.Event-related potential (ERP), atechnologicallyadvanced EEGmethod, measures specific electricalresponses to a sensory stimulus, suchas a sight or a sound. EEG electrodesare placed on the scalp to measure theelectrical responses within a fractionof the second that follows the deliveryof the external stimulus. The ERPwaveforms, which result from the Today's imaging technologywill enable researchers to observedirectly the dynamic mechanismsthat are the disease ofalcoholism. activity of the various brain processesthat occur in response to outside stim-uli or endogenous brain activity, areembedded in background EEG noise.Thus, a computerized method, knownas averaging, must be used to extractthe characteristic waveforms of theevoked responses from the back-ground EEG activity. The ERP tech-nique has the unique value of measur-ing mental activity that occurs on theorder of milliseconds, providing animmediate record of brain activityassociated with sensory and cognitiveprocessing.Recent advances in computer tech-nology and mathematical analyses ofsignals have made it possible to assessthe spatial and temporal properties ofevent-related brain potentials. Onesuch method, known as dipole sourcelocalization, has as its basis the dipole,the simplest current source in thebrain. With dipole source localization, 18the ERP is modeled as arising frommultiple intracranial electrical dipolesources. This method offers greatpromise as a means to partition ERPwaveforms emanating from concur-rently active brain regions intosubprocesses that are anatomicallylocalized as biophysical sources ofelectrical activity. IMAGING TECHNIQUES INALCOHOL RESEARCHHeretofore, alcohol researchers haveattempted to understand alcoholismby examining the external manifesta-tions of the disease. Today's imagingtechnology will enable researchers toobserve directly the dynamic mecha-nisms that are the disease.Each of the imaging tools dis-cussed, with its distinctive strengths,can provide key information aboutstructural and functional brain injuryassociated with alcohol use, aboutvulnerability to alcoholism, and aboutthe brain processes and anatomicalsites involved in elements of the dis-ease (craving, impaired control,dependence, tolerance, and relapseand recovery). Collectively, this infor-mation can provide a complete pic-ture of the disease process.Any consumption of alcoholappears to affect numerous metabolic,physiologic, and neurotransmittersystems in the brain. Additionalresearch is needed to identify the sys-tems involved, to determine how theyare affected, and to understand howalcohol's actions on one system mayinfluence other systems in the brain.Imaging techniques can be vital to thisresearch. Specifically, PET, SPECT,and MRS have the potential to tracethe regional brain distribution of alco-hol and to characterize alcohol'seffects on the biochemistry and physi-ology of these various brain regions.Because MRS does not expose people to radioisotopes, it offers the distinctopportunity to examine the samestudy subjects repeatedly and followalcohol's actions in the brain overtime. Superimposing MRI imagesover all of these maps of brain func-tion will help to identify the brainstructures affected by alcohol'sactions. In addition, ERP mappingstudies can show alcohol's effects onelectrical activity within various brainregions. When considered together,these findings will enable researchersto study the effects of alcohol on spe-cific brain systems and structures,potentially providing insight into howdrinking alcohol can produce pleasur-able sensations, reduce anxiety, altermood, influence cognitive processing,and cause sedation.Efforts to identify why some peo-ple seemingly possess a greater vul-nerability for developing alcoholismthan others may be facilitated greatlywith imaging techniques. Already,electroencephalography studies haveprovided fascinating information inthis regard. Alcohol appears to affectEEG activity in high-risk persons dif-ferently than in low-risk individuals:After drinking, greater variations infast EEG activity are observed amonghigh-risk sons of alcoholic fathersthan among low-risk individuals.Using ERP, researchers have foundthat alcohol-naive sons of alcoholicsdisplay reduced amplitude of the P3wave, a genetically determined wavethat appears during the performanceof cognitive tasks. This trait may be amarker for genetic vulnerability.These early findings suggest that elec-troencephalography will providemuch knowledge about the functionof electrical activity in genetic suscep-tibility to alcoholism.Electroencephalography studies nodoubt will continue to broaden ourknowledge of the genetic factorsinvolved in the development of alco-holism; yet, other imaging approachesalso can contribute significantly to thisunderstanding. Using MRS, PET, andSPECT, scientists can address a criticalquestion concerning the role of func-tional processes in susceptibility toalcoholism: Are there inherent func-tional differences in some individualsthat cause them to respond to alcoholdifferently than others? Imaging tech-niques may reveal that some individ-uals respond differently to alcoholbecause it may affect different systemsin them than it does in others.

Imaging tools can helpresearchers to identify and more fullyunderstand these brain processes. Forexample, behavioral changes often areobserved in recovering individualsprior to a relapse to drinking, suggest-Alcohol Research: Promise for the Decade ing that a physiological event in thebrain may account for the observedchange in behavior. Until now, scien-tists have not had the means to searchfor and identify the brain processesthat underlie relapse. Noninvasiveimaging technology provides a win-dow through which scientists canstudy the biochemistry and physiolo-gy of the living brain. By using PETand MRS to examine brain biochem-istry and physiology before, during,and after relapse, scientists well may 20define the neural processes involvedin the return to drinking. This knowl-edge, in turn, should lead to recogni-tion of the means by which the brainprocesses underlying relapse may becontrolledgreatly enhancing thepotential for recovery.Imaging tools also provide greatopportunity to examine the injury tobrain structures and processes thatresults from chronic drinking. MRIstudies have shown that the percent-age of gray brain matter declines withage, while the percentage of whitematter remains relatively constant.Alcoholics, however, have significant-ly less gray and white brain matterthan their nonalcoholic peers, suggest-ing that alcohol may accelerate thebrain's aging process.Future studies using MRS, PET,SPECT, and ERP will enhance ourunderstanding of this process, possi-bly characterizing functional distur-bances associated with chronic drink-ing. Chronic drinking can impair aperson's ability to reason and toprocess information. These tools willenable researchers to identify theunderlying brain injury that producesthis impairment. Further, imagingtools will allow scientists to examinewhether abstinence leads to reversalof the damage.Similarly, these tools will enhancegreatly our knowledge of alcohol'sinjurious effects on the developingbrain. Children born to alcohol-abusingmothers may exhibit a number ofcharacteristic alcohol-related defects,classified clinically as fetal alcoholsyndrome (FAS) and fetal alcoholeffects (FAE). Damage to the centralnervous system is one of the mostprofound defects in FAS and FAE Patterns of electrical activities, markedby the color shading, are different inindividuals who are at risk for develop-ing alcoholism (top) than in low-risk indi-viduals (bottom).

A significant need exists tocorrelate the behavioral and intellec-tual dysfunctions seen in the childrenwith underlying brain abnormalities.The use of noninvasive functional andstructural techniques allows fordetailed study of brain anatomy andactivity in these children. Couplingthese tools with tests to assess neu-ropsychological problems in childrenwill allow researchers to identify theextent and nature of fetal alcoholeffects in individual children. Thesetechnologies also may pinpoint thespecific brain areas that appear mostvulnerable to alcohol's actions duringdevelopment. In addition, noninva-sive imaging tools can help to classifythe severity of alcohol-related braininjury.Finally, imaging tools will enableresearchers to follow the effects oftreatment by observing the changesthat may occur within the brain, notonly as a result of medications butalso as individuals experience tradi-tional behavioral and verbal therapies.Althoughtraditionaltherapyapproaches benefit a large number ofalcoholics trying to achieve and main-tain sobriety, it remains to be deter-mined how these approaches influ-ence recovering individuals. Theeffect of successful therapy on brainprocesses and cognitive behavior ofpatients currently cannot be studied.Imaging toolsespecially ERP, PET,and MRSeventually may provide ameans to observe adaptations in neur-al systems that occur over time inresponse to successful therapy.Moreover, such studies can provideinsight into understanding why vari-ous treatment approaches are ineffec-tive for some alcoholics and may helpto distinguish the forms of treatmentmost suited to particular patients.Ultimately, these studies may provideuseful information for defining sub-types of alcoholics.Imaging technologies also can con-tribute significantly to research ondevelopment of new medications foralcoholism treatment. Although thepotential for pharmacological treat-ment is widely recognized, few med-icationsareavailabletoday.However, imaging tools will enableresearchers to observe the actions ofpotential medications on specificneural systems and to test their effica-cy in mitigating alcohol problems. 21 I IIIGENETICS ANDENVIRONMENT People vary considerably in theirdrinking behavior and in their sensi-tivity to alcohol's effects. Some indi-viduals drink only moderate amountsof alcohol and experience few, if any,problems from their drinking. Others,however, become addicted to alcoholand may develop serious medicalconsequences, encounter adversesocial difficulties, or experience bothas a result.The vulnerability that some peopleseemingly possess to developing alco-holism has prompted researchers tosearch for factors that may contributeto heightened susceptibility. The lega-cy of alcoholism in families andamong certain ethnic groups suggeststhat genetic factors can increase anindividual's vulnerability for this dis-ease. On the other hand, researchersalso have observed that individualswithin certain ethnic groups have pro-tective genetic factors that make itdoubtful they will ever abuse alcohol.Nevertheless, the distribution ofalcoholism within any given popula-tion indicates that genetic factorsalone cannot account for the develop-ment of the disease; environmentalfactors also have an important effecton drinking. Family dynamics, peerinfluences, cultural values, everydaystresses, and a host of other influencesshape our thinking about alcohol andaffect our drinking behavior.In an attempt to understand whyonly some people who drink advanceto problematic drinking, alcoholresearchers are exploring the age-oldquestion of nature versus nurture.This research, to date, has yielded awealth of knowledge about the genet-ic determinants of alcoholismknowledge that has led to profoundchanges in society's view of alcoholabuse and alcoholism as matters ofpublic health.The modern public health model ofdisease holds that many human illnesses3523Computer drawn deoxyribonucleicacid (DNA) illustrates the double-stranded helical sugarand phosphate; linked pairs of basesthat connect the strands of the helixdetermine genetic coding. Courtesyof NIH archives. result from the interaction of environ-mental and genetic factors. The sus-ceptibility to high cholesterol levels isan example of this model: Althoughgenetic makeup may heighten an indi-vidual's risk for high blood choles-terol levels, regular exercise and a dietlow in saturated fat and cholesterolcould counteract much of this geneticvulnerability. The awareness thatalcohol-related problems follow thissame gene-environment model hasinfluenced greatly the course of alco-hol research during the past decade.In addition, the results of severalpivotal adoption and twin studiesconducted over the past 25 years sug-gest that alcoholism is a heteroge-neous disorder, with some forms thatare highly heritable and others thatare less so. Alcoholism, like hyperten-sion, coronary artery disease, and dia-betes, appears to be a disorder inwhich environmental factors activategenetic components. In other words,genetic predisposition does not implypredestination: Environmental factorsare needed for alcoholism to developin persons who have inherited a vul-nerability for the disease.Although much remains to belearned about the specific biologicalfactors involved in the developmentof alcoholism, it now is recognizedthat alcoholism stems from a complexinterplay between genetic and envi-ronmental factors. This knowledgeopens avenues for developing medica-tions and other biological therapiesthat compensate for genetic suscepti-bility. Moreover, it lays the founda-tion for conceiving prevention, earlyintervention, and treatment methodsthat focus on changing environmentalrisk factors for alcohol abuse anddependence. For example, neurophar-macologists one day may develop amedication that can counterbalance agenetic factor that enhances nervecells' vulnerability to the effects ofalcohol. At the same time, behavioralAlcohol Research: Promise for the Decade researchers may devise psychothera-peutic techniques to help geneticallyvulnerable individuals deal moreeffectively with drinking-related stres-sors and craving.However, little is known about theway that genes and environmentinteract to produce different types ofalcohol-related problems. Researchersacknowledge that such factors as per-sonality, cognition, and socioculturalnorms contribute profoundly to thedevelopment of alcohol abuse and It is now recognizedthat alcoholism stemsfrom a complex interplaybetween geneticand environmentalfactors. alcoholism. In the next decade, studiesfocusing on gene-environment inter-play will provide insight into thegenetic mechanisms involved in thedevelopment of alcoholism. GENETIC SOURCES OFVULNERABILITYStudies of persons raised in adoptivehomes from an early age provided theearliest clues that genetic factors play arole in alcoholism and that environ-mental factors influence whether a per-son with genetic vulnerability for alco-holism actually develops the disease.Adoption studies help to untangle thecontributions of genes and family envi-ronment, allowing these elements to beevaluated independently. The effects ofgenetic factors can be estimated bycomparing individuals with differentgenetic backgrounds who are raised in3b home (such as adoptees andtheir nongenetic siblings); influences can be assessed genetically related individuals(such as adoptees and their nonadopt-ed genetic siblings) who are raised indifferent environments.An adoption study in Denmarkrevealed that the adopted-away sons ofalcoholics were more than three timesas likely to become alcoholic as theadopted sons of nonalcoholics. A large-scale study in Sweden confirmed theseresults, showing that the incidence ofalcoholism among male adoptees bornto severely alcoholic fathers was three-and-one-half times greater than amongadopted sons of nonalcoholic men. Inaddition, male adoptees of alcohol-abusing biological mothers werealmost twice as likely to become alco-hol abusers themselves as maleadoptees born to mothers who did notabuse alcohol.Analysis of the Swedish adoptionstudies revealed the existence of twoprototypic forms of alcoholism thatdiffer in inheritance patterns, alcohol-related behaviors, personality traits,and environmental influences. TypeI alcoholism, also known as milieu-limited alcoholism, is a more commonform that occurs in both men andwomen and is associated with adult-onset alcohol abuse in either biologicalparent. This form is called milieu-limit-ed because its expression requires bothgenetic predisposition and environ-mental provocation.Type II alcoholism, also known asmale-limited alcoholism, is a severetype of predisposition found only inmen. Less common than Type I, TypeII is associated with severe, early-onset alcoholism in the biologicalfather. Its transmission is highlygenetic and appears to be unaffectedby environment.As with other genetically transmit-ted diseases, the search for geneticfactors responsible for susceptibility Chapter III U Female Maleaa 4i) Female Deceased AiMale DeceasedII Marijuana SchizophreniaSD: Somatization Disorder to alcoholism has involved severalstages. Studies in the primary stageinvolved a close observation of famil-ial incidence. In the next phase, stud-ies focused on analyzing families todetermine whether environment orgenes caused the family linkage. Atpresent, genetic research on alco-holism is moving into the area of mol-ecular biology to isolate and identifythe gene or genes that may confervulnerability for this disease. MOLECULAR BIOLOGY:STUDYING THE CHEMISTRY OFINHERITANCEMolecular biology is a relatively newarea of science in which knowledge ofnormal physiology and of disease isgained through the study of genes.Located in the nucleus of the cell,genes carry information for hereditarycharacteristics. Housed within genesare complex sets of instructions thatdirect the development, organization,and functioning of the human body.The scores of instructions are con-tained not in one gene but, rather, arefound in thousands of genes. Genesare organized and stored in structuresknown as chromosomes, each ofwhich contains thousands of genes.By their chemical structure, genescontrol every detail about develop-ment of the body: They specify thebody's size, shape, and color and pro-vide directions for the functioning ofbodily systems, such as the nervousand circulatory systems. Genetic infor-mation is coded in the deoxyribonu-cleic acid (DNA) molecule, the prima-ry component of genes. DNA is a giant3725Studying family pedigrees enablesresearchers to assess familial frequencyof alcoholism. Courtesy of Dr. DavidGoldman. double-stranded molecule that resem-bles a ladder twisted into a helicalshape. The sides of the DNA structureare composed of deoxyribose sugarand phosphate; the rungs consist oflinked pairs of bases. It is the sequenceof these base pairs in the DNA chainthat constitutes the genetic code.Although genes specify the organi-zation and functions of structureswithin the human body, they do notactually construct these structures.Rather, the DNA that embodies a geneis \"read\" in a process known as tran-scription. Through transcription, acopy of a gene is created in a formcalled ribonucleic acid (RNA). RNAacts as a template and, through theprocess of translation, directs the syn-thesis of proteinsmolecules thatform structural components of cellsand tissues and perform physiologicalfunctions.Thus, genes are the blueprint of thehuman body, directing the synthesis ofthe body's proteins. If a gene is defec-tive, the corresponding protein will bedefective, resulting in a structural orfunctional abnormality. Such abnormal-ities are the basis of genetic diseases.The tools of molecular biologyenable researchers to study the connec-tion between genes and correspondingproteins. Various techniques can beused to isolate specific DNA fragmentsfor study. Numerous copies of a genesubsequently can be reproduced with atechnique known as molecular cloning.Additionaltechniquespermitresearchers to read the sequences of thebase pairs in the DNA fragment thatcomprises the gene. By so doing, theycan determine whether a change in thebase sequence accounts for a particulargenetic defect.In alcohol research, molecular biol-ogy has revolutionized the search forgenetic determinants of alcoholism.By applying molecular cloning tech-niques, researchers now have toolsthat potentially can identify and char-Alcohol Research: Promise for the Decade acterize the genes involved in an indi-vidual's heightened vulnerability tothis alcoholism. IDENTIFYING GENETICVULNERABILITYArmed with strong and increasingevidence for genetic transmission ofalcoholism, researchers are concentrat-ing on identifying the genetic mecha-nisms responsible for predispositionto this disease. Towards this aim,researchers are studying families todetermine whether certain heritabletraits are highly associated with theoccurrence of alcoholism. Traitscotransmitted with genetic predisposi-tion to alcoholism can be used asmarkers to identify individuals atincreased risk for developing alco-holism. Although these cotransmittedtraits have not yet been identified,researchers are considering traits that Adenylate cyclaseis another enzymethat is receiving considerableresearch attention as apossible marker ofpredisposition toalcoholism. may be linked to genetic susceptibilityto alcoholism within three promisingcategories:Behavioral traits (impul-sive and violent behavior), physio-logical traits (EEG abnormalities,upper body sway), and biochemicaltraits (enzymes involved in neuro-transmitter metabolism). Once theassociated markers are identified, thegenes that produce them can be3826located, isolated, and cloned. Thelocation of such markers can serve asa reference point on the genome,providing the means for mappingthe gene or genes that may confervulnerability to alcoholism.Among the several types of bio-chemical markers of genetic suscepti-bility to alcoholism currently beingstudied, enzymes to date havereceived the most attention. Anenzyme is a protein that accelerates achemical reaction but does not under-go a net change itself. Becauseenzymes are direct products of genes,variations in the properties ofenzymes can be traced easily to varia-tions in the corresponding genes.Moreover, certain enzymes are close-ly associated with mechanisms andsites in the body known to be affectedby alcohol. Both features makeenzymes valuable as markers ofgenetic involvement.The monoamine ofpredisposition to alcoholism. Mono-amine oxidase is involved in themetabolism of several neurotransmit-ters implicated in certain aspects ofalcoholism. Several studies havereported abnormally low MAO levelsin blood platelets of alcoholics com-pared with those of nonalcoholics.Moreover, because genetic factors con-trol variations in MAO levels amongpeople, researchers believe that thistrait is not a secondary effect of alco-holism. Recently, investigators haveassociated low levels of platelet MAOwith the highly heritable Type II alco-holism but not with the more environ-mentally influenced Type I. This find-ing demonstrates that biochemical dif-ferences are likely to exist between thetwo subtypes of alcoholism.Adenylate cyclase (AC) is anotherenzyme that is receiving considerableresearch attention as a possible mark-er of predisposition to alcoholism. Found in the central nervous system,this enzyme is involved in the forma-tion of second messengersintracel-lular chemicals that perform bio-chemical functions that ultimatelyresult in a physiological or a behav-ioral response. Adenylate cyclaseactivity can be stimulated experimen-tally by numerous substances, includ-ing the salt cesium fluoride and thehormone prostaglandin E.,. However,AC stimulation by either of theseagents appears to be significantlylower in alcoholics than in nonalco-holics. The persistence of this effect inalcoholics suggests that it may be amarker of genetic risk for alcoholism,an interesting possibility currentlybeing investigated.Genetics researchers also are pur-suing research aimed at identifyingelectrophysiological markers of inher-ited predisposition. Communicationwithin the brain involves bioelectricimpulses that begin in response tochemical signals. One brain electricalphenomenon that appears to be astrong indicator of genetic vulnerabili-ty to alcoholism is the P3 signal, abrain wave that normally appearsduring the performance of variouscognitive or learning tasks. This waverepeatedly has been shown to beweaker in young boys who havenever drunk alcohol but are at risk ofalcoholism because their fathers werealcoholic. Early studies had found thesame reduced P3 wave amplitude inadult alcoholics who had becomeabstinent, raising the possibility thatthe reduced amplitude may be a con-sequence of and not an antecedent However, P3 boys whohave never consumed alcohol indi-cates that it precedes the developmentof alcoholism and is a potential genet-ic marker of susceptibility.Heritable characteristics that maybe associated with alcoholism canChapter III serve as \"sign posts\" that point to thegeneral location of the genes responsi-ble for the development of alcoholism.Although the characteristics them-selves may not be responsible for thedevelopment of alcoholism, they rep-resent identifiable factors that can beassociated with alcoholics. For exam-ple, if three characteristic markers arealways identified with alcoholism,these markers are said to be linked tothe development of alcoholism. Suchlinkage suggests that the genes for themarkers lie on the same chromosomeand are in close proximity to the geneor genes responsible for alcoholism.Using molecular biology tech-niques, researchers can determine theposition of these markers on thehuman genome. It is anticipated that asufficient number of markers will beidentified within the next few years toallow researchers to produce highlyresolved genetic maps. Genetic mapslabel the position of known genes(markers) on a chromosome. As thelocations of more and more markersare determined, the map becomeshighly resolved. High-resolutiongenetic maps will enable researchersto detect, through linkage analysiswith marker genes, those genesresponsible for susceptibility to alco-holism. Identifying these genes is animportant long-term goal in the studyof the human genetics of alcoholisma goal that eventually can lead to asystemic approach to preventing andtreating alcoholism.Through a large collaborativestudy, presently ongoing at six sitesacross the United States, scientistshave embarked upon a systematiceffort to identify the gene or genesresponsible for predisposition to alco-holism. Scientists will study largefamilies of alcoholics by methodicallycollecting biological material and byconducting neuropsychological andpersonality assessments. This multi-disciplinary, multisite project is 279 expected to lay the groundwork forfuture genetic research on alcoholismby yielding fundamental knowledgeabout possible biological markers andgenetic, psychological, and environ-mental risk factors associated withsusceptibility to developing alco-holism.Genetic research on alcoholism isnot limited to identifying and charac-terizingtraitsassociatedwithincreased vulnerability.Rather,researchers also are interested indefining the factors that appear toprotect certain people from pathologicdrinking, thereby protecting themfrom the development of alcoholism.A notable and extensively studiedprotective phenomenon is the flushingreaction to alcohol observed in manypeople of Asian heritage. The flushingreactionmanifested as a reddeningof the face and upper chest as a resultof vasodilationproduces suchunpleasant symptoms as hot skin,increased heart rate, and lightheaded-ness. This response to alcohol long hasbeen considered a deterrent to alcoholconsumption, and scientists havehypothesized that the flushing reac-tion may account for reduced alcoholconsumption and lower incidence ofalcoholism observed in the Asian pop-ulation compared to many other eth-nic groups.Molecular biology techniques wereinstrumental in identifying the biolog-ical factors that underlie the flushingreaction. Using these techniques,researchers showed that the inheri-tance of an abnormal gene for theenzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase(ALDH) was primarily responsible forproducing the flushing reaction toalcohol consumption. ALDH is one oftwo enzymes involved in normalmetabolism of alcohol. The variantform of ALDH produced from thisabnormal gene is inactive, therebypreventing normal metabolism ofalcohol. When individuals with thisAlcohol Research: Promise for the Decade variant enzyme consume alcohol, thenoxious alcohol metabolite acetalde-hyde increases in their systems, lead-ing to the flushing reaction. Studies inChinese and Japanese persons haveshown that the mutant gene occursfive times less frequently in alcoholicpatients than in the general popula-tion. This finding is important becausethe frequency of this abnormal gene inthe population may help to predictsusceptibility to alcohol abuse.In contrast to most Asian popula-tions, Taiwanese aborigines have ahighincidenceofalcoholism.Scientists have shown that, unlikemost Asians, members (85-90 percent)of the aboriginal group possess a nor-mal gene for ALDH. Thus, theabsence of the abnormal ALDH genemay be a contributing factor to thehigh rate of alcoholism amongTaiwanese aborigines.Abnormal genes found in otherethnic groups also may affect drinkingbehavior and contribute to alcoholabuse in these populations. For exam-ple, scientists have discovered thatthree variant forms (isoenzymes) ofalcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)iden-tified as beta 1, beta 2, and beta 3arefound predominantly in white, Asian,and African-American populations,respectively. Because alcohol dehy-drogenase (ADH) is the first enzymeinvolved in metabolism of alcohol,differences in the properties of thisenzyme could affect the rate at whichalcohol is metabolized in the body.Experimental studies have demon-strated that the isoenzymes metabo-lize alcohol at different rates, andresearchers are beginning to deter-mine the relevance of this finding todrinking behavior and complicationsof alcohol abuse.The disparate distribution of theseenzymes in Asian alcoholics com-pared to Asian nonalcoholics supportsthe belief that alcoholism may have agenetic basis in some persons.40 28However, because many Asians whoexperience the flushing reaction con-tinue to drink, it appears that the pres-ence of various isoenzymes is onlyone of the many genetic factors thatinfluencedrinkingbehavior.Furthermore, environmental factorsthat influence alcohol consumptionmay alter or override the effect ofthese genetic factors on drinkingbehavior. In fact, recent studies havereported that alcohol consumption isincreasing among Asians as a result ofsocial pressure to consume alcohol. Inaddition, the nature of the specificADH and ALDH genes in some indi-viduals may produce a less severeaversive reaction that is less likely toserve as a deterrent in the presence ofnew cultural and social pressures.This new information suggests thatfuture studies will require close obser-vation of both the biological and psy-chosocial factors that influence drink-ing behavior. ANIMAL MODELS INGENETIC RESEARCHAnimal models are an important toolin the study of genetic susceptibilityto alcoholism because these modelsenable scientists to control for variousbiological characteristics observed inhumans. Use of these models inexperimentalstudiesenablesresearchers to analyze potential genet-ic determinants of alcoholism. Thefindings gathered through animalresearch on alcohol, in turn, can beapplied to the study of alcoholism inhumans.Most experimental animals avoiddrinking alcohol under normal condi-tions. Thus, to develop an animalmodel that parallels the human dis-ease, researchers have been faced withfinding animals who actively will seekalcohol. This problem was resolvedwith the development of selectively bred animal lines that differ greatly intheir preference for alcohol. Thediversity of alcohol preference in suchanimals provided evidence that thischaracteristic may be genetically influ-enced and suggested that animalsmay be bred selectively for thisattribute.As the next step in developinganimal models for alcoholism, scien-tists had to resolve whether alcohol-preferring animals drink alcohol forits nutritional or caloric value, or forits pharmacological effects. Studieswith rats bred selectively for alcoholpreference demonstrated that theseanimals not only will work to obtainalcoholpressing a bar more than1,000 times a daybut also will self-administer alcohol directly into theirstomachs. Such actions indicate thatthe rats are consuming alcohol for itspharmacological effects, rather than forthe benefits of taste, smell, or calories.At present, researchers have bredseveral lines of animals that exhibit apreference for alcohol. The use of suchanimals in alcohol research offers thepotential to identify the gene or genesresponsible for the alcohol-preferringbehavior. For example, using a tech-nique known as subtractive screening,scientists can identify differences inthe genes between lines of alcohol-preferring and nonpreferring animals.This research may provide a greaterunderstanding of the underlyingmechanisms of alcohol consumptionand alcoholism.Once the genes responsible foralcohol preference are identified, sci-entists will be able to apply innova-tive techniques in molecular biologyto determine how the presence orabsence of a particular gene influencesbehavior toward alcohol consump-tion. At present, scientists can userecently developed technology tointroduce the gene(s) for alcohol pref-erence (individually or in variouscombinations) into mouse or ratChapter III embryos, producing transgenic ani-mals. If the transgenic animal displaysthe drinking behavior found in theoriginal animal line, scientists havestrong evidence that the transferredgene is involved in the behavioralresponse under study.Transgenic animals also may beused to study the regulatory elementsof genes. Regulatory elements act as\"switches\" that turn a gene on or off.For example, by selectively modifyingportions of the regulatory elements inalcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenasegenes and introducing the alteredgenes into mice or rats, scientists will To developan animal modelthat parallels thehuman disease,researchers have beenfaced with findinganimals activelywill seek alcohol.be able to observe the changes inexpression of the genes under studyand the effect of over- or under-production of that enzyme on drink-ing behavior. Such information alsowill be valuable to understanding fac-tors that control tissue-specific expres-sion of each gene.Genetic variations in an individ-ual's response to the effects of alcoholmay account for some differences invulnerability to alcohol abuse andalcohol dependence. The developmentof selectively bred animals that eitherprefer or do not prefer alcohol hasenabled alcohol researchers to begin tounravel the complex brain mecha-nisms that control the relationship 2941 between genetic and environmentalfactors in alcohol addiction.Although many animal speciesavoid all but the lowest concentrationsof alcohol, alcohol-preferring rats vol-untarily administer alcohol (by oral,intragastric, or intracranial routes) forsome rewarding effects and will per-form various behavioral tasks to gainaccess to even highly concentratedalcohol solutions. Yet, factors otherthan genetic susceptibility may con-tribute to drinking behavior: Throughthe use of certain behavioral induce-ments, alcohol-nonpreferring rats canlearn to drink increasing quantities ofalcohol. Nevertheless, the nonprefer-ring animals continue to consume farless alcohol than the preferring ani-mals. Over the next few years,researchers will use specially bred ani-mal lines to understand the role ofrewarding, anxiety-reducing, andaversive effects of alcohol in the con-trol of drinking.Alcohol Research: Promise for the Decade Animal research also contributes toour knowledge of the medical conse-quences of alcohol use, including ourunderstanding of alcohol-related fetalinjury and fetal alcohol syndrome(FAS). For example, it is recognizedthat not all women are at equal riskfor giving birth to a child with FAS.Evidence (including heightened sensi-tivity among some racial groups andvarying extent of injury in dizygotic,or nonidentical twins) points to thepossibility that genetic factors makesome women or some fetuses moresusceptible and others more resistantto the effects of alcohol. However,these genetic factors remain unidenti-fied. Also unknown is whether theheightened sensitivity is defined bythe genes of the mother or of the fetus.Answers to these important ques-tions can be approached in animalmodels by coupling genetic breedingwith the new technologies of ovumtransplantation. Sophisticated geneticbreeding studies offer the opportunity With new techniques, researchers can isolate and extract a gene from one animaland, as shown above, microinject it into the ovum of a pregnant animal. The develop-ing \"transgenic\" animal begins to express the newly introduced gene. Photographcourtesy of Dr. Carol Readhead.

Ovum transplan-tation, in which a fertilized ovumfrom one animal strain is placed intothe uterus of another strain, offers animportant opportunity to localize thematernal and fetal factors that affectthe risk for fetal injury. THE INTERACTION OFGENETICS ANDENVIRONMENTAs more is learned about alcoholism,researchers are beginning to questionwhether it is a discrete disease withstable patterns of inheritance. If onlyone type of familial alcoholism existsand genetic factors are solely respon-sible for its development, then theincidence of alcoholism in familiesshould remain relatively stable fromgeneration to generation, and changesin environment should have littleeffect on that incidence. The incidenceof sporadic, nonfamilial cases, howev-er, would fluctuate with the presenceof various environmental factors, suchas increases or decreases in trends ofalcohol consumption in the generalpopulation.In a recent study, researchersobserved that heightened drinking inthe general population leads to bothan increase in sporadic cases of alco-holism and a marked increase in theproportion of relatives who abusealcohol in families of alcoholics. Themarked change in populations of indi-viduals who seemingly are geneticallyvulnerable to alcoholism suggests thatsocial and temporal trends in the useof alcohol influence the observedinheritance of alcoholism.In the coming decade, gene-environment studies will play a criti-cal role in shedding new light on thegenetic and environmental causes ofthe onset and progression of alco- holism, adolescent drinking and otherhigh-risk behaviors, and the impact ofone person's alcoholism on other per-sons, such as children of alcoholics,especially with regard to factors thatmay protect those other individualsfrom developing alcoholism. From thepopulation studies of the 1970s,which identified a heritable compo-nent to alcoholism, to the increasinglysophisticated biological and psy-chosocial studies of the 1980s, alcoholresearchers have continued to refineour understanding of the course ofalcohol abuse and dependence. Thisfine-tuning in our understanding ofalcohol-related problems will contin-ue at an increasingly rapid pacethroughout the 1990s, spurred by newtechnological advances and height-ened interest of researchers and thelay public alike in preventing andtreating these major public healthproblems.Chapter III 43 31 lb I ... t6._ I. 44.abge.--- I IVWHYDoPEOPLE DRINK? It has long been recognized thatindividuals tend to repeat behaviorsthat lead to pleasant outcomes.However, the factors that motivatepeople to perform an act again andagain to gain pleasure or to allevi-ate discomfort are not yet fullyunderstood.Scientists use the term \"reinforce-ment\" to describe the process inwhich an effect or outcome increas-es the chance that a behavior willrecur. People learn to perform abehavior, such as drinking alcohol,to obtain a particular outcome, orreinforcer, such as the pleasant(euphoric) or the anxiety-reducing(anxiolytic)effectof alcohol.Alcohol researchers are beginning toexplore reinforcement in theirefforts to understand the processesresponsible for alcohol-seekingbehavior.REINFORCEMENT: ADETERMINANT OF DRINKINGThe reinforcing properties of alco-hol may explain, in part, why somepeople drink. Many persons findthe effects of alcohol to be pleasant:They experience mild stimulationand a feeling of well-being orreduced anxiety, usually soon afterdrinking. These effects may rein-force continued alcohol use. At thistime, scientists do not understandfully the processes in the body thatare involved in the reinforcement ofalcohol use. During this last decadeof the 20th century, however,researchers hope to gain moreknowledge about the nature of alco-holreinforcementandwhatprompts some individuals to seekrepeated exposure toalcoholdespite adverse consequencesabehavior that appears to contributesignificantly to the development of4533Why do people drink?

Alcohol Research: Promise for the Decade Researchers use brain stimulation reward studies to examine the nerve circuits in the brain that control reward. Animals learn to pressa lever to administer low levels of electric current to specific regions of the brain. This stimulation evokes a rewarding sensation.Drawing by Robert Czechowski and Clare Little.chronic drinking and dependenceand to craving and relapse inpatients recovering from alcoholism.Alcohol researchers have usedexperimental animals and techniquesto study reinforcement and the prop-erties of alcohol that encourage peopleto drink. One technique, known asbrain stimulation reward (BSR), hasdemonstrated that reinforcement ofalcohol-seeking behavior can developfrom the property of alcohol that gen-erates a sense of pleasure. This tech-nique has provided valuable informa-tion on the nerve circuits in the brainthat control reward and, perhaps,euphoria. Findings from a number ofdifferent experiments indicate that theneurotransmitter dopamine and itsinteractions with other neurotransmit-ters are essential in reward. BSR stud-ies can be used to measure the effectof alcohol on the reward sensation inthe brain. Stimulating specific regionsof the brain with electrical currentscan produce euphoria. In BSR studies,animals work to stimulate their ownbrains with low levels of electrical cur-rent to evoke a rewarding sensation.When these animals are given alcohol,the rate at which they stimulate theirbrains increases while the amount of46 34electrical current needed to producereward decreases. Scientists haveinterpreted these findings to indicatethat alcohol increases the euphoriaexperienced by the animal. This effect,however, is observed only as theamount of alcohol present in the ani-mal's blood is increasing.Studies with people who consumealcohol in the laboratory have shownthat humans also may experience amild euphoria as the amount of alco-hol in the blood increases toward itspeak level. This knowledge may helpus to understand some of the mecha-nisms by which euphoria may act to reinforce alcohol-seeking behavior. Ifalcohol can produce euphoria only aslevels of alcohol in the blood areincreasing, people may continue todrink more and more to sustain a pat-tern of increasing alcohol levels.Researchers also have demonstrat-ed the anxiolytic effect of alcohol instudies using animal models and aplus maze technique. A plus maze isa track for animals in the shape of aplus sign. The maze is divided intotwo sectionsone with sides, whichshields an animal from open areas; theother without sides, which exposes ananimal to the open environment.Experimental animals placed in themaze usually try to remain within theclosed area, avoiding the sectionswithout sides.Following the administration ofalcohol, however, the experimentalanimals will run freely into the openareas of the maze. Moreover, theseanimals will spend more time in theopen regions than the animals that arenot given alcohol. Researchers believethat this behavior demonstrates alco-hol's anxiolytic effect:Alcoholappears to lessen the anxiety that theanimals experience in open spaces.Chapter IV These observations appear to par-allel reports of many individuals whodescribe diminished tension and anxi-ety as desirable effects of drinking.The desire to relieve anxiety may con-tribute to increased drinking and alco-hol abuse and promote relapse inabstinent alcoholics.Alcohol has a unique quality thatdistinguishes it from other psychoac-tive drugs and that also may contributeto the reinforcement of alcohol-seekingbehavior:It furnishes calories and,thus, may serve as a source of food andenergy to the drinker. Although thecalories supplied by alcohol are\"empty\" calories, lacking such essen-tial nutrients as vitamins and protein,they, nevertheless, may substitute as asource of energy and may affect bodymetabolism. Scientists now recognizethat chronic alcohol consumption canaffect the normal processes by whichour energy and other nutrient needsare met. Accordingly, alcohol prob-lems may be linked to appetite and toappetitive processes.Researchers have just begun toexplore the complex appetitiveprocesses that control hunger, nutri-tional demands, and thirst.In the 074, 4735ei A plus maze is used to study the anxi-olytic effect of alcohol. Althoughrodents normally avoid open sectionsof the maze, they run freely into theseregions after drinking alcohol. Thisbehavior suggests that alcohol maylessen the anxiety that the animalsexperience in open spaces. Photographcourtesy of Dr. David Goldman. coming decade, they will worktoward determining how alcoholaffects these processes and whetheralcohol reinforcement is derived, inpart, from its food qualities.Just as some of the effects of alco-hol may serve to reinforce continueddrinking, other physiological effects ofalcohol may deter individuals fromalcohol use, thus serving to protectindividuals from alcohol abuse anddependence. Alcohol can produce dis-agreeable, or aversive, effects, such asthe extremely uncomfortable symp-toms associated with a hangover.Some individuals experience aver-sive effects after drinking even smallamounts of alcohol. As described ear-lier, persons of certain Asian originsexperience an unpleasant flushingresponse (reddening of the face andupper chest, hot skin, and increasedpulse rate) after drinking alcohol. Thisresponse can be sufficiently unpleas-ant to be a deterrent to excessivedrinking.Scientists are faced with the chal-lenge of determining the importanceof such aversive effects in controllingalcohol intake and in bringing aboutabstinence in alcoholics. In addition,future research may provide insightinto the possibility that potential andestablished alcoholics may be defi-cient in their ability to experiencesome of the unpleasant effects of alco-hol. These deficits may play a role inthe course of their illness. PSYCHOLOGICAL ANDSOCIAL INFLUENCES ONDRINKINGHow drinking develops, continues,and is modified over time is of consid-erable importance to understandingthe nature of alcoholism and, in turn,to developing both prevention andtreatment activities. Researchersstudying these issues are using inno-Alcohol Research: Promise for the Decade vative techniques to explore twoaspects of drinking behavior: (1) theprocess by which people learn aboutalcohol and (2) the ways in which peo-ple make decisions about drinking.Expectancies About DrinkingDrinkingbehaviorcannotbeexplained solely by the direct pharma-cological effects of alcohol that pro-duce euphoria or alleviate anxiety.Other considerations, such as psy-chosocial factors, learning, and envi-ronment, may help to shape drinkingbehavior.Scientists have found that an indi-vidual's beliefs and expectationsabout the effects of alcohol on behav-ior and social functioning play a piv-otal role in alcohol use and abuse.Several studies have shown that peo-ple who think they are consuming Expectancyabout alcohol useis one factor that maycontribute to an adolescent'srisk for developing alcoholdependence. alcohol drink more than those whobelieve they are drinking a nonalco-holic beverage. Further, both socialdrinkers and alcoholics who believethey have consumed alcohol behavedifferently from those who thinkthey have not, even if alcohol has notbeen consumed.Why is this? One explanation maybe that expectancies, which arelearned through social processes thattransmit information about behaviorsand their consequences, are powerfulpredictors of behavior. Indeed, bothadolescents and adults have consis-4836tent sets of expectancies about theeffects of alcohol on behavior. Theseexpectancies, which are expressed byadolescents as young as 12 to 14 yearsof age and probably are formed at aneven younger age, are predictive ofdrinking behavior among all agegroups. For example, adolescent prob-lem drinkers and adult alcoholicsexpect that alcohol will improve theirmental and physical functioning; yet,their nonproblem-drinking peers donot share this expectancy. Children ofalcoholics also hold this expectation ofalcohol, whereas their peers, who donot have family histories of alcoholabuse or dependence, do not.Expectancy about alcohol use isone factor that may contribute to anadolescent's risk for developing alco-hol dependence. Learned expectanciesmay be one way in which risk foralcoholism (that is, family history ofalcohol involvement) is translated intoproblem drinking. Moreover, specificexpectancies eventually may be usefulfor identifying those persons who arevulnerable to developing alcoholism.Not only can stimuli associatedwith the taste of alcohol and its phar-macological effects (for example,euphoria) serve as reinforcers of alco-hol use; about may lead contin-ued drinking. Expectancies may arisefrom thoughts of drinking, frompleasant social situations that involvealcohol, and from the anticipation ofthe euphoria or the diminished anxi-ety that can accompany drinking.Research conducted in the nextdecade will explore more fully themechanisms that underlie expectancyas a reinforcer and the role that itplays in drinking and relapse.Learning FactorsIt is believed commonly that ideasabout alcohol and other drugs beginto develop during middle childhoodand blossom during adolescence. Thus, students in the late elementary,middle or junior high school, andearly high school years usually are thetarget group for educational programson the harmful effects of alcohol andother drugs of abuse. In the past fewyears, however, alcohol researchershave found evidence suggesting thatknowledge about alcohol use isformed much earlier than previouslythought.Investigators have applied innova-tive techniques from developmental,Chapter IV experimental, and clinical psychologyto discover what young childrenknow about alcoholic beverages anddrinking behavior. One techniqueinvolves showing young subjects pic-tures of everyday situations in whichpeople are holding a glass or beveragecan. The children then are asked todescribe what each person is drinking.Results show that children as youngas three years of age know that adultsconsume alcoholic beverages; thatchildren should not drink alcohol; and MIrMINM. Future research studies will examine the family factors that may protect individuals who are at risk for developing alcoholism fromdeveloping the disorder,4937 that men drink alcoholic beveragesmore often than women. Young chil-dren also can correctly identify differ-ent alcoholic beverages, and this abili-ty improves with age. Not surprising-ly, a significant association existsbetween the ability to make correctidentifications and the level of drink-ing in the child's home. Thus, educa-tional efforts focused on high-schoolstudents may come too late.Previous research efforts have pro-vided evidence suggesting that atti-tudes about alcohol are formed earlyin life. During the 1990s, researchersexpect to build on this evidence tomake significant advances in chartinghow young children learn about alco-hol and how this knowledge affectssubsequent behavior, especially inpreadolescent and adolescent children.Family InfluencesMuch of our social learning takes placewithin the family. Hence, scientistshave begun to examine the role of fam-ily in shaping patterns of alcohol useand abuse. The course of alcoholismoften depends on continuing patternsof family life; some family dynamicscan reinforce and perpetuate abusivedrinking. Marriage or a marriage-likerelationship, for instance, has beenfound to modify the genetic risk forheavier drinking in women.Alcohol researchers have set as animportant goal for the coming decadedeveloping an accurate picture of howfamily dynamics affects the beginning,continuation, and modification ofalcohol abuse. The most importantadvances in this area of study willaddress four key issues: (1) the specif-ic ways in which families are disrupt-ed by an alcoholic member; (2) thefamily and other social factors thatprotect persons who are at risk fromdeveloping alcoholism and the mech-anisms by which these factors act; (3)the pivotal role one parent may playin moderating the potentially damag-Alcohol Research: Promise for the Decade ing effects on children of another par-ent's alcoholism; and (4) the condi-tions surrounding the onset of adoles-cent alcohol abuse.In addition tothese issues,researchers will focus on unravelingthe increasingly prevalent problems ofalcoholism in women. Over the pastfew years, research findings have sug-gested that the family processesinvolved in transmitting and perpetu-ating alcoholism differ for female andmale alcoholics. A greater under-standing of these differences will pro-vide new insight into preventing andtreating alcoholism in women.Decisionmaking ProcessesShould I drink alcohol? Should I cutback? Should I seek help? Should Ihave one more for the road? Should Idrive after drinking? Should I ridehome with my intoxicated date?Drinking alcohol entails many deci-sions. Some decisions concern drink-ing itself; others involve managing itsconsequences. Some are made alone; As adolescentstest the constraintsof their andsocial environments,they make conscious andunconscious decisionsto consume or abstainfrom alcohol. others are made in social settings.Some are made while sober; others aremade while under the influence ofalcohol.Moreover, many socialresponses to alcohol use involveattempts to influence decisionmakingthrough such efforts as health warn-50 38ing labels, public service announce-ments, formal educational programs,and legal restrictions on consumingand serving alcohol.Studies of decisionmaking process-es apply two basic approaches:empirical research and formal model-ing. Empirical research examines howpeople actually make decisions.Formal models, sometimes calleddecision trees, are used to structurethe problem-solving processthat is,to identify and measure risk and todemonstrate how decisions are made.Research on decisionmakingprocesses involved in alcohol-relatedchoices among adolescents is exceed-ingly important. As adolescents testthe constraints of their physical andsocial environments, they make con-scious and unconscious decisions toconsume or abstain from alcohol.Disruptive family events, parentalbehavior, peer pressure, and percep-tions about community approval mayaffect their decisionmaking.Over the next decade, researcherswill continue to examine the decision-making process and the role of choicein the emergence of alcohol problems.This new wave of research willaddress such questions as whetherprocesses involved in making deci-sions about alcohol differ significantlyfrom those that involve other issues.With a better understanding of thedecisionmaking process, researcherscan identify more effective methods tohelp individuals make health-promoting decisions about drinking.Further, these studies can assess anindividual's perceptions of the risksand benefits of alcohol consumption.An understanding of decisionmak-ing processes also may enhance ourefforts to establish effective socialpolicies to reduce alcohol-relatedproblems. Economists have theorizedthat a model of \"rational addiction\"can describe decisionmaking involvedin addictive behavior. This approach emphasizes the effects of prices ondrinking choices. The model postu-lates that even alcoholics may beinfluenced by the pattern of prices foralcoholic beverages. Moreover, theeffect of price on drinking behavior isdynamic (that is, lower prices maycontribute to increased drinking thatstrengthens an addiction and leads toincreased drinking in the future).Temporary price increases may affectbehavior differently than permanentincreases. In addition, drinkingbehavior may change with an antici-pated rise in prices. Although prelimi-nary studies exploring this concepthave provided promising results,more research is needed. The knowl-edge gained from these studies will beuseful in the continuing search foreffective policies to reduce the person-al and social costs of addiction.Chapter IV 51 39 52 VTHE MEDICAL CONSEQUENCESOF ALCOHOLISM Liver disease, pancreatitis, cardiovas-cular disorders, and brain damage arejust several of the many disordersresulting from chronic drinking thatclinicians often see in the patients theytreat. Virtually no part of the body isspared the harmful effects of excessivealcohol consumption.Although, at present, no provenmechanisms explain completely howalcohol exerts its effects to producethe multitude of diseases associatedwith heavy drinking, evidence sug-gests that a number of factors con-tribute to the development of alcohol-induced disorders. Susceptibility fordeveloping alcohol-related diseasesseems to vary from individual to indi-vidual. Although much of the evi-dence is preliminary, researchers noware finding that genetic factors mayplay a significant role in defining anindividual's vulnerability.Yet, genetic factors, alone, may notfully account for varying susceptibi-lity to developing diseases associatedwith alcohol abuse. It appears thatcomplex relationships exist betweenthe development of alcohol-induceddamage and the amount, duration,and pattern of consumption. The fre-quency of drinking, the duration ofdrinking bouts, the blood alcohol con-centration attained in the drinker'sbody, and whether the pattern ofdrinking permits time for the body torecover before drinking resumes arelikely to be important risk determi-nants for the development of alcohol-relateddiseases.Alternatively,researchers may discover that the totallifetime exposure to alcohol is moreimportant to defining risk than thenumber of times an individual attainsrelatively high blood or organ alcoholconcentrations.Cofactors also may influence anindividual's vulnerability for alcohol-induced organ damage. Althoughalcohol is the primary cause of most 415,3When alcohol is consumed, it passesthrough the esophagus (1) and into thestomach (2), where small amounts areabsorbed. Most of the alcohol ingest-ed, however, passes to the small intes-tine (3), and is readily absorbed intothe bloodstream with other nutrients.Distributed throughout the body in theblood, alcohol affects various organsand systems, including the heart (4)and cardiovascular system. Althoughmoderate drinking may have somebeneficial effects on the cardiovascu-lar system, heavy drinking eventuallycan cause the heart muscle to deterio-rate. Digested food substances andalcohol are carried away from thesmall intestine to the liver (5), the primarysite for alcohol metabolism. In theliver, enzymes metabolize alcohol tocarbon dioxide and water. Painting byEdward S. Gazsi. Reprinted from NationalGeographic Magazine 181(2), 1992. alcohol-related diseases, the presenceof other diseases or conditions, suchas infections or nutritional deficien-cies, may increase an individual'schance of developing one of the manydiseases that result from alcohol'sdeleterious effects on the body'sorgans and systems.It is still unknown why only certainpeople who drink develop alcohol-related diseases. Despite decades ofslow progress in studying and treat-ing alcohol-related diseases, however,we now can approach these problemswith increasing optimism. Recentresearch, such as evidence for the pos-sible role of genetic factors in thedevelopment of alcohol-relatedpathologies, should produce rapidadvances in treatment in the future. ALCOHOL AND THE LIVERThe largest organ of the body, theliver performs many essential func-tions:It filters circulating blood; itsecretes bile into the gastrointestinaltract; and it synthesizes proteins andother organic compounds vital to thebody. Because the liver plays a criticalrole in many fundamental activitieswithin the body, injury to this organcan produce a wide range of seriousmedical consequences.As the primary site for alcoholmetabolism, the liver is particularlyvulnerable to injury from chronic alco-hol consumption. Because liver dis-eases are prevalent among heavydrinkers, efforts to understand thebasic mechanisms responsible foralcohol-induced liver damage are apriority for alcohol researchers.When alcohol is consumed, it pass-es through the esophagus and stom-ach to the small intestine, where it isreadily absorbed with other nutrients.Digested food substances and alcoholthen are carried from the small intes-tine to the liver, entering by way ofAlcohol Research: Promise for the Decade the portal vein. By acting selectivelyupon the digested material, the livercan remove toxic substances from thecirculating blood.Once alcohol reaches the liver, it ismetabolized initially to acetaldehyde.Acetaldehyde is broken down rapidlyto acetate which, in turn, is convertedto carbon dioxide and water. Becauseacetaldehyde is highly toxic to theliver and to other organs, its conver-sion to acetate is an extremely impor-tant metabolic step. It has been sug-gested that the elevated levels ofacetaldehyde often found in heavydrinkers may cause the alcohol-medi-ated injuries frequently seen in theseindividuals.Chronic and heavy drinking cancause significant damage to cells inthe liver. Cellular injury is presentedas fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, orcirrhosis.Fatty liver, a relatively benign andreversible condition that is common toalcoholics, usually indicates recentdrinking. The condition is marked by As the primary sitefor alcohol metabolism,the liver is particularlyvulnerable to injury fromchronic alcoholconsumption. the accumulation of fat in the liverthat causes the organ to becomeenlarged. Abstinence usually leads tocomplete reversal of this abnormality.Alcoholic hepatitis, a considerablymore serious condition, is marked bywidespread inflammation of the liverand increasing destruction of livertissue. In its most severe form, thiscondition can be life-threatening. 4254Healing usually occurs with absti-nence, although there may be resid-ual scarring.Cirrhosis is an extremely grave andirreversible disease that accounts forover 26,000 deaths each year. In 1986(the last year for which data are avail-able), this disease was ranked as theninth leading cause of death in theUnited States. Characterized by a pro-gressive replacement of healthy livertissue with diffuse scarring, cirrhosiscan lead to death from liver failure ifdrinking continues. However, if a cir-rhosis patient becomes abstinent, theproliferation of scar tissue subsides,and the individual's life can be pro-longed.Impaired liver functioning alsomay have profound effects on otherorgans and systems in the body.Primary hepatic encephalopathy, abrain dysfunction associated withalcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, is anexample of such an effect. This condi-tion, which is marked by altered intel-lectual function and emotion, as wellas by disturbed psychomotor andbehavioral regulation, appears todevelop as a consequence of theliver's inability to perform its manyvital functions.Immune Responsesin Liver DamageAlcohol can damage the liver directlyor through a series of complex bio-chemical interactions that cause thebody literally to attack itself. Themetabolite acetaldehyde is a highlyreactive compound that combineschemically with various proteins andcell membrane components to formproducts known as adducts. Whennaturally occurring proteins combinewith acetaldehyde, their physical andchemical properties become alteredand they appear foreign to the body'simmune system. As a result, theimmune system generates antibodiesto attack and remove these proteins. According to a recent study, 70percent of alcoholics have antibodiesto acetaldehyde adducts. Antibodylevels are especially high in patientswith alcoholic hepatitis, suggestingthat immune response to acetalde-hyde adducts is involved in the devel-opment of alcoholic liver disease.Moreover, acetaldehyde adductsappear to interfere with proper func-tioning of important liver proteins.Thus, the presence of these adducts,alone, may contribute to the develop-ment of alcoholic liver disease.Scientists also are examining therole of cytokines in alcoholic liver dis-ease. Cytokines are a class of smallproteins, produced by white bloodcells, that serve as cell messengers andhormones. Elevated levels of a specif-ic cytokine, called tumor necrosis fac-tor alpha (TNF alpha), mark the pres-Chapter V ence of alcoholic liver disease andmay be involved in its development.Recent studies have shown that TNFalpha production is abnormally highin alcoholic hepatitis patients, evenwhen they are not drinking. More-over, elevated TNF alpha levels inalcoholic hepatitis patients appear tobe highly predictive of early death.Whether TNF alpha plays a directrole in the development of alcoholichepatitis remains unresolved. Theproduction of this cytokine may bethe immune response triggered by theacetaldehyde adducts present inpatients with alcoholic liver diseaseand, further, may be the mechanismby which alcohol causes liver disease.If cytokines, such as TNF alpha, areidentified as causative factors foralcohol-induced liver disease, med-ications that selectively block this 43572I7i (1) A healthy liver.

Photographs cour-tesy of Dr. Emmanuel Rubin. immune response may be developed,thereby lessening or eliminating atleast one factor involved in liver dis-ease. Ultimately, such medicationscould impede the progression of thisserious alcohol-related disease.Research on the involvement ofimmune response in alcoholic liverdisease is still new and requires moredetailed study in the future. For exam-ple, it is not known whether geneticfactors that control immune responseto acetaldehyde adducts play animportant role in explaining why onlya percentage of heavy drinkers devel-op alcoholic hepatitis. Gaining a fullerunderstanding of the nature of geneticrisk factors will enable alcoholresearchers and clinicians to moreeffectively prevent and treat alcoholicliver disease.Oxygen AvailabilityResearchers are attempting to deter-mine whether mechanisms other thanimmune response may be involved inthe damaging effects of alcohol on theliver and the subsequent developmentof liver disease. At present, the role ofoxygen deprivation in the liver isbeing explored as a causative factorfor liver disease. When an individualdrinks heavily, the liver requiresincreasing amounts of oxygen tometabolize the alcohol. Thus, oxygenmay be diverted from other functionalprocesses in the liver to allow theorgan to carry out alcohol metabolism.However, diverting the oxygen toalcohol metabolism may deplete livercells of critical oxygen supplies need-ed for other vital functions. The result-ing diminished oxygen quantities mayprovoke injury to the liver. Moreover,the presence of anemia or blood flowobstructions in the liver (conditionsnot uncommon among alcoholics withliver disease) may exacerbate oxygendeprivation.Adding to this process of potentialliver injury is the finding that alcoholAlcohol Research: Promise for the Decade dehydrogenase, a primary metaboliz-ing enzyme that converts alcohol toacetaldehyde, is more abundant inregions of the liver far away from theentry point of oxygenated blood to theorgan. Thus, the region where alcoholmay provoke oxygen deficiencies alsois the site where acetaldehyde adductscan form.In addition, oxygen deprivationfrom alcohol metabolism may decreasethe rate at which fatty acids are brokendown. This rate, normally reduced inlow-oxygen regions of the liver, wouldbe much reduced in the presence of Researchers areattempting to determinewhether mechanismsother thanimmune responsemay be involved in thedamaging effectsof alcohol onthe liver. alcohol. The effect of alcohol on thisprocess may explain why low-oxygenregions are the sites of fat deposits inheavy drinkers with fatty liver. All ofthese phenomena are consistent withthe observation that alcohol-inducedinjury most frequently occurs in liverregions with limited oxygen availability.Genetic SusceptibilityClinicians have observed that someheavy drinkers do not develop liverdisease, even though these individu-als may drink as much as others whodo develop liver disease. This obser-vation has prompted researchers to56 44question whether genetic factors mayplay a role in susceptibility to liverinjury. Evidence that supports thisidea, which includes studies of iden-tical twins, has shown that if onemember of the pair has alcoholic cir-rhosis, the other member is morelikely to develop this disease than areother siblings.The disproportionate number ofdeaths from alcoholic liver disease inwomen compared with men providesmore evidence for a genetic risk factorfor alcohol-induced liver injury.Findings suggest that the detrimentaleffects of alcohol on the liver are moresevere for women than for men:Women who drink heavily developliver disease after a comparativelyshorter drinking period and at a lowerlevel of daily drinking than men.Although the reasons for varyingsusceptibility between the sexes arenot known, gender specific variationin alcohol metabolism may contributeto the heightened vulnerability toalcoholic liver disease in women. Arecent study found that alcohol dehy-drogenase (ADH), a primary enzymein alcohol metabolism, is expressed inthe stomach in lower levels in womenthan in men. Diminished levels ofADH in women result in decreasedmetabolism of alcohol, and increasedamounts of alcohol in the blood. Theresulting elevated levels of blood alco-hol may contribute to women's seem-ingly heightened susceptibility toalcoholic liver disease.The genetic mechanisms involvedin the production of collagena struc-tural protein and the major proteinfound in liver scar tissuealso maybe a link to understanding disparatesusceptibility to alcoholic liver dis-ease. Collagen is not a single protein;the body produces at least 10 differenttypes. Although this structural pro-tein is found in the healthy liver, theamount increases dramatically in cir-rhosis. Recent findings suggest that individuals with alcoholic cirrhosismay produce a unique variant of oneof the collagen genes, known as type Icollagen.However, the significance of thisfinding in understanding genetic vul-nerability to alcoholic cirrhosis isunclear. Perhaps this variant gene is amarker, identifying individuals whohave heightened vulnerability to cir-rhosis.In studying thisgene,researchers may gain greater insightinto the mechanisms involved in thedevelopment of alcoholic cirrhosisand, in turn, may apply this knowl-edge to improve approaches aimed atpreventing and treating alcohol-induced injury to the liver. ALCOHOL'S DAMAGINGEFFECTS ON THE PANCREAS The pancreas, a large, elongated glandpositioned behind the stomach, servesas an accessory digestive organ thatassists in the breakdown of ingestedfoods. It accomplishes its digestivefunction by secreting into the smallintestine specific enzymes that cat-alyze the breakdown of carbohy-drates, proteins, and fats.In theirchemically simpler forms, these nutri-ents can be absorbed easily by thesmall intestine.In addition to its digestive role, thepancreas also functions to maintainblood sugar levels. Insulin andglucagon, two hormones synthesizedand released by the pancreas, act con-jointly to regulate blood sugar levelswithin a rather narrow range, despitewide fluctuations in sugar intake.More than three-quarters ofpatients with chronic pancreatitis--apainful inflammation of the pan-creashave a history of heavy drink-ing. Pancreatitis, which typicallyappears after 5 to 10 years of excessivedrinking, produces severe abdominalpain that can recur even if drinkingChapter V ceases. Sometimes the pain associatedwith this disease can be relieved onlyby removing the pancreas surgically.However, well before the onset ofpain, the disease is present and is pro-ducing chronic changes in the organ.The association between alcoholabuse and chronic pancreatitis hasprompted researchers to questionhow alcohol adversely affects thestructure and function of the pan-creas. Alcohol stimulates the produc-tion of pancreatic digestive enzymes.This effect, obstruc-tion of enzyme flow through the pan-creatic duct leading to the small intes-tine, augments the levels of thesedigestive enzymes. It has been sug-gested that these digestive enzymesmay become activated in the pancreasrather than in the small intestine,where enzyme activation normallyoccurs, resulting in digestion of thepancreas by its own enzymes. Suchevents may be responsible for thedevelopment of pancreatitis in heavydrinkers.Recent research has provided newinsights into the mechanisms involvedin the development of this disease.Evidence from animal studies indi-cates that alcohol's action in increas-ing the production of a highly reactiveform of oxygen, called oxygen freeradicals, may be one of the underlyingcauses of pancreatitis. In experimentalstudies, allopurinola drug thatappears to block free radical forma-tionsignificantly reduced the severi-ty of the disorder. Further, agents thatdestroy free radicals once they areformed also produced favorableeffects. Broadening these new find-ings through continued research mayenable scientists to develop moreeffective treatment approaches andprevention strategies for this painfuland debilitating disease. 45 Alcohol Research: Promise for the Decade 1 2 si ti (1) Biopsy of a healthy heart. (2) Biopsy of heart muscle from an asymptomatic alco-holic patient shows fibrous tissue and enlarged muscle cells. Photographs courtesy ofDr. Emmanuel Rubin.ALCOHOL'S EFFECTS ON THECARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM The HeartAlcohol's toxic effect on the heart isdose dependent: As total lifetimealcohol consumption increases, mus-cular strength decreases. Clinical testsshow that alcohol can cause the heartmuscle to deteriorate, leading to acondition known as alcoholic car-diomyopathy. Characterized by awasting of the heart muscle, alcoholiccardiomyopathy is one of the mostserious consequences of drinking andcan be fatal. With this condition, con-tractility of the muscle cells decreases,predominantly in the left ventricle ofthe heart (the chamber that pumpsoxygenated blood to the body). Ascardiac muscle fibers become dam-aged or die, the heart attempts tocompensate for the injury by increas-5846ing in bulk and size. Although thisadaptive response remedies theimpaired functioning for a time, even-tually the heart becomes unable topump sufficient amounts of blood tomeet the needsofthe body.Abstaining from drinking, however,can help patients with alcohol-inducedheart disease to recover.Until recently, physicians did notsuspect that weakness of the heartmuscle occurs in alcoholic patientswho do not manifest the clinical signsof alcoholic cardiomyopathy. Newevidence suggests, however, that car-diac function may be impaired in asubstantial number of alcoholics.Although alcohol's toxic effects onthe heart have been demonstrated, sci-entists continue to search for themechanisms responsible for thesedamaging actions. Researchers havefound that impaired functioning mayresult from the disruptive effect ofalcohol on metabolic pathways in theheart. Alcohol is metabolized withinthe heart to a class of compoundsknown as fatty acid ethyl esterscompounds that have the potential toimpede functioning of the mitochon-dria (the energy producing structuresin the cell). The effect of alcohol onthis metabolic pathway may explainhow alcohol abuse can lead to dimin-ished cardiac muscle contractility andto cardiomyopathy.In addition, animal studies haverevealed that alcohol appears to impairthe uptake and binding of calcium ionsneeded for muscle contraction. Theseobservations suggest that alcohol'sactions on calcium levels in cardiacmuscle cells may contribute to thereduced strength of cardiac contrac-tions associated with alcohol abuse.Although the effects of alcohol areapparent with the observable damageon heart structure and function, scien-tists are just beginning to identify andcharacterize the underlying molecularmechanisms. As greater knowledge of Chapter V NormalHeart DilatedCardiomyopathy ElMuscleLA = Left AtriumChambers Major VesselsLV = Left VentricleRA = Right AtriumRV = Right Ventricle these mechanisms is gained throughfuture research efforts, clinicians willbe able to better prevent and treat thecardiac disorders associated withalcohol abuse.The Vascular SystemIn addition to possible direct effects onthe heart, alcohol also may affect thevascular systemthe system of bloodvessels extending throughout thebody. By affecting the release andactions of hormones and other regula-tory substances (such as cate-cholamines and cortisol, among oth-ers), alcohol may modify cardiac activ-ity, blood pressure, and blood flow.Ultimately, such changes may damagethe heart and vascular system.Hypertensionthe persistent ele-vation of blood pressureis a seriousillness that can be caused or aggravat-ed by alcohol use. Chronic drinkingleads to hypertension, although,when small doses of alcohol are con-sumed, peripheral blood vesselsdilate and blood pressure falls. Infact, in many studies, hypertension isapparent at the level of three or fourdrinks a day. Hypertension is aknown risk factor for hemorrhagicstroke and other disorders.As scientists continue to search forthe mechanisms involved in alcohol-inducedhypertension,severalhypotheses are being explored. Forexample, alcohol consumption is asso-ciated with the loss of large quantitiesof calcium and magnesium ions in theurine. Reduced levels of magnesiumcause hypertension in both animalsand humans. Further, diminishedmagnesium levels are associated withincreased amounts of calciumanelement that heightens the tone ofblood vessels, leading to hyperten-sion. Alcohol-induced magnesiumdepletion may promote spasms inbrain blood vessels, impeding bloodflow to the brain. This mechanismmay contribute to the development ofhypertension in chronic drinkers.Clinical studies have demonstratedthat a higher incidence of hemorrhag-ic stroke and other intracranial bleed-ing exists among heavy drinkers than5947A heart in dilated cardiomyopathy,compared to a normal heart. among nondrinkers. Scientists havesuggested that alcohol-associatedhypertension and a bleeding tendencydue to heavy alcohol use both maycontribute to the development of hem-orrhagic stroke.In a recent large-scale study, scien-tists examined the relationshipbetween alcohol consumption and therisk for coronary artery disease inmales.Investigators monitoredapproximately 45,000 men over a 2-year period, excluding from the studyindividuals with pre-existing healthconditions that could increase the riskof heart disease. Researchers found adecreased incidence of coronaryartery disease in individuals whodrank approximately two to threedrinks per day. Yet, these consump-tion levels did not have a favorableeffect on hypertension: The occur-rence of hypertension was greater inheavier drinkers than in lighterdrinkers. More studies are needed todetermine conclusively whether mod-erate drinking is the factor that con-tributes to diminished incidence ofcoronary disease.Even if moderate drinking lessensthe risk for coronary artery disease,such drinking can harm other organsin the body. In addition, the interac-tion of alcohol with medications that amoderate drinker may be taking canproduce very serious outcomes.Finally, moderate drinkers riskenhanced liability to addiction andbehavioral changes that may threatentheir safety or that of other persons. NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERSASSOCIATED WITHALCOHOL ABUSEIt is well documented that excessivedrinking can harm the brain; the dam-age often becomes evident with dis-tinct behavioral and cognitive changesin the drinker. For example, an alco-Alcohol Research: Promise for the Decade holic may experience blackouts,seizures, and hallucinations as a con-sequence of alcohol's injurious effectson the brain. Moreover, heavy drink-ing can seriously impair a person'sability to remember and to performintellectual tasks. The type and severi-ty of the brain damage linked withalcohol abuse, however, can varydepending upon a person's geneticvulnerability, age of onset of drinking,the type and amount of alcohol con-sumed, and diet.Scientists have found that alcoholcan harm the brain in a number ofways. Damage can result directlyfrom alcohol's toxic effects on thebrain. Further, alcohol-related damageto other organs, such as the liver, pan-creas, and heart, can impair properbrain functioning. Finally, poordietary habits that frequently accom-pany chronic drinking can lead tonutritional imbalances that, in turn,can impair the nervous system. Thecellular and molecular mechanismsinvolved in alcohol-induced braininjury are unknown. Because the brainnot only governs basic responses butalso is the center of such human facul-ties as thinking, abstracting, emotions,and memory, any damagemild orseverecan have a far-reachingimpact on a person's daily activities.Thus, gaining knowledge about alco-hol's actions on the brain continues tobe an important goal for alcoholresearchers.Cognitive FunctionApproximately 45 to 70 percent ofalcoholics entering treatment displaysome difficulty with problem solving,abstract thinking, psychomotor per-formance, and difficult memory tasks.Scientists continue to search for themechanisms that underlie theseimpairments. The recent developmentof imaging techniques has enabledresearchers to struc-tural abnormalitiespossibly 4860ing from alcohol abusethat mayaccount for the intellectualand memory functions in many alco-holics.In addition, autopsy studieshave shown that alcoholics have gen-eral brain atrophy as well as specificcell loss in at least two structures ofthe brain that control memory.Heavy drinking also alters certainbiochemical mechanisms in the brainthat may impede cognitive and mem-ory processes. The loss of receptors forthe investigation. Thisloss could disrupt the transmission ofmessages between neurons in thebrain, thereby causing varyingdegrees of impaired memory andlearning.Organic Brain DisordersTwo types of organic brain syndromesmay develop in alcoholics: alcoholicdementia and Wernicke-Korsakoff'ssyndrome. Approximately 10 percentof patients in alcoholism treatmentdisplay symptoms of these disorders.Alcoholic dementia is character-ized by a global loss of intellectualabilities. Physiological and structuralabnormalities are evidenced by elec-trophysiological and brain imagingtechniques. All of these impairmentsare considered direct effects of alco-hol's neurotoxicity. Research findingssuggest that some individuals may bemore vulnerable genetically than oth-ers to alcohol's injurious effects on thebrain.Wernicke's disease is an alcohol-related brain degeneration that pro-duces general confusion, abnormalgaze and gait, loss of muscle coordi-nation, and incoherent speech. Thisdisorder is associated with a deficien-cy of the vitamin thiamine, which isneeded for cellular energy production.Abstinence and vitamin supplementa-tion can reverse this disorder. In the acute stage, Wernicke's dis-ease often occurs with Korsakoff'sencephalopathy and patients arediagnosed as having Wernicke-Korsakoff's syndromecharacterizedby a permanent state of cognitivedysfunction and an inability toremember recent events or to learnnew information. The amnesia mayresult from widespread lesions andstructural aberrations thebrain. Although amnesia is the mostclearly defined symptom, Wernicke-Korsakoff's patients also may havelimited attention, perception, motiva-tion, and emotion.Genetic SusceptibilityIt is well recognized that Wernicke-Korsakoff's syndrome develops insome individuals following a historyof chronic and heavy drinking. Atpresent, however, it is unknown howalcohol causes distinctive injury to thebrain. Given the grave consequencesof Wernicke-Korsakoff's syndrome,researchers and clinicians are quiteeager to identify the mechanismsinvolved in its development.It has been suggested that someindividuals may have a genetic sus-ceptibility to developing Wernicke-Korsakoff's syndrome involving anenzyme that requires thiamine for itsfunction. Research has shown thatalcoholics with Wernicke-Korsakoff'ssyndrome may have a defective vari-ant of the naturally occurring enzymetransketolase. The variant form of thisenzyme (which is a genetic defect) hasan abnormally weak affinity for thi-amine. Thus, vulnerability to thissyndrome may be linked to the genet-ic defect in the transketolase enzymegene and may be exacerbated by adietary insufficiency of thiamine.Chapter V 49 /$t.;-\"T ' 41. VIFETALALCOHOL SYNDROME Throughout the course of history, anumber of clinicians have noted thepotentially harmful effects of alcoholon a developing fetus. Their observa-tions and concerns appear to havepassed unheeded.It was not until 1968 in Franceand 1973 in Americathat scientistsfirst described in published reportsthe common pattern of birth defects inchildren born to mothers who drankheavily during pregnancy. Labeled\"fetal alcohol syndrome\" (FAS), thiscongenital disorder is characterizedby a distinct cluster of symptoms,including permanent physical abnor-malities and mental retardation. Therecognition of FAS set in motionresearch efforts to answer such criticalquestions as:How extensive is the problem ofFAS?What is the relationship betweenquantity and frequency of mater-nal alcohol use and risk to thedeveloping fetus?Can drinking during pregnancyresult in pathology less severethan that of FAS?What is the potential for prevent-ing injury in pregnancy, reversinginjury in pregnancy, or both?What are the physiological mech-anisms by which alcohol causesfetal injury?How do additional risk factors(number of previous pregnancies,other drug use by the mother)influence the effect of alcohol onthe developing fetus?FAS is one of the leading knowncausesofmentalretardation.According to research estimates, 1 to 3babies are born with FAS for every1,000 live births. Among the popula-tion of known alcoholic mothers, therate of FAS increases substantially to a 51Prenatal exposure to alcohol can pro-duce a wide spectrum of conse-quences in the fetus, ranging from thesevere physical and mental impair-ments seen in FAS children, to the lessprominent clinical features seen inthose identified with FAE, to the variousbehavioral and learning problemsobserved in other children whose moth-ers drank during pregnancy. 63 range of 23 to 29 FAS babies for every1,000 live births.Initially, researchers questionedwhether alcohol was the underlyingcause of FAS, or whether another fac-tor believed to be present in an alco-holic woman (poor nutrition, otherdrug use, or inadequate prenatal med-ical care) was the antecedent. Animalstudies that enabled scientists to con-trol for all factors other than alcoholestablished that alcohol actually is ateratogenan agent that producesdefects in offspring before birth.Researchers now have identified awide spectrum of consequences result-ing from prenatal alcohol exposure,ranging from the severe physical andmental impairment in FAS children, tothe less prominent clinical featuresseen in children diagnosed as havingfetal alcohol effects (FAE), to the vari-ous behavioral and learning problemsobserved in other children whosemothers drank during pregnancy.Children with FAS exhibit growthdeficiencies that persist throughoutchildhood. These children have acharacteristic cluster of facial featuresthat includes small and widely spacedeyes and underdeveloped upper lipsand mid-facial regions. Serious neu-rological and behavioral problems,such as intellectual impairment andmental retardation, also are present.Occasionally, FAS children have lessspecific malformations, such as car-diovascular anomalies, genitourinarydefects, and muscle abnormalities.Although FAS appears to occurexclusively in babies born to motherswho are heavy drinkers or alcoholics,researchers have not defined a safelevel of drinking during pregnancy.Even moderate maternal drinkingmay pose risks to a developing fetus,perhaps resulting in subtle effects inoffspring. The damaging effects ofprenatal exposure to alcohol, soapparent in children with FAS andAlcohol Research: Promise for the Decade FAE, can be prevented with maternalabstinence during pregnancy.Still, women who are alcoholdependent sometimes drink whilepregnant despite a strong desire toabstain. Many other women also maydrink and expose the developingembryo to alcohol in the early phaseof pregnancy, before they are evenaware that they are pregnant. Theconsequences that can result fromthese actions underscore the impor-tance of continuing research dedicatedto identifying and characterizing themechanisms by which alcohol causesinjury to the fetus. Toward this goal,scientists are exploring such criticalissues as the timing of exposure toalcohol throughout pregnancy, select Even moderatematernal drinkingmay pose risks toa developing fetus, perhapsresulting in subtle effectsin offspring. maternal factors, effects of alcohol onthe placenta, and alcohol's directactions on the developing fetus. Theknowledge obtained from thisresearch can augment efforts to pre-vent future injury to the unborn childand enhance the development of treat-ment approaches for alcohol-inducedinjuries that occur in children exposedprenatally to alcohol.Although drinking during preg-nancy is never risk-free, it appearsthat the type of injury that resultsfrom alcohol use does depend on theprenatal period when alcohol is con-sumed. In studies with primates,researchers found that injury to theoffspring was more severe when alco- 5264hol was administered at the beginningof pregnancy as opposed to the fifthweek of gestation. Additional researchwith animals has shown that the fetalnervous system may experience sig-nificant injury when alcohol is con-sumed during the \"brain growthspurt\" intervala period that isequivalent to the latter half of preg-nancy in humans.Scientistsstill do not knowwhether the risk of harm to the fetusis associated with the total amount ofalcohol consumed by the mother dur-ing pregnancy, regardless of the timeinterval for drinking, or with the max-imum level of alcohol in the blood atgiven times. Although animal studiessuggest that the maximum amount ofalcohol in the blood is by far the moreimportant of the two risk factors, thetime period in which alcohol is con-sumed also is an important risk deter-minant for the human fetus. Theimportance of drinking time scheduleon fetal outcome became apparent inanimal studies in which the sameamount of alcohol was given to ani-mals over an 8-, a 12-, or a 24-hourperiod. Researchers found that themore compressed the time schedule,the more devastating the harm thatwas caused to the fetus. In humanterms, if two pregnant women eachconsumed seven drinks per weekthe first drinking all seven drinks dur-ing two weekend evenings and thesecond drinking one drink on each ofthe 7 days in the weekthe firstwoman would place her child at fargreater risk for injury than the secondwoman.Research has revealed that alcohol-related fetal injury may stem fromalcohol's actions on the placenta (theorgan that links the mother to thedeveloping baby and provides suste-nance and protection to the fetusthroughout prenatal development).

Such a collapse could lead toshortages in nutrients and oxygensupplies essential to fetal develop-ment, causing injury to the fetus.Additional research in this area in thecoming years potentially will pinpointhow alcohol affects the placenta andwhich steps may be taken to reducethe risk of subsequent injury to thefetus.Various maternal factors also mayinfluence some alcohol-related fetalinjuries. For example, the risk for FASincreases with the mother's age andwith the number of prior pregnancies.Studying the role of prostaglandins(important hormone-like substancesin the body) in increasing the risk ofalcohol-induced fetal injury is anotherconsequential area of FAS research. Inanimal studies, scientists have shownthat the severity of alcohol-inducedinjury to the fetus lessens when drugsthatpreventanincreaseinprostaglandin levels are given prior toalcohol. Because prostaglandins areknown to play a key role in fetaldevelopment, it is conceivable thatalcohol produces injury to the fetus byaltering prostaglandin levels. Moreresearch is needed in this area toobtain a definitive understanding ofthe general relationship between hor-mones and fetal development. Thisknowledge will help to improve preg-nancy outcome in general, as well asto prevent alcohol-related fetal injury.Alcohol researchers are continuingto explore the fundamental questionof how alcohol may directly injure thedeveloping fetus. Although moreresearch is needed to fully understandsuch effects, scientists are beginningto identify the processes involved inalcohol-inducedfetalinjury.Currently, studies have shown thatfetal exposure to alcohol affects thehippocampus, a region of the brainthat is critical to learning and memo-ry. The hypothalamus, a brain areaimportant to the regulation of hor-mones and behavior, also appears tobe vulnerable to the injurious effectsof alcohol. Such injuries may resultfrom alcohol's disruption of the tim-ing of nerve cell development, whichcauses errors in the migration of thecells from their place of origin to their6553Children with FAS have characteristicfacial features. Artist's rendition byJames Sottile, Jr. appropriate location in the maturecentral nervous system. Researchconducted over the next few yearsmay reveal how this disruption ofnerve cells leads to changes in thebrain that can profoundly affect intel-lect and behavior.Animal models have enabled scien-tists to identify and characterize manyof the harmful effects of alcohol onfetal development. Their use in stud-ies analyzing the effects of alcohol onimmune system functioning has pro-vided intriguing findings. For exam-ple, animal studies have revealed thatimmune system functioning isimpaired and hormonal response tostress is reduced in offspring exposedto alcohol prenatally. These prelimi-nary findings suggest that childrenexposed to alcohol before birth mayhave increased susceptibility to infec-tion and delayed healing.Genetic Vulnerabilityto FAS and FAEAlthough women who drink heavilyduring pregnancy are at risk of givingbirth to babies with FAS, not all whoconsume alcohol will deliver a childwith the syndrome. The incidence ofFAS also differs among ethnic groups;both Native American and African-American populations have a higherincidence of the syndrome than otherpopulations. Although the reasons forthis variability are not understoodfully, genetic factors are believed toinfluence vulnerability to both FASand FAE.Studies of alcohol use and preg-nancy outcome have demonstratedthat African-American childrenexposed to alcohol prior to birth aremore vulnerable to FAS than the off-spring of non-African-Americanwomen, despite similar maternaldrinking patterns and identical statusamong the mothers on a number ofother key factors, including nutrition.This suggests that a factor present inAlcohol Research: Promise for the Decade the African-American population maybe responsible for the heightenedoccurrence of FAS.Onepromisingexplanationinvolves the metabolic enzyme alco-hol dehydrogenase (ADH). The rate atwhich alcohol is metabolized differsamong various ethnic groups and canbe influenced by the variant form ofADH expressed in an individual. Atpresent, three variant forms of ADHhave been found: beta 1, beta 2, andbeta 3. The beta 3 ADH variant hasbeen found in approximately 27 per-cent of the African-American popula-tion; beta 3 is rarely found in otherethnic groups. Preliminary evidence Genetic factorsare believed toinfluence vulnerabilityto both FAS and FAE. suggests that the beta 3 form of ADHmay be found at an even greater fre-quency inchildren with FAS.Although this finding must be ana-lyzed further, it may provide a foun-dation from which scientists can learnmore about susceptibility for alcohol-related fetal injury.Over the next several years, scien-tists will continue to explore anddefine the direct and indirect meansby which alcohol can cause harm tounborn children. Future studies areneeded to assess the long-term impacton children's behavior and learning.As a future goal, researchers are try-ing to develop strategies and methodsto help children overcome the defi-ciencies that result from alcohol-induced prenatal injury. These areimportant challenges to alcoholresearchers in the coming decade,because the results will be critical toour future generations. 54Until now, research has focusedon the potential harm that maternaldrinking poses to the fetus. However,recent work suggests that paternaldrinking also may pose some risks tothe fetus and that these risks are like-ly to be distinct from those associatedwith maternal drinking. Althoughthis information is preliminary, itrepresents an important area forfuture investigation. BEVERAGES IMPAIRS YOUR ABILITY TO DRIVE A CAR OROPERATE MACHtNERY AND MAY CAUSE HEALTH PROBLEMS VIIPREVENTIONAND TREATMENT The overriding aim of all alcoholresearch is to produce knowledge thatwill enhance our ability to preventalcoholism, alcohol abuse, and associ-ated problems and to treat alcoholism.In each of the areas of alcohol investi-gation highlighted in the precedingchapters, scientists generate suchknowledge by exploring new researchquestions; by replicating, or repeating,promising experiments both to verifyresults and to determine the extent oftheirutility; and by applyingadvanced experimental designs andtechnologies to reveal previously inac-cessible information.Like their counterparts in otherareas of alcohol studies, many preven-tion and treatment researchers con-centrate on gathering basic knowledgefor developing or enhancing preven-tion and treatment strategies. Others,called applied researchers, test theeffectiveness of these strategies asthey are implemented in \"real-world\"settingsa task that is especially chal-lenging because, in the real world,behavior may be influenced by manyfactors other than the strategy beingevaluated.To control for these confoundingfactors, scientists during the pastdecade incorporated rigorous experi-mental designs such as controlledclinicaltrials, experiments thatattempt to determine a treatment'seffects in a manner that is unbiased byexternal factors. In addition, theyapplied innovative designs such astime-series analysis, a technique thatallows the analysis of multiple factorsover time, and advanced technologiessuch as computer simulation to exam-ine the many factors that can influencethe developmentand the reduc-tionof alcohol abuse, alcoholism,and related problems.Withthesemethodologicaladvances, scientists revealed newinformation about the range of social, 57SResearch currently is being conductedto assess the efficacy of warning labelson alcoholic beverage containers as aprevention measure. Photograph cour-tesy of Stacey Hudson. psychological, and economic charac-teristics present among alcoholdependent persons and about therelationship of these characteristics totreatment outcome. At the same time,they began to consider multiple fac-torsincluding medical, social, andeconomic factorstogether withdrinking behavior as measures oftreatment outcome. These new direc-tions brought scientists to the brinkof concerted efforts to resolve themost pressing need in treatmentresearch: To define which treatmentsare most beneficial for which types ofpatients. Expanding these efforts is acentral focus of alcohol research dur-ing the 1990s.Across the past decade, researchersalso gathered new information thatdocuments the range and complexityof alcohol-related problems through-out society. As the effects of drinkingon a host of physical and social prob-lems (including injuries, disease, vio-lence, homelessness, unemployment,marital discord, and others) becameincreasingly apparent, the focus ofprevention extended beyond prevent-ing alcoholism to preventing conse-quences of alcohol use, including sin-gle episodes of alcohol abuse. Thesedevelopments were facilitated byimproved measurement of alcohol-related problems, improved researchdesign, and sophisticated theoreticaland conceptual models of the systemsof alcohol use that give rise to physi-cal and social problems.These methodological and concep-tual advances will be critical for meet-ing the challenges of a decade thatpromises to produce a wealth of newinformation for further enhancing pre-vention and treatment effectiveness. PREVENTION RESEARCHAlcoholism and alcohol-related prob-lems are believed to result from anAlcohol Research: Promise for the Decade interaction of individual and environ-mental factors. During the pastdecade, preventionresearchersworked to identify the individual fac-tors that can place a person at risk andthe environmental factors that canaffect that risk. Further, they exploredthe interactions among these individ-ual and environmental factors, withthe aim of identifying opportunities toprevent the onset of alcohol-relatedproblems and the onset of alcoholism.Identifying Riskand VulnerabilityScientists studying individual initiated psycho-logical variablesincluding gender,family history, neurophysiologicalcharacteristics, temperament, person-ality, behavior, and social interac-tionsin large samples. One suchstudy, initiated in 1989, is the multi-site collaborative search for the geneor genes responsible for alcoholism, Social learning theory isbeing used to explorewhether changingdrinking-associatedthoughts or activitiescan prevent problematicdrinking behavior. expected during the 1990s to reportresults that will provide insights intothe etiology and developmentalcourse of different types of alco-holism. Results of the genetics collab-oration and the entire geneticsresearch agenda during the nextdecade should enable health careworkers eventually to identify per- 589sons who are genetically at risk foralcoholism and to provide appropri-ate preventive interventions.In addition to genetic risk for alco-holism, researchers are focusing onindividual factors that contribute torisk for alcohol-related problems.Studies of areunderway to determine individ-ual physiological and psychologicalfactors interact with early life eventsto produce risk for alcohol-relatedproblems at various developmentalstages, including adolescence. Sociallearning theory, which delineates theprocesses by which individualsacquire and maintain behavior, isbeing used to explore whether chang-ing drinking-associated thoughts oractivities can prevent problematicdrinking behavior. Among sociallearning that evidencepromise for alcohol-problem preven-tion are cognitive restructuring, anapproach that modifies beliefs orexpectancies about appropriate drink-ing behavior, and coping skills train-ing, an approach that teaches newhabits for exercising self-control whendrinking. During the next decade,researchers will focus on identifyingpromising targets for such interven-tions and on understanding theirmediating mechanisms.Another aspect of understandingbehaviors that lead to alcohol prob-lems involves understanding the con-tribution of environmental factors.During the past decade, researchersfocused on identifying environmentalfactors that affect only a few individu-als (for example, selected families,peer groups, and work settings) andfactors in the broader societal culturethat affect many individuals (forexample, price and availability ofalcohol, advertising, and media por-trayals of drinking). Objectives forresearch during the next decadeinclude developing effective measuresfor modifying environmental risk and testing the effectiveness of selectivemodifications.Targeting AdverseConsequences of DrinkingAn area of prevention researchalready focusing on the interaction ofindividual and environmental factorsis the study of adverse consequencesof drinking. Researchers studyingalcohol-related accidents, trauma,crime and violence, and a possibleassociation between alcohol and AIDSare gathering essential baseline infor-mation about individual and environ-mental risk factors and their interac-tion. Other researchers are testing theeffectiveness of specific efforts tomodify those risks. Some researchdirections related to alcohol-impaireddriving and to alcohol and AIDS illus-trate the importance of this work. Drinking and driving.Current datashow that the percentage of driverswho were intoxicated in fatal crashesdecreased by 18 percent from 1982through 1988. This declining trendwas especially evident among teenagedrivers, who experienced a 36-percentdecrease in the proportion of driverswho were intoxicated in fatal crashes.However, analysis based on a per-miles-driven measure demonstratesthat alcohol nevertheless is involvedin a disproportionate number of fatalcrashes among teenage drivers rela-tive to other age groups. Among plau-sible reasons for this disparity areteenagers' relative inexperience withboth drinking and driving, inadequateschool-based educational programs,and teenagers' ability to circumventminimum purchaseagelaws.Consequently, researchers continue togather information about individual(for example, drinking frequencyamong young drivers) and environ-mental (for example, access to alcohol)risk factors among young drivers andto explore the effectiveness of mea-Chapter VII sures designed to reduce individualrisks (for example, license sanctionsfor alcohol use) and measuresdesigned to reduce environmentalrisks (for example, restricted access toalcohol) among this population. Inaddition, they continue to assess theeffects of minimum-drinking-age leg-islation, as well as community andgrassroots organizational efforts toreduce drinking and driving.Another environmental strategyfor preventing alcohol-impaireddriving is server intervention, devel-oped by the hospitality industry toreduce the likelihood that alcohol isserved to underage or visibly intoxi-cated persons. Server interventionincorporates legislation (dram-shoplaws), education (server training), andchanges in the context in which alco-hol is served (for example, time-of-day, drinking occasion, food-servicepractices) to modify environmentalrisk. In conducting studies of server-intervention, researchers will gatherbasic information about public drink-ing and drinking contexts and identifythe most effective service policies andprograms to modify both individualand environmental risks. Because themajority of driving-while-intoxicatedoffenders do most of their drinking inbars, it is important to determine thecontribution of drinking site toalcohol-related problem outcomes.Alcohol and AIDS.Scientists haveshown alcohol consumptionaffects the are whetheralcohol consumption in persons whoare HIV-infected may contribute tothe progression to AIDS or toincreased severity of immune dys-function associated with AIDS.Psychosocial research has shownthat alcohol use can influence sexualbehavior, and the findings of somestudies suggest that alcohol use mayincrease high-risk sexual behavior. An7959 exploratory study conducted in SanFrancisco, California, reported thathomosexual men were less likely touse condoms following drinking ordrug use, and a Massachusetts surveyof adolescents and adults reportedthat heterosexual respondents whoaveraged five or more drinks dailywere less likely to use condoms thantheir peers who drank less.Although we do not know thatalcohol use contributes to increasedrisk of HIV-infection or to the devel-opment of AIDS, the threat posed bythe AIDS epidemic demands that sci-entists continue to explore any possi-ble biological effects of alcohol use onHIV infection and AIDS. In addition,the AIDS crisis demands thatresearchers seek new informationabout the role of alcohol in risk-takingbehavior and about alcohol use as acoping behavior in individuals withhigh-risk or HIV-positive status.Refining Research TechnologyAmong the new tools to assistresearch on drinking and driving andother prevention strategies is comput-er simulationan approach that,unlike conventional statistical tech-niques, can be used to analyzedynamic social and economic environ-ments in which many factors interactover time. Planners in San Diego,California, recently used computersimulation to document the extent ofalcohol-involved traffic problems,understand the complex system inwhich the problems occur, and projectthe effects of various preventionstrategies on reducing alcohol-involved traffic problems.Together with such new technolo-gies as computer simulation, preven-tion research during the next decadewill rely on several proven experi-mental designs that have developedover time. Many areas of alcoholresearch have contributed researchdesigns that help to isolate individualAlcohol Research: Promise for the Decade and environmental risk factors and toexplore their interactions. For exam-ple, family studies of the past decadeproduced procedures for measuringimportant family variables and gener-ated hypotheses relating certain vari-ables to alcohol abuse among the chil-dren of alcoholic parents. From thiswork evolved such technologies asmultiple cohort studies, multigenera-tional designs, and refined longitudi-nal studiesall of which will be usedin the next decade to examine theeffects of individual and environmen-tal family factors in the developmentand perpetuation of alcoholism andalcohol-related problems.In addition, researchers will usesophisticated prospective studies toenhance understanding of the etiologyof alcohol problems and preventiontrials to test the effectiveness of specif-ic interventions. Because preventiontrials can target and intervene with apresumed risk factor in a healthy pop-ulation, this approach allows forexperimental manipulation that willenhance the value of the research.Prevention trials also can produceinformation about etiology by testingcausal theories.In addition, researchers will availthemselves of natural experiments (forexample, changes in zoning laws gov-erning alcohol sales) to observe theeffects of specific environmental inter-ventions. Natural experiments canproduce information that is both real-istic and socially relevant and ofimmediate practical utility.Evaluating PreventionStrategiesAsnoted,appliedpreventionresearchers assess the effectiveness ofpurposeful actions designed to changeindividual behaviors (educationalprograms, for example) and measuresdesigned to modify the drinking envi-ronment (minimum-drinking-age leg-islation, for example). Some focal 60areas of study for the early 1990sinclude school-based and communityprograms, the impact of alcohol-warning labels, and worksite programs. School-based and community pro-grams.Researchers have shown thatpromising techniques for health pro-motion include targeting individualsand groups at risk, imparting skillsnecessary for behavior change, exert-ing multiple strategies simultaneous-ly, and timing prevention messages toachieve maximum effects.In addition, they have found thatschool-based prevention programsbased on social learning theory showpromise for reducing alcohol useamong young people. Social learningprograms can teach drink-refusalskills, correct inaccurate expectationsabout alcohol's effects, and alertyoung people to misleading messagescontained in advertising and mediaportrayals of alcohol use. Most ofthese programs emphasize the role ofpeers in influencing drinking behav-ior. During the 1990s, researchers willdevelop and refine the social-learningapproach, test new school-basedapproaches, and determine the mosteffective match of age group and pre-vention approach.In addition, prevention science hasadvanced to the point that is appro-priate to develop prototypes for com-prehensive community programs toprevent underage drinking, drinkingand driving, and alcohol use duringpregnancy and to test those programsin long-term community trials.Community trials in other areas ofhealth promotion and disease preven-tion have shown that the potentialexists for beneficial, synergistic effectswhen several approaches are com-bined.Accordingly,alcoholresearchers during the 1990s will eval-uate the feasibility of such trials foralcohol-problem prevention, pilot test program components, and developand initiate prototype programs.Alcohol-warning labels.Public Law100-690, which required that warninglabels be placed on all containers ofalcoholic beverages, created an oppor-tunity to assess the impact of suchlabels on public knowledge, attitudes,and behavior. The findings of researchto evaluate the effectiveness of warn-ing labels on nonalcohol productssuggest that the effectiveness of thelabels may depend on such factors ascharacteristics of the labels and char-acteristics of the population to whichthe warnings are directed.During the next decade, preventionresearchers will assess the impact ofwarning labels on alcoholic beveragesin different situations (including situ-ations in which several preventiveactions are used simultaneously andsituations in which competing mes-sages favoring consumption arepresent) and in different populations.Moreover, they can compare drinkingbehavior before and after labeling andcan measure actual reductions, if theyoccur, in alcohol-impaired drivingand drinking during pregnancy Worksite programs.During the pasttwo decades, numerous strategieshave been developed that aim, eitherdirectly or indirectly, to prevent theoccurrence of alcohol abuse or alco-holism in employees (for example,health promotion programs, quality ofwork life programs) or to prevent theprogression of such problems whenthey exist (for example, screening andtesting programs, employee assistanceprograms). Although some researchhas been conducted on the effective-ness of employee assistance programs,additional, methodologically ad-vanced research will be requiredduring the next decade to assess therelative effectiveness of various typesof programs for reducing alcohol-Chapter VII related problems and enhancingworker productivity, especiallyamong such employee subgroups aswomen and ethnic minorities. Alsoneeded is research to assess theimpact of screening and testing onbusiness costs, worker morale,turnover, and productivity.Few studies have examined howthe workplace may contribute to the Some focal areasof study for the early 1990sinclude school-based andcommunity andrelatedproblems.Consequently, researchers thenext decade also will gather basicinformation about worksite factors,worker factors, and their interactionsthat may increase or decrease the inci-dence, duration, and severity of alco-hol problems in the workplace. TREATMENT RESEARCHThe strategies discussed earlier in thischapter are aimed at preventing theonset of alcoholism, alcohol abuse, oralcohol-related societal problems or atpreventing some combination of thoseproblems. In contrast, most treatmentstrategies are designed specifically toameliorate treatment strategies arefacilitated by a strong research base.Central components of this researchbase include investigations that mea-sure patient factors, treatment factors,and their relationship to treatmentsuccess and investigations that assessthe efficiency with which treatmentservices reach persons in need ofthose services.Over the past two decades,researchers showed that alcoholismtreatment contributes to prolongedabstinence in some patients. However,they also showed that most patientsexperience at least one relapse todrinking following treatment. Itremains to be determined why somepatients begin a period of permanentor prolonged abstinence immediatelyfollowing alcoholism treatmentwhereas others become abstinent at alater time or not at all. Also to bedetermined is whether treatment pro-duces benefits in other areas of socialor psychological functioning forpatients who do not immediatelyachieve abstinence.To better understand the benefitsof alcoholism treatment and toimprove the percentage of patientswho experience those benefits,researchers are working to define theactive ingredients of various treat-ment strategies and to determinewhich patient factors influence treat-ment outcome. Related efforts includerefining diagnostic classifications ofalcoholism; developing improvedtools for screening, diagnosis, andassessment; and improving treatmentoutcome evaluation. As a result ofthese activities, researchers can makeimportant advances toward definingreasonable goals for specific interven-tions and determining the best treat-ments for specific patient types.Further, researchers are working toprovide information that will help toensure that treatment services reachAlcohol Research: Promise for the Decade the population in need of treatment.During past decades, researchersfound that general medical expendi-tures by alcoholics and their familiesare reduced substantially followingalcoholism treatment. In addition, thebenefits derived from treating alco-holics were shown to offset costs tothe general health care system. In lightof these findings, efforts during thenext decade will focus on expandinginformation about the capacities, qual-ity, availability, utilization, and costsof alcoholism treatment services inrelation to the need and the demandfor those services.Also during the next decade,researchers are expected to uncovernew knowledge of genetic factors in Research on reinforcement, dependence, craving, andrelapse; and alcohol-associated med-ical consequences. Translating thisnew knowledge into improved psy-chological and pharmacological inter-ventions and ensuring that thoseinterventions reach persons in needare among the most important chal-lenges of the 1990s.Screening and DiagnosisResearchers have developed a numberof easily and inexpensively adminis-73 62tered screening procedures to identifypersons who have begun to developor are at risk of developing alco-holism. The most commonly usedscreening tools are self-reports andstructured interviews, both of whichmay be supplemented by laboratorytests designed to detect physiologicalchanges often associated with exces-sive alcohol consumption.Although most screening tools weredeveloped to identify active cases ofalcoholism, others are being developedto identify individuals who are atincreased risk for the disease. Duringthe next decade, researchers will con-tinue to develop and evaluate low-cost,rapid screening procedures that can beused routinely in primary health care,educational, and other settings.Resources also are being targetedto further the development of diag-nostic procedures that will providemoreand more valuableinforma-tion for clinicians. These include diag-nostic mechanisms that enable classifi-cation according to severity of alcoholdependence. Mechanisms such as theAddictionSeverityIndex,theDiagnostic Interview Schedule, theAlcohol Use Inventory, and theInventory of Drinking Situations gen-erate reliable, standardized scores thatare useful in treatment planning andtreatment research. Research duringthe next decade should improve diag-nostic specificity, thus enabling clini-cians to design treatment plans thattake account of each alcoholic's physi-cal, psychological, and social charac-teristics, as well as drinking pattern.Biochemical Markersof Alcohol ConsumptionAt present, most physicians base adiagnosis of alcoholism on a patient'sdescription of past alcohol consump-tion patterns and current self-reportedproblems with alcohol. Althoughhelpful, this information, at times, isincomplete or inadequate. Identifying specific, sensitive, andpracticable biochemical markers ofalcohol consumption is a majorresearch goal for the 1990s. The idealmarker would objectively identifyheavy alcohol consumption and alco-hol dependence, thus assisting physi-cians in accurately identifyingpatients who are alcohol abusers oralcoholics, optimally before the onsetof serious drinking-related medical orsocial consequences. In addition, theideal marker would identify low lev-els of consumption, thus also enablingtreatment personnel (and, whenapplicable, investigators conductingclinical research) to monitor absti-nence during and following alco-holism treatment.Although such a marker is not yet athand, researchers have identified sever-al promising candidates. These candi-dates range from several liver enzymes,to modified blood proteins, to the phys-ical appearance of red blood cells.Patient-Treatment MatchingOver the past decade, researchershave discovered that patient charac-teristics can be predictive of treatmentoutcome and that patients with cer-tain characteristics appear to respondbetter to certain treatment formats,Chapter VII settings, and levels of intensity. Inaddition, research findings show thatselectively matching patient character-istics to treatment characteristics canimprove treatment outcome.A large, multisite clinical trial nowunderway is expected during the nextdecade to identify a range of promisinginteractions between patient character-istics and treatment characteristics.This collaborative study employs large,representative sample groups, thusallowing for sophisticated statisticalanalyses and ensuring that results willbe generalizable to a variety of alco-holism treatment programs. Thepatient-treatment matching study willmeasure treatment effectiveness from acost perspective as well as a clinicalperspective, thus producing informa-tion to improve both treatment effec-tiveness and treatment efficiency.Simultaneous with this study,researchers will continue to differen-tiate typologies, or subgroups, ofalcoholics according to clusters ofshared traits. Research on typologiescan provide important informationfor understanding both the causationand expression of various types ofalcoholism. Such typologies alsoshould implicationsfor Patient-Treatment Matching Providence 1Farmington/West Haven Charleston 7 463Project Match is a large clinical studybeing conducted at nine clinicalresearch sites throughout the country.The goal of this project is to identify arange of promising interactionsbetween patient characteristics andtreatment approaches.

Treatment Outcome EvaluationAlcoholism treatment outcomeresearch in recent years has incorpo-rated many refinements in studydesign, methodology, and analysis.Among these improvements are ran-dom sample selection, the use of con-trols, methods for corroborating self-reports of drinking behavior, multipleand objective of treatmenteffects, followup, andsophisticated statistical analyses.Despite these accomplishments,however, scientifically rigorous out-come research remains challengingdue to the complexity of alcoholismtreatment itself. For example, patientsusually are exposed to multiple inter-ventions and multiple caregiversAlcohol Research: Promise for the Decade within a single treatment settingasituation that creates difficulty inmeasuring the independent effects ofany single treatment component.Accordingly, assessment of treat-ment processthat is, the specifica-tion of events or factors that mayfacilitate or impede the success oftherapeutic activitieswill become animportant research issue during thecoming decade. Researchers willexplore factors that influence apatient's decision to seek treatment,remain in treatment, comply withprogram requirements, and acceptreferrals. Additional factors mayinclude treatment program duration,counselor characteristics, and treat-ment integrity (the consistency withwhich specific therapies are deliv- 20111...-ered). Information about how varia-tions in treatment process affect out-come will provide important informa-tion for enhancing treatment services.Health Services ResearchHealth services research developsknowledge of the capacities, quality,availability, utilization, and costs ofalcoholism treatment services. Duringthe 1990s, researchers will performhighly systematic evaluations of alco-holism treatment as it is now struc-tured and will collect cross-sectionaldata on treatment populations, includ-ing prior treatment history, extent ofimpairment, sociodemographic fac-tors, and other characteristics. Suchcomprehensive studies have thepotential to provide information 111113 111111.- Research is focused on improving alcoholism treatment by enhancing current strategies and by developing and testing newapproaches.75 64 about access to treatment, referral pat-terns, payment sources, servicesreceived, treatment participation, andassessment techniques that can assisteffective program planning at theFederal, State, and local levels.Through health services research,investigators also have the potential tomeasure hospital use and costs forpatients who are alcoholic and toexplore the distribution of health con-ditions associated with alcoholism.Innovative TreatmentsEven as research progresses towardunderstanding the brain processesinvolved in alcohol craving and rein-forcement developingappropriate into two general categories: (1)cognitive-behavioral strategies, whichare designed to alter a sequence ofcognitive and behavioral events thatmay lead to relapse, and (2) cue-exposure strategies, which aredesigned to diminish alcoholics'responses to cues (for example, thesight or smell of alcohol or negativemood states) that may precipitate thedesire to drink.Much research remains to be doneto determine whether relapse-prevention strategies significantlyaffect the severity, frequency, or dura-tion of posttreatment relapses andwhich strategies are most effective forspecific populations at which pointsin the treatment process. For example,some cognitive-behavioral strategiesthat have been used only with alcoholabusers may be ineffective with alco-holic patients or may be effective foruse only after patients complete a tra-ditional alcoholism treatment pro-gram. To resolve these questions, fur-Chapter VII ther exploration of relapse-preventionstrategies is warranted.The next decade will produce ahost of new pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions basedon findings in the burgeoning areas ofgenetics, neuroscience, and otherareas of investigation. The promise ofthe coming decade is that each discov-ery brings with it the hope of resolv-ing alcohol problems in individuallives and throughout our society. -k76 77 FocusON DEVELOPINGNEW MEDICATIONS FOR ALCOHOLISM Scientists have made great stridestoward understanding how alcohol actson numerous networks in the brain toexert its effects. This knowledge haslaunched a burgeoning era of researchefforts to develop medications that acton brain networks to impede the pro-gression of alcoholism and lessen therisk for relapse to the disease.Because of the complex nature ofalcoholism, it is unlikely that a singlepharmacological agent will be devel-oped to treat this disease. Rather,researchers are concentrating ondeveloping agents to manage the spe-cific events that occur in the clinicalcourse of alcoholism and complicatethe recovery process. These new med-ications can improve long-term treat-ment outcome when coupled withtraditional verbal and behavioraltherapies. Research efforts arefocused on developing pharmacologi-cal agents to:Modify drinking behavior to con-trol craving and prevent sobriety in intoxicatedpatientsImprove mental abilities patientswith alcohol-induced psychiatricdisorders. CONTROLLING CRAVINGAND PREVENTING RELAPSEThe recognition that certain pharma-cological agents may reduce the desirefor alcohol is one of the most excitingdevelopments in pharmacotherapyand has launched a new area ofresearch for developing medications.Pharmacological agents may reduce 677Research is ongoing to develop differ-ent classes of medications to treat thevarious aspects of alcoholism.Photograph by Scott Sinklier, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. the desire for alcohol in a variety ofways. By decreasing craving, byblocking the reinforcing effects ofalcohol, or by producing aversivereactions when combined with alco-hol, these agents can help to preventrelapse to drinking.A number of neurotransmittersystems influence an individual'sresponse to alcohol and underliealcohol-seeking behavior. Researchfindings suggest that diminished lev-els of serotonin, a brain neurotrans-mitter that affects mood and consum-matory behavior, may influence theappetite for alcohol. Accordingly, sci-entists have begun to evaluate apromising new group of drugs,known as serotonin uptake inhibitors,that act to enhance brain serotoninactivity. These agents may reduceconsumption by abating the desire orcraving for alcohol experienced bymany alcoholic individuals. The use ofthese agents during the early stages ofrecovery, when craving for alcoholcan be extreme, may help the recover-ing individual progress through thisstage and continue treatment.Several of these drugs successfullyhave decreased alcohol consumptionin experimental animals. In studieswith voluntary human participants,one of these drugs, citalopram, causedalcoholic individuals to consume lessalcohol and remain abstinent for agreater number of days.The serotonin inhibitorscurrently available have an impor-tant limitation: People can becometolerant to their effects within a brieftime period. Nevertheless, the posi-tive results obtained from recentstudies indicate that, in the comingdecade, researchers may be able todesign analogs of these pharmaco-logical agents with long-term poten-tial for mitigating the craving orappetite for alcohol.A different class of drugs withpotential for reducing alcohol con-Alcohol Research: Promise for the Decade sumption is represented by the proto-type agent buspirone. Drugs fromthis class usually are used to treat anx-iety; thus, these agents may prove tobe effective in alcohol treatment, par-ticularly among alcoholics whorecently have become abstinent andare experiencing high levels of anxi-ety. Although buspirone is not consid-ered a serotonin uptake inhibitor,researchers believe that its ability toincrease brain serotonin activity mayaccount, in part, for its potential thera-peutic effects.Dopamine, another neurotransmit-ter influenced by alcohol consump-tion, may play a role in the expression Naltrexone is anopiate antagonistasubstance that inhibitsor blocks the receptorthathas reduced alcoholconsumption in humansand animals inprecursory studies. euphoria thatappears to reinforce continued drink-ing.

Naltrexone is anopiate antagonista substance thatinhibits or blocks the action of agentsthat activate the opiate receptorthathas reduced alcohol consumption inhumans and animals in precursorystudies. Nonetheless, further study isneeded to determine naltrexone'smechanism of action.Aversive AgentsOther medications reduce drinkingnot by acting directly on the centralnervous system but by causingunpleasant effects when combinedwith alcohol. Disulfiram (Antabuse), amedication used in alcoholism treat-ment for more than 40 years, acts byblocking the activity of one of the pri-mary enzymes responsible for alcoholmetabolism. The unpleasant reactionresults from a rise in the noxious alco-hol metabolite acetaldehyde whenalcohol is consumed. However,because patients with medication regimensmay not benefit from disulfiram ther-apy, researchers are seeking otheraversive agents that may be morepractical for a number of patients. INDUCING SOBRIETY ININTOXICATED PATIENTS Alcohol produces its effects by influ-encing a myriad of brain systems,making it difficult to find a singleagent that reverses its intoxicatingeffects. Currently, researchers arefocusing on a range of medicationsthat counteract specific aspects ofintoxication (amethystic agents).Although the available agents do notlessen the toxic effects of alcohol on the body or modify drinking behav-ior, they can be useful in certain life-threatening conditions.An experimental benzodiazepinecompound called Ro15-4513, whichappears to block several of the intoxi-cating effects of alcohol, has producedpromising results in animal studies.However, because this agent producesanxiety and promotes seizures, itcannot be used with humans.Nonetheless, the findings on Ro15-4513 suggest that some of the pharma-cologic properties of alcohol can beinhibited with the development ofsafe pharmaceutical agents. Thesefindings lay the foundation forenhanced research efforts in the com-ing decade to develop new medica-tions that induce sobriety. TREATING ALCOHOL-INDUCED COGNITIVEIMPAIRMENTSAt present, verbal, psychological, andcognitive therapies remain the mosteffective forms of alcoholism therapy.However, cognitive deficits, which area consequence of years of alcoholabuse, may interfere with a patient'scapacity to learn (that is, to form newmemories)a necessary ability in alco-holism therapy. This pathological con-sequence of alcoholism may influencean alcoholic patient's capacity to suc-ceed in treatment.Pharmacologicalagentsthatenhance the recovery of brain func-tion may offer a patient the potentialto better benefit from traditional treat-ment approaches. The severity of cog-nitive impairment can vary amongalcoholic patients; the most extremedamage is observed in alcoholics withWernicke- Korsakoff's syndrome, whohave amnesia for recent events and aninability form new memories.Recently, clinical researchers using adrug calledfluvoxamine have4 observed some memory improvementin patients with Wernicke- Korsakoff'ssyndrome. This drug acts by increas-ing the levels of the neurotransmitterserotonin in brain nerve cells. Agentsthat act on the serotonin system offerexciting potential as medications toaugment and restore cognitive in alcoholic patients.Clonidine, a pharmacological agentthat affects norepinephrine, alsoappears to provide some benefit toalcoholic patients with impaired cog-nitive function. The findings on flu-voxamine and clonidine suggest thatpharmacological agents within theirrespective classes can be developed aseffective medications for patients withless severe, reversible cognitiveimpairments.These preliminary results haveencouraged researchers in their searchfor medications to improve alcohol-induced mental deficits. Because thesedeficits limit the daily functioning ofimpaired individuals and interferewith their ability to benefit from alco-holism treatment, the development of8069New areas of research on the molecu-lar biology of the brain may generatedramatically new approaches to thepharmacologic treatment of alco-holism.

MANAGING ACUTEALCOHOL WITHDRAWALManaging alcohol withdrawal is thefirst step in alcoholism treatment.Proper treatment for withdrawal canhelp a patient to become detoxified ina safe and comfortable manner and,further, can foster the patient's moti-vation to enter rehabilitation therapy.The body adapts to heavy andhabitual drinking by counteracting thedepressanteffectsofalcohol:Excitability of the brain increases in aneffort to \"normalize\" brain function.When an individual abruptly stopsdrinking, however, the depressanteffects of alcohol also cease and theadaptive increase in brain excitabilitybecomes maladaptive. This maladap-tive hyperexcitability of the brain is thebasis for acute alcohol withdrawal syn-drome, with symptoms ranging fromrestlessness, anxiety, tremors, irregularheart rhythm, and elevated blood pres-sure to more severe consequences suchas seizures. Delirium tremens, a life-threatening stage of withdrawal thatinvolves profound confusion, halluci-nations, and severe nervous systemoveractivity, also may develop.Although the severity of withdraw-al symptoms varies from one personto another, recent findings suggestthat it may be important to treateveryone who is suffering from alco-hol withdrawal, regardless of symp-tom severity. Inadequate treatmentmay lead to more serious withdrawalepisodes in the future. Moreover,repeated untreated withdrawals fromalcohol may cause damage to the partof the brain thought to be importantfor memory and control of emotion.For more than two decades, benzo-diazepines such as diazepam (Valium)Alcohol Research: Promise for the Decade have been the medications of choicefor treating alcohol withdrawal. Thesebenzodiazepines are anticonvulsiveagents that inhibit brain cell activity,thus preventing the onset of seizures.These medications also counter suchsymptoms as elevated blood pressure,irregular heart rhythm, and tremors.As we learn more about the physi-ological mechanisms involved in alco-hol withdrawal, it becomes possible totest new medications that expresslycontrol these processes. For example,research findings have revealed thatthe production of the neurotransmit-ter norepinephrinea chemical mes-senger associated with functioning ofthe sympathetic nervous system Studies exploringthe underlying mechanismsinvolved in protractedwithdrawal and its relationto relapse will be animportant focus ofresearch efforts inthe coming decade. increases during withdrawal. Thisknowledge has energized the searchfor pharmacological agents that irregularity.Further, atenolol appears to resolvethe anxiety, agitation, and hallucina-tions that may accompany withdraw-al; yet, it also appears to stimulateprocesses in the body responsible forother withdrawal symptoms.Two other drugs that act on norep-inephrine clonidine and lofexidine-81 70have been tested in clinical settings.These drugs (which suppress therelease of norepinephrine) have beenfound to control tremors, elevatedblood pressure, and heart rhythmirregularity. However, they are lesseffective in alleviating restlessnessand insomnia and their usefulness inpreventing seizures and deliriumtremens has not been established.Many of these findings are prelimi-nary. Future research will determinethe full potential of all of these phar-macologicalagentsincludinganalogs of these drugs and newlydesigned agentsas medications fortreating severe forms of withdrawal.Research conducted in the past 10years has provided a greater under-standing of the physiological process-es involved in alcohol withdrawal,knowledge that can be applied in thesearch for new medications to man-age withdrawal. The discovery ofagents that act on different sites andproduce different yet complementaryeffects can help to treat the complexsymptoms of alcohol withdrawal andhasten a patient's entry into rehabili-tation therapy. TREATING THE PROTRACTEDWITHDRAWAL SYNDROMEAs noted, alcoholic individuals canexperience insomnia, anxiety, irritabil-ity, fatigue, and depression during thefirst days of abstinence. When milderforms of these symptoms persist forseveral weeks or months, however,they indicate the development of acondition known as protracted with-drawal syndrome. Protracted with-drawal may contribute to relapsethrough two independent mecha-nisms. First, alcoholics may return todrinking in an effort to ease the dis-comfort of its symptoms. Second, thesymptoms of protracted withdrawalmay interfere with treatment progress by preventing an individual fromfocusing on therapy.Although this syndrome is not wellunderstood, researchers have foundthat its symptoms have a physiologi-cal basis. The hyperexcitability of thebrain that is observed during acutewithdrawal can continue long after anindividual stops drinking.Although limited progress has beenmade toward developing medicationsfor protracted alcohol withdrawal,experience with treatments for otherdrug addictions is encouraging. Forexample, some medications in theantidepressant class appear to lessensymptoms of protracted withdrawalamong cocaine dependent persons.Studies exploring the underlyingmechanisms involved in protractedwithdrawal and its relation to relapsewill be an important focus of researchefforts in the coming decade. Thesestudies will provide the basis fordeveloping medications to treat pro-tracted withdrawal symptoms. TREATING COEXISTINGPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERSAlcoholics often display symptomsassociated with such psychiatric dis-orders as depression, anxiety, manic-depression, and antisocial personality.Some of these symptoms may resultfrom the acute and chronic effects ofalcohol consumption. In some cases,however, the symptoms suggest acoexisting psychiatric problem.Some alcoholics use alcohol toalleviate psychiatric symptoms. Inaddition, alcoholism directly or indi-rectly may increase the risk for devel-oping certain psychiatric problems.Regardless of the basis of the drink-ing or the psychiatric symptoms,researchers are trying to determinethe effect that treatment of a coexist-ing psychiatric problem may have ondrinking outcome. New medicationsto treat psychiatric disorders alsomay be effective for treating alco-holism. Conversely, medicationsused to treat alcoholism may proveto be useful in treating coexistingpsychiatric disorders. Continuinginvestigations of the relationshipbetween alcoholism and coexistingpsychiatric problems will be criticalfor the treatment of both alcoholismand associated psychiatric disorders. 82 71 EPILOG As we begin a new era in alcoholresearch, we are inspired by theimpressive progress made in the fieldover the past 20 years. Today, theknowledge gained from prior studiesis providing researchers with a soundframework for understanding thecauses and consequences of alcoholabuse and alcoholism. Despite ourmany advances, however, these disor-ders continue to be devastating andcostly health problems that affect mil-lions of individuals.The seriousness of alcohol prob-lems is heightened by the limitedresults obtained from current treat-ment measures for alcoholism.Although current approaches pro-mote prolonged abstinence in somepatients, the rate of relapse to drink-ing is still too high. It is only throughresearch that we can construct effec-tive treatment strategies that will helpthose overwhelmed by the power ofalcohol addiction to achieve long-term sobriety. Scientists within themany biomedical and psychosocialdisciplines of the alcohol field areworking collectively toward this goal.Their concerted efforts to gain addi-tional knowledge of the effects ofalcohol on the body, the nature ofaddiction, and the genetic and envi-ronmental factors that increase therisk for alcoholism and related med-ical pathologies will bring us closer toconceiving effective methods for alco-holism treatment.Central to this pursuit are studiesaimed at developing new medicationsto treat alcoholism. In the comingdecade, researchers will be searchingfor pharmacological agents that act onbrain networks to impede the progres-sion of alcoholism and lessen the riskfor relapse. Although it is doubtfulthat one agent can be developed totreat this disease, there is promise thatpharmacological treatments coupledwith traditional behavioral therapiescan improve long-term treatmentoutcome.Powerful new technologies willopen many new avenues of investiga-tionduringthenextdecade.Noninvasive neuroimaging tech-niques, which offer the unpreceden-ted opportunity to look into the living83 72brain, are enabling scientists to probethe effects of alcohol on brain struc-tures and functions. Tools in molecu-lar biology are facilitating the searchfor genetic factors that predisposeindividuals to alcoholism and alcohol-related pathologies. Sophisticatedcomputer models, which analyze thedynamic social and economic envi-ronments with which alcohol abuseoccurs, are allowing researchers toproject potential outcomes of variousprevention strategies.Building upon the strong founda-tion laid by past findingsand galva-nized by new technologiesalcoholresearchers will have exceptionalopportunities to make new discoveriesabout alcohol abuse and alcoholism inthe coming decade. Technology andincreased knowledge will empowerresearchers to solve many of the unan-swered questions in alcohol researchand ultimately to effectively preventand treat alcohol problems.
