Several strategies and road maps are being drawn to carry forward merits of this science so as to meet the current day health needs and mainstream its core strengths alongside through research & development in this country and across the globe. The core component of clinical research comprise of validation of the fundamental principles of Ayurveda; Validation and development of diagnostic/assessment tools ; standardization and validation of the therapeutic procedures and generation of scientific evidence of safety and efficacy of Ayurveda formulations and approaches and generation of new formulations taking leads from classical texts, contemporary scientific and pharmacological leads for important diseases of National importance based on strength of Ayurveda and from the folklore collected from various parts of India by the Council. The Council undertakes validation of classical Ayurvedic formulations already in the healthcare system through clinical studies to generate evidence on clinical efficacy and safety and scientific validation of new combinations (coded drugs) collected through folklore claims from various parts of the country, under drug development. The classical Ayurvedic formulations are already in the healthcare system and coded Ayurvedic drugs are made available into the healthcare system through systematic process of drug development viz. drug standardization and quality control, preclinical safety/toxicity studies and biological activity studies (as appropriate) and clinical trials as per requirement. The Council is working toward validation of these drugs in the diseases of National importance. So far more than 30 diseases of National importance have been studied upon with more than hundred classical drugs in different combinations. The council is also working hard to revive the traditional systems and knowledge prevailing among tribes and in villages through collection of their folklore claims for various ailments and is working towards validation of these claims so the knowledge can be used for masses. The Council has identified classical Ayurveda formulations for identified disease conditions referring from Ayurvedic pharmacopeia /Ayurvedic Formulary of India, Essential Drug list of ASU medicines (2013), Ministry of AYUSH and other Ayurveda classical texts. These formulations are being validated through Council's institutes engaged in clinical research in i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i I l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l a phased manner. Some of the formulations are clinically validated for different disease conditions and some are used in different combinations for the same or different disease conditions. In the recent past the Council has generated scientific evidence on safety and efficacy of approximately 82 classical Ayurvedic formulations on more than 32 diseases/conditions viz. Allergic Conjunctivitis, Bronchial Asthma, Chronic Bronchitis, Cognitive Deficit, Dry Eye Syndrome, Dyslipidemia, Type II Diabetes Mellitus, Essential Hypertension, Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Iron Deficiency Anemia, Menopausal Syndrome, Osteoarthritis, Obesity, Osteoporosis/Osteopenia, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Rasayana for healthy ageing, Dysmenorrhea, Psoriasis, Gout, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, Hemorrhoids, Mental Retardation, Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Computer Vision Syndrome etc. Further, validation of approximately 35 classical Ayurvedic formulations is continuing for generation of scientific evidence on safety and efficacy on 14 diseases/conditions viz. viz. Psoriasis, Urolithiasis, Uterine Fibroids, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Hemorrhoids, Osteoarthritis, Gout, Osteopenia/Osteoporosis, Obesity, Iron Deficiency Anemia, Menopausal Syndrome, Cervical Spondylosis, Cognitive Deficit and Chronic Allergic Conjunctivitis in various institutes of the Council engaged in clinical research. The research outcomes of these studies are being published in journals especially in council's official publication JRAS (Journal of Research in Ayurvedic Sciences) and JDRAS (Journal of Drug Research in Ayurvedic Sciences) for wider dissemination. The evidence on clinical efficacy and safety of Ayurvedic formulations which are vogue and available in the market is highly useful to practitioners and consumers for their rational use. The evidence of their safety and rational use will also strengthen integration of Ayurveda with other systems of medicine and also help in convincing scientific community across the world which may also improve its market in the country and world at large. New drug development The Council is engaged in drug development of new/coded formulations. Till date, 12 technologies such as Ayush 64 for malaria, Ayush SG for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Ayush 82 for Diabetes mellitus have been developed and commercialized through National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) for wider public utility. CCRAS has undertaken the development of the various coded formulations for different disease conditions viz. AYUSH Manas for Mental retardation/cognitive deficit, AYUSH i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i I l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l QOL 2C for improving Quality of Life of Cancer patients, AYUSH Rasayan A & B in geriatric health, AYUSH Cl wound A Asthma, AYUSH D for Type II Diabetes Mellitus, Carctol S for Cancer, AYUSH K1 for Chronic Kidney Diseases, Ayush coded drug for fatty liver degeneration and Ayush coded drug for hepato-protection as adjuvant to ATT which are at different phases of drug development. These studies are being conducted in collaboration with reputed institutes like AIIMS New Delhi, NIMHANS Bengaluru, BHU, ICMR and St. John's Medical College Bengaluru etc. Council is also putting efforts in validation and standardization of various fundamental principles and diagnostic tools of Ayurveda to further strengthen the Ayurveda system of medicine. Presently validation work of prakriti assessment tool and Validation and reliability testing of Ayurveda Diagnostic Tools is going on. The council has also laid its vision document 2030 with short term goal and long term goal in for achieving its objectives and further strengthening of scientifically validated Ayurveda for achieving the ultimate goal of 'Health fo r alV The council is dedicated dissemination of its research finding through monographs and book publications.

These systems were developed by ancient scholars on the basis of their own philosophy, oriental methodologies and practices prevalent in that era and have popularised and almost completed it in all aspects as a system of medicine. The advent of foreign invasions and cross cultural interaction had definite impact on these systems. The beginning of twentieth century saw efforts to revive these systems. The members of the Imperial Legislative Council got the resolution of investigations and recognition of these systems was accepted in the year 1916. The Indian National Congress also passed similar resolution in 1920. This led to establishment to number of colleges of Ayurveda. In the post independence era, the efforts to develop research gained momentum. As per recommendation of the various Committees, grant-in-aid projects were sanctioned to selected colleges. The Central Council for Ayurvedic Research as an Advisory body was established in 1962 and finally the Central Council for Research in Indian medicine & Homoeopathy (CCRIM&H) was established in 1969. This Council initiated research programmes in the Indian systems of Medicine & Homoeopathy in different parts of the country and started coordination at the National level for the first time. The Central Council for Research in Ayurveda & Siddha (CCRAS), an apex body for the formulation, coordination and development of research in Ayurveda & Siddha on scientific lines was established in March 1978 after reorganization of CCRIM&H. The Minister of Health & Family Welfare is the President of the Governing Body of the Council while the Joint Secretary chairs the Standing Finance Committee. The Scientific /Research Programmes are supervised by the respective Scientific Advisory Committee chaired by eminent scholars of the system. The Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences is a Registered Society under Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860 on 29.07.2011 (Formerly Registered as Central Council for Research in Ayurveda and Siddha on 30th March, 1978).VOLUME-I G lim pses of CCRAS con trib utions - (50 G lorious years) I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I Research areas The Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic sciences (CCRAS), an autonomous body under Ministry of AYUSH, Govt, of India is apex body in India for undertaking, coordinating, formulating, developing and promoting research on scientific lines in Ayurvedic sciences.

To consolidate the use of Ayurveda classical formulations, backed by proper scientific evidence. The Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences has undertaken clinical validation of Ayurvedic formulations/therapies in certain identified diseases/conditions of National importance, the council has undertaken multicentre observational studies across its peripheral institutes that comprise musculo skeletal and jwara slipada (Filariasis). The principle objective of these multicentre observational studies was to ascertain the clinical efficacy and safety of classical Ayurvedic formulations and therapies, observing the protocols and parameters with modest clinical and laboratory facilities available at CCRAS peripheral institutes. Further the Ministry of AYUSH (then Dept, of AYUSH, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare), has emphasized on generation of scientific evidence on safety and efficacy of classical Ayurveda formulations, formulations for which standards are available in API and medicines reflecting in Essential Drug List (EDL) of Ayurveda. Further broadly, the assessment of response in certain studies has been categorized as Good response (75% and above relief in symptomatology and laboratory parameters tending towards normalcy), Fair response (50% and above relief in symptomatology and significant improvement in laboratory parameters), Poor response (25% and above relief in presenting symptomatology and insignificant improvement in laboratory parameters) and No response Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I (no relief in presenting symptomatology of the disease) as specified in protocols for periodical assessment. The council has already validated 80 classical formulations for different diseases. At present validation process of 34 classical Ayurveda formulations are in progress and many more are under pipeline at various stages. Following are the diseases wise categorisation of various studies for safety and efficacy done by the council since inception for validation of classical drugs.VOLUME-I Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) 8 1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI 2.1.-AMAVATA (RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS) Background Rheumatoid arthritis ( Amavata ) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease that causes pain, swelling, stiffness, joint destruction & its functional disability. It is defined as a chronic multisystem disease characterized by persistent inflammatory synovitis, usually involving peripheral joints in a symmetric distribution with a potential to cause cartilage destruction and bone erosions. As the etio-pathogenesis of Rheumatoid arthritis ( Amavata ) is unknown, there is no specific treatment. The Ayurvedic treatment of Amavata (Rheumatoid arthritis) is being increasingly recognized as an alternative approach to its treatment. According to Ayurveda, Amavata (Rheumatoid arthritis) is caused due to malfunctioning of the gastro intestinal system. It is a very painful disease and causes great discomfort during its aggravation period. The main cause of this disease is formation of Ama (a toxic substance) due to Agnimandya. The etiological factors such as viruddhahara (improper and irregular dietary habits), Viruddhachesta (improper physical and psychological activities), mandagni (improper digestion and metabolism), sedentary habits and exercise immediately after food lead to the formation of Ama which gets circulated by vyan vayu to various kapha sthana especially joints and causes inflammation which leads to disease Amavata and it may be correlated with Rheumatoid arthritis due to its similar symptomatology. The cardinal features of Amavata are swelling and severe pain that seems to be of scorpion bite over the joints like hands and legs (especially knee, ankle wrist, metacarpals and metatarsals). The other symptoms are body pain, loss of appetite, excessive thirst, laziness, heaviness of the body and fever. Based on the cardinal feature and other associated features, many effective regimens are described in Ayurvedic classics. Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of Amavata: Study 1: Shunthi Guggulu- A combination of equal parts of powder of dry rhizomes Shunthi (Zingiber officinale) and gum resin of Guggulu (Commiphora wightii), has been given internally in the dose of 2 gm. three times a day. Valuka Sveda (dry fomentation) was applied on the affected parts. The observations made on 497 patients showed that about 2/3rd patients (67%) have very good effect under a course of 6-week treatment. General functional capability and improvement in general condition of the patients was noticed.VOLUME-I Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I Study 2: A combination of 3 drugs Mahayograja guggulu 1 gm three times a day with warm water, Vaishwanar chuma 3gm. twice daily after meal and Simhanada guggulu 2 gm at bed time has been studied on 518 patients. Local fomentation was also given.The results indicate that about 60% of the patients have shown definite improvement in their clinical symptoms. Study 3: Aswagandha (Withania somifera Dunal) chuma- A combination thrice a day and Eranda taila 15 ml. at bed time, has been administered. The dry fomentation (Valuka Sveda) has also been given for the total duration of 6 weeks. 57% of the patients have shown improvement. Study 4: Vachadighana-Haridradighana groups of medicines mentioned in Sushruta Samhita have been administered in the dose of 3 gm. three times a day with warm water in two separate groups of the patients. Vettumaran Gutika 1 tablet three times a day was given internally. The external application of the dry fomentation (Valuka Sveda) was given. The results indicate positive efficacy in about 80% of patients.

The pain of sciatic nerve originates from lower back and radiates towards buttocks, back of thighs, below the knee up to the foot. The pain is usually get worse on prolonged sitting, standing and walking and relived by lying down.The sciatica mostly affects the early and middle aged peoples, heavy weight lifters and persons who are engaged in the occupations in which continuous pressure on back is used. The common causes of sciatica are herniated disc, spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, piriformis syndrome, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and sometimes during pregnancy. As the sciatica is considered as a manifestation of underlying diseases, the line of treatment is to treat underlying cause which irritate/ compress the sciatic nerve. Besides this, bed rest, physiotherapy, analgesics and muscle relaxants are being used. Sometimes surgical intervention may be required. In Ayurveda, Gridhrasi (Sciatica) is considered as one of the important Vata Vyadhi (Neurological disorders). The disease is characterized by stiffness, pain and pricking sensation initially at the hip and gradually radiating towards waist, back, thigh, knee and calf region along with frequent pulsation at these sites. Two types of Gridhrasi have been described viz. Vataja and Vatakaphaja. In both the main vitiated dosha is Vata. Various approaches of the treatment including Panchakarma therapies have been recommended in Ayurvedic Classical texts. Snehopachara (internal and external oleation) Swedana (sudation) and mild Samshodhana (clensing) is considered as the foremost treatment for Vata diseases. Among pachakarma, Vastikarma (therapeutic enema) is best suited for Vata predominant diseases in particular. Vastikarma is a procedure in which a mixture of medicine in suspension is directly administered into the Pakwashaya (large Intestine) through anal route by using specialized instrument. In the present study different Ayurvedic procedures and medicines were used. Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of Gridhrasi'. Study 1: The purified Bhallataka (marking nut) as per the procedure laid down in the Ayurveda has been given to the patients in gradually increasing doses and then gradually tapering the dose to the initial dose. Apart from such a course, the purified Bhallataka hasVOLUME-I 17 Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I also been given in a uniform dose of 250 mg. to 500 mg. three times a day to 128 patients.The effect of the Bhallataka has been assessed on the basis of clinical improvement and functional tests. The observations indicate encouraging response and 52% of the patients have shown efficacy. Study 2: The Trayodasharga Guggulu 1 gm. three times a day with warm water and Visatinduka Vati 250 mg. three to four times a day has been given internally along with external application of oil massage and fomentation. Thestudy was conducted on 128 patients. The results have been assessed on the basis of clinical features and functional capacity of the patients. 57% of the patients showed encouraging response. Study 3: The Panchakarma regimen given consists of Snehana (Oleation), Svedana (Sudation) and Vasti (Medicated enema). Different drugs have been used for the preparation of massage oil and decoction for each study. A number of studieshave been conducted with different drugs on a large number of patients. The effect of the therapy was encouraging and 75-100% patients under different studied have shown improvement. Study 4: Open label Interventional study was done with Hingutriguna Taila - 10 ml to 15 ml thrice a day for 21 days. The study was done at 6 centres, viz. Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Eye Diseases, Lucknow, Regional Ayurveda Research Institute, Gangtok, Regional Ayurveda Research Institute, Itanagar, National Ayurveda Research Institute for Panchakarma, Cheruthuruthy, Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Cardiovascular Diseases, New Delhi and at Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Infectious Diseases, Patna. In the study total 211 cases were studied. Out of them, 21 patients, 63 patients, 54 patients, 16 patients and got good response, fair response, poor response and no response respectively. 57 patients were dropped out from the trial. Study 5: Open label Interventional study was done with Hingutriguna Taila - 10 ml. to 15 ml. thrice a day for 21 days, Dasamoola Bala Kwatha 20 ml. thrice a day for 21 days and Nirgundi Patra pinda Sweda twice a day for 21days. The study was done at two centres, viz. Regional Ayurveda Research Institute, Itanagar and at National Ayurveda Research Institute for Panchakarma, Cheruthuruthy.

In classical books of Ayurveda the terms Pakshaghata, Pakshavadha and Ekangaroga are used to denote the clinical condition in various contexts. Charaka included Pakshaghata in the list of nanatmajavyadhi among the eighty types of vata disorders which are considered as mahavyadhi, which is (difficult to cure). Pakshaghata may vary in severity from a weakness in a limb with slight numbness to a profound loss of functions in half of the body. The mode of onset, organs involved, spread of impairment, functions impaired i.e., motor, sensory and mental function may vary considerably from case to case according to the underlying etiology. According to modem terminology, hemiplegia is usually the sequel of cerebro-vascular disorders or stroke and most cerebrovascular diseases are manifested by the abrupt onset of a focal neurologic deficit. The clinical manifestations of stroke are highly variable because of the complex anatomy of the brain and its vasculature. Features other than the weakness decreased movement controlled, clonus, spasticity; exaggerated deep tender refers and decreased endurance. Hemiplegia is the leading cause of disability resulting into enormous socio economic implications. The general pathology described for Pakshaghata is dhatukshaya (nutritional deficiency) and margavarodha (obstruction in the pathways). In Pakshaghata both the above factors have definite role in the pathogenesis. The circulatory disturbance affected due to these leads to the impairment in the supply of nutrition to the brain cells which is the vital part ( Marma ) and controlling Centre of motor and sensory functions. The clinical research conducted in hemiplegia with different treatment schedule in various study groups revealed that the complete recovery from the illness is very rare; however the therapy was useful to improve the functional ability and quality of life of the disabled patients. Parpalegia indicates paralysis of both lower extremities. This mayoccur in diseases of spinal cord, spinal roots peripheral nerver or maybe hysterical. If the onset is acute, it may be difficult to distinguishspinal from neuropathic paralysis because the element of spinal shockmay result in abolition of reflexes and flacidity.VOLUME-I 21 Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I Walking disability due to the drawing up (contractions) of Kandara (muscle tendon) of one leg by deranged Vayu situated at Kati (lumbosacral) region is the main symptom of Kharya (monoplegia) andwhen both legs are similarly affected the disease is called Pangw(Paraplegia). It originates at Kati due to the vitiated Vata, (a humor)probably the Katyasrita Vata - that is Apanavayu is involved. The main complaints are disturbed visceral reflexes (micturition anddefection), loss of sensation, inability to walk due to Apanavaigunya. The definition of Vata itself explains that the normal function of Vata isthe regulation of motor and sensory functions. Therefore, vitiation of Vata leading to the onset of a disease usually manifests as an impairment of these functions. Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of pakshaghata'.

The secondary pathophysiologic changes occur in multiple organ systems due to metabolic dysregulation associated with Diabetes mellitus. The two categories of diabetes are type I or Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM) & type II or Non Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM). Complete or near total insulin deficiency is found in type I. Type II diabetes mellitus is characterized by variable degree of insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion and increased glucose production. The classical symptoms of diabetes mellitus are polyuria (frequent urination), polydipsia (increased thirst) and polyphagia (increased hunger). Diabetes mellitus is one of the major global health problems with an increase in worldwide prevalence from about 30 million cases in 1985 to 177 million cases in 2000 and world wide estimates project that more than 360 million individuals will have diabetes by the year 2030. The prevalence of the disease increases with the age and affects men and women similarly but is slightly greater in men > 60 years. Types II diabetes mellitus is increasing more rapidly due to obesity caused by sedentary life habits and changed life style. Insulin is the only treatment for type I diabetes and conventional modem medicine provides a number of drugs for controlling the blood sugar level in the patients of diabetes mellitus type II. However, with the prolonged treatment doses of the drugs often needs to be increased to control the blood sugar level and a time comes when patient has to be switched over to insulin. Such patients become cases of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. With a view to help the suffering community there is a need to find a safer drug, which can be used to control the blood sugar level to use safely for longer periods. Madhumeha has been vividly described in classical Ayurvedic Texts. A number of predisposing and etiological factors and complications of this disease are described in great detail. Acording to Ayurveda, Madhumeha is a type of Prameha. All types of Prameha ultimately lead to Madhumeha. The food items and life styles which vitiate kapha may predispose Prameha. Sedentary life style, excessive sleep and over consumption of curd, meat soups, fat rich food, milk, milk products, jaggery preparations etc. causes Prameha. Ayurveda emphasizes on the elimination of the etiological factors as the main principle ofVOLUME-I Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) 26 1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI treatment of the disease. Accordingly regulation of diet and exercise has been laid special emphasis. The use of herbal and herbo-mineral preparations for the treatment of the disease is also mentioned.

It is described that the word ShleepadamasX be understood as an increase in the size of the foot. The word 'Shleepada' is derived from \" Silavath padam Shleepadam\" , where the limb/foot becomes hard like stone. Charaka and Sushruta have a similar view suggesting that the stony hard foot is the clear picture in manifested Shleepada. Vagbhata holds the similar opinion. The disease Shleepada that was described in classical Ayurvedic texts is now well recognized as Filariasis due to similarity in epidemiology and clinical features. Earliest reference of Shleepada (Filariasis) can be found in Charaka Samhita. In Caraka Samhita the symptoms and treatment were described in chapter Shotha. Sushruta has defined and classified the disease, vividly described the epidemiological aspects and prognosis also in the chapter Vriddhi and Upadamsa. Vagbhata holds the Susruta' s view but, defined the disease elaborately and specified the various stages of manifestations in the chapter of Granthi and Arbuda. Madhava has given an independent disease entity to Shleepada , whereas his predecessor Acharyas included the Shleepada under the disease Sotha. He described detailed note on epidemology, aetiopathogeneses, classification and prognosis of this condition and specified it is a kaphaja predominant disease though it is a Tridoshaja vyadhi. Roughness, blackish discolouration of affected part, hardness and pain are the symptoms of Vataja Shleepada. In Pittaja Shleepada patient suffers and incresed local temparature. Kaphaja Shleepada can be distinguished by oiliness', heaviness of affected part with knots and tumor like appearance. India is the largest Filariasis endemic country in the world. Now India contributes about 40% of total global burden of Filariasis and accounts for about 50% of the people at risk of infection. According to modem view Filariasis ( Shleepada ) is a vector bom parasitic is most common in India (98%). According to the estimates made in 1995 globally, there are nearly 1100 million people are at the risk of Filariasis and there are 120 million cases of Filariasis. According to another study in India the population exposed to of infection was 25 million in 1953 and 420 million in 1995.VOLUME-I Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of Shleepada'.

The disease is characterized by fleshy sprouts in anorectal region. Haemorrhoids are of two types, external and internal. The external haemorrhoids occurs outside the anal verge and are often painful when accompanied by swelling and irritation.The internal haemorrhoids occur inside the rectum and are usually not painful but may bleed when irritated. This condition is extremely common in adults and the incidence is same in both sexes. The aetiology of the disease is unknown but mostly they are associated with constipation, low fibre diet, increased intraabdominal pressure (prolonged straining), and sitting posture for long periods of time. The treatment is generally preventive, symptomatic and palliative in modem medicine. Surgery is the last resort. According to Ayurveda, the disease which causes pain like enemy and great discomfort by producing obstruction in the anal passage is called Arsha (haemorrhoids). Managing constipation and promotion of Agni, avoiding very hot and irritant food are the main principles of conservative treatment. In addition to the medical and surgical management certain parasurgical procedures namely Ksarakarma, Ksharasutra and Agnikarma are recommended and practiced in Ayurveda. Sushruta has described four fold methods for the treatments of Arsha, which are Bheshaja, Kshara, Agni and Shastra. Bheshaja i.e. Medical/conservative treatment includes various Ayurvedic medicines which are mild laxative, styptic, anti-inflammatory and decrease intra-abdominal pressure. Some lekhana Arsha. In certain other cases Ksarakarma and Ksharasutra are used effectively. Plain thread ligation of prolapsing internal hemorrhoids is also a popular method of treating the hemorrhoids on outpatient basis. Raktavasecana, Agnikarma and Shastrakarma are some other methods. Bheshaja (Medicine) treatment is the most suitable treatment in the small Arsha with history of mild/moderate bleeding. Bheshaja chikitsa can however be mixed with other techniques or therapeutic measures. It is safe and easily available method with good acceptability of patient.

It is defined as a state of excess adipose tissue mass and is generally assessed on the basis of body mass index. Obesity is more common among women.Globally the disease is prevalent in about more than 300 million adults worldwide (WHO World Health Report, 2003). In India obesity is increasing at an alarming rate with morbid obesity affecting about 5% of the Indian population.People having 'android obesity' (abdominal fat distribution) are at increased risk from those having 'gynoid obesity' (peripheral fat distribution around the body). Because of imbalance between energy intake and expenditure, the excess fat accumulates in the body. Although no satisfactory etiological classification of obesity is well defined but number of factors are known to be associated with its development. There are certain professions in which obesity is common. Familial tendency exists in many cases. Endocrine factors and energy imbalance are also responsible for the obesity. There are certain drugs which cause obesity like steroids, oral contraceptives, phenothiazine, insulin etc. As per Ayurvedic concept, the excess of fat accumulation in Medorogis causes pendulous movement of buttocks, belly etc. The obese person willsuffer the shortening of life span, difficulty in physical activity, difficult copulation, general weakness, bad odour of the body, excess of sweating, excessive appetite and thirst. Acharya Sushruta has advocated that the excessive intake of madhur dravya (sugar and carbohydrate) gets converted into sneha dravya s(lipids) leading to Medoroga. Apatarpana chikitsa is beneficial in the management of this disease. The uses of herbal and herbo-mineral preparations for the treatment of the obesity are mentioned in Ayurvedic classics. Out of them some Ayurvedic formulations were used in the present study. Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of Medoroga : Study 1: The effect of Commiphora wightii on serum cholesterol and serum lipids, was studied on 75 patients; 25 were kept as the control group, 25 received crude drug and 25 petroleum ether (PE) extract of Guggulu for three months.

The reduction was 24.2% in crude drug and 30.0 % in P.E.extract treated group. Study 2: In a series of 12 patients the total lipid was estimated in term of serum turbidity and coagulation time before and after one month of treatment with Commiphora wightii. The fall in total lipids was about 15.8% and rise in coagulation time was 63.8 per cent. Study 3: Considering the role of triglyceride in atherogenesis, in another series of twelve cases, triglyceride was estimated before and after treatment with Commiphora wightii. The fall in serum triglyceride was about 24%. Study 4:44 cases of hyperlipoproteinaemia were studied for a mean period of 12 weeks. 20 patients were treated with fraction 'A ' of P.E. extract {Guggulu), 12 with Clofibrate with to 24%, 24%, 4% and 14% fall respectively in the various fractions of lipids with Clofibrate, and 37%, 46, 21% and 30% fall in these fractions of lipids with Su- 13437-Ciba. Thus, fraction A ' had its effect on all lipid fractions which was found to be statistically significant (p<0.001). Further, no significant side effects with fractionA' (Guggulu) were observed during this study except mild diarrhoea (3 cases), hiccough (1 case) and restlessness (1 case). Study 5: 51 cases of hyperlipoproteinaemia after initial work up were followed on therapy for a period of 75 weeks. 41 cases were treated with fraction 'A ' and 10 cases with clofibrate in order to evaluate the long term clinical efficacy of fraction 'A'(Guggulu) and for its comparison with clofibrate. The effect on serum lipid profile, i.e. total cholesterol and triglycerides was evaluated. Initially, the lipid profile was reviewed at intervals of 4-5 weeks. Subsequently, the serum lipid analysis was repeated every 8-10 weeks for the long term follow up analysis. With fraction 'A ' (Guggulu) the reduction in serum cholesterol and triglycerides was found to be statistically significant (p<0.001) for the entire period of treatment, i.e. from 5th week onwards upto the conclusion of the study. Percentage fall in serum cholesterol ranged from 8.2%-36.8 % (mean 26.2%), in serum triglycerides, ranged from 8.4-50.2%(mean 36.5%). While during the course of treatment with clofibrate the reduction in serum cholesterol and triglycerides was also found to be statistically significant (p<0.001), i.e. the fall in serum cholesterol ranged from 8.9-43.5%, (meanVOLUME-I Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) 40 1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI reduction 31.3%) and serum triglycerides it ranged from 8.0-50.8%(mean reduction 33.3%). Study 6: An open interventional study was done with Combination of Vacha (Acorus Calamus) and Kutaki (Picrorhiza Kurro) in equal ratio in the dose of 1 gm TDS with Luke warm water. The study was done at eight centres viz. National Ayurveda Research Institute for Panchakarma, Cheruthuruthy, Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Eye Diseases, Lucknow, (RRAP) Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Cancer, Mumbai, Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Drug Development, Kolkata, Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Respiratory Disorders, Patiala, Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Gastro-Intestinal Disorders, Guwahati, Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Urinary Disorders, Jammu and at Dr. Achanta Lakshmipati Research Centre for Ayurveda, Chennai. In the study total 912 subjects were studied. Out of them 350 patients were dropped out and remaining 166 patients, 216 patients, 147 patients, 33 patients and patients got good response, fair response, poor response, no response respectively. Study 7: An open interventional study was done with Triphala sodhita Guggulul gm thrice a day. The study was done at three centres viz. (RRAP) Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Cancer, Mumbai, Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Respiratory Disorders, Patiala and at Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Urinary Disorders, Jammu. In the study total 170 cases were registered and out of them 30 patients were dropped out and others like 29 patients, 53 patients, 45 patients, 13 patients and patients got good response, fair response, poor response, no response and respectively. Study 8: An experimental study has been conducted on chicks. Prevention on cholesterol and fat induced hypercholesterolemia and hyperlilidemia was observed with the crude drugs as well as with the petroleum ether extract. In the subsequent experiment its effect on aortic atherosclerosis and coronary thrombosis was also extended and it was observed that Guggulu retarded the process of atherosclerosis to a great extent and prevented the process of thrombosis. Both the lesions were fully developed in the control group. Study 9: In order to find out the effect of Guggulu on endogenous hyperlipimia, its effect on neomercazole and estrogen induced hypercholesterolemia and hyperlipidemia was also studied.

This gave a lead that hypocholesterolemic and hypolipidemic action of this drug is mediated through the thyroid gland. Study 10: To evaluate Guggulu anti-obesity property, its effect on adipose tissue was studied. For this purpose C14 labelled triglyceride (radioactive) was administered to the control as well as to the treated group of rats receiving high fat diet. It was observed that the concentration of radio-active material in the adipose tissue of the treated group was much less than the control group. This showed that it prevented the deposition of fat in the adipose tissue, probably due to increasedlipolysis. Study 11: Three crystalline substances of Guggulu were isolated by means of successive extraction and column chromatography with different melting points. All of these gave positive test for triterpenoid. Molecular formula of one of them was calculated to be C21 H30 03. Its yield is about one mg. per gram of the crude drug. The effect of this principle was also tested on the serum lipids and thyroids. The response was similar as in case of petroleum ether extract. Another pure compound Z guggulsterone also increased the thyroid activity as evidenced by increase in the thyroid activity by increased iodine uptake and increase in proteolytic and peroxidase activity. Study 12: It was a prospective, multicentric, single arm study. The trial drugs were administered for 12 weeks with a follow up at the end of 14th week without any interventions. A total number of 146 individuals were enrolled in the study. The study was conducted at three peripheral institutes viz. Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Skin Diseases (RARISD),Vijayawada; National Ayurveda Research Institute for Panchakarma (NARIP), Cheruthuruthy. Central Ayurveda Research was administered orally in a dose of one gram (2 tablets of 500 mg each) thrice daily after food with lukewarm water and Haritaki Chuma (HC) (Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India, part-I, Volume-I) in a dose of 3 grams twice daily for twelve weeks. in one part each and Guggulu contain nine part in the formulation.The mean breathlessness score which was 38.7 \u00b1 29.4 before the treatment reduced to 19.5 \u00b117.7and 17.8 \u00b1 17.85 at the end of the treatment i.e.84th day and after follow up i.e. 98th day respectively.

This all basically happens due to alteration in GI motility, secretion and sensation.The symptomatic analysis Pravahika, Shokaja Atisara, Bhayaja Atisara etc. mentioned in Ayurveda classics which are characterized by altered bowel habits and other gastrointestinal symptoms. The pathogenesis of Grahani begins with the vitiation of Agni (digestive fire) in terms of its quality, quantity and function. All metabolic physiological transformations in the body are carried out under the influence of Agni. Mandagni (quantitative, qualitative and functional decrease of Agni) is the root cause of Ama Dosha and it is a crucial factor for manifestation of most of the diseases. Ama Dosha, resulting from mandagni, plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of gastro disorders enteric nervous system, alters the GI motility and hormone activity producing the symptoms of Grahani. All these diseases have psychological factors such as fear and anxiety as aetiology and IBS also has psychological factors responsible for its origin. The modem IBS therapies include bulk forming agents, anti- diarrhoeal, anti- spasmodic and anti - depressants etc which lack demonstrable efficacy. While considering the cost and potential risks (severe constipation, severe diarrhoea, ischemic colitis) against potential benefits, potential risks outweigh the possible benefits. Therefore, exploring alternative medicines for therapeutic options, which are effective, economical and safe, are needed. Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of grahani roga'. Study 1: An interventional open label study was done with Panchamrita Parpati Kalpa 500 mg thrice daily along with milk after food for 30 days. Study was done at Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Dmg Development, Gwalior. In this study total 86 cases were studied. Out of them, 10 got good response, 17 got fair response, 20 got poor response, while 7 had no response and 32 were dropped out.VOLUME-I 45 Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) VOLUME-I iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii Study 2: An interventional open label study was done with Bilwa Majja chuma 3 gm along with Takrarishta 25 ml thrice daily after meal for 30 days.Study was done at two centres viz. Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Drug Development, Gwalior and at Regional Ayurveda Research Institute, Gangtok. In this study total 220 cases were studied. Out of them 29 got good response, 77 got fair responses, 38 got poor response, while 8 had no response and 68 were dropped out. Study 3: A total of 171 patients were enrolled in the study entitled- ' Clinical Evaluation of Bilvadi Leha in the Management of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)' in which 22 patients dropped out in the course of the study. Among the total dropouts, 8 were not included for analysis. LOCF (Last observation carried forward) was applied on 14 patients who had completed at least 2 visits. Thus a data of 163 (171-22+14) patients was used for analysis. Effect of Bilvadi Leha on, disease specific symptoms, IBS severity score and WHO QOL- BREF Score was statistically significant (p-value<0.001). Chronic or recurrent abdominal discomfort was present in 90.8% of cases at baseline and after completion of treatment remained only in 26.4%. Likewise abdominal bloating was present in 89.6% cases at the baseline which was reduced to 42.3% at the end of 84th day. No significant adverse events or adverse reactions were observed during the study. Both, the Liver Function Tests (LFT) & Kidney Function Tests (KFT) tests were found to be in normal limits before and after the trial. (CTRIno. CTRI/2012/04/002577) Study 4: A total of 180 patients were enrolled in the study entitled ' Clinical Evaluation of Kutajarishta in the Management of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)' 10 patients had dropped out in the course of the study, LOCF (Last observation carried forward) was applied on 08 patients who had completed at least 2 visits. Thus a data of 178 (180-10+8) patients was used for analysis.The dropout patientswere not included in the study as they could not turn up for follow up in time due their prior engagement out of the city. One patient reported increased frequency of bowels and did not continue the study. Effect of Kutajarishta on chief complaints, disease specific symptoms, IBS severity Score and WHO QOL-BREF Score was highly significant ( P<.001 ), for example chronic or recurrent abdominal discomfort or pain was present in 99.4% of cases at baseline and after completion of treatment it was present in 24.7% of cases. Likewise urgency of bowel movements was present in 86.5% cases at the baseline which was reduced to 16.3% at the end of 84th day.

Brihat Gangadhara Chuma in a dose of 3 gm twice a day orally after intake of food with honey for 12 weeks. Total 90 subjects were enrolled out of which 85 completed and 05 dropped out from the study due to miss the follow up. 90 (100%) patients at baseline were complaining chronic or recurrent abdominal discomfort or pain but after 84th day treatment 81 (90%) and 14 days follow up 80 (88.9%) patients having no pain. 81 (90%) patients complaining of abdominal bloating but after 84a iday treatment 78 (86.7%) and follow up 76 (84.4%) patients having no such complains. 48 (53.3%) patients complaining of Constipation but after 84th day treatment and follow up both same i.e.87 (96.7%) patients having no such complains. 89 (98.9%) patients complaining of diarrhoea but after 84th day treatment 88 (97.8%) and follow up 89 (98.9%) patients having no such complains. At baseline 83 (92.2%) patients complaining of urgency of bowel movements but after 84th day treatment 79 (87.8%) patients and follow up 75(83.3%) patients having no such complains. 90 (100%) patients complaining feeling of incomplete evacuation but after 84th day treatment 41 (45.6%) patients and follow up 48 (53.3%) patients having no such complains and 90 (100%) patients complaining passage of mucus but after 84th day treatment 50 (55.6%) and follow up 49 (54.4%) patients having no such complains. The treatment has shown statistically significant effect on 84th day and follows up at the end of 14th week. IBS severity Score shows decrease trend of Mean and SD in all the 8 visits. Thus the \"t\" value always shows significant in compare to base line. Gradually that value increase to 24.113.The WHO QOL BREF also shows similar trend of highly significant result. No any adverse effect was noted during the study. CTRI/2016/01/006550 Conclusion: IBS is a condition that significantly affects the quality and productivity of life. Nidana parivarjana and synchronising the harmonious activity of Agni and Vata in the intestine are the key factors in managing IBS. From these studies it can be concluded that, in spite of the differences in gender, socioeconomic status, age group, Prakrti and geographic region; Ayurveda interventionproved to be very much safe, effective and tolerable in the management of IBS.VOLUME-I Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI IVOLUME-I Tab 2.8.1 Therapeutic Response at a glance in IBS Sl.No. Interventions Good responseFair Efficacy and safety profile of the patients in study 3 and 4 Parameters Bilvadi Leha Kutajarishta Baseline 84th day considered significant) Table 2.8.3: IBS Severity Score in study 5 IBS Severity ScorePaired Differences t-value df p-value MeanStd.

The disease Parinamasula mentioned in Ayurvedic literature can be taken as duodenal ulcer of contemporary science. The name Parinamasula indicates that the pain appears during the digestion of food. According to modem,peptic ulcers are open sores or erosions in the lining of either the duodenum (duodenal ulcers) or the stomach (gastric ulcers). Peptic ulcers are usually caused by either Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) bacteria or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). H Pylori bacteria are responsible for about four-fifths of all gastric ulcers and 95% of duodenal ulcers, while NSAIDs are known to cause about 20% of gastric ulcers and 5% of duodenal ulcers. Patients typically present with epigastric pain (from food in stomach for gastric ulcers and from a lack of food in duodenum for duodenal ulcers) as well as satiety and possibly nausea. Ayurveda offers a wide range of drugs for this condition and some such combinations are taken up for clinical evaluation in the present study series. The various aspects of the diseases etiopathogenesis, clinical featuresand management are discussed in details. Many drugs-herbal andherbomineral, and Sodhana-panchakarma, procedures have beenselected for investigations on more than 2000 patients in variousresearch institutes under Council. The effect of purificatory measures Sodhana has also been investigated by application of selected Panchakarma procedures. Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of Parinamasula: Study 1: Indukanta Ghrita and Mahatiktaka Ghrita: The Ghrita preparations are given before other purificatory measures are applied. They are also given as palliative ( Shamana ) therapy. The Indukantaand Mahatiktaka Ghrita are given in two separategroups of patients with another grouping as Shamana and a small courseof Sodhana. The studies in four groups of patients have been conducted onabout 1200 patient. The diagnosis and assessment of efficacy has beenmade on the basis of modem investigations including endoscopy. Itwas noted that both the Ghrita preparations are effective in 75 to 80%of patients. The efficacy is further enhanced if a course of Sodhana isgiven before administration of Ghrita. The effect of Mahatiktaka Ghrita was found relatively better.VOLUME-I Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) 50 1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI Study 2: Amashya sodhana: Induced Vamana or emesis has been recommended as an approach to treatment for such diseases. However, to make it more acceptable the procedure has been modified and stomach wash with decoction of herbal drugs- Varuna and Apamarga has been taken up. The radiologically positive patients of duodenal ulcer have been included. The stomach wash (Amasayasodhan) was given twice a week for 6 weeks.The patients were advised to come with empty stomach and the contents of stomach are aspirated through Ryle's tube. The decoction of drugs are introduced into stomach and withdrawn through the tube.The trial of this procedure has been conducted on 265 patients. The response has been encouraging since about 80% of patients shown relief. Study 3: The compound Nimbidin is isolated form Neem seed oil by process of extraction. The drug has been administered in endoscopically diagnosed patients of duodenal ulcer. The drug has been administered 1 in the form of 100 mg capsules thrice times a day.The overall effect of the drug has been good and 78.89% showedpositive response. Study 4: The have also shown good response in the management of duodenal ulcers. Study 5: An interventional open label study was done with Indukanta Ghrita 10 gms twice daily with milk for 60 days. Patients are advised to take warm water after the Ghritapana at every half an hour for 3 hours. The study was done at three centres viz. Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Urinary Disorders, Jammu, Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Skin disorders, Vijayawada and at Central ResearchUnit, Kottakal (presently merged with National Ayurveda Research Institute for Panchakarma, Cheruthuruthy). In this study total 97 cases were studied. Out of them, 42 got good response, 28 fair response, 7 poor response, while 1 had no response and 19 were dropped out.

It is characterized by the yellow appearance of the skin, sclera and mucous membranes resulting from an increased bilirubin concentration in the body fluids. It is clinically detectable when the plasma bilirubin exceeds 3 mg/dl. The disease has been categorized into hepatocellular (hepatic), haemolytic (prehepatic) and obstructive (posthepatic) types. Symptoms of Jaundice are extreme weakness, headache, fever, dull pain in the liver region, yellow discoloration of the eyes, tongue, skin and urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, itching all over the body.The infective hepatitis (viral) is one of the most common causes of jaundice. Viral hepatitis is the infection of the liver caused by hepatitis Jaundice viruses A, B, C, D, E, and G. Hepatitis A is highly infectious and is spread by the faecal-oral route. Hepatitis A is a less severe form of self limiting disease. According to WHO about 10-50 persons per 100,000 are affected annually by hepatitis A virus. Hepatitis B is usually transmitted by the parenteral route. Hepatitis B viral infection is a global problem; more than 2 billion people worldwide have evidence of past or current HBV infection and 350 million are chronic carriers of the virus. Although viruses are the main causes of liver diseases, the liver lesions arising from excessive drug therapy, environment pollution and alcoholic intoxication are not uncommon. Modem drugs have very little to offer for alleviation of hepatic ailments. Kamala (Jaundice) is mentioned as clinical entity in Ayurveda. According to Ayurveda, it is a pitta dominant disease caused by vitiation of pitta dosha due to excessive intake of pittavardhak substances. The therapy of this disease is also related to general treatment of Pandu though certain specific therapies for this disease have also been recommended in texts. Many single and compound herbal and herbomineral preparations are mentioned in Ayurvedic classical text books. Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of Kamala'.

Frequent passing of formed stools is not diarrhoea. It is usually a symptom of an infection in the intestinal tract, which can be caused by a variety of bacterial, viral and parasitic organisms. Infection is spread through contaminated food or drinking-water, or from person-to-person as a result of poor hygiene. In 2004, diarrhoeal disease was the third leading cause of death in low-income countries, causing 6.9% of deaths overall. In children under five years old, diarrhoeal disease is the second leading cause of death. According to Ayurveda, this disease is named as Atisara. The excessive use of heavy (hard to digest), too much dry, spicy, cold, and incompatible articles, irregular eating habits, indigestion, poisoning, fright, grief, impure water & food, change of season or physical contrarieties are contributing factors for causation of Atisara. Ayurveda has recommended different medicines for the treatment of Atisara and a coded formulation GVK compound was used in the present trial. Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of Atisara: Study 1: An open label interventional study was done with Coded drug GVK compound 2 cap (250mg each) thrice daily after food with butter milk. The study was done at Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Cardiovascular Diseases, New Delhi. In the study total 73 cases were studied. Out of them, 30 got good response, 24got fair response, 13 got poor response, while 4 had no response and 2 were dropped out. Conclusion: Ayurveda has shown promising results in the management of uncomplicated Diarrheoa and may be successfully used in its management.VOLUME-I Tab.2.11.

Sometimes, the track may have may have a single opening which is called as sinus. Generally, this track develops from ano-rectal abscess (Bhagandrapidika ) that burst spontaneously or is incised inadequately. An anal fistula may occur with or without symptoms. There may be intermittent swelling with pain, discomfort and discharge of pus in the perineal region. This track does not heal usually due to fecal contamination, presence of unhealthy granulation and lack or rest to the part. This is a purely surgical condition but surgery has lot of complications and recurrence rate is also quite high after surgery. According to Ayurveda, the disease condition in which there is tearing (cutting) pain in the area of bhaga, guda and basti is named as Bhagandara. Detailed description regarding its etiology, types, signs and symptoms including its many fold treatment is available in Ayurvedic literature. Ksharsutra treatment has been emphasized by Acharya Sushruta, the father of Indian Surgery in difficult cases and debilitated persons who are unfit for surgical treatment. Ksharsutra (medicated thread is an minimum invasive surgical Ayurvedic technique which was revived, developed and standardized in early seventies in Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi by Late Prof. P J. Deshpande. The Ksharsutra is prepared by smearing the cotton thread with several layer of fresh latex of plant Snuhi ( Euphorbia nerrifolia), Kshar powder (ashes Turmeric powder ( curcuma longa). The usage of Ksharsutra in the treatment of fistula has got advantage over the conventional surgery as it is an ambulatory procedure and no hospitalization is required. Patients can undergo treatment without paralyzing their routine work. Moreover, it can be used in patients who are otherwise not fit for surgery. Kshar Varti is also found to help in such cases. The Kshar varti are prepared from a standard mixture of snuhi ksheera, haridra chuma and ( haridra ) powder are added to the snuhi latex and the mixture is allowed to harden into a paste. When sufficiently thickened, the paste is rolled into small sticks (varti) of various lengths measuring from one to three inches each. The varti thus prepared are further dried to make them adequately stiff. When dried, the sticks are exposed to ultra-violet raysVOLUME-I Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I and sealed in the polyethylene pouches to be ready for clinical use. The present study was planned to evaluate the results of Ksharsutra and Kshar varti application. Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of Bhagandar : Study 1: About 700 patients, including 200 patients of recurrent fistulae after operation have been studied by Clinical Research Enquiry at IMS, BHU, and Varanasi with Ksara sutra therapy. Out of 700 patients691 (98.7%) have been completely cured. Study 2: Kshar sutra study on 395 patients has been conducted in the Council's Research Institutes and the outcome has been very promising, 386 (97.72%) patients responded with good improvement. Study 3: Open label interventional study with Ksharsutra applied depending upon the severity and depth of fistula. The study was done at three centres viz. Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Cardiovascular Diseases, New Delhi, Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Drug Development, Kolkata and at (RRAP) Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Cancer, Mumbai. In the study total 729 cases were studied. Out of them, 544 patients, 124 patients, 24 patients, 6 patients got good response, fair response, poor response, no response respectively and 31 patients were dropped out. Study 4: Open label interventional study with Kshar Varti, applied for 7 times at the interval of every two days. The study was done in two centres viz. (RRAP) Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Cancer, Mumbai and at Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Cardiovascular Diseases, New Delhi. In the study total 69 cases were studied. Out of them, 18 patients, 22 patients, 16 patients, 9 patients got good response, fair response, poor response, no response and 4 patients were dropped out. Conclusion: This technique has been very well accepted/adopted by the practitioners of Ayurveda. The efficacy of this approach has also been proved by studies conducted by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). This therapy is very effective in the management of Bhagandara. The Ksara-Sutra being an OPD procedure does not requireanaesthesia, heavy medication and hospitalization. After application ofKshara-sutra, patients can perform their routine duties.

It is characterized by erythematous sharply demarcated papules and rounded plaques covered by silvery micaceous scale. In Psoriasis, main abnormality is of increased epidermal proliferation due to excessive multiplication of cells in the basal layers. There are five types of Psoriasis -Plaque, Guttate, Inverse, Pustular and Erythrodermic. The most common type is Plaque psoriasis in which red and white hues of scaly patches appears on the topmost layer of the epidermis which gives it a silvery white appearance. Psoriasis causes skin redness and irritation. People of any age can be affected by psoriasis, but mostly the disease begins between 15 and 35 years of age. Globally about 1% of the world's population is affected by Psoriasis. The etiology of Psoriasis is unknown. The disease has genetic predisposition .The precipitating factors like trauma, infections, stress and medications (lithium, beta blockers & antimalarials) may cause flare of the disease. The current modem therapy includes topical use of agents such as coal tar, salicylic acid and anthralin which are now largely replaced by topical glucocorticoids, calcipotriene and a retinoid (tazrotene).Ultraviolet radiation is also used as local measure to manage psoriasis. These drugs give temporary symptomatic relief and often produce toxic side effect. As per Ayurvedic concept, Kitibha is classified under Kshudra Kushtha. In Ayurveda the causative factors of skin disease are elaborately classified. Continued practice of Apathya Ahara Acharaya Sushruta has clearly indicated the genetic origin of the disease. In Kitibha, vatakaphadosha are predominantly involved. Kitibha may be co-related with Psoriasis of modem medical diagnosis. The line of treatment for Kitibha is advocated in accordance with the general treatment of kushtharoga. The main treatment is Sodhana followed by Samana and Rasayana therapy. Many single and compound herbal and herbomineral preparations are mentioned in Ayurvedic classical text books. In the present study different Ayurvedic procedures and medicines were used for clinical evaluation.VOLUME-I Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) 62 1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of Kitibha\".

Malaria is a protozoal disease caused by infection with parasites of the genus plasmodium and transmitted to man by certain species of infected female Anophelese mosquito. The incidence of malaria worldwide is estimated to be 300-500 million clinical cases each year & Malaria is estimated to kill between 1.1 and 2.7 million people worldwide each year. It is mostly caused by Plasmodium falciparaum. In India, during 2003 about 1.65 million cases were reported with 943 deaths and there were 0.7 million cases of P. falciparum malaria. In Ayurvedic literature Malaria fever is known as Vishama jvara (Intermittent fever). The disease was well known to Ayurvedic physicians as Vishama jvara from ancient times. Ayurvedic literature contains many drugs prescribed for the treatment of Vishamajawara. In the present study different combinations of Ayurvedic medicines were taken up for assessment of clinical efficacy. Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of Vishama Jvara: Study 1: An open label interventional study was done with Sphatika Bhasma 500 mg thrice a day, Guduchi thrice a day and Ayush-64 lgm thrice a day for seven days.

Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent psychiatric conditions in the world. Generalized anxiety disorder is defined as excessive anxiety and worry about several events or activities for a majority of days during at least six month period. The worry is difficult to control and is associated with symptoms such as muscle tension, impaired concentration, autonomic arousal, restlessness and insomnia etc.The anxiety is subjectively distressing and produces impairment in important areas of a person's life. A person's genetics, biochemistry, environment and psychological profile may contribute to the development of anxiety disorders. The prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder is about 5-6%. As per Ayurvedic concept Manodvega (Anxiety neurosis) is one of the Manasika Vikara. Manodvega may be defined as a Manas (mind) + Udvega (anxiety) = Manoodvega (Anxious status of mind). Mind is a dual faculty Ubhayendriya ) or sensory-motor faculty ( Jnana- Karmendriya ), it perceives and responds. The physical well being as well as illness is reflected in mind. The influence of mind cannot be ruled out in origin, existence or cure of any disease. When allowed to persist for long time the psychic and somatic disorders get combined with each other. In Manodvega, when the mind is afflicted with anxiety, fear, agitation etc. this leads to worry, apprehension, depression, psychological arousal as anger, irritability and ultimately lead to disturbance in personal, familial and social harmony. The Ayurvedic principle of synthesis of mind, body and soul to consider man as integrated entity, helps to treat mental disorders effectively. Medhya rasayanas and Satvavajaya chikitsa are such measures, which can be utilized for the treatment of Manodvega. Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of Manodvega\".

Seizures are episodes of disturbed brain function that cause changes in attention or behavior. It is a chronic neurological condition caused by abnormal cerebral nerve cell activity. More than 2 million people in the United States and over 50 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy. The incidence of epilepsy is between 0.3 - 0.5 percent in different population throughout the world and the prevalence of epilepsy is roughly in the range 5-10 persons per 1000. On the basis of the etiology, epilepsy is divided into two categories idiopathic and acquired. In idiopathic epilepsy no specific cause is found but patients with idiopathic epilepsy sometimes have a genetic predisposition. Head injury, cerebral vascular disease, various allergic reactions cerebral degenerative and demyelinating diseases, toxic and metabolic disorders are important causes of seizures. There is a great variation in symptoms from brief lapses of awareness, simple localized focal jerks, turning of head and eyes, change in posture, vocalization, hallucinations to loss of consciousness and violent convulsions depending upon the specific type of seizure. The chief division of seizure types is between partial (focal) seizures in which paroxysm neuronal activity is limited to one part of the cerebrum and generalized seizures where the electrophysiological abnormality involves large areas of both hemispheres simultaneously and synchronously. It is manifested by a variety of clinical symptomatology. The treatment of epilepsy is based on medical therapy (use of anti-epileptic drugs) and sociologic management. Surgical therapy in cases where the patients with potentially remediable lesions such as brain tumour or any space occupying lesions are resorted to if needed. According to Ayurveda, loss of smriti (consciousness) has been ascribed to be the cardinal feature of the disease Apasmara Smaraor smriti means memory, which indicate, intelligence and consciousness and Ap means loss. The nidana (causative factors) of apasmara are sharirika (physical) like and krodha , bhaya etc. and agantuka hetus are like poison, injury etc. Signs and symptoms of Apasmara mentioned in Ayurveda are cardiac pain, visual hallucination, falling down, twitching of tongue and eyes, frothing salivation, tremors of hands and feet.VOLUME-I Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) 74 1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of Apasmara: Study 1: An open label interventional study was done with Vachadiyoga Ghana Satwa tablet 500 mg. thrice a day for 6 months.

According to Ayurveda, schizophrenia is compared with unmada. Lack of mental discipline, indulgence in negative thoughts and activities, negative emotions like hatred, anger cause imbalance in satva, raja and tama which then leads to this condition. It is also believed that the vitiated doshas evade the brains of the persons with less satva or whose mind is under rajsik and tamsik influences. These doshas then block the channels of mind or manovahisrotas and nerve impulses. As a result, the functioning of mind and intelligence get affected. Due to this the patient fails to differentiate between real and virtual, correct and incorrect. Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of Unmada'. Study 1: Double blind clinical trial was done jatamansi DC.). The study was done on 108 patients divided into 4 groups. The affect of trial drugs Brahmyadi yoga and Tagara were compared with the placebo and known anti-psychotic drug chlorpromazine. The results were evaluated on the basis of clinical symptoms, psychological assessment and multiphasic questionnaire. The data were statistically analyzed and it was concluded that the Brahmyadi yoga has statistically significant effect in comparison to placebo and Tagara. The effect was also comparable to chlorpromazine. The study shows Brahmyadiyoga was more effective than the placebo. Chlorpromazine was found significantly better than both brahmyadi yoga and placebo. Study 2:A double blind controlled study was also carried out on 65 patients of chronic schizophrenia to study the efficacy of Brahmyadiyoga.

In this study also the study drug was found to be effective as compared to the placebo but chlorpromazine was more efficacious than both the groups. Conclusion: Brahmyadiyoga is free from toxicity or side effects, however, on long term use blood pressure and liver function should be assessed.

It is characterized by chronic airway inflammation and increased airway responsiveness resulting in symptoms of wheeze, cough, chest tightness and dyspnoea. It is also functionally characterized by the airflow limitations usually reverses spontaneously or with treatment. The available treatment in modem medical science like bronchodilators, steroids even in the form of inhalers and leukotrienes modifiers have made tremendous success in providing instant or symptomatic relief in Bronchial asthma. But there is recurrent acute exacerbation and remissions and treatment has many side effects like nausea, vomiting, tremor, huskiness of voice, disturbance of hypothalamus - pituitary -adrenal axis. Chronic bronchitis is a well-defined clinical condition in contemporary medical science classified under the broader heading of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) that is a progressive preventable condition, without cure. In modem medicine; antibiotics, anti- histaminic, bronchodilators, expectorants etc., are commonly used for the management of chronic bronchitis. Although, they are effective in reducing the severity of the disease and suppressing the symptoms; none of these modalities of treatment provide a permanent cure and have limitations owing to their unwanted effects. In Ayurveda, the concept, etio-pathogenesis and treatment of Shwas and Tamaka Shwasa have been described in detail. The clinical manifestations of Shwasa described in Ayurveda classics have a striking similarity to the clinical manifestation of Bronchial asthma respectively. Many single and compound herbal and herbo-mineral preparations are mentioned in Ayurveda classical text books. Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of Shwas and Tamak Shwas: Study 1: The Godanti Bhasma) have been evolved and put on trial in separate groups of patients.

The data has been statistically analyzed.Out of 783 patients studied with Shwasa Kesari, most of the patients showed good response. Only less than 5% showed poor effect onthe disease. Laksmi Vilasa Rasa, Godanti combination was equally effective and about 8% did not show any effect of the therapy. Study 2: Kantakari, whole plant was studied on 151 patients. The drugwas administered in the form of Kwatha (Decoction) in the dose of 30ml. three times a day. The effect of the drug was evident in most of thepatients (59.09%) who completed full course of 4 weeks. Study 3: An open label interventional study was done with 6 weeks.

Optical measures such as use of spectacles. Contact lens and low vision aids have a great role in improving the visual acuity of myopias to a great extent. But, myopias are more prone to injuries and occasionally eyeball may be injured due to shattering of glasses. In some cases use of contact lens causes comeal irritation leading to opacities of cornea. Surgical methods such as radial keratotomy, scleral resection, filtering operation, etc. have been found to be ineffective and none of these has been safe. Owing to all the above adverse effects of different optical and surgical measures, it is at this juncture that the need for drugs/measures that could effectively tackle the myopia without any adverse effects. Ayurveda has identified three important factors being responsible for the causation of all types of disease, which include ophthalmic problems too, viz. Incompatible contact of sense organs (eyes) with their respective sensation ( asatmye indriyartha samyoga ), Misuse of intellect (Prajnaparadha) and Abnormal cycles of sensons (rituviparyaya). To overcome these three factors ancient medical scholar prescribed specific diet (ahara), drugs ( ausadha ) and practices ( vihara ). Out of these three, vihara or practices play a central role in the prevention and cure of eye diseases. Practices advised for the protection of the eyes such as padabhyanga (massage of feet), sitalodaka upacara (cold water applications) are mentioned in various texts of Ayurveda. Solar therapy ( suryopasana ) is found in Netropanisad resembles therapeutic principles of yoga and naturopathy. It is seen that the contemporary yoga movement supplanted its philosophical values and got shrouded with art of physical culture. This phase is characterized by rapid movement of hathayoga, which includes adaptation of yogasanas and pranayama procedures to protect the eyes from different affections. In the present time's new eye diseases have become a major threat to the mankind and hence significance of multidisciplinary approach becomes mandatory. Integration of concepts of Ayurvedic Opthalmology, principles of yoga and naturopathy and practices of eye exercises may turn a new leaf in tackling eye problems. Description concerning aetiopathogenesis, clinical features and the line of management of different ametropic conditions (refractive errors) including myopia is found in AyurvedicVOLUME-I Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) 86 1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI texts. Sushruta Samhita -the most authentic work on Ayurvedic ophthalmology of tunics of the eye ( drishtigata patalas), which are comparable to refractive media of the eye viz., cornea, uveatract, lens, vitreous and the photo sensitive layer, the retina. Clinical features of afflictions of the first three patalas broadly reflect the concept of refraction and errors of refraction. Identical comparable condition of myopia is found as one of the clinical feature of timira of third patala (medo ashrita patala), where reduced visual acuity for distance is the striking feature ascribed to the affection of doshas in the upper part of the tunic. By considering the above description it can be concluded that the afflictions of I, II, III patalas may be comparable to errors of refraction. In affections of III patals, when doshas invade the upper part of the tunic patient feels difficulty in observing distant objects. This particular stage may be considered as myopia. Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of Timira'. Study 1: A comparative evaluations of the Mahatriphla Ghrita and SaptamriLahua has been conducted on patients of myopia. The effect of treatment was assessed on the basis of changes in the vision observed through Snellen's chart. It was observed that both the treatments have been reasonably well effective in the improvement of vision. However, the effect of Mahatriphala Ghrita was more pronounced. Study 2: Clinical study was conducted on 264 patients of Myopia preferably children and young adults without suffering from anyother eye diseases. An Ayurvedic regimen consisting of internal and local treatment was given for 2 to 6 months to the patients. Saptamrita lauha 500 mg.thrice a day with milk was given orally. A regular eye wash once aday with Triphala jala was prescribed to the patients. The patients were also subjected to instillation of with juice mixed honey once aday and Netra bindu application twice a day.The patients with slight vision defects showed better response to treatment. Best results were obtained in the patients with 1.00 diapters deficiency of vision. A long term two months or 6 months duration of treatment showed better result. Out of 264 patients, 41 patients showed three line improvements, 50 patients showed two line improvement and 80 patients showed one line improvement. No response was observed in 93 patients. Study 3: An open label interventional study was done with Saptamrita Lauh 500 mg twice daily along with honey/milk after food for 3 months.

Out of them, 53 got good response, 109 fair response, 132 poor response, while 72 had no response and 36 were dropped out. Study 4: An open label interventional study was done with Saptamrita Lauh 500 mg. twice daily along with honey/milk after food, Netra Bindu (eye drops) instillation twice a day and Akshi Tarpana with Triphala kwath for 3 months. Study was done at Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Cardiovascular Diseases, New Delhi. In this study comprising of interventions like Netrabindu, Saptamrita Lauh + Akshi Tarpana with Triphala kwatha and conducted at 1 center. Total 26 cases were studied. Out of them 4 got good response, 11 got fair responses, 8 got poor response, while 3 had no response. Conclusion: These regimens may be effective by increasing the nutritionof the lens, helping better accommodation and cleanse themicrochannels. Though there is no complete cure of the condition but Ayurveda has shown promising results in controlling the extent of Myopia and improvement was also found to a good extend. Myopia is a important condition with increasing prevalence and with this Ayurveda regimen we can certainly control this condition.VOLUME-I Tab 2.19.

It has been discussed elaborately in ancient Ayurvedic texts. Susruta, the father of surgery was of the view that the dietary factors are much more responsible for the calculus formation the urinary tract (Mutrasmari). A drug which can correct crystalloid colloid imbalance and relieves the binding mucin of calculi, antiseptic, antispasmodic and diuretic, can relax the muscles of urinary bladder and prevent the supersaturation of crystalloids and possessing anti inflammatory properties on renal tissue may have a possible role in the management of urolithiasis. The Council, since its inception has been engaged in finding out effective, inexpensive, non invasive and safe treatment modalities. Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of Mutrasmari: Study 1: The effect of Ayruvedic drugs Sveta Parpatti with Pasanabheda and Goksuru in the management of Mutrasmari (Urolithiasis) was conducted. Under this study 30 radiologically established cases of renal and ureteric calculi were included. One gm of Sveta parpati with 50 ml of Pasanabheda-goksuru kwatha was given thrice daily. The assessment of the response of the therapy was made on the basis of relief in presenting symptoms and the radiological findings. The study shows complete cure in maximum patients. The radiological findingsalso support the elimination of stone/reduction of their size. Study 2: The effect of Palasa ksara in the management of Mutrasmari (Urolithiasis) was studied on 50 radiologically established cases.Out of total 50 cases, 24 were having renal calculus (Vrkkasmari ) and 26 were having ureteric calculus (Gavini asmari). Palasa Asarawas given in the dose of 1 gm. thrice daily with water for 30 days.Observations of the results of the treatment were made on the basisof clinical improvement and radiological findings before and afterthe treatment. The study has shown that urolithiasis could be well managed with Ayurvedic therapies. The radiological findings also support the elimination of stone/reduction of their size.

The five types of heart disease have been classified on thebasis of Dosa. These descriptions and practices by physicians could be useful for management of present day challenges posed by the heartdiseases. Many studies have been conducted by premier Institutions of Ayurveda and Modem medicine and allied disciplines. Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of Hrid Roga: Study 1: A preliminary study was conducted on 40 patients for a period ofthree months to evaluate changes in all the fractions of lipid. Thecrude drug ( Guggulu) was administered 12- 16 gm. per day in divided dosesin the patients suffering from lipid disorders obesity, coronary heart disease, hemiplegia etc. A progressive fall was recorded in all thecomponents of lipids. At the end of three months, the percentageof average fall was serum addition to this fall in the serum lipids, reduction in body weight was alsorecorded which was approximately 1 kg per patient per month. Simultaneously, the clinical relief in the symptoms of hemiplegia and coronary heart diseases was also observed. One of the significant findings has been that some of the cases in whom Twave was inverted or S-T segment was depressed got corrected after three months treatment. Study 2: A further controlled clinical trial on 135 patients of Ischaemic Heart Disease. The trial of 3 months course of Guggulu in two groups ofpatients; 25 patients as the control group and 110 patients trial group, showed very good effect of drug in the patients of coronary insufficiency. The precordial pain and dyspnoea on effort, cardinal features of the disease were relieved completely in about 70% ofthe patients in the treated group and substantially reduced in the remaining patients.

Essential hypertension usually remains silent and is diagnosed accidentally in a routine clinical examination or after the target organ involvement, and hence considered a major risk factor to human health. With every rise of 20 mmHg in Systolic BP and lOmmHg in Diastolic BP, there is an increased risk for the target organ injury and cardio-vascular damage. Elevated blood pressure is one of the major risks for micro and macro vascular injury which results in increased risks of heart attack, heart failure, stroke and kidney diseases. The direct description of hypertension is not found anywhere in the available Ayurvedic classical texts, because its diagnosis is based on the measurement of blood pressure by sphygmomanometer. So in Ayurveda the disease hypertension can be understood on the basis of etiopathology, symptomatology and complications (about which plenty of literature is available). Vyanabala Vaishmya or Hypertension is not described as such in classical Ayurvedic literature. Some Ayurvedic scholars call it Raktagata-Vata. According to a WHO Expert Committee on Hypertension control met in Geneva (1994), it is the commonest cardiovascular disorders, posing major public health challenge to society. Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of Hypertension: Study 1: The Council has taken up clinical investigations on a large sample with following drug formulations viz. Ushiradi chuma 3-6 gm twice daily for six weeks and Tagaradi chuma 3-6 gm twice daily for six weeks. The study has been conducted on 964 patients in two groups. The observations indicate control in most of the patients (above 65-75%) in both groups. Study 2: Clinical study was conducted to evaluate efficacy and safety of Ashvagandhadyarishta, Jatamamsi Arka and Sa.rpagand.ha Vati in 10 ml BD and lgm BD respectively for a period of 12 weeks at three peripheral institutes viz. Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Cardiovascular Diseases, New Delhi; Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Infectious Diseases, Patna and at Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Nutritional Disorders, Mandi.

The patients of essential hypertension with systolic Blood Pressure between 140-159 mm Hg. and Diastolic B.P. between 90 and 99 mm Hg. of either sex aged >18 years were selected for the study as per inclusion criteria. The patients were assessed on the basis of changes in systolic and diastolic BP, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) and SF-36 Health Survey Score for quality of life (Q.O.L.) Mean systolic BP before treatment was 149.09+ 5.28mm of Hg and after treatment it was 125.16 + 10.04 mm of Hg. Mean diastolic BP before treatment was 94.16 mm of Hg and after treatment it was 80.46 mm of Hg. The initial mean of HARS was 13.54 and after treatment it was 7.26.The change was found to be statistically significant. The quality of life was assessed by SF-36 Health Survey Questionnaire which revealed statistically significant improvement (p<0.001) in Physical Functioning, Energy / Fatigue, Emotional well being, Social Functioning and General Health. During the study no adverse effect was noticed. (The study was registered under CTRI vide no. CTRI/2012/03/002525) Study 3: An open label clinical study was done at two centres viz. Regional Ayurveda Research Institute, Itanagar and at M.S. Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Endocrine Disorders, Jaipur. Total 99 patients were enrolled. Rudraksha Chuma (API -Part 1 Vol. 4 Page 104-105) was given in a dose of 2 gm twice daily with water for 12 weeks. Significant improvement was seen in clinical symptoms of Hypertension of Headache, Anxiety, Dizziness, Tinnitus, Confusion, Fatigue, Shortness of Breath, Nausea, Increased Sweating, Abnormal Sleep and Palpitation. Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale Score also showed significant improvement. Blood pressure showed mild improvement only. There was no adverse effect during the study.

Vatarakta viz-a-viz gout is a common condition in both primary care and specialist practice.Although not life-threatening, it has a significant impact on quality of life. Vatarakta viz-a-viz gout is a very painful condition and it curtails the output or day-to-day work of the patient. It is the commonest crystal arthropathy occurring in men over 40 years of age, presenting usually in the form of \" podagra \" (acute onset of pain, erythema and swelling of the first metatarsophalangeal joint). It has been called as \" the disease o f kings\" due to its association with rich foods and alcohol consumption. Gout is a crystal-deposition disease that results from chronic elevation of uric acid levels above the saturation point for monosodium urate monohydrate (MSUM) crystal formationand it is associated with intense pain and enhanced vascular permeability evidenced by oedema and erythema that may extend beyond the joint margin.The fundamental bio\u00ad chemical hallmark of gout is hyperuricaemia and can result from increased production or decreased excretion of uric acid or from a combination of the two processes. Uric acid is the end product of metabolism of purines. Elaborate descriptions of Vatarakta (gout) in traditional Indian medicine show that it was one of the main articular diseases in the past itself. Descriptions of several disorders having symptom of pain, inflammation and burning sensation in the joints have been referred to in Vedic literature. Sedentary lifestyle is one of the main etiological factors of Vatarakta. Many people, due to their non-manual work practices, are having sedentary life style. When aggravated Vata is obstructed by aggravated Rakta, thus obstructed Vata again vitiates the Rakta. This pathological state is known as Vatarakta or Vatasonitam. The chief complaint of the patient is severe Sandhi-shula (joint pain) onset on Hasta (hand), P ada mulagata sandhi (MTP joints) and then migrates to other Sandhi (joint) in a way similar to Ak-huvisa (rat poison). It produces various signs and symptoms like Ruka (excruciating pain), Swayathu (swelling), Daha (burning sensation), Stabdha (stiffness joint), (blackish (hyperesthesia) etc. Ayurvedic scholars have correlated Vatrakta with Gout on the basis of its various aetiological factors and clinical manifestations. The mainstay of treatment during the acute attack is the administration of anti inflammatory drugs such as colchicines; non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or glucocorticoids depending on the age of the patient and co morbid conditions. The colchicines and NSAIDs may be quite toxic in theVOLUME-I Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) 100 1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI elderly particularly in the presence of renal insufficiency and gastrointestinal disorders. Therefore, there is a definite need to explore more efficacious and radical cure to this illness. Ayurveda in its herbarium has lots of herbo-mineral compounds which can fill up this gap. Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of Vatarakta: Study 1: A total 100 subjects (25-65 years) of primary gouty arthritis fulfilling the diagnostic criteria as recommended by the American College of Rheumatology were selected for the present study from OPD of two peripheral centres ofCentral Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences irrespective of their sex, religion and socio-economic status. Only those subjects were selected for clinical trial, who presented themselves with at least 6 of 12 criteria's of American College of Rheumatology (1977). Amrita Guggulu was given lOOOm g twice daily orally and Pinda Taila was applied locally 10 ml twice daily. The trial therapy was assessed on the basis of improvement in clinical features, VAS score, patient's global assessment scale score, physician's global assessment scale score, SF-36 Health Survey Score for quality of life (Q.O.L.) and biochemical parameters. Each patient was subjected for routine blood test, serum uric acid, liver function tests and renal function tests before treatment and after 84th day of treatment. The trial combination showed statistically significant improvement in the clinical manifestations, quality of life as well as reduction in marker of hyperuricemia i.e. serum uric acid; the mean serum uric acid at the baseline was 7.76 mg/dl which was reduced to 6.50 mg/dl after the trial period of 84 days. There was also decrease in the level of VAS score, patient's global assessment scale score and physician's global assessment scale score. There were no impairment in liver function test and renal function test, indicating the good safety profile of trial therapy.(CTRI/2014/08/004929). Conclusion: The study suggests very promising results of Ayurveda intervention in the management of Vatarakta (gout), and it can be successfully used in the management of Gouty arthritis.VOLUME-I Table 2.23: Effect of the trial drugs on Outcome measures of study 1 Parameters (n = 100) Baseline Mean (\u00b1 SD)84th day VAS) (1.78) 1.51 (1.78) 17.84 <0.001 Quality of Life (SF-36 (21.39) 84.15 (15.14) 12.27 <0.001 101 - (50 Glorious years) VOLUME-I iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii Role to physical 25.00 <0.001 Figure 2.23: Effect of trial drug on safety parameters in study 1 4 JS aa44.113 37.087 1.022 1.0240.588 Baseline Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) 1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI 2.24: KASTARTAVA (DYSMENORRHOEA) BACKGROUND: Dysmenorrhoea is a medical condition of pain during menstruation but more realistic definition includes cases of sufficient magnitude so as to incapitate daily activities. A pain which is of uterine origin and directly linked to menstruation but with no visible pelvic pathology is called Primary dysmenorrhoea. Pain reaches a maximum between ages of 18 and 24 years and thereafter diminishes. The pain is mainly felt in hypogastrium and is often referred to inner and front aspects of the thighs. During a severe attack the patient looks drawn and pale and may sweat; nausea and vomiting are common; there may be diarrhoea and rectal and bladder tenesmus. As per Ayurvedic classics, pain occurred in any part of the body due to aggravation of Vata dosha and the main two reasons for it are obstruction in the passage ( Margavarodha ) or loss of body tissues ( Maharshi Charaka, in Udavartini yonivyapad, menstrual blood is pushed in upward direction by the aggravated Apana vayu (the governing force of menstrual force) due to obstruction in its normal flow in Pakwashaya (pericolon and pelvic region). On the basis of the symptom 'immediate relief of pain following discharge of menstrual blood' mentioned by Charaka, it appears to be the nearer to primary or spasmodic dysmenorrhoea. Population surveys suggest a wide variation in prevalence rate of dysmenorrhoea from studies around the world including India reporting a range between 28% and 71.7%. It is reported in a study that Dysmenorrhoea is a common problem in India (79.67%) and most of them (37%) suffered regularly from dysmenorrhoea severity. In conventional system, drug therapy includes Prostaglandin Synthetase Inhibitors for pain management. However, their use is contraindicated in women with GI ulcers, bronchial asthma. Side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, constipation, heart bum and dizziness. Other drugs include hormone therapy and calcium channel blockers. To regulate uterine contractions and uterine tone, many effective Ayurvedic regimens are described in Ayurvedic classics and various studies have also been conducted; but a proper statistical analysis and interpretation are not available.VOLUME-I Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of kastartava : Study 1: A multi-centric prospective observational study was done between March, 2011 and August, 2012 from 09 participating centres viz.

Total of 368 patients were enrolled in the study.Changes in the intensity of menstrual pain assessed by Visual Analogue Score (VAS) and Quality of life assessed by SF-36 (RAND) Health survey questionnaire. The base line characteristics of demographic information: the average age of the subjects was 22.0 \u00b1 (5.40) years (range 21- 25 years), majority of subjects (62.1%) were students, 82.7 % were having education up to 10th or above. The menstrual pattern (amount and duration of menstrual flow and interval of cycle) was normal in all the subjects. 54.3% (n=159) subjects were having the family history of dysmenorrhoea. Majority of subjects 56.3% (n=202) were having Pittaj-kaphaja Prakriti.The findings of this study shows that the score received on the various domains of SF-36 scales were improved at the end of 90th day and effect seen were also significant (p<0.001).The subjects also got relief on the associated symptoms like nausea, vomiting, constipation, giddiness, breast tenderness, diarrhea, headache and fainting.

The syndrome affects around 4 to 9% of women of reproductive age. Insulin resistance (IR) accompanied by compensatory hyperinsulinemia constitutes another major biochemical feature of PCOS, which leads to early luteinizing hormone (LH) sensitivity of the follicle and to stimulation of both ovarian and adrenal androgen production. Oligo-anovulation due to ovarian dysfunction continues to be the pivotal feature that makes this syndrome the major cause of anovulatory infertility in developed countries. The European Society for Human Reproduction and the American Society of Reproductive Medicine or Rotterdam criteria 2003 are the agreed international di agnostic criteria for PCOS. concentrations), of 35 days or longer), or amenorrhea (no menses in the last 6 months) after negative screening pregnancy test and/or polycystic ovary are the three main diagnostic criteria, and two out of these three confirm the diagnosis, with exclusion of other androgen excess etiologies. Polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility affecting 90 to 95% of women, attending infertility clinics. Hirsutism and hyperandrogenism in PCOS occur in 60% of women and result from increased synthesis and release of ovarian androgens. Due to the high prevalence of IR, PCOS shares components of metabolic syndrome: Abdominal obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, gestational and type II diabetes, abnormalities in lipid profile, hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, and probably cardiovascular disease. Women with PCOS also have an increased risk of endometrial carcinoma because of longstanding unopposed estrogen stimulation. The features of PCOS may be correlated with \" PuspaghneeJataharin.ee \" described in Ayurvedic classics (may be correlated with hirsutism/ hyperandrogenism). 12 But there is no treatment principle/ treatment available in the said classic.

Pathological changes in the late stage of OA include softening, ulceration and focal disintegration of the articular cartilage; synovial inflammation also may occur. Typical clinical symptoms are pain, particularly after prolonged activity and weight bearing; whereas stiffness is experienced after inactivity. It is also known as degenerative arthritis, which commonly affects the hands, feet, spine, and large weight-bearing joints, such as the hips and knees. It can present as localized, generalized or as erosive osteoarthritis. Most cases of osteoarthritis have no known cause and are referred to as primary osteoarthritis. Primary osteoarthritis is mostly related to aging. Secondary osteoarthritis is caused by another disease or condition. Epidemiological profile of this disease in India is not clear but it is estimated that osteoarthritis (OA) is the second most common rheumatologically problem and is most frequent joint disease with prevalence of 22%-39% in India. Eleven COPCORD (Community Oriented Program for Control of Rheumatic Disorders) reports show knee OA data: there were 3328 knee OA patients out of a total surveyed pooled sample of 41,884. The pooled prevalence of knee OA thus becomes eight percentages. Knee Osteoarthritis prevalence increases with age, so that about 11% of all women over the age of 60 years have symptoms due to knee OA. The guidelines for treatment of the OA of the knee from the National institute of health and clinical excellence (NICE), the American college of rheumatology and the European league against rheumatism recommend non-drug treatments including the education of the patients, social support, physical exercises and weight loss . Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are still used as the initial treatment in primary care as anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins. NSAIDs are associated with a number of side effects, most importantly the increased risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and renal failure as well as increasing risk of myocardial infarction and stroke especially in the COX-2 inhibitor category. The intra-articular injections of corticosteroid and sodium hyaluronate etc. are also in practice but have limited role. Finally end stage forms of OA areVOLUME-I 107 Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I treated with knee replacement therapy. This is frequently associated with pain relief but however hold a substantial post-operative risk and financial burden. On the basis of limitations, the use of alternative therapies, such as acupuncture, medicinal herbs is on the rise and according to reports; about 60-90% of dissatisfied arthritis patients are likely to use the complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) approach for overcoming pain and associated problems. An increasing number of people in the United States are adopting complementary or alternative medicine approaches to meet their personal health problems. Arthritis (both OA and RA) is one of the foremost diseases for which patient seeks option of complementary or alternative medicine. In treating osteoarthritis, glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, two of the molecular building blocks found in articular cartilage, are the most commonly used alternative supplements. Sandhivata nomenclature available in Ayurvedic literatures for this clinical entity, which is similar to Osteoarthritis. The cause of sandhivata in Ayurveda is attributed to improper diet, life style, and old age etc. leading to degeneration of body elements ( dhatu kshaya ), aggravation of vata; the humor responsible for all the movements and functions of the body and reduction in shleshaka kapha; a slimy substance present in the joints. The aggravated vata brings laghutva (lightness), rukshyata (dryness), kharatva causing degeneration. In sandhivata, sandhi shula (pain in affected joint) is the main feature. The other features are including shotha (swelling), stabdata (stiffness) and, atopa (crepitus) and difficulty in performing the functions of involved joint. Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of Osteoarthritis: Study 1: An open label, multicenter, non-comparative, prospective, pragmatic trial was done, in three centres CCRAS viz.

In the world it has been estimated that nearly 60 million people experience vision problems as a result of computer use. According to the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, computer vision syndrome affects about 90% of the people who spend three hours or more a day at a computer. Computer vision syndrome (CVS) is a group of symptoms which crop up from the extended viewing of the Video display terminal (VDT), when the demands of the task exceed the abilities of the viewer. Symptoms comprising CVS are dry and irritated eyes, eye strain/fatigue, blurred vision, redness in eyes, burning sensation of in the eyes, excessive tear secretion, double vision, headache, light or glare sensitivity, contact lens discomfort, slowness in changing focus, changes in color perception and pain in neck, shoulder and back. These symptoms of CVS are due to ocular (ocular-surface abnormalities or accommodative spasms) and/or extra ocular (ergonomic) etiologies. No remedial measures for the prevention or cure of this pathology prevail in the domain of modem medicine except using ocular surface lubricants, computer glasses, and counseling for judicious computer use. Dry eye syndrome is characterized by instability of the tear film or poor quality of tear filmthat cause to insufficient amount of tear production which results in increased evaporation of the tears. Dry and gritty feeling in the eyes is the main symptom of dry eye syndrome and additional symptoms such as burning sensation, foreign body sensation (sandy/scratchy/itching), pricking pain, rough lids/mucoid discharge/mild blepharitis, stuck eye lids, blurred vision, inflammation/redness, narrowing of palpebral aperture. Dry eye disease can also be subdivided into pure aqueous deficiency dry eye and evaporative dry eye On critical review of pathology of this disease it seems to be a Vata\u2014 Pittaja ocular cum systemic disease which needs systemic as well as topical treatment approach. Acharya Vagbatta has indicated cooling and rejuvenating therapies for eyes affected by bright light, high-voltage electric spark and heat exposure. This phenomenon is also close to the etiopathology of CVS.VOLUME-I Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of CVS: Study 1: The study was a prospective, open label single centre trial.The trial was executed at CCRAS Institute i.e. Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Cardiovascular Diseases (CARICD), New Delhi. In Preparatory phase, Hingwashtak chuma was given in a dose of 3- 5gms before meals twice a day for 3 days followed by Virechana with Avipattikar Chuma 5gms once at bed time with luke warm water. Nasya (nasal drops) with Anu Taila was given in a dose of 8-8 drops in the morning for 7 days (Day 1 to Day 7). Akshi Tarpana with Mahatriphaladya ghrita was done for 3 consecutive days in the morning and repeated at an interval of 15 days. (i.e. Day 8, Day 9, Day 10 and Day 26, Day 27 and Day 28 ) Mahatriphaladya Ghrita was also given orally in a dose of 5 ml twice a day on empty stomach in the morning and 3 hours before taking meals in the evening with luke warm water for total of 42 days starting from Day one. Reduction in signs and symptoms of CVS assessed by Visual Analogue scale. A significant (p<0.001) improvement in chief complaints was observed at all subsequent visits (8th, 26th and 42n d Day) and follow up (56th Day) compared to baseline. However effect of treatment on dry & irritated eyes and excessive tearing was statistically significant at 1% level on 8th day. Improvement in redness of eyes was thinsignificant on 8 day. No any change in safety parameters were noted thus the treatment was safe. The improvement remained steady even after two weeks of completion of treatment. This shows the efficacy and long-term benefits of the treatment. CTRI/2017/08/009518. Study 2: An open label clinical trial was done at Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Cardiovascular Diseases, New Delhi and at Ayurveda Regional Research Institute, Patna.

Menopause is a natural phenomenon and mostly occurs at the age of 50 to 52 years in a woman. Different stages, i.e., perimeno-pause, menopause, and postmenopause, comprise a half or a third of a woman's life, particularly in developing countries. It is characterized by an altered hormonal status and a subsequent decrease in quality of life, affect-ing each woman differently. Specifically, the decline and eventual cessation of estrogen production are associated with the appearance of uncomfortable symptoms (hot flushes, night sweats, breast tenderness, vaginal dryness, irregular menses, mood changes, and vaginal atrophy) as well as pathologies, such as osteoporosis, heart disease, hypercholesterolemia, endothelial dysfunction, vascular inflammation, hyperglycemia, and depression. Clinical studies indicate that the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in menopause needs to be carefully assessed and risks and benefits of the therapy should be evaluated by the clinician for each individual woman. Herbal preparations, food supplements, healthy living, and healthy mental status were mentioned as pos-sible alternatives for managing menopausal symptoms. In Ayurveda, Rajonivritti kala (the period of permanent cessation of menstrual cycle) is considered as 50 years mentioned by all classical texts without any controversy. It is a consequence of Jaraawastha (senility), and Vata remains dominant during this period. Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of menopausal syndrome: Study 1: A multicenter single-arm studywas conducted at three peripheral Institutes of Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, namely, Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Mother and Child Health Care, Nagpur; Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Skin Disorders, Ahmedabad; and Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for lifestyle related disorders, Thiru-vananthapuram.Total 116 menopausal women were recruited. Ashokarishta (Ayurvedic formulary of India. Part-I, 2nd ed. New Delhi: Department of AYUSH, Ministry of Health and family welfare, Government of India; 2003. p. 8.), Ashvagandha chuma (Ayurvedic pharmacopeia of Vol-I. 1st ed.

Ashokarishta was administered orally in a dose of 25 mltwice a day with equal quantity of water after food. Ash-vagandha chuma (3 gm) and Pravala pishti (one capsule of250 mg) were administered orally twice a day with milk just half an hour before food intake.At baseline, the MRS total score was 22.43 (8.24) and 36.82% reduction was seen 77.44% after 14 weeks. The effect of therapy has shown statistically significant (p-value <0.001) decrease in MRS total score. The test formulations also showed statistically significant (p < 0.001) improvement in all the three MRS subscale scores (somatic, psychological, and urogenital symptoms) at all time intervals when compared with their respective baseline score. In somatic subscale at the end of 14th week, the score was 2.23 (1.67) and 75.3% reduction was seen. Further, in psychological and urogenital subscales, the effect of the treatment was 74.17% (2.58 \u00b1 2.01) and 85% (0.51 \u00b1 1.13) respectively, at the end of 12 weeks and 75.87% (2.41 \u00b1 2.09) and 87.35% (0.43 \u00b1 0.98) at the end of 14 weeks respectively. A significant reduction in total MENQOL scores was observed after the treatment of 12 weeks and also at the end of 14 weeks (2-week follow-up period) in comparison to the baseline. Further, in vasomotor domain, the reduction in the symptoms at the end of 12 weeks was 2.3 (2.79), i.e., 77.84%, and 14 weeks 1.91 (2.5), i.e., 81.6% in comparison to baseline score, i.e., 10.38 (4.9); on psychosocial domain the reduction in the symptoms at the end of 12 weeks was 8.75 (6.54), i.e., 60.8% in com-parison with baseline score, i.e., 21.0 (7.54). Similarly, in physical domain, the reduction in the symptoms at the end of 12 weeks was 18.2 (11.8), i.e., 57.7%, and at the end of 14 weeks 16.9 (11.8), i.e., 60.8% in comparison with baseline, i.e., 42.98 (13.1). In sexual domain, the reduction of symptoms from baseline score was 3.6 (5.1) to 0.8 (2.33), i.e., 78.1% at the end of 12 weeks and 0.7 (2.2), i.e., 80.6% at the end of 14 weeks. CTRI/2012/03/002538 Conclusion: Ayurveda intervention are effective in thetreatment of menopause-associated symptoms and can promote the quality of life of menopausal woman. Hence, these Ayurvedic formulations can be used effectively for the management of menopausal symptoms in place ofHRT and other therapies.VOLUME-I Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) 118 1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI 2.29: CONJUNCTIVITIS Background Allergic Conjunctivitis is a mild, nonspecific inflammation of the conjunctiva due to allergy with symptoms of redness (mainly due to vasodilatation of the peripheral small blood vessels), edema (swelling) of the conjunctiva, itching (most typical symptom of ocular allergy) and increased lacrimation (production of the tears) without any known specific condition for pathology to develop or with undermined etiology that is mostly and easily attributed to allergy. Symptoms are usually worse for patients when weather is warm and dry, whereas cooler temperatures and rain tend to minimize symptoms. It is a very common ocular problem in routine ophthalmic practice. Conjunctiva is very much sensitive about ten times to skin. It has been reported that allergic conjunctivitis alters patient's routine limiting certain activities such as going outdoors, reading, sleeping and driving in addition to the physical discomfort. The symptoms are due to release of histamine and other active substances by mast cells which in turn stimulate dilatation of blood vessels, irritate nerve endings and increase tear secretion. Therefore treating patients with allergic conjunctivitis may improve their everyday quality of life. Modem trend of management to such conditions advocates avoidance of the allergen and treatment with either topical or systemic steroids/decongestant drops/mast cell stabilizers along with antihistamine and anti-inflammatory agents. This management is not much satisfactory and seems to be temporary, used only during exacerbations and also has their side/adverse effects. Considering this; it becomes very necessary to find out safe and effective drug which could effectively treat such conditions. There is vivid description of many Ayurvedic formulations and procedures in Ayurveda classics which are beneficial in the treatment of such conditions. Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of conjunctivitis: Study 1: A prospective open label multicentre trial was done. A total of 54 participants were enrolled at two centres viz; Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Infectious Diseases, Patna and Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Cardiovascular Diseases, New Delhi. The study medications included quality assured Mahatriphaladya Ghrita in the dose of 15 ml twice daily was given with lukewarm water (empty stomach in the morning & 3 hours before meals in the evening) for a period of 12 weeks and topical instillation (aschyotana) of 10VOLUME-I 119 Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) VOLUME-I iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii drops of Triphala kwath in the conjuctival sac in supine position was done twice a day for 12 weeks. Before treatment all subjects were subjected to a preparatory phase comprising of Dipana for 3 days with Hingvastaka Chuma 3-5 g (based on assessment of Agni) orally before meal twice a day with lukewarm water followed by Virechana with Avipattikar Chuma 5 g once at bedtime with lukewarm water. The study revealed significant improvement in the common complaints of patients suffering from allergic conjunctivitis. The complaint of redness was observed in 56.48% patients at baseline which was reduced to 5.09% patients at the end of treatment (<0.001). Complaint of anxiety was observed in 32.41% patients at baseline which was reduced to 4.63% patients at the end of treatment (<0.001).and lacrimation was observed 49.07% patients at baseline which was reduced to 5.56% patients at the end of treatment (<0.001), photophobia was observed 41.2% patients at the baseline which was reduced to 4.63% patients at the end of treatment (<0.001), burning was observed 43.98% at the baseline which was reduced to 6.48% at the end of treatment (<0.001), foreign body sensation was observed 39.35% at baseline which was reduced to 3.24% at the end of treatment (<0.001). No any adverse effect was found in the study.

Accordingly Geriatrics is emerging as a major medical specialty world over. In India too the last decade has projected significantly rising rate of population-aging and hence a great need is now felt to strengthen the geriatric care system in this fast developing most populous country. Ayurveda is essentially the science of life and longevity. It presents a sound concept of aging, its prevention and management. Ayurveda specially incorporates Rasayana Tantra as one of its Astanga specialties, which is exclusively devoted to nutrition, immunology and geriatrics. Aging is essentially a physiological phenomenon which results because of overwhelming of inherent evolutionary processes by the involutionary (involuntary) changes occurring in the mind-body system. The main issue in geriatric care is not merely the concern about the physiological phenomenon which is inevitable; rather it is more the medical health problems afflicting an individual in old age warranting medical management in order to sustain a comfortable and healthy aging. Thus geriatric care has to address to two-fold problems, firstly the basic anti-aging care to retard the rate of physiological aging and secondly the medical management of diseases and disorders. Ayurveda has addressed these issues in a unique holistic manner involving not merely the biological care, rather also encompassing the psychosocial and spiritual dimensions. There are strong possibilities to develop a safe and cost-effective package for geriatric care on the basis of Ayurvedic life-style management, Rasayana therapy and by practice of Yoga. Whatever is possible through the control of mind and prana, can be acquired through it. Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of geriatric care: Study 1: A study was done to evaluate the Rasayana effect and clinical safety of Ashwagandhadi lehya on apparently healthy elderly individuals at three peripheral institutes of CCRAS viz. Achanta Lakshmipathi Research Centre for Ayurveda, Chennai; Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Metabolic Disorders, Bangalore; RRA Podar Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Cancer, Mumbai. Ashwagandhadi Lehya was given in the dose of 10 gm BD after meals with Luke warm milk for 12 wks (84 days).

Total 156 healthy elderly volunteers of 50-75 years were included in the study. The symptoms like Dizziness, Constipation, Urge incontinence, Aching muscles, Pain in joints, Stiffness in joints, Abnormal sleep, Loss of appetite, Fatigue, Generalized weakness and Sense of wellbeing is measured by using Visual analogue scale (VAS) at baseline were statistically highly significant (P <0.001) in every visit till the end of 84th day and sustained the result in the Follow up (FU) visit also. The Rasayana effect of Ashwagandhadi lehya in improving quality of life by using WHO-QOL BREF SCORE i.e. Physical health (Domain 1), Psychological (Domain 2), Environment (Domain 4) at Baseline with 84th day & FU were highly significant (P <0.001) and it is significant in case of Social relationship (Domain 3) (Table 1.30.1) at Baseline with 84th and FU consecutively (P = 0.002, 0.001). Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Score (HAM-D) also shows highly significant improvement. The statistical analysis of Rasayana effect of Ashwagandhadi lehya on PGI Memory Scale like Remote Memory, Recent Memory, Mental balance, Attention & Concentration, Delayed Recall, Immediate Recall, Verbal retention for Similar Pairs, Verbal Retention for Dissimilar Pairs, Visual Retention, Visual Recognition and PGI Memory Total Score at Baseline with 84th and FU were highly significant (P <0.001). No any adverse effect was noted. Study 2: The clinical study was undertaken at three peripheral institutes viz. CARIHD, Bhubaneswar; CARIDD, Kolkata and RARIMD, included in the study. Brahma Rasayana in the dose of 15 grams twice a day with luke warm milk was given orally for a period of 12 weeks. It was observed from the study that Brahma Rasayana has highly significant effect (p<0.0001) on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale after a period of 84 days. Brahma Rasayana provided highly significant effect (p<0.0001 ) on the individual domains of PGI Memory Scale, viz. recent memory, mental balance, attention & concentration, delayed recall, immediate recall, verbal retention for dissimilar pairs, visual retention, visual recognition and also in PGI Memory Total Score. In the domain; Verbal retention for similar pairs, it was highly significant in the level of p<0.001.

BUDfflMANDYATA (COGNITIVE DEFICIT) Background Cognitive deficit or cognitive impairment is an inclusive term to describe any characteristic that acts as a barrier to the cognition process. The term may describe deficits in global intellectual performance, such as mental retardation. Learning disorders, dyslexia are some specific types of the cognitive deficits, the other may be drug induced cognitive/memory impairment such as cognitive impairment caused by glucocorticoids, and benzodiazepines It is an intellectual impairment which begins in childhood due to which child shows significant limitations in their ability to learn and function. It may range from vast intellectual impairment with minimal functioning to mild impairment in specific tasks. The areas which may get affected in cognitive deficit may be attention, decision making, perception, judgment, reasoning, memory, language, general knowledge and many more. In children, the impairment leads to poor orientation in academic tasks, school work will be disorganized, and frequently incomplete and are prone to behavioral disturbances. The cause of Cognitive deficits may be congenital or may caused by environmental factors such as brain injuries, neurological disorders or mental illness Cognitive deficit can be correlated with Budhimandyata in Ayurveda. According to Ayurveda Budhimandyata occurs due to Beeja Dosa (genetic factor), Ahitaahara & Vihara (incompatible and improper diet, emotional and behavioral factors of the mother (karma, asaya, kala, dosa, ahara, vihara) disturbs the endocrinal system and digestive system which further leads to abnormalities in the shape , color and emotions of fetus ( Bhela has enumerated genetic factor (beejadosa) of parents along with improper diet (apathy), suppression o f natural urges ( vegadharana ), and gynecological disorders (yonidosa) as the causative factors for fetal disorders (garbhavikriti) like cognitive deficit. According to Sushruta non fulfillment of desires of pregnant women (dauhridyaavamanana) leads to vitiation of vatadosa in fetus and produces various diseases like cognitive deficit, mental retardation, other abnormalities and even death (jada/mandabudhi etc.). He also added that atheism of parents and their bad deeds in previous life are also causes various abnormalities like Buddhi Mandyata in fetus.VOLUME-I Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) 126 1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of Cognitive deficit: Study 1: An interventional, open label executed at Advanced Center for Ayurveda in Mental Health & Neurosciences Bangalore.

Iron deficiency anemia is the most significant contributor of all types of anemia and around 30 to 52% of non-industrialised population has anemia in general and iron deficiency in particular. Iron deficiency anemia was considered as one among the top 10 risks globally and regionally. It causes 8.4 lakh deaths and 35 million cases of disability adjusted life years. Anemia is defined as qualitative and quantitative reduction of circulating RBC and/or the percentage of hemoglobin concentration in relation to standard age and sex. The prevalence of anemia in all the age groups is higher in India as compared with other developing countries. The main reasons for IDA have been determined to be inadequate intake of iron, low bioavailability of dietary iron from plant foods due to inhibitory factors, low levels of absorption enhancers in the diet, and increased needs during growth and development among children and adolescents. Anemia and iron deficiency are known to have several functional consequences. In children, IDA adversely affects cognitive performance, behavior, and physical growth. Preventive strategies are through food-based approaches that cause multi-nutritional benefit. Conventional approach for EDA is through iron supplements, such as ferrous sulfate. Adherence to this type of medication is difficult due to various side effects, such as epigastric discomfort, nausea, diarrhea, or constipation. Side effects can be minimized by drug intake along with food; however, doing this reduces the iron absorption by 40%. Iron preparations inhibit the absorption of other drugs, such as tetracyclines, sulfonamides, and trimethoprim. Hence, there is a need to look for newer agents that have better therapeutic utility and less adverse effects. Complementary and alternative medicine or traditional medicines, which are widely used by the ailing community, need to be explored. Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of IDA: Study 1: An open-labeled prospective multicenter clinical trial was conducted at three peripheral institutes, viz.; Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Nutritional Disorders, Mandi; M.S. Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Endocrine Disorders, Jaipur; and Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Respiratory Disorders Patiala. A total of 150 patients were enrolled in the study. Patients of either sex aged between 18 and 50 years, withVOLUME-I Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) 128 1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI hemoglobin level ranging from 8 to 10 gm% and serum ferritin level. The trial drug (Navayasa Chuma) in capsule form was administered to selected patients in the dose of 1 gm (2 capsules of 500 mg each) twice daily after food along with water as anupana for a period of 90 days. Weakness was observed in 97.3% patients initially and was completely absent in 46.7% of cases by the end of 120 days. Symptoms, such as fatigue, dizziness, headache, palpitation, shortness of breath got completely relieved in 66.0, 44.7, 44.7, 42.0, and 43.3% respectively. Navayasa Chuma provided highly significant statistical results in hemoglobin level at every follow-up period (p-value). By the 90th day, 18% of patients achieved normocytic normochromic blood smear picture, while 24% of patients achieved it in 120 days. There is no any significant change in the total leukocyte count, differential leukocyte count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate with baseline. No significant change in mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), reticulocyte count, and serum iron levels were witnessed after the trial. Significant change was observed in packed cell volume (PCV) percentage and total iron binding capacity. No any adverse effect was noted in the study. Study 2: A prospective open-label multicenter trial executed at three peripheral centers viz. Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Respiratory Disorders, Patiala, M.S. Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Endocrine Disorders, Jaipur, and Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Hepatobiliary Disorders, Bhubaneswar. A total of 103 patients were recruited in the study. The study medications included Punarnavadi Mandura in the dose of 500 mg (two tablets of 250 mg) twice daily given with water for a period of 12 weeks and Dadimadi Ghrita in a dose of 10 gm twice daily given orally before food, with lukewarm water. The complaint of weakness was observed in 89 patients at baseline, which reduced by 25%, and was found only in 66 patients at the end of treatment. Complaint of fatigue reduced in 43.8% patients and dizziness reduced in 68.5% patients. A significant reduction was also seen in the complaint of headache, which reduced in 75.08% patients. Effect of the study medications was also assessed by paired t-test on hematological parameters compared at baseline and at 84th day. Table 4 shows the results of the analysis on hematological parameters. Mean hemoglobin (g/dL) level increased from baseline value of 9.29 to 9.40 at 84th day, which was, however, not statistically significant. A significant increase in mean serum iron (ng/dL) level (p = 0.005) was also seen, which rose from baseline value of 41.13 to 50.02 at the end of the treatment.VOLUME-I Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I Conclusion: The studies have shown very promising results in the management of Iron Deficiency Anemia or Nutritional Anemia with Ayurvedic intervention.VOLUME-I Table 2.32.1: Effect of the treatment on haematological parameters in study 1 Parameters (n=150) Baseline 90 as Mean (SD), $ Compared using paired t-test at baseline and 84th day, * p-value of <0.05 has been considered as significant Table 2.32.2: Effect of the treatment on chief complaints in study 1 Presence of Chief Complaints (n = 150) Baseline 90\"* day 120th day Weakness 146 (97.3) 90 (60.0) 80 (53.3) Fatigue 144 (96.0) 57 (38.0) 45 (30.0) Dizziness 96 (64.0) 26 (17.3) 29 (19.3) Headache 111 (74.0) 32 (21.3) 44 (29.3) Palpitation 98 (65.3) 32 (21.3) 35 (23.3) Shortness of breath 117(78.0) 55 (36.7) 52 (34.7) Irritability 125 (83.3) 50 (33.3) 44 (29.3) Pallor 111 (74.0) 82 (54.7) 67 (44.7) Values are expressed as n (%) Table 2.32.3: Table 3: Effect of the treatment on chief complaints in study 2 Chief Complaints (n = 90) Baseline 84th day Follow up 14th week Weakness 89 (98.9) 66 (73.3) 64 (71.1) Fatigue 89 (98.9) 50 (55.6) 40 (44.4) Dizziness 54 (60.0) 17(18.9) 14 (15.6) Headache 52 (57.8) 13 (14.4) 14 (15.6) Palpitation 29 (32.2) 08 (8.9) 07 (7.8) Shortness of breath 21 (23.3) 08 (8.9) 09 (10.0) Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) 130 VOLUME-I iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiM M M i Irritability 47 (52.2) 12(13.3) 09 (10.0) Taste disturbances 18 (20.0) 06 (6.7) 06 (6.7) Pallor 54 (60.0) 39 (43.3) 39 (43.3) Brittle nails (Spoon shaped) 01 (1.1) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Pica 10(11.1) 03 (3.3) 02 (2.2) Glossitis Angular stomatitis (Sores at comers of the mouth)10(11.1) 02 (2.2) 02 (2.2) Ringing in the ears 14 (15.6) 01 (1.1) 0 (0.0) Values are expressed as n (%) Fig. 2.32.1: Effect of the treatment on Serum Iron levels in study 1 and study 2 60 50 40 30 20 10I Baseline l Post treatment Study 1 Study 2 Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I 2.33: OSTEOPENIA/OSTEOPOROSIS BACKGROUND Osteopenia/Osteoporosis is a condition characterised by decrease in Bone Mineral Density. According to estimates, out of the 230 million Indians expected to be over the age of 50 years in 2015,20%, i.e., almost 46 million, are women with osteoporosis. Thus, osteoporosis is a major public health problem especially for women, in India. It is also one of the major risk factor for fractures, especially among elderly women. Osteoporosis is a silent disease until it is complicated by fractures that occur following minimal trauma or, in some cases, with no trauma. Dietary changes, supplementation of Vitamin D and calcium supplementation, anti-resorptive agents and hormonal therapies along with exercise, regular monitoring of Bone Mineral Density and assessment of biomarkers related to bone tumour are advised in the management of this condition. The clinical picture of Osteopenia/Osteoporsis is similar to the condition of Asthidhatukshaya described in Ayurveda which is characterized by the gradual loss of quality ( Saarata ) of Asthidhatu leading to increased predisposition to other bone related pathologies. It happens due to the prakopa of Vata that occurs in Asthi. Prithvi, Ap and Vayumahabhutas contribute to the formation and function of asthidhatu. When qualities of asthidhatu such as guru, kathina, sthirae tc gets reduced due to vitiation of Vata, asthisoushirya occurs resulting in the inability of asthidhatu to perform its normal function of dehadharana. Complex treatment approaches including medication, purification techniques including Panchakarma, diet and lifestyle advices etc. are useful in the management of this condition. Council has done following studies since inception for validation of classical drugs in the management of Osteopenia/Osteoporsis: Study 1: A prospective open label multicenter trial was executed at two peripheral centers viz. Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Drug Development, Gwalior and at Raja RamdeoAnandilalPoddar Ayurveda Cancer Research Institute, Mumbai.The patients were administered orally J^akshaGuggulu, lgm twice daily (500mg tablet), twice a day after food with lukewarm Water and Mukta-ShuktiPishti, 250 mg twice daily (250 mg capsule),twice a day after food with lukewarm Water for 12 weeks.

Total 90 patients were enrolled. The trial combination showed a decreasing trend in Serum Osteocalcin, reduction in Serum Bone specific Alkaline Phosphatase and significant decrease in mean domain score of all domains of QUALEFFO- 41 scale parameters. No any adverse effect was noted in the study.CTRI/2015/01/005406. Conclusion: Evaluation of safety and efficacy of LakshaGuggulu, Mukta-ShuktiPishti, AshwagandhaChuma and PravalaPishti were done through studies conducted at peripheral institutes of CCRAS spread throughout various bio-geographical areas of India. The analysis of outcome gives very promising results in the management of Osteopenia/Osteoporosis. No adverse reactions were noticed during the trial period. Hence Ayurveda intervention is safe and effective in the management of Osteopenia/Osteoporosis.VOLUME-I Table 2.33.1: Effect of trial drugs on Osteoporosis related imaging and blood biochemical parameters in study 2 ________________________________________________ Osteoporosis related blood biochemical parameters (n=90)Baseline 84th Day t (50 Glorious years) VOLUME-I iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii Table 2.33.2: Safety profile of the patients in two clinical trials Parameters LakshaGuggulunndMukta- ShuktiPishti(n = 88)AshwagandhaChurnaaadPravalaPishti (n = 90) BT AT p-value BT AT p-value Liver Function Test using paired t-test, p-value of <0.05 has been considered as significant Fig 2.3.1: Improvement in clinical symptoms in study 1 H im ?, of ww* P T ilBnticline ) PUKrK n iw. c jI a tt i al-Sith \u00bb t'F T M 'H l in no, of C Jin fll J V iO ctiilQ llow L 1 1 1 Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) VOLUME-I ^^^^^^^iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii Fig 2.33.2: Effect of trial drugs on QUALEFFO-41 T e u dart* Jiv in g [N c hm jvr W irn iE ir i Jw jU h fimdiftn U faHlw Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) 1 1 INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI IVOLUME-I CHAPTER 3 DRUG DEVELOPMENT The Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences has been engaged in clinical research and drug development of new/ coded formulations based on leads from classical texts, contemporary scientific and pharmacological leads for important diseases of National importance based on strength of Ayurveda and leads from folk lore claims collected by the council from various parts of India.

AYUSH 64: ANTIMALARIAL DRUG Background Malaria, a tropical diseases is widely prevalent all over the world and has claimed millions of lives. However, by using modem anti-malarial drugs like quinine, chloroquine & also insecticides to kill mosquitoes the disease is temporarily controlled. Nevertheless, it has been found that mosquitoes have developed immunity to the insecticides and their breeding, continues unabated. It has also been realized that the modem allopathic anti-malarial drugs are highly toxic and their repeated use causes numerous side- effects resulting in ocular disturbances etc. Descriptions concerning its aetiopathogenesis, clinical features and line of management are detailed under ' Vishamajwara ' in ancient classical literature of Ayurveda. Two types of Mashak (Mosquito's) bite features are encountered in Ayurvedic literature ( Charak Chikitsa 23/157) where in one is curable (mild toxic) with complaints of itching, slight swelling and mild pain; the other is incurable (potent toxic/fatal) one wherein on biting, features of incurable insect bite like expansion of swelling, burning sensation & intense smell at biting spot, heaviness in the eyes,dyspnoea, fever, bodyache, vomiting, , diarrhoea, thirst, loss of order to provide safe, inexpensive and effective remedy for malaria, CCRAS has developed a poly herbal safe, anti-malarial drug 'Ayush-64' through extensive pharmacological, toxicological and clinical studies.

AYUSH-56: An Ayurvedic Anti-Epileptic Drug Background Epilepsy (Apasmara) is a transient loss of consciousness with terrifying physical movements bom of derangement of memory, intellect and mind. Epilepsy is a Greek word meaning \"A condition of being overcome or seized or attached\". The clinical picture of Apasmara presented in Ayurveda and that of epilepsy in modem medicine are almost identical. Ayurveda considered the involvement of both body and mind in the causation of the disease. About 30%of th e patients of epilepsy do not respond to the current available modem drugs besides their adverse effects. In view if this, the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, through extensive pharmacological/toxicological and clinical studies has evolved a new safe toxic coded drug Ayush-56 for the management of epilepsy. This has been patented by the Council through National Research and Development Corporation, New Delhi. (Patent No: 141170)VOLUME-I Drug Profile Ingredients Botanical name Parts used 1. Marsilea minuta Profile: Acute and sub-acute toxicity studies revealed no toxic effects of the drug. Clinical Efficacy: Clinical studies on 423 subjects were carried out at three peripheral research Institutes/Units of the Council to ascertain the efficacy of Ayush-56 in the treatment of Epilepsy (Apasmara). The study showed significant reduction (65%) in frequency and duration of epileptic fits. It is found useful as on add on to the modem anti-epileptic treatment. No adverse event in prescribed doses was reported. Further, no withdrawal effect was observed after slowly tapering the modem medicine with this drug.

NIMBATIKTAM FOR DUODENAL ULCER Pharmacological Profile: drug in 20 mg/kg dose level (P.O.) was found to have significant anti-ulcer activity in shay ulcers in rats and histamine ulcer in guinea pigs. The same dose had significant anti peptic activity in rats and guinea pigs. However, 40 mg/kg dose possessed anti-secretary effect in shay rats. The ulcer healing effect of Nimbatiktam could be attributed to its anti-secretary and anti-peptic activity associated with an enhancement of local healing process. Clinical efficacy > Nimbidin Extract 100 mg was administered twice daily in 13 cases of active duodenal ulcer for 60 days. Ulcer completely healed as observed in the review endoscopy in 3 patients, ulcer healing was in process in 5 patients, no healing effect was observed in 5 patients at the end of trial. > Nimbatiktam 150 mg was administered thrice daily with water for 30 days at Council's peripheral institute.

AYUSH POSHAK YOGA and PEYA for immuno-modulatory, anti-stress and general health promotion Background Ayurveda emphasizes on prevention of disease and improve the quality of health as well as life span. A number of medicinal plants have been recommended for this purpose. These plants provide specific resistance and make the body strong to counteract any adverse physical, chemical or biological stress. The people belonging to Antarctica region are exposed to environmental stress viz. cold, mental and nutritional stress including others factors like radiations, food preservatives etc. which generate free-radicals in the body thus suppressing the immune system and causing early ageing. To combat such adverse situations, Council developed Ayush poshakyoga and peya for improving general wellbeing.VOLUME-I Papaver somniferum L.

SHUNTHI GUGGULU: Rheumatoid Arthritis ( Amavata ) Background Rheumatoid Arthritis (Amavata) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease that causes pain, swelling, stiffness, destruction, and functional disability in the affected joints. In chronic cases, the disease may cause deformity and total incapacitation. Descriptions concerning aetiopathogenesis, clinical features and line of management are detailed under Amavata in Ayurveda. According to Ayurveda, the main cause of the disease is formation of Ama due to Agnimandya i.e gastrointestinal dysfunction. The cardinal features of Amavata are swelling and severe pain that seems to be of scorpion bite over the joints and other symptoms include body pain, loss of appetite, excessive thirst, laziness, heaviness of the body and fever. The general principles of treatment of this disease in Ayurveda lay emphasis on stimulating and normalizing the impaired Agni for the correction of digestion and metabolism. Based on the cardinal features and other associated features, use of different herbal, herbo-mineral preparations & regimens are described in Ayurvedic classics. CCRAS has developed a herbal safe Ayurvedic Drug for Rheumatoid Arthritis ( Amavata) through a series of clinical studies.VOLUME-I Drug Profile S. N. Ingredient Botanical Name 1.

KSHARSUTRA IN ANO RECTAL DISORDERS Background Improper food habits and faulty life styles are the main causes of ill health. This may lead to abnormal bowel movement, which if persists, causes various ano-rectal diseases. Besides the above, heredity also has its contribution towards this disease. Commonly occurring ano-rectal diseases are fistula-in-ano, piles and fissure in-ano. The chronicity and recurrent nature of these diseases leaves physical and psychological agony to the sufferer. Ksharasutra, a unique para surgical measure is advocated in Ayurveda to treat these disorders. Ksharasutra involves insertion of a medicated thread into the fistulous tract. It has many advantages over the modem surgical measure. Application of Ksharasutra is an OPD measure; which does not require hospitalization, heavy medication and is completely safe with an advantage of simultaneous cutting and healing. Tissue damage is very less, hence chance of infection is very minimal and rate of recurrence is negligible .It is economic, minimal invasive and the patients can carry out their routine work during the treatment. This measure has been very well accepted/ adopted by the practitioners of Ayurveda and such services are being provided at various clinical facilities of CCRAS in the country.

AYUSH BALARASAYANA for promotion of health in children Background Malnutrition is the underlying contributing factor in about 45% of all child deaths under the age of 5. It makes children more vulnerable to severe diseases. From the end of the neonatal period and through the first 5 years of life, the main causes of death are preterm birth complications, intrapartum-related complications, diarrhoea, pneumonia and malaria. According to WHO, the mortality rate of children under 5 years is very alarming. 5.9 million Children under age five died in 2015, at the approximate rate of 16 000 every day. Ayurveda, the ancient science of life provides utmost focus on promotion/maintenance of health. The susceptibility of young children towards various infections or diseases is mainly due to their poor immunity. The Rasayana drugs provide longevity optimum strength of physique, improves memory and intelligence. Considering the general ailments affecting the infants and children, the Ayushbalarasayana has been scientifically developed by the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences for promotion of health in children and patented through National Research and Development Corporation, New Delhi.

In spite of enormous expenditure incurred to improve health standards of the masses, diarrhoea still poses the same threat especially in rural areas. Although it is not a deadly disease as such yet due to ignorance, lack of medical facilities and late treatment, children suffer heavily and by the time they reach some proper medical institution the cases turn complicated to the extent of irreversible state .1 Considering the gravity of the disease, the Ayush Ghutti has been scientifically developed by the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) to prevent diarrhoea and fever in children. This is useful for development of proper digestion and assimilation as well as prevents the said disease conditions in childhood.

AYURVEDIC FORMULATIONS FOR ANTENATAL CARE Background Pregnancy and child birth is a joyful event in every woman's life. The growing foetus is totally dependent on its own mother in every aspect. Thus a proper antenatal care would result in a good maternal and foetal outcome. Any negligence towards her health may lead to untoward effects and thus cause maternal & foetal complications or even could be fatal. Ayurveda has described \"Garbhini Paricharya\" i.e. antenatal care right from conception up to the birth of the baby. In Ayurveda, antenatal care comprises of Aahar (dietary regimens), Vi/zara (life style) and Aushadhi (medicines). In view of the potential of Ayurveda in promoting the health of pregnant women and foetus, it is high time to mainstream Ayurvedic management. The Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, New Delhi has developed certain formulations viz. AYUSH AG Tablet, AYUSH PG Tablet, AYUSH GG Tablet and AYUSH AD candy for antenatal care to promote the health of pregnant women and foetus and minimize the complications associated with pregnancy and mortality rate mother and foetus.

Council is dedicatedly working in validation and standardization of the fundamentals of Ayurveda in all aspects viz. Clinical methods, diagnostics, literary, pharmaco-therapeutics in order to generate tangible evidence for Ayurveda. Following work has been done in the fundamentals of diagnostic methods of Ayurveda 4.1 DEVELOPM ENT AND VALIDATION OF PRAKRITI ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE/SCALE The individualized treatment of diseases is the unique approach of Ayurveda which recognizes every individual with a specific constitution vis-a-vis Prakriti. Ayurveda classifies all individuals into specific types of ' PrakritV based on the theory of Tridosha (Three humours as functional entities of the body) i.e. Vata, Pitta & Kapha and their relative ratios. Prakriti of an individual is decided during the intra-uterine life which may be broadly envisaged into seven types i.e. relative predominance of one dosha (Eka doshaja Prakriti ), two doshas ( dwi-doshaja ) and due to the three doshas (Sama Prakriti)). Sama Prakriti persons are less susceptible to any disease while the rest of them are always likely to suffer. Vataja Prakriti persons are more prone to get afflicted with Vataja diseases (e.g. bodyaches, Joint disorders & neuro-muscular problems etc.), similarly Pittaja Prakriti individuals are prone to get afflicted with Paittika diseases (e.g. Acid peptic disorders, skin diseases & inflammatory reactions etc.) and Kaphaja Prakriti individuals are susceptible to Kaphaja diseases (e.g. respiratory diseases, worm infestations & itching problems etc.) during their life span. The determination of Prakriti has significant importance in healthy / unhealthy states of an individual. This information can be successfully applied clinically in diagnosis, treatment (for deciding appropriate drug, dose, duration, diet and life style) and prognosis of the disease. Even the daily and seasonal regimens adopted for promotion of health also vary according to Prakriti.VOLUME-I Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I For the determination of Prakriti, the characteristic features mentioned in Ayurvedic texts are subjective in nature and the clinicians/Ayurvedic experts apply their own wisdom and experience to capture these features. There is a need to develop a uniform method for capturing these predictors for assessment and reliability of the data which is lacking in the public domain. Based on these observations it was strongly felt that a Standardized Prakriti Assessment Tool is the need of the hour. Considering the above facts, Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS), being an apex organization under Ministry of AYUSH, Govt, of India, New Delhi has undertaken the initiative to develop the 'Prakriti Assessment Scale ' with rationality, reliability, validity and reproducibility. The project comprises the following major tasks 1. Development of a comprehensive questionnaire/scale for assessment of Prakriti 2. Development of SoPs for the application of questionnaire/scale in the form of User Manual 3. Validation of the questionnaire/scale 4. Development of Software for the validated Prakriti assessment tool 1. Development of a comprehensive questionnaire/scale for assessment of Prakriti Following steps have been under taken- a) Preparation of an exhaustive list of characteristic features (Predictors) for assessment of Prakriti available in the classical texts of Ayurveda (Pooling up of items) All predictors for determination of the Prakriti as mentioned together. An exhaustive list of 583 predictors has been prepared. Utmost care has been taken to include each and every possible predictor described in the classics. As the terminology of the predictors is in Sanskrit language, the nearest translation of each predictor has been determined in English after detailed discussions with Ayurveda experts of Basic principles ( Maulik Siddhant), Medicine (Kayachikitsa) and other disciplines so as to match theVOLUME-I Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) 166 1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI exact meaning with applied (clinical) approach. Wherever the exact correlate was not available, definition of the Sanskrit terminology has been given. b) Reduction of predictors The list of the predictors was thoroughly analyzed and it has been found that- some predictors are repetitive some are having same meaning with different terminology some predictors are the outcome indicators of a particular Prakriti some predictors are difficult to assess due to ethical issues. All the above points has been considered to reduce the predictors in the manner elaborated below: Predictors recurring twice/ multiple times were removed to avoid repetition, e.g. Bhurikrodha (Short tempered) is mentioned both in Ashtanga Samgraha & Ashtanga Hridaya; Dantakhadi (Grinding of teeth mentioned Ashtanga Samgraha & Sushruta Samhita', Samhita. The number of predictors after reduction is 471. It has also been found that some predictors are nearly synonyms or equivalents as they are conveying the similar meaning e.g. Apachita (Charaka Samhita)/Krisha (Sushruta Samhita)/Krisha akriti (Ashtanga Hridaya) were conveying the clinical sense as thin built only. As per linguistics these terms though are dissimilar, but are capturing similar features clinically. Thus such type of terms have been merged together, i.e. all such terms have been reduced into one predictor. Further, some predictors are found as probable outcome indicators of a particular Prakriti and not directly helpful in assessing the Prakriti that are difficult toVOLUME-I Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I assess on ethical ground like Kalahapriya (quarrelling in nature), etc. have also been removed from the list. After reduction by following the above methods, the number of predictors has been reduced to 215 from 583. c) The method developed for capturing of each predictor The methods for capturing these predictors have been discussed in a series of consultative expert group meetings comprising of experts from both Ayurveda and modem fraternity (as required). After several discussions, the methodology to capture each and every predictor clinically has been taken into account. As the predictors are features related to physical, physiological, psychological and behavioural traits, they are broadly grouped into these four traits which are further sub-grouped into various domains e.g. built, appearance, skin texture etc. It has been inferred that three methods can be applied for capturing the predictors i.e. (i) Anthropometric measurement, (ii) Observation and (iii) questionnaire 2. Development of SoPs for the application of questionnaire/scale in the form of User Manual The Standard Operative Procedures (SOPs) for capturing each predictor have been developed by adopting above methodology. The same has been elaborately discussed in 'National Consultative Expert Group Meet' comprising of learned experts from various fields of Ayurveda and other contemporary sciences for content validity. 3. Validation of the questionnaire through multi-centre studies for construct validity of developed Prakriti assessment Scale For construct validity the developed scale has been given to 20 Ayurvedic physicians, already trained on User Manual, at 10 centers situated at different geographical regions of the country for a sample size of 500.

VALIDATION AND RELIABILITY TESTING OF AYURVEDA DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS Diagnosis forms the most important part of any medicine as this directly influence the outcome of any treatment. Diagnosis in Ayurveda can be grouped into Roga Pareeksha and Rogi Pareeksha. The examination Astasthana and Dasavidha Pareeksha commonly. Ayurveda has dealt with these examination methods in depth but attaining a uniform diagnosis encompassing all these factors after detailed examination still remains difficult. Bio-medicine has come up with excellent tools of case recording for the purpose of diagnosis. Current Ayurveda graduates are exposed to both systems and though there is an arbitrary system in place to achieve the objective of clinical case recording, the reproducibility in terms of measurable parameters is non-uniform and hence the diagnosis comes out vague. Keeping in view, it's the need of the hour to \"prepare standardized diagnostic protocol(s)/tools\" which are aptly integrated with latest Information Technology tools such as Internet o f things (IoT) to aid Ayurvedic Physician in proper diagnosis and assessment of roga, rogibala and achieve the objective of \" Anapayi Chikitsa\". Objective (s) To develop Standardized Ayurvedic Case Taking Protocol(SACTP) in consideration with elements of diagnosis/Case recording from Ayurveda and current Standard health record format(s) is the primary objective and developing standard diagnostic protocols for selected diseases frequently managed is considered in conjunction for uniform diagnosis. Developing an interface for integration/ Customization and development of diagnostic gadgets which are integrated with latest information technology tools for accurate and easy diagnosis is the secondary objective. Methodology A Standardized Ayurvedic Case Taking Protocol incorporating comprehensive patient history, recording the disease in Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) format wherein subjective and objective parameters are recorded in problem oriented medical record format (POMR) examination of etiology, recording of parameters of Dasavidha Pareeksha, in-depth recording of Samprapthi Ghataka to assess pathogenesis of the disease is to be prepared and it includes the following steps:VOLUME-I Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) 170 VOLUME-I iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiM M M i 1.

Intra Mural Research Scheme: The regular scientific staff of CCRAS are at liberty to develop the project keeping in view the following areas: National Priority Areas, Mandate of the Institute, Strength areas of Ayurveda 2. Collaborative Research Scheme at National level: There are certain areas in which infrastructure/facilities available at CCRAS peripheral institutes are not adequate. There is a need of support from other reputed institutes where such facilities along with expertise are available e.g. areas of cancer, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, leprosy etc. Further, there are some other areas like filariasis, bronchial asthma, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, diabetes mellitus including complication, rheumatoid arthritis etc. in which the association of other specialized institutes will boost the quality of research. 3. Collaborative Research Scheme at International level: Due to increasing global interest in Ayurveda, very often foreign countries have shown interest to collaborate in the field of research in Ayurveda and it has become imperative on the part of the Council to initiate/ execute/coordinate or monitor such activities. CCRAS has laid guidelines for such collaborations. 4. Collaborative research in Ayurveda with industries: Benchmarks have been laid for Undertaking Research / Research Consultation for already commercialized / marketed Ayurveda products. CCRAS research policy is available online at http://www.ccras.nic.in/content/ccras-research- policy.

The core components of the document comprise sustainable development goals (SDGs) of CCRAS for vision 2030 for 15 years, 7 years strategy (long-term vision), and 3 years action document, fundamentally harmonized with the goals and recommendations of major national and international health policy documents. CCRAS has laid its vision document 2030 To develop scientific evidence in Ayurvedic Principles, drug therapies by way of integrating ancient wisdom with modem technology and to bring Ayurveda to the people through innovations related diagnostics, preventive, promotive as well as treatment methods and also introduce scientific research for sustained availability of quality natural resources, to translate them into products and processes and in synergy with concerned organizations to introduce these innovations into public health systems. The National Population Policy 2000, 6 National Health Policy 2002, and the National Commission on Macroeconomic and Health\u20142005 of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, emphasized on reorientation and prioritization of research in Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) and to validate therapy and drugs in chronic and lifestyle-related diseases, mainstreaming from Indian systems of medicine and homoeopathy (ISM&H). Further, the recent three major documents related to health policy, viz., National Health Policy (NHP) 2017; Situation Analyses\u2014Backdrop to NHP 2017, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India; and Three-Year Action Agenda 2017-2020 (draft), 10 NITI Aayog, Government of India, highlighted on prevention through lifestyle advocacy, health care delivery through integration, co-location, and medical pluralism. In the same way, considering the strength of Ayurveda in current unmet medical needs, the council has proposed a strategy of research and development with focused research outcomes in next 15 years emphasizing on development of new drugs based on leads from classical Ayurveda texts for diseases of national importance and systematic validation of classicalVOLUME-I 193 Glimpses of CCRAS contributions - (50 Glorious years) I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I formulations and therapies with a vision statement \"To develop scientific evidence in Ayurvedic Principles, drugs, therapies by way of integrating ancient wisdom with modem technology and to bring Ayurveda to the people through innovations related to diagnostics, preventive, promotive as well as treatment methods and also introduce scientific research for sustained availability of quality natural resources, to translate them into products and processes and in synergy with concerned organizations to introduce these innovations into public health systems.\" Principally analogous with the larger goals and strategies of important health-related policies, core strength of Ayurveda, and current health needs, the document is framed with core components, viz., SDGs of CCRAS for vision 2030 (15 years), 7 years strategy (long-term vision), and 3 years action document. 15 years strategy: SDGs of CCRAS for vision 2030 (15 years) emphasizes on broader goals set for 15 years, such as translation of research outcomes into practice and making them accessible to health care providers and public, mainstreaming of Ayurveda therapies through integration, generation of evidence on safety and efficacy of classical Ayurveda approaches, dissemination of research outcomes, and infrastructure development for research and development. 7-years strategy: From 2017-2018 to 2023-2024 (long-term vision) to convert the long-term vision into implementable policy and action as a part of the National Development Agenda with a mid-term review after 3 years, i.e., the year ending March 2020, focuses on development and validation of Ayurvedic drugs and regimen for inclusion in the important national programs, such as add-on and adjunct therapies for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; generation of evidence for prevention and management of disorders of vision, reproductive and child health, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, non- communicable diseases like diabetes, osteoarthritis, anemia; improvement of memory and cognitive function other psychiatric diseases, such as anxiety neurosis, dementia, etc.; scientific evidence on safety of selected Ayurveda herbo-mineral drugs, etc. 3-years strategy: A 3-years action document from 2017-2018 to 2019-2020 aligned to the predictability of financial resources during the 14th Finance Commission Award period.
