We present to you effective crystal pairings for various purposes. There are factors to consider so that the pairings or combinations do not backfire on you. When you start with combining gemstones, you may become overwhelmed with all of the stats you need to keep in mind. The metaphysical properties of gemstones are complex as can be, and the wrong pairing can lead to less than ideal results. However, crystal pairings are useful for energy practice and fun as you will be building your collection as you go along. Sometimes, you will need to acquire additional gemstones for particular pairings, and aligned stones can be combined with four or even six at a time depending on your needs and temperament. The risk with not knowing the right combinations is you might end up pairing crystals that cancel each other out. There has to be harmony between the glasses that you pick, and they need to complement and not compete with each other. Certain stones are paired best with specific stones. First, think of your desires and what you want to achieve in creating or using a crystal pairing. Focus on that thought so the stones will call to you naturally. Crystals can be combined based on their color, family, and element. Crystals can also be combined based on the intention you have in mind, and by the properties that the gemstones have.
