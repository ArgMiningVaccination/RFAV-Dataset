INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE This chapter describes practice and quality standards for handling hazardous drugs (HDs) to promote patient safety, worker safety, and environmental protection. Handling HDs includes, but is not limited to, the receipt, storage, compounding, dis- pensing, administration, and disposal of sterile and nonsterile products and preparations. This chapter applies to all healthcare personnel who handle HD preparations and all entities that store, prepare, transport, or administer HDs (e.g., pharmacies, hospitals and other healthcare institutions, patient treatment clinics, physicians' practice fa- cilities, or veterinarians' offices). Personnel who may potentially be exposed to HDs include, but are not limited to: pharma- cists, pharmacy technicians, nurses, physicians, physician assistants, home healthcare workers, veterinarians, and veterinary technicians. Entities that handle HDs must incorporate the standards in this chapter into their occupational safety plan. The entity's health and safety management system must, at a minimum, include: A list of HDs Facility and engineering controls Competent personnel Safe work practices Proper use of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Policies for HD waste segregation and disposal The chapter is organized into the following main sections: 1.

LIST OF HAZARDOUS DRUGS The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) maintains a list of antineoplastic and other HDs used in healthcare. An entity must maintain a list of HDs, which must include any items on the current NIOSH list that the entity han- dles. The entity's list must be reviewed at least every 12 months. Whenever a new agent or dosage form is used, it should be reviewed against the entity's list. The NIOSH list of antineoplastic and other HDs provides the criteria used to identify HDs. These criteria must be used to identify HDs that enter the market after the most recent version of the NIOSH list, or that the entity handles as an investiga-Errata to First Supplement to USP 40-NF 35 Physical Tests / \u00e1 800\u00f1 Hazardous Drugs 1 Official from December 1, 2017 Copyright (c) 2017 The United States Pharmacopeial Convention.

If the information available on a drug is deemed insufficient to make an informed decision, consider the drug haz- ardous until more information is available. Box 1: Containment Requirements Drugs on the NIOSH list that must follow the requirements in this chapter include: \u2014 Any HD API \u2014 Any antineoplastic requiring HD manipulation Drugs on the NIOSH list that do not have to follow all the containment requirements of this chapter if an assessment of risk is performed and implemented include: \u2014 Final dosage forms of compounded HD preparations and conventionally manufactured HD products, including antineoplastic dosage forms that do not require any further manipulation other than counting or repackaging (unless required by the manufacturer) For dosage forms of other HDs on the NIOSH list, the entity may perform an assessment of risk to determine alternative containment strategies and/work practices Some dosage forms of drugs defined as hazardous may not pose a significant risk of direct occupational exposure because of their dosage formulation (e.g., tablets or capsules \u2014solid, intact medications that are administered to patients without modify- ing the formulation). However, dust from tablets and capsules may present a risk of exposure by skin contact and/or inhala- tion. An assessment of risk may be performed for these dosage forms to determine alternative containment strategies and/or work practices. If an assessment of risk is not performed, all HDs must be handled with all containment strategies defined in this chapter. The assessment of risk must, at a minimum, consider the following: Type of HD (e.g., antineoplastic, non-antineoplastic, reproductive risk only) Dosage form Risk of exposure Packaging Manipulation If an assessment of risk approach is taken, the entity must document what alternative containment strategies and/or work practices are being employed for specific dosage forms to minimize occupational exposure. If used, the assessment of risk must be reviewed at least every 12 months and the review documented. 3. TYPES OF EXPOSURE Routes of unintentional entry of HDs into the body include dermal and mucosal absorption, inhalation, injection, and inges- tion (e.g., contaminated foodstuffs, spills, or mouth contact with contaminated hands). Containers of HDs have been shown to be contaminated upon receipt. Both clinical and nonclinical personnel may be exposed to HDs when they handle HDs or touch contaminated surfaces. Table 1 lists examples of potential routes of exposure based on activity. Table 1. Examples of Potential Opportunities of Exposure Based on Activity Activity Potential Opportunity of Exposure Receipt Contacting HD residues present on drug containers, individual dosage units, outer containers, work surfaces, or floors Dispensing Counting or repackaging tablets and capsules Compounding and other manipulations Crushing or splitting tablets or opening capsules Pouring oral or topical liquids from one container to another Weighing or mixing components Constituting or reconstituting powdered or lyophilized HDs Withdrawing or diluting injectable parenteral containers Expelling air or HDs from syringes Contacting HD residue present on PPE or other garments Deactivating, decontaminating, cleaning, and disinfecting areas contaminated with or suspected to be contaminated with HDs Maintenance activities for potentially contaminated equipment and devices Administration Generating aerosols during administration of HDs by various routes (e.g., injection, irrigation, oral, inhalation, or topical application) Performing certain specialized procedures (e.g., intraoperative intraperitoneal injection or bladder instillation) Priming an IV administration set Patient-care activities Handling body fluids (e.g., urine, feces, sweat, or vomit) or body-fluid-contaminated clothing, dressings, linens, and other materials Spills Spill generation, management, and disposal Transport Moving HDs within a healthcare setting Waste Collection and disposal of hazardous waste and trace contaminated waste2 \u00e1800\u00f1 Hazardous Drugs / Physical Tests Errata to First Supplement to USP 40-NF 35 Official from December 1, 2017 Copyright (c) 2017 The United States Pharmacopeial Convention.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF PERSONNEL HANDLING HAZARDOUS DRUGS Each entity must have a designated person who is qualified and trained to be responsible for developing and implementing appropriate procedures; overseeing entity compliance with this chapter and other applicable laws, regulations, and standards; ensuring competency of personnel; and ensuring environmental control of the storage and compounding areas. The designa- ted person must thoroughly understand the rationale for risk-prevention policies, risks to themselves and others, risks of non- compliance that may compromise safety, and the responsibility to report potentially hazardous situations to the management team. The designated person must also be responsible for the oversight of monitoring the facility and maintaining reports of testing/sampling performed in facilities, and acting on the results. All personnel who handle HDs are responsible for understanding the fundamental practices and precautions and for continu- ally evaluating these procedures and the quality of final HDs to prevent harm to patients, minimize exposure to personnel, and minimize contamination of the work and patient-care environment. Change to read: 5. FACILITIES AND ENGINEERING CONTROLS HDs must be handled under conditions that promote patient safety, worker safety, and environmental protection. Signs des- ignating the hazard must be prominently displayed before the entrance to the HD handling areas. Access to areas where HDs are handled must be restricted to authorized personnel to protect persons not involved in HD handling. HD handling areas must be located away from breakrooms and refreshment areas for personnel, patients, or visitors to reduce risk of exposure. Designated areas must be available for: Receipt and unpacking Storage of HDs Nonsterile HD compounding (if performed by the entity) Sterile HD compounding (if performed by the entity) Certain areas are required to have negative pressure from surrounding areas to contain HDs and minimize risk of exposure. Consideration should be given to uninterrupted power sources (UPS) for the ventilation systems to maintain negative pressure in the event of power loss. 5.1 Receipt Antineoplastic HDs and all HD APIs must be unpacked (i.e., removal from external shipping containers) in an area that is neutral/normal or negative pressure relative to the surrounding areas. HDs must not be unpacked from their external shipping containers in sterile compounding areas or in positive pressure areas. 5.2 Storage HDs must be stored in a manner that prevents spillage or breakage if the container falls. Do not store HDs on the floor. In areas prone to specific types of natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes) the manner of storage must meet applicable safety precau- tions, such as secure shelves with raised front lips. Antineoplastic HDs requiring manipulation other than counting or repackaging of final dosage forms and any HD API must be stored separately from non-HDs in a manner that prevents contamination and personnel exposure. These HDs must be stor- ed in an externally ventilated, negative-pressure room with at least 12 air changes per hour (ACPH). Non-antineoplastic, repro- ductive risk only, and final dosage forms of antineoplastic HDs may be stored with other inventory if permitted by entity poli- cy. Sterile and nonsterile HDs may be stored together, but HDs used for nonsterile compounding should not be stored in areas designated for sterile compounding to minimize traffic into the sterile compounding area. Refrigerated antineoplastic HDs must be stored in a dedicated refrigerator in a negative pressure area with at least 12 ACPH [e.g., storage room, buffer room, or containment segregated compounding area (C-SCA)]. If a refrigerator is placed in a nega- tive pressure buffer room, an exhaust located adjacent to the refrigerator's compressor and behind the refrigerator should be considered. 5.3 Compounding Engineering controls are required to protect the preparation from cross-contamination and microbial contamination (if prep- aration is intended to be sterile) during all phases of the compounding process. Engineering controls for containment are divi- ded into three categories representing primary, secondary, and supplementary levels of control. A containment primary engi- neering control (C-PEC) is a ventilated device designed to minimize worker and environmental HD exposure when directly handling HDs. The containment secondary engineering control (C-SEC) is the room in which the C-PEC is placed.

Must be downloaded with registration directly from www.usp.orgtal engineering controls [e.g., closed-system drug-transfer device (CSTD)] are adjunct controls to offer additional levels of pro- tection. Appendix 2 provides examples for designs of HD compounding areas. Sterile and nonsterile HDs must be compounded within a C-PEC located in a C-SEC. The C-SEC used for sterile and nonster- ile compounding must: Be externally vented (ERR 1-Jun-2016) Be physically separated (i.e., a different room from other preparation areas) Have an appropriate air exchange (e.g., ACPH) Have a negative pressure between 0.01 and 0.03 inches of water column relative to all adjacent areas The C-PEC must operate continuously if it supplies some or all of the negative pressure in the C-SEC or if it is used for sterile compounding. If there is any loss of power to the C-PEC, or if repair or moving occurs, all activities occurring in the C-PEC must be suspended immediately. If necessary, protect the unit by covering it appropriately per the manufacturer's recommen- dations. Once the C-PEC can be powered on, decontaminate, clean, and disinfect (if used for sterile compounding) all surfaces and wait the manufacturer-specified recovery time before resuming compounding. A sink must be available for hand washing. An eyewash station and/or other emergency or safety precautions that meet ap- plicable laws and regulations must be readily available. Care must be taken to locate water sources and drains in areas where their presence will not interfere with required ISO classifications. Water sources and drains must be located at least 1 meter away from the C-PEC. For entities that compound both nonsterile and sterile HDs, the respective C-PECs must be placed in separate rooms, unless those C-PECs used for nonsterile compounding are sufficiently effective that the room can continuously maintain ISO 7 classifi- cation throughout the nonsterile compounding activity. If the C-PECs used for sterile and nonsterile compounding are placed in the same room, they must be placed at least 1 meter apart and particle-generating activity must not be performed when sterile compounding is in process. 5.3.1 NONSTERILE COMPOUNDING In addition to this chapter, nonsterile compounding must follow standards in Pharmaceutical Compounding \u2014Nonsterile Prep- arations \u00e1795\u00f1. A C-PEC is not required if manipulations are limited to handling of final dosage forms (e.g., counting or repack- aging of tablets and capsules) that do not produce particles, aerosols, or gasses. The C-PECs used for manipulation of nonsterile HDs must be either externally vented (preferred) or have redundant-HEPA filters in series. Nonsterile HD compounding must be performed in a C-PEC that provides personnel and environmental protec- tion, such as a Class I Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) or Containment Ventilated Enclosure (CVE). A Class II BSC or a com- pounding aseptic containment isolator (CACI) may also be used. For occasional nonsterile HD compounding, a C-PEC used for sterile compounding (e.g., Class II BSC or CACI) may be used but must be decontaminated, cleaned, and disinfected before resuming sterile compounding in that C-PEC. A C-PEC used only for nonsterile compounding does not require unidirectional airflow because the critical environment does not need to be ISO classified. The C-PEC must be placed in a C-SEC that has at least 12 ACPH. Table 2 summarizes the engineering controls required for nonsterile HD compounding. Due to the difficulty of cleaning HD contamination, surfaces of ceilings, walls, floors, fixtures, shelving, counters, and cabi- nets in the nonsterile compounding area must be smooth, impervious, free from cracks and crevices, and non-shedding. Table 2. Engineering Controls for Nonsterile HD Compounding C-PEC C-SEC Requirements Externally vented (preferred) or redundant-HEPA filtered in series Examples: CVE, Class I or II BSC, CACI Externally vented 12 ACPH Negative pressure between 0.01 and 0.03 inches of water column relative to adjacent areas 5.3.2 STERILE COMPOUNDING In addition to this chapter, sterile compounding must follow standards in \u00e1797\u00f1. All C-PECs used for manipulation of sterile HDs must be externally vented. Sterile HD compounding must be performed in a C-PEC that provides an ISO Class 5 or better air quality, such as a Class II or III BSC or CACI. Class II BSC types A2, B1, or B2 are acceptable. For most known HDs, type A2 cabinets offer a simple and reliable integration with the ventilation and pressuri- zation requirements of the C-SEC. Class II type B2 BSCs are typically reserved for use with volatile components. Appendix 3 describes the different types of BSCs. A laminar airflow workbench (LAFW) or compounding aseptic isolator (CAI) must not be used for the compounding of an antineoplastic HD. A BSC or CACI used for the preparation of HDs must not be used for the preparation of a non-HD unless the non-HD preparation is placed into a protective outer wrapper during removal from the C-PEC and is labeled to require PPE handling precautions. The C-PEC must be located in a C-SEC, which may either be an ISO Class 7 buffer room with an ISO Class 7 ante-room (preferred) or an unclassified containment segregated compounding area (C-SCA). If the C-PEC is placed in a C-SCA, the be- yond-use date (BUD) of all compounded sterile preparations (CSPs) prepared must be limited as described in \u00e1797\u00f1 for CSPs4 \u00e1800\u00f1 Hazardous Drugs / Physical Tests Errata to First Supplement to USP 40-NF 35 Official from December 1, 2017 Copyright (c) 2017 The United States Pharmacopeial Convention.

Engineering Controls for Sterile HD Compounding Configuration C-PEC C-SEC Maximum BUD ISO Class 7 buffer room with an ISO Class 7 ante-room Externally vented Examples: Class II BSC or CACI Externally vented 30 ACPH Negative pressure between 0.01 and 0.03 inches of water column relative toadjacent areas As described in \u00e1797\u00f1 Unclassified C-SCA Externally vented Examples: Class II BSC or CACI Externally vented 12 ACPH Negative pressure between 0.01 and 0.03 inches ofwater column relative toadjacent areasAs described in \u00e1797\u00f1 for CSPs prepared in a segregated compounding area ISO Class 7 buffer room with an ISO class 7 ante-room: The C-PEC is placed in an ISO Class 7 buffer room that has fixed walls, HEPA-filtered supply air, a negative pressure between 0.01 and 0.03 inches of water column relative to all adjacent areas and a minimum of 30 ACPH. The buffer room must be externally vented. Because the room through which entry into the HD buffer room (e.g., ante- room or non-HD buffer room) plays an important role in terms of total contamination control, the following is required: Minimum of 30 ACPH of HEPA-filtered supply air Maintain a positive pressure of at least 0.02 inches of water column relative to all adjacent unclassified areas Maintain an air quality of ISO Class 7 or better An ISO Class 7 ante-room with fixed walls is necessary to provide inward air migration of equal cleanliness classified air into the negative pressure buffer room to contain any airborne HD. A hand-washing sink must be placed in the ante-room at least 1 meter from the entrance to the HD buffer room to avoid contamination migration into the negative pressure HD buffer room. Although not a recommended facility design, if the negative-pressure HD buffer room is entered though the positive-pres- sure non-HD buffer room, the following is also required: A line of demarcation must be defined within the negative-pressure buffer room for donning and doffing PPE A method to transport HDs, HD CSPs, and HD waste into and out of the negative pressure buffer room to minimize the spread of HD contamination. This may be accomplished by use of a pass-through chamber between the negative-pres- sure buffer area and adjacent space. The pass-through chamber must be included in the facility's certification to ensure that particles are not compromising the air quality of the negative-pressure buffer room. A refrigerator pass-through must not be used. Other methods of containment (such as sealed containers) may be used. HD CSPs prepared in an ISO Class 7 buffer room with an ISO Class 7 ante-room may use the BUDs described in \u00e1797\u00f1, based on the categories of CSP, sterility testing, and storage temperature. Containment segregated compounding area (C-SCA): The C-PEC is placed in an unclassified C-SCA that has fixed walls, a negative pressure between 0.01 and 0.03 inches of water column relative to all adjacent areas, and a minimum of 12 ACPH. The C-SCA must be externally vented. A hand-washing sink must be placed at least 1 meter from C-PEC and may be either inside the C-SCA or directly outside the C-SCA. Only low- and medium-risk HD CSPs may be prepared in a C-SCA. HD CSPs prepared in the C-SCA must not exceed the BUDs described in \u00e1797\u00f1 for CSPs prepared in a segregated compounding area. 5.4 Containment Supplemental Engineering Controls Containment supplemental engineering controls, such as CSTDs, provide adjunct controls to offer an additional level of pro- tection during compounding or administration. Some CSTDs have been shown to limit the potential of generating aerosols during compounding. However, there is no certainty that all CSTDs will perform adequately. Until a published universal per- formance standard for evaluation of CSTD containment is available, users should carefully evaluate the performance claims as- sociated with available CSTDs based on independent, peer-reviewed studies and demonstrated containment reduction. A CSTD must not be used as a substitute for a C-PEC when compounding. CSTDs should be used when compounding HDs when the dosage form allows. CSTDs must be used when administering antineoplastic HDs when the dosage form allows. CSTDs known to be physically or chemically incompatible with a specific HD must not be used for that HD. 6. ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND CONTROL Environmental wipe sampling for HD surface residue should be performed routinely (e.g., initially as a benchmark and at least every 6 months, or more often as needed, to verify containment). Surface wipe sampling should include: Interior of the C-PEC and equipment contained in itErrata to First Supplement to USP 40-NF 35 Physical Tests / \u00e1800\u00f1 Hazardous Drugs 5 Official from December 1, 2017 Copyright (c) 2017 The United States Pharmacopeial Convention.

Must be downloaded with registration directly from www.usp.org Pass-through chambers Surfaces in staging or work areas near the C-PEC Areas adjacent to C-PECs (e.g., floors directly under C-PEC, staging, and dispensing area) Areas immediately outside the HD buffer room or the C-SCA Patient administration areas There are currently no studies demonstrating the effectiveness of a specific number or size of wipe samples in determining levels of HD contamination. Wipe sampling kits should be verified before use to ensure the method and reagent used have been tested to recover a specific percentage of known marker drugs from various surface types found in the sampled area. There are currently no certifying agencies for vendors of wipe sample kits. There is currently no standard for acceptable limits for HD surface contamination. Common marker HDs that can be assayed include cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, and platinum-containing drugs. An example of measurable contamination would be cyclophosphamide levels >1.00 ng/cm2, which were shown in some studies to result in uptake of the drug in exposed workers. If any measurable contamination is found, the designated person must identify, document, and con- tain the cause of contamination. Such action may include reevaluating work practices, re-training personnel, performing thor- ough deactivation, decontamination, cleaning, and improving engineering controls. Repeat the wipe sampling to validate that the deactivation/decontamination and cleaning steps have been effective. 7. PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) provides worker protection to reduce exposure to HD aerosols and residues. Additional PPE may be required to handle the HDs outside of a C-PEC, such as treating a patient or cleaning a spill. The NIOSH list of antineoplastic and other HDs provides general guidance on PPE for possible scenarios that may be encountered in healthcare settings. Disposable PPE must not be re-used. Reusable PPE must be decontaminated and cleaned after use. Gowns, head, hair, shoe covers, and two pairs of chemotherapy gloves are required for compounding sterile and nonsterile HDs. Two pairs of chemotherapy gloves are required for administering antineoplastic HDs. Gowns shown to resist permeability by HDs are required when administering injectable antineoplastic HDs. For all other activities, the entity's SOP must describe the appropriate PPE to be worn based on its occupational safety plan and assessment of risk (if used). The entity must develop SOPs for PPE based on the risk of exposure (see Types of Exposure) and activities performed. Appropriate PPE must be worn when handling HDs including during: Receipt Storage Transport Compounding (sterile and nonsterile) Administration Deactivation/decontamination, cleaning, and disinfecting Spill control Waste disposal 7.1 Gloves When chemotherapy gloves are required, they must meet American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard D6978 (or its successor). Chemotherapy gloves should be worn for handling all HDs including non-antineoplastics and for re- productive risk only HDs. Chemotherapy gloves must be powder-free because powder can contaminate the work area and can adsorb and retain HDs. Gloves must be inspected for physical defects before use. Do not use gloves with pin holes or weak spots. When used for sterile compounding, the outer chemotherapy gloves must be sterile. Chemotherapy gloves should be changed every 30 minutes unless otherwise recommended by the manufacturer's documentation and must be changed when torn, punctured, or contaminated. Hands must be washed with soap and water after removing gloves. 7.2 Gowns When gowns are required, they must be disposable and shown to resist permeability by HDs. Gowns must be selected based on the HDs handled. Disposable gowns made of polyethylene-coated polypropylene or other laminate materials offer better protection than those made of uncoated materials. Gowns must close in the back (i.e., no open front), be long sleeved, and have closed cuffs that are elastic or knit. Gowns must not have seams or closures that could allow HDs to pass through. Cloth laboratory coats, surgical scrubs, isolation gowns, or other absorbent materials are not appropriate protective outer- wear when handling HDs because they permit the permeation of HDs and can hold spilled drugs against the skin, thereby increasing exposure. Clothing may also retain HD residue from contact, and may transfer to other healthcare workers or vari- ous surfaces. Washing of non-disposable clothing contaminated with HD residue should only be done according to facility pol-6 \u00e1800\u00f1 Hazardous Drugs / Physical Tests Errata to First Supplement to USP 40-NF 35 Official from December 1, 2017 Copyright (c) 2017 The United States Pharmacopeial Convention.

Must be downloaded with registration directly from www.usp.orgicy as drug residue may be transferred to other clothing. Potentially contaminated clothing must not be taken home under any circumstances. Gowns must be changed per the manufacturer's information for permeation of the gown. If no permeation information is available for the gowns used, change them every 2-3 hours or immediately after a spill or splash. Gowns worn in HD handling areas must not be worn to other areas in order to avoid spreading HD contamination and exposing other healthcare workers. 7.3 Head, Hair, Shoe, and Sleeve Covers Head and hair covers (including beard and moustache, if applicable), shoe covers, and sleeve covers provide protection from contact with HD residue. When compounding HDs, a second pair of shoe covers must be donned before entering the C-SEC and doffed when exiting the C-SEC. Shoe covers worn in HD handling areas must not be worn to other areas to avoid spread- ing HD contamination and exposing other healthcare workers. Disposable sleeve covers may be used to protect areas of the arm that may come in contact with HDs. Disposable sleeve covers made of polyethylene-coated polypropylene or other laminate materials offer better protection than those made of un- coated materials. 7.4 Eye and Face Protection Many HDs are irritating to the eyes and mucous membranes. Appropriate eye and face protection must be worn when there is a risk for spills or splashes of HDs or HD waste materials when working outside of a C-PEC (e.g., administration in the surgi- cal suite, working at or above eye level, or cleaning a spill). A full-facepiece respirator provides eye and face protection. Gog- gles must be used when eye protection is needed. Eye glasses alone or safety glasses with side shields do not protect the eyes adequately from splashes. Face shields in combination with goggles provide a full range of protection against splashes to the face and eyes. Face shields alone do not provide full eye and face protection. 7.5 Respiratory Protection Personnel who are unpacking HDs that are not contained in plastic should wear an elastomeric half-mask with a multi-gas cartridge and P100-filter until assessment of the packaging integrity can be made to ensure no breakage or spillage occurred during transport. If the type of drug can be better defined, a more targeted cartridge can be used. Surgical masks do not provide respiratory protection from drug exposure and must not be used when respiratory protection from HD exposure is required. A surgical N95 respirator provides the respiratory protection of an N95 respirator, and like a surgical mask, provides a barrier to splashes, droplets, and sprays around the nose and mouth. For most activities requiring respiratory protection, a fit-tested NIOSH-certified N95 or more protective respirator is sufficient to protect against airborne particles. However, N95 respirators offer no protection against gases and vapors and little protec- tion against direct liquid splashes (see the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Respirator Trusted-Source In- formation). Fit test the respirator and train workers to use respiratory protection. Follow all requirements in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) respiratory protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134). An appropriate full-facepiece, chemical car- tridge-type respirator or powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) should be worn when there is a risk of respiratory exposure to HDs, including when: Attending to HD spills larger than what can be contained with a spill kit Deactivating, decontaminating, and cleaning underneath the work surface of a C-PEC There is a known or suspected airborne exposure to powders or vapors 7.6 Disposal of Used Personal Protective Equipment Consider all PPE worn when handling HDs to be contaminated with, at minimum, trace quantities of HDs. PPE must be placed in an appropriate waste container and further disposed of per local, state, and federal regulations. PPE worn during compounding should be disposed of in the proper waste container before leaving the C-SEC. Chemotherapy gloves and sleeve covers (if used) worn during compounding must be carefully removed and discarded immediately into a waste container ap- proved for trace contaminated waste inside the C-PEC or contained in a sealable bag for discarding outside the C-PEC. 8. HAZARD COMMUNICATION PROGRAM Entities are required to establish policies and procedures that ensure worker safety during all aspects of HD handling. The entity must develop SOPs to ensure effective training regarding proper labeling, transport, storage, and disposal of the HDs and use of Safety Data Sheets (SDS), based on the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS). Elements of the hazard communication program plan must include:Errata to First Supplement to USP 40-NF 35 Physical Tests / \u00e1800\u00f1 Hazardous Drugs 7 Official from December 1, 2017 Copyright (c) 2017 The United States Pharmacopeial Convention.

PERSONNEL TRAINING All personnel who handle HDs must be trained based on their job functions (e.g., in the receipt, storage, compounding, repackaging, dispensing, administrating, and disposing of HDs). Training must occur before the employee independently han- dles HDs. The effectiveness of training for HD handling competencies must be demonstrated by each employee. Personnel competency must be reassessed at least every 12 months. Personnel must be trained prior to the introduction of a new HD or new equipment and prior to a new or significant change in process or SOP. All training and competency assessment must be documented. The training must include at least the following: Overview of entity's list of HDs and their risks Review of the entity's SOPs related to handling of HDs Proper use of PPE Proper use of equipment and devices (e.g., engineering controls) Response to known or suspected HD exposure Spill management Proper disposal of HDs and trace-contaminated materials 10. RECEIVING The entity must establish SOPs for receiving HDs. HDs should be received from the supplier in impervious plastic to segre- gate them from other drugs and to allow for safety in the receiving and internal transfer process. HDs must be delivered to the HD storage area immediately after unpacking. PPE, including chemotherapy gloves, must be worn when unpacking HDs (see Personal Protective Equipment). A spill kit must be accessible in the receiving area. The entity must enforce policies that include a tiered approach, starting with visual examination of the shipping container for signs of damage or breakage (e.g., visible stains from leakage, sounds of broken glass). Table 4 summarizes the steps for receiving and handling of damaged shipping containers. Table 4. Summary of Requirements for Receiving and Handling Damaged HD Shipping Containers If the shipping container appears damaged Seal container without opening and contact the supplier If the unopened package is to be returned to the supplier, enclose the package in an impervious container and label the outer container \"Hazardous\" If the supplier declines return, dispose of as hazardous waste If a damaged shipping container must be opened Seal the container in plastic or an impervious container Transport it to a C-PEC and place on a plastic-backed preparation mat Open the package and remove undamaged items Wipe the outside of the undamaged items with a disposable wipe Enclose the damaged item(s) in an impervious container and label the outer container \"Hazardous\" If the supplier declines return, dispose of as hazardous waste Deactivate, decontaminate, and clean the C-PEC (see Deactivating, Decontaminating, Cleaning, and Disinfecting) and discard the mat and cleaning disposables as hazardous waste When opening damaged shipping containers, they should preferably be transported to a C-PEC designated for nonsterile compounding. If a C-PEC designated for sterile compounding is the only one available, it must be disinfected after the decon- tamination, deactivation, and cleaning step before returning to any sterile compounding activity. Damaged packages or shipping cartons must be considered spills that must be reported to the designated person and man- aged according to the entity's SOPs. Segregate HDs waiting to be returned to the supplier in a designated negative pressure area. Clean-up must comply with established SOPs. 11. LABELING, PACKAGING, TRANSPORT AND DISPOSAL The entity must establish SOPs for the labeling, packaging, transport, and disposal of HDs. The SOPs must address preven- tion of accidental exposures or spills, personnel training on response to exposure, and use of a spill kit.

Personnel must ensure that the labeling processes for compounded preparations do not introduce contamination into the non-HD handling areas. 11.2 Packaging Personnel must select and use packaging containers and materials that will maintain physical integrity, stability, and sterility (if needed) of the HDs during transport. Packaging materials must protect the HD from damage, leakage, contamination, and degradation, while protecting healthcare workers who transport HDs. The entity must have written SOPs to describe appropri- ate shipping containers and insulating materials, based on information from product specifications, vendors, and mode of transport. 11.3 Transport HDs that need to be transported must be labeled, stored, and handled in accordance with applicable federal, state, and lo- cal regulations. HDs must be transported in containers that minimize the risk of breakage or leakage. Pneumatic tubes must not be used to transport any liquid HDs or any antineoplastic HDs because of the potential for breakage and contamination. When shipping HDs to locations outside the entity, the entity must consult the Transport Information on the SDS. The entity must ensure that labels and accessory labeling for the HDs include storage instructions, disposal instructions, and HD category information in a format that is consistent with the carrier's policies. 11.4 Disposal All personnel who perform routine custodial waste removal and cleaning activities in HD handling areas must be trained in appropriate procedures to protect themselves and the environment to prevent HD contamination. Disposal of all HD waste, including, but not limited to, unused HDs and trace-contaminated PPE and other materials, must comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations. 12. DISPENSING FINAL DOSAGE FORMS HDs that do not require any further manipulation, other than counting or repackaging of final dosage forms, may be pre- pared for dispensing without any further requirements for containment unless required by the manufacturer or if visual indica- tors of HD exposure hazards are present (e.g., HD dust or leakage). Counting or repackaging of HDs must be done carefully. Clean equipment should be dedicated for use with HDs and should be decontaminated after every use. Tablet and capsule forms of antineoplastic HDs must not be placed in automated counting or packaging machines, which subject them to stress and may create powdered contaminants. 13. COMPOUNDING Entities and personnel involved in compounding HDs must be compliant with the appropriate USP standards for compound- ing including \u00e1795\u00f1 and \u00e1797\u00f1. Compounding must be done in proper engineering controls as described in Compounding. When compounding HD preparations in a C-PEC, a plastic-backed preparation mat should be placed on the work surface of the C-PEC. The mat should be changed immediately if a spill occurs and regularly during use, and should be discarded at the end of the daily compounding activity. Disposable or clean equipment for compounding (such as mortars and pestles, and spatulas) must be dedicated for use with HDs. Bulk containers of liquid and API HD must be handled carefully to avoid spills. If used, APIs or other powdered HDs must be handled in a C-PEC to protect against occupational exposure, especially during particle-generating activities (such as crushing tablets, opening capsules, and weighing powder). 14. ADMINISTERING HDs must be administered safely using protective medical devices and techniques. Examples of protective medical devices include needleless and closed systems. Examples of protective techniques include spiking or priming of IV tubing with a non- HD solution in a C-PEC and crushing tablets in a plastic pouch.Errata to First Supplement to USP 40-NF 35 Physical Tests / \u00e1800\u00f1 Hazardous Drugs 9 Official from December 1, 2017 Copyright (c) 2017 The United States Pharmacopeial Convention.

Must be downloaded with registration directly from www.usp.orgAppropriate PPE must be worn when administering HDs. After use, PPE must be removed and disposed of in a waste con- tainer approved for trace-contaminated HD waste at the site of drug administration. Equipment (such as tubing and needles) and packaging materials must be disposed of properly, such as in HD waste containers, after administration. CSTDs must be used for administration of antineoplastic HDs when the dosage form allows. Techniques and ancillary devi- ces that minimize the risk posed by open systems must be used when administering HDs through certain routes. Administra- tion into certain organs or body cavities (e.g., the bladder, eye, peritoneal cavity, or chest cavity) often requires equipment for which locking connections may not be readily available or possible. Healthcare personnel should avoid manipulating HDs such as crushing tablets or opening capsules if possible. Liquid formu- lations are preferred if solid oral dosage forms are not appropriate for the patient. If HD dosage forms do require manipulation such as crushing tablet(s) or opening capsule(s) for a single dose, personnel must don appropriate PPE and use a plastic pouch to contain any dust or particles generated. 15. DEACTIVATING, DECONTAMINATING, CLEANING, AND DISINFECTING All areas where HDs are handled and all reusable equipment and devices must be deactivated, decontaminated, and cleaned. Additionally, sterile compounding areas and devices must be subsequently disinfected. The entity must establish written procedures for decontamination, deactivation, and cleaning, and for sterile compounding areas disinfection. Additionally, cleaning of nonsterile compounding areas must comply with \u00e1795\u00f1 and cleaning of sterile com- pounding areas must comply with \u00e1797\u00f1. Written procedures for cleaning must include procedures, agents used, dilutions (if used), frequency, and documentation requirements. All personnel who perform deactivation, decontamination, cleaning, and disinfection activities in HD handling areas must be trained in appropriate procedures to protect themselves and the environment from contamination. All personnel performing these activities must wear appropriate PPE resistant to the cleaning agents used, including two pairs of chemotherapy gloves and impermeable disposable gowns (see Personal Protective Equipment). Additionally, eye protection and face shields must be used if splashing is likely. If warranted by the activity, respiratory protection must be used. The deactivating, decontaminating, cleaning, and disinfecting agents selected must be appropriate for the type of HD con- taminant(s), location, and surface materials. The products used must be compatible with the surface material. Consult manu- facturer or supplier information for compatibility with cleaning agents used. Agents used for deactivation, decontamination, and cleaning should be applied through the use of wipes wetted with appropriate solution and not delivered by a spray bottle to avoid spreading HD residue. All disposable materials must be discarded to meet EPA regulations and the entity's policies. Perform cleaning in areas that are sufficiently ventilated. Table 5 summarizes the purpose and example agents for each step. Table 5. Cleaning Steps Cleaning Step Purpose Example Agents Deactivation Render compound inert or inactiveAs listed in the HD labeling or other agents which may incorporate Environmental Protec- tion Agency (EPA)-registered oxidizers (e.g., peroxide formulations, sodium hypochlorite, etc.) Decontamination Remove HD residueMaterials that have been validated to be effec- tive for HD decontamination, or through other materials proven to be effective through test- ing, which may include alcohol, water, peroxide, or sodium hypochlorite Cleaning Remove organic and inorganic material Germicidal detergent Disinfection (for sterile manipulations) Destroy microorganismsEPA-registered disinfectant and/or sterile alcohol as appropriate for use 15.1 Deactivation Deactivation renders a compound inert or inactive. Residue from deactivation must be removed by decontaminating the surface. There is no one proven method for deactivating all compounds. The ultimate goal should be complete surface decontami- nation. Products that have known deactivation properties (EPA-registered oxidizing agents that are appropriate for the inten- ded use) should be used when possible. Care should be taken when selecting materials for deactivation due to potential ad- verse effects (hazardous byproducts, respiratory effects, and caustic damage to surfaces). Damage to surfaces is exhibited by corrosion to stainless steel surfaces caused by sodium hypochlorite if left untreated. To prevent corrosion, sodium hypochlorite must be neutralized with sodium thiosulfate or by following with an agent to remove the sodium hypochlorite (e.g., sterile alcohol, sterile water, germicidal detergent, or sporicidal agent).10 \u00e1800\u00f1 Hazardous Drugs / Physical Tests Errata to First Supplement to USP 40-NF 35 Official from December 1, 2017 Copyright (c) 2017 The United States Pharmacopeial Convention.

Must be downloaded with registration directly from www.usp.org15.2 Decontamination Decontamination occurs by inactivating, neutralizing, or physically removing HD residue from non-disposable surfaces and transferring it to absorbent, disposable materials (e.g., wipes, pads, or towels) appropriate to the area being cleaned. When choosing among various products available for decontaminating HDs, consideration should be given to surface compatibility and facility requirements. It is imperative to adhere to manufacturer's use instructions. Because of the growing number of as- says available for HDs, additional surface wipe sampling is now possible and should be done to document the effectiveness of any agent used for decontamination of HD residue from work surfaces (see Environmental Quality and Control). The amount of HD contamination introduced into the C-PEC may be reduced by wiping down HD containers. The solution used for wiping HD packaging must not alter the product label. The work surface of the C-PEC must be decontaminated be- tween compounding of different HDs. The C-PEC must be decontaminated at least daily (when used), any time a spill occurs, before and after certification, any time voluntary interruption occurs, and if the ventilation tool is moved. C-PECs may have areas under the work tray where contamination can build up. These areas must be deactivated, decon- taminated, and cleaned at least monthly to reduce the contamination level in the C-PEC. Accessing this area may be difficult. Deactivate, decontaminate, and clean as much as possible of the C-PEC surfaces before accessing the area under the work tray. When deactivating, decontaminating, and cleaning the area under the work tray of a C-PEC, the containment airflows are compromised by opening the cabinets. To provide protection to the worker performing this task, respiratory protection may be required. 15.3 Cleaning Cleaning is a process that results in the removal of contaminants (e.g., soil, microbial contamination, HD residue) from ob- jects and surfaces using water, detergents, surfactants, solvents, and/or other chemicals. Cleaning agents used on compound- ing equipment should not introduce microbial contamination. No cleaning step may be performed when compounding activi- ties are occurring. 15.4 Disinfection Disinfection is a process of inhibiting or destroying microorganisms. Before disinfection can be adequately performed, surfa- ces must be cleaned. Disinfection must be done for areas intended to be sterile, including the sterile compounding areas. 16. SPILL CONTROL All personnel who may be required to clean up a spill of HDs must receive proper training in spill management and the use of PPE and NIOSH-certified respirators (see Personal Protective Equipment). Spills must be contained and cleaned immediately only by qualified personnel with appropriate PPE. Qualified personnel must be available at all times while HDs are being han- dled. Signs must be available for restricting access to the spill area. Spill kits containing all of the materials needed to clean HD spills must be readily available in all areas where HDs are routinely handled. If HDs are being prepared or administered in a non-routine healthcare area, a spill kit and respirator must be available. All spill materials must be disposed of as hazardous waste. The circumstances and management of spills must be documented. Personnel who are potentially exposed during the spill or spill clean up or who have direct skin or eye contact with HDs require immediate evaluation. Non-employees exposed to an HD spill should follow entity policy, which may include reporting to the designated emergency service for initial evaluation and completion of an incident report or exposure form. SOPs must be developed to prevent spills and to direct the clean up of HD spills. SOPs must address the size and scope of the spill and specify who is responsible for spill management and the type of PPE required. The management of the spill (e.g., decontamination, deactivation, and cleaning) may be dependent on the size and type of spill. The SOP must address the loca- tion of spill kits and clean-up materials as well as the capacity of the spill kit. Written procedures should address use of appro- priate full-facepiece, chemical cartridge-type respirators if the capacity of the spill kit is exceeded or if there is known or sus- pected airborne exposure to vapors or gases. 17. DOCUMENTATION AND STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES The entity must maintain SOPs for the safe handling of HDs for all situations in which these HDs are used throughout a facili- ty. The SOPs must be reviewed at least every 12 months by the designated person, and the review must be documented. Revi- sions in forms or records must be made as needed and communicated to all personnel handling HDs. The SOPs for handling of HDs should include: Hazard communication program Occupational safety program Designation of HD areasErrata to First Supplement to USP 40-NF 35 Physical Tests / \u00e1800\u00f1 Hazardous Drugs 11 Official from December 1, 2017 Copyright (c) 2017 The United States Pharmacopeial Convention.

MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE Medical surveillance is part of a comprehensive exposure control program complementing engineering controls, safe work processes, and use of PPE. Healthcare workers who handle HDs as a regular part of their job assignment should be enrolled in a medical surveillance program. The general purpose of surveillance is to minimize adverse health effects in personnel potentially exposed to HDs. Medical surveillance programs involve assessment and documentation of symptom complaints, physical find- ings, and laboratory values (such as a blood count) to determine whether there is a deviation from the expected norms. Medical surveillance can also be viewed as a secondary prevention tool that may provide a means of early detection if a health problem develops. Tracking personnel through medical surveillance allows the comparison of health variables over time in individual workers, which may facilitate early detection of a change in a laboratory value or health condition. Medical sur- veillance programs also look for trends in populations of workers. Examining grouped data compared with data from unex- posed workers may reveal a small alteration or increase in the frequency of a health effect that would be obscured if individual workers' results alone were considered. Medical surveillance evaluates the protection afforded by engineering controls, other administrative controls, safe work pro- cesses, PPE, and worker education about the hazards of the materials they work with in the course of their duties. The data- gathering elements of a medical surveillance program are used to establish a baseline of workers' health and then to monitor their future health for any changes that may result from exposure to HDs. Elements of a medical surveillance program should be consistent with the entity's Human Resource policies and should in- clude: Development of an organized approach to identify workers who are potentially exposed to HDs on the basis of their job duties Use of an entity-based or contracted employee health service to perform the medical surveillance while protecting the confidentiality of the employees' personal medical information Initial baseline assessment (pre-placement) of a worker's health status and medical history. Data elements collected in- clude a medical (including reproductive) history and work history to assess exposure to HDs, physical examination, and laboratory testing. Methods used to assess exposure history include a review of: \u2014 Records of HDs handled, with quantities and dosage forms \u2014 Estimated number of HDs handled per week \u2014 Estimates of hours spent handling HDs per week and/or per month \u2014 Performance of a physical assessment and laboratory studies linked to target organs of commonly used HDs, such as a baseline complete blood count. Biological monitoring to determine blood or urine levels of specific HDs is not cur- rently recommended in surveillance protocols, but may have a role in the follow-up of acute spills with a specificagent. Medical records of surveillance should be maintained according to OSHA regulation concerning access to employee expo- sure and medical records Monitoring workers' health prospectively through periodic surveillance using the elements of data gathering described above (updated health and exposure history, physical assessment, and laboratory measures, if appropriate) Monitoring of the data to identify prevention failure leading to health effects; this monitoring may occur in collaboration with the employee health service Development of a follow-up plan for workers who have shown health changes suggesting toxicity or who have experi- enced an acute exposure. This follow-up should include evaluation of current engineering and administrative controls and equipment to ensure that all systems are appropriately and accurately implemented (see Follow-Up Plan) Completion of an exit examination when a worker's employment at the entity ends, to document the information on the employee's medical, reproductive, and exposure histories. Examination and laboratory evaluation should be guided bythe individual's history of exposures and follow the outline of the periodic evaluation12 \u00e1800\u00f1 Hazardous Drugs / Physical Tests Errata to First Supplement to USP 40-NF 35 Official from December 1, 2017 Copyright (c) 2017 The United States Pharmacopeial Convention.

Must be downloaded with registration directly from www.usp.org18.1 Follow-Up Plan The occurrence of exposure-related health changes should prompt immediate re-evaluation of primary preventive measures (e.g., administrative and engineering controls, PPE, and others). In this manner, medical surveillance acts as a check on the effectiveness of controls already in use. The entity should take the following actions: Perform a post-exposure examination tailored to the type of exposure (e.g., spills or needle sticks from syringes contain- ing HDs). An assessment of the extent of exposure should be conducted and included in a confidential database and in an incident report. The physical examination should focus on the involved area as well as other organ systems commonly affected (i.e., the skin and mucous membranes for direct contact or inhalation; the pulmonary system for aerosolized HDs). Treatment and laboratory studies will follow as indicated and be guided by emergency protocols Compare performance of controls with recommended standards; conduct environmental sampling when analytical meth- ods are available Verify and document that all engineering controls are in proper operating condition Verify and document that the worker complied with existing policies. Review policies for the use of PPE and employee compliance with PPE use and policies. Review availability of appropriate PPE (see Personal Protective Equipment) Develop and document a plan of action that will prevent additional exposure of workers Ensure confidential, two-way communication between the worker and the employee health unit(s) regarding notification, discussions about a change in health condition, or detection of an adverse health effect Provide and document a follow-up medical survey to demonstrate that the plan implemented is effective Ensure that any exposed worker receives confidential notification of any adverse health effect.

A minimum velocity of 75 linear feet/minute of unfiltered room air is drawn through the front opening and across the work surface, providing personnel protection. The air is then passed through a HEPA/ULPA (ultra-low particulate air) filter, either into the room or to the outside in the exhaust plenum, providing environmental protection. Class II: Class II (Types A1, A2, B1, and B2) BSCs are partial barrier systems that rely on the movement of air to provide personnel, environmental, and product/preparation protection. Personnel and product/preparation protection are provi- ded by the combination of inward and downward airflow captured by the front grille of the cabinet. Side-to-side cross- contamination of products/preparations is minimized by the internal downward flow of HEPA/ULPA filtered air moving toward the work surface and then drawn into the front and rear intake grilles. Environmental protection is provided when the cabinet exhaust air is passed through a HEPA/ULPA filter. Type A1 (formerly, Type A): These Class II BSCs maintain a minimum inflow velocity of 75 feet/minute; have HEPA- filtered, down-flow air that is a portion of the mixed down-flow and inflow air from a common plenum; may exhaust HEPA-filtered air back into the laboratory or to the environment through an exhaust canopy; and may have positive- pressure contaminated ducts and plenums that are not surrounded by negative-pressure plenums. Type A1 BSCs are not suitable for use with volatile toxic chemicals and volatile radionuclides.(ERR 1-Oct-2016) Type A2 (formerly, Type B3): These Class II BSCs maintain a minimum inflow velocity of 100 feet/minute; have HEPA-filtered, down-flow air that is a portion of the mixed down-flow and inflow air from a common exhaust ple- num; may exhaust HEPA-filtered air back into the laboratory or to the environment through an exhaust canopy; and have all contaminated ducts and plenums under negative pressure or surrounded by negative-pressure ducts and plenums. If these cabinets are used for minute quantities of volatile toxic chemicals and trace amounts of radionu- clides,(ERR 1-Oct-2016) they must be exhausted through properly functioning exhaust canopies. Type B1: These Class II BSCs maintain a minimum inflow velocity of 100 feet/minute; have HEPA-filtered, down-flow air composed largely of uncontaminated, recirculated inflow air; exhaust most of the contaminated down-flow air through a dedicated duct exhausted to the atmosphere after passing it through a HEPA filter; and have all contami- nated ducts and plenums under negative pressure or surrounded by negative-pressure ducts and plenums. If these cabinets are used for work involving minute quantities of volatile toxic chemicals and trace amounts of radionu- clides,(ERR 1-Oct-2016) the work must be done in the directly exhausted portion of the cabinet. Type B2 (total exhaust): These Class II BSCs maintain a minimum inflow velocity of 100 feet/minute; have HEPA- filtered, down-flow air drawn from the laboratory or the outside; exhaust all inflow and down-flow air to the atmos- phere after filtration through a HEPA filter without recirculation inside the cabinet or return to the laboratory; and have all contaminated ducts and plenums under negative pressure or surrounded by directly exhausted negative- pressure ducts and plenums. These cabinets may be used with volatile toxic chemicals and radionuclides. (ERR 1-Oct-2016) Class III: The Class III BSC is designed for work with highly infectious microbiological agents and other hazardous opera- tions. It provides maximum protection for the environment and the worker. It is a gas-tight enclosure with a viewing win- dow that is secured with locks and/or requires the use of tools to open. Both supply and exhaust air are HEPA/ULPA fil- tered. Exhaust air must pass through two HEPA/ULPA filters in series before discharge to the outdoors.
