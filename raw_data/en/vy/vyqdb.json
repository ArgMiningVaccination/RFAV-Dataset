They remove impurities and residual oil from the skin, while the addition of vitamin E nourishes the skin and gives it a fresh and radiant appearance. The natural Detox face mask is suitable for all skin types. Who should use the face masks? The face masks are intended for both men and women over 16. The mask contains 97% natural ingredients and is paraben and silicone-free and skin-friendly. What are the ingredients in the face mask? Activated charcoal - Activated charcoal effectively cleanses the skin, unclogs pores, and removes deeper impurities and dead skin cells. By removing dead skin cells and absorbing excess oil, activated charcoal helps to give skin a healthy glow. The result is smooth, supple, and evenly colored skin. Natural silica (silicon dioxide) - Silica gives the skin a radiant look and moisturizes it. It is also important for optimal collagen synthesis and the activation of hydroxylating enzymes, which improves the skin's strength and elasticity. Clay (kaolin) - has cleansing properties that can remove dirt and impurities from the skin pores that cause acne breakouts. It is gentle to use on the skin and cleanses it without making it dry. Castor oil - Castor oil is rich in ricinoleic acid, which acts as a humectant, retaining moisture by preventing water loss through the outer layer of the skin. It contains antioxidants that fight free radicals in the body and has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties - to reduce puffiness, soothe sunburn, and prevent acne. Vitamin E - It is a naturally occurring antioxidant that protects the skin against free radicals. It also increases skin moisture as it is fat-soluble. As a result, it can penetrate deep into the skin and preserve the lipids in the skin while healing the outer layer of the skin. Vitamin E ''seals'' cracks in the skin and prevents moisture loss, keeping the skin hydrated and firm. Glycerin - Glycerin is great for the skin as it acts as a humectant, allowing the skin to retain moisture. It increases the skin's moisture, alleviates dryness, refreshes the skin's surface, and softens the skin. Directions for use: Apply the mask evenly on cleansed skin. Avoid the areas around the eyes and mouth. Leave the face mask on for 10-15 minutes. Before it dries completely, rinse it off with warm water. After applying the mask, moisturize the skin with a moisturizing face cream. Recommended use is 2-3 times a week. Caution: Avoid the area around the eyes and lips. Test the product first on a small area of skin to test for possible hypersensitivity reactions. Storage: Store in a cool, dry place at a temperature of up to 25\u00b0C, away from direct sunlight and heat sources. Frequently asked questions 1. Do I have to wash my face after removing the face mask? Yes, you should wash your face after removing the mask. The activated charcoal has absorbed all the excess oil, dead skin cells, and impurities, so you don't want to leave them on your face. It can also dry out your face if left on for longer than the recommended time. 2. Do face masks help remove blackheads? Yes. Activated charcoal acts as a ''magnet'' for dirt and impurities that are trapped in the skin. As you start using face masks more regularly and taking care of your skin, there will be less accumulated dirt. For best results, use an exfoliating scrub (mechanical or, preferably, chemical) before applying the mask to effectively open the pores. 3. How long should I leave the mask on my face? In general, the mask should be left on the face for 10-15 minutes. Rinse it off before it dries completely. 4. How often should I use the face mask? We recommend using the face mask approximately 2-3 times a week or as needed. Keep an eye on the skin's response and adjust the application. 5. When is the best time to use a face mask? There is no definitive best time of the day, it has more to do with preparation, time to complete your skincare routine, and whether you use make-up. The best time to use it is probably in the evening, as you should completely remove your make-up and cleanse your face before applying the mask. 6. Do I need to apply a moisturizer after using the face mask? Yes, after rinsing off the mask, apply a moisturizer to hydrate your skin. We recommend [Hyaluron Face Cream](/en/natural-cosmetics/hyaluron-face-cream.html). 7. How to prep your skin before applying a face mask? Prepping before using a face mask is just as important as the face mask itself. First, you need to cleanse your face completely and remove all make-up from your skin (guys, just wash your face thoroughly). If you also use an exfoliator (either mechanical or acid-based chemical peel), use it before applying the mask to remove the top layer of dead skin cells, and excess oil and to unclog the pores. Before applying the face mask to your skin, rinse the scrub with warm water and cleanse your skin with a toner. Your skin is cleansed and ready for the mask. 8. How do I correctly apply a face mask? Starting from the top of the neck, apply the mask evenly in an upward motion. Be careful to avoid specific areas such as the eyes and mouth.
