Recommended Reviews [Learn more about reviews.](https://www.yelp.com/reviews-trust-link-tree?l=en_US) Overall rating 5 stars 4 stars 3 stars 2 stars 1 star - 2/25/2023 I give 5 stars because this chiropractor seems to be well liked. However this is not from experience. I would love to go try this chiropractor out but the initial fee is $140. That is too high an amount for me to pay without really knowing whether I will like the style of treatment or not. I wish you would consider lowering that initial price, you might end up with more long term clients. - 9/26/2022 Dr. Vanbuskirk is amazing! I've seen him in the past for bad back issues and it helped alot. For the past 4 months I've had plantar fasciitis pain and finally thought, maybe a chiropractor will help. I was desperate as it was not improving despite all my stretches and yoga that I've been doing. After only one visit he helped it heal up to 90% i would say! What a blessing he is!! - 9/20/2020 I received care from Dr. Van Buskirk for only about three months, but wish I would have found him sooner before I moved out of California. I have probably about ten chiropractors over the years and Dr. Van Buskirk was the most skilled and thorough. He was also a kind, honest, and sincere person who really seemed to care about me, and his other patients, as complete people. I'm sad that I can no longer receive care from him but highly recommend him to anyone in the area. - 1/30/2018Updated review Dr. Rod has been taking care of my family and neighborhood for over 22 years ! I can't thank him enough for the TLC, great care and professionalism in our spinal care. If your back needs attention, come to this caring office. You'll be referring all of your family and friends too.10/14/2015Previous review Dr. Rod has been keeping my family healthy and adjusted for 25 years! He has also been our neighborhood Dr. for as many years. We come for colds, flu symptoms and regular check-ups to stay aligned and healthy. Chiropractic care isn't your last resort, it should be your first stop in staying aligned and healthy. Dr. Rod educates you about spinal health and well being, not turning first to drugs and he really cares about you and your family. He has a gentle touch and feels where the problem is quickly because of his education and experience. I highly recommend this practice if you are looking for Chiropractic care! PS: Dr. Rod just did a first check on my three month old Granddaughter and she is perfect! He showed us how to carefully massage her tummy when she has distress and gave us some other tips to keep her comfortable as she grows. Thank you Natural Life Chiropractic! - 2/15/2018 I am so pleased that I found Dr Rod. He is an awesome chiropractor. There is a high level of competency, great attitude, very open with his knowledge and suggestions, and no pressure. I always come out of this office feeling so much better. I've rarely had to wait as he is always on time , scheduling is easy and has a pleasant office and staff. Definitely recommend Dr Rod! - 3/16/2020 I drove all the way from Santa Cruz to see Dr. Rod Van Buskirk. So does my husband. I used to live in Lafayette and established a great relationship 10 years ago. I have sent many people to him. He is a miracle worker! When I lived in Reno for four years I drove down and made sure to stop and see Dr. Rod. I've never found a better chiropractor. - 8/21/2017 Natural Life Chiropractic is my go to...Dr. Buskirk is an does treats you with care And is dedicated to improving your individual issues and determined to help you get the relief you need from pain!! - 10/3/2018 I traveled almost 2 hours to see Dr. VanBuskirk, and what everyone says is true, He is a very compassionate, and competent Dr. who really takes the time to listen to your needs, his staff is very friendly too. I have problems with C-1 cervical part of my neck and he is the only Dr. in Northern California who has the best tool for adjusting that. It's called The Atlas Orthogonal. It has pin point precision to where you need to adjust, it's very gentle on you, and has amazing results without heavy manipulation. More chiropractors need to get educated and follow his treatment. Thanks to Dr. VanBuskirk their are more people sleeping better tonight and having great tomorrows!! - 1/2/2018 Dr. Rod VanBuskirk and his staff are a hidden gem! I highly recommend Dr. VanBuskirk for the Atlas Orthogonal method. I swear by it. Dr. VanBuskirk won't \"snap, crackle and pop\" you. If you need relief without manual adjustment, contact his office for the Altas O method and tell them I sent you. I love that it's a small and friendly office where you're greeted with a smile and they remember who you are. Dr. VanBuskirk is knowledgeable on the Atlas O method and can tell within a few minutes where and how I need to be adjusted. As long as I'm in the area I will be seeing Dr. VanBuskirk and encourage you or someone you know to schedule a visit. There is no need to live in pain or discomfort.
