Volunteering is a positive way to engage your community and make a difference.

People aged 65 and older are more likely to experience physical inactivity and a diminished sense of purpose when their social roles change.

Research even shows volunteers may maintain their independence longer as they grow older because of the mental and physical stimulation experienced while volunteering. We are here when you need us!
