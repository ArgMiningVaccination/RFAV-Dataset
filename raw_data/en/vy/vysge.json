DATA POINT ON RI HOSPITALIZATIONS. On June 14, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine for children age 6 months through 5 years and Pfizer's vaccine for children age 6 months through 4 years. On June 18, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended these vaccines for these age groups. Both the Moderna vaccine for children 6 months through 5 years and the Pfizer vaccine for children 6 months through 4 years will be available in Rhode Island. The Moderna vaccine is a two-dose vaccine, with 28 days between the first and second dose. The Pfizer vaccine is a three-dose vaccine, with 21 days between the first and second dose and at least 8 weeks between the second and third dose. The doses for children are smaller than the doses given to adolescents and adults. Extensive trials were conducted with thousands of children to understand the safety and efficacy of these vaccines. No new safety concerns were identified. Independent scientists and researchers reviewed the safety and efficacy data and concluded that these vaccines are safe and effective at reducing infection, including infection caused by the Omicron variant. Both vaccines will continue to be monitored for safety. People who want to help checking these vaccines for safety can sign up for v-safe, a mobile tool that sends you confidential health check-ins by text message and web survey. This helps the CDC monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in near real time. For more information about COVID-19 vaccines, please "}
