The study, which was conducted by a team led by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital, King's College London and Zoe Global Ltd. is available in [medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.20084111v1). Health care workers on the front lines of the battle against COVID-19 face a high risk of becoming infected and are confronted with the possibility of not only getting sick and dying, but also of bringing the infection home to their families and contributing to spread in their communities. \"The limited availability of adequate PPE, such as masks, gowns and gloves, has raised concerns about whether our health care system is able to fully protect our health care workers,\" said senior author [Andrew T. Chan, MD, PhD](/doctors/17158/andrew-chan), Chief of the [Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit](/medicine/gastroenterology/research-and-clinical-trials/labs/andrew-chan) at Mass General and Director of Cancer Epidemiology at the [Mass General Cancer Center](/cancer-center). \"We conducted this study to understand the magnitude of risk for health care workers and what the impact of PPE shortages might be on infection rates.\" For the study, the investigators used a novel smartphone app\u2014called [the COVID Symptom Tracker](https://covid.joinzoe.com/us)\u2014 to examine the risk of testing positive for COVID-19 and/or developing symptoms associated with infection among 2,135,190 individuals in the U.K. and the U.S. between March 24 and April 23, 2020. Andrew T. Chan, MD, PhD The limited availability of adequate PPE, such as masks, gowns and gloves, has raised concerns about whether our health care system is able to fully protect our health care workers. Chief of Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit, Director of Cancer Epidemiology at Mass General Among 2,035,395 community individuals and 99,795 frontline health care workers, 5,545 new reports of a positive COVID-19 test were documented. Compared with the general community, frontline health care workers had an 11.6-times higher risk of testing positive and those who reported that they had inadequate access to PPE had a 23% higher risk. Also, compared with health care workers reporting adequate PPE who did not care for patients with COVID-19, workers caring for patients with documented COVID-19 had a nearly 5-times higher risk of testing positive if they had adequate PPE and a nearly 6-times higher risk if they had inadequate PPE. The finding that health care workers have a substantially higher risk of COVID-19 infection supports the importance of providing adequate supplies of PPE to those on the front lines. \"However, adequate supplies of PPE are not enough to completely protect workers taking care of COVID-19 patients\u2014we also need to focus our energy on making sure that health care workers are trained in the proper use of PPE and that the PPE is high quality,\" said Dr. Chan. \"We also must be vigilant about implementing other infection control measures to minimize infection of health care workers, including promptly and effectively testing and isolating COVID-19 patients and ensuring that the patient care environment is adequately disinfected.\" Funding Statement Zoe provided in kind support for all aspects of building, running and supporting the tracking app and service to all users worldwide.
