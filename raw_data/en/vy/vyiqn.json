Email: acuc@berkeley.edu Ph: 510-642-88551Accessing the SystemOccupational Health Surveillance System (OHSS) provides an automated mechanism for conducting a risk assessment and corresponding medical evaluation for employees with exposure to animal biohazards and other workplace or laboratory exposures. This system replaces the Animal Exposure Questionnaire (AEQ) as of Dec. 5, 2016. The system can be accessed at https://ehs.ucop.edu/ohss Browser Recommendations The system is available for use on all browsers, however it is recommended whenever possible to use Chrome. If using IE or Firefox, you must have the newest version installed on your computer for optimal results. CalNet ID In order to be access OHSS, all personnel must have a valid CalNet ID, an online identity which allows access to many UC Berkeley online services. A CalNet ID is generated for employees or students by their sponsoring department's Human Resources (HR) Representative. If you are a not a UCB employee or student (e.g., visiting summer students, volunteers), you can still obtain a CalNet ID from your sponsoring department.
