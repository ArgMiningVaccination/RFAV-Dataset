Tonyibe Overall the surgical staff were all very professional and caring. Procedure was quickly performed making me very comfortable. Thank you Dr Freedman and your staff for such a great experience. The goal of chiropractic treatment is to align the musculoskeletal structures of the body - the spine and joints - by using hands-on spinal manipulation and other techniques, addressing issues with your bones, muscles, tendons, cartilage ligaments, and nervous system. Chiropractic treatment is based on the idea that proper alignment of your spine enables the rest of the body to heal its other ailments. By adjusting the spine at particular pressure points, chiropractors unblock nerve energy and allow it to flow better down your spine and throughout your entire body. Repeated visits are recommended to optimize your overall health. You may experience additional benefits of chiropractic treatment outside of your initial pain complaint, including improved immune function, more energy, lower blood pressure, better balance, and better sleep. Chiropractic treatment is a safe and natural way to treat musculoskeletal complaints without medication or surgery. Conditions we treat with chiropractic care: If you have a physical injury, like a bone fracture, chiropractic care may not be right for you. Manipulation of the spine and joints can actually worsen those types of injuries. Patients with conditions such as osteoporosis or arthritis, that weaken bones and joints, can still seek chiropractic treatment; your chiropractor will just use gentler treatment. The best way to know for sure if chiropractic treatment is right for you is to schedule an evaluation with a chiropractor. Chiropractors provide one of the safest forms of pain relief, as it does not rely on medication or surgery, which have the risk of side effects or complications, but hands-on care. As long as you are choosing a properly licensed chiropractor, like the doctors at Redefine Healthcare's chiropractic clinic, there is very little risk involved. Unlike alternative treatment options, chiropractic care treats the cause of your problem, not just the associated symptoms. Many patients will turn to medication when they are in pain, and while this may provide some level of relief, medication will mask your symptoms, not treat them. By contrast, our chiropractic team works to treat the cause of your pain, which will then naturally alleviate your remaining symptoms. Chiropractic treatment is ideal for patients in pain who wish to decrease or eliminate the medication they take, as these medications often have potentially harmful side effects. Chiropractic treatment at Redefine Healthcare may include: Redefine Healthcare's chiropractic team focuses on more than just short-term treatment, helping in more ways than one. We look after each patient as a whole and can advise patients on other issues relating to their health, such as nutrition and exercise, that are essential components of a healthy lifestyle. We educate patients on at-home exercises designed for their specific pain condition, giving you the best chance of recovery. Your first chiropractic visit will be an evaluation by one of our board-certified chiropractors. Your chiropractor will evaluate what treatment you may need, and what parts of your body can benefit from it, examining your nerves, tendons, muscles, and ligaments in the areas your symptoms are stemming from. Following your initial evaluation, our chiropractic team will build a customized treatment plan to address your specific concerns, possibly bringing in another specialist if they believe you may benefit from another type of treatment as well. Some patients will see a chiropractor exclusively, while others will combine chiropractic treatment with other methods of pain relief as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. Chiropractic treatment is often paired with physical therapy in order to retrain the muscles and rebuild strength after your body has been adjusted to its proper form.
