Ten years ago, the main canine supplements available in pet shops were Cod Liver Oil and two vitamin supplements (Pet-tabs and SA37) along with powdered formula for hand rearing puppies, wormers and flea treatments. There were other dietary and some few topical and medically specific supplements on the market, but most were hard to find, and not well advertised. Today pet owners are becoming increasingly familiar with herbal medicines and supplements, current availability ranging from joint care (anything from kelp, through high doses of Vitamin C to Glucosamine) to veterinary approved mood calmers i.e. D.A.P (Ceva, 2010). Considering the plethora of herbal supplements on the market, only those of Dorwest Herbs (Dorwest Herbs, 2010) and Denes (Denes, 2010), established in 1948 and 1951 respectively, are licensed by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate. These products contain enough of some specific ingredients as to be considered medicinal i.e. \"... for treating or preventing disease in animals\" (VMD,1,2010), implying that all non VMD licensed pet supplements on the market, other than those homeopathic remedies eligible for 'Grandfather rights' under the Veterinary Medicines Regulations 2006 (Crown, 2006), are considered to be of no benefit with regard to, treating and/or preventing disease or exerting an immunological or metabolic response. Nutritional Recommendations The Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition has produced a list of minimum nutrient requirements for dogs per 400 Kcal of metabolisable energy [Appendix 1] (Kelly & Wills, 1996), however this list only details, 5 of the 7 major minerals, (generally required in large amounts by all animals), 6 of 10 essential trace minerals, 12 vitamins, fat and protein content and 1 fatty acid. There are no recommendations for the myriad of other vitamins, minerals and amino acids currently accepted by the BSAVA (British Small Animal Veterinary Association), nor is there such a thing as a Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) as with human guidelines. Animal Health A lack or excess of one or many vitamins, minerals or essential fatty acids can lead to \"major chronic diseases\" (Food and Nutrition Board, 1989), if prolonged can be fatal (Roche, 1976) and malnourished animals are \"likely to have a compromised immune system\" (Agar, 2001). The escalation of illness in pets over the past decade [average UK veterinary visit cost in 2000 \u00a362.01 (Bruce, 2001), average cost in 2009 \u00a3254(Petwise, 2009)] implies some issue within the genetics and/or the daily lives of our pets. Immune systems can often become compromised, this can be due to malnutrition, stress or drugs like antibiotics (Ewing & Haresign, 1989) and corticosteroids, at these times it can be helpful to boost the immune system with specific nutrients to prevent further illness. The ethos being that optimum health can be achieved through optimum nutrition. UK Legislation Currently all legislation with regard to pet foods is derived from the EU, there are also guidelines recommended by the Pet Food Manufacturers Association (PFMA 1, 2010) which are voluntarily applied to 95% of British pet foods. If a product claims or implies a medicinal benefit, then it is a medicinal product, according to the Food Safety Act 1990 (Crown, 1990), however \"health foods\" and supplements need to be judged by the Medicines Directorate. In order to adhere to the Veterinary Medicines Directorate to establish if a product is non-medicinal and therefore does not require licensing, their borderline ingredients list must be consulted (VMD,2,2010). Over fifty laws can be distilled in essence to: the use of ingredients certified fit for human consumption, (with the exemption of those toxic to the proposed animal) will exceed all current laws and recommendations. Immune-Aid - Not Just Another Pill To create a product that does not contravene current EU legislation or VMD specifications, that appeals to the average pet owner, is easy to produce and is both nutritionally competent and palatable, the simplest path seems to be to keep to raw, natural ingredients. As \"Meats and liver are more nutritious when fed raw\" (Holst, 2000), it is logical to use meats, that are fresh and certified fit for human consumption, as well as fruit and vegetables, herbs and other fresh ingredients known to boost the immune system. Why Raw? The storage stability of vitamins and minerals are impaired by cooking (Lugwigshafen et al. 1984). Phospholipids found in the cell walls of plant and animal material and essential for the health of each living cell are also broken down by heat. Phospholipids are needed in great quantities by the immune system, especially in the formation of pus in infected wounds (Pond, 2000). Why Frozen? Fatty Acids are not broken down by freezing, even up to -80\u00b0, however most cells and whole organisms are (Pond, 2000), in effect the freezing process can destroy most pathogenic bacteria in the same way as cooking, but without the deleterious effect of destroying the nutrients required for the health and wellbeing of the consumer. Ingredients Fresh meat and bone, fruit and vegetables, cottage cheese, live yogurt, egg, linseed oil (cold pressed), extra virgin olive oil, garlic and spirulina. Any cooking process negatively effects the vitamin and mineral content of foods, hence this supplement is composed of raw fresh foods and frozen to maintain its nutritional value. The first of these (meat & bone, fruit and vegetables) will be minced together and closely replicates what wild canids would naturally eat, they provide essential vitamins, minerals and lipids and add to the overall palatability of the product. N.B. The chicken content will be restricted to wings (being an optimum muscle to bone ratio). Cottage cheese contains a mineral also found in soil and faecal matter (Billinghurst, 2001), thus preventing your dog from eating these through the need for self medication, and reducing the risk of infection from other pathogens/bacteria. Live yogurt contains probiotic cultures which aid digestion and replace the good bacteria in the gut, but preventing microbial colonisation, increasing absorption of the small intestine, and producing anti-E.coli factors inhibiting the growth of many bacteria, especially pathogenic gram-negative types (Ewing & Haresign, 1989), and is advised to be given when on antibiotics (Lewis, Morris & Hand, 1988). The egg and oils balance out the omega 3 and 6 content helping to promote healthy skin and coat (Billinghurst, 2001). The Linseed Oil (high in Omega 3) must be cold pressed due to the deleterious effect of n-hexane's combination with lysine (from the seed) in the chemical extraction process, this forms 2,5-dimethylpyrrole (DeCaprio, Olajos & Weber, 1982) which is toxic (DeCaprio, Kinney & LoPachin, 2009), degenerating first the peripheral and then the central nervous system. The Olive Oil is Extra Virgin due to it being the least processed and therefore highest quality, high in monounsaturates, Omega 3 and Vitamin E and good for lowering cholesterol (Billinghurst, 2001). Garlic helps to boost the immune system by providing a hostile environment for parasites, it also helps maintain a healthy heart and circulatory system (Billinghurst, 2001). Spirulina is natures' super-food, a natural multi-vitamin and mineral which provides all the required amino acids in a form that is five times easier to digest than meat or soy protein. (Challem, 1981) Immune-aid does not contain grains, whilst useful for fibre content in many diets, the combination of increased permeability of gastric mucosa and the reduction in pH by lactic acid given off by fermenting starches can lead to ulcers, and structural/functional damage to stratified squamous, cardiac and gastric epithelium. Grains in a natural canine diet would be minimal, i.e. the stomach contents of a field mouse. Many gastrointestinal diseases can be attributed to feeding the wrong diet (Stevens & Hume, 1995) leading to further issues with absorption and then nutrition or the lack of. Appendix 2 lists what natural products are used and why. Appendix 3 provides details of the functions of the vitamins/minerals etc. derived from those foods listed in Appendix 2. A brief dissection of Appendix 3 shows the many advantages of the proposed ingredients. Discounted Ingredients Whilst honey is a well-known anti-biotic and anti-microbial, used as far back as ancient Egypt, there is no guarantee that the average pet owner will be able to brush the animals teeth after each meal. Colloidal Silver is also one of natures' anti-biotics, as silver has been used for centuries (silver tankards/penny used for purifying beer, when beer was cleaner than water) and is now even being used on plasters, however the cost of this is prohibitive. However a mixture of honey, colloidal silver, goats milk, evening primrose oil and cod liver oil, would make an excellent post-operative convalescence supplement. Goats milk is much more akin to dogs milk than cow or sheep milk and is easier to digest (Holst, 2000); Evening primrose and cod liver oils contain activated omega 3 & 6, which are easier to absorb than the inactive ones used in Immune-aid. (Billinghurst, 2001) Amounts The amounts in this product follow the guidelines as set out by the BARF Diet (Billinghurst, 2001) \"60% raw meaty bones, 15% crushed vegetable matter, 10% offal, 5% fruit, the remainder as supplements to mimic faeces and soil\". Bear in mind that these quantities are not simply arbitrary but based on research of the diet of a dogs wild counterparts, after all even the milk of a domestic dog contains 40% protein (Stevens & Hume, 1995), as opposed to the much lower content (between 4 and 30%) we tend to wean them onto. Testing This product has been tested for over 8 years, using 60+ animals over 4 generations. These animals were provided with this supplement on a regular basis as part of their standard diet. Accidental exposure to Parvo- virus in 2006 demonstrated a higher immunity in those animals who were third and fourth generation, than other members of the pack. Puppies have been reared on this product from 3 weeks of age (mixed at that age with goats milk), and post-operative animals whose prospects were bleak according to their vet, have been fed on it exclusively and now prosper into old age (authors personal experience). Labelling and Advertising The VMD have standards which must be adhered to with regards to advertising (VMD,3,2010). From 1st September 2010 responsibility for aspects of food labelling has transferred from the Food Standards Agency to DEFRA. Labels must be truthful, include a list of ingredients, display storage instructions and durability in accordance with the Food Labelling Regulations 1996, and must also adhere to food composition legislation and European marketing standards. (FSA, 2010). The moisture, fat, protein, ash and fibre content need to be calculated by a specialized company such as FAPAS (http://www.fapas.com), part of the Food and Environmental Research Agency, therefore the figures given on Label 1 below, may require correction. Label 1 Conclusion Optimal nutrition lends itself towards optimal health, a great number of vitamins, minerals and lipids are utilised by the body, not just for energy, but specifically for health. A good combination of these healthy nutrients in a palatable, easy to provide package, can aid the body to heal itself, by boosting the immune system and the health of not only each organ, but each individual cell. Canids who are ill, stressed or immune suppressed (upon veterinary approval), would profit from Immune-aid, long term use of which can benefit health and longevity.
