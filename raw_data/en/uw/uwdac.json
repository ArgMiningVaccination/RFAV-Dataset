We explored thefeasibility and methods of recruitment, retention, and potential signal of ef cacy, of selected homeopathic medicines as preventive measure for developing COVID-19 in amulti-group study.Materials and Methods A six-group, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pro- phylaxis study was conducted in a COVID-19 exposed population in a quarantine facility in Mumbai, India. Each group received one of the following: Arsenicum album 30c, placebo. Six pills twice a day were administered for 3 days. The primary outcome measure used was testingrecruitment and retention in this quarantined setting. Secondary outcomes were numberstesting positive for COVID-19 after develop ing symptoms of illness, number of subjects hospitalized, and days to recovery.Results Good rates of recruitment and retention were achieved. Of 4,497 quarantined individuals, 2,343 sought enrollment, with 2, 294 enrolled and 2,233 completing the trial (49.7% recruitment, 97.3% retention). Subjects who were randomized to either Bryonia alba or to the CVN01 nosode ( p<0.10) a lower incidence of laboratory-con rmed COVID- 19 and a shorter period of illness, with evidence of fewer hospitalizations, than those taking placebo. The three other groups did not show signals of ef cacy. Conclusion This pilot study supports the feasibility of a larger randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Published online: 2021-09-30Introduction Exploring preventive therapeutic measures has been among the biggest challenges during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. As per the WHO, 1a total of 158,551,526 con rmed cases of COVID- 19, including 3,296,855 deaths, had been reported by May 10,2021. Although highly effective vaccines have been recently made available, there remains continued need for novel methods of prophylaxis, should the current vaccinationprograms decline in ef cacy, or as needed alternatives potentially for those individuals who cannot be vaccinated by the currently available vaccines. 2 In addition, and complementary to conventional vaccines, homeopathic medicines have been discussed extensively as potentially preventive in epidemics of dengue,3and have been tested to various degrees in the prevention of leptospi- rosis4and in fluenza.5Some homeopathic nosodes have shown speci potential in in vitro ,6animal,7,8 and human models.9,10The COVID-19 pandemic offered another opportunity to examine homeopathy 's potential through controlled trials. Previously, the Ministry of Ayur-veda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) has recommended the use of Arsenicum album 30c as preventive for at-risk groups. 11 Commonly used homeopathic medicines used as preven- tives against in the SARS- CoV-2 pandemic there were numerous reports that several of these remedies, including Bryonia alba , were frequently indicated.12The use of a combination of homeopathic med- icines is a common technique that many practitioners follow. Many such combinations of medicines are sold over the counter or as supplements by pharmaceutical companies in many countries. In the present study, we have thereforeused Arsenicum album 30c, Bryonia alba chronic or constitutional remedy is also common practice, but this was not explored in this trial. 13 We designed this trial with multiple groups as the virus was novel and there was a need to evaluate if any homeo- pathic medicine might show a potential bene cial effect. In early drug discovery, it is not unusual to test several mole- cules in a multi-group trial to see if any show a signal of efcacy. In this way, one may completely discard some molecules, while continuing with further, more robust, studies using a molecule that elicited a potential signal.14 Further, the bene t of design allows for economies of scale, a smaller pool of needed subjects, as well as cost savings. The city of Mumbai reported the highest number of COVID- 19 infected patients in India from April 2020 onwards.15During therst 6 months, Mumbai had more than 20% of all COVID-19 cases in India, having 115,346 cases and 6,395 deaths from the start of the epidemic until the end of July, 2020.16In Mumbai,there are 24 regional administrative wards under Brihanmum- bai Municipal Corporation (BMC).17The present study was conducted by Life Force Foundation Trust in cooperation with the BMC, ward \"S\", one administrative region in Mumbai. BMC ward \"S\"strategically quarantined all high-risk individuals who were exposed to con rmed cases of COVID-19, patients from UN-de ned \"slum \"areas, and heavily crowded residential locations, to be housed in one of two distant quarantine facilitiesfor 2 weeks. The present study took place in one of these facilities, housing 4,497 exposed persons. \"S\"ward medical staff managed the accommodation, lodging, food, sanitization, med-ical supervision, and all needs for the subjects, while Life Force Center managed the study and collected relevant data. All quarantined populations were medically monitored. Thosedeveloping clinical symptoms were tested for COVID-19 and were moved to COVID-19 hospitals if tested positive. From March 2020 to August 2020, due to the shortage of diagnostickits, diagnostic tests were performed only if the patients presented with clinical symptoms. Objective The primary aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility and methods of recruitment and retention of a sample of subjects within in a multiple-group randomized design. Secondary aims were to assess any potential signal of ef cacy of commonly recommended homeopathic medicines for the prevention of COVID-19 in a high-risk population at a government-run quarantine facility for a COVID-19 exposedpopulation, as well as assessing the number of subjects hospitalized and days to recovery. Secondary outcome meas- ures would be used to develop ef cacy trials with fewer treatment groups. Materials and Methods Study Design This was a six-group randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled study designed to evaluate feasibility for a follow- on trial, testing potential ef cacy of homeopathic prepara- tions in quarantined populations having exposure to at least one case of COVID-19 in their building, chawl (thickly populated \"slum \"area where several people live in small rooms), community, or workplace (for example, hospitals, BMC workers, or similar risk groups). Participant data were gathered in the quarantined facility for 14 days. Once re-leased from quarantine and allowed to return home, due to the lockdown restrictions the participants were all contacted telephonically and not physically present at the time of their30-day scheduled visit. Approval The trial protocol was reviewed by the Life Force Foundation Trust Scienti c Advisory Board and approved by an Institu- tional Ethics Committee constituted by Homeopathy IndiaPrivate Limited. The trial was registered at the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI), trial registration number: CTRI/ 2020/05/025491. Telephone consent was obtained from every Homeopathy \u00a9 2021.

Copyrighted material. subject and a waiver for the written informed consent forms was obtained from the Ethics Committee due to the stringentsafety measures in place during the lockdown period. Interventions Group 1: Arsenicum album 30c. Group 2: Bryonia alba 30c. Group 3: a combination pills were used. Coronavirus nosode CVN01 is a variant of nosode, pre- pared from a clinical sample,18which has undergone a Phase 1 study19and a homeopathic pathogenetic trial.20 The homeopathic medicines used in the present study were prepared as per the directives of the Homoeopathy Pharmacopoeia of India, under the Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India. The medicines are essentially freefrom toxic effects as they undergo the process of potentiza- tion using 90% alcohol as vehicle. Dose: Six pills (size 30) twice a day for 3 consecutive days. Study Population Recruitment occurred within the government-run high-riskquarantine facility. Subjects satisfying pre-speci ed criteria were included in the study. A total of 2,343 subjects were assessed for eligibility, with 2,294 enrolled and randomizedin the study from June 4, 2020 to July 27, 2020. Subjects meeting the following criteria were included in the study: 1. Age between 5 and 100 years. 2. Male- and female-bodied individuals. 3. Quarantined individuals. 4. COVID-19 risk groups (for example, police or hospital staff) exposed to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-con rmed case/s of COVID-19. 5. The participant and/or the caregiver is willing and able to provide informed consent for participation in the study. 6. Subjects agree to consume homeopathic medication. 7. Subjects agree not to self-medicate with potential anti- viral agents. Subjects meeting the following criteria were excluded from the study: 1. Subjects who were detected as SARS-CoV-2 positive at baseline (as per data provided by the BMC team). 2. Inability to be followed up for the trial period. 3. Subjects who had taken any homeopathic preventive medicine immediately before their enrollment. 4. Subjects scheduled to receive any other investigational drug during the study. Study End Points and Assessments The primary outcome measure used was percent of recruitment and retention in a quarantined setting. Secondary outcomemeasures included a comparative study of different groups and the placebo group with respect to the number of subjects testing positive on RT-PCR to COVID-19. Other secondary out-c o m e sw e r en u m b e ro fs u b j e c t sh o s p i t a l i z e da n dd a y st o recovery. Recovery was judged based on the reply to a question-naire (on days 15 and 30 \u2014see below), time interval to turn asymptomatic, and the duration of hospital stay. Study Method Demographic characteristics were recorded from the source notes by the coordinator at the facility. Enrolled subjects inthe study were given coded bottles of homeopathic medicine and were advised to consume medication twice a day for three consecutive days. The study coordinator had handedover the homeopathic medicine bottle to the quarantined individual while maintaining physical distancing at the study site. All individuals were advised to take the rst dose in front of the study coordinator. For compliance, bilingual instruc- tions (Marathi and English) on printed stickers, on medicine bottles as well as videos, were sent to almost all the subjectson their mobile phones. Every medicinal bottle had a printed label, linked to a webpage offering more information and emergency reporting. While in quarantine, all subjects were under the care of a physician trained in COVID-19 diagnosis. If experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, the subjects were instructed to reportto the center coordinator. Subjects experiencing symptoms were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and positive cases were sent for further treatment as per the standard protocol of the BMC.Data of those subjects were captured by the study coordina- tor, and subjects who were positive were followed telephon- ically on day 15 and day 30. As a part of a questionnaire, thesubjects were asked questions about symptom severity, well- being, and duration of hospital stay. Subjects were advised to report (telephonically or in person) to the quarantine centercoordinator if they were experiencing any COVID-19 symp- toms or potentially untoward side effects during the month of the study period. Subjects who were asymptomatic or did not test positive for COVID-19, and who took the homeopathic medicines,stayed at the BMC-run quarantined facility for 14 days and were monitored closely by their medical team. On the 15 th day, the subjects who were asymptomatic, and were not exposed to positive cases during these 15 days, were dis- charged from the quarantine facility. Due to the lockdown restrictions, and thus avoiding the need to be physicallypresent, the participants were contacted telephonically at the time of the 30-day scheduled visit. Randomization Randomization was performed using a computer-generated random number table, and concealment was achieved bystrict adherence to a single sequential numbered list that was sealed and kept in controlled access. The subject, the doctor, and the site coordinator were each unaware of thepreventive medicine they were given. The blinded design allowed for an unbiased evaluation of the intervention and became the basis for the use of statistical methods whileanalyzing the data. Identical pills (size 30) and bottles were provided to all the treatment groups, which involved ve different medicines and one placebo group. A total of 2,400 Homeopathy \u00a9 2021.

Copyrighted material. bottles were prepared for distribution and sent to the facility for distribution. The subjects at the quarantine center werefrom all localities of the city of Mumbai. The decoding was conducted by the investigator. Statistics and Data Analysis Data captured from the quarantine center and data collected by the study coordinator telephonically were entered in apre-speci ed form and analyzed. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS ver- sion 1.0.0.1447. All available data were presented in apatient 's data listing, which was sorted by a unique patient identi er. Demographic characteristics were presented as data listings and summary statistics from the 2,233 subjectswho completed the trial. Whilst intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis that comprised all patients randomized into the study would have been the best approach, it was impracticalas subjects might be moved in and out of the facility due to crowding issues, controlled by government regulations, and we would lose contact with them. We pre-designed the studyinstead to use the Ef cacy Evaluable analysis set, comprising all patients in the ITT analysis who had been enrolled according to the protocol and who completed the clinicaltrial plus observation period of 30 days, or were withdrawn from the study due to an adverse event. In this study, at each analysis, there were two independent comparison groups, and the outcome of interest was dichoto- mous (i.e., the patient tested positive by the end of day 30 [ \u00bc1] or not [ \u00bc0]). Two-sample proportion tests (two-proportion Z-test) were used to determine whether the proportions of the two groups were the same or different. The goal of the analysis was to compare proportions of positive cases after day 30between two groups. As a secondary analysis of two samples, we explored the same data using a Fisher Exact test, to be presented as an odds ratio. As this feasibility study was to explore a signal of efcacy, and not to prove ef cacy, we considered a one-sided alternative and the level of signi cance p<0.05 as a positive signal. For days to recover, since the sample sizes were small, we explored using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Whilst multi-group trials carry many bene ts by testing multiple hypotheses within one trial, they increase the potential for type-1 error, or false positives. Many times,very early exploratory trials do not use multiple-testing correction, and if they nd a signal then either they pare down the groups of a trial or they use some form of multiple-testing correction. 21As this is a feasibility and exploratory trial, no correction was applied. Results A total of 4,497 individuals were quarantined during the time of the study, of which 2,343 volunteered to be assessed for eligibility (52.1%). Of the 2,343 subjects, 37 were under age 5, which did not satisfy the inclusion criteria, and 12 participantshad already consumed the homeopathy medication Arsenicum album recommended by the government. Of the remaining 2,294 randomized subjects, 58 enrolled in the study and whowere asymptomatic were considered dropouts as they were shifted to another quarantine center by the BMC, out of ourstudy site. Three other subjects (two in the combination group and one in the Camphora group) had completed the day 15 visit and were asymptomatic, but they did not complete the day 30telephonic visit after being discharged from the quarantine center: they were therefore not counted. Retention of random- ized individuals to completion was 97.3%. Of the 2,233 retainedanalyzed subjects, 1,077 were female and 1,156 were male, having a mean age of 32.66 years. The lowest age of the subjects was 5 years and the highest age was 91 years. The rst subject enrollment date was June 4, 2020, and the last subject enroll- ment was conducted on July 27, 2020. Subjects 'disposition is represented as per the flowchart ( Fig. 1 ) and demographic details ( Table 1 ). The group receiving the combination of Arsenicum album ,Bryonia alba ,Gelsemium and Influenzinum contained twice the number of participants: we had hypothe-sized that the combination might have provided better results during this dynamic situation of changing symptom complexes. The numbers of individuals per group who tested positive for COVID-19 were as follows: Bryonia alba 30c, four out of 310 out of album 30c, seven out of 311 (2.25%); Fig. 1 Flowchart for randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled feasibility study evaluating the ef cacy of homeopathic medicines in the prevention of COVID-19 in a quarantined population.

The number of hospitalized individuals was least in each of the Bryonia alba and CVN01 groups, though these numbers were very small for all groups ( Fig. 2 ). Lastly, we looked at days to recover ( Table 4 ). Since the distribution could not be assessed due to sample size, we usedthe non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Here, the cantly different from placebo ( p\u00bc0.03). Discussion The city of Mumbai has faced one of the worst spreads of COVID-19 infection in the world, as it topped India 's lists formonths in terms of total COVID-19 positive cases. In con- gested chawls, with shared toilets, viral spread increased exponentially. Limited availability of diagnostic kits hin-dered early detection and isolation of infected individuals. The COVID-19 pandemic created the need for research in drug discovery for novel treatment, as well as various methods inprevention, including accelerated vaccine programs that have led to 14 approved vaccines to date. 22,23 Within this background we assessed the homeopathic method of prophylaxis by testing the hypothesis that taking a homeopathic medicine while healthy may prevent either transmission or severity of illness caused by an infectiousagent. For measuring prophylaxis, we selected the end point as symptomatic illness that led to a positive COVID-19 test. This is the same primary end point chosen for regulatoryapproval in most vaccine studies. 24,25 The need for a variety of preventive solutions is impera- tive since we do not yet have substantive experience with theSARS-CoV-2 virus or related vaccines. The current vaccines are approximately 90% effective in the short term. We do not know how long this ef cacy will last, and if the current vaccines will continue to work. More importantly, we do notTable 1 Demographic characteristics (gender and age) by treatment arm Group ( n)A g e G e n d e r Mean Range Male Female CVN01 nosode (312) 32.6 5 -82 161 151 Bryonia (310) 31.5 6 -87 157 153 Arsenicum (311) 32.7 5 -91 150 161 Combination (655) 31.4 5 -80 361 294 Camphora (315) 33.5 5 -78 165 150 Placebo (330) 35.2 5 -85 162 168 Table 2 Probability of laboratory-con rmed COVID-19 cases in treatment groups, as compared with placebo by day 30 of the study (Z-test) COVID-19 positive COVID-19 negative /330 \u00a9 Faculty of Homeopathy.

Copyrighted material. yet know if people will be able to tolerate repeated booster or annual vaccines. Other options are thus both necessary and desirable. Furthermore, there are some individuals that areunable to tolerate these vaccines, as for example those who have had a severe allergic reaction to ingredients of the vaccine or who developed vaccine-induced immune throm-botic thrombocytopenia, as well as those who are severely immune compromised. As one speci c example, recent reports indicate that some individuals who are currentlyunder immunosuppressive treatment may gain little bene t from the vaccines. 26,27These people need an alternative pathway. Lastly, as the vaccine production and rollout stalls,with dif culties in procurement in developing countries due to internal local infrastructure challenges, as well as being bedeviled by unpredictable and continual viral mutations, aneffective alternative is vital. Use of therapies that currently fall into the category of integrative medicine, such as homeopathy, is limited byinsufcient high-quality studies, of which there is a need in general and for COVID-19 in particular. 28Regarding ran- domized controlled trials of homeopathy, a 2003 reviewidenti ed upper respiratory tract infection as the most frequently researched topic of disease.29With the possibility that the vaccination program does not lead to a long-term complete solution, it becomes important to test potentialstrategies, especially those that may have a long history in theeld, such as homeopathy. 30To build a more robust evidence base of trials, it may be appropriate to build uponprior treatment research to examine if it might be extended to selected preventive intervention. Having a focus on the prevention of upper respiratory tract infection may thereforebe an appropriate area of exploration. There are several methods of prescribing homeopathy for the prevention of infections during epidemics, includinggenus epidemicus (based on the most commonly indicated acute medicine in the current pandemic), nosodes such as Influenzinum , and a combination of commonly prescribed medicines. Prescribing an individualized chronic remedy is also useful in epidemics, though not tested here. We decided to compare several homeopathic medicines to re ne options to test for ef cacy in a more robust follow-on trial. The Bryonia alba and COVID-19 nosode (CVN01) groups showed fewer people developing symptomatic COVID-19 than did so in the placebo group. In addition, the CVN01 group signaled fewer symptomatic days when comparedwith the placebo group. The symptom complex described forArsenicum album and Bryonia alba matched with that of COVID-19 disease, though Arsenicum album showed no differentiation from placebo. A combination of the common homeopathic medicines has shown non-signi cant results, which might be explained by some inhibitory effects of oneof the medicines in the combination. Camphora 'ssymptom complex does not match well with acute infection symptoms of the disease, which may explain its inferior results ascompared with the placebo group. When comparing the Bryonia alba group with the placebo group, the former had 67% fewer diagnosed subjects than didthe latter. Were this to be the result in a larger ef cacy trial, it could have great signi cance for public health. Interestingly, thisnding matches previous results from other diseases. For example, in a study on tularemia, Jonas presented results that were signi cantly better than placebo (22%), but not as effective as vaccinations (100%). 31If there is some level ofTable 3 Odds ratio of laboratory con rmed COVID-19 cases in treatment groups, as compared with placebo by day 30 of thestudy (Fisher Exact test) OR ratio.Table 4 Median days to recovery for RT-PCR-con rmed cases of COVID-19, comparing different treatment arms with theplacebo group N Median IQR p-Values CVN01 nosode 5 5 2 . 5 >0.05 Arsenicum 71 0 1 . 5 >0.05 Combination 18 9.5 4.75 >0.05 Camphora 12 13 4.25 >0.05 Placebo 13 12 7.25 - Abbreviations: IQR, interquartile range; RT-PCR, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.

This feasibility study has yielded a comparative strati ca- tion of commonly used homeopathic medicines and a newcoronavirus nosode. The potential for homeopathic medicines as prophylactic should be further explored on a larger scale. Our study points us to a larger trial comprising only two tothree groups, investigating Bryonia alba and/or COVID-19 nosode (CVN01) and placebo, with the evaluation of immuno- logical biomarkers as indicated based on the present results.With data from this current trial, we estimate that the next trial with a dichotomous end point, and with \u00bc0.05, \u00bc0.2, power \u00bc0.8, and incidence for placebo \u00bc3.94%, for two inde- pendent samples, would need 1,136 subjects if testing Bryonia alba (incidence, 1.29%) or 1,542 subjects if testing CVN01 nosode (incidence, 1.6%) against placebo. Challenges in the trial included the facts that individual contacts with the subjects and close monitoring was dif cult due to the regulatory restrictions and that a limited number ofvolunteers were collecting the data during the countrywide lockdown. Other limitations of the study include the impossi- bility of physical examination of every participant due to thesocial distancing recommendations, as well as the lackof some laboratory investigations because testing was rationed by the government during the time of the trial. Another limitationmight be the disposition of the study participants, who were quarantined at a controlled facility. It may be that results would vary if the subjects had been free to move about the city.In a follow-on trial, to test transmission rates as well, all subjects would be tested for coronavirus before, during, and at the end of the trial. These data were not captured during thevaccination development trials, but measuring transmission rates might help us understand bene ts of this form of poten- tial protection. In a related comment, 10% of the subjects were under 15 years of age and were equally distributed amongst the groups. Young people are less susceptible tothe SARS-CoV-2 virus and do not become symptomatic as easily as older age groups. 32Testing all subjects in a forthcoming trial would capture a potentially latent sub-set. This was a multi-group trial, and testing multiple hypoth- eses within one trial increases the potential for type-1 error, a false positive. As such, the p-values presented here only show a potential signal of ef cacy, and should be more extensively explored. In an upcoming trial, one could remedy this situation by testing only one homeopathic medicineversus placebo, as for example examining the COVID-19 nosode (CVN01) or Bryonia alba versus placebo. Alternative- ly, one could design a study with three groups: COVID-19nosode (CVN01), Bryonia alba , and placebo. In this last design, to adjust p-values, one would use a multiple-testing correction, not appropriate in the current study. Conclusion A good proportion of potential subjects were recruited and retained in this feasibility study. COVID-19-exposed subjects who were randomized to either Bryonia alba or tothe COVID-19 nosode signaled a lower incidence of symp- tomatic illness with COVID-19, and were ill for a shorterperiod of time with fewer hospitalizations, than those taking placebo. A larger ef cacy study is warranted and feasible, and should be limited to two or three groups, using Bryonia alba and/or the COVID-19 nosode (CVN01), six-group, randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled prophylaxis study was conducted in a COVID-19 exposed population in a quarantine facility in Mumbai. \u0081The study elicited initial signals of ef cacy for two homeo- pathic medicines in reducing the incidence of symptom- atic illness and in shortening the course of disease. \u0081The study supports the feasibility of a larger random- ized controlled trial. \u0081Bryonia alba 30c and the coronavirus nosode CVN01 30c should both be explored for their potential in disease prevention.
