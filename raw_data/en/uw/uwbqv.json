Durian shell and rind have been shown to have antioxidant activity; however, the antioxidant activity of durian pulp has not been examined. In this study, the durian pulp antioxidant activity was evaluated as well as a closely related fruit, Artocarpus heterophyllus (jackfruit). First, TEAC assays were conducted to determine durian and jackfruit antioxidant activity. Next, durian and jackfruit were introduced to PtK-2 cells at a 2.0% concentration (in DMSO) and to determine if these dosages could \"rescue\" cell death caused by hydrogen peroxide. Initial data supports the hypothesis that both species possess enough antioxidant properties to prevent total cell death cause during the \"rescue\". However, the quantitative data suggests that jackfruit is a stronger antioxidant than durian because the population of viable cells within the well treated with jackfruit concentration was significantly higher compared to the durian wells. Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, China Objective: To explore the law and distribution characteristics of acupoint sensitization among the IBS patients with meridian theory and graph theory, for further understanding of acupoint sensitization in clinical practice. Methods: For mathematical modeling, achieve the acupoints and their indications of diseases in the classic books of acupuncture and moxibustion. Establish the acupoint-indications network based on the graph theory and record the topological parameters such as clustering coefficient, vector centrality etc. For the clinical trial part, the method of cohort study was adopted to include the patients meeting the diagnostic criteria of IBS and the acupoint sensitivity data was measured through body meridian energy system. The topological indexes obtained by mathematical modeling were introduced to calculate the weighted average of topological parameters of the Yuan point, so as to further analyze its correlation with the disease and compare with the traditional analysis methods. Results: 1. Acupoint-symptom complex network of acupuncture and moxibustion classic books all show \"small world effect\", among which acupoint nodes close centrality and feature vector centrality indexes present acupoint specificity, which can be used as acupoint weight index for weighted average algorithm; 2. The original point resistivity abnormality rate of patients with diarrhea irritable bowel syndrome was 40.71% and that of healthy subjects was 29.49%. The resistance of patients with irritable bowel syndrome was higher than that of healthy subjects; 3. Based on the weighted average algorithm of intermediary centrality or eigenvector centrality, the weighted average of topological parameters of primary point resistance in patients with diarrhea irritable bowel syndrome was higher than that of healthy subjects. Conclusion: 1. Having \"small-world effect\" may be one of the topological characteristics of acupoint-symptom complex network; 2. The increase of skin primary point resistance in patients with IBS-D is a manifestation of acupoint sensitization; 3. Acupoint Hegu (LI4) sensitization on behalf of the large intestine meridian is one of the specific manifestations of primary acupoint sensitization in patients with diarrhea irritable bowel syndrome; 4. It is a feasible attempt to study and express the law of acupoint sensitization based on graph theory.

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the spasticity-related pain and the quality of life about the children with cerebral palsy with spasticity-related pain in China. Methods: This was a prospective, observational, one-arm multicenter study. 137 cerebral palsy children with SRP and their parents/caregivers were recruited from three sites in China. The children and their parents/caregivers completed the Questionnaire on pain caused by Spasticity and PedsQLTM 4 scale. Results: 137 children with their parents/caregivers were eligible for participation in the study and all completed the relevant investigation. According to the result of the children-report PedsQL, the total scale scores in the V2/V3 about the different age groups (5-7 years old, 8-12 years old, 13-16 years old) had no statistical significance (P>0.05). After 3 weeks, the change compared to first time survey result was not significant (p>0.05). The total scores and each domain of PedsQL in the CP with SRP was lower than the normal group (P<0.05). On the whole, the associations between the child and parent proxy-report QPS total scores and each domain scores of PedsQL were moderate to high. The PedsQL total scores relationship to the QPS item score was moderate. Conclusion: The quality of life in the CP patients with SRP was worse than normal people and it was a steady long-term stage. The correlation between the spasticity-related pain and the quality of life was moderate to high and negative and the result from the parent proxy-report was more evident. 1College of Agriculture, Nigeria 2Indian Veterinary Research Institute, India Trypanosomosis, a zoonotic disease is on the increase in recent years. Current limited classes of drugs in used are facing lot of problems. As a result of this Lantana camara leaves, a poisonous leaves were subjected to different stages of purification such as methanolic extraction, column chromatography, rechromatography, thin layer chromatography, preparative thin chromatography, liquid chromatography (HPLC) and structure elucidation and lantadene D was obtained. Lantadene D at concentrations (250-1000 \u00b5g ml-1) was screened against Trypanosomaevansi on Vero cell line grown in Dulbeccos Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Sigma) in 96-well flat bottom micro culture plates (Nunc, Denmark). Each well received 100 \u00b5l of DMEM containing 5x105 cells/ml. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2 for 48 hr to complete development of monolayer. After the formation of confluent monolayer, the medium (DMEM) was discarded and replaced with a fresh DMEM. And the medium was supplemented with 20-40% fetal calf serum (FCS), Gibco USA and antibiotics (100 units penicillin, 100 \u00b5g streptomycin and 40 \u00b5g gentamycin). A high parasitaemic blood from mouse was diluted with DMEM to obtain final trypanosomes of 1x106 trypanosomes/ml. The suspension (100 ml of medium with trypanosomes) was added at rate of 1:1 to pure compound lantadene D from Lantana camara and the plate was incubated under the same conditions mentioned above. The test was repeated at least thrice. In vitro cytotoxicity was performed on the same medium at concentrations (1.56-100 \u00b5g/ml) but without supplement of fetal calf serum in triplicate and incubated under the same conditions described previously. In this research, pure compound lantadene D from Lantana camara showed marked trypanocidal activity with reduction of trypanosomes in corresponding ELISA plate wells at concentration of 250 \u00b5g/ml, (40.\u00b10.0 to 4.667\u00b10.3), after 9 hr of incubation. However at 500 \u00b5g/ml of lantadene D, trypanosomes were not detectable in ELISA plate wells at 9 hr of incubation. Lantadene D and diminazine aceturate were cytotoxic to Vero cells in all concentrations except at 6.25 \u00b5g/ml, respectively. Pure compound Lantadene D from L. camara at the same concentration showed the same level of cytotoxic effects with diminazine aceturate, the reference drug despite toxic nature of the former to animals. Lantadene D displayed significant trypanocidal activity. This may pave way for a nascent drug discovery.

Rutgers University, USA Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most common cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and is an early indication for liver transplantation. In a search for Anti-HCV phytochemical, we found that the Eclipta alba extract potently inhibited RNA-dependent RNA (NS5B) in-vitro. When the extract was supplemented in a cell culture system, it effectively blocked both HCV RNA replication and translation in MH 14 cells carrying the replicating HCV subgenomic replicon. Bioassay-based fractionation of concentrated and preparative scale reverse-phase HPLC chromatography isolated five compounds that exhibited Anti-HCV activity in a cell culture system. Three of these compounds identified as wedelolactone, leteolin and apigenin, phytochemicals from Eclipta alba may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of chronic HCV infection and restoration of liver function.

The search for new compounds originating from natural resources is a promising research area. We hypothesized that animals living in polluted environments are potential source of novel antimicrobial molecules. Under polluted milieus, organisms such as cockroaches encounter different types of microbes including superbugs. Such creatures survive on slaught of super bugs and are able to ward off disease by producing antimicrobial substances. Here, we characterized antibacterial properties in extracts of various body organs of cockroaches (Periplaneta americana) and showed potent antibacterial activity in crude brain extract against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and neuropathogenic E. Coli K1. The size-exclusion spin columns revealed that the active compound(s) are less than 10 kDa in molecular mass. Using cytotoxicity assays, it was observed that pre-treatment of bacteria with lysates inhibited bacteria-mediated host cell cytotoxicity. Using spectra obtained with LC-MS on 1290 quadruple mass spectrometer, tissues lysates were analyzed. Among hundreds of compounds, only a few homologous compounds were identified that contained isoquinoline group, chromene antimicrobial properties and possess anti-inflammatory, anti-tumour and analgesic properties. Further identification, characterization and functional studies using individual compounds can act as a break through in developing novel therapeutics against various pathogens including super bugs.

International Council of Electrohomeopathy, Malaysia Alternative medicine is an approach to healing used in place of conventional medicine. Complementary medicine, on the other hand, is used together with conventional medicine. For example, if a special diet is used to treat cancer in place of surgery recommended by a conventional doctor, the diet would serve as an alternative therapy. However, if a special diet were used to combat high cholesterol levels in a patient with heart disease, in addition to coronary artery bypass surgery, the diet would serve as a complementary therapy. Since the same therapy can serve as either complementary or alternative, the various therapies outside the domain of conventional medicine are often grouped together under the term CAM (complementary and alternative medicine) therapies. The increasing interest in alternative medicine, which attempts to treat a patients body, mind and spirit can be viewed as a measure of the spiritual hunger in our high-tech society. The desire within the medical community to integrate treatments for a patients spiritual needs as well as physical needs is validating the importance of pastoral care in the hospital setting. Perhaps an approach to healing that makes use of the strengths of both conventional medicine and alternative medicine would enable a person to experience the best of both medical worlds. The forms of alternative medicine with scientific backing could be used to maintain health and increase physical fitness, while conventional medicine could be used to accurately diagnose and eradicate disease. Certain cautions, however, should be observed.

Lincoln University College, Malaysia Blood cupping therapy is a form of complementary medicine practiced by extracting the blood that is believed to be harmful from the body. Ninety three subjects aged between 30 and 60 years old participated in the study aims to determine the effect of blood cupping therapy on health. Sixty two on diabetic individual without chronic disease were randomly and equally assigned into control and intervention group. For diabetic group, 31 subjects were included. Blood cupping were done on subjects in the intervention and diabetic group, whereas individual in the control group were remained untreated. Assessments were done at baseline, first month, third month (before the second session of cupping) and fourth month for all participants. Results: In non diabetic and diabetic cupping group, there were significant reductions in fasting blood sugar (FBS) and all renal function parameters from baseline to the first, third and fourth month. The von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen also showed significant reduction at fourth month. At the end of the study, all the serum lipid profiles, FBS, serum urea and creatinine in cupping group were significantly differ as compared with control group. For serum HDL-C and LDL-C, the significant difference between cupping and control group were seen at the third and fourth month. Conclusions: Wet cupping therapy showed significant improvement in blood pressure and certain component of biochemical parameters, renal function parameters and also endothelial functions. Therefore, wet cupping could contribute in reducing and preventing the risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

Nutriconnect, Australia A comprehensive review to be presented which shows the plant kingdom as an almost inexhaustible reservoir of potential drugs. The longstanding, successful use of herbal drug combinations in traditional medicine makes it necessary to find a rationale for the pharmacological and therapeutic superiority of many of them in comparison to isolated single constituents. As a result, a new category \"Phytopharmaceutical\" has emerged in several countries. There are many definitions but the core essence is \"Phytopharmaceutical drug includes purified and standardized fraction with defined minimum four bio-active or phytochemical compounds (qualitatively and quantitatively assessed) of an extract of a medicinal plant or its part, for internal or external use of human beings or animals for diagnosis, treatment, mitigation or prevention of any disease or disorder but does not include administration by parental route\" (CDSCO, Govt of India, 2016). In last decade we have seen the sluggish growth of Herbal/Ayurvedic products and decrease in Pharma R&D output in terms of reduction in number of NCEs and increasing cost of new drug discovery. Current allopathic practice is unable to meet the unmet needs of multicomponent drug for multi target diseases. A number of problems, such as usefulness of RCTs in herbal medicine which are connected with the search for new prototype drugs of biological origin are also described. Special attention will be given on role of natural products in therapy; as biologically active compounds as such, as starting materials for (semi)synthetic drugs and also as source of inspiration or as models for the synthesis of new drugs with better therapeutic, chemical or physical properties than the original compounds.

Union Yoga Ayurveda, Singapore Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), the seventh leading cause of death, is a biggest challenge for mankind. Despite of fascinating advances in pharmaco-therapeutic agents, the prevalence of T2DM is growing every year. Complementary and Alternative medicine (CAM) as classified by National centre of CAM have documented various positive results of T2DM. Whole ancient medical systems like Ayurveda, Siddha and TCM etc use natural herbs either as a single drug therapy or in the form of formulations, depending upon principles of respective medical system. Studies done on various herbs and mind body intervention like yoga, acupuncture etc are found to be beneficial for T2DM. This resulted, large number of physicians either referring to or practicing some of the more prominent and well known forms of CAM. The concepts proposed and used by these CAM systems (that are kept alive by CAM practitioners for thousands of years) appear very mysterious to the present day biomedical practitioners. These models of therapies seem to have evolved through several phases of internal research just like the present day drug trials that go through 4 phases of intensive statistical evaluation. It appears that todays scientists need to follow the footsteps of research used by the ancient seers of TCM, Ayurveda, Siddha, Yoga or Homeopathy to unravel these mysterious theories. This review talks about generating evidence not only for the efficacy of these holistic systems but also in carrying out systematic research by biomedical scientist who have the knowledge of both the western and eastern sciences. Smt. Urmila Devi Ayurvedic College, India Heart, Brain and Kidney are considered the most vital part of our body. Disease to any of these organ is life threatening. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women and besides that it is also found in almost all type of ethnicities of the world. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common of all type of heart diseases killing about 3,70,000 people every year. The main risk factors of heart diseases are high blood pressure, high cholesterol and smoking. Some medical and lifestyle conditions like Diabetes mellitus, Obesity, alcohol consumption also increase the risk of heart diseases. Heart disease in Ayurveda is known as \"Hridroga\". According to Ayurveda heart disease are of five types according to predominance krimij (infestation of worms). As far as treatment is concerned modern can offer medication or surgeries according to condition of the patient which is both risky as well as costly. Ayurveda offers a non-surgical procedure in the form of lifestyle changes, Ayurvedic herbs like Arjun, Sthira and Panchkarma like Hrid Basti, Virechan which can help in the treatment of heart disease as well as risk associated with it.

Indian Institute of Naturopathy, India Naturopathy is an art & science of non-invasive healthcare & health assessment in which neither drugs nor surgery are used. Emphasis is given on five elements of Nature like Air, Water, Earth, Ether and Sunlight. Also the help of natural substances like fruits and Vegetables or their juices is taken for Eliminative, Curative and Preventive diets. Naturopathy believes that healing comes from within & body is capable of healing itself. Body Massage is playing a major role for toning of body muscles. Hippocrates, the father of Modern Medicine, formulated the basic Naturopathy concept. Naturopathy is first & foremost preventive system of medicine. Fruits and vegetables is one of the tried & true recommendations for a healthy diet. Eating plenty of fruits & vegetables can help you ward off stress, control blood pressure & cholesterol, prevent some types of cancer, avoid a painful intestinal ailment called diverticulitis. Body Massage-Our body is made up of flesh & bone, as well as spirit, all interconnected with the integrated & unifying brain & nervous system. The nervous system, structurally an elongation of the brain itself, extends from the base of the skull, through the vertebral canal & the openings of the vertebrae of the backbone, finally penetrating every gland, organ, muscle, bone & tissue, ending in the cells in remotest & deepest parts of our body, as well as our fingertips, toes & skin. Any muscles are tense; there is inevitably a reaction in greater or lesser degree, upon the entire nervous system. Thus Naturopathy and Massage play important role for healthy Body, Mind and Spirit. Biography: Dr. Prakash Kondekar currently is Director of Indian Institute of Naturopathy, India. He had conducted 18 Workshops, Health Management in UK, USA, Germany, Mauritius, Singapore, UAE, Vietnam, Austria, Italy & India.
