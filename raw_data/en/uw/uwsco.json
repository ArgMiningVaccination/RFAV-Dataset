Q: What are the details of the clinical study? A: The clinical study was conducted by Citrus Labs. Participants were followed for 16 days (days 6-21) after the detox period to investigate altered eating habits since completing the 5-day detox period. Q: Why did you change the 5-Day Detox? A: We added Grateful Gut to our 5-Day Detox to support your digestion and help you flush out the bad stuff, so you can feel healthier and more energized! Grateful Gut is a daily superfood mix containing natural prebiotics and digestive enzymes (from celery and Jerusalem artichoke) to help support a healthy microbiome and better gut health for smoother, more comfortable digestion. Q: What is a detox? A: A detox diet or cleanse is a healthy way to reset the body's systems. When you follow a detox diet, you're improving and optimizing the function of your body's own detoxification systems and supporting your body's health. You're also trying to give your body a break so it can heal itself. If it's constantly being occupied with digestion, which takes a lot of energy, your body will put the deep cleaning process on hold. Q: Can anyone follow the detox? A: In general, this detox is all about refueling your body with nutrients, which in most cases is healthy for everyone! However, if you are pregnant, breastfeeding or taking certain medications, please consult your doctor. Q: How does the 5 day detox work? A: Unlike most detox programs that focus on expensive juices or pills, this detox diet plan focuses on real, whole foods and nutrient-dense superfoods. This detox also eliminates meat, dairy, processed foods, caffeine, added sugar, salt, oils, additives and fillers. Breakfast is a green smoothie, lunch is a plant-based meal and dinner is a berry smoothie. You also have the option to have a snack in the afternoon. Q: What results can I expect from the Detox Plan? A: Results will vary from person to person. People who have followed this detox have experienced increased energy levels, better digestion, glowing skin, overall better mood, improved sleep, weight loss and reduced sugar cravings \u2014 just to name a few. Q: How do I get the Detox plan? A: A printed 5-Day Detox Plan is included with your order. After purchasing this bundle, you'll also receive an email with a link to download an electronic version of the 5-Day Detox Plan. Q: Do I get support during the Detox Plan? A: Yes! You'll receive support before, during and after the detox.
