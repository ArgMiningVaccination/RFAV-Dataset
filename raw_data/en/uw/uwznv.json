From our first meeting, she made me feel comfortable and heard. She is so warm and friendly and knows her stuff! I went in for some digestive issues as well as sinus headaches and stress and the first thing Dr.Tracie told me is that she will get to the bottom of my problems. It was so refreshing to receive help with fixing the problem rather than just bandaid for the problem. Dr.Tracie takes the time to explain her process and comes up with a plan that will fit her patient's needs. I never feel rushed when I am there and I always feel like my concerns are addressed. Top-notch! Over a few months time, she has helped me soooo much! When I first started my session, I was a ball of stress out nerves. Now I feel like my stress level is under control and I have a happier gut! The office is beautiful and calming and Zack always there to greet you with a warm smile while he asks about your day. I can't say enough great things about Deep Roots! If you need help with your digestion, stress, etc. then Deep Roots is the place for you! - 7/30/2019 Deep Roots Natural Medicine is the best! I love and value Tracie & Zach SO much. They deliver quality, holistic healing services that take into consideration the WHOLE BEING. Unlike other experiences I've had with medicine, being attended by Tracie was a dream! She is diligent and comprehensive during consultations, where like an investigator, she collects \"clues\" and works with the client to address their issues/needs. I went to DRNM with some digestive health issues, as well as overall energy and mood concerns. After a 3-month intensive treatment program of acupuncture, coaching, herbs and supplements, I can happily say that because of the care and support I received from Tracie and Zach, I feel incredible! I finally feel like the ME I'm supposed to be!! Give yourself the gift of healing, it is truly life changing. - 10/18/2018 I have been seeing Tracie for about 2 months now for post-operative nerve pain in my shoulder and arm. I regained full mobility of my arm after physical therapy but the nerve pain/ numbness persisted until I saw Tracie. I am so relieved (both physically and mentally) as I thought this issue would never be resolved. My friend recommended Tracie and I'm so happy I took his advice! She walks you through a treatment plan and makes you feel so comfortable and relaxed. I was new to acupuncture and Eastern medicine in general and have discovered all the benefits in such a short period of time. Now that the nerve pain has subsided a bit, we're focusing on other issues like stress and anxiety. I'm so excited to continue working with Tracie! - 3/30/2020 Deep Roots Natural Medicine and Tracie have really changed my life. I have suffered from chronic back pain for over ten years. I had tried everything short of surgery prior to seeing Tracie and nothing worked. About two years ago someone suggested acupuncture to me and thankfully I came across Deep Roots Natural Medicine. Almost immediately I knew I made the right decision. Tracie takes a whole health approach and combines that with acupuncture to treat you. After my first few sessions I started to notice a decrease in my daily back pain. Tracie helped me understand my muscles and the source of my pain which allowed me to avoid things that aggravated my back. Within a few months I had numerous pain free days and two years later I rarely have pain. I cannot recommend this place enough. - 5/14/2021 Dr. Tracie is amazing. After seeing her for approximately 2 months I feel better than I have in years. When my regular doctor told me there was nothing else they could do for me, Dr. Tracie came to the rescue. It has given me hope that I can feel better and can get better. Dr. Tracie is incredible. Business owner information Tracie H. 7/5/2021 Thank you for your review Heather. It's been exciting to see the transformation as you've improved. You've been an excellent patient, I'm happy to have the opportunity to work together. - 11/30/2018 I have been going to Tracie for over a year and have been working together over the last half of year on a wellness program. Tracie identified all of the different lab work and testing that would be needed in order for us to identify what the root cause could be for my symptoms and areas of concern. Once we received those results, Tracie put together a comprehensive plan of supplements, diet, and treatments. Over the course of the following months, I could feel the difference that our plan was having on my overall health and the follow-up lab work proved that to be the case. One of the main areas of concern was in relation to thyroid levels which have since been lowered by over half. For me, working with Tracie has been a great alternative to turning to pharmaceuticals for something that can be managed in a more natural and holistic approach. - 3/8/2018 I absolutely love Deep Roots. I saw it was new and had great reviews from previous patients so I thought I would give it a try for my neck and back pain! Tracie is amazing and has such a gift when it comes to healing with Oriental Medicine. She started me with acupuncture and cupping therapy together. She had me complete a full exam and afterwards sat down with me to go over all my answers so she could get a thorough understanding of what was going on. After my first session, as soon as I sat up, I felt so much tension relieved! If you're looking for somewhere to go for acupuncture and cupping, Tracie is the person to go to! Thank you Tracie! - 5/8/2018 Tracie is amazing! Not only is she super knowledgeable and skilled in all Deep Roots has to offer, but she's also caring and dedicated to the well being of her clients. Her holistic approach to healthy living physically, mentally, and nutritionally, ensures your treatment isn't just treatment, but also highly valuable education. Highly recommended! - 2/27/2018 Tracie is very knowledgeable all I had to do was describe the symptoms and she created the right treatment plan. - 10/17/2017 Tracie is absolutely wonderful. I went to my previous acupuncturist for 5 years and found Tracie via referral. She is absolutely wonderful! The space is clean and relaxing. I originally came to continue acupuncture, but have since found cupping to be equally as wonderful! I typically do a hybrid treatment of acupuncture and cupping. For those new to acupuncture, or those looking for a great practitioner, Tracie is absolutely the one! Prices are fair and setting up appointments is very easy. I typically go 1-2 times a month and think it has been incredibly beneficial to my overall well being. Thank you so much Tracie!
