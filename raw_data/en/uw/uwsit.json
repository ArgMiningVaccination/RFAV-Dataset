Unlike many drugs, it is non-toxic, and adverse reactions are minimal. This is probably one of the chief reasons why acupuncture is very popular in the treatment of chronic pain in many countries. Even if the effect of acupuncture therapy is less potent than that of conventional treatments, acupuncture may still be worth considering due to the toxicity or adverse effects of conventional treatments. Some people are concerned about the reuse of acupuncture needles. However, qualified practitioners use only sterilized single-use needles that are disposed after the treatment. "}
