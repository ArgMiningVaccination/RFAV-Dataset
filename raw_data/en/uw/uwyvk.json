Radical Remission: Defying the Odds and Unlocking the Secrets of Healing This extraordinary book by Dr Kelly A Turner, explores the fascinating world of healing and defying the odds against serious illnesses. \"Radical Remission\" is an eye-opening book that challenges conventional beliefs about healing and presents inspiring stories of individuals who triumphed over life-threatening illnesses including cancer. This work is the result of the author's extensive research examining over 1,000 cases where individuals unexpectedly overcame incurable diseases which uncovered nine common factors that these survivors incorporated into their healing journeys. By highlighting the nine key factors found in these radical remission cases, Kelly Turner offers a roadmap for those seeking a comprehensive approach to their healing journeys. 1. Mindset Matters: One of the critical elements shared by these survivors is having a positive mindset. Believing in their ability to heal and maintaining a hopeful outlook played a significant role in their recoveries. 2. Taking Control of Your Health: Radical remission cases often involve individuals who became actively engaged in their healing process. They took charge of their health by seeking out alternative therapies, making lifestyle changes, and actively participating in their treatment decisions. 3. Diet and Nutrition: Turner emphasizes the importance of nourishing our bodies with a healthy diet. She found that incorporating more fruits and vegetables, reducing processed foods, and adopting an anti-inflammatory approach played a crucial role in these survivors' recoveries. 4. The Role of Stress Reduction: Chronic stress can have a profound impact on our well-being. The survivors in Turner's study acknowledged the significance of reducing stress levels through practices such as meditation, yoga, and other stress-management techniques. 5. Tapping into the Power of Intuition: Trusting one's intuition and listening to the body's signals emerged as a vital factor in radical remission cases. Individuals who paid attention to their instincts and made choices aligned with their inner guidance experienced positive outcomes. 6. Embracing Social Support: Strong social connections proved to be a powerful healing force. Turner found that individuals who built a supportive network of family, friends, and community experienced improved well-being and resilience throughout their healing journeys. 7. Unleashing Emotional Healing: Acknowledging and addressing emotional wounds played a crucial role in the radical remission process. Survivors who embraced forgiveness, released negative emotions, and cultivated a sense of inner peace found healing on multiple levels. 8. The Role of Spiritual Connection: Regardless of religious affiliation, a spiritual connection seemed to contribute significantly to healing. Nurturing a sense of purpose, connecting with something greater than oneself, and engaging in spiritual practices provided profound healing experiences for these survivors. 9. Having Strong Reasons for Living: When individuals were driven by compelling reasons to live, such as cherished relationships, dreams, or unfinished goals, they tapped into an inner strength that seemed to fuel their resilience. These reasons became beacons of hope, guiding them through the challenging treatments, setbacks, and uncertainties that accompany the healing journey. This book is essentially a testament to one of the fundamental principles of naturopathy: one's own will, determination and faith are integral components of healing. However, this book is not about dismissing conventional medicine but rather about complementing it with an integrative approach that encompasses the mind, body, and spirit. So, if you're intrigued by the power of the human mind and healing potential, \"Radical Remission\" is a must-read for you. The Autoimmune Solution: A Path to Healing and Reclaiming Your Health Another book that has been making waves in the wellness community is \"The Autoimmune Solution\" by Dr. Amy Myers. If you've ever been perplexed by the intimidating subject of autoimmune diseases, this could be the game-changing resource you've been looking for. Dr. Myers, a renowned functional medicine physician, dives deep into the world of autoimmune diseases in her book. She understands the frustration and despair that can come with these conditions, as she herself battled and overcame her own autoimmune disorder. Drawing from personal experience and her expertise in functional medicine, she presents a comprehensive strategy for addressing and healing autoimmune conditions. So, what exactly is an autoimmune disease? Well, it's a situation where your body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own healthy cells, tissues, and organs. This can lead to a wide range of health problems, from rheumatoid arthritis and lupus to Hashimoto's thyroiditis and multiple sclerosis. The autoimmune epidemic affects millions of people worldwide, and conventional medicine often falls short in providing effective solutions. In \"The Autoimmune Solution,\" Dr. Myers unveils her groundbreaking four-pillar approach to combatting autoimmune diseases. Let's take a closer look at each pillar: 1. Heal Your Gut: Dr. Myers highlights the crucial role that gut health plays in autoimmune disorders. She explains how a leaky gut (increased intestinal permeability) can trigger an immune response, leading to the development of autoimmune conditions. The book offers practical strategies to restore gut health, including an elimination diet, targeted supplementation, and lifestyle changes. 2. Get Rid of Gluten and Other Reactive Foods: Gluten, along with other common food sensitivities, can exacerbate autoimmune symptoms and perpetuate inflammation. Dr. Myers provides guidance on identifying and eliminating these trigger foods from your diet, promoting healing and reducing immune system reactivity. 3. Tame the Toxins: Environmental toxins can burden the immune system and contribute to autoimmune flare-ups. \"The Autoimmune Solution\" educates readers on the toxins lurking in our everyday lives and offers strategies to minimize exposure and support detoxification. 4. Heal Infections and Relieve Stress: Chronic infections and unmanaged stress can wreak havoc on the immune system. Dr. Myers explains how addressing these factors is crucial for reducing autoimmune symptoms and achieving long-term healing. Throughout the book, Dr. Myers presents real-life case studies, practical tips, and easy-to-follow action steps. Her compassionate and conversational writing style makes complex medical concepts accessible to anyone seeking answers and relief from autoimmune disorders. \"The Autoimmune Solution\" empowers readers to take charge of their health journey. It encourages a proactive approach, helping individuals become advocates for their well-being and providing them with the tools to work in partnership with their healthcare providers. This is aligned with the naturopathic paradigm of being a patient-centered approach. Grain Brain: Understanding the Impact of Carbs on Your Brain Health Let's dive into the fascinating world of \"Grain Brain\" by Dr. David Perlmutter. This groundbreaking book explores the impact of carbohydrates on our brain health and unveils a thought-provoking perspective on nutrition and overall well-being. Dr. Perlmutter, a renowned neurologist, challenges conventional wisdom regarding our diets and their effect on our brains. In \"Grain Brain,\" he highlights the alarming rise in brain disorders such as dementia, ADHD, depression, and even chronic headaches. He argues that many of these conditions are linked to our consumption of grains and other carbohydrates. The central theme of the book revolves around the detrimental effects of gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. Dr. Perlmutter posits that gluten sensitivity can manifest not only as gastrointestinal issues but also as neurological disorders. He supports this claim with an impressive array of scientific studies, personal anecdotes, and patient testimonials. The book also delves into the concept of ketosis, a metabolic state in which the body primarily uses ketones (produced from fat) instead of glucose (from carbohydrates) for fuel. Dr. Perlmutter explains how adopting a low-carb, high-fat ketogenic diet can have profound benefits for brain health. He outlines the connection between excessive carbohydrate intake and inflammation, oxidative stress, and the production of harmful free radicals\u2014all of which can contribute to cognitive decline. One of the most eye-opening aspects of \"Grain Brain\" is the exploration of how our modern diets, heavily reliant on processed grains and sugars, have deviated from what our ancestors consumed. Dr. Perlmutter emphasizes the importance of returning to a diet rich in whole, unprocessed foods, healthy fats, and an abundance of vegetables to promote optimal brain function and overall vitality. While \"Grain Brain\" presents a compelling case against grains and carbohydrates, it's important to note that individual experiences may vary. The book offers valuable insights and raises important questions about our dietary choices, encouraging readers to be more mindful of what they consume and how it may impact their brain health. Mind over medicine: Harnessing the Healing Power Within In the captivating book 'Mind Over Medicine' by Lissa Rankin, she takes us on a transformative journey that explores the profound connection between mind and body. Rankin delves into the mind's influence on our physical health, shedding light on the interconnectedness between our mental and bodily states, challenging conventional beliefs about health and healing. Drawing from scientific research, personal anecdotes and compelling case studies, the book delves into topics such as the placebo effect, the impact of stress on the body, and the potential for self-healing. By recognizing the integral role our thoughts, beliefs, and emotions play in our overall well-being, 'Mind Over Medicine' offers a compelling invitation to embrace the transformative power of mind-body medicine and harness it for our own healing and wellness. She takes us on an eye-opening adventure, uncovering the astonishing ways our thoughts, beliefs, and emotions impact our physical well-being. 'Mind Over Medicine' urges us to tap into the innate healing power within, highlighting the potential for self-healing when we align our minds and bodies in harmony. Naturopathy has always emphasized the impact of body's own healing potential and providing supportive care to enable it. However, Rankin posits that physicians are often unaware of the fact that this healing mechanism is essentially turned off during the stress response. When the mind and body are in a state of stress and arousal, healing, repair and maintenance take a backseat. Therefore, she emphasizes the role of stress management in healing. Rankin's empowering message resonates deeply, inviting us to reimagine the role of thoughts and emotions in the pursuit of optimal health and well-being.
