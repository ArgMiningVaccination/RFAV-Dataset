Graduate of the Academy for Guided Imagery with Martin Rossman MD - Student of John Wellwood, Ph.D. author of Healing Power of Unconditional Presence Though I've learned much over the years spent with Dr. Epstein, the most valuable gift he has given me is that of awareness. Having awareness is exhilarating, devastating, enlightening, fear-inducing, and fear-conquering. Awareness is the key to understanding the parts of you that are in the lead and the parts that are in hiding. Learning, as Dr. E puts it, 'how you came to be this way', leads you on a path toward balancing those parts...and with that balance comes further awareness and healing. While no one patient's healing recipe is the same, I used no drugs, no supplements, and no surgeries to overcome chronic sinusitis, constant headaches, and a years-long pain in my side that flummoxed doctors, surgeons, acupuncturists, and psychiatrists. Only by treating the Mind and the Body as a whole was I able to truly heal. Thank you, Dr. Epstein, for helping to open my eyes - to bring awareness - and for the healing that continues to come.
