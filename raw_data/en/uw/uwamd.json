Feeding your body certain foods may help keep your [immune system](/health/cold-flu/fun-facts) strong. If you're looking for ways to prevent colds, the flu, and other infections, your first step should be a visit to your local grocery store. Plan your meals to include these 15 powerful immune system boosters. Important note No supplement will cure or prevent disease, and no supplement or diet can protect you from COVID-19. Currently, no research supports the use of any supplement to protect against COVID-19 specifically. Food Fix: Immune System Boost Most people turn straight to [vitamin C](/nutrition/does-vitamin-c-help-with-colds) after they've caught a cold. That's because it helps build up your immune system. Vitamin C is thought to increase the production of [white blood cells](/health/wbc-count/), which are key to fighting infections. Most [citrus fruits](/nutrition/citrus-fruit-benefits) are high in vitamin C. With such a variety to choose from, it's easy to add a squeeze of this vitamin to any meal. Popular citrus fruits include: Because your body doesn't produce or store it, you [need daily vitamin C](/nutrition/how-much-vitamin-c-should-i-take-daily) for continued health. The [recommended daily amount](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-Consumer) - 75 mg for women - 90 mg for men If you opt for supplements, avoid taking more than 2,000 milligrams (mg) a day. Also keep in mind that while vitamin C might help you recover from a cold quicker, there's [no evidence yet](/nutrition/vitamin-c-coronavirus) that it's effective against [COVID-19](/health/coronavirus-covid-19). Ounce for ounce, red [bell peppers](/nutrition/foods/bell-peppers) contain almost 3 times as much vitamin C ( [127 mg](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/170108/nutrients) [45 mg](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/169918/nutrients) [beta-carotene](/health/beta-carotene-benefits). Besides boosting your immune vitamin C may help you [maintain healthy skin](/health/4-best-vitamins-for-skin). Beta-carotene, which your body converts into [vitamin A](/nutrition/vitamin-a), helps keep your eyes and skin healthy. [Broccoli](/nutrition/benefits-of-broccoli) is supercharged with vitamins and minerals. Packed with vitamins A, C, and E, as well as [fiber](/nutrition/why-is-fiber-good-for-you) and many other [antioxidants](/nutrition/antioxidants-explained), broccoli is one of the healthiest vegetables you can put on your plate. The key to keeping its power intact is to cook it as little as possible \u2014 or better yet, not at all. [Research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36299246/) [steaming](/nutrition/cooking-nutrient-content#steaming) or microwaving are the best ways to keep more nutrients in the food. [Garlic](/nutrition/11-proven-health-benefits-of-garlic) adds flavor to food and has long been used for medicinal purposes. Early civilizations recognized its value in fighting infections. Garlic may also slow down hardening of the arteries, and [people use it](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/garlic) Garlic's [immune-boosting properties](/nutrition/garlic-fights-colds-and-flu) seem to come from a heavy concentration of sulfur-containing compounds, such as allicin. [Ginger](/nutrition/11-proven-benefits-of-ginger) is another ingredient many turn to after getting sick. [Ginger](/health/food-nutrition/ginger-breakfast/) may help decrease inflammation, which can help reduce a [sore throat](/health/sore-throat) and inflammatory illnesses. It may also help with [nausea](/health/nausea). While it's used in many sweet desserts, ginger packs some heat in the form of gingerol, [a relative](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31022566/) properties](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29747751/) [Spinach](/nutrition/foods/spinach) made our list not just because it's rich in vitamin C \u2014 it's also packed with numerous antioxidants and beta-carotene, which may both increase the infection-fighting ability of our immune systems. Similar to broccoli, spinach is healthiest when [cooked as little as possible](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6049644/) [oxalic acid](/nutrition/oxalate-good-or-bad), an [antinutrient](/nutrition/how-to-reduce-antinutrients/). Look for [yogurts](/nutrition/foods/yogurt) that have the phrase \"live and active cultures\" printed on the label, like [Greek yogurt](/health/food-nutrition/greek-yogurt-benefits). These cultures may stimulate your immune system to help fight diseases. Try to get plain yogurts rather than the kind that are flavored and loaded with sugar. You can sweeten plain yogurt yourself with healthy fruits and a drizzle of [honey](/nutrition/10-benefits-of-honey) instead. Yogurt can also be a great source of [vitamin D](/nutrition/vitamin-d-101), so try to select brands fortified with this vitamin. Vitamin D helps regulate the immune system and is thought to boost our body's natural defenses against diseases. [Clinical trials](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12040988) are even in the works to study [its possible effects on COVID-19](/nutrition/vitamin-d-coronavirus). [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8937591/) When it comes to preventing and fighting off colds, [vitamin E](/health/all-about-vitamin-e) tends to take a backseat to vitamin C. However, this powerful antioxidant is key to a healthy immune system. It's a fat-soluble vitamin, which means it requires the presence of fat to be absorbed properly. Nuts, such as [almonds](/nutrition/9-proven-benefits-of-almonds), are packed with the vitamin and also have [healthy fats](/health/food-nutrition/healthy-fats-guidelines/). Adults only need about [15 mg](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminE-Consumer) [around seeds are full of nutrients, including [phosphorous](/health/how-your-body-uses-phosphorus), [magnesium](/nutrition/10-proven-magnesium-benefits), and vitamins B6 and E. Vitamin E is important in regulating and maintaining immune system function. Other foods with high amounts of vitamin E include [avocados](/nutrition/12-proven-benefits-of-avocado) and dark [leafy greens](/nutrition/leafy-green-vegetables). Sunflower seeds are also high in [selenium](/health/selenium-foods/). Just 1 ounce contains [nearly half](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/169417/nutrients) [selenium](/health/selenium-foods/) that the average adult needs daily. A variety of [studies](https://doi.org/10.3945/an.114.007575), mostly performed on animals, have looked at its potential to combat [viral](/health/bacterial-vs-viral-infections/) infections such as [swine flu (H1N1)](/health/swine-flu). You may know [turmeric](/nutrition/top-10-evidence-based-health-benefits-of-turmeric) as a key ingredient in many curries. This bright yellow, bitter spice has also been used for years as an anti-inflammatory in treating both [osteoarthritis](/health/osteoarthritis/natural-home-remedies) and [rheumatoid arthritis](/health/rheumatoid-arthritis/rheumatoid-arthritis-turmeric). [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4802396) [curcumin](/nutrition/top-10-evidence-based-health-benefits-of-turmeric/), which gives turmeric its distinctive color, can help decrease exercise-induced muscle damage. [Curcumin](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/turmeric-vs-curcumin/) has promise as an immune booster (based on findings from [animal studies](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/23/11/2778/htm)) with [antimicrobial properties](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7408453/) Both [green and black teas](/nutrition/green-tea-vs-black-tea) with [flavonoids](/health/what-are-flavonoids-everything-you-need-to-know/), a type of antioxidant. Where [green tea](/nutrition/top-10-evidence-based-health-benefits-of-green-tea) really excels is in its epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), another powerful antioxidant. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7367004/) [fermentation](/nutrition/fermentation/) process black tea goes through destroys a lot of the EGCG. Green tea, on the other hand, is steamed and not fermented, so the EGCG is preserved. One small [papaya](/health/food-nutrition/health-benefits-of-papaya) contains [100%](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/169926/nutrients) [Papayas](/nutrition/8-proven-papaya-benefits/) also have a [digestive enzyme](/nutrition/natural-digestive-enzymes/) called [papain](/health/food-nutrition/papain/) that anti-inflammatory effects. Papayas have decent amounts of [potassium](/health/potassium), magnesium, and [folate](/nutrition/folic-acid-vs-folate), all of which are beneficial to your overall health. Like papayas, [kiwis](/health/7-best-things-about-kiwi) are a rich source of essential nutrients, including folate, potassium, [vitamin K](/health/foods-high-in-vitamin-k), and vitamin C. Vitamin C boosts the white blood cells to fight infection, while kiwi's other nutrients keep the rest of your body functioning properly. When you're sick, and you reach for [chicken](/nutrition/is-chicken-good-for-you/) soup, it's more than just [the placebo effect](https://www.healthline.com/health/placebo-effect/) that makes you feel better. The soup may help lower inflammation, which could improve symptoms of a cold. Poultry, such as chicken and turkey, is high in [vitamin B6](/nutrition/vitamin-b6-benefits). About 3 ounces of light turkey or chicken meat contains [nearly one-third](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB6-HealthProfessional/) Vitamin B6 is an important player in many of the chemical reactions that happen in the body. It's also vital to the formation of new and healthy [red blood cells](/health/rbc-count). [Stock or broth](/nutrition/stock-vs-broth) made by boiling chicken bones contains [gelatin](/nutrition/gelatin-benefits/), chondroitin, and other nutrients helpful for gut healing and immunity. [Shellfish](/nutrition/shellfish) isn't what jumps to mind for many who are trying to boost their immune system, but some types of shellfish provide [zinc](/nutrition/zinc), a nutrient that supports immune function. Varieties of shellfish that are high in zinc include: - oysters - crab - lobster - mussels Keep in mind that you don't want to have more than the [daily recommended amount](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Zinc-Consumer) - 11 mg for adult men - 8 mg for most adult women [Too much zinc](/nutrition/zinc-overdose-symptoms) can actually inhibit immune system function. How can I boost my immune system quickly? There is no instant way to boost your immune system, but the sooner you get started with the [following tips](https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpao/features/enhance-immunity/index.html) - eating a healthy, varied diet with plenty of fresh foods and whole grains - exercise - manage your weight - get enough sleep - avoid or quit smoking - limit alcohol consumption What foods help fight infections? Some foods will boost your immune system while others have antimicrobial properties, which means they may help fight bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. Examples [include](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6963522/) [oregano](/nutrition/6-oregano-benefits/), [cinnamon](/health/food-nutrition/cinnamon-health-benefits/), and [rutabaga](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/rutabagas/), citrus fruits, [parsley](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/parsley-benefits/), and a wide range of other plant-based foods also contain nutrients that appear to have antimicrobial properties. What vegetables are good for the immune system? Red peppers, spinach, broccoli are good choices, as well as those that add flavor, such as ginger, turmeric, and garlic. Can bananas boost your immune system? Bananas contain a substance called banana [lectin](/nutrition/foods-high-in-lectins/). One [mouse study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27106589/) Fresh foods can provide our bodies with nutrients our immune system needs to work correctly. You need a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, herbs, and spices in your diet to enable your body to stay as healthy as possible. Good choices of foods to boost the immune system include citrus fruits, spinach, almonds, papaya, and green tea. It's worth remembering though, that diet alone can't keep us healthy. It's also essential to exercise, [maintain a moderate weight](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-should-i-weigh/), and avoid harmful habits such as [smoking](https://www.healthline.com/health/smoking/effects-on-body) and a high [alcohol](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/alcohol-good-or-bad) intake.
