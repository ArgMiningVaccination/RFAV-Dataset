Careful compliance with established hygienepractices by healthcare workers together with effective antiseptic options is essential for the protection of patients from infectious agents.For over 60 years, povidone iodine (PVP-I) for- mulations have been shown to limit the impact and spread of infectious diseases with potentantiviral, antibacterial and antifungal effects. In addition to a lack of reported resistance, the benets of PVP-I include an excellent safetyprole and a broad spectrum of effect due to its multimodal action. Studies have shown that hand washing with PVP-I-based antiseptics iseffective for the decontamination of skin, while PVP-I mouthwashes and gargles signicantly reduce viral load in the oral cavity and theoropharynx. The importance of PVP-I has been emphasised by its inclusion in the World Health Organization's list of essential medicines, andhigh potency for virucidal activity has beenobserved against viruses of signicant globalconcern, including hepatitis A and influenza, as well as the Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome and Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome coro-naviruses. Together with its diverse applications in antimicrobial control, broad accessibility across the globe, and outstanding safety andtolerability prole, PVP-I offers an affordable, potent, and widely available antiseptic option.

M. Eggers ( 8:581-593 https://doi.org/10.1007/s40121-019-00260-xBACKGROUND The importance of robust infection prevention practices has been highlighted recently withreports of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) emerging in hospitals in Switzerland [ 1], Australia [ 2] and New Zealand [ 3]. Recently, an Australian study has shown that Enterococci faecium , the microorganism responsible for various nosocomial infections, was behind over 30% of enterococcal bacteremia cases surveyed in the country [ 4]. It was found that 90% of these were ampicillin-resistant CC17 strains, while 50% were also vancomycin-resistant. Other evidence suggests that some E. faecium strains may be expressing limited resistance to alcohol-based sanitisers, although at concen- trations signicantly lower than is recom- mended for use in hospital settings [ 5]. The continuing spread of antibiotic resistance is an area of signicant concern and necessitates the careful consideration of more rigorous man-agement practices, as well as the assessment of alternative antiseptics for broad hygiene applications. Povidone iodine (PVP-I) is a widely-available alternative antiseptic to alcohol that is com-monly used in clinical settings, including forskin disinfection before and after surgery. It is usually applied to the skin as a liquid or a powder and can be used to treat current infec- tions and prevent the spread of opportunistic pathogens. PVP-I has a broad antimicrobialspectrum and is active against a plethora of viruses and antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains (Table 1). Susceptible Gram-negative bacteriainclude Klebsiella pneumoniae , a common pathogen in hospitals, susceptible Gram-positive bacteria include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli .I n addition, PVP-I has been shown to be superior to chlorhexidine in hand washing studies comparing efcacy against bacteria and viruses (Table 2). PVP-I formulations rst became available in 1955, and the active ingredient is listed on theWorld Health Organization's (WHO) List ofEssential Medicines, a list of the most important medicines necessary for any functional health- care system. PVP-I is available over the counterand is often used as a broad-spectrum topical antiseptic treatment for minor cuts, burns, and abrasions, as well as in surgical operating the-atres. Widespread use in diverse clinical and non-clinical settings over recent decades has made the numerous advantages of PVP-I for-mulations more apparent. In addition to a broad-spectrum effect and excellent safety pro- le, active iodine has various properties that canaid in wound healing, with a strong evidence- based rationale existing for the application of PVP-I in treating infected wounds. The Euro-pean Wound Management Association has published a position paper that acknowledges the broad spectrum of PVP-I activity againstbacteria, viruses, fungi and endospores [ 6]. In contrast to other antiseptics, signicant resis-tance or cross-resistance has not been observedfor iodine, likely due to the various mechanisms through which iodine elicits its effects. It has thus found diverse applications in healthcare as a sterilising agent for pre- and post-operative Table 1 Comparison of antimicrobial activities of common antiseptic classes [ 12,13] Antiseptic type Inactivates Bacteria Bacterial spores Enveloped viruses Non-enveloped viruses Quaternary ammonium ?? -- Chlorine ?

The formulations are typically manufactured with concentrations of 7.5-10% PVP-I in solution, with oral formulationsincluding 1% oral gargle, in addition to surgical scrubs, ointments, and swabs. Preclinical and clinical safety and efcacy data show that PVP-I exhibits characteristics that are well-suited to wound-healing scenarios,including efcacy against biolms, good toler- ability and some degree of anti-inflammatory effect [ 7,8]. Of clinical relevance, healing in clean wounds is not suppressed by PVP-I, while it is supported in wounds that are colonised by microorganisms. It is particularly useful for thetreatment of sensitive wounds and those where an extended duration of therapy is needed. Medicated gauzes are now widely available,making the formulations easier to apply [ 9]. PVP-I also elicits potent antiviral activity, with commercially available formulationsshown to be more effective in terms of viral reduction than alcoholic and non-alcoholic sanitisers, as well as antimicrobial soaps [ 10]. Alcohol is a widely used antiseptic likely due to its affordability and relative ease of manufac- ture, but has been shown to be less effectivethan PVP-I at killing microorganisms [ 11]. Compliance with Ethics Guidelines This article is based on previously conducted studies anddoes not contain any studies with human par- ticipants or animals performed by any of the authors.MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF PVP-I PVP-1 refers to an iodine preparation com-monly used in both household and healthcare settings. It consists of a complex of povidone, hydrogen iodide, and elemental iodine whichtargets structures critical to the survival and replication of microorganisms. Common for- mulations typically consist of a 10% PVP-Isolution containing 1% available iodine. Following application, elemental iodine can take on several forms in aqueous solution, withthe molecular I 2and hypoiodous acid (HOI) being the most effective in terms of antimicro-bial activity [ 16]. The iodine molecules are free to oxidise vital pathogen structures such as amino acids, nucleic acids and membrane components. An equilibrium is achieved insuch circumstances, with more PVP-bound iodine released into solution to replace the iodine that is consumed by germicidal activity.The maintenance of this equilibrium ensures long-lasting efcacy during bouts of microor- ganism proliferation, as well as better tolerabil-ity for patients due to lower levels of irritation. Electron microscopy and biochemical observa- tions support the hypothesis that PVP-I disruptsmicrobial cell walls by inducing pore formation, leading to cytosol leakage [ 17]. The lack of reported resistance to PVP-I to date is thought to be due to the sheer diversity of susceptible targets within each pathogen, an important aspect to be considered in the face of risingconcerns for antibiotic resistance.Table 2 Data from direct comparisons of antimicrobial activities of common antiseptics in hand washing studies [ Antiseptic type Bacterial Escherichia coli Murine ??? ?

Indeed, studies have shown that approximately 42% of S. aureus isolates in Europe and Japan harbour genes that enable resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds and chlorhexidine, with chlorhex- idine overuse thought to be a factor in emergingresistance in some strains of Gram-negative bacteria [ 18,19]. The prevalence of methicillin resistance harboured by strains of S. aureus capable of causing bloodstream infectionbetween 1990 and the early 2000s in the UK rose signicantly from 2 to [40%, with mean overall rates of bacteraemia involving MRSA ranging from 0.10 to 0.19 per 1000 occupied beds [ 7]. The overuse of antibiotics is thought to be a contributing factor towards rising antibi-otic resistance, and is now being discouraged infavour of the wider usage of antiseptics, to which it is more difcult for bacteria to develop resistance [ 7]. While evidence of cross-resistance to antiseptics and antibiotics has been docu-mented for many agents, in over a century ofuse, no signicant acquired resistance or cross- resistance has been reported for iodine when used for specic indications [ 20]. This striking lack of resistance is thought to be due to the diverse mechanisms through which iodine simultaneously exerts its effects. Although someaspects remain to be fully understood, iodine's microbicidal activity is known to involve the oxidation of bacterial cell components, includ-ing amino/fatty acids, nucleotides, lipids in the cell membrane, and enzymes in the cytosol, ultimately promoting their denaturation anddeactivation [ 16]. More specically, the multi- modal action of iodine is known to arise fromthe potent oxidation of NH-, OH-, nucleotides fatty acids, and the emergence of resis- tance is likely to be prevented by the sheerdiversity of targets affected. Such effectseventually result in the simultaneous inactiva-tion of bacterial enzymes, a loss of genomeintegrity, and cell wall damage, overwhelming the microorganism's repair mechanisms. In a hallmark study, the development of bacterial resistance to iodine was investigatedby serial passage of two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa , two strains of Escherichia coli , two Klebsiella aerogenes , and one strain of Serratia marcescens in the presence of sub-opti- mal concentrations of iodine that were insuf- cient to cause cell death [ 21]. The investigators found that, after 20 passages, nodetectable change was observed in the minimalinhibitory concentration of iodine needed, nor the time taken until cell death occurred between the parent strain and the passagedsubcultures when exposed to efcacious con- centrations of iodine. The PVP-I formulation containing up to 1% available iodine was ableto kill all strains tested in under 5 min, with most cells being destroyed within 30 s. While dilute concentrations were noted to take inexcess of 10 min to achieve an effect, even these iodine dilutions were successful in killing all strains upon prolonged exposure. In real-worldscenarios, over-the-counter PVP-I formulations are accommodating of such prolonged exposure to healthy skin, with some commercial formu-lations known to be active for 12-14 h, com- pared to the 1-4 h of activity documented for chlorhexidine against fungi and endospores. Ofparticular note, clinical isolates of dine-resistant Klebsiella also beenidentied [ 22]. While chlorhexidine is com- monly used in disinfectants, these new ndings suggest that exposure to chlorhexidine is asso- ciated with stable resistance to colistin, an antibiotic of last resort for multidrug-resistantinfections. PVP-I IN ANTIVIRAL APPLICATIONS Various experimental models have been devel- oped to examine the antiviral properties of particular agents, with testing recommended tobe taken in a stepwise approach. The European Committee of Standardization (CEN)584 Infect Dis Ther (2019) 8:581-593recommends that the rst phase involve an in vitro suspension test with enveloped viruses(representing the bulk of emerging infectious disease threats). Phase 2 involves similar con- ditions, but with non-enveloped viruses, whilethe third and nal phase involves human hands in a simulation study. In addition to a virucidal hand test, variations on the latter step caninclude a quantitative non-porous surface test without mechanical action, a quantitative car- rier test, and a so-called 4-eld test involvingsurface disinfection with mechanical action (Fig. 1). Similarly, the US Center for Disease Control recommends a standardised method simulatinghand washing with the antiseptic formula to be tested to determine efcacy in reducing handmicroflora [ 23]. New test models have enabled the assessment of PVP-I formulations againsthighly infective and dangerous pathogens thatmay not be possible to test in vivo due to clin- ical risks and ethical considerations. Various commercially available formulations haveachieved the standards of the latest European guidelines (EN 14476 and EN 1499), with ef- cacy demonstrated in both Enveloped VirusTest Model (MVA) and Non-Enveloped VirusTest Model (MNV). The use of such modelviruses can provide valuable data for informeddecision-making during public health crises. EN 14476 is a standardised inactivation assay that involves a virus suspension, an interferingsubstance (such as bovine serum albumin), and the substance to be tested [ 24]. A virus control mixture is used to compare the effects of the antiviral product following a specied contact time (e.g. 15, 30 or 60 s), with virucidal activity calculated by determining the difference inlogarithmic titre between the virus control and the test virus cultures. The assessment of microbicidal efcacy can be challenging, due to the difculties in directobservation and the sheer numbers of cells or particles involved. Consensus within the medi-cal community has settled upon a minimum measure required to evaluate microbicidal ef- cacy, referred to as the log 10reduction factor. This is a mathematical term measured by titra- tion at the endpoint and indicates the reduction in the number of living or viable microbes aftertreatments such as sanitisation, disinfection, or cleaning. European Standards (EN) stipulate a minimum level of C4 log 10reduction in titre for viruses and fungi, and a C5 log 10reduction Fig. 1 Stepwise approach according to the European Committee of Standardization (CEN). Hand disinfection tests highlighted in green . Stepwise approach as proposed atthe 2nd International Meeting on Respiratory Pathogens(IMRP) held in Singapore on March 9, 2018 (see: https:// www.isirv.org )Infect Dis Ther (2019) 8:581-593 585for bacteria, representing reductions in the absolute number of microbes by 99.99% and99.999%, respectively (Table 3). The introduction and use of model viruses has signicantly aided in the investigation ofnew anti-virucidal agents, particularly during times of pressing need. For example, in December 2013, the Ebola virus was rst dis-covered in Guinea, and rapidly became one of the most complex epidemics in recent history. Due to its high biosecurity level, research intovaccines and containment measures for the virus was highly limited. Although yet to be conrmed as a surrogate for Ebola virus, themodied vaccinia virus (MVA) was introduced in 2014 with a reference claim against ''en- veloped viruses for hygienic hand rub and handwash'' [ 10]. Such models allow for reasonable progress to be made in comparing antiviralagents in certain settings. Similarly, Middle EastRespiratory Syndrome (MERS) was rst discov- ered in 2012, with the virus now having infec- ted more than 1300 victims in 26 countries,resulting in more than 480 deaths. Transmis- sion is known to frequently occur in healthcare settings, highlighting the need for suit-able models to test containment measures. The modied vaccinia virus, Ankara, has been used as a test model for MERS, with similar structuralfeatures and cultivation measures [ 24]. The influenza virus has been responsible for some of the most signicant epidemics in themodern world, with annual outbreaks resulting in approximately 3-5 million cases of severe illness and between 250,000 and 500,000 deaths per year [ 25]. An influenza study using plaque inhibition assays showed that a 1.56-mg/ml PVP-I treatment can inhibit infections in MDCKcells by human (eight strains) and avian (vestrains) influenza A viruses, including H1N1,H3N2, H5N3 and H9N2, from 23 to 98%. Receptor binding analysis revealed that haemagglutinin inhibition was the likely causeof the PVP-I virucidal activity, rather than the inhibition of host-specic sialic acid receptors. The nding also demonstrates two specicmechanisms of reduction of viral growth, namely, PVP-I blockade of viral attachment to the host cell receptors and the inhibition ofviral release from infected cells [ 26]. PVP-I formulations are also known to have broad antiviral properties. These effects aremechanistically similar in principle to iodine's antibacterial activity. For example, the virucidal mechanisms of action of PVP-I have beendetermined to involve the inhibition of essen- tial viral enzymes such as neuraminidase. The inactivation of this enzyme blocks viral releasefrom the host cell, preventing further spread of the virus to uninfected cells. In addition, PVP-I also inhibits viral haemagglutinin, resulting inthe blockade of attachment to host cell recep- tors. By simultaneously targeting both critical aspects of the viral machinery needed forreplication, PVP-I reduces the likelihood of resistance emerging through sudden mutation. Under such guidelines, PVP-I formulations have been shown to elicit viral inactivationof[99.99% in test systems using a modied vaccinia virus [ 24]. Virucidal efcacy has in some cases been determined to occur within15 s of contact. Following a hand simulation study with the murine norovirus, it was found that hand washing with PVP-I was more effec- tive than chlorhexidine and soft soap, a goldstandard recommended by the WHO. PVP-I was Table 3 Log 10reduction factor: the minimum measure microbicidal efcacy [EN 14885] German GuidelinesEU Standards (EN)EU Standards (EN)586 Infect Dis Ther (2019) 8:581-593also shown to be more virucidal against both enterovirus and coxsackievirus when comparedto other disinfectants. The need to develop potent antiviral for- mulations suitable for widespread use has beenbrought to prominence by the emergence of rapid viral outbreaks over the past decade, many of which have been coronaviruses. The MiddleEast Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS- CoV) is a single-stranded RNA virus rst iden- tied during an outbreak in 2012 that eventu-ally spread to 21 countries worldwide, triggering mass media coverage [ 24]. To date, the virus remains categorised as a high biosafety risk, with containment remaining the primary mea- sure to combat outbreaks, as no vaccines or specic antiviral treatments have yet beendeveloped. However, randomised controlled clinical trials have shown that PVP-I and alco- hol-based hand rubs are more effective thansoap-based hand washes for hand hygiene in the presence of such transmissible viruses [ 16]. In a study evaluating mouthwash, surgical scrubs, and skin cleanser formulations of PVP-Ifor antiviral activity against the MERS coron- avirus, it was shown that the viral titre could bereduced by a factor of C4 log 10, corresponding to a c.99.99% inactivation level [ 24]. This remarkable level of potency was achievedwithin 15 s of application of each PVP-I for- mulation, which included a 7.5% PVP-I surgical 1% PVP-I gargle/mouthwash and a cleanser formulation brand name Betadine (Mundipharma, Limburg, Germany). The ndings indicate that PVP-I- based hand hygiene products can be used to decontaminate virally-infected skin, while PVP-I mouthwash can reduce viral load in the oral cavity and the oropharynx, potentially aiding in the support of hygiene measures needed toreduce the severity of future MERS outbreaks. An earlier cooperative study presenting results in comparison with other antiseptics hasshown how PVP-I impacts the infectivity of some of the most signicant human pathogenic adeno-viruses have been decimated in test set-tings by a more than 3-log reduction within 60 sof exposure to PVP-I concentrations higher than0.5% [ 27]. Influenza virus was inactivated by a more than 5-log reduction following 15 s at the same dose levels, while HIV was reduced by a more than 4.5-log reduction after a 30-s expo-sure to doses higher than 0.05%. However, coxsackievirus and poliovirus type 1 were observed to be not as sensitive to PVP-I inacti-vation, with both viruses requiring doses higher than 0.125% for inactivation, as was the case for rhinovirus. The authors concluded that PVP-Ipreparations were effective against measles, mumps, herpes, HIV, ses, while rubella, polio-, adeno-, and rhino-viruses were only sensitive to higher doses. The fact that both virus types could be either sensi- tive or resistant regardless of whether they wereenveloped or non-enveloped suggests that mechanisms specic to certain viral types are likely to some extent to influence iodine sensi-tivity. Overall, the ndings are of particular relevance given that an overwhelming propor- tion of sore throat cases are thought to be ofviral origin, and there appears to remain an overprescribing of antibiotics in such cases. PVP-I FOR HOSPITAL INFECTION CONTROL Hospital settings are particularly challenging for antisepsis, as antibiotic-resistant strains are a constant threat. PVP-I is widely used in surgicalsettings to prevent infection by ensuring pre- operative decontamination. The aim of such decontamination is to reduce the risk of skinflora being introduced into sensitive areas once the skin barrier has been breached. Normal and innocuous bacterial flora that usually colonisehealthy skin can become harmful in such set- tings, particularly for immuno-compromised individuals. A PVP-I surgical scrub with a detergent and foam booster is recommended for the most effective preoperative sterilisation[11]. A comprehensive literature review by a joint committee consisting of representatives fromthe British Society of Antimicrobial Che- motherapy, the Hospital Infection Society, and the Infection Control Nurses AssociationInfect Dis Ther (2019) 8:581-593 587concluded that 7.5% povidone iodine 2% triclosan is helpful for the eradication and sup-pression of skin colonisation for short periods, particularly in preoperative settings [ 19]. The Working Party recommended in its ndings that patients bathe daily for 5 days with an appropriate antiseptic detergent. The skin should be moistened, and an antiseptic deter-gent should be applied thoroughly to all areas before rinsing in the bath or shower. The use of such antiseptics was also recommended for allother washing procedures and for bed bathing. Patients requiring endotracheal intubation are at a higher risk of microbial infection bybacterial strains including nosocomial pneu- monia. In a study of hospital patients under- going oral intubation, it was found that garglingwith 25 ml (2.5 mg/ml) of PVP-I for 1 min, twice, reduced the presence of bacteria in the trachea [ 28]. Prior to intubation, all 19 patients in the control group (5 of whom had MRSA) who gargled tap water were found to have bac- teria contaminating the tip of the tracheal tubeupon removal. However, in the group that gar- gled PVP-I, general bacteria and MRSA were eradicated from the pharynx prior to intuba-tion, as well as at the tip of the tracheal tube after removal. With proper use of PVP-I, surgical sites can be effectively decontaminated, and therisk of postoperative infection greatly reduced. Indeed, postoperative infection rates are lower when procedures include a sterilisation stepwith PVP-I [ 29]. Patients undergoing gastroin- testinal procedures are at a higher risk of post-operative wound infection due to the difculty in removing enteric bacteria present in the gut. However, PVP-I formulations have also beenshown to be effective in preventing complica- tions arising from infections in such settings [30], resulting in an average of ve fewer days spent in hospital recovery. Additionally, the use of a PVP-I mouthwash prior to dental extraction procedures has been shown to reduce gingivalbacteria, lowering the risk of bacteraemia [ 31]. Other sterilisation approaches can be con- sidered for use in combination with PVP-I.Microbial pathogens such as influenza and tuberculosis can spread by airborne pathways in hospital settings. Although UVC light is knownto inactivate such agents, even brief exposure tothis highly energetic light can damage humantissue. In an interesting recent study, research-ers used a UV-based sterilisation approach incorporating single-wavelength far-UVC light generated by ltered excilamps, which wasfound to kill pathogenic microorganisms [ 32]. Importantly, the wavelengths used cannotpenetrate human skin or eye tissue, and are notpowerful enough to cause biological damage to mammalian cells. Due to the considerably smaller scales at which microbial structuresexist, the 222-nm far-UVC light was highly effective in inactivating the H1N1 strain of influenza A virus. The viral particles were sus-pended in aerosolised droplets, simulating those generated by human coughing and breathing. In addition to its affordability as anantiseptic approach, one major advantage of UVC light is that it is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes. Like PVP-I, thisbroad spectrum of effect is particularly impor- tant considering the multidrug-resistant vari- ants of bacteria emerging in such settings. PVP-I FOR HYGIENIC INTERVENTIONS It has long been known that hand washing, when performed properly, can signicantlyreduce the carriage and spread of pathogens [33]. This has a direct effect on reducing patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial infections. Hand washing is an important and established procedure for infection control with clinically-validated efcacy and a core compo-nent of protocols aimed at reducing infectious outbreaks [ 11]. The skin can act as a reservoir for infectious agents, and the use of PVP-I for hand disinfection represents an alternative to alco- hol-based hand rubs, with medicated soaps containing PVP-I now readily available. Such PVP-I soaps have shown equivalent or superior efcacy to alcohol-based hand sanitisers whentested against norovirus, a common of gastroenteritis [ 20]. In contrast, chlorhexidine and triclosan-based hand washes, have been shown to be inferior against norovirus in prac- tical application tests. Hand washing with PVP- I-based formulations have shown similar588 Infect Dis Ther (2019) 8:581-593antimicrobial efcacy to an alcohol-based hand rub, with both being preferable to the use ofsoap and water alone [ 34]. In a direct comparison of the virucidal activity of various hand sanitisers, includingantimicrobial soaps and alcohol-based sanitis- ers, it was found in a modied ngerpad test that soap containing PVP-I was superior to theother soaps and sanitisers tested [ 35]. Three sanitisers were tested in the study, includingethanol, phosphoric acid, triclosan andchlorhexidine formulations. A modied test following the EN 1500 standard showed that the soap containing PVP-I was able to inactivatemurine norovirus by approximately 4 log 10 steps. More recent hand-hygiene simulationstudies have been described to test the com-parative efcacy of different agents for hand antisepsis. In one study, volunteers prewashed their hands before articially contaminatingthem with either Escherichia norovirus (virucidal) [ 36]. Antisepsis agents were then used in a ran-domised approach and the number of test organisms released from the ngertips was cal- culated in terms of mean log 10reduction factor as per EN1499 guidelines. The direct PVP-I 7.5% and 4% PVP-Iagainst murine norovirus, while both PVP-I and chlorhexidine were signicantly better than soft soap against E. coli . Such experimental models could be helpful in broader assessments of antisepsis agents. The Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) has published a series of guidelines for hand washing andhand antisepsis in healthcare settings to sup- plement those written by various other hygiene authorities, including the US Food and DrugAdministration. The guidelines recommend formulations containing 7.5% iodine for use as a surgical hand scrub. Lower concentrations(0.05%) have good antimicrobial activity due to the concentrations of free iodine increasing to some extent as the solution is diluted [ 37]. Thorough hand antisepsis, which can be achieved by hand washing or surgical scrubs with antimicrobial agents, is recommended insurgical settings before the performance ofinvasive procedures such as the placement ofintravascular catheters, or in any scenario whereit is deemed necessary to reduce numbers of resident skin flora and transient microorgan- isms on the skin. With recent hospital reports of vancomycin- resistant E. faecium emerging [ 1], as well as alcohol tolerance in some strains, it may beadvisable to take new considerations into account. In cases where infectious enterococci are identied (independent of vancomycinresistance), hand disinfection is almost cer- tainly recommendable (30 s). In cases where E. faecium has been conrmed, the extent to which hand disinfectants are used in the con-text of other available active substances should be considered. The disinfectants listed by theDisinfectants Commission of the Association for Applied Hygiene (VAH) also mentions products with various other active ingredientsincluding n-propanols, peroxides, and iodine products. derivatives, guanidine deriva-tives or iodine-cleaving compounds can also be considered. For surface disinfection, approaches that rely solely on alcohol disinfection shouldbe avoided and replaced with combination approaches with alcohol and other active sub- stances. For nal disinfection of patient roomswhere E. faecium may be present, per com- pound-based preparations can be used. PVP-I scrubs have better skin tolerance than soap formulations of chlorhexidine and qua- ternary ammonium compounds [ 38]. Although there is an urgent need for well-designed studiesdirectly comparing the clinical and economic proles of antiseptics in such settings, PVP-I canbe considered the antiseptic of choice for the management of supercial skin infections. Mouthwashes and gargles are commonly used in hospital settings to prevent respiratoryand endotracheal infections. In one hospital- based trial, adult subjects with chronic respira-tory diseases and repeat infections gargled a PVP-I formulation multiple times daily for extended durations up to 2 years [ 39]. Prior to the initiation of the study, 14 patients experi- enced a total of 67 episodes of infections (with a mean of 4.8 episodes). This was reduced to aremarkable mean number of 2.0 following PVP-IInfect Dis Ther (2019) 8:581-593 589gargling, representing a 58% reduction in the number of episodes. The most common causa-tive strains were identied as H. influenzae ,M. catarrhalis and pneumococci, with both of diluted to reflect real-life scenarios dilution; lent to a concentration of 0.23% PVP-I)according to EN13727 standards showed rapid antimicrobial effects after just 15 s of exposure [36]. Effective and clinically-meaningful bacte- ricidal activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae was observed under such conditions, as well as the inactivation ofcommon agents of serious respiratory tract infections including SARS-CoV, MERSCoV, influenza virus A (H1N1) and rotavirus. Seeking to investigate the efcacy of PVP-I gargle in settings, andcetylpiridium gargles was con- ducted, supported by a PVP-I study across eight middle schools in Japan [ 40]. PVP-I showed the highest bactericidal rate against all test strains observed within 30 s of exposure. Middle school students were trained and encouraged to use thegargles, with comparisons of absenteeism made between the schools that encouraged the prac- tice and those that did not. In the middleschool using the PVP-I gargle, absenteeism due to the common cold and influenza were signif- icantly lower compared to the schools using theother two agents. The authors concluded that the use of PVP-I gargle resulted in a decrease in absenteeism due to cold and influenza infections. EFFICACY OF PVP-I IN COMPARISON TO OTHER ANTISEPTIC AGENTS It has been more than 60 years since PVP-I was rst marketed as an antibiotic/antiseptic agent.Since its introduction, various other agents including triclosan and carbapenem have been introduced, although it has been 30 years sincea new class of antibiotic was last discovered. According to recent reviews, there have been no conrmed reports of resistance to PVP-I todate [ 41]. Numerous studies have shown that PVP-I has a broader antimicrobial spectrumthan other available antiseptics chlorhexidine, and Although alcohol-based antiseptics also have broad potency, unlike PVP-I formulations, they typically have no effect on fungal or bacterial spores. Inter-estingly, honey and maggots have been shown to have antibacterial properties when applied in therapeutic wound-treatment settings,although their potency in comparison to iodine against viruses and endospores remains to be determined [ 42]. SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY PVP-I is well tolerated by the majority of patients, particularly when applied to the skin [9]. In comparison to chlorhexidine, for exam- ple, PVP-I has rarely been associated with aller- gic contact dermatitis, while urticarial or anaphylactic reactions have been exceedinglyrare. The 2013 EU Safety Assessment Report Findings assessed human data involving 6.9 g of PVP-I applied to the hands and forearms for acontact time of less than 5 min and concluded that the proposed use of iodine in hand disin- fection products is suitable for human health.Although PVP-I is generally seen as very safe, with long-term use, cases of thyroid dysfunc- tion induced by PVP-I have been reported. Forthis reason, patients receiving PVP-I treatment for extended periods of time should be carefully monitored [ 43]. CONCLUSIONS With recent reports of emerging resistance to antibiotics, including ampicillin and van- comycin, attention has turned to the use ofbroad-spectrum antiseptics in limiting hospital- based infectious outbreaks. Despite its long history of efcacious use, no signicant cases ofresistance to iodine have emerged. This is thought to be due to its broad antimicrobial activity, which has been conrmed by globalhealth authorities including the World Health590 Infect Dis Ther (2019) 8:581-593Organization and the European Wound Man- agement Association. European guidelines for testing PVP-I for- mulations during hand washing and topicalapplications recommend a stepwise approach,combined with standardised tests using vali- dated test Betadine /C210 antiseptic solution have demon- strated and includingEbola, MERS, SARS potency and accessibility of PVP-I therefore likely to be ofcontinuing and signicant benet for human health on a global scale, particularly in the developing world where ensuring affordableaccess to reliable antiseptic agents can be challenging. Furthermore, in comparison to most antibi- otics, the use of broad-spectrum antisepticsreduces the likelihood of resistance emerging due to multiple mechanisms of action targetingdiverse aspects of cell biology and replication machinery. In contrast to PVP-I, bacterial resis- tance to chlorhexidine, quaternary ammoniumsalts, silver and triclosan has been documented. The long track record of efcacious use of PVP-I in clinical settings is also an advantage forfurther clinical investigation. The WHO rec- ommends decision-makers be guided by all available scientic evidence regarding theexpected benets and risks of any therapeutic application. For this reason, the considerable unmet medical needs that still remain for infectious diseases in home and healthcare environments call for the further investigationof PVP-I formulations in such settings.
