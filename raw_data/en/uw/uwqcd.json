Please book with her directly by calling (703) 667-0465, or email ileana@belovedyoga.com Click below to download this FREE resource, a PDF guide on the science and practice of Ayurveda. - Marma Therapy: Energy Healing for Mind & Body \"Marma\" points, considered \"doorways\" or \"entry points\" into our body's inner pathways - energy channels that allow Prana to flow through the spine, thereby nourishing the body and mind. When activated through gentle touch, the flow of Prana that travels from these points through the body, can have a profound healing effect. Marma therapy can offer an intuitive layer to spiritual practice, allowing the practitioner to connect on a deeper level through gentle, light self-touch. Touching a marma point changes the body's biochemistry and has the potential to unfold healing on the subtlest levels of the body and mind. Marma can actually alter consciousness, and change one's awareness. From that place a person can move forward with self care, creativity, and renewed energy. This therapy is unique to Ayurveda, and can grant you a deeper connection with your whole self (body, mind, spirit). It also offers you an opportunity to release excess energy in your body. Please note, this is NOT an oil massage, but each session does include hand, feet, and face massage using a specially blended oil. 45 minute Marma session, $108 - Ayurveda & Yoga Lifestyle Mentoring Take a deep dive into the Yogi lifestyle using the comprehensive, holistic approach of Ayurveda and Yoga.

Everything you do on the mat affects how your body and mind respond off the mat, and so our practices should help cultivate sattva so that we can remain resilient in the face of challenges.
