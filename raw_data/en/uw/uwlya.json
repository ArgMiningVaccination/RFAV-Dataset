How Do Therapeutic injection near Fort Lauderdale Work? In most cases when the acupuncture physician chooses to use injection therapy, it is done so on an acupuncture point that will help the ailment you're suffering from. If not an acupoint, then an \"ashi\" point, which is a point of tenderness along the body or channel. Injecting the solution into an ashi point along a muscle can help reduce pain and inflammation. When injected the goal is to provide nutrients as well as hydration to the muscles to help soothe and heal during the recovery process. Ashi points are usually chosen in cases of lower back pain, neck pain, and myofascial pain. The benefits include and are not limited to stronger stimulation to the point chosen for injection, and results that last longer. In most cases, it takes the solution 48 hours to fully get absorbed into the body. What Are Some Things Homeopathic Injections Include?
