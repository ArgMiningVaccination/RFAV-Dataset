Have you ever used healing crystals before? Maybe you would like to try using crystals but don't know much about them? Well, you're at the right place as I'm here to tell you a bit more about it... Since the earliest times, crystals have been used to heal and restore balance. They help in releasing and clearing negative energy, thereby assisting in energy healing. In fact, the earliest records of Crystal Healing have been traced in Ancient Egypt. India's Ayurvedic records and traditional Chinese medicine also claim to heal with the use of crystals, dating back to 5000 years ago! In a nutshell, Crystal Healing is used to treat people and their energy systems. By placing the crystals on and around the body, the crystals can act as a channel for healing which can help positive and healing energy flow into the body, causing negative energy to be drawn out. What are Crystals? Crystals are nature's gift to man and are found in all shapes, sizes, colours, and composition. Each crystal has a unique vibrational resonance. They owe their unique qualities to their mineral content, their inherent geometry, and the colour frequency they emit. There are a lot of different types of crystals that are used for different reasons. We are going to focus on specific crystals according to the doshas (if you don't know about your doshas, please fill out the dosha quiz here). If you have a predominant Vata (cold) constitution the best stones/crystal for you are jasper, smoky quartz, obsidian, or black tourmaline. These gemstones carry earth balancing qualities to bring a sense of grounding, connection and calming of the mind. If you are more on the Pitta (hot) side then pearl, moonstone, amethyst, emerald, clear quartz, citrine, aquamarine, and blue sapphire are your best bet to bring a lightness of being and clearing of the mind and body! As for the Kapha (earthy) constitutions the most potent crystals would be ruby, garnet, carnelian, yellow sapphire, or cat's eye to gain more vitality (sun energy), inner strength, and energy to get things done! In addition to using specific crystals for our doshas, all of us can always benefit from the potent and popular stones like : Amethyst, which is believed to relieve stress and awaken spiritual awareness and Clear quartz can be used to clear the mind and counteract negative energy blockages. Rose quartz which is believes to enhance feelings of love and compassion towards ourselves and others. Opal believed to encourage both freedom and independence. Opal enhances cosmic consciousness and induces psychic and mystical visions. It stimulates originality and creativity. Helps to release anger and claim self-worth, aiding in accessing and expressing one's true self. There you have it, Crystal Healing 101 ;)Hopefully, my love of gemstones will prompt you to try them for yourself and witness their powerful beauty and potency!
