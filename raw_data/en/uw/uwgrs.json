Approximately 30 species of Jyotishmati are found throughout the world from which 7 species are found in India and 25 species are available in China. Jyotishmati is a scrambling shrub or climber, traditionally known as Malkangani and used as Medhya Rasayana (intellect-promoting drug). As per Ayurvedic classical texts, Jyotismati is pungent and bitter, laxative reduces Kapha and Vata, and is very much heat generating, emetic, penetrating, and appetizer. It enhances the functioning of the mind and recollection capacity. It is used in various disorders Jyotismati contains active principles like Valeranone, a sesquiterpenoid is major and others included spiro-jatamol, patchouli alcohol, nor-seychelanone, alpha and beta patchoulene, Jatmaushic terpenic coumarins like oroselol, j and lignans like Jyotishmati : , Stem of Jyotishmati is having white shining dots (lenticels), it improves intellect and has hot potency. Synonyms of Jyotishmati - According to morphology - Jyotishmati is a climber. - : | Root of Jyotishmati resembles the legs of a pigeon. - : | Stem bark has shining white dots over its surface. - | Jyotishmati has yellow-colored flowers. - | Fruits are small in size. - | Fruits of Jyotishmati are resembling the eggs of a crow. - According to properties and action - : | The oil prepared from Jyotishmati will be yellow. - | Jyotishmati improves intellect. - | Jyotishmati alleviates many diseases. - : | Jyotishmati postpones senility as it is a Rasayana. - | Seeds and oil of Jyotishmati are solid in the market. Regional names of Jyotishmati - Staff tree (English) - Malkangani panicle inflorescence. Dalhana has called it Kakamardanika which he has described as having round and red seeds with yellow which refers to Malakanguna. He has, on the other hand, been given the same name as Tejovati which is different. The Kavirajas of Bengal believe Cardiospermum halicacabum Linn. to be Jyotismati which, in our opinion, is Kakadni. In the Adhobhagahara group of drugs, Kshira or latex of Jyotismati as a purgative drug has been mentioned. It might be noted that some plants of Celastraceae do contain latex but not the one referred to above. Charaka Samhita: C. S. Su. 1/ 77, 78, C. S. Su. 2/ 4, C. S. Su. 4/ 27, C. S. Su. 5/ 23, C. S.

U. 28/ 34 Jyotishmati's description in Brihtrayi as Paravat Padi This is considered to be a synonym of Kakajangha and Jyotishmati. Dalhana describes it as a variety of Hainsapadi with a reddish tinge. The name is a term indicative of the leaf morphology and may imply a close resemblance between the shape of the leaves and the legs or feet of a pigeon or a water bird in general. The winged leaves of Vitex, Leea, or Xanthoxylum species might have been the basis for naming one of them Paravatapadi. Charaka Samhita: C. S. Ka. 1/ 26 Sushruta 9/ 32 in Brihtrayi as Tejovati Dalhana has described Tejavati as if it is a synonym of Jyotishmati. The common popular name Kakamardanika has been given by him for both of them while others have supposed it to be Tumburu. In C. S. Vi. 8. 158, Jyotismati root and Tejovati bark have been included in the errhine group of drugs and so both must be considered as belonging to different sources. The similarity in the names and their uses appear to have led to this confusion. Charaka Samhita: C. S. Vi. 8/ 149, 158, C. S. Chi. 8/ 136, C. S. Chi. 17/ 140, C. S. Chi. 26/ 188, 215, C. S.

H. description as Alavana Sushruta Samhita: S. S. Su. 38/ 15, S. S. Chi. 17/ 34 Jyotishmati's description in Brihtrayi as Katabhi (Controversy) This is a highly controversial drug. It has been used mostly as an Alexipharmic and included in preparations useful for Epilepsy (Apasmara) and Mania (Unmaad). Its bark has often been recommended for use. Katabhi and Kinihi are usually considered synonyms (compare C. S. Ci. 10. 31 and S. S. U. 61. 23) and were variously interpreted to be Aprajita, Apamarg, Jyotishmati or Sirisa varieties. Now, Kinihi has been identified with white Shirisha. It is, therefore, safe to accept only Shweta Shrisha for both Katabhi and Kinhi Charaka Samhita: C. S. Chi. 9/ 75, C. S. Chi. 10/ 31, C. S. Chi. 15/ 188, C. S. Chi. 23/ 65, 78, 186, 203, 213, 243 Sushruta Samhita: S. S. Chi. 31/ 5, S. S. Ka. 3/ 12, S. S. Ka. 5/ 18 Vagbhata: A. H. Su. 7/ 24, A. H. U. 22/ 57, A. H. U. 37/ 36, A. H. U. 38/ 26 Jyotishmati's description in Brihtrayi as Kakadni This drug name does not occur in Charaka. If the version of Sthulakakadani is correct, two kinds of Kakadani were recognized by Vagbhata. Dalhana has identified it with Himsra, Vayasatinduka, Krana Sriphalika etc. and others Ayurvedists of Bengal ) also has a chance to be considered as Kakadani. It might be noted that roots have often been recommended for use and not fruits and there is also a possibility that the roots are poisonous in effect. According to Susruta, Avagutha, and Veganama are synonyms of Kakadani. Sushruta S. Su. 39/ 9, S. S. Chi. 14/ 8, S. S. Chi. 18/ 13, 36, S. S. Chi. 19/ 63, S. S. Ka. 7/ 31, S. S. U. 28/ 6, S. S.

Chi. 9/ S. 14/ 10 Jyotishmati's description in Brihtrayi as Sthula Kakadni The meaning of Sthula Kakadni is not clear. It may indicate Jyotishmati. Vagbhata: A. H. Chi. 17/ 27 Historical background of Jyotishmati Katabha stems are mentioned among the ritual items in the Vedic literature (A. Pa. 26/ 5/ 1- 5). But its identity with Jyotismati is doubtful. Charaka quoted it among Sirovirecana Dravyas. is used as a purgative agent. Vagbhata emphasized the utility of Jyotismati in the management of Sidhma Kushta and Bhagandara. Dalhana considered it as Kakamardanika which possesses round and red seeds yielding yellow oil. Controversial Studies regarding Jyotishmati Sushruta used the term 'Alavana' twice in his work (S. S. Su.38/ 14 & Ci. 17/ 34). Both Dhanvantari and Raja Nighantu have given it as the synonym for Jyotismati while Kaiyadeva mentioned it as Salavana. Bapalaji did not accept the concept and equated 'Alavana' to Haritaki. Kaviraj Vinodalal Sen has Phana/ Raktaphala\". helicacabum Linn. Online - Dr. Sahil Gupta (B.A.M.S., M.H.A.)

The useful part of Jyotishmati Seeds, Fruits. Seeds and fruits of Celastrus paniculatus contain 3 to 6 seeds enclosed in a complete arillus of deep orange. Seeds are triquetrous, reddish brown, and slightly arched with acute ends. The testa is hard, enclosing a white kernel that releases oil when putting some pressure. Has an aromatic odor. Important phytoconstituent of Jyotishmati The oil contains coloring matter; the fat contains formic, acetic, and benzoic acid. Fleshy aril yields fat. Alkaloid clastrine, panicalatine. The stimulant action of celastrine is especially manifested in the brain and is not followed by secondary depression. Seeds yield brownish oil (52.2%) with an unpleasant taste. Oil is extracted from seeds by two methods which yield black oil-oleum nigrum and oil Recent research on Celastrus paniculatus - The objective of the present study was to evaluate the hypolipidemic effect of the methanolic extract of Celastrus paniculatus in experimentally induced hypercholesterolemic rats. Histological studies showed fewer cholesterol deposits in the aorta of animals fed with seed extract of C. paniculatus, compared to the induced hypercholesterolemic animals not given supplement. of Celastrus paniculatus Will. (Celastraceae) seed aqueous extract on learning and memory was studied using elevated plus maze and passive avoidance test (sodium nitrite induced amnesia rodent model). The study reveals that the aqueous extract of Celastrus paniculatus seed has dose-dependent cholinergic activity, M, & JOY, KRUPAMOL & R, BADMANABAN & R, ALEESHA. (2020). TOXICITY PROFILE OF CELASTRUS PANICULATUS SEEDS: A PRECLINICAL STUDY. Asian Journal of Pharmaceutical and Clinical Research. 115- 118. 10. 22159/ ajpcr. 2020. v13i7. 37803. Objective: The objective of the study was to evaluate the toxicity profile of Celastrus paniculatus (CP) by performing a preclinical study on Swiss albino mice and demonstrate a safety description through monitoring their autonomic, neurological, behavioral, physical, and biochemistry profiles. Methods: The toxicity profiles (acute and subacute) of CP were evaluated using Swiss albino mice which were divided into four groups: Group I received 1% Tween 20 and dimethyl sulfoxide. Group II, III, and IV received CP seed oil orally, at doses of 300, 2000, and 5000 mg/kg body weight for both acute and subacute toxicity studies under Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development guidelines No. 423. Special attention was given during the first 4 h and daily thereafter for a total of 14 days. Behavioral profile, physical state changes, and other parameters such as tremors, convulsion, and lethargy were noted. Clinical signs were observed daily during the 28 days of the treatment period. Body weights were measured once a week. On the 29th day, the animals were kept overnight and blood samples were collected through retro-orbital puncture for biochemical analysis. Results: In both acute and subacute toxicity studies, the treatment with CP did not affect the normal health status of animals. It is suggestive that CP is considered practically non-toxic. Conclusion: The toxicity profile of CP seed oil was evaluated and found to be safe until the 2000 mg/kg dose. - To investigate the mode of the relaxing action of a methanolic extract prepared from the seeds of Celastrus paniculatus (CPE, 0.001-10 microg/mL) in the rat ileum and to try to confirm human tissue's intestinal pharmacological activity of the extract. It is concluded that (i) CPE exerted a powerful myogenic and L-type Ca (2+)- dependent relaxing effect in the isolated rat ileum and that (ii) the human ileum is sensitive to the inhibitory effect of CPE. If confirmed in vivo, our data could explain the traditional use of this herb in the treatment of intestinal spasms. Borrelli, F, Borbone N.

J Ethnopharmacology. 1990 Mar; 28 paniculatus seeds against common neurological ailments: a narrative review. Journal of Complementary and Integrative Medicine. 10.1515/jcim-2021-0448. The most common human neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), etc. have been recognized to result from a complex interplay between genetic predisposition and defective cellular dynamics such as inappropriate accumulation of unfolded proteins, oxygen free radicals and mitochondrial dysfunction. The treatment strategies available today for these neurodegenerative ailments are only palliative and are incapable of restraining the progression of the disease. Hence, there is an immense requirement for the identification of drug candidates with the ability to alleviate neuronal damage along with controlling the progression of the disease. From time immemorial mankind has been relying on plants for treating varied types of dreadful diseases. Among the various medicinal plants used for treating various neurological ailments, Celastrus paniculatus (CP) popularly known as Jyotishmati or Malkangni is well known in the Ayurveda system of Indian Traditional Medicine whose seeds and seed oil have been used for centuries in treating epilepsy, dementia, facial paralysis, amnesia, anxiety, sciatica, cognitive dysfunctions, etc. This review apart from specifying the phytochemical characteristics and traditional uses of C. paniculatus seeds and seed oil also exemplify the comprehensive data derived from various research reports on their therapeutic potential against some common neurological disorders. The oil obtained from the seeds of the plant produced sedation in rats at a dose of 1g/kg i.m. On i.p. administration, the same dose of oil produced sedation but the effect was not so marked. The oil showed anticonvulsant activity in rats. 50-100 mg/kg of oil (as an emulsion) produced a gradual fall in B.P. of cats. 20 mg/kg of the oil produced fall in cardiac output, bradycardia, and a marked increase in pulse pressure on isolated heart-lung preparation (Gaitonde et al., 1957). - An active fraction (Mal IIIA) had a tranquilizing effect in rats, mice, monkeys, and cats at a dose of 200 mg/kg. It potentiated the effect of hexobarbitone and produced hypothermia in mice. Diminution of carotid occlusion reflex and hypotension was observed in anesthetized cats. Fraction Mal III and Mal IM/B produced salivation, vomiting, defecation, and tremors in cats and dogs (Sheth et al., 1963). - A polyester prepared from the oil also decreased amphetamine-induced hyperactivity and group toxicity in albino rats (Joglekar & Belwani, 1967). - Aerial parts of the plant were found to possess antiviral activity against the Ranikhet disease virus (Bhakuni et al; 1969). - Root bark chloroform extract showed significant antimalarial activity against Plasmodium falciparum in vitro (phytotherapy Res., 1989). - Methanolic extract of C. paniculatus slowed analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities (Ahmed et al; 1994). - Its antispermatogenic effect is also reported (Wangoo 1988 & (GIT disorder mainly ascites): Oil of Jyotismati fruits mixed with Svarjika and Hingu should be taken wound- cleansing group. processed with water Sena flowers with gruel and fried jyotishmati leaves, by intake, induce menstruation.
