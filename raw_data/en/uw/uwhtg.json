{"title": "ORGANIZED SESSION: The Full Societal Benefits of Vaccination", "author": "Daniel Cadarette; Saad Omer; Hannes Schwandt", "url": "https://healtheconomics.confex.com/healtheconomics/2021/meetingapp.cgi/Session/2052", "hostname": "confex.com", "description": "Economic evaluations of vaccines and immunization programs have traditionally focused on a relatively narrow set of vaccination benefits from a health-centric perspective. These \"narrow benefits\" of vaccination include reduced morbidity, mortality, and health care costs resulting from direct prevention of infection by the vaccine-targeted pathogen. Recently, however, researchers and policymakers have started to recognize that vaccination confers a range of additional health, economic, and social benefits beyond those normally assessed. Additional health benefits include herd protection, prevention of nosocomial infections in hospitalized patients, and reduced antimicrobial consumption and, plausibly, resistance. Examples of economic benefits include improvements in cognition and educational outcomes among children, as well as increased labor force participation, productivity, and income among adults. Examples of social benefits include improved social equity and prevention of negative intergenerational effects from premature mortality of a parent or grandparent. These \"broader benefits\" may accrue to vaccinated individuals, their families and households, or their communities. Over the past several years, some national and international policymakers have begun moving towards including broader benefits in their health technology assessments of vaccinations. Consideration of such benefits could have a meaningful impact on decisions regarding investments in vaccination programs and, ultimately, in vaccination research and development. To the extent that this results in a more-rational allocation of society's resources, social welfare stands to improve as a result. Generation of new evidence on the full societal benefits of vaccination is an essential element of this process. The research presented in this session focuses on this type of evidence generation. The included studies cover a wide range of vaccination's full benefits, including reduced morbidity and mortality, reduced health care costs, reduced antimicrobial consumption, improved cognitive development and early educational attainment, and increased or improved income, consumption, and health status throughout the lifecycle. They also cover a range of vaccines (including pneumococcal vaccine, rotavirus vaccine, Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, and a prospective group A Streptococcus vaccine), geographies, and country income levels, from lower-middle income to high income. Finally, they cover a range of methods, including systematic literature review and meta-analysis, primary data collection, leveraging of natural experiments, agent-based microsimulation modeling, social welfare analysis, and use of a lifecycle model to estimate the full value of vaccination over an individual's lifespan. Taken together, the presented research will offer a compelling picture of the nature of vaccination's hypothesized broader benefits, the strength of evidence in support of their consideration, and the methods available for their measurement. After the four presentations included in the session, we plan to leave time for a moderated discussion. The session chair, who has extensive experience researching the full societal impacts of vaccination and other health interventions, will act as moderator. We will also have two discussants, both of whom are actively pursuing their own research in this field. Within the limits of time and technology, we will also open the discussion to include members of the audience.", "sitename": "IHEA - 2021 World Congress on Health Economics", "date": "2021-07-12", "cleaned_text": "Welcome to the 2021 World Congress on Health Economics... please wait while the program loads.
