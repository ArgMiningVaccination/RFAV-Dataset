COVID-19 treatments do not replace vaccinations. Vaccines are given to help your immune system fight a future COVID-19 infection. The COVID-19 vaccine is not recommended within 4 weeks of having COVID-19. Mixing Paxlovid with herbal remedies and supplements Do not take St John's wort, the herbal remedy for depression, while you are being treated with Paxlovid. This is because it may make your course of treatment less effective. There is not enough information to say that other [herbal remedies](/conditions/herbal-medicines/) or supplements are safe to take with Paxlovid. They are not tested in the same way as pharmacy and prescription medicines. They're generally not tested for the effect they have on other medicines. Important: Medicine safety Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal remedies, vitamins or supplements. "}
