The extension requires that all guests and crew must show proof of vaccination at check-in prior to boarding. The Crystal Clean+ protocols also include COVID-19 testing at embarkation, routine temperature checks, mask-wearing when in crowded spaces, physical distancing and more. Each Crystal River Cruises ship is designed with space in mind, and with only 106-120 guests aboard, the all-balcony ships offer a great option for luxury, small-ship river cruising without having to worry about crowded spaces where physical distancing is not possible. \"The health and safety of our guests and crew is paramount to everything we do at Crystal River Cruises, and as such, we will require full vaccination through 2022 so that our guests can continue to explore the world in great comfort and safety,\" said Walter Littlejohn, Crystal River Cruises' senior vice president and managing director. \"After months of planning and preparation we welcomed guests back on board in late August and the feedback has been wonderful. Extending the vaccination requirement provides our guests with the health and safety information and assurances they need to plan future travels.\" Lacey Pfalz is a freelance Associate Writer for TravelPulse.
