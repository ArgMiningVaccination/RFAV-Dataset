He said he would often see events before they happened. \"I would have dreams and visions that reveal deeper secrets, which cost me some friendships,\" he said. He said his spiritual connection became stronger when he was about 30, where ancestors visited him as a butterfly. \"It was my great-great grandmother who told me to accept my calling, give guidance and heal people who are sick.\" Then he went to Lesotho to trace the gogo, who was also a traditional healer, and his journey began. Today, Ben is a respected healer in Botshabelo, Free State, who does not use ditaola (bones) to consult. Instead, he uses the client's clan names. \"I blend into their clan names as I will be spiritually connected to their forefathers. They can even work as praises,\" said Ben, whose known as Mohlakwa wa Pholo ya seema. Ben is the deputy chairman of the National Unitary Professional Association for Traditional Health Practitioners of South Africa, where he ensures traditional healers' voices are heard and recognised. He said the organisation was launching a Covid-19 vaccination programme this weekend in Kroonstad to encourage people to take their jabs. He was also one of the panellists during the official launch of the Vaccination 4 Men campaign in Rosebank, Joburg. \"I appeal to all leaders to become vaccinated,\" he said. "}
