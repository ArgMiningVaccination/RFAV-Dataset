A designation of a foreign state (or part of such foreign state) under this paragraph shall not become effective unless notice of the designation (including a stat ement of the findings under this paragraph and the effective date of the designation) is published in the Federal Register . In such notice, the [Secretary] shall also state an estimate of the number of nationals of the foreign state designated who are (or within the effective period of the designation are likely to become) eligible for temporary protected status under this section and their immigration status in the United States. 2 See 86 FR 1 3574 (March 9, 202 1) (18 -month designation of Venezuela for TP S through September 9, 2022 ). iii On March 19, 202 1, Secretary Mayorkas announced via FRN the extension of the TPS designation for Syria and the redesignation of Syria for 18 months, effective March 31 , 2021, through September 3 0, 202 2.3 On M ay 25, 202 1, Secretary Mayorkas announced via FRN the TPS designation for Burma (Myanmar) for 18 months, effective May 25, 2021, through November 25 , 202 2.4 On July 9, 202 1, Secretary Mayorkas announced via FRN the extension of the TPS designation for Yemen and the redesignation of Yemen for 18 months, effective September 4 , 2021, through March 3, 202 3.5 On July 22, 202 1, Secretary Mayorkas announced via FRN the extension of the TPS designation for Somalia and the redesignation of Somalia for 18 months, effective September 18, 2021, through March 17, 202 3.6 On August 3 , 202 1, Secretary Mayorkas announced via FRN the extension of the registration periods from 180 days to 18 months for initial applicants under the TPS designations for Venezuela, Syria, and Burma .7 On August 3 , 202 1, Secretary Mayorkas announced via FRN the TPS designation for Haiti for 18 months, effective August 3 , 2021, through February 3 , 202 3.8 The Secretary did not announce any TPS actions regarding South Sudan, although the existing 18-month designation continued during CY 2021. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS ) continued to process applications related to the TPS program for this country. During CY 202 1, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) also announced9 actions to ensure its continued compliance with the preliminary injunction orders of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in Ramos, et al. v. Nielsen, et al., No. 18 -cv-01554 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 3, 2018) (\" Ramos\" ) and the U.S. Distri ct Court for the Eastern District of New York in Saget, et al., v. Trump, et al., No. 18 -cv-1599 (E.D.N.Y. Apr il 11, 2019) (\" Saget\" ), and with the order of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California to stay proceedings in Bhattarai v. Nielsen, No. 19 -cv-00731 (N.D. Cal. Mar ch 12, 2019) (\" Bhattarai\" ).10 3 See 86 FR 1 4946 (March 19, 202 1) (18 -month extension of Syria 's TPS designation through September 3 0, 202 2, and redesignation of Syria for TPS through September 30, 2022 ). 4 See 86 FR 28132 (May 25, 202 1) (18 -month designati on of Burma for TPS through November 25, 2022 ). 5 See 86 FR 36295 (July 9 , 202 1) (18 -month extension of Yemen 's TPS designation through March 3, 202 3, and redesignation of Yemen for TPS through March 3, 2023 ). 6 See 86 FR 38744 (July 22 , 202 1) (18 -month extension of Somalia 's TPS designation through March 17, 202 3, and redesignation of Somalia for TPS through March 17, 2023 ). 7 See 86 FR 41986 (August 4 , 202 1) (The 18 -month registration period to apply for TPS under the designation of TPS for Venezuela ran from March 9, 2021, through September 9, 2022; The 18 -month registration period to apply for TPS under the redesignation of TPS for Syria ran from March 19, 2021, through September 30, 2022; The 18- month registration period to apply for TPS u nder the designation of TPS for Burma ran from May 25, 2021, through November 25, 2022 ). 8 See 86 FR 41863 (August 3 , 202 1) (18 -month designation of Haiti for TPS through February 3, 2023 ). 9 See 86 FR 50725 (September 10, 202 1) (continued compliance with the preliminary injunction order in Ramos , as well as orders in Bhattarai and Saget ). 10 Although a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated the Ramos preliminary injunction on September 14, 2020, the pla intiffs have requested en banc review of the panel's decision, and litigation is continuing. See Ramos, et al., v. Wolf, et al. , No. 18 -16981(9th Cir., Sept. 14, 2020). The district court's preliminary injunction remained in effect throughout CY 2020, as did the Bhattarai and Saget court orders. iv Most recently , on September 10 , 2021, DHS published another Federal Register notice announc ing the continuation of TPS and TPS -related documentation through December 31 , 2022, for eligible , affected TPS beneficiaries from the six countries whose TPS designations are the subject of one or more of the three lawsuits noted above : El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras , Nepal , Nicaragua, and Sudan .11 DHS will continue to ensure its compliance w ith all relevant court orders if it remains necessary after that date. 11 See 86 FR 50725 (September 10, 202 1) (continued compliance with the preliminary injunction order in Ramos , as well as orders in Bhattarai and Saget ). v Temporary Prote cted Status: Calendar Year 20 21 Annual Report Table of Contents I.

Legislative Requirement Section 244( i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254 a(i)) provides : (i) Annual Report and Review. - (1) Annual report .- Not later than March 1 of each year (beginning with 1992), the [Secretary of Homeland Security] , after consultation with the appropr iate agencies of the Government, shall submit a report to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the Senate on the operation of this section during the previous year. Each report shall include \u2014 (A) a listing of the foreign states or parts thereof designated under this section , (B) the number of nationals of each such state who have been granted temporary protected status under this section and their immigration status before being granted such status , and (C) an explanation of the reasons why foreign states or parts thereof were designated under subsection (b)(1) and, with respect to foreign states or parts thereof previously designated, why the designation was terminated or extended under subsection (b)(3). (2) Committee report .- No later than 180 days after the date of receipt of such a report, the Committee on the Judiciary of each House of Congress shall report to its respective House such oversight findings and legislation as it deems appropriate. 2 II. Background Section 244(b)(1) of the INA provides the Secretary with the authority to designate a foreign state , or any part of such state , for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) upon finding , among other things, that such state is experiencing ongoing armed conflict, an environmental disaster, or other extraordinary and temporary conditions . (See Executive Summary, fn. 1, for specific statutory requirements for each type of designation .) The Secretary may grant TPS to an eligible national of the designated foreign state (or to an eligible noncitizen having no nationality who last habitu ally resided in such state) who, as described in section 244(c)(1) (A) of the INA and implementing regulations in 8 C .F.R. \u00a7 244.2: Has been continu ously physical ly presen t in the United States since the effective date of the most recent designation of the state as published in the Federal Register notice for the country designation ; Has continuously resided in the United States since a date determine d by the Secretary and published in the Federal Register notice ; Is admissible as an immigrant except as otherwise provided under section 244(c)(2)(A) of the INA; Is not ineligible for TPS under section 244(c)(2)(B) of the INA; and Registers during an initial registration period of not less than 180 days, as announced by public notice in the Federal Register , or the applicant meets late initial registration criteria during any subsequent extension of TPS designation pursuant to 8 C .F.R. \u00a7 244.2(f)(2). During the period for which the Secretary has designated a foreign state for TPS, registered TPS beneficiaries are eligible to remain in the United States , cannot be removed, and are authorized to work , so long as the ir TPS has not been withd rawn for individual ineligibility. They may also be granted authorization to travel abroad temporarily with the prior consent of the Secretary . See INA \u00a7\u00a7 244(a)(1) , 244(a)(2) , and 244(f)(3). The granting of TPS itself does not lead to lawful permanent resident status. When the Secretary terminates a foreign state's TPS designation, beneficiaries return to the same immigration status they possessed prior to gaining TPS (unless that status has since expired or been terminated) or to any other status they may have obtained while registered for TPS. Beneficiaries who had no lawful status before obtaining TPS and who have not obtained any other lawful status after TPS retu rn to unlawful status when the TPS designation ends. 3 III.

Any such TPS actions will be noted on the TPS Calendar Year 202 2 report and can also be found on USCIS' website at: h ttps://www.usci s.gov/humanitarian/temporary -protected -status . 13 See, e.g., Ramos, et al. v.

Appendix A provides the description of each of the status abbreviations in the first column of the table . Under INA \u00a7 244(a)(5), a noncitizen may continue to maintain his or her prior immigration status while holding TPS, provided he or she maintains eligibility for the prior immigration status . 14 Data may differ from prior reports due to annual fluctuations in the number of beneficiaries and to steps taken t o improve data accuracy. 15 Data Source: Computer Linked Application Information Management System (CLAIMS), USCIS Electronic Immigration System (USCIS ELIS), and USCIS Service Center Operations Directorate, as adjusted. Prior immigration status is self-reported by TPS beneficiaries on Form I -821, Application for Temporary Protected Status. 16 This is based upon self -reported information, which i s not always accurate.

Analysis/Discussion Section 4.1 Legal Authority for the Secretary to Designate a Foreign State for TPS Under INA \u00a7 244(b)(1) Under INA \u00a7 244(b)(1), the Secretary, after consultation with appropriate agencies of the U.S. Government, may designate a foreign state (or any part of such foreign state) if the conditions in the foreign state fall into one or more of three statutory categories, generally described as ongoing armed conflict, environmental disasters, or extraordinary and temporary conditions.17 An initial TPS designation is purely discretionary , and the Secretary can decline to make a designation even if he or she determines that eligible conditions exist in a foreign state. The Secretary may designat e the foreign state for a period of six, 12, or 18 months.18 When the Secretary designates a foreign state for TPS , he or she establishes the dates from which a TPS applicant must have continuously resided in and been continuously physically present in the United States in order to be eligible for TPS under the particular design ation.19 By establishing these \"continuous residence\" and \"continuous physical presence\" dates in accordance with the TPS statute, the Secretary is able to afford temporary protection to the most appropriate group of noncitizen s from the designated country. Section 4.2 Legal Authority for the Secretary to Extend or Terminate TPS Designations of Foreign States Under INA \u00a7 244(b)(3) As required by the INA, t he Secretary conducts a periodic review of country conditions affecting each TPS -designated foreign state in consultation with appropriate agencies of the U.S. Government, to determine whether the conditions support extension or termination of the TPS designation, and whether a new designation may be warranted .20 In making this determination, the Secretary typically reviews country conditions info rmation provided by the Department of State ( DOS ) and USCIS 's Refugee, Asylum, and International Operations Directorate. At least 60 days prior to the current expiration of a country's TPS designation, the Secretary must review the conditions in the designated foreign state and determine whether the conditions for such designation continue to be met. If the Secretary determines that the statutory conditions for designation no longer continue to be met, the TPS statute requires that he or she terminate the designation. If the Secretary finds, however, that the cond itions for designation continue to be met (or makes no determination at all), the statute requires that the TPS designation be extended for a minimum of six months, or, in the Secretary's discretion, for 12 or 18 months. USCIS publishes a notice in the Federal Register that announces t he Secretary's determination of whether to extend , extend and make a new designation , or terminate a country's TPS designation . 17 See supra note 1 (providing text of INA \u00a7 244(b)(1)). 18 See INA \u00a7 244(b)(2)(B). 19 See INA \u00a7 244(c)(1)(A). The continuous residence date is such date as the Secretary may establish. Id. at \u00a7(244(c)(1)(A)(i). However, the continuous physical presence date is the effective date of the most recent designation, which itself is the Federal Regi ster notice publication date of the designation or such later date as the Secretary may specify in the notice. See Id. at \u00a7244(b)(2)(A); \u00a7244(c)(1)(A)(ii) . 20 See INA \u00a7 244(b)(3)(A -C). 11 That notice includes an explanation of the reasons for the determination . Section 4. 3 below describes the specific reasons for the extensions of TPS designations and redesignation, and initial designations announced in CY 20 21. There were no termination s of TPS designations in CY 20 21. Section 4.3 Extensions of Designations Under INA \u00a7 244(b)(3)(C) and Redesignation Under INA \u00a7 244(b)( 1) and (c)(I)(A) (i) This section provides details about TPS actions annou nced by the Secretary in CY 20 21 regarding foreign states for which the most recent action by the Secretary, as of December 31, 2021, was an extension of the state's existing TPS designation and also a redesignation of the state. Somalia On July 22, 2021, Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas announced via Federal Register Notice (FRN ) the extension of the TPS designation for Somalia and the redesignation of Somalia for 18 months, effective September 18, 2021, through March 17, 2023.21 The info rmation below describing the reasons for the se actions has been excerpted from the July 22 , 2021 FRN that announced the extension and redesignation . DHS has reviewed country conditions in Somalia. Based on the review, including input received from DOS , the Secretary has determined that an 18 -month extension is warranted because the ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions supporting Somalia's 2012 TPS redesignation persist. The Secretary has further determined that the con ditions support redesignating Somalia for TPS under section 244(b)(1)(A) and (C) of the Act and is changing the \"continuous residence\" and \"continuous physical presence\" dates that applicants must meet to be eligible for TPS. The ongoing armed conflict in Somalia, along with natural disasters and contagious disease outbreaks, have worsened an already severe humanitarian crisis. Since DHS last extended TPS for Somalia, a dramatic upsurge in violence, severe drought, flooding, and the spread of desert locus ts have contributed to worsening food insecurity and internal displacement.22 Moreover, an outbreak of cholera in conjunction with the COVID -19 pandemic presented major challenges for a healthcare system that had already been severely weakened by ongoing conflict. These conditions have left a large portion of the population in need of humanitarian assistance.23 Numerous factors impede the delivery of humanitarian aid, including difficulty accessing areas 21 See 86 FR 38744 (July 22 , 202 1) (18 -month extension of Somalia 's TPS designation through March 17, 202 3, and redesignation of Somalia for TPS through March 17, 2023 ). 22 Humanitarian Response Plan Somalia , The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs , February 2021, pg. 7. 23 Somalia Key Figures , The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, https://m.reliefweb.int/country/216/som?figures -display=all (last visited May 5, 2021). 12 affected by climate -related disasters, general ins ecurity, and most notably threats to aid workers and restrictions on the presence and work of humanitarian agencies. 24 The insurgent group Al -Shabaab continues to present a significant risk. Becoming bolder since early 2019, Al -Shabaab regularly attacks major towns and conducts deadly attacks on civilian and military targets alike.25 The organization continues to maintain its capability to infiltrate Mogadishu and carry out high -profile attacks.26 The group conducted a monthly average of 140 attacks be tween November 2020 and February 2021.27 The group continues to maintain a stronghold in the southern parts of Somalia, such as the Lower Juba and Lower Shabelle regions, and also retains operational military capacity in the northern federal member states of Puntland28 and Somaliland.29 Interclan30 conflicts remain a major concern, particularly in Hiiraan, Galmudug, Lower Shabelle, and Middle Shabelle regions in southern and central Somalia, and in the Sool region, bordering Puntland and Somaliland.31 Beginning in April 2020 and throughout the yea r, the area around Wanlaweyn in Lower Shabelle region saw fierce interclan fighting between clan militias.32 Civilians continue to bear the brunt of the ongoing interclan violence.33 This violence led to the destruction of property and livelihoods, inclu ding via land grabbing; limited free movement and access to humanitarian assistance; and taxation of communities (including through forced child recruitment).34 24 Humanitarian Response Plan Somalia , The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, February 2021, pg. 5 ; 2020 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Somalia , U.S. Department of State, April 7, 2021, pg. 15. 25 Felbab -Brown, Vanda, The Problem with Militias in Somalia , United Nations Center for Policy Research, 2020 pg. 120. 26 Situation in Somalia Report of the Secretary -General (November 2020 - February 2021), UN Security Council, February 17, 2021 pg. 3. 27 Situation in Somalia Report of the Secretary -General (November 2020 - February 2021), UN Security Council, February 17, 20 21, pg. 4. 28 Puntland is a region in the north -east part of Somalia that declared itself as an autonomous state in August 1998.

Generally, these IDPs --fleeing from insecurity and natural disasters in rural areas -- establish temporary settlements in abandoned areas in Mogadishu, where they pay rent to \"gatekeepers\" - the de facto managers of these informal settlements. These evictions are linked to rising land and property values, and clan power dynamics among one of the most power ful clans \u2014the Hawiye clan in the Mo gadishu area.

In October 2019, heavy rains displaced close to 270,000 people; the worst a ffected region was in Hiiraan, in central Somalia.54 In 2020, ongoing flooding events displaced 919,000 people and destroyed infrastructure, property and 144,000 hectares of agricultural fields.55 In December 2020, locust swarms began forming in central regions of Somalia,56 spreading to southern and northern regions in early 2021 and affecting close to 300,000 hectares of land and 700,000 people.57 On February 2, 2020, the Somali government declared a national state of emergency due to the impact of th e locusts.58 UNOCHA reported in February 2021 that Somalia experienced its worst desert locust upsurge in 25 years, damaging tens of thousands of hectares of cropland and pasture with potentially severe consequences for agriculture and pastoral -based livelihoods.59 In an October 2020 report, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO ) and the World Food Programme (WFP) identified Somalia as one of 20 \"acute food insecurity hotspots,\"60 and noted that Somalia is facing \"high levels of acute food insecur ity.\"61 The Food Security Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) for Somalia assessed that the \"drivers of acute food insecurity in Somalia included the compounding effects of poor and erratic rainfall distribution, flooding, 49 Somalia: Drought Conditions Update , The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, April 26, 2021. 50 Somalia Drought Update , Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, April 22, 2021 , pg. 1. 51 Somalia Drought Update , Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, April 22, 2021 , pg. 1. 52 Fact Sheet #2: Somalia - Complex Emergency , U.S. Agency for International Development, April 28, 2021, pg. 2. 53 Fact Sheet #2: Somalia - Complex Emergency , U.S. Agency for International Development, April 28, 2021, pg. 2. 54 Hundreds of thousands of people affected by floods in central Somalia , MSF, November 5, 2019. 55 Humanitarian Response Plan Somalia , The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs , February 2021, pg. 11. 56 Humanitarian Response Plan Somalia , The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs , February 2021, pg. 12. 57 Situation in Somalia Report of the Secretary -General (Nov ember 2020 - February 2021), UN Security Council, February 17, 2021 pg. 10. 58 Situation in Somalia - Report of the Secretary -General (S/2020/121) , UN Security Council, February 13, 2020, pg. 11. 59 Humanitarian Response Plan Somalia , The UN Office for the C oordination of Humanitarian Affairs , February 2021, pg. 12. 60 FAO -WFP early warning analysis of acute food insecurity hotspots: October 2020 , Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Food Programme, Nov. 2020, pg. 6. 61 FAO -WFP early warning analysis of acute food insecurity hotspots: October 2020 , Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Food Programme, Nov. 2020, pg. 13. 15 Desert Locust infestation, socioecon omic impacts of COVID -19, and conflict.\"62 As of March 2021, an estimated 2.7 million people are facing acute food insecurity.63 Moreover, in March 2021, UNOCHA also reported that in 2020 , children constitute over 60 percent of those in need in Somalia, and malnutrition rates among children remain among the worst in the world.64 COVID -19 has directly impacted Somalia's health care system, which is limited.65 In June 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) assessed that Somalia's health syste m, decimated by decades of civil war, ranked 194 out of 195 on the Global Health Security Index.66 While the global standard for healthcare workers is 25 per 100,000 people, Somalia has only two healthcare workers per 100,000 people. 67 With only 15 ICU beds for a population of more than 15 million, it is listed among the least -prepared countries in the world to detect and report epidemics, or to execute a rapid response that might mitigate further spread of disease. 68 Somalia has a lso been experiencing a cholera outbreak since December 2017, following floods that affected areas near the Jubba and Shabelle rivers in southern and central Somalia.69 According to WHO, in 2020 Somalia had 6,589 suspected cases of cholera and 33 reported deaths.70 In April 2020, flash floods caused by heavy rains led to the contamination of water sources, thus causing an increase in the number of cholera cases.71 Humanitarian organizations operating in Somalia face heightened challenges, as security constraints continued to hinder the delivery of humanitarian assistance.72 UNOCHA reported that in 2020 , \"a staggering 255 incidents occurred impacting humanitarian operations, in which 15 humanitarian workers were killed, compared to 151 incidents in 2019. \"73 In December 2019, the World Bank reported that \"[d]ecades of civil war and political fragmentation have made Somalia one of the poorest countries in Sub -Saharan Africa.

DHS has reviewed conditions in Syria. Based on the review, including input received from other U.S. Government agencies, the Secretary has determined that an 18 -month extension is warranted because the ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions supporting Syria's TPS designation remain. The protracted civil war continues to contribute to the severe humanitarian crisis in Syria and continues to demonstrate deliberate targeting of civilians, the use of chemical weapons and irregular warfare tactics, and forced con scription and use of child soldiers. The war has resulted in a sustained need for humanitarian assistance, an increase in refugees and displaced people, food insecurity, limited access to water and medical care, and a large -scale destruction of Syria's infrastructure. As further indication of the deteriorating conditions, on October 8, 2020, President Donald Trump continued for one year the national emergency with respect to Syria declared in Executive Order 13894, citing \"the actions by the Government of Turkey to conduct a military offensive into northeast Syria, undermines the campaign to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, endangers civilians, and further threatens to undermine the peace, security, and stability in the region, and co ntinues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.\" While the last documented chemical weapons attack by the Syrian government was an attack using chlorine on May 19, 2019 in Latakia prov ince that injured several civilians, in October 2020, United States Ambassador to the UN Kelly Craft stated that Syria had breached its obligation under the Chemical Weapons Convention and UN resolutions to dismantle its chemical weapons program. In addi tion to chemical weapons, according to DOS, the regime also frequently employed prohibited cluster munitions and barrel bombs. Per DOS, the Syrian Network for Human Rights78 documented at least 3,420 barrel bombs dropped by Russian and Syrian helicopters and 76 Somalia Economic Outlook , African Development Bank (last visited on May 7, 2021). 77 See 86 FR 1 4946 (March 19, 202 1) (18 -month extension o f Syria 's TPS designation through September 3 0, 202 2, and redesignation of Syria for TPS through September 30, 2022 ). 78 The Syrian Network for Human Rights is \"an independent, neutral, non -governmental, non -profit human rights organization\" which documents human rights violations in Syria. https://sn4hr.org . 17 airplanes on Idlib between April and September of 2019, often striking civilians and civilian infrastructure, including homes, medical facilities, and schools. In the last weeks of December 2020, the regime's forces dropped barrel bombs in Maaret al -Norman, resulting in the deaths of a child and a White Helmets humanitarian volunteer. DOS reported that in late 2019, regime and pro -regime forces attacked civilians in hospitals, residential areas, schools, and settlements for IDPs and refugee camps; th ese attacks included bombardment with barrel bombs in addition to the use of chemical weapons. These forces used the massacre of civilians, as well as their forced displacement, rape, starvation, and protracted sieges that occasionally forced local surrend ers, as military tactics. In late 2019, ISIS members in Syria continued to plot or inspire external terrorist operations, also according to DOS. According to the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, Syrian Gove rnment troops \"carried out air and ground attacks which decimated civilian infrastructure, depopulated towns and villages,\" killing hundreds of women, men and children\" between November of 2019 and June of 2020. In a press release related to the report, Commission Chair Paulo Pinheiro stated that, \"Children were shelled at school, parents were shelled at the market, patients were shelled at the hospital...entire families were bombarded even while fleeing. What is clear from the military campaign is that pro -government forces and UN - designated terrorists flagrantly violated the laws of war and the rights of Syrian civilians.\" According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center,79 Syria has the highest number of IDPs in the world, seeing 1.8 million new displacements in 2019, and an additional 1.5 million new displacements in the first half of 2020, mostly as a result of the regime's military offensives in the northeast and northwest areas of the country. In 2020, the United States Agency for Internation al Development (USAID) reported 6.6 million people are internally displaced within Syria, an increase of 400,000 from USAID's 2019 reports. In 2020, UNHCR registered 5,580,396 Syrian refugees in neighboring countries, representing an increase of approxima tely 10,000 refugees from 5,570,382 Syrian refugees in neighboring countries in 2019. As of September 2020, USAID reported 11.1 million people in Syria were in need of humanitarian assistance (a reduction from 11.7 million people in 2019). In September 2020, the WFP estimated that 9.3 million people in Syria are food insecure, the highest number ever recorded, as the conflict persists and \"the overall food security situation is deteriorating across the country.\" USAID reported that \"inflation, high food prices, and the worst drought in 30 years \u2014 that killed high numbers of livestock and drastically reduced crop yields in 2018 \u2014 have also contributed to food assistance needs across Syria in 2019.\" The COVID -19 pa ndemic in 2020 has also exacerbated food insecurity. In the summer of 2020, the head of the WFP assessed that, \"Syria faces the risk of mass starvation or another mass exodus unless more aid money is made available.\" DOS says that, according to UNOCHA, half of all health facilities were closed or partially functioning, and the conflict had killed hundreds of healthcare workers. 79 The Internal Displacement Monitoring Center is a non -profit organization that \" provides data and analysis and supports partners to identify and implement solutions to internal displacement. \" https://www.internal - displacement.org . 18 According to the World Bank, the conflict in Syria has continued to devastate the Syrian economy. A lack of sustained access to health care, education, housing, and food have exacerbated the effects of the conflict and pushed millions of people into unemployment and poverty. Additional information supporting the reasons for the S yria's TPS designation extension and redesignati on is provided at 86 FR 14946 (March 19, 2021). Yemen On July 9, 2021, Secretary Mayorkas announced via FRN the extension of the TPS designation for Yemen and the redesignation of Yemen for 18 months, effective September 4, 2021, through March 3, 2023.80 The information below describing the reasons for the se actions has been excerpted from the July 9 , 2021 FRN that announced the extension and redesignation . DHS has reviewed conditions in Yemen. Based on this review and after consulting with DOS, the Secretary has determined that an 18 -month extension is war ranted because the armed conflict is ongoing, and the extraordinary and temporary conditions that prompted the 2017 redesignation of Yemen persist. The Secretary has further determined that the conditions support redesignating Yemen for TPS under section 244(b)(1)(A) and (C) of the Act and changing the dates for \"continuous residence\" and \"continuous physical presence\" in the United States that applicants must meet, in addition to other requirements, to be eligible for TPS . In September 2014, the Houthi clan, with their armed wing, Ansar Alla h and forces allied with them, launched an attack on Sana'a, Yemen's capital city, and much of the surrounding areas in an attempt to remove Yemen's President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi.81 The armed conflict in Yemen es calated on March 25, 2015, when a coalition that included Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) entered the conflict with the aim of retaking the Houthis' territorial gains and returning President Hadi to power.82 Now in its seventh year, the pr otracted conflict has shown no sign of abating, as fighting between Houthi and government forces continues.83 There are 24.1 million people (approximately 80 percent of the population) in need of humanitarian assistance as a result of civil war and conf lict in Yemen.84 UNHCR has recorded 69,160 Yemeni refugees and asylum -seekers in neighboring countries.85 Over 4 million people have been internally displaced within Yemen, and 166,000 of those were displaced in 2020.86 The number of those killed since the escalation in violence in 2015 is estimated at over 233,000 80 See 86 FR 36295 (July 9 , 202 1) (18 -month extension of Yemen 's TPS designation through March 3, 202 3, and redesignation of Yemen for TPS through March 3, 2023 ). 81 The War in Yemen and the Making of a Chaos State , The Atlantic, February 3, 2018. 82 Saudi Arabia bombs Yemen, launches coalition op against Houthi rebels , Reuters, March 25, 2015. 83 Kali Robinson, Yemen's Tragedy: War, Stalemate, and Suffering , Council on Foreign Relations, Feb. 5, 2021. 84 The United Nati ons in Yemen, https://yemen.un.org/en/about/about -the-un, (last visited April 26, 2021). 85 Refugee Data Finder , The UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR, https://www.unhcr.org/refugee - statistics/download/?url=Gb4fe1 (last visited Apr. 16, 2021). 86 Operational Update: Yemen , UNHCR, April 15, 2021. 19 individuals.87 The protracted armed conflict has resulted in high levels of food insecurity, limited access to water and medical care, and the large -scale destruction of Yemen's infrastructur e and cultural heritage.88 The ongoing conflict has deepened Yemen's difficult economic and humanitarian situation. The food security situation has significantly deteriorated, with 16.2 million people experiencing food insecurity.89 The conflict has also severely impacted the delivery of basic services, including health services, water, sanitation, and education. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF ) estimates that 18 million people in Yemen (approximately 59 percent of the population) do not c urrently have access to clean water and sanitation.90 Infrastructure damage as a result of the conflict has further constrained service delivery and relief efforts, as roads, bridges, flood control systems, health facilities, airports, and schools have be en damaged or destroyed in the conflict.91 Even if a political resolution to the conflict is reached, Yemen will be faced with tremendous reconstruction needs. Additionally, thousands of landmines have been placed during the conflict, with mine clearance likely taking years to complete.92 COVID -19 has devastated what remained of Yemen's healthcare infrastructure after years of protracted conflict. In April of 2021, it was reported that a new wave of COVID infections had more than doubled the number of confirmed cases in the preceding six weeks, and that while health facilities are increasingly turning people away for lack of space and supplies, reporting mechanisms capture only a small share of cases.93 In December of 2020, it was reported th at only 51 percent of Yemen's health facilities were functioning, and the country had desperately low testing capacity for COVID -19, a total of only 700 intensive care beds, and just 500 ventilators available for a population of over 30 million people.94 In July of 2020, approximately 20 percent of the country's 333 districts had no medical doctors, with numbers continuing to decline as scores of doctors died from the virus.95 Healthcare for mothers and their babies is on the brink of collapse, with only 20 percent of the remaining healthcare facilities providing maternal and newborn healthcare as of December 2020.96 One woman and six newborns in Yemen die every two hours due to complications during pregnancy or childbirth.97 87 UN humanitarian office puts Yemen war dead at 233,000, mostly from 'indirect causes' , UN News, Dec. 1, 2020 . 88 Heritage at Risk in Yemen , UNESCO, https://en.unesco.org/galleries/heritage -risk-yemen (last visited April 16, 2021). 89 WFP Yemen Emergency Dashboard , World Food Programme, March 2021. 90 UNICEF Yemen, Water, Sanitation, Hygiene , https://www.unicef.org/ yemen/water -and-hygiene (last visited April 23, 2021). 91 Saudi -led attacks devastated Yemen's civilian infrastructure, dramatically worsening the humanitarian crisis , The Washington Post, Feb. 22, 2021. 92 Yemen: Houthi Landmines Kill Civilians, Block Aid , Human Rights Watch, April 22, 2019. 93 Under -Secretary -General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mark Lowcock: Briefing to the Security Council on the Humanitarian Situation in Yemen , United Nations Office for the Coordin ation of Humanitarian Affairs, April 15, 2021. 94 A crisis with no end in sight: How the ongoing crisis in Taiz Governorate continues to put civilians at risk , Oxfam, p. 3, Dec. 2020. 95 Agencies fear hidden cholera deaths in Yemen as Covid -19 overwhelms cli nics, The Guardian, July 28, 2020. 96 After years of conflict, Yemen remains the world's worst humanitarian crisis, a UNFPA 2021 appeal shows , Reliefweb, Dec. 7, 2020. 97 After years of conflict, Yemen remains the world's worst humanitarian crisis, a UNFPA 2 021 appeal shows , Reliefweb, Dec. 7, 2020. 20 Yemen's citizens have also been beleaguered by a cholera outbreak since 2016.98 Between October 2016 and December 2020, 2,510,806 cases of cholera were recorded in Yemen.99 COVID -19 can exacerbate death tolls in areas with cholera outbreaks, because the twin crises can overwhelm t he healthcare system, and COVID -19 outbreaks can discourage cholera patients from seeking medical attention.100 The cholera outbreak in Yemen is considered to be the worst in modern times, affecting all other major health crises, including COVID -19, and co ntributing to widespread malnutrition.101 Since March of 2020, the economy of Yemen has contracted sharply from an already low base.102 The COVID -19 pandemic depressed the worldwide oil market, which was particularly problematic for Yemen as the oil sector was previously the only large export earner in the Yemeni economy.103 Yemen's private sector has suffered greatly from the armed conflict, and the shrinking of the economy has also affected the ability of laborers to bring home wages due to an extremely u nreliable supply chain and a coercive business environment.104 Additional information supporting the reasons for the Yemen 's TPS designation extension and redesignation is provided at 86 FR 36295 (July 9 , 2021). 98 Yemen's cholera outbreak now the worst in history as millionth case looms , The Guardian, Oct. 12 , 2017. 99 Cholera Situation in Yemen, December 2020, World Health Organization, Dec. 2020. 100 Osama B.

Burma On May 25, 2021, Secretary Mayorkas announced via FRN the TPS designation for Burma for 18 months, effective May 25, 2021, through November 25, 2022.105 The information below describing the reasons for Burma 's TPS designation has been excerpted from the M ay 25 , 202 1 FRN that announced the designation . Overview On February 1, 2021, the Burmese military perpetrated a coup, deposing the democratically elected government and declaring a temporary one -year state of emergency, after which it has said it will hold elections. The military is responding with increasing oppression and violence to demonstrations and protests, resulting in large -scale human rights abuses, including arbitrary detentions and deadly force against unarmed individuals. The coup has triggered a humanitarian crisis, including the disruption of co mmunications and limited access to medical care. The Burmese military has a clear and well -documented history of committing atrocities against the people of Burma, and again, the military is committing brutal violence against the Burmese people, including young children. Political Crisis On February 1, 2021, the Burmese military seized power in a coup against the democratically elected government led by President Win Myint and State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, who were taken into custody along with ot her leaders of their party, the National League for Democracy (NLD).106 Immediately after the coup, there were disruptions of internet and cellular service, state television went off air, security checkpoints were set up in major cities, and banks suspende d services. The military has imposed a curfew across the country, from 8 p.m. until 6 a.m.107 and restricted internet and telecommunication services across the country. The military regime has also blocked social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, detained journalists for doing their work, and is drafting a cybersecurity law that will further r estrict online freedom of expression.108 These disruptions, limitations, and detentions prevent persons in Burma from obtaining timely safety information. Public protests have taken place in various parts of the country, including some that occur on a nightly basis and some with thousands of participants, in spite of the government's continued 105 See 86 FR 28132 (May 25, 202 1) (18 -month designation of Burma for TPS through November 25, 2022 ). 106 \"Myanmar military seizes power, detains elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, \" Reuters, Feb. 1, 2021. 107 \"Myanmar's military stages coup d'etat: Live news, \" Al-Jazeera, Feb. 1, 2021. 108 \"Myanmar coup: Teachers join growing protests against military \", BBC News, Feb. 5. 2021; Myanmar: \"A coup is worse than covid.

Airport, bank, and health care workers have gone on strike.111 To curb protests, on February 8, the military declared a curfew in 36 townships and major cities, dramatically expanding the ability of security forc es to arbitrarily arrest and detain individuals, search homes, and use force against people congregating peacefully in groups of five or more.112 In addition, the military has released more than 20,000 convicted prisoners in what some civil society contact s report is an apparent attempt to intimidate peaceful protestors and create disorder and fear, thus enabling further military crackdowns.113 Criminal charges against State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi followed two days after the coup. Those charges, purp orted to relate to violations of import law, were \"widely seen as a pretext to keep her detained\"114 and to disqualify and/or prevent her for keeping office as an elected official. She was accused of new criminal charges on April 12.115 On March 3, the Uni ted Nations Special Envoy for Burma, Christine Schraner Burgener, warned that the situation in Burma challenges \"the stability of the region\" and could lead to a \"real war\" and stressed that \"every tool available was now needed to end the situation\" and th at \"the unity of the international community was essential.\"116 Human Rights Abuses Violence committed by police and military forces Since the coup, police and military forces steadily escalated their use of force, resulting in the injuring and killing of multiple individuals.

In late March, the military escalated its offensi ve in Karen State, launching aerial attacks that have driven more than 200,000 residents from their homes to seek shelter in the border regions.126 The military has also intensified fighting in Kachin State, after the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO) opposition to the coup and the killing of protestors.127 Humanitarian Crisis The Burmese military's history of committing atrocities to maintain and expand its control in the country have raised concerns about the possibility of escalating violence, new displacement, and ongoing and increased obstacles to the provision of humanitar ian assistance. In response to past movements against military rule, in 1988 and 2007, the military committed massacres against individuals .128 Burma's coup on February 1, 2021, has triggered a humanitarian crisis, including the disruption of communicatio ns and limited access to medical care. The impacts include, among other things, the closure of banks and interruptions of payments and cash withdrawal systems, as well as a reported increase in prices of basic commodities, including food, construction mat erials and fuel in some areas.129 UNOCHA reports the situation has impacted the ability of partners to respond to the needs of vulnerable communities and displaced persons in violence -affected areas. UNOCHA indicated that about 945,000 people were targete d for such assistance in 2021 .130 Among those in need of humanitarian assistance are over 330,000 IDPs within Burma.131 This includes 126,000 IDPs in camps since the 2012 violence in Rakhine State and, in northern Shan State , around 2,300 people newly disp laced in Kyaukme, Namtu and Hsipaw townships in February due to armed clashes between the MAF and ethnic armed organizations or between armed organizations.132 UNOCHA reports concerns for its own staff safety and security as well.133 Additional information supporting the reasons for Burma's TPS designation is provided at 86 FR 28132 (May 25, 2021). 125 \"Serious Threats' Ahead: Human Rights Experts Voice Concern for Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar Following Military Coup ,\" Frontline, Suffers Heavy Casualties in Attacks by Ethnic Armed Groups in Kachin State, starts ,\" The Economist, Mar. 6, 2021. 129 \"Myanmar Humanitarian Update No. 4 -2021, Feb. 25, 2021. 130 \"Relief programmes hit by ongoing crisis in Myanmar, UN humanitarian office says, \" U.N.

DHS and DOS have reviewed conditions in Haiti. Based on this review and after consulting with DOS, the Secretary has determined that an 18 -month designation is warranted because of extraordinary and temporary conditions described below. Overview Haiti is grappling with a deteriorating political crisis, violence, and a staggering increase in human rights abuses.135 Within this context, as noted by UNICEF, Haiti faces the challenges of \"rising food insecurity and malnutrition, [...] waterborne disease epidemi cs, and high vulnerability to natural hazards, all of which have been further exacerbated by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic.\"136 Context Haiti is a constitutional republic with a multiparty political system. The most recent national legislative elections were held in November 2016. Jovenel Mo\u00efse was elected as president for a five-year term and took office in February 2017. Due to political gridlock and the failure of parliament to approve an elections law and a national budget, parli amentary elections scheduled for October 2019 did not take place. In January 2020, parliament lapsed, leaving only 10 senators and no deputies remaining in office, and on February 7, 2020, President Mo\u00efse began to rule by decree, without a legislative bod y.137 In March 2020, President Mo\u00efse appointed Joseph Jouthe as prime minister to head a new government. The president subsequently reappointed or replaced all elected mayors throughout the country when their terms ended in July 2020. As of November 202 0, the president was the 134 See 86 FR 41863 (August 3 , 202 1) (18 -month designation of Haiti for TPS through February 3, 2023 ). This is a new designation of Haiti. The termination of the prior designation is the subject of litigation noted previously. Eligible beneficiaries under the prior Haiti designation continue to have TPS and TPS -related documentation as described in the pr eliminary injunctions issued by the Ramos and Saget federal district courts. See litigation discussion in Section 4.6 below. See also 86 FR 50725(Sept. 10, 2021). Such beneficiaries may also apply for TPS under the new designation of Haiti. 135See e.g. Charles, Jacqueline, \" Haitian Journalists Injured as Nation Plunges Deeper into Turmoil Amid Constitutional Crisis ,\" Miami Herald, Feb. 10, 2021, https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation - world/world/americas/haiti/article249163765.html and \" A Cycle of Insta on Human Rights Practices: Haiti ,\" United States Department of State, March 30, 2021, https://www.state.gov/reports/2020 -country -reports -on-human -rights -practices/haiti/ . 26 sole nationally elected leader empowered to act, as the 10 senators remaining in office were unable to conduct legislative activities due to a lack of quorum.138 President Mo\u00efse used executive decrees to schedule a vote on a new constitution June 27, 2021, and then elections for a new president and legislature on September 19, 2021. However, these moves were met with criticism from opposition parties who feared that these actions may allow President Mo\u00efse's party to retain po wer indefinitely.139 Further, the international community has expressed the need to address election -related security, transparency and logistical issues so voting can take place. For example, on March 24, 2021, the U N Security Council underscored the nee d for Haiti to address \"essential security, transparency and logistical considerations and also reiterated the urgent need to hold free, fair, transparent and credible legislative elections, overdue since October 2019.\"140 On May 24, 2021, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas -Greenfield met with President Mo\u00efse and conveyed deep concern regarding Haiti's ongoing political impasse, a lack of accountability for human rights violations, and deteriorating security conditions. Ambassador Thomas -Greenfield noted that to date, preparations for the constitutional referendum scheduled for June 27, 2021, had not been sufficiently transparent or inclusive, and reiterated that Haiti must hold free, fair, and transparent legislative and presidential electi ons in 2021.141 Human Rights Violations and Abuses President Mo\u00efse became increasingly authoritarian through reliance on executive decrees to accomplish his agenda, including the creation of an intelligence agency accountable only to the president.142 The Human Rights Component of the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights reported a staggering 333 percent increase in the number of human rights violations and abuses by law enforce ment officials and non-state actors, respectively, against the rights to life and security of person in the period between July 2018 and December 2019.143 The Miami Herald has reported \"an atmosphere of heightened tension between the government and the pre ss,\" citing as an example a February 2021 attack against journalists who were covering protests.144 Also, on February 8, 2021 Mo\u00efse 138 Id. 139 See e.g. Andre P aultre and Sarah Marsh \"The battle for democracy goes on in Haiti as Mo\u00efse gains power ,\" The Christian Science Monitor, March Security Council Presidential Statement Expresses Deep Concern over Multiple Crises in Haiti, Stressing Government's Primary Duty to Tackle Instability , United Nations Security Council Press Release, March 24, 2021 141 \"Readout of a Meeting Between Ambassador Linda Thomas -Greenfield and Haiti's President Jovenel Mo\u00efse ,\" United States Mission to the United Nations, May 24, 2021. 142 Andre Paultre and Sarah Marsh \"The battle for democracy goes on in Haiti as Mo\u00efse gains power ,\" The Christian Science Moni tor, Haiti: Their Impact on Human Rights and the State's Obligation to Protect all Citizens, United Nations Offic e of the High Commissioner for Human Rights/United National Integrated Office in Haiti, Charles, Jacqueline, \" Haitian Journalists Injured as Nation Plunges Deeper into Turmoil Amid Constitutional Crisis ,\" Miami Herald, Feb. 10, 2021, https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation - world/world/americas/haiti/article249163765.html . 27 dismissed three Supreme Court judges who had been approached by the opposition as possible interim leaders to replace Mo\u00efse and head a transitional government.145 In response to these events, the U.S. Embassy in Haiti issued a statement expressing concerns about \"any actions that risk damaging Haiti's democratic institutions.\"146 On March 24, 2021, the United Nations Security Council noted \"with concern reported violations and abuses of international human rights, including some involving the alleged use of deadly force against protesters and reported arbitrary arrests and detentions\" and called on the Government to respect the freedoms of expression and association. It also called on the Inspector General of the Haitian National Police to conduct a thorough investigation of the reported incidents.147 Serious Security Concerns Violent criminal gangs pose a growing challenge to state authority, including de facto control of territory. From 2019 to 2021 , a new federation emerged, uniting urban criminal gangs that control entire neighborhoods in the capital city of Port -au-Prince.148 DOS's Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC ) reported in 2020 that gang activity was also on the rise outside of Port-au-Prince, and noting that the last weeks in November 2020 were particularly dangerous, with 14 kidnappings reported at that time.149 In January 2021, a leading Haitian human rights organization, the Center for the Analysis and Research of Human Rights (CARDH), stated in its 2020 annual report that over a third of Haiti's voters now live in areas controlled by criminal gangs.150 In January of 2021 , USAID said, \"Security conditions ha ve deteriorated in Port -au- Prince since late November [2020] due to an increase in kidnappings and political protests.\"151 In March 2021, the UN Security Council expressed its deep concern regarding the protracted political, constitutional, humanitarian, and security crises in Haiti.152 On April 21, 2021, DOS issued a Level 4 Travel Advisory for Haiti, advising travelers not to visit Haiti because of kidnapping, crime, and civil unrest.153 Media outlets characterized Haiti as 145 Paultre, Andre , \"Haitian Protesters, Polic e Clash After President Moves Against Top Judges ,\" Reuters, Feb.

According to the report, the United Nations warned that a lack of accountability contributed to an increase in gang attacks throughout 2020, includin g attacks on Cit\u00e9 Soleil, where police resources were reportedly used on multiple occasions. 154 Sanon , Evens , and Coto , D\u00e1nica violence rattles Haiti as poverty, fear deepens ,\" The Associated Press, Haitian Prime Minister Resigns As Economic And Public Secur ity Collapse Deepens ,\" Miami NPR hell' after clergy kidn appings \"Haiti orphanage attacked by armed bandits, children sexually assaulted, \" manager says , Miami H erald, Apr. 13, violence rattles Haiti as poverty, fear deepens ,\" The Associated Press, \" Catholic officials halt activity in Haiti for 9 kidnapped ,\" The Associated Press, Apr. 21 Haiti faces 'descent into hell' after clergy kidnappings ,\" Agence in violence rattles Haiti as poverty, fear deepens ,\" The Associated Press, Rights Clinic and Observatoire Ha\u00eftien des crimes contre l'humanit\u00e9, Killing With Impunity, du/wp - content/uploads/2021/04/Killing_With_Impunity -1.pdf , April 2021. 29 In early April 2021, the Miami Herald reported on increasing violence on public transportation in Haiti, noting, \"Already driven to despair in Haiti by brutal pov erty and a paralyzing political crisis, bus drivers and commuters are now having to grapple with surging violence on the country's public transportation. Robberies and kidnappings have become a daily reality as buses get intercepted by armed gangs controll ing access to large swaths of the country.\"163 On June 10, 2021, UNOCHA reported an upsurge in deadly clashes between gangs in Port -au- Prince displaced more than 5,000 people since the beginning of June.164 According to UNOCHA, the displacement brings the overall number to some 10,000 residents who have been displaced in the past 12 months due to similar incidents.165 Starting June 24, 2021, multiple news organizations reported one of Haiti's most powerful gang leaders warned that he was launching a \"revolu tion\" against the country's business and political elites, signaling a likely further escalation of violence in Haiti.166 On July 7, 2021 a group of assailants attacked President Moise's residence and killed him. No one has claimed responsibility for the assassination. Economic Situation According to the World Bank, Haiti's economic and social development continue to be hindered by political instability, governance issues, and fragility. With a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita of $1,149.50 U.S. d ollars per year and a Human Development Index ranking of 170 out of 189 countries in 2020, Haiti remains the poorest country in the Latin America and Caribbean region and among the poorest countries in the world.167 The World Bank further reports that even before the COVID -19 pandemic, the economy was contracting and facing significant fiscal imbalances. Following a contraction of 1.7 percent in 2019 in the context of the political turmoil and social discontent, GDP contracted by an estimated 3.8 percen t in 2020, as the COVID -19 pandemic exacerbated the already weak economy and political instability.168 It further reports that past marginal gains in poverty reduction have been undone by these recent shocks, with current estimates pointing to a poverty ra te of nearly 60 percent in 2020 , compared to the last official national estimate of 58.5 percent in 2012. About two thirds of the poor live in rural areas. The welfare gap between urban and rural areas is largely due to adverse conditions for agricultura l production.169 The Congressional Research Service (CRS) reported in March 2020 that \" Public frustration with economic woes has contributed greatly to ongoing 163 Charles, Jacqueline , \"When we aren't killed, they kidnap us.'

The United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti reports that, as a result of multiple crises including political instability and COVID -19, Haiti's economy contracted by 1.2 percent in 2019. Factories are operating at reduced capacity, unemployment is rising, the Haitian gourd e continues to lose value against the United States dollar, inflation consistently exceeds 20 percent .172 On June 8, UNOCHA reported that the unprecedented level of violence and subsequent displacements as a result of gang violence is creating a host of se condary issues, such as the disruption of community -level social functioning, family separation, increased financial burdens on host families, forced school closures, loss of livelihoods and a general fear among the affected populations.173 Healthcare Situation USAID reported in January 2020 that insufficient funding, a weak health service delivery system, a lack of qualified health professionals, and the lingering impact of the 2010 earthquake and Hurricane Matthew in 2016 pose key challenges to the d elivery of healthcare services to Haiti's population.174 In March 2020, the independent humanitarian analysis organization ACAPS reported on a severe lack of healthcare services and infrastructure across the country, noting that only 31 percent of Haitians have access to healthcare services.175 Several vector - borne diseases are prevalent in Haiti, including malaria, chikungunya, dengue, and Zika.176 Diphtheria is endemic, and cases have increased in recent years.177 Treatment of these types of diseases is h ampered by a lack of healthcare infrastructure and medication, and a low vaccination rate.178 The current epidemiological situation of cholera in Haiti has improved overall, but the 170 Taft-Morales, Maureen, \" Haiti's Political and Economic Conditions ,\" Congressional Research Service (CRS) , p.5, Mar. 5, 2020 , https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R45034. pdf. 171 \"World Report 2021 - Haiti ,\" Human Rights Watch, Jan. 13, 2021, https://www.hrw.org/world - report/2021/country -chapters/haiti . 172 \"United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti: Report of the Secretary -General ,\" United Nations Security Council, pg 9, Situation Report No. 1\", OCHA, June 1 -8, 2021. 174 \"Haiti Health Fact Sheet ,\" U.S. Agency for In ternational Development (USAID), Jan. 2020, 176 Brown, Clive M. ; Ejike -King, Lacreisha; Gracia, J.

Overview Venezuela is currently facing a severe humanitarian emergency.192 Under Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's influence, 193 the country \" has been in the midst of a severe political and economic crisis for several years .\"194 Venezuela's crisis has been marked by a wide range of factors, including: economic contraction; inflation and hyperin flation; deepening poverty; high levels of unemployment; reduced access to and shortages of food and medicine; a severely weakened medical system; the reappearance or increased incidence of certain communicable diseases; a collapse in basic services; water , electricity, and fuel shortages; political polarization; institutional and political tensions; human rights abuses and repression; crime and violence; corruption; increased human mobility and displacement (including internal migration, emigration, and re turn); and the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic, among other factors.195 189 \"Haiti - Complex Emergency Fact Sheet #2, Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 ,\" U.S. Agency for Noon Briefing Highlights, United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs , 1 3574 (March 9, 202 1) (18 -month designation of Venezuela for TPS through September 9, 2022 ). 192 World Report 2021 - Venezuela , Human Rights Watch, Jan. 2021. 193 Ribando Seelke, Clare, Nelson, Rebecca M., Brown, Phillip, Margesson, Rhoda, Venezuela: Background and U.S. Relations , Congressional Research Service (CRS), Summary , Aug. 26, 2020. 194 Venezuelan Humanitarian and Refugee Crisis , Center for Disaster Philanthr opy, Jan. 18, 2021. 195 Ribando Seelke, Clare, Nelson, Rebecca M., Brown, Phillip, Margesson, Rhoda, Venezuela: Background and U.S. Relations , Congressional Research Service (CRS), Summary, Aug. 26, 2020; Venezuelan Humanitarian and Refugee Crisis , Center fo r Disaster Philanthropy, Jan. 18, 2021; Venezuela: Complex Crisis - Overview , ACAPS, Jul. 27, 2020 , https://www.acaps.org/country/venezuela/crisis/complex -crisis (last visited Feb. 2, 2021 ); Venezuela: Humanitarian Response Plan with Humanitarian Needs Ove rview 2020 , United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), p.7 -9, Jul. 2020; Detailed findings of the independent international factfinding mission on the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela , United Nations Human Rights Council, p.27, Sep. 15, 2020; Social and Jones , Katie , InSight Crime's 2020 Homicide Round -Up, InSight Crime, Jan. 29, 2021; Venezuela 2020 Crime & Safety Report , Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC), U.S. Department of State, Jul. 21, 2020 . 33 Economic Crisis Venezuela continues to suffer from a severe economic crisis. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) reported in August 2020 that \"Venezuela's economy has collapsed.\" With the largest proven oil reserves in the world, Venezuela had long been \"one of the most prosperous countries in South America.\" However, in 2014 , the country entered into an ongoing \" economic recession marked by hyperinflation, shortage s of basic goods and a collapse in public services such as electricity and water.\" Sources attribute Venezuela's economic crisis to a variety of factors, including: the crash of global oil prices; economic mismanagement; heavy government regulation of the economy and the private sector; corruption; and the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic. Political Crisis Venezuela continues to be impacted by a prolonged political crisis. Following a May 2018 electoral process that lacked legitimacy, but which Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claimed to have won, the United States and many other democracies recognized Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the interim President of Venezuela. Maduro continued to exert control over all Venezuelan institutions after January 2019, aside from the legitimately elec ted, opposition -controlled 2015 National Assembly. In elections held on December 6, 2020 \u2014which were rejected by the Organization of American States , many governments, and other international organizations as fraudulent196 \u2014supporters of Maduro won a vast m ajority of seats in the National Assembly under manipulated electoral conditions. Maduro installed a new illegitimate purported National Assembly on January 5, 2021. Human Rights While concerns about \" the deterioration of democratic institutions and th reats to freedom of speech and press in Venezuela \" have been expressed by human rights organizations for over a decade, CRS reported in August 2020 that human rights conditions are even worse under Maduro than under former President Ch\u00e1vez .197 The Independ ent International Fact -Finding Mission created by the UN Human Rights Council to investigate allegations of atrocities since 2014 concluded that there were reasonable grounds to believe that pro -government groups and high-level authorities, including Madur o, had committed violations amounting to crimes against humanity . The mission found the judiciary contributed to arbitrary arrests, impunity for egregious abuses, and denial of justice to victims .198 196 See Remarks by Bradley A. Freden, Deputy Permanent Representative of the United States OAS Permanent Council, OAS Resolution Condemns the Fraudulent Elections in Venezuela (Dec 9, 2020). 197 Ribando Seelke, Clare, Nelson, Rebecca M., Brown, Phillip, Margesson, Rhoda, Venezuela: Background and U.S. Relations , Congressional Research Service (CRS), p. 7, Aug. 26, 2020. 198OHCHR | Venezuela: UN report urges accountability for crimes against humanity (Sep 16, 2020). 34 Health Crisis Venezuela was facing a significant health crisis even before the start of the COVID -19 pandemic. According to CRS, \"overall health indicators, particularly infant and maternal mortality rates,\" had deteriorated well before the impact of the COVID -19 pande mic. In April 2019, Human Rights Watch and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health reported that \"Venezuela's health system has been in decline since 2012, with conditions worsening drastically since 2017.\" Human Rights Watch reported in May 2020 that \"Venezuela's health system has collapsed. Shortages of medications and health supplies, interruptions of basic utilities at healthcare facilities, and the emigration of healthcare workers have led to a progressive decline in healthcare operationa l capacity.\" Venezuelans also face \" severe shortages of medicines and medical supplies \"199 and \" a complex situation in which access to basic services, especially health services remain critical .\"200 Food Insecurity In an October 2020 report, FAO and WFP identified Venezuela (and Venezuelan migrants in neighboring countries) as one of 20 \" acute food insecurity hotspots \"201 in the world.202 In an April 2019 report, Human Rights Watch and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health reported that \" [h]unger, malnutrition, and severe shortages of food are widespread\" in Venezuela.203 Despite a lack of nationwide nutrition data \u2014last published by the government in 2007 \u2014the report asserted that \"a vailable evidence suggests malnutrition is high.\"204 Moreover, Human Rights Watch reported in January 2021 that , \"[b]ased on data collected prior to the pandemic, the 2020 National Survey of Life Conditions reported 8 percent of children under five acutely malnouri shed and 30 percent chronically malnourished, or stunted.\" To help address shortages of food, the Venezuelan government established the Local Committees for Supply and Production (Comit\u00e9s Locales de Abastecimiento y Producci\u00f3n - CLAP) in 2016. Accordin g to the European Asylum Support Office ( EASO ), the CLAP \"are responsible for the delivery of food and other government aid to the communities.\" However, CLAP food boxes \"do not meet the basic nutritional needs,\" and their delivery is reportedly \"inconsis tent and discretionary.\" Furthermore, EASO noted that the CLAP are reportedly used to monitor the population \u2014including the political activity of beneficiaries \u2014and \"as a tool to discriminate and harass those who oppose the government or are involved in hum an rights 199 Venezuela: Country Focus , European Asylum Support Office (EASO), p.41, Aug. 2020. 200 United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affai rs (OCHA) , Venezuela: Health 20, 2020 201 FAO -WFP early warning analysis of acute food insecurity hotspots: October 2020 , Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP), p.6, Nov. 2020. 202 FAO -WFP early warning analysis of acute food insecurity hotspots: October 2020 , Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Natio ns (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP), p.5 -6,12, Nov. 2020. 203 Venezuela's Humanitarian Emergency : Large -Scale UN Response Needed to Address Health and Food Crises , Human Rights Watch & Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, p.4, Apr. 4, 20 19. 204 Venezuela's Humanitarian Emergency : Large -Scale UN Response Needed to Address Health and Food Crises , Human Rights Watch & Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, p.4, Apr. 4, 2019. 35 advocacy.\" There have also been allegations that certain Venezuelans have been \"excluded from the list of CLAP beneficiaries because they were not government supporters.\" Access to Basic Services (Electricity, Water, Gas, etc.) Venezuela has seen a \"collapse of basic services.\"205 In a July 2020 report, OHCHR stated that \"Access and quality of basic services, such as transportation, electricity, water and sanitation, and gas, continued to deteriorate, undermining the right to an adequate stand ard of living .\"206 Venezuela also faces \"severe shortages of water.\" Further, \"a n estimated 86 percent of Venezuelans reported unreliable water service, including 11 percent who have none at all \", according to an April 2020 survey of 4,500 residents by the non -profit Venezuelan Observatory of Public Services.207 Crime and Insecurity Sources reported in mid -2020 that Venezuela has \"among the highest homicide and crime victimization rates in Latin America and the Caribbean,\" and \"one of the h ighest number [sic] of violent deaths in the region and in the world.\" While Venezuela recorded \"a substantial decrease in homicides in 2020,\" InSight Crime noted in January 2021 that \"violence is indeed still rampant\" in the country. InSight Crime also reported that \u2014per the Venezuelan Violence Observatory (Observatorio Venezolano de Violencia or OVV) \u2014\"a violence epidemic continues to plague every single state, as well as the capital district of Caracas.\" Sources have attributed recent declines in the ho micide rate to a variety of factors, including: a decrease in violence among armed structures that engage in territorial control; fewer opportunities to engage in criminal behavior due to rising poverty, emigration, and economic deterioration, among other factors; and the impact of quarantines and restrictions on movement related to the COVID -19 pandemic . In its 2020 report, the U.S. Department of State's Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) stated that \" [h]eavily armed criminals have used grenades an d assault rifles to commit crimes at banks, shopping malls, public transportation stations, and universities.\"208 Additional information supporting the reasons for Venezuela 's TPS designation is provided at 86 FR 1 3574 (March 9, 202 1). Section 4.5 Terminations Under INA \u00a7 244(b)(3)(B) The Secretary did not terminate the TPS designations of any foreign states, or parts thereof, in CY 20 21. But see discussion below on DHS' compliance with court orders that currently prevent certain TPS termination decisions made by the former Secretary or a former Acting Secretary in previous years. 205 Venezuela: Country Focus , European Asylum Support Offic e (EASO), p. 41, Aug. 2020. 206 Outcomes of the investigation into allegations of possible human right violations of the human rights to life, liberty and physical and moral integrity in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela , Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), p. 4, Jul. 2, 2020. 207 Latest on Water Shortage in Venezuela , Hispanic Oulook Magazine, June 2020. 208 Venezuela 2020 Crime & Safety Report , Department of State Overseas Security Advisory Council , July 21, 2020. 36 Section 4.6 Preliminary Injunction O rder s and Order to Stay Proceedings This section provides details about TPS actions announced by DHS in CY 20 21 to ensure its continued compliance with the preliminary injunction orders of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in Ramos, et al. v. Nielsen, et al., No. 18 -cv-01554 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 3, 2018) and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Saget, et al., v. Trump, et al., No. 18 -cv-1599 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 11, 2019), and with the order of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California to stay proceedings in Bhattarai v. Nielsen, No. 19 - cv-00731 (N. D. Cal. Mar. 12, 2019). Preliminary injunction order in Ramos v. Nielsen In its Oct ober 3, 2018 order, the U.S. District Court for the Northern Distr ict of California enjoined DHS from implementing or enforcing the determinations to terminate TPS for E l Salvador , Haiti, Nicaragua, and Sudan pending resolution of the case on the merits . 209 As a result, DHS may not effectuate the termination of TPS for these countries while the order remains in effect. The order also requires DHS to continue the validity of documentation showing lawful status and work authorization for affected, eligible TPS beneficiaries from those countries. DHS has published four FRNs , on Oct ober 31, 2018 ,210 March 1, 2019 , 211 May 10, 2019,212 November 4, 2019, 213 December 9, 2020 ,214 and September 10, 2021215 to ensure DHS ' compliance with the court 's order. On September 16, 2021, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated the Ramos preliminary injunction . Ramos, et al., v. Nielsen , et al. , No. 18 -16981(9 th Cir., Sept. 14, 2020). The plaintiffs filed a request seeking en banc review of the panel's decision and on February 16, 2001, the Ninth Circuit stayed plaintiffs' request for rehearing en banc for a 60 -day period. The stay has been extended and remains in place while the case was placed in mediation. The parties are curre ntly discussing possible terms of settlement while the case is in mediation. The district court's preliminary injunction remained in effect throughout CY 202 1, as did the Bhattarai and Saget court orders discussed below. Preliminary injunction order in Saget v. Trump On April 11, 2019, in Saget , the U.S. District Court for the Ea stern District of New York enjoined the termination of TPS for Haiti, pending a final decision on the merits of the case.

The DHS FRNs published on Oct ober 31, 2018, March 1, 2019, November 4, 2019, December 9, 2020 , and September 10 , 2021 , also addressed measures DHS took to continue TPS and TPS -related documentation for eligible beneficiaries of TPS for Haiti. See fns. 19 - 22 supra . The court order in Bhattarai v. Nielsen On May 1, 2019, DHS announced actions to ensure its compliance with the order of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California to stay proceedings in Bhattarai .216 The claims raised in Bhattarai are similar to, and will be impacted by, the resolution of the claims being litigated in Ramos v. Nielsen , et al. , No. 18 -16981(9 th Cir. Sept ember 14, 2020). For that reason, DHS stipulated that it will not implement or enforce the decision to terminate TPS for Honduras or Nepal217 pending the resolution of the Ramos appeal, or by other order of the court. Beneficiaries under the TPS designations for Honduras and Nepal will retain their TPS, provided that a noncitizen 's TPS is not withdrawn because of ineligibility.
