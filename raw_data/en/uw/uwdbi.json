Rates of hypertension treatment and control are low in China. Available 43 and affordable medications are important for successfully controlling hypertension, 44 but little is known about current patterns of access to and use of antihypertensive 45 medications in Chinese primary health care. 46 Methods. By using medication inventory data and prescriptions from a nationwide 47 cross -sectional survey, we studied the availability, cost, and prescription patterns of 48 62 antihypertensive medications at 3362 primary health care sites across 31 Chinese 49 provinces. Site variation by geography and types were also evaluated. We also 50 assessed the current use of high -value medications, defined as guideline - 51 recommended and low -cost. Finally, we evaluate the association of medication cost 52 with availability and prescription patterns. 53 Findings. Of 3362 sites, 8% stocked no antihypertensive medications; 34% stocked 54 all four classes . Village clinics and sites in the western region had the lowest 55 availability. Only 33% of all sites stocked high -value medications. Few high -value 56 medications were prescribed (11% of all sites). Higher -cost medications were more 57 likely to be prescribed than lower -cost alternat ives. 58 Interpretation. China has marked deficiencies in the availability, cost, and 59 prescription of antihypertensive medications. H igh-value medications are not 60 preferentially used . Future efforts to reduce the burden of hypertension, particularly 61 through the work of primary health care providers, will need to improve access and 62 use of antihypertensive medications, with particular attention to those with high value. 63 5 Funding. This study was funded by the Major Public Health Service Project within 64 the Minist ry of Finance of China, the National Health and Family Planning 65 Commission of China, and the Entrusted Project within the China National 66 Development and Reform Commission. 67 68 6 Research in context 69 Evidence before this study 70 71 We searched PubMed for literature in English and the China National Knowledge 72 Infrastructure (CNKI) for literature in Chinese, published before May 2016, using the 73 terms \"primary health \"hypertension\". We also 75 reviewed the references from the identified articles and the highly relevant articles 76 and reports. The awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension was found to be 77 low. The National Essenti al Medicine Program, a \"zero -profit\" policy for essential 78 medications, was implemented by all primary health care sites in 2009 to meet 79 residents' medication needs and reduce their out -of-pocket costs . However, 80 conflicting results on availability and cost were found, and few studies reported 81 prescription patterns of antihypertensive medications. Previous studies were limited to 82 specific regions, populations, and data sources. 83 84 Added value of this study 85 86 We used a national primary health care study and a screening study of high risk for 87 cardiovascular disease in China to depict the current status of availability, cost, and 88 prescription patterns of antihypertensive medications in primary health care settings in 89 China. We collected the data directly from pr imary health care sites , rather than 90 analyzing secondary data from other reports. We found marked deficiencies in 91 availability, cost, and prescription of hypertensive medications. Overall, 8% of 92 primary health care pharmacies did not stock any antihyperten sive medications. 93 Village clinics and sites in the western region had the lowest availability. High -cost 94 medications were more likely to be prescribed than low -cost medications. High -value 95 medications, those that are guideline -recommended and low -cost, wer e not 96 preferentially prescribed. 97 98 Implications of all the available evidence 99 100 Our findings suggest that interventions to improve hypertension treatment and control 101 in China will need to ensure that antihypertensive medications area adequately 102 available in primary health care settings. Implementation of the essential medicine 103 policy at the local level is currently inadequate. Use of high -value medications may 104 help to reduce the cost burden of hypertension treatment. 105 106 7 Introduction 107 An estimated 200 million adults have hypertension in China, and fewer than 15% are 108 treated.1-4 Moreover, among those who are treated, about two thirds do not achieve 109 adequate blood pressure control.5-7 Inadequate management of hypertensive patients 110 may have significant health and economic consequences: the sequelae of 111 hypertension, including stroke and heart disease, are the leading causes of morbidity 112 and mortality in China,8,9 and are associated with significant expense to patients and 113 the health system. 114 115 The successful mitigation of hypertension in China requires, in addition to lifestyle 116 and behavioral modifications, that antihypertensive medicatio ns be made available 117 and affordable, and that they be prescribed appropriately in primary health care (PHC) 118 settings, a primary point of contact with the health system in China. Recent studies 119 have suggested availability and high medication costs as major barrier to optimal 120 utilization rates and adherence to essential antihypertensive medications, especially 121 among low -income rural areas in China.10 122 123 The Chinese health reform in 2009 strengthens role of PHC that serve as gatekeepers 124 to the health care system.11 It also introduced the National Essential Medicine 125 Program that was designed to \"provide affordable and equitable basic health car e for 126 all by 2020.\" The pharmaceutical policy has also evolved quickly in recent years, 127 such as allowance for primary health care sites to procure non -essential medicines in 128 8 2014 and abolishment on the government price ceiling in 2015 (Appendix 1) . While 129 availability of medications may have increased after the National Essential Medicine 130 Policy was launched,12-14 little is known about current patterns of access to 131 antihypert ensive medications across Chinese PHC settings , where higher financial 132 burdens and limited medication choices may result in lower treatment and control 133 rates . This information is essential for developing targets for interventions that are 134 designed to improve national hypertension treatment and control. 135 136 Accordingly, to address the need for information about the availability, cost, and 137 prescription of antihypertensive medications in PHC settings across China, we 138 analyzed data from a national, government -funded study of the PHC system and a 139 large national cardiovascular screening project.15 Specifically, our study focused on 140 examining the availability, cost, and prescription of antihypertensive medications at 141 all four types of PHC sites in China. We then evaluated the availability of 142 antihypertensive medications acros s PHC sites. Finally, we determined how the costs 143 of antihypertensive medications were associated with the availability and prescription 144 of antihypertensive medications, with a particular focus on lower -cost, guideline - 145 recommended treatments. 146 147 Methods 148 Data Source and Study Sample 149 Data on the availability, cost, and prescription of antihypertensive medications were 150 9 derived from the China Patient -Centered Evaluative Assessment of Cardiac Events 151 (PEACE) Million Persons Project (MPP) PHC Survey. The design of this nationwide 152 survey, conducted from November 2016 through May 2017, has been described 153 previously.16 Briefly, we established a nationwide epidemiologic collaborative 154 network of the China PEACE MPP, which consists of 141 county/district -level 155 regions from all 31 provinces in mainland China.15 The MPP enrolled the eligible 156 study sites according to the number of residents of the catchment area, population 157 stability, local economic conditions, and geographic location. The collaborative 158 network therefore captures great diversity in geographic location, ethnicity of 159 residents, economic development, and level of urbanization. The PHC services are 160 provided by community health centre s and community health stations (one level 161 below) in urban a reas, and township health centres and village clinics (one level 162 below) in rural areas (Appendix 2). We surveyed 203 community health centre s, 401 163 community health stat ions, 284 township health centre s, and 2474 village clinics to 164 quantify the care -delivery capacity and the quality of PHC . The distribution of 165 primary health ca re study sites sampled across rural and urban areas (township health 166 centres/village clinics and community health centres/stations) reflects the national 167 ratio.17 168 169 Data on hypertension treatment and control rates were derived from the 170 cardiovascular risk screening program of the China PEACE MPP, which to date has 171 enrolled 1 \u00b77 million permanent residents, aged 35 to 75 years, who lived in 141 172 10 selected county -/district -level regions for at least 6 months in the past year. The 173 interview data of China PEACE MPP included information about the history of 174 hypertension diagnosis and treatment, collected by face -to-face administration of a 175 questionnaire. In total, 1 \u00b709 million peop le with information in the MPP lived in the 176 435 townships/communities that are the focus of this study. We linked the 177 characteristics of PHC sites with local population epidemiologic data at the 178 township/community level (i.e., one level below county/distri ct), China's 2015 179 National Census data, and geographic location information (longitude and latitude) 180 from a Chinese web mapping service ( AMAP ).18 181 182 Data Collection and Defi nitions 183 Pharmacy inventory. Lists of medications in stock at the time of the survey 184 (November to December 2016) were obtained from each participating PHC site, 185 copied, and reviewed. For each medication on the list, generic name, brand name, 186 dosage form, sp ecification, manufacturer, and retail price per sale unit were collected. 187 We cleaned and checked the reported generic names against China Pharmacopoeia 188 2015 ,19 achieving 95% in accuracy. 189 190 Prescriptions. For outpatient prescriptions (April 2015 to March 2016), we collected 191 each patient's age, gender, and diagnosis, which are routinely on the prescriptions, as 192 well as medication name, dosage, and administration. In PHC sites with an electronic 193 prescription system, relevant information was directly imported into a digital 194 11 database. For sites without electronic prescription system, we included the first 100 195 outpatient prescriptions in each 10 -day period for the 12 months in our analysis (3600 196 total prescriptions during the study period). We scanned copies, and trained staff 197 manually abstracted relevant information, with double -entry methods as a quality 198 check to ensure an accuracy standard of at least 98%. 199 200 Blood pressure measurement, hypertension treatment, and control. In MPP, blood 201 pressure was measured twice during the interview, using a unified electronic blood 202 pressure monitor (Omron HEM -7430; Omron Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) and 203 standardized procedures.20 Treatment rat e was defined as the proportion of the 204 hypertensive population who self -reported use of antihypertensive medications at the 205 baseline interview in the China PEACE MPP population; control rate was defined as 206 the proportion of the hypertensive population with a blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg 207 at the baseline interview. Treatment and control rate of hypertension were measured 208 by aggregating participant data at the township/community level. 209 210 Site characteristics. We obtained information on characteristics of each PHC site, 211 including workforce and use of information technology, through a survey of site 212 leaders and health care professionals . 213 214 Antihypertensive medications. We focused on 62 oral medications by generic names 215 listed in the database of the China Clinical G uideline for Hypertension Management 216 12 2010 regardless of whether they were recommended,2,21 and the essential medicine 217 lists.22,23 We placed each of these medications in one of eight mutually exclusive 218 pharmacologic classes, including: (1) channel blockers (CCBs), (5) diuretics, (6) fixed -dose combination medications, (7) 221 compound medications with ingredients from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), 222 and (8) centrally active drugs. Alpha -blockers and alpha -beta blockers were not 223 included because of their scarcity in the primary care sector. 224 225 We ascertained the availability of each antihypertensive medication in any dose in the 226 site pharmacy, which was calculated as the proportion of all participating sites with a 227 specific antihyp ertensive medication or medication class in stock. We calculated the 228 annual median cost for each medication, using its median price across different PHC 229 sites and the guideline -recommended dosage. 230 231 We defined high -value medications as those that satisfied these two criteria: (1) the 232 medication is recommended by the Chinese Guideline for Hypertension Management 233 in Primary Health Care 2014 ,24, 25 and (2) annual medication cost of no more than 200 234 RMB, a threshold corresponding to 1% of the average annual disposable income per 235 capita in China in 2015. The guideline recommends medicines based on clinical 236 effectiveness. We used the 2014 guideline as a framework to guide our investigation 237 of a wider range of antihypertensive medications expected for routine use . 238 13 239 Statistical Analysis 240 First, to examine availability, cost, and prescription of antihypertensive medications at 241 different types of PHC sites, we calculated percentages for categorical variables, and 242 mean and standard deviations or median and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for 243 continuous variables, as appropriate. To determine site -specific characteristics 244 associated with the availability of antihypertensive medications, we used a mixed 245 model with township/community as random effects and a logit -link function. The 246 model included a spherical covariate structure to acco unt for spatial autocorrelation 247 and differences among townships/communities. The final model included 6 248 characteristics beside type of sites and regions, i.e. density of healthcare professionals, 249 licensed physicians, physicians with a medical bachelor degr ee (5 -year medical 250 education), physician s who took continuing education course in the last year, social 251 insurances for contracted healthcare professional, healthcare professionals who 252 routinely use of IT system (Appendix 3a). 253 254 Secondary , we modeled the pre scribed medication as a function of its cost, both 255 overall and rural/urban subgroups . To address potential sampling variation and 256 imbalances in number between electronic and scanned -copy -abstracted prescriptions, 257 we adapted a resampling approach to conducting a simulation analysis with a 258 nonparametric bootstrap method.26,27 Specifically, for sc anned -copy -abstracted 259 prescription data, we randomly selected records with a sample size equal to the total 260 14 number of records; for electronic prescription data, we randomly selected a sample 261 size equal to the sample size of the scanned -copy -abstracted pres cription data. We 262 then appended the two resampled datasets together and fitted the mixed model to 263 estimate the association between the medication's prescription and its cost. We 264 repeated this process 10,000 times to obtain the distributions of the estimate d 265 associations and their 95% confidential intervals (CIs). 266 267 All analyses were conducted using SAS 9 \u00b74 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North 268 Carolina). All statistical testing was 2 -sided, at a significance level of 0 \u00b705. The Fuwai 269 Hospital Institutional Review Board approved the study; the site survey was deemed 270 exempt; informed consent was obtained from all MPP study participants. 271 272 Role of funding source 273 The funders of the study had no role in its design, data collection, data analysis, data 274 interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding and lead authors had full 275 access to all the data in the study, and all authors had final responsibility for the 276 decision to submit for publication. 277 278 Results 279 Study Sample 280 The study sample included 3362 PHC sites (18 % urban, 82% rural) across China 281 (Appendix 4). Site characteristics are shown in Table 1. Township health centre s 282 15 constituted 8% of sites, village clin ics 74%, community health centre s 6%, and 283 stations 12%. 284 285 The 435 townships/communities, which collective ly enrolled 1\u00b709 million people in 286 the China PEACE MPP, served as the study sample for determining hypertension 287 treatment and control rates. The median sample size of participants at the 288 township/community level was are 289 shown in Table 1. 290 291 Availability, Cost, and Prescription Patterns of Antihypertensive Medications 292 Among the 3362 centre s, the availability of agents by class was 76% for CCBs, 63% and 10% for 294 fixed -dose combinations (Table 2). The most commonly stocked medications in each 295 class were nifedipine and hydrochlorothiazide (6%) (Table 2). Compounds containing TCM were 298 available in 56% of the PHC pharmacies. 299 300 The pattern of medication availability varied by site. Overall, 8% of PHC pharmacies 301 did not have any diuretics; and 34% had all four classes of medications (Figure 303 1). 304 16 305 Availability , defined as having any class of medication, was associated with type of 306 site and economic region (Appendix 5), and adjusted for other PHC -specific 307 charact eristics. Township health centre s were more likely and sites in the western 308 region were less likely t o stock any kind of antihypertensive medication; village 309 clinics and sites in the western region were also less likely to have all four classes 310 (Figure 1). Urban sites prescribed ARBs more frequently than rural sites. Within rural 311 and urban sites, however, there was substantial variation in the availability of 312 medications, and no characteristic besides types of PHC sites and region was strongly 313 associated with the ir availability (Appendix 3b) . 314 315 Individual medication median annual cost per patient varied substantially (Table 2). 316 The median annual cost of the most -stocked medications in each of the most 317 commonly used classes were nifedipine extended release (412 RMB), captopril (16 318 RMB), hydrochlorothiazide (3 RMB), met oprolol (251 RMB), valsartan (663 RMB), 319 and irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide (1152 RMB). Figure 2 shows the medications 320 in value quadrants, according to their guideline -recommended status and their cost. 321 Only 33% of all sites stocked medications in the h igh-value care category. 322 323 Across 396 townships/communities, we sampled 26,159 of 518,915 hypertension 324 prescriptions. The most commonly prescribed individual medication was amlodipine; 325 the most frequently prescribed medicine classes were CCBs ARBs (5%) (Table 2). Overall, 86% of 327 prescriptions were for one medication, whereas less than 1% were for three or more 328 medications. When at least two medications were used, fixed -dose combinations 329 (39%), ACEI plus CCB (18%), and ARB plus CCB (17%) were most commonly 330 prescribed together (Appendix 6). In all, 2234 prescription records (8%) were for 331 non-guideline -recommended -value (81%) for higher -cost, gui deline -recommended medications (Figure 2). 333 334 Treatment Rates and Hypertension Control Rates 335 The sites varied by treatment and control rates (Appendix 7). The median risk - 336 standardized treatment and control rates were 35\u00b76% and 8\u00b73%, respectively. The 337 worst 1 0% of sites had risk -standardized median treatment and control rates of 4\u00b72% 338 and 1\u00b72%, respectively, whereas the best 10% had rates of 72\u00b77% and 30\u00b70%. 339 340 Cost and Availability 341 The cost of a medication was directly associated with being prescribed (Figure 3 and 342 Appendix 8), but not with its availability (Figure 3 ). On average, higher -cost 343 medications were more likely than lower -cost medications to be prescribed in PHC 344 clinics. Lower -cost medications accounted for 40\u00b75% of the medications in the 345 pharmacies. Of all the prescriptions, 12\u00b76% were for lower -cost medications and 346 4\u00b78% were for diuretics, the lowest -cost medication. 347 348 18 Discussion 349 This national study of antihypertensive medications in China reveals marked 350 deficiencies in the availability, cost, and prescription of antihypertensive medications. 351 First, hypertension medications are inconsistently available in PHC pharmacies across 352 China, and 1 in 12 pharmacies did not stock any antihypertensive medications. 353 Second, despite the availability of low -cost antihypertensive medications, higher -cost 354 medications were more often prescribed. In fact, the higher the cost of the medication, 355 the more likely that it was prescribed. The higher -cost medications did not represent 356 medications with higher efficacy. 357 358 This study adds to the literature in important ways. It is the first national study of the 359 availability, cost, and prescription of antihypertensive medications in China, involving 360 all provinces. National policies with regard to essential medications and 361 reimbursement may aim to improve access ;28 this study provides a contemporary 362 assessment of the availability and use of an tihypertensive therapies in PHC sites 363 around the country and shows that deficiencies exist at the point of care. This study 364 has the distinct strength of being based on actual investigations of the pharmacies and 365 inspection of the prescriptions. Conducting this evaluation required government 366 support, partnership with PHC providers and administrators, and site access to inspect 367 pharmacies and examine prescriptions. The study did not depend on reports from the 368 sites but, rather, involved direct data collection . Previous studies were limited to 369 19 specific regions, populations, and data sources.14,29 -32 370 371 The reasons for gaps in the availability and prescription of antihypertensive 372 medications are not clear. Chinese national policies dictate that essential medications 373 should be available and affordable. However, we un covered problems in the inventory 374 of antihypertensive medication that can be supplied to patients at PHC sites. Despite 375 the national focus on blood pressure control \u2014 and the responsibility of many of the 376 sites for hypertension management33 \u2014 a significant proportion of these pharmacies 377 either lacked any antihypertensive medication or had limited stocks , especially for 378 lower -cost medications.13 One possible contributor to our finding that low -cost, high - 379 value medications are not frequently prescribed is the zero mark -up policy. Initiated 380 in 2009, this policy prohibits health care providers from selling essential medicines at 381 prices higher than their wholesale cost. This policy reportedly exerted a large net 382 effect on the revenue of village clinics, despite increased government subsidies 383 increased to compensate for revenue loss.34,35 Some have suggested that these reforms 384 may have led to a less reliable drug supply system in China; for instance, village 385 clinics, for instance, may no longer provide essential medicines at zero mark -up due 386 to the lack of profit.36 With respect to drug prescribing patterns, there has been an 387 increase in the use of expensive medications that are not covered by the policy since 388 its implementation.10 Refinements to this policy may provide stronger incentives for 389 the use of lower cost medications . Mandating the availability of medicines may not be 390 sufficient to improve h ypertension rates, but it is arguably a necessary component of 391 20 disease management programs. Additional studies are needed to carefully examine the 392 impact from zero mark -up policies on access to antihypertensive medicines 393 throughout C hinese primary healthcare centre s.11,37 Also , some patients and doctors 394 may prefer antihypertensive TCM, though its use was generally low in our study. 395 396 The implications of this study for hypertension management in China are substantial. 397 The reality of care delivery in the clinics is not consistent with the health needs of the 398 nation, and the deficiencies in primary care pharmacies have implications for patient 399 health, as evidenced by suboptimal treatment and control rates. As such, interventions 400 to improve hypertension treatment and control will nee d to focus not only on 401 bolstering education, screening, and protocols, but also on ensuring that 402 antihypertensive medications are adequately stocked by PHC pharmacies.38 The 403 adequacy of the medication inventory is not sufficient for progress in hypertension 404 treatment and control, but it is certainly a fundamental co mponent. Policymakers will 405 need to grapple with why the aspiration of national policies is being stymied at the 406 local level and, likely, thwarting efforts by practitioners to address hypertension in 407 their patients. 408 409 The study has some other important impli cations. The use of high -value medications, 410 those that are guideline -recommended and reasonably priced, should be a priority for 411 all countries but especially for those with limited resources.39 This study finds that 412 high-value medications are not preferentially used in Chinese PHC settings, even as 413 21 the evidence for the greater efficacy of higher -priced medications is lacking.40 A 414 greater emphasis on high -value antihypertensive medications has the potential to 415 mitigate the cost burden of increasing the rates of treatment and providing more value 416 to the country. In this respect, diuretics may be particularly cost -effecti ve. Prior 417 studies have suggested that drugs such as chlorthalidone may even be superior to 418 drugs from other classes.23 In addition, too few comparative effectiveness studies of 419 antihypertensive agents have been conducted,41 and it may be beneficial for China to 420 prioritize these studies: by identifying the higher -priced medications with known 421 marginal benefits over lower -cost alternatives, they would provide the basis for high - 422 quality, cost -efficient care. 423 424 The availability of antihypertensive medications varied among types of sites and 425 economic regions, but inadequacies were not con fined to certain t ypes of centre s. Site 426 characteristics were not strongly associated with the availability of antihypertensive 427 medications. This finding indicates the need for a broad -based strategy that would 428 address problems that almost all types of PHC centre s throughout China face. 429 430 The study has several limitations. First, the study sites are not a representative sample 431 despite spanning the entire country geographically and being so large in number. The 432 treatment and control rates, however, are very similar t o national estimates.5 Second, 433 we used a convenience sample and excluded people who were not permanent 434 residents. Those who were excluded would likely have less access to care and would 435 22 likely have had even lower control rates. Nevertheless, any inaccuracies in this study 436 would be a bias toward the null, suggesting that our findings migh t even 437 underestimate the relationship. Of note, the prescription information reflects all 438 prescriptions, including those provided to migrants. Third, this study focused on 439 pharmacies in PHC sites, and people may go elsewhere for their prescriptions. 440 Howeve r, half of private pharmacies impose fees that individuals must pay out of 441 pocket.42 Therefore, we expect that most patients would have a strong preference to 442 obtain their medications from the clinic pharmacy. Future studies should build on 443 these and other emerging primary datasets in China to examine the association 444 between access to antihypertensive medicines and clinical outcomes, including 445 control rates. Fourth, our choice of the 200 RMB threshold for cost m ay be arbitrary, 446 and it's true that threshold of 1% of annual disposal income may be higher for rural 447 populations. Applying a lower cost threshold however would further restrict the 448 sample of medicines that could be defined as 'high -value', and may therefo re lower 449 the percentage of high -value drugs prescribed, further strengthening our findings. 450 Finally, the inventory and prescription data that was collected covered slightly 451 different time periods. If one assumes that any large -scale change in prescription drug 452 inventories and prescribing behaviors are marginal over the span of several months, 453 the impact on this study from similar, albeit non -overlapping time periods for data 454 collection may be negligible. 455 456 In conclusion, this study reveals key obstacles to p rogress in mitigating hypertension 457 23 in China. Despite advances in healthcare coverage and policy to limit financial risk 458 and improve health outcomes,43 this study reveals deficiencies in the availability, cost, 459 and prescription of antihypertensive medications. Future policies aimed at alleviating 460 the burden of hypertension in China, particularly through the work of PHC providers, 461 will need to improve access to high -value antihypertensive medications. 462 463 Declarati on of Interests 464 HMK discloses that he is a recipient of research agreements from Medtronic and from 465 Johnson & Johnson (Janssen), through Yale, to develop methods of clinical trial data 466 sharing; is the recipient of a grant from the Food and Drug Administration and 467 Medtronic, through Yale, to develop methods for post -market surveillance of medical 468 devices; works under contract with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to 469 develop and maintain performance measures; chairs a cardiac scientific advisory 470 board for UnitedHealth; is a participant/participant representative of the IBM Watson 471 Health Life Sciences Board; is a member of the Advisory Board for Element Science 472 and the Physician Advisory Board for Aetna; and is the founder of Hugo, a pers onal 473 health information platform.

Major polic ies about essential medications' availability and affordability since 2009 Chinese health reform in 2009 introduced the National Essential Medicine Program that was designed to \"provide affordable and equitable basic health care for all by 2020.\" It includes: 1) introduction of a national essential medicine list at primary health care level; 2) establishing province -based competitive -bidding system; 3) dispensing of essential medicines at zero mark -up, and 4) reimbursement mechanism by health insuranc e. The pharmaceutical policy has also evolved quickly in recent years, major policies about essential medications' availability and affordability since 2009 are shown as follows: Year Department Policy 2009 MOH Opinion on establishing essential medicine regime MOH National Essential Medicine List (2009) CFDA Notice on strengthening production and quality monitoring in essential medicines MIIT Notice on strengthening in supply of essential medicines MOH; NDRC; MOF Working specification in medicine procurement 2010 State council The guidance in establishing and normalizing the medicine procurement mechanism among government -sponsored primary health care sites MOH National Essential Medicine List (2012) 2012 MIIT Fixed -point production in medicines with small dosage but essential for clinical treatment 8 Ministries1 Opinion on ensuring the supply of the commonly -used low - cost medicines 2014 NHFPC Opinion on strengthening the storage and use of medicines among primary health care sites 7 Ministries2 Notice in promoting the price reform of medicines Abbreviations: MOH: Ministry of Health CFDA: China Food and Drug Administration MIIT: Ministry of Industry and Information Technology NDRC: National Development and Reform Commission NHFPC: National Health and Family Planning Commission MOF: Ministry of Finance MHRSS: Ministry of Human Resources and Society Security MOC: Ministry of Commerce CFDA: China Food and Drug Administration SATCM: State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine 41 Note: 1: NHFPC, NDRC, MIIT, CFDA 42 Appendix 2. A brief introduction of the health system in China Organization Health service institutions in China include hospitals, primary health care (PHC) institutions and specialized public health institutions (Appendix Figure 1). The primary health care system in China is divided into urban and rural components, which are org anized differently. Urban areas include community health centres and, one level below them, community health stations (i.e. local clinics). Rural areas include township health centres and, one level below them, village clinics. In 2016, primary health care institutions comprised of 94% of all health care institutions. Management The administration and management relationship between PHC institutions is relatively complex. For example, urban community health stations can either be affiliated with community health centres in the same community, or independent from them; in the latter case, however, the health stations may still receive technical support from the health centres. Similar to health stations in the urban areas, village clinics can be either affil iated with the rural township health centres, or independent from them. In some circumstances, village clinics can be private health institutions that do not fall within the government budget plan. In general, the national and local government health depar tments supervise and administer the PHC institutions. Professional disease prevention institutions such as the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provide technical support and guidance. Services Primary health care institutions in China are r esponsible for providing both basic clinical care and public health services to local residents. In 2015, they provided 4.1 billion outpatient visits and 40.3 million hospitalizations, which accounted for 55.6% and 19.2% of the total utilization in the hea lth care system. They are also the main executor of the National Essential Public Health Service Program aiming to provide 3 categories and 12 subcategories of basic public health services to all residents for free. 43 Organization of the h ealth system in China Source : This figure is cited from Meng Q et al.: People's Republic of China Health System Review; 2015.
