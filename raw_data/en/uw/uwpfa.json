All data relevant to the determination of the Annual Payment and allocations to Settling States and their Participating Subdivisions listed on Exhibit G shall be submitted to the Settlement Fund Administrator no later th an sixty (60) calendar days prior to the Payment Date for each Annual Payment. The Settlement Fund Administrator shall then determine the Annual Payment, the amount to be paid to each Settling State and its Participating Subdivisions included on Exhibit G , and the amount of any Settlement Fund Administrator costs and fees, all consistent with the provisions in Exhibit L , by: a. determining, for each Settling State, the amount o f base and incentive payments to which the State is entitled by applying the criteria under Section IV.D , Section IV.E , and Section IV.F; b. applying any suspensions, offsets, or reductions as specified under Section IV, Section XII, and Section XIII; c. applying any adjustment required as a result of prepayment or significant financial constraint, as specified under Section IV.J and Section IV.K ; d. determin ing the amount of any Settlement Fund Administrator costs and fees that exceed the available interest accrued in the Settlement Fund, as well as the amounts, if any, of such costs and fees owed by Settling Distributors and out of the Settlement Fund pursua nt to Section V.C.5 ; e. determining the total amount owed by Settling Distributors (including any amounts to be held in the Settlement Fund Escrow pending resolution of a case by a Later Litigating Subdivision as d escribed in Section XII) to all Settling States and the Participating Subdivisions listed on Exhibit G ; and f. the Settlement Fund Administrator shall then allocate, aft er subtracting the portion of any Settlement Fund Administrator costs and fees owed out of funds from the Settlement Fund pursuant to Section V.C.5 , the Annual Payment pursuant to Section V.C and Section V.D among the Settling States, among the separate types of funds for each Settling State (if applicable), and among the Participating Subdivisions listed on Exhibit G . 2. The Settlement Fund Administrator shall also apply the allocation percentages set forth in Section IV.I and determine for each Settling Distributor the amount of its allocable share of the Annual Payment. For the avoidance of doubt, each Settling Distributor's liability for its share of the Annual Payment is several, and not joint. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 15 3. As soon as possible, but no later than fifty (50) calendar days prior to the Paymen t Date for each Annual Payment and following the determination described in Section IV.B.1 and Section IV.B.2 , the Settlement Fund Administrator shall give notice to the Settling Distributors, the Set tling States, and the Enforcement Committee of the amount of the Annual Payment (including the amount of the Settlement Fund to be allocated to the Settlement Fund Administrator in costs and fees pursuant to Section V.C.5 ), the amount to be received by each Settling State, the amount to be received by the separate types of funds for each Settling State (if applicable), and the amount to be received by each Settling State's Participating Subdivisions listed on Exhibit G . The Settlement Fund Administrator shall also give notice to each Settling Distributor of the amount of its allocable share of the Annual Payment, including its allocable share of the amount of any Settlem ent Fund Administrator costs and fees that exceed the available interest accrued in the Settlement Fund pursuant to Section V.C.5 . 4. Within twenty -one (21) calendar days of the notice provided by the Settlement F und Administrator, any party may dispute, in writing, the calculation of the Annual Payment (including the amount allocated for Settlement Fund Administrator costs and fees), or the amount to be received by a Settling State and/or its Participating Subdivi sions listed on Exhibit G . Such disputing party must provide a written notice of dispute to the Settlement Fund Administrator, the Enforcement Committee, any affected Settling State, and the Settling Distributor s identifying the nature of the dispute, the amount of money that is disputed, and the Settling State(s) affected. 5. Within twenty -one (21) calendar days of the sending of a written notice of dispute, any affected party may submit a response, in writing, t o the Settlement Fund Administrator, the Enforcement Committee, any affected Settling State, and the Settling Distributors identifying the basis for disagreement with the notice of dispute. 6. If no response is filed, the Settlement Fund Administrator shall a djust the amount calculated consistent with the written notice of dispute, and each Settling Distributor shall pay its allocable share of the adjusted amount, collectively totaling that year's Annual Payment, on the Payment Date. If a written response to the written notice of dispute is timely sent to the Settlement Fund Administrator, the Settlement Fund Administrator shall notify the Settling Distributors of the preliminary amount to be paid, which shall be the greater of the amount originally calculated by the Settling Administrator or the amount that would be consistent with the notice of dispute, provided , however , that in no circumstances shall the preliminary amount to be paid be higher than the maximum amount of Base and Incentive Payments A and D f or that Payment Year as set forth on Exhibit M . For the avoidance of doubt, a transfer of suspended payments from the Settlement Fund Escrow pursuant to Section XII.A.2 does not count toward determining whether the amount to be paid is higher than the maximum amount of Base and Incentive Payments A and D for that Payment Year as set forth on Exhibit M . 7. The Settlement Fund Administrator sha ll place any disputed amount of the preliminary amount paid by the Settling Distributors into the Settlement Fund Escrow and shall disburse any undisputed amount to each Settling State and its Participating FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 16 Subdivisions listed on Exhibit G within fifteen (15) calendar days of the Payment Date or at such later time as directed by each Settling State. 8. Disputes described in this subsection shall be resolved in accordance with the terms of Section VI.F. 9. For the avoidance of doubt, no Subdivision not listed on Exhibit G shall receive an allocation from the Subdivision Fund and no provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted to create such an e ntitlement. C. Procedure for Annual Payment in Payment Years 1 and 2 . The process described in Section IV.B shall not apply to Payment Years 1 and 2. The procedure in lieu of Section IV.B.1 for Payment Years 1 and 2 is as set f orth below: 1. The Payment Date for Payment Year 1 is September 30, 2021.

In the event that, in accordance with the terms of Section VIII.A , the Settling Distributors determine not to proceed with the Settlement, or the Settlement does not become effective for any other reason, the funds held in the Settlement Fund Escrow shall immediately revert to the Settling Distributors. If the condition set forth in Section VIII.A is met, the Settlement Fund Administrator shall allocate the Annual Payment, after subtract ing the portion of Settlement Fund Administrator costs and fees owed out of funds from the Settlement Fund pursuant to Section V.C.5 , pursuant to Section V.C and Section V.D among the Settling States and their Participating Subdivisions listed on Exhibit G . The portion of any Settlement Fund Administrator costs and fees owed out of funds from the Settlement Fund pu rsuant to Section V.C.5 shall be available to the Settlement Fund Administrator for the payment of such costs and fees immediately. The remainder of the Annual Payment for Payment Year 1 shall be transferred by the Settlement Fund Administrator on the Effective Date from the Settlement Fund Escrow to the Settlement Fund and then to each Settling State and to its Initial Participating Subdivisions included on Exhibit G ; provided , however , that for any Settling State where the Consent Judgment has not been entered as of the Effective Date, the funds allocable to that Settling State and its Participating Subdivisions included on Exhibit G shall not be transferred from the Settlement Fund Escrow or disbursed until ten (10) calendar days after the entry of the Consent Judgment in that State; and, provided , further , the Settlement Fund Administrator shall leave in the Settlement Fund Escrow funds allocated to Subdivisions included on Exhibit G that are not Initial Participating Subdivisions. Should such a Subdivision become a Participating Subdivision between the Initial Participation Date a nd the Effective Date, the allocation for such Participating Subdivision shall be transferred to the Settlement Fund and paid to the Participating Subdivision at the same time as Initial Participating Subdivisions in that State are paid. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 17 2. The Payment Date for Payment Year 2 is July 15, 2022. On or before such date, the Settling Distributors shall pay into the Settlement Fund the total amount of the base payment, Incentive Payment A for the Settling States (the amount specified in Exhibit M for Payment Year 2 reduced by the allocable share of any Non -Settling States), and the Settling Distributors' allocable share of the amount of any Settlement Fund Administrator costs and fees that exceed the available interest accrued in the Settlement Fund pursuant to Section V.C.5 . The portion of any Settlement Fund Administrator costs and fees owed out of funds from the Settlement Fund pursuant to Section V.C.5 shall be available to the Settlement Fund Administrator for the payment of such costs and fees immediately. The Settlement Fund Administrator shall disburse the remaining amounts to each Settling State and to its Participating Subdivisions included on Exhibit G within fifteen (15) calendar days of the Payment Date or at such later time as directed by each Settling State. If a Settling State enacts a legislative Bar after the Initial Participation Date, but before July 15, 2022, a Subdivision that meets the requirements for becoming a Participating Subdivision under Section VII prior to July 15, 2022 (but was not an Initial Participating Subdivision) shal l be eligible to receive its allocated share (if any) for Payment Year 2, and it shall also receive any amounts allocated to it for Payment Year 1 from the Settlement Fund Escrow . 3. Any amounts remaining in the Settlement Fund Escrow for allocations to Subdivisions listed on Exhibit G that have not become Participating Subdivisions after all payments for Payment Year 2 are disbursed shall be transferred to the Settlement Fund and disbursed to the appropriate sub -funds in each Settling State pursuant to Section V.D.5 . 4. Any disputes as to the allocation of the Annual Payments in Payment Years 1 and 2 shall be resolved pursuant to the process set forth in Section IV.B.3 through Section IV.B.8 , except that in Payment Year 1, the Settlement Fund Administrator shall have until ten (10) calendar days after the Initial Participation Date to give notice of the amount to be received by each Settling State, the amount to be received by the separate types of funds for each Settling State (if applicable), and the amount to be received by each Initial Participating Subdivision in the Settling States t hat is listed on Exhibit G . D. Payment Date for Subsequent Payment Years . The Payment Date for Payment Year 3 and successive Payment Years is July 15 of the third and successive years and the Annual Payment shall be made pursuant to the process set forth in Section IV.B , except that, with respect to Payment Year 3, Settling States shall have up to the Payment Date to become eligible for Incentive Payment A and thus avoid the reductions s et forth in Section XIII. If a Settling State enacts a Bar less than sixty (60) calendar days before the Payment Date for Payment Year 3, each Settling Distributor shall pay, within thirty (30) calendar days of the Payment Year 3 Payment Date, its allocable share, pursuant to Section IV.I, of the difference between the Annual Payment as calculated by the Settlement Fund Admini strator and the amount that would have been owed had the Settlement Fund Administrator taken the Bar into account. E. Base Payments. Subject to the suspension, reduction, and offset provisions set forth in Section XII and Section XIII, the Settling Distribut ors shall collectively make base FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 18 payments equal to fifty -five percent (55%) of the Net Abatement Amount multiplied by the aggregate Overall Allocation Percentage of the Settling States. These payments will be due in installments consistent with Exhibit M over the eighteen (18) Payment Years and as adjusted by the Settlement Fund Administrator pursuant to the provisions in Section IV, Section XII, and Section XIII. F. Incentive Payments. Subject to the suspension, offset, and reduction provisions set forth in Section XII and Section XIII, the Settling Distributors shall collectively make potential additional incentive payments totaling up to a maximum of forty -five percent (45%) of the Net Abatement Amount multiplied by the aggregate Overall Allocation Perc entage of the Settling States, with the actual amount depending on whether and the extent to which the criteria set forth below are met in each Settling State. The incentive payments shall be divided among four (4) categories, referred to as Incentive Pay ments A -D. Incentive Payments A -C will be due in installments over the eighteen (18) Payment Years, and Incentive Payment D will be due in installments over thirteen (13) years beginning with Payment Year 6. The total amount of incentive payments in an A nnual Payment shall be the sum of the incentive payments for which individual Settling States are eligible for that Payment Year under the criteria set forth below. The incentive payments shall be made with respect to a specific Settling State based on it s eligibility for that year under the criteria set forth below. 1. Incentive Payment A . Incentive Payment A shall be equal to forty percent (40%) of the Net Abatement Amount multiplied by the aggregate Overall Allocation Percentage of the Settling States, pr ovided all Settling States satisfy the requirements of Incentive Payment A. Incentive Payment A will be due to a Settling State as part of the Annual Payment in each of the eighteen (18) Payment Years that a Settling State is eligible for Incentive Paymen t A and shall equal a total potential maximum of $7,421,605,477 if all States are eligible for all eighteen (18) Payment Years. Each Settling State's share of Incentive Payment A in a given year, provided that Settling State is eligible, shall equal the t otal maximum amount available for Incentive Payment A for that year as reflected in Exhibit M times the Settling State's Overall Allocation Percentage. Eligibility for Incentive Payment A is as follows: a. For the Payment Years 1 and 2, all Settling States are deemed eligible for Incentive Payment A. b. For each Payment Year other than Payment Years 1 and 2, a Settling State is eligible for Incentive Payment A if, as of sixty (60) calendar days prior to the Payment Date (exce pt that in Payment Year 3, this date is as of the Payment Date), (i) there is a Bar in that State in full force and effect, (ii) there is a Settlement Class Resolution in that State in full force and effect, (iii) the Released Claims of all of the followin g entities are released through the execution of Subdivision Settlement Participation Forms, or there is a Case -Specific Resolution against such entities: all Primary Subdivisions, Litigating Subdivisions, School Districts with a K -12 student enrollment o f at least 25,000 or .10% of a State's population, whichever is greater, and Health Districts and Hospital Districts that have at least one hundred twenty -five (125) hospital beds in one or more hospitals rendering services in that district; or (iv) a comb ination of FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 19 the actions in clauses (i) -(iii) has achieved the same level of resolution of Claims by Subdivisions ( e.g., a Bar against future litigation combined with full joinder by Litigating Subdivisions). For the avoidance of doubt, subsection (iv) cann ot be satisfied unless all Litigating Subdivisions are Participating Subdivisions or there is a Case -Specific Resolution against any such Subdivisions that are not Participating Subdivisions. The Settling Distributors and the Enforcement Committee shall m eet and confer in order to agree on data sources for purposes of this Section prior to the Preliminary Agreement Date. c. Notwithstanding Section IV.F.1.b , for each Payment Year other than Payment Years 1 and 2, a Settling State th at is not eligible for Incentive Payment A as of the Incentive Payment Final Eligibility Date shall not be eligible for Incentive Payment A for that Payment Year or any subsequent Payment Years. d. If the Settling Distributors made a payment under Incentive Payment A solely on the basis of a Bar or Settlement Class Resolution in a Settling State and that Bar or Settlement Class Resolution is subsequently removed, revoked, rescinded, reversed, overruled, interpreted in a manner to limit the scope of the release , or otherwise deprived of force or effect in any material respect, that Settling State shall not be eligible for Incentive Payment A thereafter, unless the State requalifies for Incentive Payment A through any method pursuant to Section IV.F.1.b , in which case the Settling State shall be eligible for Incentive Payment A less any litigation fees and costs incurred by Settling Distributor in the interim, except that, if the re -imposition occurs after the completion of opening statements in a trial involving a Released Claim, the Settling State shall not be eligible for Incentive Payment A (unless this exception is waived by the Settling Distributors). e. In determining the amount of Incentive Payment A that Settling Distributors will pay in a Payment Year and each Settling State's share, if any, of Incentive Payment A for that Payment Year, the Settlement Fund Administrator shall: (i) identify all Settling States that are eligible for Incentive Payment A; (ii) multiply the Overall All ocation Percentage for each such eligible Settling State by the maximum amount that Settling Distributors could owe with respect to Incentive Payment A for that Payment Year as listed on Exhibit M . The amount calculated in (ii) shall be the amount allocat ed to a Settling State eligible for Incentive Payment A for that Payment Year and the aggregate of each such amount for Settling States eligible for Incentive Payment A shall be the amount of Incentive Payment A Settling Distributors are obligated to pay i n that Payment Year, all such amounts subject to the suspension, offset, and reduction provisions in Section XII and Section XIII. 2. Incentive Payment B . Incentive Payme nt B shall be available to Settling States that are not eligible for Incentive Payment A for the applicable Payment Year. Incentive Payment B shall be equal to up to twenty -five percent (25%) of the Net Abatement Amount multiplied by the aggregate Overall Allocation Percentage of the FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 20 Settling States. Incentive Payment B will be due to a Settling State as part of the Annual Payment in each of the eighteen (18) Payment Years that a Settling State is eligible for Incentive Payment B and equal a total potenti al maximum of $4,638,503,423 if all States are eligible for all eighteen (18) Payment Years. Each Settling State's maximum share of Incentive Payment B in a given year shall equal the total maximum amount available for Incentive Payment B for that year as reflected in Exhibit M times the Settling State's Overall Allocation Percentage. Eligibility for Incentive Payment B is as follows: a. A Settling State is not eligible for Incentive Payment B for a Payment Year for which it is eligible for Incentive Payment A. b. Subject to Section IV.F.2.a , the amount of Incentive Payment B for which a Settling State is eligible in a Payment Year shall be a percentage of that State's maximum share of Incentive Payment B based on the extent to which (A) Litigating Subdivisions in the State are Participating Subdivisions or (B) there is a Case -Specific Resolution against Litigating Subdivisions in the State, collectively, \" Incentive B Eligible Subdivisions .\" The percentage of the State's maximum share of Incentive Payment B that the State is eligible for in a Payment Year shall be determined according to the table below: Percentage of Litigating Subdivision Population that is Incentive B Eligible Subdivision Population5 Incentive Payment B Eligibility Percentage Up of Subdivision Population that is Incentive B Eligible Subdivision Population\" shall be determined by the aggregate population of the Settling State's Litigating Subdi visions that are Incentive B Eligible Subdivisions divided by the aggregate population of the Settling State's Litigating Subdivisions. In calculating the Settling State's population that resides in Litigating Subdivisions, (a) the population of the Settl ing State's Litigating Subdivisions shall be the sum of the population of all Litigating Subdivisions in the Settling State, notwithstanding that persons may be included within the population of more than one Litigating Subdivision, and (b) the population that resides in Incentive B Eligible Subdivisions shall be the sum of the population of the Incentive B Eligible Subdivisions, notwithstanding that persons may be included within the population of more than one Incentive B Eligible Subdivision. An individ ual Litigating Subdivision shall not be included more than once in the numerator, and shall not be included more than once in the denominator, of the calculation regardless if it (or any of its officials) is named as multiple plaintiffs in the same lawsuit ; provided , however , that for the avoidance of doubt, no Litigating Subdivision will be excluded from the numerator or denominator under this sentence unless a Litigating Subdivision otherwise counted in the denominator has the authority to release the Cla ims (consistent with Section XI) of the Litigating Subdivision to be excluded . For the avoidance of doubt, a Settling State in which the population that resides in Incentive B Eligible Subdivisions is less than eighty -five percent ( 85%) of the population of Litigating Subdivisions shall not be eligible for any portion of Incentive Payment B. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 21 c. In determining the amount that Settling Distributors will pay in a Payment Year under Incentive Payment B and each Settling State's share of Incentive Payment B for that P ayment Year, the Settlement Fund Administrator shall: (i) identify all States that are eligible for Incentive Payment B because they are ineligible for Incentive Payment A; (ii) determine the Incentive Payment B eligibility percentage for each such Settli ng State; (iii) multiply the Incentive Payment B eligibility percentage for each such State by the Overall Allocation Percentage of that State; (iv) multiply the product from (iii) by the maximum amount that Settling Distributors could owe under Incentive Payment B for that Payment Year from Exhibit M . The amount calculated in (iv) shall be the amount allocated to a Settling State eligible for Incentive Payment B for that Payment Year, and the aggregate of such amounts for Settling States eligible for Ince ntive Payment B shall be the amount paid for that Payment Year by Settling Distributors with respect to Incentive Payment B, all such amounts subject to the suspension, offset, and reduction provisions in Section XII and Section XIII. If there are no Litigating Subdivisions in a Settling State, and that Settling State is otherwise eligible for Incentive Payment B, that Settling State will receive its full allocable shar e of Incentive Payment B. d. A Settling State's eligibility for Incentive Payment B for a Payment Year shall be determined as of sixty (60) calendar days prior to the Payment Date for that Payment Year; provided that the percentage of Incentive Payment B for which a Settling State is eligible as of the Incentive Payment Final Eligibility Date shall cap its eligibility for that Payment Year and all subsequent Payment Years. 3. Incentive Payment C . Incentive Payment C shall be available to Settling States that are not eligible for Incentive Payment A for a Payment Year, including to Settling States that are also eligible for Incentive Payment B. Incentive Payment C shall be equal to up to fifteen percent (15%) of the Net Abatement Amount multiplied by the aggregat e Overall Allocation Percentage of the Settling States. Incentive Payment C will be due to a Settling State as part of the Annual Payment in each of the eighteen (18) Payment Years that a Settling State is eligible for Incentive Payment C and equal a tota l potential maximum of $2,783,102,054 if all States are eligible for all eighteen (18) Payment Years. Each Settling State's maximum share of Incentive Payment C in a given year shall equal the total maximum amount available for Incentive Payment C for tha t year as reflected in Exhibit M multiplied by the Settling State's Overall Allocation Percentage. Eligibility for Incentive Payment C is as follows: a. A Settling State is not eligible for Incentive Payment C for a Payment Year in which it is eligible for I ncentive Payment A. b. Subject to Section IV.F.3.a, the amount of Incentive Payment C for which a Settling State is eligible in a Payment Year shall be a percentage of the State's maximum share of Incentive Payment C based on the extent to which (A) Non-Litigating Subdivisions that are Primary Subdivisions with a population FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 22 over 30,000 and Litigating Subdivisions in the State are Participating Subdivisions or (B) there is a Cas e-Specific Resolution against Non -Litigating Subdivisions that are Primary Subdivisions with a population over 30,000 and Litigating Subdivisions in the State, collectively, \" Incentive C Eligible Subdivisions .\" The percentage of the State's maximum share of Incentive Payment C that the State is eligible for in a Payment Year shall be determined according to the table below: Percentage of Relevant Subdivision Population that is Incentive C Eligible Population6 Incentive Payment C Eligibility Percentage determining the amount that Settling Distributors will pay in a Payment Year under Incentive Payment C and each Settling State's sha re of Incentive Payment C for that Payment Year, the Settlement Fund Administrator shall: (i) identify all States that are eligible for Incentive Payment C because they are ineligible for Incentive Payment A; (ii) determine the Incentive Payment C eligibi lity percentage for each such Settling State; (iii) multiply the Incentive Payment C eligibility percentage for each such State by the Overall Allocation Percentage of that State; (iv) multiply the product from (iii) by the maximum 6 The \" Percentage of Relevant Subdivision Population that is Incentive C Eligible Population \" shall be determined by the ag gregate popu lation of the Settling State's Incentive C Eligible Subdivisions divided by the aggregate population of the Settling State's Non -Litigating Primary Subdivisions with a population over 30,000 and Litigating Subdivisions (\" Incentive Payment C Sub divisions \"). None of the population figures shall include Prior Litigating Subdivisions. In calculating the Settling State's population that resides in Incentive Payment C Subdivisions, (a) the population shall be the sum of the population of all Incenti ve Payment C Subdivisions in the Settling State, notwithstanding that persons may be included within the population of more than one Incentive Payment C Subdivision, and (b) the population that resides in Incentive C Eligible Subdivisions shall be the sum of the population of the Incentive C Eligible Subdivisions, notwithstanding that persons may be included within the population of more than one Incentive C Eligible Subdivision. An individual Incentive Payment C Subdivision shall not be included more than once in the numerator, and shall not be included more than once in the denominator, of the calculation regardless if it (or any of its officials) is named as multiple plaintiffs in the same lawsuit. For the avoidance of doubt, a Settling State in which t he population that resides in Incentive C Eligible Subdivisions is less than sixty percent ( 60%) of the population of Incentive Payment C Subdivisions shall not be eligible for any portion of Incentive Payment C. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 23 amount that Settling Dis tributors could owe under Incentive Payment C for that Payment Year from Exhibit M . The amount calculated in (iv) shall be the amount allocated to a Settling State eligible for Incentive Payment C for that Payment Year and the aggregate of such amounts fo r Settling States eligible for Incentive Payment C shall be the amount paid for that Payment Year by Settling Distributors with respect to Incentive Payment C, all such amounts subject to the suspension, offset, and reduction provisions in Section XII and Section XIII. If there are no Litigating Subdivisions or Non -Litigating Subdivisions that are Primary Subdivisions with a population of more than 30,000 in a Settling State, and that Settling State is otherwise eligible for Incentive Payment C, that Settling State will receive its full allocable share of Incentive Payment C. d. A Settling State's eligibility for Incentive Payment C for a Payment Year shall be determined as of sixty (60) calendar days prior to the Payment Date for that Payment Year; provided that the percentage of Incentive Payment C for which a Settling State is eligible as of the Incentive Payment Final Eligibility Date shall cap its eligibility for that P ayment Year and all subsequent Payment Years. 4. Incentive Payment D . Incentive Payment D shall be applied at Payment Year 6. Incentive Payment D shall be equal to five percent (5%) of the Net Abatement Amount multiplied by the aggregate Overall Allocation Percentage of the Settling States. Incentive Payment D will be due to a Settling State as part of the Annual Payment for each of thirteen (13) Payment Years (from Payment Year 6 to Payment Year 18) that any Settling State is eligible for Incentive Payment D and equal a total potential maximum of $927,700,685 if all States are eligible for all thirteen (13) Payment Years. Each Settling State's share of Incentive Payment D in a given year shall equal the total maximum amount available for Incentive Payment D for that year as reflected in Exhibit M times the Settling State's Overall Allocation Percentage. Eligibility for Incentive Payment D is as follows: a. A Settling State is eligible for Incentive Payment D if there has been no Later Litigating Subdivision in that State that has had a Claim against a Released Entity survive more than six (6) months after denial in whole or in part of a Threshold Motion. b. A Settling State's eligibility for Incentive Payment D shall be determ ined as of sixty (60) calendar days prior to the Payment Date. If a Later Litigating Subdivision's lawsuit in that State survives more than six (6) months after denial in whole or in part of a Threshold Motion after that date, that State shall not be elig ible for Incentive Payment D for the Payment Year in which that occurs and any subsequent Payment Year. c. Notwithstanding Section IV.F.4, a Settling State can become re - eligible for Incentive Payment D if the lawsuit that survived a Threshold Motion is dismissed pursuant to a later motion on grounds included in the Threshold Motion, in which case the Settling State shall be eligible for Incentive Payment D FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 24 less any litigation fees and costs incurred by Settling Distributor in the interim, except that if the dismissal motion occurs after the completion of opening statements in such action, the Settling State shall not be eligible for Incentive Payment D. d. For the avoidance of dou bt, a Settling State may be eligible for Incentive Payment D whether or not it is eligible for Incentive Payments A -C. e. In determining the amount of Incentive Payment D that Settling Distributors will pay in a Payment Year and each Settling State's share, if any, of Incentive Payment D for that Payment Year, the Settlement Fund Administrator shall: (i) identify all Settling States that are eligible for Incentive Payment D; (ii) multiply the Overall Allocation Percentage for each such eligible Settling Sta te by the maximum amount that Settling Distributors could owe with respect to Incentive Payment D for that Payment Year listed on Exhibit M ; and (iii) subtract any litigation fees and costs allowed to be deducted pursuant to Section IV.F.4.c . The amount calculated in (iii) shall be the amount allocated to a Settling State eligible for Incentive Payment D for that Payment Year and the aggregate of each such amount for Settling States eligible for Incentive Payment D shall be the amount of Incentive Payment D Settling Distributors are obligated to pay in that Payment Year, all such amounts subject to the suspension, reduction, and offset provisions in Section XII and Section XIII. G. Reductions/Offsets. The base and incentive payments are subject to suspension, offset, and reduction as provided in Section XII and Section XIII. H. State -Specific Agreements . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any other agreement, in the event that: (1) the Settling Distributors enter into an agreement with any Settling State that resolves with finality such Set tling State's Claims consistent with Section XI of this Agreement and such agreement has an effective date prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement (such agreement, a \" State -Specific Agreement \") and (2) pursuant to the term s of the State -Specific Agreement, any payments, or any portion thereof, made by the Settling Distributors thereunder are made in lieu of any payments (for the avoidance of doubt, including the Additional Restitution Amount), or any portion thereof, to be made under this Agreement and the Settling Distributors make such a payment pursuant to the State -Specific Agreement, then the Settling Distributors will reduce any payments allocable to such Settling State (whether made to the Settlement Fund Escrow or th e Settlement Fund) made pursuant to this Agreement to the extent such amount was already paid pursuant to the terms of the State - Specific Agreement. I. Allocation of Payments among Settling Distributors. Payments due from the Settling Distributors under th is Section IV, Section IX , and Section X will be allocated among the Settling Distributors as follows: McKesson - 38.1%; Amerisource - 31.0%; Cardinal - 30.9%. A Settling Distributor 's sole responsibility for payments under this Agreement shall be to make its share of each payment. The obligations of the Settling Distributors in this Agreement are several and not joint. No Settling Distributor shall be responsible for any portion of another Settling Distributor's share. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 25 J. Pre-payment Option. 1. Any Settling Distributor shall have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in Section IV.J.3 , to prepay any base payment or incentive payment in whole or in part, without premium or penalty (a \" Settlement Prepayment \") by providing at least fourteen (14) calendar days prior written notice to the Settlement Fund Administrator and Enforcement Committee (a \" Prepayment Notice \"). Any Prepayment Notice shall specify: (a) the gross amount of the Settlement Prepayment (the \" Gross Settlement Amount \"), (b) the manner in which such Settlement Prepayment shall be applied to reduce such Settling Distributor's future share of Annual Payments ( i.e., to which future year(s) the allocable portion of an Annual Payment owed by such Settling Distributor the Settlement Prepayment should be applied) (such manner of application, a \" Settlement Prepayment Reduction Schedule \"), (c) the net present value of the Settlement Prepayment as of t he Prepayment Date based on the Settlement Prepayment Reduction Schedule using a discount rate equal to the prime rate as published by the Wall Street Journal on the date of the Prepayment Notice plus 1.75% (such net present value amount, the \" Net Settleme nt Prepayment Amount \"), and (d) the date on which the prepayment will be made, which shall be no more than fifteen (15) calendar days after the date of the Prepayment Notice (the \" Prepayment Date \"). 2. On the Prepayment Date the Settling Distributor shall pay the Net Settlement Prepayment Amount to the Settlement Fund and such amount shall be used only as specified in Section V. Following such payment, all future portions of the Annual Payments allocated to the appl icable Settling Distributor under Section IV.E and Section IV.F shall be reduced pursuant to the Settlement Prepayment Reduction Schedule, and the Exhibit M will be updated to give eff ect to such reduction, and going forward such updated schedule will be Exhibit M . 3. A Settling Distributor's right to make prepayments shall be subject to the following limitations: a. Prepayments may apply to base payments or to both base and incentive payment s. If the prepayment applies to both base and incentive payments, the prepayments will apply proportionately across base and incentive payments. b. A Settling Distributor shall make no more than three (3) prepayments over the eighteen (18) year payment term. A Settling Distributor shall not make more than one (1) prepayment in a five (5) year period and there shall not be prepayments made in the first two (2) Payment Years. c. Prepayments shall only be applied to one (1) or more of the three (3) Payment Years f ollowing the prepayment. d. The total amount of a prepayment of base payments after discounting calculations shall not be larger than the base payment for the Payment Year with the lowest Annual Payment amount affected by the prepayment. The FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 26 total amount of a prepayment for both base payments and incentive payments shall not be larger than the base payment and anticipated incentive payment for the lowest Payment Year affected by the prepayment. The \"anticipated incentive payment\" for a future Payment Year sh all reflect the incentives earned by each Settling State as of the time of the prepayment and any offsets or adjustments known at that time. e. In a Payment Year against which there has been a prepayment, if the amount a Settling State is calculated to receiv e is greater than the amount prepaid prior to discounting calculations, the Settling Distributor shall pay the difference. If, in a Payment Year for which there has been a prepayment, the amount that a Settling State is calculated to receive is less than the amount calculated at the time of the prepayment, there shall be a credit for the difference to the Settling Distributor to be applied in the subsequent Payment Year(s), if any. f. Prepayments shall be applied proportionately to all Settling States. 4. The Se ttling States may agree to a prepayment that does not apply these restrictions. Such a prepayment would need approval of Settling States representing at least ninety -five percent (95%) allocable share as measured by the allocations in Exhibit F; provided , however , that this provision does not limit or restrict any Settling State from negotiating its own prepayment with a Settling Distributor. 5. For illustrative purposes only, attached as Exhibit Q are examples showing a Settlement Prepayment, the related calculation of the Net Settlement Prepayment Amount, and the related adjustment to the Settlement Payment Schedule. K. Significant Financial Constraint. 1. A Settling Distributor's all ocable share of the Annual Payment for a Payment Year may, at the election of such Settling Distributor, be deferred either (a) up to the amount by which that share plus such Settling Distributor's share of amounts payable under Section IX and Section X would exceed twenty percent ( 20%) of such Settling Distributor's total operating cash flow (as determined pursuant to United States generally accepted accounting principles) for its fiscal year that concluded most recently prior to the due date for that paym ent or (b) (i) up to twenty -five percent (25%) if, as of thirty (30) calendar days preceding that payment date, the company's credit rating from one or more of the three nationally recognized rating agencies is below BBB or Baa2 or (ii) up to one hundred p ercent (100%) if, as of thirty (30) calendar days preceding that payment date, the company's credit rating from one or more of the three nationally recognized rating agencies is below BBB - or Baa3. If the reason for exceeding twenty percent (20%) of a Set tling Distributor's total operating cash flow or the decrease in credit rating is substantially attributable to the incurrence of debt to fund post -settlement acquisitions or to the payment of dividends and/or share repurchases that together are of an amou nt that exceeds the total amount of those two items for the prior fiscal year, no deferral is available . A Settling Distributor shall not be allowed to defer payment for a FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 27 Payment Year if that Settling Distributor engaged in any share repurchases in the t hree fiscal quarters prior to the Payment Date for that Payment Year. 2. If a Settling Distributor has reason to believe that it will not be able to pay some or all of its allocable share of the Annual Payment for a Payment Year, it shall provide at least n inety (90) calendar days' prior written notice to the Settlement Fund Administrator and Enforcement Committee (a \" Deferred Payment Notice \"). Any Deferred Payment Notice shall specify and include: (a) the gross amount of the payments owed (including the e stimated allocable portion of the Annual Payment, and amounts owed under Section IX and Section X, by the relevant Settling Distributor), (b) the amount that the Settling Distributor believes it will be unable to pay, (c) the accounting and audited financial documents upon which the Settling Distributor relied for making this determination, and (d) any other relevant information for the Enforcement Committee to consider. 3. A Settling Distributor shall no t utilize this provision during the first three (3) Payment Years. If a Settling Distributor defers some or all of the payments due in a Payment Year pursuant to this Section IV.K , it shall not repurchase any shares, or fund new acquisitions with an acquisition price greater than $250 million, during the deferral period until the deferred amount is fully repaid with interest. Any amounts deferred shall bear interest at an interest rate equal to the prime rate as published by th e Wall Street Journal on the date of the Deferral Payment Notice plus 0.5%. 4. The Settling Distributor shall pay all deferred amounts, including applicable interest on the next Payment Date. If the amounts previously deferred (including interest) together w ith the Settling Distributor's share of all payments due for a Payment Year would allow for a deferral under Section IV.K.1 , the Settling Distributor shall pay as much of the previously deferred amounts (including interest) as i t can pay without triggering the ability to defer payment and may defer the remainder as permitted under (and subject to the restrictions of) this Section IV.K . 5. Deferrals will apply proportionally across base pa yments and incentive payments. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section IV.K applies fully to Payment Years after the first three (3) Payment Years, including the base payments and all incentive payments due pursuant to this Ag reement during the Payment Year at issue. 6. If a Settling Distributor could pay a portion of its allocable share of the Annual Payments due pursuant to this Agreement during a Payment Year without triggering this Section IV.K , the Settling Distributor shall be required to pay that portion as scheduled and only the excess would be subject to deferral at the election of the Settling Distributor (in whole or in part) as provided herein. 7. The Settling Distributor shall pay any deferred amounts, including applicable interest on or before the date on which the payment is due for Payment Year 18. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 28 V. Allocation and Use of Settlement Payments A. Components of Settlement Fund . The Settlement Fund shall be comprised of an Abatemen t Accounts Fund, a State Fund, and a Subdivision Fund for each Settling State. The payments made under Section IV into the Settlement Fund shall be initially allocated among those three (3) sub -funds and distrib uted and used as provided below. Payments placed into the Settlement Fund do not revert back to the Settling Distributors. B. Use of Settlement Payments. 1. It is the intent of the Parties that the payments disbursed from the Settlement Fund to Settling States and Participating Subdivisions be for Opioid Remediation, subject to exceptions that must be documented in accordance with Section V.B.2 . In no event may less than eighty -five percent (85%) of the Settling Distr ibutors' maximum amount of payments pursuant to Section IV, Section IX, and Section X as set forth on Exhibit M over the entirety of all Payments Years (but not any single Payment Year) be spent on Opioid Remediation. 2. While disfavored by the Parties, a Settling State or a Participating Subdivision set forth on Exhibit G may use monies from the Settlement Fund (that have not been restricted by this Agreement solely to future Opioid Remediation) for purposes that do not qualify as Opioid Remediation. If, at any time, a Settling State or a Participat ing Subdivision set forth on Exhibit G uses any monies from the Settlement Fund for a purpose that does not qualify as Opioid Remediation, such Settling State or Participating Subdivision set forth on Exhibit G shall identify such amounts and report to the Settlement Fund Administrator and the Settling Distributors how such funds were used, including if used to pay attorneys' fees, investigation costs, litigation costs, or costs related to the operation and enforcement of this Agreement, respectively . It is the intent of the Parties that the reporting under this Section V.B.2 shall be available to the public. For the avoidance of doubt, (a) any amounts not identified under this Section V.B.2 as used to pay attorneys' fees, investigation costs, or litigation costs shall be included in the \"Compensatory Restitution Amount \" for purposes of Section VI.F and (b) Participating Subdivisions not listed on Exhibit G may only use monies from the Settlement Fund for purposes that qualify as Opioid Remediation . C. Allocation of S ettlement Fund. The allocation of the Settlement Fund allows for different approaches to be taken in different states, such as through a State -Subdivision Agreement. Given the uniqueness of States and their Subdivisions, Settling States and their Subdivis ions are encouraged to enter into State - Subdivision Agreements in order to direct the allocation of their portion of the Settlement Fund. As set out below, the Settlement Fund Administrator will make an initial allocation to three (3) state-level sub -funds. The Settlement Fund Administrator will then, for each Settling State and its Participating Subdivisions, apply the terms of this Agreement and any relevant State - Subdivision Agreement, Statutory Trust, Allocation Statute, or voluntary redistribution of funds as set out below before disbursing the funds . FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 29 1. Base Payments . The Settlement Fund Administrator will allocate base payments under Section IV.D among the Settling States in proportion to their respective Overall Allocation Percentages. Base payments for each Settling State will then be allocated fifteen percent (15%) to its State Fund, seventy percent (70%) to its Abatement Accounts Fund, and fifteen percent (15%) to its Subdivision Fund. Amounts may be reallocated and will be distributed as provided in Section V.D. 2. Incentive Payments . The Settlement Fund Administrator will treat incentive payments under Section IV.F on a State -specifi c basis. Incentive payments for which a Settling State is eligible under Section IV.F will be allocated fifteen percent (15%) to its State Fund, seventy percent (70%) to its Abatement Accounts Fund, and fifteen percent (15%) to its Subdivision Fund. Amounts may be reallocated and will be distributed as provided in Section V.D. 3. Application of Adjustments . If a suspension, offset, or reduction under Section XII or Section XIII applies with respect to a Settling State, the suspension, offset, or reduction shall be applied proportionally to all amounts that would otherwise be apportione d and distributed to the State Fund, the Abatement Accounts Fund, and the Subdivision Fund for that State. 4. Settlement Fund Administrator . Prior to the Initial Participation Date, the Settling Distributors and the Enforcement Committee will agree to a deta iled mechanism consistent with the foregoing for the Settlement Fund Administrator to follow in allocating, apportioning, and distributing payments, which shall then be appended hereto as Exhibit L . 5. Settlement Fu nd Administrator Costs . Any costs and fees associated with or arising out of the duties of the Settlement Fund Administrator as described in Exhibit L shall be paid from the interest accrued in the Settlement Fu nd Escrow and the Settlement Fund; provided , however , that if such accrued interest is insufficient to pay the entirety of any such costs and fees, Settling Distributors shall pay fifty percent (50%) of the additional amount and fifty percent (50%) shall b e paid out of the Settlement Fund. D. Settlement Fund Reallocation and Distribution . As set forth below, within a particular Settling State's account, amounts contained in the Settlement Fund sub -funds may be reallocated and distributed per a State -Subdivisi on Agreement or other means. If the apportionment of amounts is not addressed and controlled under Section V.D.1 and Section V.D.2 , then the default provisions of Section V.D.4 apply. It is not necessary that a State -Subdivision Agreement or other means of allocating funds pursuant to Section V.D.1 and Section V.D.2 address all of the Settlement Fund sub -funds. For example, a Statutory Trust might only address disbursements from a Settling State's Abatement Accounts Fund. 1. Distribution by State -Subdivision Agreement . If a Settling State has a State -Subdivision Agreement, amounts apportioned to that State's State Fund, Abatement Accounts Fund, and Subdivision Fund under Section V.C shall be reallocated and FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 30 distributed as provided by that agreement. Any State -Subdivision Agreemen t entered into after the Preliminary Agreement Date shall be applied only if it requires: (a) that all amounts be used for Opioid Remediation, except as allowed by Section V.B.2 , and (b) that at least seventy pe rcent ( 70%) of amounts be used solely for future Opioid Remediation .7 For a State -Subdivision Agreement to be applied to the relevant portion of an Annual Payment, notice must be provided to the Settling Distributors and the Settlement Fund Administrator at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to the Payment Date. 2. Distribution by Allocation Statute . If a Settling State has an Allocation Statute and/or a Statutory Trust that addresses allocation or distribution of amounts apportioned to such State's State Fund, Abatement Accounts Fund, and/or Subdivision Fund and that, to the extent any or all such sub -funds are addressed, requires (1) all amounts to be used for Opioid Remediation, except as allowed by Section V.B.2 , and (2) at least seventy percent ( 70%) of all amounts to be used solely for future Op ioid Remediation ,8 then, to the extent allocation or distribution is addressed, the amounts apportioned to that State's State Fund, Abatement Accounts Fund, and Subdiv ision Fund under Section V.C shall be allocated and distributed as addressed and provided by the applicable Allocation Statute or Statutory Trust. For the avoidance of doubt, an Allocation Statute or Statutory Trust need not ad dress all three (3) sub -funds that comprise the Settlement Fund, and if the applicable Allocation Statute or Statutory Trust does not address distribution of all or some of these three (3) sub -funds, the applicable Allocation Statute or Statutory Trust doe s not replace the default provisions described in Section V.D.4 of any such unaddressed fund. For example, if an Allocation Statute or Statutory Trust that meets the requirements of this Section V.D.2 only addresses funds restricted to abatement, then the default provisions in this Agreement concerning allocation among the three (3) sub -funds compri sing the Settlement Fund and the distribution of the State Fund and Subdivision Fund for that State would still apply, while the distribution of the applicable State's Abatement Accounts Fund would be governed by the qualifying Allocation Statute or Statut ory Trust. 3. Voluntary Redistribution . A Settling State may choose to reallocate all or a portion of its State Fund to its Abatement Accounts Fund. A Participating Subdivision included on Exhibit G may choose to reallocate all or a portion of its allocation from the Subdivision Fund to the State's Abatement Accounts Fund or to another Participating Subdivision. For a voluntary redistribution to be applied to the relevant portion of an Annual Payment, notice must be provided to the Settling Distributors and the Settlement Fund Administrator at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to the Payment Date. 4. Distribution in the Absence of a State -Subdivision Agreement, Allocation Statute, or Statutory Trust . If Section V.D.1 and Section V.D.2 do not apply, amounts 7 Future Opioid Remediation includes amount s paid to satisfy any future demand by another governmental entity to make a required reimbursement in connection with the past care and treatment of a person related to the Alleged Harms . 8 Future Opioid Remediation includes amounts paid to satisfy any fu ture demand by another governmental entity to make a required reimbursement in connection with the past care and treatment of a person related to the Alleged Harms . FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 31 apportioned to that State's State Fund, Abatement Accounts Fund, and Subdivision Fund under Section V.C shall be distributed as follows: a. Amounts apportioned to that State's State Fund shall be distributed to that State. b. Amounts apportioned to that State's Abatement Accounts Fund shall be distributed consistent with Section V.E. Each Settling State shall submit to the Settlement Fund Administrator a designation of a lead state agency or other entity to serve as the single point of contact for that Settling State's funding requests from the Abatement Accounts Fund and othe r communications with the Settlement Fund Administrator. The designation of an individual entity is for administrative purposes only and such designation shall not limit funding to such entity or even require that such entity receive funds from this Agree ment. The designated entity shall be the only entity authorized to request funds from the Settlement Fund Administrator to be disbursed from that Settling State's Abatement Accounts Fund. If a Settling State has established a Statutory Trust then that Se ttling State's single point of contact may direct the Settlement Fund Administrator to release the State's Abatement Accounts Fund to the Statutory Trust. c. Amounts apportioned to that State's Subdivision Fund shall be distributed to Participating Subdivisio ns in that State included on Exhibit G per the Subdivision Allocation Percentage listed in Exhibit G . Section VII.I shall govern amounts th at would otherwise be distributed to Non -Participating Subdivisions listed in Exhibit G . For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, no Non -Participating Subdivision wil l receive any amount from the Settlement Fund, regardless of whether such Subdivision is included on Exhibit G . d. Special Districts shall not be allocated funds from the Subdivision Fund, except through a voluntary redistribution allowed by Section V.D.3 . A Settling State may allocate funds from its State Fund or Abatement Accounts Fund for Special Districts. 5. Restrictions on Distribution . No amounts may be distributed from the Subdivisi on Fund contrary to Section VII, i.e., no amounts may be distributed directly to Non-Participating Subdivisions or to Later Participating Subdivisions to the extent such a distribution would violate Section VII.E through Section VII.H . Amounts allocated to the Subdivision Fund that cannot be distributed by virtue of the preceding sentence shall be distributed into the sub -account in the Abatement Accounts Fu nd for the Settling State in which the Subdivision is located, unless those payments are redirected elsewhere by a State -Subdivision Agreement described in Section V.D.1 or by an Allocation Statute or a Statutory Trust described in Section V.D.2 . E. Provisions Regarding the Abatement Accounts Fund. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 32 1. State -Subdivision Agreement, Allocation Statute, and Statutory Trust Fund Provisions . A State -Subdivision Agreement, Allocatio n Statute, or Statutory Trust may govern the operation and use of amounts in that State's Abatement Accounts Fund so long as it complies with the requirements of Section V.D.1 or Section V.D.2 , as applicable, and all direct payments to Subdivisions comply with Section VII.E through Section VII.H . 2. Absence of a State -Subdivision Agreement, Allocation Statute, or Statu tory Trust . In the absence of a State -Subdivision Agreement, Allocation Statute, or Statutory Trust that addresses distribution, the Abatement Accounts Fund will be used solely for future Opioid Remediation9 and the following shall apply with respect to a Settling State: a. Regional Remediation. (i) At least fifty percent (50%) of distributions for remediation from a State's Abatement Accounts Fund shall be annually allocated and tracked to the regional level. A Settling State may allow the Advisory Committee es tablished pursuant to Section V.E.2.d to define its regions and assign regional allocations percentages. Otherwise, a Settling State shall (A) define its initial regions, which shall consist of one (1) or more General Purpose Subdivisions and which shall be designated by the state agency with primary responsibility for substance abuse disorder services employing, to the maximum extent practical, existing regions established in that State for opioid abuse treatment or other public health purposes; (B) assign initial regional allocation percentages to the regions based on the Subdivision Allocation Percentages in Exhibit G and an assumption that all Subdivisions included on Exhibit G will become Participating Subdivisions. (ii) This minimum regional expenditure percentage is calculated on the Settling State's initial Abatement Accounts Fund allocation and does not include any additional amounts a Settling State has directed to its Abatement Accounts Fund from its State Fund, or any other amounts directed to the fund. A Settling State may dedicate more than fifty perce nt (50%) of its Abatement Accounts Fund to the regional expenditure and may annually adjust the percentage of its Abatement Accounts Fund dedicated to regional expenditures as long as the percentage remains above the minimum amount. (iii) The Settling State ( A) has the authority to adjust the definition of the regions, and ( B) may annually revise the percentages 9 Future Opioid Remediation includes amounts paid to satisfy any future demand by another g overnmental entity to make a required reimbursement in connection with the past care and treatment of a person related to the Alleged Harms . FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 33 allocated to each region to reflect the number of General Purpose Subdivisions in each region that are Non -Participating Subdivisions. b. Subdivision Block Grants. Certain Subdivisions shall be eligible to receive regional allocation funds in the form of a block grant for future Opioid Remediation. A Participating Subdivision eligible for block grants is a county or parish (or in the case of States that do not have counties or parishes that function as political subdivisions, a city) that (1) does not contain a Litigating Subdivision or a Later Litigating Subdivision for which it has the authority to end the litigation through a release, bar or other action, (2) either (i) has a population of 400,000 or more or (ii) in the case of California has a population of 750,000 or more, and (3) has funded or otherwise managed an established health care or treatment infrastructure ( e.g., health department or similar ag ency). Each Subdivision eligible to receive block grants shall be assigned its own region. c. Small States. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section V.E.2.a , Settling States with populations under four (4) millio n that do not have existing regions described in Section V.E.2.a shall not be required to establish regions. However, such a Settling State that contains one (1) or more Subdivisions eligible for block grants un der Section V.E.2.c shall be divided regionally so that each block -grant eligible Subdivision is a region and the remainder of the state is a region. d. Advisory Committee. The Settling State shall designate an Opi oid Settlement Remediation Advisory Committee (the \" Advisory Committee \") to provide input and recommendations regarding remediation spending from that Settling State's Abatement Accounts Fund. A Settling State may elect to use an existing advisory committ ee or similar entity (created outside of a State - Subdivision Agreement or Allocation Statute); provided , however , the Advisory Committee or similar entity shall meet the following requirements: (i) Written guidelines that establish the formation and compositio n of the Advisory Committee, terms of service for members, contingency for removal or resignation of members, a schedule of meetings, and any other administrative details; (ii) Composition that includes at least an equal number of local representatives as state representatives; (iii) A process for receiving input from Subdivisions and other communities regarding how the opioid crisis is affecting their communities, their abatement needs, and proposals for abatement strategies and responses; and (iv) A process by which Advi sory Committee recommendations for expenditures for Opioid Remediation will be made to and considered by the appropriate state agencies. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 34 3. Abatement Accounts Fund Reporting . The Settlement Fund Administrator shall track and assist in the report of remediati on disbursements as agreed to among the Settling Distributors and the Enforcement Committee. F. Nature of Payment .

The completion of such meet -and-confer process is a precondition to further action regarding any such dispute . Further action concerning Section V.B.1 shall: (i) be limited to the Settling Distrib utors seeking to reduce their Annual Payments by no more than five percent (5%) of the difference between the actual amount of Opioid Remediation and the eighty -five percent (85%) threshold established in Section V.B.1 ; (ii) only reduce Annual Payments to those Settling States and their Participating Subdivisions that are below the eighty -five percent (85%) threshold established in Section V.B.1 ; and (iii) not reduce Ann ual Payments restricted to future Opioid Remediation .

National Disputes involving a Settling State, a Participating Subdivision that has enforcement rights pursuant to Section VI.A, and/or a Settling Distributor shall be resolved by the National Arbitration Panel. a. National Disputes are disputes that are not addressed by Section VI.C , and which are exceptions to Section VI.F.1 's presumption of resolution in state courts because they involve issues of interpretation of terms contained in this Agreement applicable to all Settling States without reference to a particular State's law. D isputes between a Settling State and any Participating Subdivision shall not be considered National Disputes. National Disputes are limited to the following: (i) the amount of offset and/or credit attributable to Non - Settling States or the Tribal/W. Va.

The National Arbitration Panel shall be comprised of three (3) arbitrators. One (1) arbitrator shall be chosen by the Settling Distrib utors, one (1) arbitrator shall be chosen by the Enforcement Committee with due input from Participating Subdivisions listed on Exhibit G , and the third arbitrator shall be agreed upon by the first two (2) arbitr ators. The membership of the National Arbitration Panel is intended to remain constant throughout the term of this Agreement, but in the event that replacements are required, the retiring arbitrator shall be replaced by the party that selected him/her. c. The National Arbitration Panel shall make reasonable best efforts to decide all matters within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days of filing, and in no event shall it take longer than one (1) year. d. The National Arbitration Panel shall conduct all proceedi ngs in a reasonably streamlined process consistent with an opportunity for the parties to be heard. Issues shall be resolved without the need for live witnesses where feasible, FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 39 and with a presumption in favor of remote participation to minimize the burden s on the parties. e. To the extent allowed under state law, a Settling State, a Participating Subdivision that has enforcement rights pursuant to Section VI.A, and (at any party's request) the National Arbitration Panel may certify to an appropriate state court any question of state law. The National Arbitration Panel shall be bound by a final state court determination of such a certified question. The time period for the arbitration shall be tolled during the course of the certification process. f. The arbitrators will give due deference to any authoritative interpretation of state law, including any declaratory judgment or similar relief obtained by a Settling State, a Part icipating Subdivision that has enforcement rights pursuant to Section VI.A, or Settling Distributor on a state law issue. g. The decisions of the National Arbitration Pane l shall be binding on Settling States, Participating Subdivisions, Settling Distributors, and the Settlement Fund Administrator. In any proceeding before the National Arbitration Panel involving a dispute between a Settling State and one or more Settling Distributors whose resolution could prejudice the rights of a Participating Subdivision(s) in that Settling State, such Participating Subdivision(s) shall be allowed to file a statement of view in the proceeding. h. Nothing herein shall be construed so as to limit or otherwise restrict a State from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief in state court to protect the health, safety, or welfare of its citizens. i. Each party shall bear its own costs in any arbitration or court proceeding arising under this Section VI. The costs for the arbitrators on the National Arbitration Panel shall be divided and paid equally by the disputing sides for each individual dispute, e.g., a dispute between a Settling Distributor and Settling States/Participating Subdivisions shall be split fifty percent (50%) by the Settling Distributor and fifty percent (50%) by the Settling States/Participating Subdivisions that are parties to the dispute; a dispute between a Settling State and a Participating Subdivision shall be split fifty percent (50%) by the Settling State that is party to the dispute and fifty percent (50%) by any Participating Subdivisions that are parties to the dispute. 3. Prior to initiating an action to enforce pursuant to th is Section VI.F, the complaining party must: a. Provide written notice to the Enforcement Committee of its complaint, including the provision of the Consent Judgment and/or Agreement that the practice appears to violate, as well as the basis for its interpretation of the disputed provision. The Enforcement Committee shall establish a reasonable process and timeline for obtaining additional information from the involved FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 40 parties; provided , however , that the date the Enforcement Commi ttee establishes for obtaining additional information from the parties shall not be more than forty - five (45) calendar days following the notice. The Enforcement Committee may advise the involved parties of its views on the complaint and/or seek to resolv e the complaint informally. b. Wait to commence any enforcement action until thirty (30) calendar days after the date that the Enforcement Committee establishes for obtaining additional information from the involved parties. 4. If the parties to a dispute cannot agree on the proper forum for resolution of the dispute under the provisions of Section VI.F.1 or Section VI.F.2 , a committee comprising the Enforcement Committee and sufficient representatives of the Settling Distributors such that the members of the Enforcement Committee have a majority of one (1) member will determine the forum where the dispute will be initiated within twenty - eight (28) calendar days of receiving no tification of the dispute relating to the proper forum. The forum identified by such committee shall be the sole forum for litigating the issue of which forum will hear the substantive dispute, and the committee's identification of such forum in the first instance shall not be entitled to deference by the forum selected. G. No Effect. Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to limit the Settling State's Civil Investigative Demand (\" CID\") or investigative subpoena authority, to the extent such authorit y exists under applicable state law and the CID or investigative subpoena is issued pursuant to such authority, and Settling Distributors reserve all of their rights in connection with a CID or investigative subpoena issued pursuant to such authority. VII. Part icipation by Subdivisions A. Notice. No later than fifteen (15) calendar days after the Preliminary Agreement Date, the Settling States, with the cooperation of the Settling Distributors, shall send individual written notice of the opportunity to participate in this Agreement and the requirements of participation to all Subdivisions in the Settling States that are (1) Litigating Subdivisions or (2) Non-Litigating Subdivisions listed on Exhibit G . The costs of the w ritten notice to such Subdivisions shall be paid for by the Settling Distributors. The Settling States, with the cooperation of the Settling Distributors, may also provide general notice reasonably calculated to alert Non -Litigating Subdivisions in the Set tling States to this Agreement, the opportunity to participate in it, and the requirements for participation. Such notice may include publication and other standard forms of notification, as well as notice to national state and county organizations such a s the National Association of Counties and the National League of Cities. The notice will include that the deadline for becoming an Initial Participating Subdivision is the Initial Participation Date. Nothing contained herein shall preclude a Settling St ate from providing further notice to or otherwise contacting any of its Subdivisions about becoming a Participating Subdivision, including beginning any of the activities described in this paragraph prior to the Preliminary Agreement Date. B. Requirements for Becoming a Participating Subdivision Non-Litigating Subdivisions . A Non -Litigating Subdivision in a Settling State may become a Participating FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 41 Subdivision by returning an executed Subdivision Settlement Participation Form to the Settlement Fund Administrator specifying (1) that the Subdivisi on agrees to the terms of this Agreement pertaining to Subdivisions, (2) that the Subdivision releases all Released Claims against all Released Entities, (3) that the Subdivision agrees to use monies it receives, if any, from the Settlement Fund pursuant t o the applicable requirements of Section V; provided , however , that Non -Litigating Subdivisions may only use monies originating from the Settlement Fund for purposes that qualify as Opioid Remediation , and (4) that the Subdivisi on submits to the jurisdiction of the court where the applicable Consent Judgment is filed for purposes limited to that court's role under this Agreement. The required Subdivision Settlement Participation Form is attached as Exhibit K . C. Requirements for Becoming a Participating Subdivision Litigating Subdivisions/Later Litigating Subdivisions . A Litigating Subdivision or Later Litigating Subdivision in a Settling State may become a Participating Subdivision by returning an executed Subdivision Settlement Participation Form to the Settlemen t Fund Administrator and upon prompt dismissal with prejudice of its lawsuit .

The Settlement Fund Administrator shall provide quarterly reports of this information to the parties organized by Settling State. A Litigating Subdivision or Later Litigating Subdivision may not become a Participating Subdivision after the completion of opening statements in a trial of the lawsuit it brought that includes a Released Claim ag ainst a Released Entity. D. Initial Participating Subdivisions . A Subdivision qualifies as an Initial Participating Subdivision if it meets the applicable requirements for becoming a Participating Subdivision set forth in Section VII.B or Section VII.C by the Initial Participation Date. All Subdivision Settlement Participation Forms shall be held in escrow by the Settlement Fund Administrator until the Reference Date. E. Later Participating Subdivisions. A Subdivision that is not an Initial Participating Subdivision may become a Later Participating Subdivision by meeting the applicable requirements for becoming a Participating Subdivision set forth in Section VII.B or Section VII.C after the Initial Participation Date and by agreeing to be subject to the terms of a State - Subdivision Agreement (if any) or any other structure adopted or appl icable pursuant to Sectio n V.D or Section V.E. The following provisions govern what a Later Participating Subdivision can receive (but do not apply to Initial Particip ating Subdivisions): 1. Except as provided in Section IV.C , a Later Participating Subdivision shall not receive any share of any Annual Payment due before it became a Participating Subdivision. 2. A Later Participating Subdivision tha t becomes a Participating Subdivision after July 15, 2022 shall receive seventy -five percent (75%) of the share of future base or incentive payments that it would have received had it become a Later Participating Subdivision prior to that date (unless the Later Participating Subdivision is subject to Section VII.E.3 or Section VII.E.4 ). FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 42 3. A Later Participating Subdivision that, after the Initial Participation Date, maintains a lawsuit for a Released Claim(s) against a Released Entity and has judgment entered against it on every such Claim before it became a Participating Subdivision (other than a consensual dismissal with prejudice) shall receive fifty percent (50%) of the share of future base or incentive payments that it would have received had it become a Later Participating Subdivision prior to such judgment; provided , however , that if the Subdivision appeals the judgment and the judgment is affirmed with finality before the Subdivision becomes a Participating Subdivision, the Subdivision shall not receive any share of any base payment or incentive payments. 4. A Later Participating Subdivision that becomes a Participating Subdivision while a Bar or Case -Specific Resolution involving a diff erent Subdivision exists in its State shall receive twenty -five percent (25%) of the share of future base or incentive payments that it would have received had it become a Later Participating Subdivision without such Bar or Case -Specific Resolution. F. No Inc rease in Payments . Amounts to be received by Later Participating Subdivisions shall not increase the payments due from the Settling Distributors. G. Ineligible Subdivisions . Subdivisions in Non -Settling States and Prior Litigating Subdivisions are not eligi ble to be Participating Subdivisions. H. Non-Participating Subdivisions .

I. Unpaid Allocations to Later Participating Subdivisions and Non -Participating Subdivisions . Any base payment and incentive payment s allocated pursuant to Section V.D to a Later Participating Subdivision or Non -Participating Subdivision that cannot be paid pursuant to this Section VII, including the amounts that r emain unpaid after the reductions required by Section VII.E.2 through Section VII.E.4 , will be allocated to the Abatement Accounts Fund for the Settling State in which the Subdivision is located, unle ss those payments are redirected elsewhere by a State -Subdivision Agreement or by a Statutory Trust. VIII. Condition to Effectiveness of Agreement and Filing of Consent Judgment A. Determination to Proceed With Settlement. 1. The Settling States shall confer with lega l representatives of the Participating Subdivisions listed on Exhibit G and inform the Settling Distributors no later than eighteen (18) calendar days prior to the Reference Date whether there is sufficient parti cipation to proceed with this Agreement. Within seven (7) calendar days of informing the Settling Distributors that there is sufficient participation to proceed, the Settling States will deliver all signatures and releases required by the Agreement to be provided by the Settling States to the Settling Distributors. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 43 2. If the Settling States inform Settling Distributors that there is sufficient participation, the Settling Distributors will then determine on or before the Reference Date whether there is suff icient State participation and sufficient resolution of the Claims of the Litigating Subdivisions in the Settling States (through participation under Section VII, Case -Specific Resolution(s) and Bar(s)) to proceed with this Agre ement. The determination shall be in the sole discretion of the Settling Distributors and may be based on any criteria or factors deemed relevant by the Settling Distributors. B. Notice by Settling Distributors . On or before the Reference Date, the Settling Distributors shall inform the Settling States of their determination pursuant to Section VIII.A . If the Settling Distributors determine to proceed, the Parties will proceed to file the Consent Judgments and the obligations in the Subdivision Settlement Participation Forms will be effective and binding as of the Reference Date. If the Settling Distributors determine not to proceed, this Agreement will have no further effect, any amounts placed in escrow for Payment Year 1, incl uding funds referenced in Section IV.C.1 , Section IX, Section X, and Exhibit M , shall be returned to the Settling Distributors, and all releases (including those contained in Subdivision Settlement Participation Forms) and other commitments or obligations contained herein or in Subdivision Settlement Participation Forms will be void. C. Determination of the Participation Tier . 1. On July 1, 2022, as extended by written agreement of the Settling Distributors and the Enforcement Committee , provided that Settling Distributors determine to proceed with this Agreement, the Settlement Fund Admini strator shall determine the Participation Tier. The criteria used to determine the Participation Tier are set forth in Exhibit H . Any disputes as to the determination of the Participation Tier shall be decided by the National Arbitration Panel. 2. The Participation Tier shall be redetermined by the Settlement Fund Administrator annually as of the Payment Date, beginning with Payment Year 3, pursuant to the criteria set forth in Exhibit H . 3. After Payment Year 6, the Participation Tier cannot move higher, unless this restriction is waived by the Settling Distributors. 4. In the event that a Participation Tier redetermination moves the Participation Tier higher, and that change is in whole o r in part as a result of the post - Reference Date enactment of a Bar and there is later a Revocation Event with respect to such Bar, then on the next Payment Date that is at least one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after the Revocation Event, the Partic ipation Tier shall move down to the Participation Tier that would have applied had the Bar never been enacted, unless the Bar is reinstated or all Subdivisions affected by the Revocation Event become Participating Subdivisions within one hundred eighty (18 0) calendar days of the Revocation Event. This is the sole circumstance in which, on a nationwide basis, the Participation Tier can move down. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 44 5. In the event that there is a post -Reference Date Revocation Event with respect to a Bar that was enacted in a Settling State prior to the Reference Date, then, on the next Payment Date that is at least one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after the Revocation Event, unless the Bar is reinstated or all Subdivisions affected by the Revocation Event become Particip ating Subdivisions within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days of the Revocation Event, the Participation Tier shall decrease - solely for the State in which the Revocation Event occurred - to the Participation Tier commensurate with the percentage of Li tigating Subdivisions in that State that are Participating Subdivisions and the percentage of Non -Litigating Subdivisions that are both Primary Subdivisions and Participating Subdivisions, according to the criteria set forth in Exhibit G , except that the calculations shall be performed as to that State alone. For the avoidance of doubt and solely for the calculation in this subparagraph, the Settling States Column of Exhibit H shall pl ay no role. This is the sole circumstance in which one Settling State will have a different Participation Tier than other Settling States . 6. The redetermination of the Participation Tier under Section VIII.C.2 shall not affect payments already made or suspensions, offsets, or reductions already applied. IX. Additional Restitution A. Additional Restitution Amount. Pursuant to the schedule set forth in Exhibit M and subject to the red uction specified in Section IX.B , the Settling Distributors shall pay an Additional Restitution Amount to the Settling States listed in Exhibit N . Such funds shall be paid, on the sch edule set forth on Exhibit M , on the Payment Date for each relevant Payment Year to such Settling States as allocated by the Settlement Fund Administrator pursuant to Exhibit N . B. Reduction of Additional Restitution Amount. In the event that any Non -Settling States appear on Exhibit N , the amounts owed by Settling Distributors pursuant to this Section IX shall be reduced by the allocations set forth on Exhibit N for any such Non -Settling State s. C. Use of Funds. All funds paid as an Additional Restitution Amount shall be part of the Compensatory Restitution Amount, shall be used for Opioid Remediation, except as al lowed by Section V.B.2 , and shall be governed by the same requirements as specified in Section V.F. X. Plaintiffs' Attorneys' Fees and Costs The Agreement on Attorneys' Fees, Expenses and Costs is set forth in Exhibit R and incorporated herein by reference. The Agreement on the State Outside Counsel Fee Fund and Agreement on the State Cost Fund Administration are set forth in Exhibit S and Exhibit T , respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference. XI. Release A. Scope. As of the Effective Date, the Released Entities are hereby released and foreve r discharged from all of the Releasors' Released Claims. Each Settling State (for itself and its Releasors) and Participating Subdivision hereby absolutely, unconditionally, and irrevocably FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 45 covenants not to bring, file, or claim, or to cause, assist or pe rmit to be brought, filed, or claimed, or to otherwise seek to establish liability for any Released Claims against any Released Entity in any forum whatsoever. The releases provided for in this Agreement are intended by the Parties to be broad and shall b e interpreted so as to give the Released Entities the broadest possible bar against any liability relating in any way to Released Claims and extend to the full extent of the power of each Settling State and its Attorney General to release claims. This Agr eement shall be a complete bar to any Released Claim. B. Claim -Over and Non -Party Settlement . 1. It is the intent of the Parties that: a. Released Entities should not seek contribution or indemnification (other than pursuant to an insurance contract), from other parties for their payment obligations under this Agreement; b. the payments made under this Agreement shall be the sole payments made by the Released Entities to the Releasors involving, arising out of, or related to Covered Conduct (or conduct that would be Covered Conduct if engaged in by a Released Entity); c. Claims by Releasors against non -Parties should not result in additional payments by Released Entities, whether through contribution, indemnification or any other means; and d. the Agreement meets the req uirements of the Uniform Contribution Among Joint Tortfeasors Act and any similar state law or doctrine that reduces or discharges a released party's liability to any other parties. The provisions of this Section XI.B are intended to be implemented consistent with these principles. This Agreement and the releases and dismissals provided for herein are made in good faith. 2. No Released Entity shall seek to recover for amounts paid under this Agreement b ased on indemnification, contribution, or any other theory from a manufacturer, pharmacy, hospital, pharmacy benefit manager, health insurer, third -party vendor, trade association, distributor, or health care practitioner; provided that a Released Entity s hall be relieved of this prohibition with respect to any entity that asserts a Claim - Over against it. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall prohibit a Released Entity from recovering amounts owed pursuant to insurance contracts. 3. To the extent t hat, on or after the Reference Date, any Releasor enters into a Non -Party Settlement, including in any bankruptcy case or through any plan of reorganization (whether individually or as a class of creditors), the Releasor will include (or in the case of a N on-Party Settlement made in connection with a bankruptcy case, will cause the debtor to include), unless prohibited from doing so under applicable law, in the Non-Party Settlement a prohibition on contribution or indemnity of any kind substantially equival ent to that required from the Settling Distributors in Section XI.B.2, or a release FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 46 from such Non -Released Entity in favor of the Released Entities (in a form equivalent to the releases contained in this Agreement) of any Claim -Over. The obligation to obtain the prohibition and/or release required by this subsection is a material term of this Agreement. 4. In the event that any Releasor obtains a judgment with respect to Non - Party Covered Conduct against a Non -Released Entity that does not contain a prohibition like that described in Section XI.B.3, or any Releasor files a Non -Party Covered Co nduct Claim against a Non -Released Entity in bankruptcy or a Releasor is prevented for any reason from obtaining a prohibition/release in a Non -Party Settlement as provided in Section XI.B.3, and such Non -Released Entity asserts a Claim -Over against a Released Entity, the Released Entity shall be relieved of the prohibition in Section XI.B.2 with respect to that Non -Released Entity and that Releasor and the Settling Distributors shall take the following actions to ensure that the Released Entities do not pay more with respect to Covered Conduct to Releasors or to Non -Released Entities than the amounts owed under this Settlement Agreement by the Settling Distributors: a. Settling Distributors shall notify that Releasor of the Claim -Over within sixty (60) calendar days of the assertion of the Claim -Over or sixty (60) calendar days of the Effective D ate of this Settlement Agreement, whichever is later; b. Settling Distributors and that Releasor shall meet and confer concerning the means to hold Released Entities harmless and ensure that they are not required to pay more with respect to Covered Conduct t han the amounts owed by Settling Distributors under this Agreement; c. That Releasor and Settling Distributors shall take steps sufficient and permissible under the law of the State of the Releasor to hold Released Entities harmless from the Claim -Over and en sure Released Entities are not required to pay more with respect to Covered Conduct than the amounts owed by Settling Distributors under this Agreement. Such steps may include, where permissible: (i) Filing of motions to dismiss or such other appropriate motion by Settling Distributors or Released Entities, and supported by Releasors, in response to any claim filed in litigation or arbitration; (ii) Reduction of that Releasors' Claim and any judgment it has obtained or may obtain against such Non -Released Entity by whatever amount or percentage is necessary to extinguish such Claim - Over under applicable law, up to the amount that Releasor has obtained, may obtain, or has authority to control from such Non -Released Entity; (iii) Placement into escrow of funds paid by th e Non -Released Entities such that those funds are available to satisfy the Claim -Over; FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 47 (iv) Return of monies paid by Settling Distributors to that Releasor under this Settlement Agreement to permit satisfaction of a judgment against or settlement with the Non -Released Entity to satisfy the Claim -Over; (v) Payment of monies to Settling Distributors by that Releasor to ensure they are held harmless from such Claim -Over, up to the amount that Releasor has obtained, may obtain, or has authority to control from such Non -Released Entity; (vi) Credit to the Settling Distributors under this Agreement to reduce the overall amounts to be paid under the Agreement such that they are held harmless from the Claim -Over; and (vii) Such other actions as that Releasor and Settling Distributors may devise to hold Settling Distributors harmless from the Claim -Over. d. The actions of that Releasor and Settling Distributors taken pursuant to paragraph (c) must, in combination, ensure Settling Distributors are not required to pay more with respect to C overed Conduct than the amounts owed by Settling Distributors under this Agreement. e. In the event of any dispute over the sufficiency of the actions taken pursuant to paragraph (c), that Releasor and the Settling Distributors may seek review by the Nation al Arbitration Panel, provided that, if the parties agree, such dispute may be heard by the state court where the relevant Consent Judgment was filed. The National Arbitration Panel shall have authority to require Releasors to implement a remedy that incl udes one or more of the actions specified in paragraph (c) sufficient to hold Released Entities fully harmless. In the event that the Panel's actions do not result in Released Entities being held fully harmless, Settling Distributors shall have a claim fo r breach of this Agreement by Releasors, with the remedy being payment of sufficient funds to hold Settling Distributors harmless from the Claim -Over. For the avoidance of doubt, the prior sentence does not limit or eliminate any other remedy that Settlin g Distributors may have. 5. To the extent that the Claim -Over is based on a contractual indemnity, the obligations under Section XI.B.4 shall extend solely to a Non -Party Covered Conduct Claim against a pharmacy, clinic, hospital or other purchaser or dispenser of Products, a manufacturer that sold Products, a consultant, and/or a pharmacy benefit manager or other third -party payo r. Each Settling Distributor shall notify the Settling States, to the extent permitted by applicable law, in the event that any of these types of Non -Released Entity asserts a Claim -Over arising out of contractual indemnity against it. C. Indemnification and Contribution Prohibited. No Released Entity shall seek to recover for amounts paid under this Agreement based on indemnification, contribution, or any FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 48 other theory, from a manufacturer, pharmacy, hospital, pharmacy benefit manager, health insurer, third -party vendor, trade association, distributor, or health care practitioner. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall prohibit a Released Entity from recovering amounts owed pursuant to insurance contracts. D. General Release . In connection with the r eleases provided for in this Agreement, each Settling State (for itself and its Releasors) and Participating Subdivision expressly waives, releases, and forever discharges any and all provisions, rights, and benefits conferred by any law of any State or te rritory of the United States or other jurisdiction, or principle of common law, which is similar, comparable, or equivalent to \u00a7 1542 of the California Civil Code, which reads: General Release; extent . A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party. A Releasor may h ereafter discover facts other than or different from those which it knows, believes, or assumes to be true with respect to the Released Claims, but each Settling State (for itself and its Releasors) and Participating Subdivision hereby expressly waives and fully, finally, and forever settles, releases and discharges, upon the Effective Date, any and all Released Claims that may exist as of such date but which Releasors do not know or suspect to exist, whether through ignorance, oversight, error, negligence or through no fault whatsoever, and which, if known, would materially affect the Settling States' decision to enter into this Agreement or the Participating Subdivisions' decision to participate in this Agreement. E. Assigned Interest Waiver . To the extent t hat any Settling State has any direct or indirect interest in any rights of a third -party that is a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code as a result of a claim arising out of Covered Conduct by way of assignment or otherwise, including as a result of being the beneficiary of a trust or other distribution entity, to assert claims against a Settling Distributor (whether derivatively or otherwise), under any legal or equitable theory, including for indemnification, contribution, or subrogation, such Settling State waives the right to assert any such claim, or to receive a distribution or any benefit on account of such claim and such claim, distribution, or benefit shall be deemed assigned to such Settling Distributor. F. Res Judicata . Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to reduce the scope of the res judicata or claim preclusive effect that the settlement memorialized in this Agreement, and/or any Consent Judgment or other judgment entered on this Agreement, gives rise to under applicable law. G. Representation and Warranty . The signatories hereto on behalf of their respective Settling States expressly represent and warrant that they have (or have obtained, or will obtain no later than the Initial Participation Date) the authority to settle and release, to the ma ximum extent of the State's power, all Released Claims of (1) their respective Settling States, (2) all past and present executive departments, state agencies, divisions, boards, commissions and instrumentalities with the regulatory authority to enforce st ate and federal controlled substances acts, and (3) any of their respective Settling State's past and present executive departments, FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 49 agencies, divisions, boards, commissions and instrumentalities that have the authority to bring Claims related to Covered C onduct seeking money (including abatement and/or remediation) or revocation of a pharmaceutical distribution license. For the purposes of clause (3) above, executive departments, agencies, divisions, boards, commissions, and instrumentalities are those that are under the executive authority or direct control of the State's Governor. Also for the purposes of clause (3) , a release from a State's Governor is sufficient to demonstrate that the appropriate releases have been obtained. H. Effectiveness . The relea ses set forth in this Agreement shall not be impacted in any way by any dispute that exists, has existed, or may later exist between or among the Releasors. Nor shall such releases be impacted in any way by any current or future law, regulation, ordinance , or court or agency order limiting, seizing, or controlling the distribution or use of the Settlement Fund or any portion thereof, or by the enactment of future laws, or by any seizure of the Settlement Fund or any portion thereof. I. Cooperation . Releasors (1) will not encourage any person or entity to bring or maintain any Released Claim against any Released Entity and (2) will reasonably cooperate with and not oppose any effort by Settling Distributors to secure the prompt dismissal of any and all Release d Claims. J. Non-Released Claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in the definition of Released Claims, this Agreement does not waive, release or limit any criminal liability, Claims for liability under tax law, Claims under securities law by a Sta te Releasor as investor, Claims against parties who are not Released Entities, Claims by private individuals, and any claims arising under this Agreement for enforcement of this Agreement . XII. Later Litigating Subdivisions A. Released Claims against Released En tities. Subject to Section XII.B , the following shall apply in the event a Later Litigating Subdivision in a Settling State maintains a lawsuit for a Released Claim against a Released Entity after the Reference Date: 1. The Releas ed Entity shall take ordinary and reasonable measures to defend the action, including filing a Threshold Motion with respect to the Released Claim. The Released Entity shall further notify the Settling State and Settlement Fund Administrator immediately u pon notice of a Later Litigating Subdivision bringing a lawsuit for a Released Claim, and shall not oppose a Settling State's submission in support of the Threshold Motion. 2. The provisions of this Section XII.A.2 apply if the Later Litigating Subdivision is a Primary Subdivision (except as provided in Section XII.A.2.f ): a. If a lawsuit including a Released Claim survives until the Suspension Deadline for that lawsuit, the Settlement Fund A dministrator shall calculate the Suspension Amount applicable to the next Payment due from the Settling Distributor(s) at issue and apportioned to the State of the Later Litigating Subdivision and to Subdivisions in that State; provided , however , that the Suspension Amount for a Payment Year cannot exceed the Suspension Cap. The FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 50 Suspension Amount shall be paid into the Settlement Fund Escrow account. If the Suspension Amount exceeds the Suspension Cap for that Payment Year, then the remaining amount will be paid into the Settlement Fund Escrow in the following Payment Year, subject to the Suspension Cap for that Payment Year, and so forth in each succeeding Payment Year until the entire Suspension Amount has been paid into the Settlement Fund Escrow or the Released Claim is resolved, as provided below, whichever comes first . A suspension does not apply during the pendency of any appeal dismissing the lawsuit for a Released Claim in whole. b. If the Released Claim is resolved with finality without requirement of payment by the Released Entity, the placement of any remaining balance of the Suspension Amount into the Settlement Fund Escrow shall cease and the Settlement Fund Administrator shall immediately transfer amounts in the Settlement Fund Escrow on account of the suspension to the Settling State at issue and its Participating Subdivisions. The lawsuit will not cause further suspensions unless the Released Claim is reinstated upon further review, legislative action, or otherwise. c. If the Released Claim is re solved with finality on terms requiring payment by the Released Entity, the Settlement Fund Administrator will transfer the amounts in the Settlement Fund Escrow on account of the suspension to the Settling Distributor(s) at issue necessary to satisfy the payment obligation of the Released Entity to the relevant Later Litigating Subdivision. If any balance remains in the Settlement Fund Escrow on account of the suspension after transfer of the amount necessary to satisfy the payment obligation, the Settlem ent Fund Administrator will immediately transfer the balance to the Settling State at issue and its Participating Subdivisions. If the payment obligation of the Released Entity to the relevant Later Litigating Subdivision exceeds the amounts in the Settle ment Fund Escrow on account of the suspension, the Settling Distributor at issue shall receive a dollar -for-dollar offset, subject to the yearly Offset Cap, for the excess amount against its obligation to pay its allocable share of Annual Payments that wou ld be apportioned to the Settling State at issue and to its Subdivisions. The offset shall be applied as follows: first against the Settling Distributor's allocable share of the Annual Payment due in Payment Year 18, up to the Offset Cap for that Payment Year, with any remaining amounts above the Offset Cap applied against the Settling Distributor's allocable share of the Annual Payment due in Payment Year 17, up to the Offset Cap for that Payment Year, and so forth for each preceding Payment Year until t he entire amount to be offset has been applied or no future Payment Years remain. d. If the lawsuit asserting a Released Claim is resolved with finality on terms requiring payment by the Released Entity, and the Released Claim did not give rise to a suspensio n of any Settling Distributor's portion of any Annual Payments ( e.g., because it was resolved during Payment Years 1 or 2, during which all Settling States are deemed eligible for Incentive Payment A and thus no suspension of payments took place, as provid ed by Section XII.B ), the Settling Distributor at issue shall receive a dollar -for-dollar offset, subject to the yearly FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 51 Offset Cap, for the amount paid. The offset shall be applied against the relevant Settling Distributor's allocable portion of the Annual Payments starting in Payment Year 18 and working backwards as set forth in Section XII.A.2.c . If the lawsuit for a Released Claim is otherwise resolved by the Releas ed Entity, without the Settling Distributor filing a Threshold Motion despite an opportunity to do so, and the Released Claim did not give rise to a suspension of any Settling Distributor's portion of any Annual Payments, the Settling Distributor at issue shall not receive any offset for the amount paid. e. If more than one Primary Subdivision in a Settling State becomes a Later Litigating Subdivision, a single Suspension Cap applies and the total amounts deducted from the share of the Annual Payment allocated to the Settling State and its Participating Subdivisions in a given Payment Year cannot exceed the Suspension Cap. For the avoidance of doubt, an individual Primary Subdivision shall not trigger more than one suspension regardless if it (or any of its of ficials) is named as multiple plaintiffs in the same lawsuit. f. This Section XII.A.2 shall not apply with respect to a Primary Subdivision that is either (i) a Later Litigating Subdivision under clause (3) of the definition of that term solely because a legislative Bar or legislative Case -Specific Resolution applicable as of the Reference Date is invalidated by judicial decision after the Reference Date or (ii) a Later Litigating Subdivision under clause (4) of the definition of that term. Such a Primary Subdivision shall be treated as a General Purpose Government under Section XII.A.3 . 3. The terms of this Section XII.A.3 apply if a the Later Litigating Subdivision is not a Primary Subdivision (except for Primary Subdivisions referenced in Section XII.A.2.f ) but is a General Purpose Government, School District, Health District or Hospital District: if the Released Claim is resolved with finality on terms requiring payment by the Released Entity, the Settling Distributor at issue shall receive a dollar - for-dollar offset, subject to the yearly Offset Cap, for the amount paid against its port ion of the obligation to make Annual Payments that would be apportioned to the Settling State at issue and to its Subdivisions. The offset shall be applied as follows: first against the relevant Settling Distributor's allocable share of the Annual Paymen t due in Payment Year 18, up to the Offset Cap for that Payment Year, with any remaining amounts above the Offset Cap applied against the Payment due in Payment Year 17, up to the Offset Cap for that Payment Year, and so forth for each preceding Payment Ye ar until the entire amount to be offset has been applied or no future Payment Year remains. If the Released Claim is resolved on terms requiring payment during the first two (2) Payment Years, in no case will any amounts be offset against the amounts due in Payment Years 1 and 2. 4. In no event shall the total of Suspension Amounts and offsets pursuant to this Section applicable to a Settling State in a Payment Year for that Payment Year exceed the Offset Cap for that State. If, in a Payment Year, the total of Suspension Amounts and offsets applicable to a Settling State exceeds the Offset Cap, the Suspension Amounts shall be reduced so that the total of Suspension Amounts and offsets equals the Offset Cap. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 52 5. For the avoidance of doubt, any offset pursuant to t his Section XII in a Settling State that is not eligible for Incentive Payment A shall continue to apply even if the Settling State at issue subsequently becomes eligible for Incentive Payment A. 6. \"Terms requiring payment \" shall mean (i) a final monetary judgment or (ii) a settlement; provided that the Released Entity sought the applicable State Attorney General's consent to the settlement and such consent was either obtained or unreasonably withheld. Should the j udgment or settlement resolve claims that are not Released Claims, the offset shall be for the Released Claims portion only, which shall be distinguishable in the judgment or settlement. B. Exceptions. 1. Section XII.A shall not apply where the Settling State at issue meets the eligibility criteria for and is entitled to Incentive Payment A for the Payment Year at issue, except as expressly provided therein. For the avoidance of doubt, because all Settling States are d eemed eligible for Incentive Payment A for Payment Years 1 and 2 under Section IV.F.1.c , a suspension of Payments under Section XII.A.2 shall not apply to any Settling States for those Payment Years. 2. An offset under Section XII.A.2 and Section XII.A.3 shall not apply where the Later Litigating Subdivision opted out of a Settlement Class Resolution in the Settling State at issue that was in full force and effect in that Settling State as of the due date of the payment for Payment Year 2 and remains in full force and effect; provided that an offset relating to that Subdivision may apply under Section XIII. 3. Section XII.A shall not apply where the Later Litigating Subdivision seeks less than $10 million, or so long as its total claim is reduced to less than $10 millio n, in the lawsuit for a Released Claim at issue. 4. An offset under Section XII.A.3 shall not apply where the applicable Participation Tier is Participation Tier 1 and the population of the Later Litigating Subdiv ision is under 10,000. 5. If the applicable Participation Tier is Participation Tier 2 or higher, and the Later Litigating Subdivision has a population less than 10,000, the offset under Section XII.A.3 shall only apply to amounts paid pursuant to a settlement or judgment that are over $10 million per case or resolution. Any type of consolidated or aggregated or joined or class actions, however styled, shall be consider ed a single case, and any resolutions that occur within a sixty (60) calendar day period of each other and involve Later Litigating Subdivisions that share common counsel and/or are created by the same or related judgments, settlement agreements, or other instruments or are conditioned upon one another, shall be considered a single resolution. For the avoidance of doubt, any such case or resolution shall have only a single $10,000,000 exemption from the offset under Section XII.A.3 . C. No Effect on Other Provisions . A suspension or offset under Section XII.A shall not affect the Injunctive Relief Terms or the Consent Judgment. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 53 D. No Effect on Other States . A suspension or offset under Section XII.A applicable to one State shall not affect the allocation or payment of the Annual Payment to other Settling States. XIII. Reductions/Offsets A. Non-Settling States. Non-Settling States shall not be eligible for any payments or have any rights in connection with this Agreement. Accordingly, the stated maximum dollar amounts of the payments specified in Exhibit M are reduced by the aggregate Overall Allocation Percentage of Non -Settling States as set forth in Exhibit F . B. Offset Relating to Incentive Payment A. If a Settling State is not eligible for Incentive Payment A at the third Payment Date, the Settling Distributo rs shall receive an offset with respect to that State.10 The offset shall be the dollar amount difference between (1) the total amount of the Incentive Payment A due from the Settling Distributors on the Effective Date and on the Payment Date for Payment Y ear 2 allocated to that State and its Participating Subdivisions, and (2) the total amount of Incentive Payments B and C that would have been due from the Settling Distributors on the Effective Date and on the Payment Date for Payment Year 2 so allocated b ut for the State's deemed eligibility for Incentive Payment A. The offset shall be applied in equal installments to reduce the Annual Payments for Payment Years 3 through 7 that would be apportioned to that State and to its Subdivisions, and shall remain applicable even if that State subsequently becomes eligible for Incentive Payment A. C. Settlement Class Resolution Opt Outs. If a Settling State is eligible for Incentive Payment A on the basis of a Settlement Class Resolution, and a Primary Subdivision tha t opted out of the Settlement Class Resolution maintains a lawsuit asserting a Released Claim against a Released Entity, the following shall apply. If the lawsuit asserting a Released Claim either survives a Threshold Motion or has an unresolved Threshold Motion fewer than sixty (60) calendar days prior to the scheduled start of a trial involving a Released Claim, and is resolved with finality on terms requiring payment by the Released Entity, the Settling Distributor at issue shall receive a dollar -for-dollar offset for the amount paid against its obligation to make remaining Incentive Payment A payments that would be apportioned to that State and to its Subdivisions. For the avoidance of doubt, an offset shall not be applicable under this subsection if it is applicable under Section XII.A with respect to the Subdivision at issue. D. Revoked Bar, Settlement Class Resolution, or Case -Specific Resolution. If the Settling Distributors made any Annual Payments that inc luded any incentive payments earned as a result of the existence of a Bar, Settlement Class Resolution, or Case -Specific Resolution in a Settling State, and there is subsequently a Revocation Event with respect to that Bar, Settlement Class Resolution, or Case -Specific Resolution after the determination of the amount of such Annual Payment, the Settling Distributors shall receive a dollar -for-dollar offset against the portion of remaining Annual Payments that would be allocated to that State and its Partici pating Subdivisions. This offset will be calculated as the dollar amount difference between (1) the total amount of incentive payments paid by the Settling Distributors by virtue of the Bar, Settlement 10 For purposes of this provision, in determining whether a Settling State would not be eligible for Incentive Payme nt A for Payment Year 3, the criteria set forth in Section IV.F.1.b shall apply to that Payment Year. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 54 Class Resolution, or Case -Specific Resolution subject to the Revocation Event and (2) the total amount of incentive payments that would have been due from the Settling Distributors during that time had the Bar, Settlement Class Resolution, or Case -Specific Resolution subject to the Revocation Event not been in effect. The amount of incentive payments that would have been due, referenced in clause (2) above, will be calculated one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after the Revocation Event; for purposes of calculating the amount of incentive payments that would have been due, any relevant Subdivision shall be included as a Participating Subdivision if: (1) its Released Claims are extinguished by any subsequent Bar, Settlement Class Resolution, or Case -Specific Resolution in effect as of the date of such cal culation, or (2) it becomes a Participating Subdivision (in addition to all other Participating Subdivisions) prior to the date of such calculation. E. Certain Taxes. Amounts paid by a Settling Distributor under an Opioid Tax in a Settling State in a Payment Year shall give rise to a dollar -for-dollar offset against that Settling Distributor's obligation to pay its share of the Annual Payment in that Payment Year that would be allocated to the taxing State or its Participating Subdivisions. If such amounts p aid exceed that Settling Distributor's allocable share of the Annual Payment allocable to the taxing State or its Participating Subdivisions in that Payment Year, the excess shall carry forward as an offset against its allocable share of remaining Annual P ayments that would be allocated to the taxing State or its Participating Subdivisions F. Not Subject to Suspension Cap or Offset Cap. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Suspension Cap nor the Offset Cap apply to the offsets and reductions set forth in this Section XIII. XIV. Miscellaneous A. Population of General Purpose Governments. The population figures for General Purpose Governments shall be the published U.S. Census Bureau's population estimates for July 1, 2019, released May 2020. These population figures shall remain unchanged during the term of this Agreement.11 B. Population of Special Districts . For any purpose in this Agreement in which the population of a Special District is used other than Section IV.F.1.b : (a) School Districts' population will be measured by the number of students enrolled who are eligible under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\" IDEA \") or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; (b) Health Districts' and Hospital Districts' population will be measured at twenty -five percent (25%) of discharges; and (c) all other Special Districts' (including Fire Districts' and Library Districts') population will be measured at ten percent (10%) of the population served. The Settling Distributors and the Enforcement Committee shall meet and confer in order to agree on data sources for purposes of this Section prior to the Preliminary Agreement Date. 11 The estimates for counties and parishes were accessed at https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time - series/de mo/popest/2010s -countiestotal.html. The estimates for cities and towns can currently be found at https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time -series/demo/popest/2010s -total-cities -and-towns.html . FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 55 C. Population Associated with Sheriffs . For any purpose in this Agreement i n which the population associated with a lawsuit by a sheriff is used, the population will be measured at twenty percent (20%) of the capacity of the jail(s) operated by the sheriff. D. No Admission. The Settling Distributors do not admit liability or wrongd oing. Neither this Agreement nor the Consent Judgments shall be considered, construed or represented to be (1) an admission, concession or evidence of liability or wrongdoing or (2) a waiver or any limitation of any defense otherwise available to the Sett ling Distributors. E. Most -Favored -Nation Provision .\u2014Settling States. 1. If, after the Reference Date, any Settling Distributor enters into any settlement agreement with any Non -Settling State that resolves Claims similar in scope to the Claims released by a Set tling State under this Agreement on overall payment terms that are more favorable to such Non -Settling State than the overall payment terms of the Agreement (after due consideration of relevant differences in population or other appropriate factors), then the Settling States, individually or collectively, may elect to seek review, pursuant to Section XIV.E.3 , of the overall payment terms of this Agreement and the Non -Settling State agreement so that such Settling State(s) may obtain, with respect to that Settling Distributor, overall payment terms at least as favorable as those obtained by such Non -Settling State. \" Overall payment terms \" refers to consideration of all payment terms of the two agreements, taken tog ether, including, but not limited to the amount of payments, the timing of payments, and conditions or contingencies on payments. 2. For any settlement with a Non -Settling State involving Released Claims that is entered into after the Reference Date, Settling Distributors shall provide the Enforcement Committee with a copy of the settlement agreement or relevant consent judgment within thirty (30) calendar days of the consummation of such settlement. The Enforcement Committee will promptly distribute such cop y to all Settling States. 3. In the event that one or more Settling State(s) believes that the overall payment terms of an agreement by a Settling Distributor with a Non -Settling State are more favorable to the Non -Settling State, when compared based on th e totality of the considerations set forth in Section XIV.E.1 , the Settling State(s) and the Settling Distributor shall engage in the following process: a. The Settling State(s) shall provide notice, within sixty (6 0) calendar days of the date on which a settlement agreement or consent judgment is provided to the Enforcement Committee, to the Settling Distributor of its (their) intent to seek revision of this Agreement to provide payment terms that are, on an overall basis, as favorable as those obtained by the Non -Settling State. Such notice shall be confidential and not disclosed publicly to the extent allowed by law and shall state, in detail, the basis for the State's (States') belief that it (they) is entitled t o a revision of the Agreement. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 56 b. The Settling Distributor shall, within thirty (30) calendar days, provide a response to the Settling State(s), explaining its position, in detail, as to whether the Settling State(s) is entitled to more favorable overall paym ent terms than those provided for in this Agreement. c. In the event the Settling State(s) and Settling Distributor do not reach agreement as to the application of Section XIV.E.1 , the Settling State(s) may petitio n the National Arbitration Panel to seek a ruling from the Panel as to the applicability of Section XIV.E.1 , provided that the Settling State(s) may seek such review only if at least five (5) Settling States co -sign the petition. The Panel shall consider submissions and argument by the parties pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section VI.F.2 . d. The Settling State(s) and the Settling Distributor shall be bound by the determination of the National Arbitration P anel. 4. This Section XIV.E does not apply to, and there is no ability of any Settling State to seek or obtain revision of this Agreement based on, any Non -Settling State agreement with any Settling Distributor tha t is entered into with: (a) a Non -Settling State after a date sixty (60) calendar days prior to the scheduled start date of a trial between any Settling Distributor and the Non -Settling State or any severed or bifurcated portion thereof, provided that, wh ere, in order to complete a settlement, a Non -Settling State and a Settling Distributor jointly request an adjournment of the scheduled start date of a trial within sixty ( 60) days of that date , this exception will apply as if the trial date had not been ad journed ; (b) a Non -Settling State that previously litigated to judgment a case related to opioids against any manuf acturer, distributor, or pharmacy; or (c) a Non - Settling State that has obtained any court order or judicial determination that grants judgme nt (in whole or in part) against any Settling Distributor. For avoidance of doubt, the National Arbitration Panel shall have no power to review agreements described in this paragraph. 5. This Section XIV.E does not apply to, and there is no ability of any Settling State to seek or obtain revision of this Agreement based on, any agreement between a Settling Distributor and (a) federally -recognized tribe(s) or (b) West Virginia subdivisions or (c) Non -Participating Su bdivisions. This Section XIV.E will not apply to any agreement entered into more than eighteen (18) months after the Reference Date. F. Tax Cooperation and Reporting . 1. Upon request by any Settling Distributor, the S ettling States and Participating Subdivisions agree to perform such further acts and to execute and deliver such further documents as may be reasonably necessary for the Settling Distributors to establish the statements set forth in Section V.F to the satisfaction of their tax advisors, their independent financial auditors, the Internal Revenue Service, or any other governmental authority, including as contemplated by Treasury Regulations Section 1.162 -21(b)(3)(ii) and any subseq uently proposed or finalized relevant regulations or administrative guidance. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 57 2. Without limiting the generality of Section XIV.F.1 , each Settling State and Participating Subdivision shall cooperate in good faith with any Settling Distributor with respect to any tax claim, dispute, investigation, audit, examination, contest, litigation, or other proceeding relating to this Agreement. 3. The Designated State, as defined in Section I.P as New Y ork, on behalf of all Settling States and Participating Subdivisions, shall designate one of its officers or employees to act as the \"appropriate official\" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6050X -1(f)(1)(ii)(B) (the \" Appropriate Official \"). The Designated State shall direct and ensure that the Appropriate Official timely (a) files (i) at the time this Agreement becomes binding on the Parties, an IRS Form 1098 -F in the form attached as Exhibit U , Exhibit V , and Exhibit W with respect to each of the Settling Distributors and (ii) any legally required returns or amended returns with an y applicable governmental authority, or any returns requested by the respective Settling Distributors, and (b) provides to each of the Settling Distributors a copy of (i) the IRS Form 1098 -F filed with respect to such Settling Distributor and (ii) any lega lly required written statement pursuant to any applicable law and any other document referred to in clause (a)(ii) above. Any such form, return, or statement shall be prepared and filed in a manner fully consistent with Section V.F. 4. The Settling States and Participating Subdivisions agree that any return, amended return, or written statement filed or provided pursuant to paragraph 3, and any similar document, shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with reporting each Settling Distributor's portion of the Global Settlement Amount as the \"Total amount to be paid\" pursuant to this Agreement in Box 1 of IRS Form 1098 -F and each Settling Distributor's portion of the Compensatory Restitution Amount as \"Restitution/remediati on amount\" in Box 2 of IRS Form 1098 -F, as reflected in the attached Exhibit U , Exhibit V , and Exhibit W . If the Designated State or Appropriate Official shall be required to file any return, amended return, or written statement contemplated by this Section XIV.F other than an IRS Form 1098 -F in the form at tached as Exhibit U , Exhibit V , and Exhibit W , the Designated State shall direct and ensure that the Appropriate Official provides to each Settling Distributor a draft of such return, amended return, or written statement in respect of such Settling Distributor no later than sixty (60) calendar days prior to the due date thereof and shall accept and re flect any reasonable comments of such Settling Distributor on the return, amended return, or written statement in respect of such Settling Distributor. 5. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Settling Distributors nor the Settling States and Participating Subdivisions make any warranty or representation to any Settling State, Participating Subdivision, or Releasor as to the tax consequences of the payment of the Compensatory Restitution Amount (or any portion thereof). G. No Third -Party Beneficiaries. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, no portion of this Agreement shall provide any rights to, or be enforceable by, any person or entity that is not a Settling State or Released Entity.

By default, the Subdivisions set forth on this Exhibit G shall include: (1) all Litigating Subdivisions that are General Purpose Governmen ts; (2) all counties and parishes in States with functional counties or parishes; (3) all Subdivisions that are the highest level of General Purpose Government in States without functional counties or parishes; and (4) all other Subdivisions that are Gener al Purpose Governments with a population of 10,000 or greater. A State may elect to add any additional Subdivisions to this Exhibit G at any time prior to the Initial Participation Date. Immediately upon the e ffectiveness of any State -Subdivision Agreement, Allocation Statute, Statutory Trust , or voluntary redistribution allowed by Section V.D.3 (or upon the effectiveness of an amendment to any State -Subdivision Ag reement, Allocation Statute, Statutory Trust , or voluntary redistribution allowed by Section V.D.3 ) that addresses allocation from the Subdivision Fund, whether before or after the Initial Participation Date, this Exhibit G will automatically be amended to reflect the allocation from th e Subdivision Fund pursuant to the State -Subdivision Ag reement, Allocation Statute, Statutory Trust , or voluntary redistribution allowed by Section V.D.3 . For the avoidance of doubt, inclusion on this Exhibit G shall not create any claim for any amount of the Settlement Fund, and no such amounts shall be allocated or distributed to any Subdivision included herein if such Subdivision does not otherwise meet all requirements to receive any such funds pursuant to this Agreement. The Parties recognize the benefits of remediation funds reaching all communities, including through direct payments from the Subd ivision Fund. However, to promote efficiency in the use of such funds and avoid administratively -burdensome disbursements that would be too small to add a meaningful abatement response, certain Subdivisions do not receive a direct allocation from the Subdi vision Fund. However, such Subdivisions will benefit from Opioid Remediation in their community, and are eligible to receive direct benefits from the Abatement Accounts Fund in their State. All settlement funds, whether allocated to a Settling State, an Abatement Accounts Fund or a Subdivision listed on this Exhibit G can be used for Opioid Remediation in communities not listed herein. As provided by Section V.D.4.c , the Allocation Percentages shown below apply to distribution of each Settling State's Subdivision Fund in the absence of a State -Subdivision Agreement, Allocation Statute, or Statutory Trust. The allocation that would have otherwise gone to General Purpo se Government Subdivisions not listed below as receiving a direct allocation shall be (1) directed to the county or parish in which such Subdivision is located in Settling States with functional counties or parishes if the relevant county or parish is a Pa rticipating Subdivision or (2) to the highest -level General Purpose Government in which such Subdivision is located in Settling States without functional counties or parishes if the relevant highest -level General FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 G-2 Purpose Government is a Participating Subdi vision. Where the relevant county, parish or highest -level General Purpose Government is not a Participating Subdivision, allocations of General Purpose Subdivisions not listed below as eligible to become Participating Subdivisions shall be allocated purs uant to Section VII.I . The redirecting of funds described in this paragraph is intended to promote the efficient use of Opioid Remediation funds while keeping, where possible, local control of the distribution o f those funds.

For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the definition of \"State\" in Section I.TTT or Exhibit F , neither Washington, D.C., nor any territory of the United States will be included for purposes of determining the participation tier under this Exhibit H . 4 School Districts, Health Districts, Hospital Districts, Library Districts and Fire Districts that satisfy the definition of Litigating Subdivision will be included for purposes of determining the Percentage of Litigating Subdivisions. These categories of Special District shall have their population measured as set forth in Section XIV.B . Any other Special Districts that satisfy the definition of Litigating Subdivisions will not be included f or purposes of calculating the Participation Tier. The Percentage of Litigating Subdivisions and Percentage of Non -Litigating Primary Subdivisions will be calculated as follows: each Litigating Subdivision and each Non -Litigating Subdivision in the 49 states used to calculate the Participation Tier will be assigned a metric reflecting both population and severity (the \"Population -Severity Metric\"). The Population - Severity Metric shall be the Subdivision's population plus the Subdivision's population m ultiplied by the severity factor for the State of the Subdivision (the severity factors for each State are attached as Exhibit X hereto) and then divided in two, thus giving fifty percent (50%) weight to each of population and population multiplied by the severity factor. The denominator for each Percentage shall be the sum total of the Population -Severity Metric for all the Subdivisions in the relevant category (Litigating Subdivisions or Non -Litigating Primary Subdivisions) in the Settling States, notwithstanding that persons may be included within the population (and therefore the Population -Severity Metric) of more than one Subdivision. The numerator will be the sum total of the Population -Severity Metrics of all Subdivisions in the relevant category of Subdivision ( i.e., Litigating Subdivisions or Non -Litigating Subdivisions that are also Primary Subdivisions) in the Settling States that are either Participating Subdivisions or are subject to a Bar, Case -Spec ific Resolution, or Settlement Class Resolution, notwithstanding that persons may be included within the population of more than one Subdivision. An FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 H-2 individual Litigating Subdivision shall not be included more than once in the numerator, and shall not be included more than once in the denominator, of the calculation regardless if it (or any of its officials) is named as multiple plaintiffs in the same lawsuit; provided , however , that for the avoidance of doubt, no Litigating Subdivision will be excluded fr om the numerator or denominator under this sentence unless a Litigating Subdivision otherwise counted in the denominator has the authority to release the Claims (consistent with Section XI) of the Litigating Subd ivision to be excluded. For the avoidance of doubt, Subdivisions in Non -Settling States are excluded from both the denominator and numerator of the calculations for the Percentage of Litigating Subdivisions and Percentage of Non -Litigating Primary Su bdivisions. 5 During the period when the Participation Tier is redetermined annually, Later Participating Subdivisions described in Section VII.E.3 or Section VII.E.4 shall not be included as Participating Subdivisions, and for Subdivisions subject to a Bar, Case -Specific Resolution, or Settlement Class Resolution to be included, the Bar, Case -Specific Resolution, or Settlement Class Resolution must have been in effect both as of the relevant Payment Date and for the entire period since the prior Payment Date.

The duties of the Settlement Fund Administrator under the Distributor Settlement Agreement will be divided between Directed Trustee and Directing Administrator. ii. The Directed Trustee and Directing Administrator will each be selected through a targeted solicitation process. Criteria for selection will include, but not be limited to, institutional strength; potential institutional conflicts; experience with work of simi lar size and complexity; capacity to handle the scope of work; staffing and other proposed resources; and cost and pricing proposals. The selection process will include written submissions and interviews. iii. Within sixty (60) calendar days of the selection of the Settlement Fund Administrators, unless such time is extended by written agreement of the Settling Distributors and the Enforcement Committee , contracts shall be negotiated and finalized with the Directed Trustee and Directing Administrator. iv.

All parties to the Distributor Settlement Agreement are entitled to rely upon information received from the Settlement Fund Administrators, whether in oral, written, or other form. No Party to the Distributor Settlement Agreement shall have any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract or tort or otherwise) to any party for or in connection with any action taken or not taken by the Settlement Fund Administrators. In addition, no Party to the Distributor Settlement Agreement shall have any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract or tort or otherwise) t o any party for or in connection with any action taken or not taken by a Settling Distributor based on incorrect, inaccurate, incomplete or otherwise erroneous information or data provided by the Settlement Fund Administrators. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this paragraph alters Sections I to XIV of the Distributor Settlement Agreement or any of the exhibits therein. C.

The Directing Administrator is responsible for receiving and preserving the Subdivision Settlement Participation Forms pursuant to Section VII.B of the Distributor Settlement Agreement. The Directing Administrator is responsible for ensuring new ly received forms are properly executed. For forms executed and accepted prior to the retention of the Directing Administrator, the Directing Administrator shall rely on information provided by Rubris as to the proper execution of the forms unless it is pr ovided information that indicates such information is incorrect. ii. Within sixty (60) calendar days of its retention , the Directing Administrator shall establish a process to receive, preserve, and review the Subdivision Settlement Participation Forms. The Directing Administrator is encouraged, in the interests of efficiency and so long as financially reasonable, to continue to utilize Rubris and the processes previously implemented by the Settling Distributors and Enforcement Committee to fulfill its obliga tions under this Section III.A. The Directing Administrator may rely on the information provided by Rubris unless it is provided information that indicates such information is incorrect. iii. After the Reference Date, the Directing Administrator will make the Subdivision Settlement Participation Forms available to the Settling Distributors, the Enforcement Committee, and the Settling States through Rubris, or another online platform.

FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 L-4 v. The Directing Administrator shall provide quarterly reports pursuant to S ection VII.C of the Distributor Settlement Agreement for Settling States that require information regarding contingency fee contracts on their Subdivision Settlement Participation Form. Upon reasonable request, the Directing Administrator shall also provi de reasonably available information to Settling States and Participating Subdivisions relevant to calculating amounts owed under a State Back -Stop Agreement. B. Determination of the Participation Tier . i. The Directing Administrator shall determine the Particip ation Tier existing on July 1, 2022 applying the criteria set forth in Exhibit H of the Distributor Settlement Agreement. The Directing Administrator shall notify the Settling Distributors and the Enforcement Committee of the Participation Tier within five (5) calendar days of its determination. 1. If the Settling Distributors and the Enforcement Committee agree as to the Participation Tier, they shall so inform the Directing Administrator, and such agreement shall satisfy the Directing Administrator's obligations under this Section III.B.i. ii. The Directing Administrator shall redetermine the Participation Tier annually as of the Payment Date, beginning with Payment Year 3, pursuant to the criteria set forth in Exhibit H of the Distributor Settlement Agreemen t. 1. In the event that a Participation Tier redetermination moves the Participation Tier higher, and that change is in whole or in part as a result of the post -Reference Date enactment of a Bar and there is later a Revocation Event with respect to such Bar , then on the next Payment Date that is at least one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after the Revocation Event, the Directing Administrator shall move the Participation Tier down to the Participation Tier that would have applied had the Bar never been enacted, unless the Bar is reinstated or all Subdivisions affected by the Revocation Event become Participating Subdivisions within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days of the Revocation Event. This is the sole circumstance in which, on a nationwide bas is, the Participation Tier can move down. 2. In the event that there is a post -Reference Date Revocation Event with respect to a Bar that was enacted in a Settling State prior to the Reference Date, then, on the next Payment Date that is at least one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after the Revocation Event, unless the Bar is reinstated or all Subdivisions affected by the Revocation Event become Participating Subdivisions within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days of the Revocation Event, the Directing Administrator shall decrease the Participation Tier - solely for the State in which the Revocation Event occurred - to the Participation Tier commensurate with the percentage of Litigating Subdivisions in that State that are Participating Subdivisions and the percentage of Non -Litigating Subdivisions that are both Primary Subdivisions and Participating Subdivisions, according to the criteria set forth in Exhibit H of the Distributor Settlement Agreement, except that the calculations shall be performed as to that State alone. For the avoidance of doubt and solely for the calculation in this subparagraph, the Settling States Column of Exhibit H of the Distributor Settlement FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 L-5 Agreement shall play no role. This is the sole circumstance in which one Settling Sta te will have a different Participation Tier than other Settling States. 3. The redetermination of the Participation Tier shall not affect payments already made or suspensions, offsets, or reductions already applied. 4. After each redetermination, the Directing A dministrator shall notify the Settling Distributors and the Enforcement Committee of the Participation Tier within five (5) calendar days of its determination. 5. If the Settling Distributors and the Enforcement Committee agree as to a Participation Tier rede termination, they shall so inform the Directing Administrator and such agreement shall satisfy the Directing Administrator's obligations under this Section III.B.ii. iii. After Payment Year 6, the Participation Tier cannot move higher, unless this restriction is waived by the Settling Distributors. If this restriction is waived by the Settling Distributors, the Directing Administrator shall be responsible for calculating the Participation Tier consistent with the instructions in Section III.B.ii. iv. Any disputes as to the determination of the Participation Tier shall be decided by the National Arbitration Panel pursuant Section VI.F.2 to the Distributor Settlement Agreement. IV. Calculation and Allocation of Annual Payments A. General Principles. i. This Section IV is i ntended to implement the relevant provisions of Sections I through XIV of the Distributor Settlement Agreement and the exhibits therein. To the extent this Section IV conflicts with Sections I through XIV of the Distributor Settlement Agreement and the ex hibits therein, the Distributor Settlement Agreement shall control. ii. The Settlement Fund Administrators are entitled to rely upon information received from the Parties to the Distributor Settlement Agreement, whether in oral, written, or other form, for the purpose for which it was submitted, provided that such information is not disputed by another Party. iii. The Settling Distributors and the Enforcement Committee may agree to some or all of the calculations and allocations set forth in this Section IV pri or to the Directing Administrator making such determination. In such cases, they shall so inform the Directing Administrator and such agreement shall satisfy the Directing Administrator's obligations to determine such calculations and allocations unless t he Directing Administrator is provided with information establishing that the agreed -upon calculation or allocation is inaccurate. iv. The Settling States have different requirements for how payments are made to the State and its Participating Subdivisions lis ted in Exhibit G based on applicable State -Subdivision Agreements, Allocation Statutes, Statutory Trusts, State Back - Stop Agreements, fiscal laws, and other differences. The Directing Administrator shall ask the Attorney General's Office in each Settling State to: (a) inform it whether the State has a State -Subdivision Agreement, Allocation FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 L-6 Statute, and/or Statutory Trust; and (b) submit instructions on how payments are to be made to the State and its Participating Subdivisions listed on Exhibit G of the D istributor Settlement Agreement. The Directing Administrator shall comply with such instructions so long as it is timely submitted and permissible under Sections I through XIV of the Distributor Settlement Agreement and the exhibits therein. 1. Notwithstan ding the above, the Directing Administrator shall not instruct the Directed Trustee to make payments to any entity that is not an instrumentality of: (a) a Settling State; (b) a Participating Subdivision; (c) a trust account for an attorney representing a Settling State or Participating Subdivision; or (d) a special master or similar entity identified by a Settling State. 2. A Participating Subdivision listed on Exhibit G of the Distributor Settlement Agreement may timely choose to make a voluntary redistribut ion as provided by Section V.D.3 of the Distributor Settlement Agreement by providing notice through the instructions provided by the Attorney General's Office for its State or by providing notice directly to the Directing Administrator through the instruc tions provided by the Directing Administrator. v. The Directing Administrator shall request any Settling State without a State - Subdivision Agreement, Allocation Statute, or Statutory Trust , to submit a designation of a lead State agency or other entity to ser ve as the single point of contact for that Settling State's funding requests from the Abatement Accounts Fund to comply with Section V.D.4.b of the Distributor Settlement Agreement . The designated entity shall be the only entity authorized to request the Directing Administrator instruct the Directed Trustee to disburse from that Settling State's Abatement Accounts Fund. The Directing Administrator shall not instruct the Directed Trustee to disburse any moneys from these Settling States' Abatement Accounts Fund without such instructions. vi. In consultation with the Settling Distributors and the Enforcement Committee, the Directing Administrator may set reasonable limits on the frequency with which it directs the Directed Trustee to make payments and may set ot her reasonable restrictions on complying with requests made by Settling States or their Participating Subdivisions, to limit the burdens and costs imposed on the Settlement Fund Administrators. B. Payment Year 1 Annual Payment. i. The Settlement Fund Administra tors shall be responsible for allocating the Annual Payment for Payment Year 1 among Settling States and Participating Subdivisions listed in Exhibit G of the Distributor Settlement Agreement. ii. The Settling Distributors have placed into the Settlement Fund Escrow the Annual Payment (the total amount of the base payment and Incentive Payment A due for the Settling States) for Payment Year 1. 1. This is the Restitution/Abatement amount specified in Exhibit M of the Distributor Settlement Agreement for Payment Y ear 1, reduced by the allocable share of Non -Settling States provided in Exhibit F of the Distributor Settlement Agreement. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 L-7 iii. In the event that, in accordance with the terms of Section VIII.A of the Distributor Settlement Agreement, the Settling Distributors determine not to proceed with the Distributor Settlement Agreement, or the Distributor Settlement Agreement does not become effective for any other reason, the Settlement Fund Escrow shall immediately revert to the Settling Distributors. iv. If the condition set forth in Section VIII.A of the Distributor Settlement Agreement is met, the Directing Administrator shall proceed as follows: 1. The Directing Administrator shall allocate the Annual Payment for Payment Year 1 among the Settling States and their Participa ting Subdivisions listed on Exhibit G of the Distributor Settlement Agreement. a. The Directing Administrator shall determine each Settling State's overall allocation using the allocation percentages in Exhibit F of the Distributor Settlement Agreement. b. The Directing Administrator shall determine the allocations within each Settling State pursuant to Section V.C, Section V.D and Exhibit G of the Distributor Settlement Agreement, taking into account the instructions it has received pursuant to Section IV.A.iv, above. c. If a Settling State and its Participating Subdivisions agree as to the intrastate allocation pursuant to Section V.C, Section V.D and Exhibit G of the Distributor Settlement Agreement, the Attorney General's Office in the Settling State shall so in form the Settlement Fund Administrators and such agreement shall satisfy the Directing Administrator's obligations under Section IV.B.iv.1.b, above, provided the Settling Distributors do not object. 2.

Such disput ing party must provide a written notice of dispute to the Settlement Fund Administrators, the Enforcement Committee, any affected Settling State, and the Settling Distributors identifying the nature of the dispute, the amount of money that is disputed, and the Settling State(s) affected. The Directing Administrator will maintain official contact information for providing a notice of dispute. ii. Within twenty -one (21) calendar days of the sending of a written notice of dispute, any affected party may submit a response, in writing, to the Settlement Fund Administrators, the Enforcement Committee, any affected Settling State, and the Settling Distributors identifying the basis for disagreement with the notice of dispute. iii. If no response is filed, and the Directing Administrator determines the disputing Party is correct, the Directing Administrator shall adjust the amount calculated consistent with the written notice of dispute and accordingly provide updated instructions to the Directed Trustee, and each Settling D istributor shall pay its allocable share of the adjusted amount, collectively totaling that year's Annual Payment, on the Payment Date. If a written response to the written notice of dispute is timely sent to the Settlement Fund Administrators, the Direct ing Administrator shall notify the Settling Distributors of the preliminary amount to be paid, which shall be the greater of the amount originally calculated by the Directing Administrator or the amount that would be consistent with the notice of dispute, provided, however, that in no circumstances shall the preliminary amount to be paid be higher than the maximum amount of base and Incentive Payments A and D for that Payment Year as set forth on Exhibit M of the Distributor Settlement Agreement.

The Directing Administrator shall instruct the Directed Trustee to place any disputed amount of the preliminary amount paid by the Settling Distributors into the Settlement Fund Escrow and to disburse any undisputed amount to each FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 L-14 Settling St ate and its Participating Subdivisions listed on Exhibit G of the Distributor Settlement Agreement within fifteen (15) calendar days of the Payment Date or at such later time as directed by each Settling State. v.

The de adlines in this Section IV may be extended by the written agreement of the Settling Distributors and the Enforcement Committee. V. Reporting Obligations A. Reporting of Non -Opioid Remediation Uses. i. The Directing Administrator shall set up a system to receive an d preserve reports from Settling States and Participating Subdivisions that have used monies from the Settlement Fund for purposes that do not qualify as Opioid Remediation, pursuant to Section V.B.2 of the Distributor Settlement Agreement.

(and corresponding or similar provisio ns of state, local, or foreign law, as applicable). The Settlement Fund Administrators or any independent certified public accounting firm selected by the Settling Distributors to serve as administrator of the Settlement Fund for tax purposes (the \"Tax Ad ministrator\") shall not take any action or tax position inconsistent with such treatment.

The Settling Distributors and Settlement Fund Administrators shall provide such cooperation and information as the Tax Administrator may reasonably request in performing the responsibilities set forth in this Section VI. iii. Any costs a nd fees arising from a Tax Administrator shall be allocated evenly among the Settling Distributors. For the avoidance of doubt, each Settling FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 L-16 Distributor's liability for its share of the costs and fees is several, and not joint. No Settling Distributor s hall be responsible for any portion of another Settling Distributor's share. For the years that Janssen is also utilizing the Settlement Fund , costs will be divided equ ally among the four companies.FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 M-1 EXHIBIT M Settlement Payment Schedule The below reflects the maximum payment if all States become Settling States and no offsets or reductions pursuant to this Agreement apply .

FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 P-10 D. For purposes of the Injunctive Relief Terms, \" Red Flags \" are defined as follows: 1. Ordering ratio of Highly Diverted Controlled Substances to non - Controlled Substances: Analyze the ratio of the order volume of all Highly Diverted Controlled Substances to the order volume of all non - Controlled Substances to identify Customers with significant rates of ordering H ighly Diverted Controlled Substances. 2. Ordering ratio of Highly Diverted Controlled Substance base codes or drug families to non -Controlled Substances: Analyze the ratio of the order volume of each Highly Diverted Controlled Substance base code or drug f amily to the total order volume of all non -Controlled Substances to identify Customers with significant rates of ordering each Highly Diverted Controlled Substance base code or drug family. 3. Excessive ordering growth of Controlled Substances: Analyze significant increases in the ordering volume of Controlled Substances using criteria to identify customers that exhibit percentage growth of Controlled Substances substantially in excess of the percentage growth of non-Controlled Substances. 4. Unusual formu lation ordering: Analyze ordering of Highly Diverted Controlled Substances to identify customers with significant ordering of high-risk formulations. High -risk formulations include, but are not limited to, 10mg hydrocodone, 8mg hydromorphone, without naloxone), and highly -abused formulations of oxycodone. On an annual basis (or as otherwise necessary), high -risk formulations of Highly Diverted Controlled Substances may be added, removed, o r revised based on the Injunctive Relief Distributors' assessment and regulatory guidance. 5. Out-of-area patients: Analyze Pharmacy Customer Data or Dispensing Data to assess volume of prescriptions for Highly Diverted Controlled Substances for out -of-area patients (based on number of miles traveled between a patient's zip code and the pharmacy location, depending on the geographic area of interest) taking into consideration the percentage of out-of-area patients for non -Controlled Substances. 6. Cash pres criptions: Analyze Pharmacy Customer Data or Dispensing Data to assess percentage of cash payments for purchases of Controlled Substances taking into consideration the percentage of cash payments for purchases of non -Controlled Substances. 7. Prescriber ac tivity of Customers: Analyze Pharmacy Customer Data or Dispensing Data to identify Customers that are dispensing Highly Diverted Controlled Substance prescriptions for Top Prescribers as follows: FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 P-11 a) Top Prescribers representing a significant volume of disp ensing where the prescriber's practice location is in excess of 50 miles from the pharmacy (\"out -of-area\"), relative to the percentage of out-of-area prescriptions for non -Controlled Substances. b) Top Prescribers representing prescriptions for the same Hi ghly Diverted Controlled Substances in the same quantities and dosage forms indicative of pattern prescribing (e.g., a prescriber providing many patients with the same high -dose, high -quantity supply of 30mg oxycodone HCL prescription without attention to the varying medical needs of the prescriber's patient population). c) Top Prescribers where the top five (5) or fewer prescribers represent more than fifty percent (50%) of total prescriptions for Highly Diverted Controlled Substances during a specified pe riod. 8. Public regulatory actions against Customers: Review information retrieved from companies that provide licensing and disciplinary history records (e.g., LexisNexis), and/or other public sources, including governmental entities, showing that the Cus tomer, pharmacists working for that Customer, or the Customer's Top Prescribers have been subject, in the last five (5) years, to professional disciplinary sanctions regarding the dispensing or handling of Controlled Substances or law enforcement action re lated to Controlled Substances diversion. Continued licensing by a relevant state agency may be considered, but shall not be dispositive, in resolving the Red Flag.

The Pharmacy Questionnaire shall also require disclosure of the identity of all other distributors that serve the potential Customer, and whether the potent ial Customer has been terminated or suspended from ordering Controlled Substances by another distributor and the reason for any termination or suspension. The Pharmacy Questionnaire shall request information that would allow the Injunctive Relief Distribut or to identify Red Flags, including questions regarding the manner in which the potential Customer maintains effective controls against the potential diversion of Controlled Substances. A potential Customer's responses to the Pharmacy Questionnaire shall b e verified, to the extent applicable and practicable, against external sources (for example, the Clearinghouse, once operational, and Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (\"ARCOS \") data made available to the Injunctive Relief Distributor by the FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 P-13 DEA). The Pharmacy Questionnaire shall be maintained by the Injunctive Relief Distributor in a database accessible to its CSMP personnel. 3. Complete a written onboarding report to be maintained in a database accessible to the Injunctive Relief Distri butor's CSMP personnel reflecting the findings of the interview and any site visit, the findings regarding the identification of and, if applicable, conclusion concerning any Red Flag associated with the pharmacy, as well as an analysis of the Pharmacy Que stionnaire referenced in the preceding paragraph. 4.

The sales departments of the Injunctive Relief Distributors shall not h ave the authority to establish or adjust Thresholds for any Customer or participate in any decisions regarding establishment or adjustment of Thresholds. C. Injunctive Relief Distributors shall not provide Customers specific information about their Thresho lds or how their Thresholds are calculated. 1. Threshold Setting a) Injunctive Relief Distributors shall primarily use model -based thresholds. For certain circumstances, Injunctive Relief Distributors may apply a non -model threshold based on documented cus tomer diligence and analysis. b) Each Injunctive Relief Distributor shall include in its Annual Threshold Analysis and Assessment Report (as required by Section XVIII.F.3.c) to the Monitor summary statistics regarding the use of non-model thresholds and su ch information shall be considered by the Monitor as part of its Threshold Setting Process Review in the annual Audit Report. c) For the purposes of establishing and maintaining Thresholds, each Injunctive Relief Distributor shall take into account the Con trolled Substances diversion risk of each drug base code. The diversion risk of each base code should be defined and reassessed annually by the Injunctive Relief Distributor's CSMP Committee and reviewed by the Monitor. d) Each Injunctive Relief Distributo r shall establish Thresholds for new Customers prior to supplying those Customers with Controlled Substances and shall continue to have Thresholds in place at all times for each Customer to which it supplies Controlled Substances. e) When ordering volume f rom other distributors becomes readily available from the Clearinghouse, an Injunctive Relief Distributor shall consider including such information as soon as reasonably practicable in establishing and maintaining Thresholds. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 P-17 f) Each Injunctive Relief Dist ributor shall incorporate the following guiding principles in establishing and maintaining Customer Thresholds, except when inapplicable to non -model Thresholds: (1) Thresholds shall take into account the number of non - Controlled Substance dosage units dis tributed to, dispensed and/or number of prescriptions dispensed by the Customer to assist with the determination of Customer size. As a general matter, smaller customers should have lower Thresholds than larger customers. (2) For the purposes of establishi ng and maintaining Thresholds, Injunctive Relief Distributors shall use statistical models that are appropriate to the underlying data. (3) For the purposes of establishing and maintaining Thresholds, Injunctive Relief Distributors shall take into account a Customer's ordering and/or dispensing history for a specified period of time. (4) For the purposes of establishing and maintaining Thresholds, Injunctive Relief Distributors shall take into account the ordering history of Customers within similar geograp hic regions, or, where appropriate for Chain Customers, ordering history within the chain. (5) If appropriate, Thresholds may take into account the characteristics of Customers with similar business models. (a) A Customer's statement that it employs a part icular business model must be verified, to the extent practicable, before that business model is taken into account in establishing and maintaining a Customer's Threshold. 2. Threshold Auditing a) The Injunctive Relief Distributors shall review their respe ctive Customer Thresholds at least on an annual basis and modify them where appropriate. b) Each Injunctive Relief Distributor's CSMP department shall annually evaluate its Threshold setting methodology and processes and its CSMP personnel's performance in adhering to those policies. 3. Threshold Changes FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 P-18 a) An Injunctive Relief Distributor may increase or decrease a Customer Threshold as set forth in its CSMP policies and procedures, subject to Sections XII.C.3.b through XII.C.3.e. b) Prior to approving any Threshold change request by a Customer, each Injunctive Relief Distributor shall conduct due diligence to determine whether an increase to the Threshold is warranted. This due diligence shall include obtaining from the Customer the basis for the Threshold change request, obtaining and reviewing Dispensing Data and/or Pharmacy Customer Data for the previous three (3) months for due diligence purposes, and, as needed, conducting an on -site visit to the Customer. This Threshold change request diligence shall be conducted by the Injunctive Relief Distributor's CSMP personnel. c) No Injunctive Relief Distributor shall proactively contact a Customer to suggest that the Customer request an increase to any of its Thresholds, to inform the Customer that its Orders -to-date are approaching its Thresholds or to recommend to the Customer the amount of a requested Threshold increase. It shall not be a violation of this paragraph to provide Chain Customer headquarters reporting on one or more individual Chain Customer pharmacy location(s) to support the anti -diversion efforts of the Chain Customer's headquarters staff, and it shall not be a violation of this paragraph for the Injunctive Relief Distributor's CSMP personnel to contact Customers to seek to understand a Custome r's ordering patterns. d) An Injunctive Relief Distributor's Chief Diversion Control Officer may approve criteria for potential adjustments to Customer Thresholds to account for circumstances where the Thresholds produced by the ordinary operation of the s tatistical models require modification. Such circumstances include adjustments to account for seasonal ordering of certain Controlled Substances that are based on documented diligence and analysis, adjustments made to permit ordering of certain Controlled Substances during a declared national or state emergency (e.g., COVID -19 pandemic), IT errors, and data anomalies causing results that are inconsistent with the design of the statistical models. Each Injunctive Relief Distributor shall include in its Annua l Threshold Analysis and Assessment Report (as required by Section XVIII.F.3.c) to the Monitor information regarding the use of this paragraph and such information shall be considered by the Monitor as part of its Threshold Setting Process Review in the an nual Audit Report. e) Any decision to raise a Customer's Threshold in response to a request by a Customer to adjust its Threshold must be documented FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 P-19 in a writing and state the reason(s) for the change. The decision must be consistent with the Injunctive R elief Distributor's CSMP and documented appropriately. XIII. SUSPICIOUS ORDER REPORTING AND NON -SHIPMENT A.

No Injunctive Relief Distributor shall ship any Order that it (i) reports pursuant to Sections XIII.A or XIII.B, or (ii) would have been required to report pursuant to Section s XIII.A or XIII.B had the Settling State elected to receive SORs. D. In reporting Suspicious Orders to the Settling States, the Injunctive Relief Distributors shall file SORs in a standardized electronic format that is uniform among the Settling States an d contains the following information fields: 1. Customer name; 2. Customer address; 3. DEA registration number; 4. State pharmacy license number; 5. Date of order; 6. NDC number; 7. Quantity; 8. Explanation for why the order is suspicious (up to 250 charac ters): Details that are order -specific regarding why an order was flagged as a Suspicious Order, including specific criteria used by an Injunctive Relief Distributor's Threshold system (except phrases such as \"order is of unusual size\" without any addition al detail are not acceptable); and 9. Name and contact information for a knowledgeable designee within the Injunctive Relief Distributor's CSMP department to be a point of contact for the SORs. E. On a quarterly basis, each Injunctive Relief Distributor sh all provide a summary report to the Settling States that elect to receive it that provides the following FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 P-20 information for the relevant quarter with respect to the top ten (10) Customers by volume for each Highly Diverted Controlled Substance base code that have placed a Suspicious Order for that base code, in that quarter (for Chain Customers, only individual pharmacies in the chain will considered for evaluation as a top ten (10) Customer): 1. The number of SORs submitted for that Customer by base code; 2. The Customer's order volume by base code for the quarter for all Highly Diverted Controlled Substances; 3. The Customer's order frequency by base code for the quarter for all Highly Diverted Controlled Substances; 4. For each Highly Diverted Controlled Sub stance base code, the ratio of the Customer's order volume for that base code to the volume of all pharmaceutical orders for the quarter; and 5. The ratio of the Customer's order volume of all Controlled Substances to the volume of all pharmaceutical order s for the quarter. F. The Injunctive Relief Distributors shall only be required to file a single, uniform, electronic form of SOR with any Settling State that receives SORs pursuant to these Injunctive Relief Terms. A Settling State retains the authority p ursuant to applicable state law or relevant state agency authority to request additional information about a particular SOR. G. It is the objective of the Settling States and the Injunctive Relief Distributors for the Injunctive Relief Distributors to prov ide SORs to Settling States that identify the same Suspicious Orders as reported to the DEA pursuant to the definition and requirements of the federal Controlled Substances Act and its regulations, although the fields of the SORs submitted to the Settling States as required by Section XIII may differ from the content required by the DEA. To the extent federal definitions and requirements materially change during the term of the Injunctive Relief Terms, the Injunctive Relief Distributors may be required to adjust the format and content of the SORs to meet these federal requirements. The Injunctive Relief Distributors and the State Compliance Review Committee will engage in good faith discussions regarding such adjustments. H. It shall not be a violation of th e Injunctive Relief Terms if an Injunctive Relief Distributor ships a Suspicious Order or fails to submit or transmit a SOR if: 1. The shipment of the Suspicious Order or failed SOR transmission was due to a computer error (data entry mistakes, coding erro rs, computer logic issues, software malfunctions, and other computer errors or IT failures); and FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 P-21 2. The Injunctive Relief Distributor reports the error, including a description of measures that will be taken to prevent recurrence of the error, to any affec ted Settling State, the State Compliance Review Committee, and the Monitor within five (5) business days of its discovery. XIV. TERMINATED CUSTOMERS A. Each Injunctive Relief Distributor shall report to the Clearinghouse, once operational, within five (5) business days (or as otherwise required by state statute or regulation), Customers it has terminated from eligibility to receive Controlled Substances or refused to onboard for the sale of Controlled Substances due to concerns regarding the Customer's abil ity to provide effective controls against the potential diversion of Controlled Substances following the Effective Date. B. The Injunctive Relief Distributors shall report to the relevant Settling State(s), within five (5) business days (or as otherwise re quired by state statute or regulation) Customers located in such Settling States that it has terminated from eligibility to receive Controlled Substances or refused to onboard for the sale of Controlled Substances due to concerns regarding the Customer's a bility to provide effective controls against the potential diversion of Controlled Substances following the Effective Date. Such reports will be made in a uniform format. The Injunctive Relief Distributors and the State Compliance Review Committee shall use best efforts to agree on such uniform format for inclusion prior to the requirement taking effect. C. In determining whether a Customer should be terminated from eligibility to receive Controlled Substances, Injunctive Relief Distributors shall apply fac tors set out in their CSMP policies and procedures, which shall include the following conduct by a Customer: 1. Has generated an excessive number of Suspicious Orders, which cannot otherwise be explained; 2. Has routinely demonstrated unresolved Red Flag a ctivity; 3. Has continued to fill prescriptions for Highly Diverted Controlled Substances that raise Red Flags following an Injunctive Relief Distributor's warning or communication about such practices; 4. Has failed to provide Pharmacy Customer Data or Di spensing Data in response to a request from an Injunctive Relief Distributor or otherwise refuses to cooperate with the Injunctive Relief Distributor's CSMP after providing the Customer with a reasonable amount of time to respond to the Injunctive Relief D istributor's requests; 5. Has been found to have made material omissions or false statements on a Pharmacy Questionnaire (the requirements for the contents of a Pharmacy Questionnaire are described in Section IX); or FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 P-22 6. Has been the subject of discipline b y a State Board of Pharmacy within the past three (3) years or has had its owner(s) or pharmacist -in-charge subject to license probation or termination within the past five (5) years by a State Board of Pharmacy for matters related to Controlled Substances dispensing or a federal or state felony conviction. D. Once the Clearinghouse has made Customer termination data available to each Injunctive Relief Distributor, each Injunctive Relief Distributor shall consider terminating Customers that have been termin ated from eligibility to receive Controlled Substances by another distributor as a result of suspected diversion of Controlled Substances if the Customer is ordering only Controlled Substances from the Injunctive Relief Distributor. If the Injunctive Relie f Distributor determines not to terminate Customers to which this paragraph applies, the Injunctive Relief Distributor shall document its decision -making. A good -faith decision to continue shipping Controlled Substances to Customers to which this paragraph applies, shall not serve, without more, as the basis of a future claim of non-compliance with the Injunctive Relief Terms. E. For Chain Customers, the provisions in Section XIV.A -D shall apply to the specific pharmacies in question. XV. EMERGENCIES A. In the circumstances of declared national or state emergencies in which the healthcare community relies on the Injunctive Relief Distributors for critical medicines, medical supplies, products, and services, the Injunctive Relief Distributors may be required to temporarily modify their respective CSMP processes to meet the critical needs of the supply chain. These modifications may conflict with the requirements of the Injunctive Relief Terms. B. In the case of a declared national or state emergency, the Injun ctive Relief Distributors shall be required to give notice to the State Compliance Review Committee of any temporary material changes to their CSMP processes which may conflict with the requirements of the Injunctive Relief Terms and specify the sections o f the Injunctive Relief Terms which will be affected by the temporary change. C. The Injunctive Relief Distributors shall document all temporary changes to their CSMP processes and appropriately document all customer -specific actions taken as a result of t he declared national or state emergency. D. The Injunctive Relief Distributors shall provide notice to the State Compliance Review Committee at the conclusion of the declared national or state emergency, or sooner, stating that the temporary CSMP processes put into place have been suspended. E. Provided the Injunctive Relief Distributors comply with the provisions of Sections XV.A through XV.D, the Injunctive Relief Distributors will not face liability for FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 P-23 any deviations from the requirements of the Injunct ive Relief Terms taken in good faith to meet the critical needs of the supply chain in response to the declared national or state emergency. Nothing herein shall limit Settling States from pursuing claims against the Injunctive Relief Distributors based on deviations from the requirements of the Injunctive Relief Terms not taken in good faith to meet the critical needs of the supply chain in response to a declared national or state emergency. XVI. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND RECORDKEEPING A. The Injunctive Rel ief Distributors acknowledge and agree that they must comply with applicable state and federal laws governing the distribution of Controlled Substances. B. Good faith compliance with the Injunctive Relief Terms creates a presumption that the Injunctive Rel ief Distributors are acting reasonably and in the public interest with respect to Settling States' existing laws requiring effective controls against diversion of Controlled Substances and with respect to the identification, reporting, and blocking of Susp icious Orders of Controlled Substances. C. The requirements of the Injunctive Relief Terms are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other requirements of state or federal law applicable to Controlled Substances distribution. Except as provided in Sectio n XVI.D, nothing in the Injunctive Relief Terms shall be construed as relieving Injunctive Relief Distributors of the obligation to comply with such laws, regulations, or rules. No provision of the Injunctive Relief Terms shall be deemed as permission for Injunctive Relief Distributors to engage in any acts or practices prohibited by such laws, regulations, or rules. D. In the event of a conflict between the requirements of the Injunctive Relief Terms and any other law, regulation, or requirement such that an Injunctive Relief Distributor cannot comply with the law without violating the Injunctive Relief Terms or being subject to adverse action, including fines and penalties, the Injunctive Relief Distributor shall document such conflicts and notify the Stat e Compliance Review Committee and any affected Settling State the extent to which it will comply with the Injunctive Relief Terms in order to eliminate the conflict within thirty (30) days of the Injunctive Relief Distributor's discovery of the conflict. T he Injunctive Relief Distributor shall comply with the Injunctive Relief Terms to the fullest extent possible without violating the law. E. In the event of a change or modification of federal or state law governing the distribution of Controlled Substances that creates an actual or potential conflict with the Injunctive Relief Terms, any Injunctive Relief Distributor, any affected Settling State, or the State Compliance Review Committee may request that the Injunctive Relief Distributors, State Compliance R eview Committee, and any affected Settling State meet and confer regarding the law change. During the meet and confer, the Injunctive Relief Distributors, the State Compliance Review FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 P-24 Committee, and any affected Settling State will address whether the chang e or modification in federal or state law requires an amendment to the Injunctive Relief Terms. In the event the Injunctive Relief Distributors, the State Compliance Review Committee, and any affect ed Settling State cannot agree on a resolution, and the di spute relates to whether the generally applicable Injunctive Relief Terms herein should be changed, an Injunctive Relief Distributor, the State Compliance Review Committee , or any affected Settling State may submit the question to the National Arbitration Panel. If the dispute relates to whether a change in an individual State's law requires a modification of the Injunctive Relief Terms only with respect to that State, an Injunctive Relief Distributor, the State Compliance Review Committee, or any affected Settling State may seek resolution of the dispute pursuant to Section XIX. Maintenance of competition in the industry and the potential burden of inconsistent obligations by Injunctive Relief Distributors shall be a relevant consideration in such resolutio n. F. Recordkeeping: Each Injunctive Relief Distributor shall retain records it is required to create pursuant to its obligations hereunder in an electronic or otherwise readily accessible format. The Settling States shall have the right to review records provided to the Monitor pursuant to Section XVIII. Nothing in the Injunctive Relief Terms prohibits a Settling State from issuing a lawful subpoena for records pursuant to an applicable law. XVII. CLEARINGHOUSE A. Creation of the Clearinghouse 1. The Clea ringhouse functions shall be undertaken by a third -party vendor or vendors. 2. The vendor(s) will be chosen through a process developed and jointly agreed upon by the Injunctive Relief Distributors and the State Compliance Review Committee. 3. Consistent w ith the process developed by the Injunctive Relief Distributors and the State Compliance Review Committee, within two (2) months of the Effective Date, the Injunctive Relief Distributors shall issue a Request for Proposal to develop the systems and capabil ities for a Clearinghouse to perform the services of a data aggregator. 4. Within five (5) months of the Effective Date, the Clearinghouse Advisory Panel shall select one or more entities to develop the systems for the Clearinghouse and perform data aggreg ator services. The Clearinghouse Advisory Panel shall select a vendor or vendors that employ or retain personnel who have adequate expertise and experience related to the pharmaceutical industry, the distribution of Controlled Substances, and the applicabl e requirements of the Controlled Substances Act and the DEA's implementing regulations. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 P-25 5. Within sixty (60) days of the selection of a vendor(s) to serve as the Clearinghouse, the Injunctive Relief Distributors shall negotiate and finalize a contract with the vendor(s). The date that the contract is signed by the Injunctive Relief Distributors and the vendor(s) shall be referred to as the \" Clearinghouse Retention Date .\" 6. The development of the Clearinghouse shall proceed on a phased approach as discussed in Sections XVII.C and XVII.D. B. Governance and Staffing of the Clearinghouse 1. Capabilities. The selected vendor or vendors shall staff the Clearinghouse in a manner that ensures the development of robust data collection, analytics and reporting capabi lities for the Settling States and Injunctive Relief Distributors. To the extent additional expertise is required for the engagement, the vendor(s) may retain the services of third -party consultants. 2. Independence. While performing services for the Clear inghouse, all vendors and consultants, and their staff working on the Clearinghouse, shall be independent ( i.e., not perform services of any kind, including as a consultant or an employee on behalf of any Injunctive Relief Distributor outside of the ordina ry business operations of the Clearinghouse). Independence may be achieved by implementing appropriate ethical walls with employees who are currently performing or who have previously performed work for an Injunctive Relief Distributor within two years of the Clearinghouse Retention Date. 3. Liability . The Injunctive Relief Distributors are entitled to rely upon information or data received from the Clearinghouse, whether in oral, written, or other form. No Injunctive Relief Distributor, and no individual serving on the Clearinghouse Advisory Panel, shall have any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract or tort or otherwise) to any Party for or in connection with any action taken or not taken by the Clearinghouse. In addition, no Injunctive Relief Distributor, and no individual serving on the Clearinghouse Advisory Panel, shall have any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract or tort or otherwise) to any Party for or in connection with any action taken or not taken by an Injunctive Relie f Distributor based on incorrect, inaccurate, incomplete or otherwise erroneous information or data provided by the Clearinghouse, unless the information or data was incorrect, inaccurate, incomplete or otherwise erroneous because the Injunctive Relief Dis tributor itself provided incorrect, inaccurate, incomplete or otherwise erroneous data or information to the Clearinghouse. For any legal requirements that are assumed by the Clearinghouse during Phase 2 -B pursuant to Section XVII.D.3, liability shall be a ddressed pursuant to Section XVII.D.3.c. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 P-26 4. Clearinghouse Advisory Panel . The State Compliance Review Committee and Injunctive Relief Distributors shall create a Clearinghouse Advisory Panel no later than sixty (60) days after the Effective Date to overse e the Clearinghouse. a) The Clearinghouse Advisory Panel shall have an equal number of members chosen by the State Compliance Review Committee on the one hand, and the Injunctive Relief Distributors on the other. The size of the Clearinghouse Advisory Pane l will be decided by the State Compliance Review Committee and the Injunctive Relief Distributors, and the State Compliance Review Committee and the Injunctive Relief Distributors may select as members third -party experts, but no more than one half of each side's representatives may be such third -party experts. At least one member chosen by the State Compliance Review Committee will be based on consultation with the National Association of State Controlled Substances Authorities. b) During the first two yea rs of the operation of the Clearinghouse, the Clearinghouse Advisory Panel shall meet (in -person or remotely) at least once per month. After the first two years of operation, the Clearinghouse Advisory Panel shall meet at least quarterly. The Monitor may a ttend Clearinghouse Advisory Panel meetings and may provide recommendations to the Clearinghouse Advisory Panel. c) The Clearinghouse Advisory Panel shall establish a subcommittee to advise on issues related to privacy, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\" HIPAA \"), and data security and a subcommittee to advise on issues related to Dispensing Data. It may establish additional subcommittees. Subcommittees may include individuals who are not members of the Clearinghouse Advisory P anel. The Clearinghouse Advisory Panel may invite one or more prescribers, dispensers, and representatives from state Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (\"PDMP \") to serve on the Dispensing Data subcommittee. Each Injunctive Relief Distributor shall have a representative on each subcommittee created by the Clearinghouse Advisory Panel. d) The Clearinghouse Advisory Panel may delegate tasks assigned to it by the Injunctive Relief Terms to the Executive Director. 5. Executive Director . One employee of the v endor, or one representative from the vendor group in the event that there are multiple vendors, shall be an Executive Director who shall manage day -to-day operations and report periodically to the Clearinghouse Advisory Panel. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 P-27 C. Phase 1 of the Clearingho use: Data Collection, Initial Analytics and Reporting 1. System Development a) Within one (1) year of the Clearinghouse Retention Date, the Clearinghouse shall develop systems to receive and analyze data obtained from the Injunctive Relief Distributors pur suant to electronic transmission formats to be agreed upon by the Clearinghouse Advisory Panel. b) In developing such systems, the Clearinghouse shall ensure that: (1) The systems provide robust reporting and analytic capabilities. (2) Data obtained from I njunctive Relief Distributors shall be automatically pulled from the existing order management data platforms (e.g., SAP). (3) The systems shall be designed to receive data from sources other than the Injunctive Relief Distributors, including pharmacies, n on-Injunctive Relief Distributors, the DEA, State Boards of Pharmacy, and other relevant sources, pursuant to standardized electronic transmission formats. (4) The systems shall be designed to protect personally identifiable information (\" PII\") and protect ed health information (\" PHI\") from disclosure and shall comply with HIPAA and any federal and state laws relating to the protection of PII and PHI. (5) The Clearinghouse will establish a HIPAA -compliant database that can be accessed by state authorities, t he Injunctive Relief Distributors, and any entities that subsequently participate in the Clearinghouse. The database that will be made available to the Injunctive Relief Distributors and any non -governmental entities that subsequently participate in the Cl earinghouse will also blind commercially sensitive information. (6) State authorities shall have access to the HIPAA -compliant database via web -based tools and no additional or specialized equipment or software shall be required. This access shall allow st ate authorities to query the HIPAA - compliant database without limitation. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 P-28 (7) The Injunctive Relief Distributors shall be permitted to use data obtained from the Clearinghouse for anti -diversion purposes, including the uses expressly contemplated by the Injunctive Relief Terms. The Injunctive Relief Distributors shall not sell (or obtain license fees for) data obtained from Clearinghouse to any third -parties. Nothing in the Injunctive Relief Terms shall prohibit an Injunctive Relief Distributor from using i ts own data, including data provided to the Injunctive Relief Distributor by third - parties other than the Clearinghouse, for any commercial purposes, including selling or licensing its data to third - parties. 2. Aggregation of Data a) It is the goal of the Settling States and the Injunctive Relief Distributors for the Clearinghouse to obtain comprehensive data from all distributors, pharmacies, and other relevant data sources to provide maximum permissible transparency into the distribution and dispensing of Controlled Substances. During Phase 1, the Clearinghouse Advisory Panel shall develop recommendations for ways to achieve this goal. b) In Phase 1, the Injunctive Relief Distributors shall provide and/or facilitate the collection of, and the Clearinghouse shall collect and maintain, the following: (1) Injunctive Relief Distributor transaction data for Controlled Substances and non -Controlled Substances, specified at the NDC, date, quantity, and customer level. (2) Injunctive Relief Distributor information on Customers that have been terminated and/or declined onboarding due to concerns regarding Controlled Substance dispensing following the Effective Date. c) The Clearinghouse shall make available to the Injunctive Relief Distributors, in a format to be det ermined by the Clearinghouse Advisory Panel, blinded data for their CSMP due diligence functions. The data will include all Controlled Substances and non - Controlled Substances and be refreshed on a regular basis. The Clearinghouse will also seek to provide non-identifying information regarding whether a single distributor is associated with multiple warehouses with unique DEA registrations (e.g., multiple distribution centers operated by a single distributor), in the data it makes available. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 P-29 d) During Phase 1, the Clearinghouse Advisory Panel (with input from its Dispensing Data subcommittee) will develop an operational plan to obtain Dispensing Data directly from pharmacies, unless the Clearinghouse Advisory Panel determines it is inadvisable to do so. The operational plan developed by the Clearinghouse Advisory Panel shall address compliance with HIPAA and shall include recommendations to facilitate the collection of Dispensing Data in compliance with HIPAA and relevant state privacy laws. To the extent pos sible, the Clearinghouse will begin collecting Dispensing Data during Phase 1. e) Nothing in the Injunctive Relief Terms shall require the Injunctive Relief Distributors to indemnify or otherwise be responsible to pharmacy customers for any claims resultin g from the provision of Dispensing Data to the Clearinghouse, including, but not limited to, claims related to any data breaches occurring with the data transmitted to or maintained by the Clearinghouse. 3. State and Federal Reporting Requirements a) The I njunctive Relief Distributors shall comply with state and federal transactional and Suspicious Order reporting requirements related to Controlled Substances as follows: (1) Until such time as the Clearinghouse is able to provide transactional and Suspiciou s Order regulatory reporting to the states on behalf of the Injunctive Relief Distributors, the Injunctive Relief Distributors shall continue to file all required reports under state law and those reports required by these Injunctive Relief Terms. (2) Once the Clearinghouse is able to process and submit such reports, the Clearinghouse may process and submit those reports on behalf of each Injunctive Relief Distributor to the states. At all times during Phase 1, each Injunctive Relief Distributor shall remai n responsible for the identification of Suspicious Orders and will remain liable for a failure to submit transactional data or Suspicious Order reports required under state law or these Injunctive Relief Terms. (3) An Injunctive Relief Distributor may elec t to fulfill its reporting obligations directly, rather than have the Clearinghouse assume the responsibility for the transmission of the various reports. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 P-30 4. Additional Reports and Analytics a) In consultation with the Clearinghouse Advisory Panel, the Clearinghouse shall work to develop additional reports and analyses to assist the Settling States and the Injunctive Relief Distributors in addressing Controlled Substance diversion, including, but not limited to, identifying Red Flags consistent with Section VIII. b) The Clearinghouse will generate analyses and reports to be used by the Settling States and the Injunctive Relief Distributors based on format and content recommended by the Clearinghouse Advisory Panel. In order to refine the format and reach fin al recommendations, the Clearinghouse shall prepare sample analytical reports for a sample geographic region to review with the Clearinghouse Advisory Panel. The sample reports will also be shared with the DEA in an effort to receive additional feedback. c) After the content and format of the sample reports have been approved by the Clearinghouse Advisory Panel, the Clearinghouse will begin producing reports on a periodic basis. d) The Clearinghouse will develop capabilities to provide Settling States custo mized reports upon reasonable request to assist in their efforts to combat the diversion of Controlled Substances and for other public health and regulatory purposes. e) After the Clearinghouse has obtained sufficient Dispensing Data from Customers, the Cl earinghouse shall commence providing standard reports to the Settling States and Injunctive Relief Distributors that will include summaries and analysis of Dispensing Data. The reports and analytics of Dispensing Data shall be developed in consultation wit h the Clearinghouse Advisory Panel (including its Dispensing Data subcommittee) and shall include, but not be limited to: (1) Identification of Customers whose dispensing may indicate Red Flags consistent with Section VIII, as determined by the Clearinghou se from aggregate data; and (2) Identification of Customers whose aggregate dispensing volumes for Highly Diverted Controlled Substances are disproportionately high relative to the population of the relevant geographic area. f) The Clearinghouse shall also prepare reports and analyses for the Settling States and Injunctive Relief Distributors identifying prescribers whose prescribing behavior suggests they may not be FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 P-31 engaged in the legitimate practice of medicine. Such reports and analysis shall be develope d in consultation with the Clearinghouse Advisory Panel (including its Dispensing Data subcommittee) and shall seek to identify and evaluate: (1) Prescribers who routinely prescribe large volumes of Highly Diverted Controlled Substances relative to other prescribers with similar specialties, including health care professionals who prescribe a large number of prescriptions for high dosage amounts of Highly Diverted Controlled Substances; (2) Prescribers whose prescriptions for Highly Diverted Controlled Subs tances are routinely and disproportionately filled in a geographic area that is unusual based on the prescriber's location; and (3) Prescribers who routinely prescribe out -of-specialty or out - of-practice area without legitimate reason. g) Reports or analys is generated by the Clearinghouse may not be based on complete data due to a lack of participation by non - Injunctive Relief Distributors and pharmacies. As such, Injunctive Relief Distributors shall not be held responsible for actions or inactions related to reports and analysis prepared by the Clearinghouse which may be based on incomplete data due to a lack of participation by non -Injunctive Relief Distributors and pharmacies. D. Phase 2 of the Clearinghouse: Additional Data Collection and Analytics and Assumption of CSMP Functions Within one (1) year of Phase 1 of the Clearinghouse being operational, the Clearinghouse and the Clearinghouse Advisory Panel shall develop a detailed strategic and implementation plan for Phase 2 of the Clearinghouse (\" Phase 2 Planning Report \"). Phase 2 will consist of two parts. Phase 2 -A will focus on increasing data collection from non -Injunctive Relief Distributors, pharmacies and other data sources and developing enhanced analytics based on the experiences gained from Phase 1. Phase 2 -A will also include recommendations for the development of uniform federal and state reporting. Phase 2 -B will involve the potential assumption of various CSMP activities, including Threshold setting and order management by the Clearinghouse. T he Phase 2 Planning Report will address both Phase 2 -A and Phase 2 -B. After the completion of the Phase 2 Planning Report, individual Injunctive Relief Distributors, in their sole discretion, may elect not to proceed with Phase 2 -B as provided by Section X VII.E. If one or more Injunctive Relief Distributors elect to proceed with Phase 2 -B, the goal will be to have Phase 2 -B fully operational within two (2) years of the Clearinghouse FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 P-32 Retention Date and no later than three (3) years of the Clearinghouse Reten tion Date. 1. Phase 2 -A: Additional Data Collection and Analytics a) During Phase 2 -A, the Clearinghouse will continue the functions defined in Phase 1 and work to expand the scope of its data collection and enhance its analytics and reporting capabilities including the following: (1) Integration of data from additional sources, including: (a) Transaction data from other distributors, including manufacturers that distribute directly to retail pharmacies and pharmacies that self -warehouse; and (b) Where poss ible, state PDMP data and other data, including, but not limited to, State Board of Medicine and Board of Pharmacy sanctions, and agreed -upon industry data. If state PDMP data is effectively duplicative of Dispensing Data already obtained in Phase 1, it wi ll not be necessary for the Clearinghouse to obtain state PDMP data. (2) Development of additional metrics analyzing the data available from the additional data sources (PDMP, other pharmacy data, sanction authorities, and third -party volume projections). (3) Development of real -time or near real -time access to distribution data, dispensing data and other data sources. (4) Refinement of methodologies for analyzing Dispensing Data to identify suspicious prescribers. (5) Development of additional capabilities to provide Settling States, the Injunctive Relief Distributors and potentially the DEA customized reporting from the Clearinghouse upon reasonable request. 2. Phase 2 -A: Uniform Required Reporting a) The Clearinghouse and the Clearinghouse Advisory Panel shall develop uniform reporting recommendations for potential implementation by state regulators in order to allow the Injunctive Relief Distributors to satisfy their obligations under the Injunctive FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 P-33 Relief Terms and state and federal laws in a uniform and consistent manner. b) It is a goal of the Settling States and the Injunctive Relief Distributors to: (1) Streamline and simplify required reporting which will benefit the Injunctive Relief Distributors and the Settling States, as well as the DEA; (2) Develop uniform transactional and Suspicious Order reporting requirements; and (3) Provide for the submission of uniform Suspicious Order reports. 3. Phase 2 -B: Clearinghouse Assumption of CSMP Functions a) With respect to Phase 2 -B, the Phase 2 Planning Repo rt shall address: (1) Engagement with stakeholders, including the DEA, to develop the system of Threshold setting and Suspicious Order reporting to potentially be provided by the Clearinghouse; (2) Development of technology and rules, including any propose d changes to federal law or regulations; (3) Development of models for the identification of Suspicious Orders and setting universal Thresholds in a manner consistent with Section XII. These models shall include active order management and order fulfillmen t protocols to ensure that orders are compared to relevant Thresholds by the Clearinghouse before shipment instructions are provided by the Clearinghouse to the Injunctive Relief Distributors. The models shall also include the identification of Suspicious Orders when they are placed by Customers, which will be held before shipment or blocked based on instructions provided by the Clearinghouse to the Injunctive Relief Distributors. (4) Development of criteria governing distribution to Customers that have pla ced one or more Orders that exceed a Threshold; FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 P-34 (5) Development of rules for allocating Orders placed by Customers that have more than one Distributor if one or more Orders exceed a Threshold; (6) Development of a pilot project for a sample geographic region to perform data analysis to test the models for Threshold setting and the identification of Suspicious Orders. b) Following implementation of Phase 2 -B, the Injunctive Relief Distributors participating in Phase 2 -B and the State Compliance Review Commit tee shall meet and confer with respect to whether to expand the scope of the Clearinghouse to cover additional anti - diversion functions, such as the performance of due diligence. c) CSMP functions that have been assumed by the Clearinghouse during Phase 2 -B will no longer be performed by participating Injunctive Relief Distributors individually through their CSMPs. CSMP functions performed by the Clearinghouse will assist participating Injunctive Relief Distributors to satisfy the applicable legal obligatio ns of those Injunctive Relief Distributors. The Clearinghouse's performance of CSMP functions will not relieve participating Injunctive Relief Distributors from their legal obligations unless (i) the Injunctive Relief Distributors and the State Compliance Review Committee jointly enter into a written agreement for the Clearinghouse to assume legal requirements during Phase 2 -B; and (ii) all vendors and consultants working on the Clearinghouse agree in writing to assume such obligations. Nothing in this para graph shall apply to any Injunctive Relief Distributor that does not participate in Phase 2 -B pursuant to Section XVII.E. E. Option to Opt Out of Phase 2 -B 1. Each Injunctive Relief Distributor shall have the option, in its sole discretion, to elect not to participate in Phase 2 -B at any point. In the event that an Injunctive Relief Distributor elects not to participate in Phase 2 -B, that Injunctive Relief Distributor shall cease to have any obligation to fund future costs directly related to Phase 2 -B of t he Clearinghouse or to implement the Clearinghouse's determinations as to identification of Suspicious Orders and Suspicious Order reporting. If an Injunctive Relief Distributor elects not to participate in Phase 2 -B, that Injunctive Relief Distributor sha ll remain responsible for the requirements specified for Phase 1 and Phase 2 -A of the Clearinghouse and shall be responsible for contributing to the costs associated with Phase 1 and Phase 2 -A. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 P-35 2. In the event that an Injunctive Relief Distributor elects n ot to participate in Phase 2 -B, the Clearinghouse Advisory Panel shall discuss and make recommendations for any necessary adjustments to the Phase 2 -B capabilities described in Section XVII.D.3. F. Funding 1. The establishment and ongoing operations of th e Clearinghouse shall be funded by the Injunctive Relief Distributors for a period of ten (10) years commencing on the Clearinghouse Retention Date. 2. For each of the first two (2) years of the operation of the Clearinghouse, the Injunctive Relief Distrib utors will make total payments of $7.5 million per year combined. For years three (3) through ten (10), the Injunctive Relief Distributors will make total payments of $3 million per year combined. Additional costs associated with Phase 2 -B shall be billed to the Injunctive Relief Distributors participating in Phase 2 -B. 3. Payments by the Injunctive Relief Distributors for the Clearinghouse shall be allocated among the Injunctive Relief Distributors as set forth in Section IV.H of the Settlement Agreement, dated as of July 21, 2021, which incorporates these Injunctive Relief Terms as Exhibit P . 4. In the event that the cost of the Clearinghouse exceeds the amounts provided by the Injunctive Relief Distributors, the Injunctive Relief Distributors and State Compliance Review Committee shall meet -and- confer on alternatives, which may include: a) Limiting the operations of the Clearinghouse consistent with a revised budget; b) Seeking additional sources of funding for t he Clearinghouse; and/or c) Allocating, in a manner consistent with the allocation of payments between the Injunctive Relief Distributors as set forth in Section XVII.F.3, additional amounts that are the responsibility of the Injunctive Relief Distributors to be used for the operation of the Clearinghouse. 5. The Injunctive Relief Distributors and the State Compliance Review Committee agree to engage in good faith discussions regarding potential continued operation and funding of the Clearinghouse following the initial ten (10) year period of Clearinghouse operations. 6.

The Settling States' Attorneys' General agree to make best efforts to ensure that any other settling distributors and/or pharmacies participate in the Clearinghouse. To the extent that the Attorneys General are able to secur e participation by additional distributors and/or pharmacies, it is anticipated that, to the extent practicable based on the financial and relative size of the settling distributor and/or pharmacy, those entities will contribute to the cost of the operatio n of the Clearinghouse. The Injunctive Relief Distributors' obligation to fund the Clearinghouse shall be partially reduced by contributions obtained from other distributors and/or pharmacies pursuant to a formula to be determined by the Clearinghouse Advi sory Panel. G. Confidentiality 1. All data provided to the Clearinghouse shall be confidential. 2.

Such information may only be used by receiving distributors for purposes of identifying, minimizing, or otherwise addressing the risk of Controlled Substances diversion. No distributor or pharmacy, including the Injunctive Relief Distributors, shall attempt to obtain revenue from this information. Such information provided by the Clearinghouse shall be compliant with all applicable laws and regulations. 4. If the Clearinghouse receives a request for disclosure of any data, material or other information created or shared under the Injunctive Relief Terms, pursuant to a Third Party Request, the Clearinghouse shall notify the FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 P-37 Injunctive Relief Distributors and the Clearinghouse Advisory Panel of the Third Party Request and any confidential information to be disclosed so that the Injunctive Relief Distributors may seek a protective order or otherwise challenge or object to the disclosure.

The Monitor shall employ or retain personnel who have appropriate qualifications related to the pharmaceutical industry and the laws governing the distribution of pharmaceuticals, the distribution of Controlled Substances, and the applicable requir ements of federal and state law. The Monitor may also employ or retain personnel who have appropriate qualifications in the audit and review of sample documents in order to conduct the reviews described in Section XVIII.F. To the extent additional expertis e is required for the engagement, the Monitor may retain the services of third -party consultants. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 P-38 2. The Monitor must perform each review described in Section XVIII.F in a professionally independent and objective fashion, as defined in the most recent Gove rnment Auditing Standards issued by the United States Government Accountability Office. A Monitor shall not be engaged in active litigation involving one or more of the Injunctive Relief Distributors or Settling States or present a potential conflict of in terest involving matters concerning an Injunctive Relief Distributor, except by agreement of the affected parties. If the Monitor is employed by an entity that performed work for any Injunctive Relief Distributor or any of the Settling States prior to the Effective Date, the Monitor will cause to be implemented appropriate ethical walls between the Monitor team and the employees of the firm who have previously performed work for an Injunctive Relief Distributor or any of the Settling States. 3. The process for selecting the Monitor shall be as follows: a) Within sixty (60) calendar days of the Effective Date, the Injunctive Relief Distributors and the State Compliance Review Committee shall exchange pools of recommended candidates to serve as the Monitor. Th e pools shall each contain the names of three (3) individuals, groups of individuals, or firms. b) After receiving the pools of Monitor candidates, the Injunctive Relief Distributors and the State Compliance Review Committee shall have the right to meet wi th the candidates and conduct appropriate interviews of the personnel who are expected to work on the project. The Injunctive Relief Distributors (individually or in combination) and the State Compliance Review Committee may veto any of the candidates, and must do so in writing within thirty (30) days of receiving the pool of candidates. If all three (3) candidates within a pool are rejected by either the Injunctive Relief Distributors or the State Compliance Review Committee, the party who rejected the thr ee (3) candidates may direct the other party to provide up to three (3) additional qualified candidates within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of said notice. c) If the Injunctive Relief Distributors or the State Compliance Review Committee do not obj ect to a proposed candidate, the Injunctive Relief Distributors or the State Compliance Review Committee shall so notify the other in writing within thirty (30) days of receiving the pool of candidates. If more than one candidate remains, the State Complia nce Review Committee shall select the Monitor from the remaining candidates. Within thirty (30) calendar days of the selection of the Monitor, the Injunctive Relief Distributors shall retain the Monitor, and finalize all terms of engagement, supplying a co py of an engagement letter to the State Compliance Review Committee. The terms of engagement FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 P-39 shall include a process by which Injunctive Relief Distributors may challenge Monitor costs as excessive, duplicative or unnecessary, which process must be approve d by the State Compliance Review Committee. 4. The Injunctive Relief Distributors shall be responsible for the Monitor's fees and costs directly related to its performance of the work specified by the Injunctive Relief Terms up to a limit of $1,000,000 per year per Injunctive Relief Distributor ( i.e., a total of $3,000,000 per year). 5. Prior to each year, the Monitor shall submit a combined annual budget to the Injunctive Relief Distributors and State Compliance Review Committee that shall not exceed a tot al of $3,000,000. The Monitor shall submit quarterly reports to the Injunctive Relief Distributors and the State Compliance Review Committee tracking actual spend to the annual budget. 6. In the event that any of the Injunctive Relief Distributors or State Compliance Review Committee believe that the Monitor is not performing its duties and responsibilities under the Injunctive Relief Terms in a reasonably cost effective manner, an Injunctive Relief Distributor or the State Compliance Review Committee shall recommend in writing changes to the Monitor's practices to reduce cost. The Monitor, Injunctive Relief Distributors, and the State Compliance Review Committee shall meet and confer in good faith in response to such a recommendation. 7. In the event that t he Injunctive Relief Distributor and the State Compliance Review Committee cannot agree on whether the recommended cost reductions are warranted, either the State Compliance Review Committee or the Injunctive Relief Distributors may submit the question to the National Arbitration Panel, who shall determine whether the Monitor is performing its duties and responsibilities under the Injunctive Relief Terms in a reasonably cost effective manner, and, if not, the necessary changes to the Monitor's practices to reduce cost. 8. If the National Arbitration Panel determines that the Monitor cannot complete the reviews described in Section XVIII.F within the combined annual budget of $3,000,000, the National Arbitration Panel shall require the Monitor to provide the Injunctive Relief Distributors and the State Compliance Review Committee with a written report explaining why it is not possible to complete the reviews within budget and all steps the Monitor has taken to perform its duties and responsibilities under the Injunctive Relief Terms in a reasonably cost effective manner. After receiving the Monitor's report, the Injunctive Relief Distributors, and the State Compliance Review Committee shall meet and confer in good faith to determine whether an increase in the c ombined budget is appropriate. If the Injunctive Relief Distributors and the State Compliance Review FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 P-40 Committee cannot reach an agreement on the amount of the reasonable costs in excess of $3,000,000 for the relevant year, the issue will be submitted to the National Arbitration Panel for resolution. The National Arbitration Panel may award additional costs up to total cap of $5,000,000 for the relevant year ($3,000,000 plus an additional $2, 000,000). 9. Unless the Injunctive Relief Distributors and the State Compliance Review Committee agree otherwise as part of the meet and confer process in the prior paragraph (such as by agreeing to limit the Monitor's duties and responsibilities for the remainder of the year), the amount above $3,000,000 and up to the tot al cap of $5,000,000 in a given year necessary for the Monitor to complete the reviews described in Section XVIII.F shall be divided evenly among the Injunctive Relief Distributors without reducing any other amounts that are the responsibility of the Injun ctive Relief Distributors. B. Early Termination of the Monitor 1. In the event any of the Injunctive Relief Distributors or State Compliance Review Committee believe that the Monitor is not performing its duties and responsibilities under the Injunctive Re lief Terms in a reasonably professional, competent and independent manner, an Injunctive Relief Distributor or the State Compliance Review Committee shall recommend replacement of the Monitor in writing. The Injunctive Relief Distributors and the State Com pliance Review Committee shall meet and confer in good faith in response to a recommendation to replace the Monitor. If the State Compliance Review Committee and the Injunctive Relief Distributors agree that the Monitor should be replaced, a replacement Monitor will be selected in the manner set forth in Section XVIII.A.3. 2. In the event the Injunctive Relief Distributor and the State Compliance Review Committee cannot agree on whether the Monitor should be replaced, either the State Compliance Review Comm ittee or the Injunctive Relief Distributors may submit the question of the Monitor's dismissal to the National Arbitration Panel, and the Monitor shall only be dismissed if that panel finds that there is Good Cause for dismissal. Good Cause for dismissal s hall mean (a) a material and substantial breach of the terms of the Monitor's obligations under the Injunctive Relief Terms; (b) any act of dishonesty, misappropriation, embezzlement, intentional fraud, or similar conduct by the Monitor; (c) any clear patt ern of bias or prejudice in favor or against any party by the Monitor; (d) conduct by the Monitor that demonstrates unfitness to fulfill the functions of the Monitor reasonably and competently; or (e) conflicts of interest described in Section XVIII.A.2.

If the Monitor believes that the matter was not resolved, the Monitor shall immediately report the issue to the State Compliance Review Committee. 4. To the extent any of the documents requested by the Monitor contain material protected from disclosure by any legal privilege, including the attorney -client privi lege or attorney work product protections, an Injunctive Relief Distributor may redact such material before providing the documents to the Monitor, but must provide the Monitor with a privilege log describing the redacted information and identifying the ba sis for redaction. 5.

Awards of fees from the Contingency Fee Fund shall be available to Attorneys with Qualifying Representations of Participating Litigating Subdivisions eligible to receive an allocation under the Distributor Agreement, as set forth in Exhibit G to the Distributor Agreement, and shall be made applying the Mathematical Model attached as Exhibit A to this Fee Agreement (\" Mathematical Model \"). The collection of the data and calculations for the Mathematical Model has been a cooperative effort among p rivate counsel for a large number of Litigating Subdivisions. The analysis has been spearheaded by Joseph Tann and Andrew Arnold. The Fee Panel is encouraged to continue working with those counsel in application of the Model. The Fee Panel shall oversee the application of the Model and resolve any questions or disputes concerning the eligibility of an Attorney to participate as required in Section II.G. The Panel is empowered to hear disputes concerning and ensure the accuracy of the mathematical calcul ation. 4. As to awards from the Contingency Fee Fund, there shall be no right of appeal. 5. Any appeal of an award of the Fee Panel from the Common Benefit Fund will be made to the MDL Court and be reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. C. Common Ben efit Fund. (60% of the Attorney Fee Fund.) 1. Funds in the Attorney Fee Fund shall be allocated to the Common Benefit Fund according to the schedule set forth below, subject to the adjustments described in Section II.C.5. The payments are to be made on the f ollowing yearly schedule, subject to the adjustments set forth below: Payment Year 1 $81,626,627.22 Payment Year 2 $90,560,946.75 Payment Year 3 $162,495,266.28 Payment Year 4 $110,175,443.79 Payment Year 5 $110,175,443.79 Payment Year 6 $110,175,44 3.79 Year 7 $110,175,443.79 Total: $775,384,615.41 FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 R-5 2. The Common Benefit Fund shall be available to compensate Attorneys engaged in Qualifying Representations of Participating Litigating Subdivisions who: a. have performed work for the common bene fit of all subdivisions pursuant to the guidelines established by Judge Polster set forth in MDL 2804 and the Order dated June 19, 2018, under docket number 636, which is included herein by reference; and b. satisfy the eligibility criteria set forth in Secti on II.G. For purposes of Common Benefit Fund distribution, notwithstanding Section II.A.4 above, Attorneys representing Tribal Nations litigating against the Settling Distributors that have reached a settlement for Released Claims with Settling Distribut ors and/or Released Entities and meet the eligibility criteria in Section II.G shall be eligible. 3. The Common Benefit Fund shall be overseen by the Fee Panel, which shall determine the allocation of funds to eligible Attorneys consistent with this Fee Agre ement and the June 19, 2018 Order. 4. In assessing the benefits that an Attorney has conferred to Participating Subdivisions (including non -Litigating Subdivisions) and/or Tribal Nations for purposes of any compensation decision, the Fee Panel shall give sign ificant weight to the extent to which (i) the Attorney and his or her clients have contributed to increasing (or reducing) the Initial Participation Tier achieved through participation in the Distributor Agreement; (ii) the Attorney and his or her clients have contributed to increasing (or reducing) the amounts achieved under Incentive Payments A -D through participation in the Distributor Agreement; and (iii) the Attorney and his or her clients have contributed to the potential triggering of any suspension, reduction, or offset of Payment amounts under the Distributor Agreement. The Fee Panel may also consider additional fee recoveries the Attorney may potentially obtain, including, but not limited to, from State Back -Stop Agreements, representations of Sta tes or Tribal Nations, representations of other clients in opioids -related matters, or through the representation of Subdivision clients, whether they participated in the Distributor Agreement or not. It is the intent of this provision to recognize that t he goal of the Distributor Agreement is to provide for maximum participation by the Subdivisions, maximum abatement funding for all Subdivisions nationally, and the maximum peace for Released Entities. Therefore, representing a Non - Participating Subdivisi on does not further the goal of the Distributor Agreement and should not be considered Common Benefit because it does not increase funds available to Participating Subdivisions' abatement programs. Representing Later Litigating Subdivisions is antithetica l to the Distributor Agreement, detracts from Common Benefit, and is addressed by the ethics opinion discussed in Section II.I.4. The Fee Panel shall consider this concept of \" common detriment \" set forth in this Section II.C.4 in all of its decisionmaking with respect to the allocation of the Attorney Fee Fund among Attorneys, as well as, in its discretion, any offsets provided to Settling Distributors as set forth in Section II.C.6. The Fee Panel shall consider the totality of the Attorney's Participating Litigating Subdivisions as compared to the Attorney's Non -Participating Litigating FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 R-6 Subdivisions; the Parties recognize that, although the goal is for 100% participation, Attorneys with a higher number of clients have a higher probability of having one or more Non -Participating Litigating Subdivision client. As used in this Section II.C.4 , \"client \" or \" representing \" a Subdivision shall include any Litigating Subdivision as to which the Attorney has a Fee Entitlement. 5. As set forth in Section II.C.6 , the Fe e Panel must consider the factors described in Section II.C.4 to determine how and whether to reduce the amounts to be paid by Settling Distributors under this Fee Agreement and to determine how to allocate funds among Attorneys. They may also, at their di scretion, consider other factors. Any reduction in payment obligation or credit to be given a Settling Distributor in this Fee Agreement shall be applied against Payment Year 7 and working backwards. Any reduction to an Attorney not credited to Settling Distributors shall be allocated to attorneys whose Litigating Subdivision clients participated in the settlement by the Initial Participation Date. 6. The amounts to be provided as a credit or offset to Settling Distributors from the Common Benefit Fund shall depend on the relevant Participation Tier achieved, set forth in Exhibit H of the Distributor Agreement, as follows: a. At Participation Tier 1 or below, the Common Benefit Fund payments to be paid by Settling Distributors shall be reduced as follows: (i) With r espect to any Attorney seeking payment from the Common Benefit Fund, the Fee Panel shall compare the aggregate allocation that Participating Litigating Subdivisions with which the Attorney has a Fee Entitlement would receive using the negotiating class allocation metrics with the aggregate amount that all Litigating Subdivisions (Participating and Non -Participating) with which the Attorney has a Fee Entitlement would receive using the negotiating class allocation metrics, provided that only Litigating Subdi visions in Settling States shall be considered for this ratio. The Fee Panel will multiply the amount to be paid to that Attorney from the Common Benefit Fund by that ratio, reduce the Attorney's award by a maximum reduction of 15%, and the dollar amount of such reduction shall be deducted, dollar -for- dollar, from the amount owed by Settling Distributors to the Common Benefit Fund of the Attorney Fee Fund. (ii) In the event that any Non -Participating Subdivision that is (a) under the jurisdiction of the MDL C ourt or (b) represented by an Attorney that is obligated to pay into the MDL Common Benefit Fund pursuant to a Participation Agreement, an order of the MDL Court, or any other arrangement settles with or wins a judgment against a Released Entity separate f rom the Distributor Agreement, and such settlement or judgment results in a common benefit fee assessment or fee payment into the MDL Common Benefit Fund during the time of Settling Distributors' obligation to pay fees under this Fee Agreement, Settling Di stributors' FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 R-7 obligation to pay into the Common Benefit Fund shall be reduced dollar - for-dollar for any amount of such fee assessments or payments (in the aggregate based on all reductions in this Section II.C.6.a.ii that exceed the reductions in Section II.C.6.a.i ). (iii) For the avoidance of doubt, in Tier 1 for each settlement or judgment with the Settling Distributors that results in an assessment or payment to the MDL Common Benefit Fund, that payment shall result in an offset for the Settling Distributors, un less the assessment or payment occurs after the Payment Date for Year 7. b. At Participation Tier 2, the Common Benefit Fund payments to be made by Settling Distributors shall be reduced only as follows: (i) Reduction by the Fee Panel . With respect to all Attorn eys making an application that seeks payment from the Common Benefit Fund, the Fee Panel shall, following a determination that an Attorney is eligible under Section II.G, apply the criteria specified in Section II.C.4 in determining whether the lack of par ticipation by Subdivisions with which an Attorney has a Fee Entitlement has resulted in a reduction in the Participation Tier achieved, reduction in benefit to Participating Subdivisions as a result of reductions in Incentive Payments A -D, and/or potential triggering of a suspension, reduction or offset under the Distributor Agreement. If the Fee Panel concludes that such a reduction has occurred, it must consider (1) the relative size of the Non - Participating Subdivision, as adjusted by the severity measu res reflected in Exhibit H (governing the Participation Tiers) of the Distributor Agreement, and the impact of its non -participation on the Distributor Agreement as a whole (including amounts of Incentive Payments and triggering of suspensions, reductions or offsets); (2) whether and by how much the payment to the Attorney from the Common Benefit Fund should be reduced as a result of the impact of such non -participation on Participating Subdivisions; and (3) whether some or all of said reduction should reve rt to Settling Distributors due to the reduction in peace obtained from the Distributor Agreement. Consideration of the factors discussed in this Section II.C.6.b.i and Section II.C.4 is mandatory. The decision whether to (and by how much to) reduce paym ents by Settling Distributors or to reduce the payment to any Attorney based on the factors in Section II.C.4 shall be in the sole discretion of the Fee Panel. (ii) Offsets. (1) In the event that any Non -Participating Subdivision that is (a) under the jurisdictio n of the MDL Court or (b) represented by an Attorney that is obligated to pay into the MDL Common Benefit Fund pursuant to a Participation Agreement, an order of the MDL Court, or any other arrangement FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 R-8 settles with or wins a judgment against a Released Ent ity separate from the Distributor Agreement, and such settlement or judgment results in a common benefit fee assessment or fee payment into the MDL Common Benefit Fund during the time of Settling Distributors' obligation to pay Common Benefit Fees under th is Fee Agreement , Settling Distributors' obligation to pay into the Common Benefit Fund shall be reduced dollar -for-dollar up to the amount of the fee assessment or payment, except that such amount shall be capped at 7.5% of the amount of the settlement or judgment. Such reduction shall be taken first from Payment Year 7 of Settling Distributors' payments to the Common Benefit Fund of the Attorney Fee Fund up to the full amount of Settling Distributors' payment obligation in Payment Year 7, then from Payme nt Year 6, and so on. (2) For the avoidance of doubt, for each settlement or judgment with the Settling Distributors that results in an assessment or payment to the MDL Common Benefit Fund, that payment shall result in an offset for the Settling Distributors , unless the assessment or payment occurs after the Payment Date for Payment Year 7. c. At Participation Tier 3, the reductions to the Attorney Fee Fund shall be the same as set forth in Section II.C.6.b , except that the cap on each offset shall be 5% of the amount of such settlement or judgment. d. At Participation Tier 4, there shall be no reductions to the Settling Distributors' obligations to make payment into the Common Benefit Fund, but the principles set forth in Section II.C.4 shall continue to apply. D. Contingency Fee Fund. (40% of the Attorney Fee Fund.) 1. Funds from the Attorney Fee Fund shall be allocated to the Contingency Fee Fund on the following yearly schedule, subject to the adjustments set forth below: Payment Year 1 $54,417,751.48 Payme nt Year 2 $60,373,964.50 Payment Year 3 $108,330,177.52 Payment Year 4 $73,450,295.88 Payment Year 5 $73,450,295.88 Payment Year 6 $73,450,295.88 Payment Year 7 $73,450,295.88 Total: $516,923,077.32 FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 R-9 2. The Contingency Fee Fund shall be available to co mpensate Attorneys engaged in Qualifying Representations of Participating Litigating Subdivisions that meet the criteria set forth in Section II.G. 3. The Contingency Fee Fund shall be available to Attorneys who: a. represent Litigating Subdivisions that are Participating Subdivisions, whether their actions are filed in state or federal court; and b. meet the eligibility criteria of Section II.G. c. Participation in the Contingency Fee Fund by counsel that have a case that is not subject to the jurisdiction of th e MDL Court shall not create, provide, or waive jurisdiction of the MDL Court over that Litigating Subdivision, that case or Attorneys, other than to oversee the fairness of the distribution process, and enforcement of this Fee Agreement. 4. The amounts owed by Settling Distributors to the Contingency Fee Fund shall depend on the relevant Participation Tier set forth in Exhibit H of the Distributor Agreement as follows: a. At Participation Tiers 1, 2 and 3, the Contingency Fee Fund payments shall be reduced as fo llows: (i) For Non -Settling States, the Contingency Fee Fund payments shall first be reduced by the amounts identified by the Fee Panel, pursuant to Section II.H.6 , that would have been owed to counsel for Litigating Subdivisions in Non -Settling States, had th ose States and those Litigating Subdivisions been Settling States and Participating Subdivisions. (ii) Following the calculation in Section II.D.4.a.i , the Contingency Fee Fund payments shall be reduced to reflect the non - joinder of Litigating Subdivisions in S ettling States by subtracting the amounts identified by the Fee Panel, pursuant to Section II.H.6 , that would have been owed to counsel for Non -Participating Litigating Subdivisions in Settling States had such Litigating Subdivisions been Participating Sub divisions. b. At Participation Tier 4, there shall be no reductions in the Contingency Fee Fund. c. In the event that the Settling Distributors, prior to the Effective Date of the Distributor Agreement, settle with any Litigating Subdivision and, under such set tlement agreement pay attorneys' fees, the Fee Panel shall treat those Litigating Subdivisions as Participating Litigating Subdivisions and, applying the same criteria applicable to all Attorneys for Participating Litigating FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 R-10 Subdivisions, determine what am ount they would have been paid from the Contingency Fee Fund if they had become Participating Subdivisions under the Distributor Agreement without such prior settlement. That sum, rather than being paid to the Attorney for the previously settled Litigating Subdivision, shall be credited and/or returned to the Settling Defendants as if determined under Section II.D.4.a.ii above, except that such credit shall not be greater than the amount to the Attorneys paid under the Litigating Subdivision's prior settlem ent agreement. E. Litigating Subdivision Cost Fund. 1. The Settling Distributors shall pay $120,000,000 into the Subdivision Cost Fund, according to the schedule set forth below: Payment Year 1 $40,000,000 Payment Year 2 $40,000,000 Payment Year 3 $40,00 0,000 2. The Litigating Subdivision Cost Fund shall be available to compensate Attorneys for costs and expenses arising out of representation of Participating Litigating Subdivisions or to compensate Participating Litigating Subdivisions for direct in -house costs for expenditures related to their litigation against the Settling Distributors, including the cost of in -house employees. No funds in the Litigating Subdivision Cost Fund may be used to compensate the costs incurred by Non -Participating Subdivisions or Non - Litigating Subdivisions or costs and expenses arising out of representation of any such Subdivision. In allocating the Litigating Subdivision Cost Fund, the Administrator shall not allocate any funds for costs incurred after July 21, 2021. 3. During the period between July 21, 2021, and the Effective Date, the MDL PEC, as well as Litigating Subdivisions eligible to claim costs from the Litigating Subdivision Cost Fund shall make best efforts to cease litigation activity against Settling Distributors, including by jointly seeking stays or severance of claims against the Settling Distributors, where feasible, or postponements if a motion to stay or sever is not feasible or is denied, so long as such actions are not otherwise detrimental to the Litigating Subdivision. 4. In the event that the Settling Distributors, prior to the Effective Date of the Distributor Agreement, settle with any Litigating Subdivision and, under such settlement agreement pay costs to the Litigating Subdivision or its Attorney, the MD L Cost and Expense Fund Administrator shall treat those Litigating Subdivisions as Participating Litigating Subdivisions and, using the same criteria applicable to all applicants to the Subdivision Cost Fund, determine what amount in costs the Litigating S ubdivision or its Attorney would have been paid from the Litigating Subdivision Cost Fund if it had settled under the Distributor Agreement. That sum, rather than being paid to the Attorney or the previously settling Litigating Subdivision, shall be credit ed and/or returned to the Settling Defendants, except that such sum shall not be greater than the amount paid under the previously settled Litigating Subdivision's settlement agreement. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 R-11 5. The MDL Court shall appoint a Cost and Expense Fund Administrat or, who shall develop a process and criteria, with input from participating counsel, by which to (a) determine the distribution of amounts from the MDL Expense Fund in pursuit of the claims against Settling Distributors; and (b) receive and evaluate applic ations from Participating Litigating Subdivisions, whether filed in Federal Court or State Court, to seek reimbursement from the Litigating Subdivision Cost Fund for eligible costs under Section II.E.2 in pursuit of the claims against the Settling Distribu tors. The Cost and Expense Fund Administrator shall require transparency from all applicants as to any other sources for compensating Attorneys for Litigating Subdivisions for costs incurred. The Cost and Expense Fund Administrator shall be compensated fr om the Fund. 6.

No funds may be used to compensate the costs incurred by Non -Participating Subdivisions or to compensate any Attorney for costs incurred in representin g one or more Non -Participating Subdivisions. 3. In allocating the MDL Expense Fund, the Administrator shall not allocate any funds for costs incurred after July 21, 2021, unless the Administrator determines that there are sufficient funds to cover all subdiv ision costs incurred prior to July 21, 2021 and that special circumstances exist to justify costs incurred following the public announcement of the Distributor Agreement. G. Eligibility . 1. It is the intention of all parties participating in the Fee Panel proces s that there should be total transparency to the Fee Panel and to all fund participants. In connection with the process to be developed by the Fee Panel, any and all monies in attorney's fees, including referral fees, expenses paid, promises for payment, o r any other Fee Entitlement, to any applicant in any opioid litigation shall be disclosed to the Fee Panel as a condition of participating in the Attorney Fee Fund and prior to an award from the Fee Panel. Any payment, expectation of payment or perceived entitlement to participate in a State Back -Stop Agreement or any other agreement reached with a FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 R-12 Settling State or any Subdivision or any other source regarding payment of fees must be disclosed to the Fee Panel. Similarly, any right to payment from any ot her fund, for example a fund for payment to lawyers representing Settling States or Tribal Nations or Subdivisions shall be disclosed to the Fee Panel. Because it is anticipated that there will be multiple firms listed on contingent fee agreements with Li tigating Subdivisions, the Fee Panel shall establish procedures, with input from Attorneys for Participating Litigating Subdivisions, for who should petition for fees from such groups and to whom the fee shall be paid and thereafter distributed to co -couns el in accordance with applicable agreements. For the avoidance of doubt, all Attorneys that are part of such groups must meet the eligibility criteria in Section II.G , must be subject to the criteria set forth in Section II.C.4 , and must be disclosed to t he Fee Panel. 2. An Attorney may apply for and recover attorneys' fees from the Common Benefit Fund, the Contingency Fee Fund, and the Litigating Subdivision Cost Fund and any fund created by a past or future State Back -Stop Agreement, provided the Attorney satisfies the requirements relevant to each such fund and requirements for disclosure to the Fee Panel. 3. An Attorney may not receive any payment from the Attorney Fee Fund (which includes both the Contingency Fee Fund and the Common Benefit Fund) unless the following eligibility criteria are met and annually certified by the Attorney: a. The Attorney must expressly waive the enforcement against the Litigating Subdivision client of all Fee Entitlements (other than under State Back - Stop Agreements) arising out of or related to any or all Qualifying Representations of any Participating Litigating Subdivision prior to applying for attorneys' fees from the Attorney Fee Fund or costs from the Cost Funds. All applications for attorneys' fees or costs under this Fee Agreement shall include an affirmation by the Attorney of such waiver and notice to the client(s) of such waiver. Such waiver shall not preclude the Attorney from submitting such Fee Entitlements to the Fee Panel as a factor for consideration in allocatin g payments from the Attorney Fee Fund or in connection with a State Back -Stop Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no Attorney may recover fees under this Fee Agreement unless the Attorney expressly agrees not to enforce Fee Entitlements as to each and every Participating Litigating Subdivision represented by that Attorney, but such Attorneys may participate in and receive funds from a State Back -Stop Agreement. b. The Attorney must represent that s/he has no present intent to represent or participate in t he representation of any Later Litigating Subdivision or any Releasor with respect to Released Claims against Released Entities. c. The Attorney must represent that s/he has not and will not engage in any advertising or solicitation related to Released Clai ms against Released Entities where such advertising or solicitation relates to a representation that the Attorney could not undertake consistent with the ethics opinion referenced in Section II.I.4 . FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 R-13 d. The Attorney must represent s/he will not charge or acce pt any referral fees for any Released Claims brought against Released Entities by Later Litigating Subdivisions. For the avoidance of doubt, this representation shall not prohibit Attorneys from receiving allocated shares of any future common benefit assessments arising out of settlements or judgments with Later Litigating Subdivisions represented by other Attorneys that are the result of the MDL Court's Common Benefit order. e. The Attorney may not have and must represent that s/he does not have a Fee Enti tlement related to a Later Litigating Subdivision. f. The Attorney must certify that s/he has reviewed the ethics opinion referenced in Section II.I.4 and will act in conformity with such opinion. g. The Attorney must fully disclose the participation, or the anticipation of participation, in any agreement with a Settling State or Participating Subdivision concerning fees arising out of or related to the Distributor Agreement, including any fees paid or anticipated to be paid or any State Back -Stop Agreement. h. The Attorney must identify for the Fee Panel whether s/he utilized state litigation work product or MDL work product, including but not limited to ARCOS data, document repositories, experts developed in the MDL, and deposition transcripts. The Attorney must identify whether s/he signed the MDL Participation Agreement, and for which case(s) it was signed. i. Any Attorney who applies for fees from one or both Funds must represent that, having exercised his/her independent judgment, s/he believes the Distributor A greement to be fair and will make or has made best efforts to recommend the Distributor Agreement to his or her Subdivision clients in Settling States. For the avoidance of doubt, each Attorney is expected to exercise his or her independent judgment in th e best interest of each client individually before determining whether to recommend joining the settlement. All applications for attorneys' fees or costs under this Section II shall include an affirmation by the Attorney in compliance with this Section II .G. 4. No Attorney receiving fees under this Fee Agreement may apply for or recover from the Attorney Fee Fund fees arising from representing a Non -Settling State or a Non -Participating Subdivision. All applications for attorneys' fees under this Section II shall include an affirmation by the Attorney of compliance with this Section II. 5. An Attorney who has filed an application under this Section II and received an award of attorneys' fees shall provide a certification of compliance this Fee Agreement annuall y during the years upon which they are still entitled to receive attorneys' fee payments. 6. If, at any time, the Attorney is unable to make the representations set forth in this Section II.G.3 , such representations become untrue, or the Attorney falsely FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 R-14 represents compliance with the eligibility criteria, the Attorney shall cease to be eligible to receive funds from the Attorney Fee Fund until further review by the Fee Panel of the Attorney's eligibility under and compliance with this Section II. 7. If an Atto rney has a Fee Entitlement from a Later Litigating Subdivision or otherwise becomes unable to reaffirm compliance with the eligibility criteria set forth above, the Attorney shall notify Settling Distributors and the Fee Panel. For the avoidance of doubt, any Attorney who undertakes any new representation of, or has a Fee Entitlement to, a Later Litigating Subdivision shall be prohibited from receiving any future funds from the Attorney Fee Fund. If an Attorney fails to notify Settling Distributors and th e Fee Panel of such Fee Entitlement to a Later Litigating Subdivision, the Attorney shall be required to refund amounts previously paid. 8. In the event that an Attorney is deemed ineligible by the Fee Panel (whether based on its initial application or subs equent recertification), the Fee Panel shall provide notice to the Attorney and give the Attorney 30 days to provide additional information such that the Fee Panel could reconsider the Attorney's eligibility. 9. To the extent that an Attorney has a Fee Entit lement with a Participating Subdivision and is authorized to bring Released Claims against Released Entities, but such authorization is, in scope, less broad than the category of Released Claims set forth in the Distributor Agreement, such Attorney may par ticipate fully in both the Contingency Fee Fund and the Common Benefit Fund, without any reduction imposed by the Fee Panel due to the scope of the authorization, so long as the Participating Subdivision fully releases all Released Claims against Released Entities. 10. Attorneys applying to the Attorney Fee Fund knowingly and expressly agree to be bound by the decisions of the Fee Panel, subject to the limited appeal rights set forth in this Fee Agreement, and waive the ability to assert the lack of enforceabi lity of the allocation reached through the arbitration procedures outlined herein. H. Calculation of Amounts Due . 1. The Fee Panel shall be solely responsible for determining the amount of fees to be paid to each Attorney and each Participating Subdivision that applies under this Section II . None of the Released Entities shall have any responsibility, obligation, or liability of any kind whatsoever with respect to how attorneys' fees are calculated under this Section II , except that the Fee Panel may receive in formation from the Settling Distributors (a) as to the identity of Participating, Non -Participating, Litigating, Later Litigating, and Non -Litigating Subdivisions; (b) the impact of non -participation by a Litigating Subdivision as is relevant to the Fee Pa nel's determination in Section II.C.4 ; and (c) such other information as Settling Distributors may voluntarily elect to provide. 2. The Fee Panel shall establish procedures for the arbitration process consistent with this Fee Agreement and orders of the MDL C ourt. Such procedures may include submission of documentary and/or other evidence, interviews with applicants and/or other counsel (including counsel for Settling Distributors) that the Fee Panel FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 R-15 deems appropriate, and/or other means of creating a record upon which fee awards will be based. 3. In making determinations under this Fee Agreement, the Fee Panel must apply the eligibility criteria set forth in Section II.G of this Fee Agreement and the criteria set forth in Section II. In addition, the Fee Pa nel will give consideration in regard to Common Benefit awards to the Johnson factors, as well as the following factors (which factors may be applied and given relative weight in the Fee Panel's discretion): a. The Attorney's contemporaneously recorded time and labor dedicated to Qualifying Representations along with the Attorney's financial commitment to such Qualifying Representations. Claimed \" time\" will not be automatically accepted by the Fee Panel but will be critically reviewed and given substantially more weight and consideration if such time was subject to the audit process described in any Pretrial Order(s) governing the collection of common benefit time; b. The novelty, time, and complexity of the Qualifying Representations; c. The skill requisite to per form legal services properly and undesirability of the case; d. The preclusion of other employment by the Attorney due to time dedicated to Qualifying Representations; e. The \" common benefit ,\" if any alleged to have been conferred by the Attorney and whether su ch common benefit work product by that Attorney was used by others in parallel litigations against Released Entities whether within or outside the MDL, provided that for any Attorney claiming that s/he substantially benefited cases other than those in whic h s/he entered an appearance as counsel must substantiate such claims by proffering factual support, such as proper supporting affidavits or other documents as determined by the Fee Panel with input from Attorneys for Participating Litigating Subdivisions; f. Any \" common detriment ,\" as set forth in Section II.C.4 . g. Any contingent fee agreements or other Fee Entitlement with Participating Subdivisions, enforcement of which, except for State Back -Stop Agreements, are waived in conjunction with the application, t he nature and extent of any work for those Participating Subdivisions, whether such Participating Subdivisions actively litigated and, if so, the nature and procedural history of such case(s); h. The experience, reputation, and ability of the Attorney; i. Whet her the Attorney's clients brought Released Claims against Released Entities; FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 R-16 j. The status of discovery in cases primarily handled by the Attorney; k. The nature of any work by the Attorney on \" bellwether \" cases or cases that were similarly active in litigatio n; l. Any pressure points successfully asserted by the Attorney in cases against Settling Distributors or any risk for Settling Distributors created by the Attorney in cases against them; m. Any risk for defendants created by applicants in cases against the Setting Distributors; n. Successful and unsuccessful motion practice in cases worked on by the Attorney; o. The date of filing of any cases filed by the Attorney; p. Obtaining consolidation of the litigation in the Attorney's jurisdiction; q. The number and population of entities represented by the Attorney and the fees that would have been awarded under extinguished contingent fee arrangements; r. Whether the Attorney's clients brought claims against the Settling Distributors; s. Whether the Attorney has had a leadership ro le in the litigation, whether in state or federal court; t. Whether the Attorney has had a leadership role in any negotiations aimed at resolving the litigation; u. Whether the Attorney's cases have survived motions to dismiss; v. The extent to which the Attorne y contributed to the work product user for the common benefits of opioids litigants, including, without limitation, work on ARCOS data, Prescription Data Monitoring Programs, IQVIA data, depositions, document production and analysis experts, motions, brief s and pleadings, trial preparations, and trials; w. The extent to which litigation was done prior to and contributed to completion of settlement negotiations, as distinct from litigation that was done litigating after the announcement of the Distributor Agre ement, such latter litigation both being of less value and potentially resulting a common detriment to the settlement process; and FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 R-17 x. Any other factors that the Fee Panel finds to be appropriate to consider after input from applicants to the Attorney Fee Fun d. 4. The Fee Panel shall develop procedures for receiving a single application, which may be updated or amended based on new information (such as participation by additional Litigating Subdivisions) from each Attorney seeking compensation from the Attorney F ee Fund, procedures shall not be inconsistent with this Fee Agreement. Any request for attorneys' fees not included on the single application or through the updating/amendment process designed by the Fee Panel shall be deemed waived. For purposes of tra nsparency and to permit the Fee Panel to conduct its work, the application from each Attorney shall, at a minimum, require each Attorney to: a. Identify all Litigating Subdivisions for which s/he is seeking payment from the Attorney Fee Fund; b. Identify all Su bdivisions in both Settling and Non -Settling States with respect to which s/he has a Fee Entitlement with respect to Relevant Claims against Released Entities, and identify all co -counsel in such cases; c. Identify which of those Subdivisions are Participatin g Subdivisions and which are not; d. Specify the specific fund or funds within the Attorney Fee Fund from which the Attorney is seeking compensation; e. Demonstrate his or her eligibility for compensation from the relevant sub funds within the Attorney Fee Fund pursuant to the criteria set forth for the relevant sub fund; and f. Identify any and all Fee Entitlements from representations of States, Tribal Nations, or other plaintiffs related to Released Claims against Released Entities or in opioids -related matters. Notwithstanding Sections II.H.4.a -f above, the Panel may consider a supplemental application if the Attorney shows good cause why circumstances exist that will lead to consideration for additional Common Benefit award. Examples would include, but are not limited to, an Attorney having Non -Participating Litigating Subdivision clients that subsequently become Participating Subdivisions, a Bar Date passes that increases participation or the Participation Tier or an Allocation Agreement is reached. 5. With res pect to the Common Benefit Fund, the Fee Panel shall (subject to any applicable MDL Court Order): a. Review the applications of all Attorneys seeking compensation from the Common Benefit Fund, including determining eligibility for each Attorney as set forth i n Section II.G . FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 R-18 b. Reduce, on an annual basis, the Distributor's payment obligations, as set forth in Section II.C.6 . The Panel shall inform the Settling Distributors and the MDL PEC of all such amounts and adjust the Settling Distributors' payment obligatio ns accordingly. c. Using criteria set forth in Sections II.C and II.G, allocate amounts from the Common Benefit Fund to eligible Attorneys, including payment amounts for each Payment Year. In making such allocations (regardless of the Participation Tier achi eved), the Panel shall apply the principles set forth in Section II.C.4 and shall allocate any reduction in the payments of Settling Distributors specified in Section II.C.6 to the amounts paid to Attorneys with a Fee Entitlement to Litigating Subdivisions that are not Participating Subdivisions. 6. With respect to the Contingency Fee Fund, the Fee Panel shall: a. Review the applications of all Attorneys seeking compensation from the Litigating Subdivision Fee Fund, including determining eligibility for each Att orney as set forth in Section II.G . b. Apply the Mathematical Model in Exhibit A . c. Use such allocations to reduce payments, on an annual basis, the payment obligations of the Settling Distributors to the Attorney Fee Fund as set forth in Section II.D.4 , and d istributions therefrom, and inform the Settling Distributors and MDL PEC of all such adjustments. 7. To the extent that there is a dispute about the calculations of the Fee Panel related to the amounts that Settling Distributors are required to pay (including application of any reductions or offsets under this Fee Agreement), such disputes shall be presented to the Fee Panel and any disputed funds be paid into/held in escrow. The Fee Panel shall resolve such disputes expeditiously, with either Party having th e right to seek review from the MDL Court. 8. For purposes of determination of fee or cost awards, allocations, reductions and possible reversions under this Fee Agreement, unless specified otherwise a Subdivision will be considered a Non -Participating Subdiv ision if it is not a Participating Subdivision as of the deadline for the application for the fee or cost award at issue (or, if the determination does not involve a specific application, the date on which the record for such determination closes). 9. In the event that the Fee Panel, through the use of the Mathematical Model set forth in Exhibit A, allocates funds from the Contingency Fee Fund for an Attorney based on a Qualifying Representation of a Participating Litigating Subdivision or allocates cost to su ch Participating Litigating Subdivision and that Subdivision is in a Settling State in which the Consent Judgment has not been approved, such funds shall be placed into escrow until the Consent Judgment is approved, after which time they shall be released. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 R-19 I. Miscellaneous . 1. The costs associated with the Fee Panel prior to the Effective Date of this Fee Agreement shall be funded by Settling Distributors. The Fee Panel shall charge an hourly rate that has been previously approved by a federal or state court and shall provide a budget and a cap for such work prior to the Effective Date, which shall be approved by Settling Distributors and such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Settling Distributors shall receive a refund for any such payment of pre -Effective Date costs from interest that accrues on the monies in the Attorney Fee Fund (including interest that accrues during such time as the Attorney Fee Fund monies are in escrow prior to the Effective Date of the Distributor Agreement), up to the amo unt of such costs. Post - Effective Date, the cost of the Fee Panel shall be charged against the applicable Fee Fund based on allocation by the Fee Panel and shall not be otherwise funded by Settling Distributors. The costs associated with the Cost and Exp ense Fund Administrator shall be paid from funds in the MDL Expense Fund and the Litigating Subdivision Cost Fund and shall not be otherwise funded by Settling Distributors. 2. The MDL PEC will seek, and the Attorneys General for Settling States and the S ettling Distributors will not oppose, a Common Benefit Fee Order requiring an assessment of 7.5% on the gross recovery (by judgment or settlement) of any Non - Participating Subdivision that is subject to the federal court jurisdiction, represented by a MDL PEC firm, represented by any Attorney receiving fees from the Common Benefit Fund, represented by any Attorney that signed a Participation Agreement or paid in a case otherwise under the jurisdiction of the MDL Court. 3. The MDL PEC shall provide to Settling Distributors information they have that identifies Attorneys who represent Litigating Subdivisions who are not Participating Subdivisions and who have an obligation to pay a common benefit assessment, either due to the MDL Court's orders or to having sign ed a Participation Agreement. 4. The MDL PEC shall retain ethics counsel of its choice to provide an opinion that addresses the compliance of its ethical obligations, as it relates to the Distributor Agreement. Such opinion shall address the issue of the pot ential conflict of interest for an Attorney that had represented a Participating Subdivision also representing a Later Litigating Subdivision as defined in the Distributor Agreement. This Section II.I shall be enforceable to the extent permitted by the eq uivalent to Rules 1.16 and 5.6 of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct in the relevant jurisdictions. The opinion shall be provided to the Settling Distributors as soon as it is completed and, in any event, prior to July 31, 2021 and shall be disse minated to counsel eligible to apply to the Attorney Fee Fund within 30 days of the announcement of the Distributor Agreement. The MDL PEC represents that it will comply with this opinion until the Reference Date and thereafter if the Distributor Agreemen t proceeds. The cost of such expert work done prior to the Effective Date of the Distributor Agreement shall be funded by Settling Distributors. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 R-20 5. Participating Subdivisions agree to instruct their counsel to treat information, work product and expert materials as secret under Rule 1.6 of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct. Accordingly, an Attorney shall not share information or work product with, or experts or materials to, non -participants (other than the Attorney's own current clients or th eir lawyers, consultants, experts or other representatives or agents). However, nothing herein shall prevent MDL Leadership or PEC Counsel from fulfilling their obligations in any MDL and the MDL Court Order. III. Miscellaneous. A. Termination. If the Distributo r Agreement does not proceed past the Reference Date, whether because the Settling Distributors do not determine to proceed or for any other reason, this Fee Agreement shall be null and void, Settling Distributors shall have no obligation to make any payme nts under this Fee Agreement, and the Settling Distributors and the MDL PEC shall take such steps as are necessary to restore the status quo ante. B. MDL Court Consideration. This Fee Agreement shall be attached as an exhibit to the Distributor Agreement. Th is Fee Agreement shall also be submitted jointly by the Settling Distributors and the MDL PEC to the MDL Court for approval pursuant to the motion that shall be attached, prior to the Preliminary Agreement Date of the Distributor Agreement, to this Fee Agreement as Exhibit B . 1. In the event that the MDL Court, through an order, makes any change to the amounts potentially to be paid by Settling Distributors under this Fee Agreement, makes any change to the Fee Panel's consideration of the factors set forth in Section II.C.4 , or any other material change to the draft Order attached as part of Exhibit B or the terms of this Fee Agreement, the Settling Distributors and the MDL PEC shall meet and confer concerning such changes. 2. If the Settling Distributors and th e MDL PEC are unable to reach agreement and revisions to this Fee Agreement in the event discussed in Section III.B.1 , this Fee Agreement shall be null and void, Settling Distributors shall have no obligation to make any payments under this Fee Agreement, and the Settling Distributors and the MDL PEC shall take such steps as are necessary to restore the status quo ante . C. Amendment. Once the MDL Court has entered an order implementing this Fee Agreement, this Fee Agreement can only be amended by (1) writte n agreement of the Settling Distributors and the MDL PEC and (2) approval by the MDL Court. D. Jurisdiction and Enforcement. The MDL Court shall have exclusive and ongoing jurisdiction over the enforcement and implementation of this Fee Agreement as set fort h herein. The MDL PEC shall be the Authorized Party to enforce this Fee Agreement, as to the payment obligations of the Settling Distributors as set forth in this Fee Agreement, and as to Attorneys making application to the Funds under this Fee Agreement. Solely for purposes of assessing or allocating common benefit fees, the MDL Court will continue to have jurisdiction over the work product developed in the MDL Court by and under the direction of the MDL PEC with respect to claims against the Settling De fendants, including data and documents, depositions, expert FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 R-21 reports, briefs and pleadings; and the MDL Court's protective orders, management orders, and other decisions regarding such discovery and other work product, including but not limited to, conditio ns on its use, will continue in full force and effect. Nothing in this Section III.D authorizes the MDL Court to act contrary to this Fee Agreement or to share any of the work product, or provides the MDL Court with jurisdiction over the Distributor Agree ment. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 R-22 Description of Mathematical Model for the Allocation of the Contingency Fee Funds Distributor Settlement Agreement and Janssen Settlement Agreement This document describes the Mathematical Model for allocation of the Contingency Fee Fund described in Exhibit R (Agreement of Attorney's Fees, Expenses and Costs) to the Distributor Settlement Agreement and the Janssen Settlement Agreement, respectively.19 Awards of fees from the Contingency Fee Funds shall be available to Attorneys with Qualifying Rep resentations of Participating Litigating Subdivisions eligible to receive an allocation under the corresponding agreements.20 A Fee Panel shall oversee the application of the Model and resolve any questions or disputes concerning the eligibility of a couns el to participate. The Panel is empowered to hear disputes concerning and ensure the accuracy of the mathematical calculations. In general terms, allocation of the Contingency Fee Fund shall be made by (1) determining the amount of the Settlement Fund tha t is attributable to each Litigating Subdivision; (2) making certain adjustments to these amounts based on when the Subdivision filed suit and the terms of the applicable fee contract; and (3) dividing the Contingency Fee Fund proportionately among counsel for each Participating Litigating Subdivision based on the amounts calculated in subpart 2. Each Settling Defendant is responsible only for its own share of payments.21 In other words, to collect a fee award from the Contingency Fee Fund against a Settl ing Defendant, the Participating Litigating Subdivision must have named the Settling Defendant in its lawsuit. The total amount of the Contingency Fee Fund in the Distributor Settlement Agreement is $516,923,077.22 Amerisource's share is is $196,947,692.46 (38.1%). The total amount of the Contingency Fee Fund in the Janssen Settlement Agreement is $123,076,923.23 More specifically, allocation of each Settling Defenda nt's share of the corresponding Contingency Fee Fund shall be made according to the following steps. These steps must be performed separately for each Settlement Agreement, and each Defendant is responsible for paying only its share of the Contingency Fee Fund. These calculations are made only for purpose of determining the percentage share of the Contingency Fee Fund that Attorneys for each Participating Litigating Subdivision should receive, not for determining the dollar amount each Subdivision will re ceive. 19 See Distributor Settlement Agreement , Exhibit R \u00a7 II.B .3; Janssen Settlement Agreement , Exhibit R \u00a7 II. B.3. 20 Distributor Settlement Agreement , Exhibit R \u00a7 II.B .3; Janssen Settlement Agreement , Exhibit R \u00a7 II. B.3 21 Distributor Settlement Ag reement , Exhibit R \u00a7 II. A.5. 22 Distributor Settlement Agreement , Exhibit R \u00a7 II. D.1. 23 Janssen Settlement Agreement , Exhibit R \u00a7 II.D.1. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 R-23 (1) For each Settling State, attribute 50% of the settlement funds for that State to its Subdivisions according to the Subdivision Allocation Percentage in Exhibit G to the Distributor Settlement Agreement or Janssen Settlement Agreement, as appropriate . Illustrative example for the Distributor Agreement: Assume that State A is allocated 1.00000% of the $18,554,013,691.11 Restitution/Abatement amount [see Exhibit M of the Agreement]. 50% of the 1% share allocated to State A is $92,770,068.46. Assume tha t, per Exhibit G of the Agreement, the Subdivision Allocation Percentage for City B in State A is 1.00000000%. For purposes of determining its counsel's share of the Contingency Fee Fund, City B is attributed 1.00000000% of $92,770,068.46, or $927,700.68. (2) Adjust the amounts in paragraph 1 as follows: a. Upward Adjustment for Early Filers. Increase the amount calculated in paragraph 1 above by 10% for any Litigating Subdivision that named the defendant(s) in a suit before December 5, 2017, the date the Nation al Prescription Opiate Litigation MDL was formed. This adjustment must be done individually for each defendant. If the Litigating Subdivision did not name a Settling Defendant in a suit before January 1, 2021, then fees from the Contingency Fee Fund for that defendant will not be awarded to Attorneys with otherwise Qualifying Representations of that Participating Litigating Subdivision. Illustrative Example: Assume City C is attributed $1,000,000 under paragraph 1 above. If City C named the defendant(s) b efore 12/5/2017, the attributed amount would be adjusted to $1,100,000. b. Determine Amount Due under Contingency Fee Contract . Determine the amount that would be due to Attorneys with Qualifying Representations of each Participating Litigating Subdivision under the terms of the applicable fee contract if the Participating Litigating Subdivision were to receive the amount calculated in paragraph 2.a. This amount can be referred to as the Contingency Fee Assumption. Illustrative Example: Continuing the examp le given in paragraph 2.a, if Attorneys have a 20% contingency fee contract with City C for the relevant litigation, the amount calculated in this step would be 20% of $1,100,000, or $220,000. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 R-24 In the next step, the Contingency Fee Assumption is used to det ermine the percentage share of the Contingency Fee Fund due to Attorneys for each Participating Litigating Subdivision. (3) Divide the Contingency Fee Fund proportionately among Attorneys for each Participating Litigating Subdivision in two ways: a. National Fee Pool Calculation. Determine each Litigating Subdivision's percentage share of all amounts due under contingency fee contracts nationwide by dividing the Contingency Fee Assumption calculated for each Subdivision in paragraph 2.b by the sum of all Continge ncy Fee Assumptions. Then multiply that percentage by the Contingency Fee Fund to figure each Subdivision's dollar share of the Contingency Fee Fund (but only for Settling Defendants the Subdivision timely named in a lawsuit).24 Illustrative example 0.012222% * $516,923,077.32 [Contingency Fee Fund] = $63,179.49 b. Separate State Fee Pools Calculation. Determine each Litigating Subdivision's percentage share of all amounts due under contingency fee contracts statewide by dividing the Contingency Fee Assumption calculated for each Subdivision in paragraph 2.b by the sum of all Contingency Fee Assumptions i n the same State. Then multiply that percentage by the portion of the Contingency Fee Fund that corresponds to that State's Overall Allocation Percentage, shown in Exhibit F of the relevant Settlement Agreement, to figure each Subdivision's dollar share o f the Contingency Fee Fund (but only for Settling Defendants the Subdivision timely named in a lawsuit). Illustrative example for Distributor Settlement Agreement: 1% * $516,923,077.32 = $5,169,230.77 [amount of the Contingency Fee Fund corresponding to St ate A] 24 Because a few Litigating Subdivisions named only one or two of the Distributors in a lawsuit before January 1, 2021, each Subdivision's share of the Contingency Fee Fund is slightly different for each distributor . Therefore, under the Distributor Settlement Agreement , the calculation s described in this step need to be made separately for each Settling Defendant. It is shown in a single calculation here for ease of illustration only. 25 In this example, $ 1.8 billion is the amount theoretically owed under all contingency fee contracts for litigation against distributors as calculated in paragraph 2.b . This amount is illus trative only; the actual amount will not be known until all litigating subdivisions are identified and the terms of all of their contingency fee contracts are collected. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 R-25 Assume a total of $17,600,000 is owed under contingency fee contracts for State $64,615.38 The award of fees to Attorneys with Qualifying Representations of Participating Li tigating Subdivisions will be the average of the final amounts calculated in paragraphs 3.a and 3.b above.26 Paragraph 3.a represents allocation based on a proportional share of a National Fee Pool, while paragraph 3.b represents allocation based on a pro portional share of the Separate State Fee Pools. In other words, for the National Fee Pool described above in paragraph 3.a, the contingency fee contract rate is compared to all other contingency fee contract rates in the nation. For the Separate State F ee Pools described above in paragraph 3.b, the contingency fee contract terms are compared to the other contingency fee contract terms in that same State. The National Fee Pool and the Separate State Fee Pools are given equal weighting. This is illustrat ed below. Using the first methodology, Attorneys for two Subdivisions in different States with the same amount calculated under paragraph 2.b would be assigned the same amount under paragraph 3.a. Using the second methodology, Attorneys for the same two Subdivisions would be assigned different amounts under paragraph 3.b because they are in different States. Specifically, the Subdivision in the State with a smaller proportion of Participating 26 The model also enforces a maximum fee award of 20% of the amount calculated in 2. b. This rule is designed to prevent windfalls by addressing over -allocation in a small number of states with relatively few Litigating Subdivisions. An estimated 97% of Qualifying Representations are not impacted this rule. The description in this documen t of the Mathematical Model is by necessity an abstraction; the precise contours of the calculations are defined in the model itself. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 R-2 Litigating Subdivisions would be allocated more than the Subd ivision in the State with a greater proportion of Participating Litigating Subdivisions. FINAL AGREEMENT 3.25.22 S-1 EXHIBIT S Agreement on the State Outside Counsel Fee Fund 1. Creation of a State Outside Counsel Fee Fund. The Settling Distributors and the Settling States agree to the crea tion of a state outside counsel fee fund to pay reasonable attorneys' fees of Settling States which have retained outside counsel in connection with litigation against the Settling Distributors (such fund, the \" State Outside Counsel Fee Fund \"). 2. State Outs ide Counsel Fee Fund Administration. The State Outside Counsel Fee Fund shall be administered separately from the Common Benefit Fund, the Contingency Fee Fund, the State Cost Fund, and the MDL Expense Fund. A committee of Attorneys G eneral shall oversee the State Outside Counsel Fee Fund (the \" Fee Fund Committee \"). The Fee Fund Committee shall initially consist of the following States: (a) Delaware; (b) Florida; (c) Georgia; (d) Indiana; (e) Michigan; (f) Ohio; and (g) Rhode Island.

If a Settling State's outside c ounsel does not agree that the amount calculated in Paragraph 5 above either satisfies in full or exceeds the amounts owed by the Settling State, then the Settling State's share shall be placed in an interest - bearing escrow account (less reasonable expense s of the Fee Fund Administrator) and held unless and until the Settling State and its outside counsel agree in a signed writing to a resolution of the amount outstanding or there is a final judgment entered that is no longer appealable. c. Upon being provid ed a signed, written agreement or the final non -appealable judgment, the Fee Fund Administrator shall release monies from the State Outside Counsel Fee Fund in either the amount held by the Fee Fund Administrator, if the amount of the agreement or judgment is equal to or more than the amount held, or the amount indicated in the agreement or in the final judgment, if the amount in the agreement or judgment is less than the amount held. d.

In the event the amount due to the Settling State's outside counsel from an escrow account is less than the total amount of funds escrowed on the account of the Settling State, the balance shall be paid to the Settling S tate.
