If you have a headache, take an aspirin. Can't sleep? Take Ambien,\" says Close.

A family farm in Mendocino, California, that has never used pesticides on the land. Even notorious multi-tasker Martha Stewart is a fan. \"One of things I was so moved by was when I opened the spa, she wandered in and then wrote an article,\" Close recalls. \"I got letters from people in Alabama or Arkansas talking about how their grandma used to rub their backs with herbal remedies,\" she says. \"The kitchen used to be the apothecary.
