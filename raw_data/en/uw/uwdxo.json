In addition, she has served on the faculties of Columbia University School of Social Work, the State University of New York at Stony Brook's Department of Child Welfare, and Mercy College Department of Psychology. Now a New Yorker, Monique Lang was born in France, grew up in Central America, and has lived in many different states and countries. \"Although moving around was difficult at the time,\" she says, \"it allowed me to experience different cultures, ethnic backgrounds, and spiritual orientations. This understanding is helpful in my work with my clients as it enables me to understand and put into context each person's particular background and way of viewing the world.\" Today we will be discussing her latest book, Meditations and Ceremonies for Healing: Handbook for Personal Growth and Wellness, published in 2019.
