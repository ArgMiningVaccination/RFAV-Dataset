RWJ Hamilton Grounds for Healing Throughout history, people have cultivated gardens, knowing them instinctively as places that hold restorative powers. Recent research concludes that patients in healthcare facilities who have natural views have shorter post-operative stays, experience fewer post-operative stays, experience fewer post-operative complications and take less pain medication. Such evidence led RWJ Hamilton to build areas throughout its campus that offer visitors a natural, soothing environment. A partnership with Grounds For Sculpture, a public sculpture park based in Hamilton, NJ, has led to the creation of four beautiful, distinct Grounds For Healing on our campus. Integrative Therapy Advisory Committee The Integrative Therapy Advisory Committee is an interdisciplinary group of physicians and other healthcare providers who guide the selection of the holistic therapies, classes and events that we offer to the community using evidence-based practice (EBP). EBP examines the effectiveness of holistic approaches using recent research, clinical observations and patients' reports.
