On a daily basis our bodies are bombarded with toxins and constantly removing these toxins. However, the body can sometimes be overburdened with the toxins from environmental exposure, poor diet, etc. Sometimes the toxic burden comes from a genetic makeup that has impaired or weakness in certain detoxification pathways. In either case this creates a build up of toxins in our bodies. The build up can further impair detoxification systms. In some cases overburdened toxic exposure can be the sole reason for chronic health issues like headaches, poor concentration, mood issues, cardiovasuclar issues and more. The goal of the any detox diet program should be to focus on the bodies ability to remove these toxins. This is done by removing exposures from diet and environment and stimulating and enhancing the organs of elimination. One of the positive side effects of a detox diet program is weight loss. Our detox diet program does not restrict calories, however, most people will lose a significant amount of weight. This 3 week program will focus on all the major organs of elimination and get your body back to a healthy state. "}
