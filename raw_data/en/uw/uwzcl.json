Projects which are included are: i) those describing research on verocytotoxin -producing E. coli (VTEC) which commenced over the period 2004 -2008 and ii) projects describing research into other enterovirulent E. coli which started during 2000 - 2008. The report describes a total of 85 project s which fall broadly into two categories; those investigating the basic fundamental research into bacterial physiology and pathogenicity, and those with an applied research focus. Many of the fundamental research projects have a molecular biology element which reflects the availability of E. coli genome sequences , while the applied projects focus largely on VTEC and the detection, reduction and elimination of the organism from cattle and the fo od supply chain. Enterovirulent strains of E. coli cause gastrointestinal diseases in humans . The type of enterovirulent disease caused by a particular strain of E. coli depends on the distribution and expression of virulence factors . Several clinical syn dromes accompany infection with enterovirulent E. coli and include different types and duration of diarrhoea (e.g. persistent, watery) and also a range of side effects including vomiting, pyrexia and abdominal cramps. VTEC infections are rarer , but can lead to h aemorrhagic colitis and/or haemolytic -uremic syndrome which can be fatal. VTEC is also sometimes known as enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) or shiga toxin producing E. coli (STEC). Infected humans and carriers are the main source of most enterovirulent E. coli infections. The key reservoir for VTEC is the gastrointestinal tract in healthy farm cattle . A number o f potential routes of infection arise from a cattle reservoir, including contamination at various stages of the food production chain, from the farm, to abattoir to food production and the kitchen . The environment where infected animals are maintained has also been identified as a source of VTEC infection. Significant advances achieved through research A significant number of projec ts have invest igated the pathogenicity of E. coli at the molecular biology level. Greater insights into gene function, the MSFFG Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 3 identification of additional putative virulence factors, and comparative genome studies have all been possible due to the a vailabili ty of genome sequences. The information gained from those projects which describe research into VTEC in the context of the human food -supply chain appears to have consolidated earlier information regarding key contamination sources and ways of reducing levels of VTEC in farm animals . Mathematical models are also described which simulate VTEC transmission. The data available from projects ha ve been used to produce strategies to reduce the risk of contamination from the farm an imal and in the food processi ng industry. Outstanding issues This report highlights gaps which , if addressed with additional research , would add to the current knowledge of enterovirulent E. coli in relation to the microbiology of food. There are less molecular biology data genera ted from in vivo models of the host (cattle):human (or human model) system than there are in vitro data sets. If such data w ere available it could both help validate the in vitro models and lead to a greater understanding of the relationship between the pathogen and host1. In relation to transmission and colonisation t here is a need for a better under standing of the conditions needed for successful transfer of VTEC f rom animals to man , including the risk of VTEC infections from non-food source s and what preventative strategies, if any, are recommended. The risk of transfer of the virulence determinants from VTEC to other organisms was highlighted in the previous VTEC report and remains a gap. Overall the projects des cribed i n this report provide data and information both of the fundamental biology of enterovirulent E. coli, and the presence and control of VTEC in the food chain in the context of human health. There remains a need to bring together both of these ar eas of resea rch to ensure that information on pathogenicity c an be applied to further current understanding of the relationship between host and pathogen. 1 In the 2001 Nature paper on Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 the authors suggested that \"...... showing that disease -related traits are associated with predicted genes will require many areas of study including extensive testing in animal models that mimic symptoms of human infections .....\" (Perna et al , 2001). MSFFG Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 4 LAY SUMMARY Escherichia coli are commonly known as E. coli and are bacteri a which live in the digestive tract (the stomach and intestines ) of humans and animals. While most E. coli are harmless , there are a number which can infect the intestine s and cause vomiting and diarrhoea. There are m any varieties of E. coli, which are assigned to one of six groups based on the range of symptoms they cause. The most harmful group is called the verocytotoxic or verocytotoxin -producing E. coli (VTEC) , and the most common strain in the UK is E. coli O157. This type of E. coli can cause severe illness , and in some cases complications which can cause death. VTEC live in the intestines of healthy cattle and other animals and are present in their faeces which means they can be present on the land and in the water of the fields where the cattle live, and can potentially also be present in unpasteurised milk. The bacteria can also contaminate meat and the surrounding machinery which is used during the production of foods. Other E. coli that cause vomiting and diarrhoea are not thought to be linked with an anima l and the main source of infection is from the faeces of other infected humans. Humans can become infected with VTEC E. coli by eating contaminated undercooked meat, especially minced meat products , or from unpasteurised dairy products. Other foods such a s cooked meats, sandwiches , vegeta bles, salads, fruit and juices can also become contaminated and have been reported as sources of VTEC outbreaks. A second major source of VTEC infection is a faecally contaminated environment, for example fa rms that are open to the public , where the bacteria can be caught from direct contact with animals, their faeces or the environment. Infection can also be acquired on farms by contact with faecally -contaminated water, including that us ed for irrigation of cro ps. The seriousness of VTEC infection has prompted research to understand how and why the bacterium causes such a severe illness, and how farming and food production practices can be improved to reduce the potential risk to the consumer. This report summarises current UK research which has investigat ed E. coli which cause gastr oenteritis . It focuses on work to develop a greater understanding of the biology of E. coli and in particular on VTEC in relation to food production processes.

Background on enterovirulent E. coli 1.1. Escherichia coli are facultative bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract of human s and animals . Whilst commonly commensal bacteria, s ome E. coli strains are pathogenic as they cause disease of the gastrointestinal, urinary, or central nervous system s. This report focuses on enterovirulent E. coli which cause gastrointestinal tract disease in humans . 1.2. Gastrointestinal diseases are caused by enterovirulent strains o f E. coli which can be divided into categories each with distinct pathogenic schemes. The type of enterovirulent disease caused by a particular strain of E. coli depends on the distribution and expression of virulence factors , for example, adhesin molecules and toxins. Several clinical syndromes accompany infection with enterovirulent E. coli and include different t ypes and duration of diarrhoea (e.g. persistent, watery) and also a range of side effects including vomiting, pyrexia and abdominal cramps . 1.3. Over 700 antigenic types ( sero vars) of E. coli are recognized based on O (somatic) , H (flagellar ), and K (capsular) surface antigen profiles (Todar (2008 )). At one time serotyping was important in distinguishing the strains that actual ly cause disease. More recently , particularly for enterovirulent strains, identification and classification of the pathogenic E. coli has been based on their virulence factors . 1.4. For the purpose of this report, the term enterovirulent E. coli refers to six classes of enterovirulent E. coli listed below (Riemann and Cliver (2006), Labbe and Garcia (2001) ). The term V TEC refers to all veroc ytotoxin - producing E. coli. There are a number of serovar s of VTEC which have particular relevance to humans, for example also described as verocytotoxic or verocytotoxin -producing E. coli (VTEC) , or shiga producing E. coli (STEC). enterotoxigenic E. E. coli (EIEC) diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC) 1.5. A further class of enter ovirulent E. coli is adherent invasive E. coli (AIEC) which has been found to be associated with the inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative coliti Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 8 1.6. The most common strain of VTEC detected in the UK in human infections is E. coli O157 :H7. Other serovar s are less commonly observed or investigated and are therefore harder to diagnose. E. coli O157:H7 was first reported as a cause of gastrointestinal illness in humans in 1982 (Riley et al, (1983) ), and this serovar has the greatest impact on the human population in those countries with high sanitation standards. VTEC pose a significant hazard . The infectious dose for VTEC O157:H7 is estimated to be only 10 - 500 cells2 which is a much lower level than figures reported for other enterovirulent E. coli, for example ETEC (106 - 108), EPEC (106) and EIEC (106) (Labbe and Garcia (2001) ). Unlike the other enterovirulent E. coli, VTEC, especially O157:H7 , causes the particularly serious clinical conditions of Haemorrhagic Colitis (HC) in around 50 % of cases3 and Haemolytic Uraemic S yndrome (HUS) in around 5% of cases. Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) can also occur and can have a mortality rate in t he elderly as high as 50%4. A percentage of those developing these more serious infections go on to develop long -term health problems such as kidney disease. 1.7. The combination of a relatively low infectious dose and the serious morbidity and mortality provides a basis for the focus of projects on E. coli O157 :H7. A further important factor is the animal reservoir , and the relation ship of some infection s to food consumption for this type of E. coli. 2. The importance of the microbiological safety of food in relati on to VTEC 2.1. The reservoirs for the classes of enterovirulent E. coli vary and this has an impact on the relationship of the organism to contaminated food. The main reservoir for VTEC is the gastrointestinal tract in healthy cattle. Although E. coli O157: H7 has also been isolated from the intestinal tract of sheep, deer and other animals ( Riemann and Cliver (2006) ), cattle are the significant reservoir for the transmission and maintenance of this strain . Unlike VTEC, other enterovirulent E. coli do not have a clear association with an animal reservoir , hence infected humans and carriers are considered to be the main source of infection by ETEC, EPEC, E IEC, EAEC and DAE C (Labbe and Garcia (2001), Riemann and Cliver (2006) ). 2.2. Transmission of enterovirulent E. coli occurs via the faecal -oral route, hence most outbreaks result from exposure of human s to contaminated food/water , contaminated environment (e.g. farms which are open to the general public ) or person to person transmission . 2.3. The risk of transmissio n for ETEC, EPEC, EIEC, EAEC and DAE C is low in countries having high sanitary standards and practices, but is an important cause of diarrhoea in infants and travellers in underdeveloped countries or 2 http://www.foodsafety.gov/~mow/intro.html 3 HPA 2007 report http://www.hpa.org.uk/cdph/issues/CDPHvol3/No1/vtec.pdf 4 http://www.foodsafety.gov/~mow/intro.html MSFFG Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 9 regions of poor sanitation. Food become s contaminated fr om infected humans via poor sanitation, and food handling or processing . 2.4. Unlike the other enterovirulent E. coli where contamination is from the human host, the colonisation of VTEC in the intestines of farm animals leads to a number of potential routes of infection. The organism can enter the food chain by i) faecal con tamination of raw meat directly from the animal host during the process of evisceration and fleece/hide removal , ii) faecal contamination of meat from faeces present on slaughterhouse equipment or within the slaughterhouse environment and, less commonly, iii) by faecal contamination of unpasteurised milk on the farm . A second important source of VTEC O157 of animal origin is a contaminated environment, for example farms which are open to the public, where transmission to man occurs via direct contact with animals, their faeces or through the environment . Infection can also be acquired through consumption or contact with fae cally-contaminated water, including that used for irrigation of crops . 2.5. VTEC O157 is killed by adequate cooking of meat and pasteurisation of milk, but consumption of undercooked meat and raw dairy products has resulted in outbreaks of infection. Cross-contamination of ready -to-eat foods such as cooked meats can occur with reports of outbreaks linked to vegeta bles, salads, fruit and unpasteurised juices5. 3. Epidemiology in the UK 3.1. In 2008 there were 1248 laboratory confirmed cases of VTEC O157 infection reported in the UK (England and Wales (948), Scotland (241), Northern Ireland (59)), an increase on the numbers in 2007 (1113), but at a similar level to that seen in 2006 with 1234 cases. 3.2. Figure 1 shows that there are differences in the geographical distribution between countries. Scotland showing a consistently higher prevalence of approximately 4 cases per 100,000, as opposed to approximately 2 cases per 100,000 in England and Wales, and Northern Ireland. 3.3. The largest reported outbreak of E. coli O157 occurred in Osaka, Japan in July 1996 where there were 2,764 microbiologically confirmed cases of which 2,345 were school children from 47 schools. There were 121 cases of HUS resulting in t hree deaths. The source of the outbreak was identified as radish sprouts being served at schools (Pennington (2009)). 5 http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap15.html MSFFG Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 10 Figure 1 : Isolation rates per 100,000 of the population of E. coli O157 confirmed in laboratory isolates from humans6 3.4. The largest outbreak of E. coli O157 in the UK occurred in central Scotland during November 1996 where there were 279 confirmed cases of E. coli O157 and more than 2,500 people were investigated. There were 17 deaths either caused by E. coli O157 , or in which infection with it was a significant contributory factor (reviewed in Pennington (2009)). 3.5. More recently, a n outbreak of E. coli O157 occurred in South Wales in September 2005 which was the second largest outbreak in the UK. A total of 157 cases were identified, of which 118 were confirmed microbiologically as E. coli O157. Of those, 109 were of a strain unique to the o utbreak. Most cases were children in 44 scho ols across the area . Thirty -one people were admitted to ho spital and one child aged five, died. A public enquiry into the outbreak was led by Professor H ugh Pennington and a full copy of the report is available7. In summary, t he outbreak was caused by consumption of cooked meats that had been contaminated with E. coli O157 present on meat from an abattoir . 3.6. The risks associated with VTEC O157 are still very real and support the need for continued research in this area . A summary of cross funding body research on enterovirulent E. coli can help identify gaps and areas of research which will lead to a greater understanding the se organism s. 6 http://www.documents.hps.scot.nhs.uk/giz/graphs/20 08/rates.pdf 7 http://wales.gov.uk/ecolidocs/3008707/reporten.pdf?lang=en MSFFG Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 11 4. Previous MSFFG reports 4.1. VTEC projects have been the focus of previous reports from the MSFFG on E. coli, as V TEC causes serious illnesses with a high mortality rate especially in the context of the other enterovirulent E. coli and most other food-borne zoonoses . 4.2. Previous reports concerning VTEC have been produced by the MSFFG based on project reports in the MSFFG database . The initial report (UK publicly -funded research relating to verocytotoxin -producing Escherichia coli VTEC) was issued in 1999 and summarised the publicly funded research for the period 1990 to 1999 related to VTEC O157, as at the time this was the most frequent serovar isolated in the UK8. An update report was written in 20049 which had a broader remit to include research involving all verocytotoxin -producing E. coli (VTEC) that are pathogenic to man and of importance in food safety. In this document this report will be referred to as the 2004 VTEC report. 4.3. No reports on more general research projects on enterovirulent E. coli research have been published by the MSFFG group to date as the foc us has been on VTEC. 5. Focus of this report 5.1. Since 2004 there have been a number of new projects undertaken on VTEC O157 ident ified in the MSFFG database . This report provides an updated summary of research show ing what progress there has been in understan ding the pathogenicity of this or ganism and a lso studies into the relationship between this organism and the food chain. In addition a comprehensive review on VTEC was commissioned by the Food Standards Agency in 2004 , ending in 2008 , and this provide s information on the state of knowledge of VTEC up to that time (FSA B11010 ). 5.2. In addition to research projects in which the focus of investigation is VTEC , there are a number of projects describing research into the other enterovirulent groups of E. coli that are included in the MSFFG database. A number of these projects describe research applicable to both VTEC and enterovirulent non-VTEC . Given that these project s remain to be described and summarised in a MSFFG report, they have been included in this report alongside the update of VTEC research. 8 http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/verocytotoxin.pdf 9 http://www.msffg.org.uk/reports/reports/vtec2.pdf MSFFG Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 12 6. Research funded by other funding bodies Within the UK 6.1. Within the UK the majority of research on enterovirulent E. coli is funded by the BBSRC, FSA and Defra . A number of projects on E. coli are funded by the research councils (MRC, BBSRC , Wellcome Trust ) but have been excluded from discussions here as they do not specifically include research using verocytotoxic or enterovirulent strains of E. coli in relation to food borne illnesses. Similarly, projects using other model organisms or systems and whic h may have broader relevance have not been considered . 6.2. Between 2003 and 2008 The Wellcome Trust fun ded 14 projects on enterovirulent E. coli and/or enteropathogenicity totalling \u00a34.7 million10. A multidisciplinary project was also funded from 1999 to 2005. This project 'International Partnership Research Award in Veterinary Epidemiology (IPRAVE)11 : Epidemiology and evolution of Enterobacteriaceae infections in humans a nd domestic animals' focused on food-borne, zoonotic and Salmonella Typhimurium , and t hrough a series of field studies, collected over 7500 isolates which were made available to the scientific community . The Medical Rese arch Council research database12 (2004 -2008) records 5 grant awards which focus on enterovirulent E. coli, two of which describe research into EHEC and EPEC. Within EU funded Europe 6.3. Details of projects wholly or partially financed from the budget of the European Commission are held on a Research and Technological Development (RTD) database which contains information on projects from 1986 onwards, and is maintained by the Community Res earch and Development Information Service (CORDIS)13. 6.4. A total of 24 p rojects which described research applicable to enterovirulent strains of E. coli were identified in the database. Eleven of the 24 projects commenced after 2000 and two projects are curre nt. The research topics within this group of more recent projects include : assay development for diagnostics (3 projects ), prevention (1), ge nomic analysis/manipulation (4) and risk assessment and prevention (1). 6.5. An ongoing project (36256) funded by F ramework Programme 6 is the Pathogenic Escherichia Network (PEN) . This consists of a large number of international research groups ( European Union, USA, Chile, New Zealand, Israel, and Australia) working on E. coli O157 and other potentially 10 http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/Funding/Grants report 2000 -2008 13 emerging patho genic strains. This network is building on the previous E. coli Concerted Action (CT98 3935) project. In 2008 an international conference on Epidemiology and Transmission of VTEC and other Pathogenic Escherichia coli was held in Sweden as part of the PEN p roject and discussed topics such as risk factors, surveillance and molecular epidemiology. 6.6. A second large European Communities project funded under the International Cooperation programme was COST action (Foodborne Zoonoses: a Co -ordinated food chain approach) . This project involved researchers from 12 European countries and was completed in 2006. The main objective of the project was to achieve a better control of foodborne zoonotic infections by investigating new and emerging pathogens, harmonisin g diagnostics and typing and assessing the survival of pathogens through the food chain. 6.7. The programme on food and waterborne diseases (FWD) unit of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)14. The FWD has responsibility for surveillance n etworks that are or have been functioning at the EU level. The coordination of the former network En ter- net was transferred in 2007. In 2008, surveillance focused on six priority diseases: salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, VTEC/STEC infection, listeriosis , shigellosis and 2004 t he Sixth Framework Programme (FP6A) 'F ood quality and safety' theme funded the EU MED -VET-NET network which aims to unite medical and veterinary expertise in the fight against zoonoses and make better use of resour ces by sharing facilities internationally, centralising archives of reference material and standardising procedures to enable information to be pooled. A number of EU MED -VET-NET projects relevant to E. coli can be found listed on the MSFFG database (MVN -WP04, 07 and 26). Within the US 6.9. The scope of the information provided here is from the National Institute of Health database of funded research15. This database includes projects funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services (SAMHSA), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP), Agency for Heal th Care Research and Quality (AHRQ), and Office of Assistant Secretary of Health (OASH). 6.10. The database has recorded 500+ research projects on E. coli, with a subset of 47 projects researching aspects of the enterovirulent strains (ETEC, EPEC, EAEC, EIEC, DAEC, and http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/activities/diseaseprogrammes/pages/programme_on_food_and_water - borne_diseases_and_zoonoses.aspx 15 http://crisp.cit.nih.gov MSFFG Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 14 dissimilar to those described in the previous VTEC 2004 report, and include the fundamental biology and genetics of pathogenicity and c olonisation (36/47), prevention /reduction/treatment (7/47) and model development (4/47). Global initiatives 6.11. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has a department of Food Safety, and Zoonoses (FOS) and is developing a comprehensive strategy on strengthening food -borne disease surveillance. In September 2006, it convened an international consultation during which FOS and its multiple partners took stock of the currently available evidence and charted the strategic way forward to fill the data gap . This meet ing prompted the launch of the i nitiative to estimate the global burden of foodborne diseases from all major causes16. The WHO has also sponsored a number of earlier initiatives including in 2001 on Global surveillance of foodborne disease: devel oping a strategy and its interaction with risk analysis and in 2002 a consultation event in Europe on Method for foodborne surveillance in selected sites . 7. Scope and structure of this report 7.1. The MSFFG database17 is populated with research projects relevant to the microbiological safety of food funded by the member organisations and contains project information dating back to 1992 . A search of the database for projects that commenced between 1992 and 2008 using the term E. coli identified 346 projects . Many further projects on E. coli are funded by the research councils (MRC and BBSRC) but have been excluded from the MSFFG database as they do not specifically include research using verocytotoxic or enterovirulent strains of E. coli in relation to food borne illnesses. Similarly, research using other model organisms or systems and which may have broader relevance is not included. Post -graduate PhD studentships are also excluded from the MSFFG database. 7.2. In order to show the more recent progress in the understanding of the pathogenicity of enterovirulent E. coli the MSFFG agreed to focus on projects addressing enterovirulent E. coli from 2000 to 2008, after considering the science of the earlier projects either to hav e been superseded or included within more recent research. 7.3. The report a lso includes the summaries of VTEC projects undertaken between 2004 and 2008 to update the previous VTEC reports. 7.4. This rep ort is based on 85 projects identified in the MSFFG database . Funders of the projects are listed in Table 1 . Eighty eight percent of all 16 http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/foodborne_disease/burden _sept06/en/index.html 17 www.msffg.org.uk MSFFG Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 15 projects are funded by the FSA, DEFRA or BBSRC, with the other MSFFG member organisations , funding two or less projects. 7.5. The summaries of research projects are described in detail below. The initial sections (10 and 11) summarise projects describing basic fundamental research into the biology of enterovirulent E. coli. This includes studies into, for example, virulence factors present in the outer membrane of the bacteria , genomic studies and colonisation strategies. The sections have been subdivided into those projects that are VTEC specific and those which are applicable to all enterovirulent E. coli (including VTEC). 7.6. The sections (12 to 16 ) describing the applied resea rch projects have a much greater focus on VTEC rather than the broader group of enterovirulent E. coli. Where appropriate the applicability to the broader group is indicated.

A broad search of the whole database (including archived projects) was undertaken using the following terms : coli report 2000 -2008 16 A project data spreadsheet was generated by combining th e data bases. Any inappropriate records were removed from the list . Those projects with a project start date in 2000 onwards were ide ntified. Projects in the spreadsheets were then marked to indicate if they had already be en discussed in previous VTEC reports. This system ensured that there was no duplication and also captured any outstanding 2000 -2004 VTEC reports. The list of pro jects is given in Appendix 2. MSFFG Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 17 MSFFG funded Escherichia coli research i) VTEC research 2004 - 2008 a nd ii) other e nterovirulent E. coli research 2000 - 2008 9. Summary data 9.1. A total of 85 projects have been identified in the database. The projects are grouped according to i) whether they are VTEC specific, or ii) describe research that is applicable to more than one type of enterovirulent E. coli (including VTEC). Projects have also been categorised as either basic or applied based on the research information provided in the database . Basic research is considered to be projects that carry out fundamental studies (often structural, biochemical, or genetics based) directed towards a better understanding of the pathogenicity of E. coli. Projects which des cribe research into solving the practical issues of enterovirulent E. coli as it related to the food chain or human illness are considered as being applied. 9.2. Of the 8 5 projects , 59% (50) can be described as basic research and 40% (34) as applied. An additional project , funded by the Food Standards Agency ( FSA B11010 ), is a review of published VTEC research between 2000 and 2007 which includes descriptions of both basic and applied research. Fifty four per cent (46) of the projects describe VTEC specific research while 46% (39) of projects focus upon research applicable to all enterovirulent E. coli. 10. The biology of enterovirulent E. coli and their relationship with pathogenicity and colonis ation . 10.1. The pathogenicity and colonisation ability of E. coli is associated with the expression of distinctive bacterial properties, products, or structures referred to as virulence factors. Virulence factors can be structural proteins located in the out er membrane of the bacteria , may be a protein or metabolite involved in the metabolism of the bacteria or are molecules designed to exert their effect following their export from the bacteria and subsequent insertion into the host cell. Additional protein structures and metabolites can also be present in the bacteria which function in conjunction with the virulence factors. The following sections describe projects which are investigating a range of physiological components . While a number of the projects ar e investigating VTEC specific mechanisms, others have a broad applicability to enterovirulent E. coli. The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) complex All enterovirulent E. coli 10.2. The Tat complex is a trans -membrane protein which is used to secrete fully folded virulence factors across the bacterial membrane in some strains of E. coli. A functional genomic characterisation of the Tat complex was under taken ( BBSRC BBSEJ0000A221 ), and a structural and function al analysis of virulence factors that it delivers, together with protein factors and MSFFG Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 18 pathways required for the assembly of proteins onto the outer bacterial envelope were investigated (BBSRC BBSEJ0000A189 and P16414 ). Verocytotoxin Escherichia coli (VTE C) and coli (EPEC) possess a type-III secretion system (TTSS) for effacement (LEE) . The TTSS translocates proteins into host intestinal cells which then subvert s eukaryotic signalling pathways e.g. inflammatory responses, tight junction barrier function, the cell cycle, mitochondrial function and apoptosis and also target the cytos keleton . 10.4. A number of studies were undertaken to develop a more detailed understandi ng of the structure an d assembly of the TTSS and its associated LEE. Research was undertaken to assess the molecular process of assembly of \"pedestal -like\" pseudopods (part of TTSS) which bind the bacteria to the host cell surface ( MRC G0500583 ), and electron microscopy combined with in situ immunogold labelling was used to examine the structure of the EPEC:VTEC TTSS, its assembly and the secretion of effector proteins ( BBSRC B17144 ). 10.5. It was thought that only a small number of effectors were translocated through the TTSS in E. coli. However, through genomic data -mining, research has identified nearly a hundred novel effector candidates, in the E. coli O157 genome and investigate d how ma ny were translocated into human cells and where they localized (BBSRC BBD0101951 ). 10.6. Transcription of LEE genes is effected by regulators, EtrA , EivF and Ler , which exert a profound effect in EHEC (but not in EPEC). Direct targets of EtrA and EivF were identified ) and research was undertaken (BBSRC BBE0208601 ) to study the Ler regulator. Other bacterial components associated with pathogenicity 10.7. VTEC /EPEC infection is cha racterised by an attachment of the bacteria to the host c ell via an outer membrane protein (intimi n) which binds to a protein receptor in t he host membrane. This receptor was originally thought to be a host protein, but has recently been found to be of bacterial or igin. Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli has been used t o identify and characterise this host cell receptor (MRC G0401551 ). All enterovirulent E. coli 10.8. A detailed mass and atomic force spectroscopy investigation o f the folding and polymerisation of chaperone: polysaccharide subunit complexes of the MSFFG Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 19 F1 capsule polysaccharide is relevant to the adhesive organelles found in pathogenic E. coli and Salmonella (BBSRC B16926 ). 10.9. Genetic and biochemical characterisation of the Rcs two -component pathway in E. coli was undertaken in order to understand its regulatory role in gene expression during the formation of biofilm surface -associated communities formed following transition from planktonic growth to growth on a solid surface ( BBSRC P16371 ). 10.10. The role of the export of surface asso ciated polysaccharides across the outer -membrane in E. coli was investigated by analysis of the KpsD topology, structural function and interaction with the peptidoglycan cell wa ll (BBSRC BBSB09627 ). 10.11. An autotransporter mechanism which occurs in EAEC uses a plasmid -encoded toxin (pet) to produce cytotoxic and enterotoxic effects on the host . Aspects of this autotransporter secretion: inner membrane, periplasmic and out er membrane translocation were investigated (BBSRC P14130 ). 10.12. While not directly investigating E. coli, project BBSRC BB/C509807/1 includes highly relevant research with full characterisation of tripartite ATP- independ ent periplasmic (TRAP) transporters . These proteins are thought to be involved in the transport of free sialic acid which is removed from the host cell surface by a viru lence factor synthesised by bacterial pathogens . Toxins coli (VTEC, ETEC and EAEC ) produce toxins which causes severe damage to intestinal epithelial cells. VTEC produces toxins which are termed either verocytotoxins (giving the acronym VTEC) or Shiga -like toxins (giving the acronym STEC , for S higa toxin producing E. coli). VTEC 10.14. The inter -relationship between the expression, synthesis and release of toxin, phage mediated lysis, and the SOS response (an inducible DN A repair system that allows bacteria to survive sudden increases in DNA damage ) in Shiga toxin -producing E. coli (STEC/ VTEC) was investigated (BBSRC D12994 ). Metabolism of enterovirulent E. coli in response to environmental factors All enterovirulent E. coli 10.15. Bacteria can utilise a wide range of inorganic and organic nitrogen sources and the mechanisms that regulate the genes required for this metabolism are complex. The success of E. coli and its ability to colonise and survive MSFFG Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 20 stress conditions is likely to be related to a number of adaptive metabolic responses. 10.16. The flavohaemoglobin Hmp of Escherichia coli and Salmo nella provides protection from nitric oxide (NO) and ni s tress. An evaluation of Hmp (BBSRC P18939 ) dissected the roles of the haem and flavin domains and identified additional mechanisms for NO and nitrosative stress tolerance . The genetic responses mounted by E. coli to nitrosative and oxidative stresses in vitro were also studied (BBSRC P15901 ). 10.17. The transporter CydDC is essential for assembly of cytochrome bd, an oxidase that is critical for growth under conditions of stress and is observed to be required for pathogenicity. The role of CydDC in the maintenance metal lomic characterisation of E. coli examined the effect of zinc on the expression of genes, some of which were found to be involved in antibiotic resistance (BBSRC BBC5098311 ). 10.19. The effect of environmental signals, or the infection process on the expression of genes involved in S. Typhimurium and E. coli infection was investigated (BBSRC BBSEF00041208 ) using a functional genomic approach and Green Fluorescent Protein . Induction of virulence in commensal E. coli 10.20. Virulence can be induced in E. coli as the bacteria have the ability to acquire genetic information from a number of sources including bacterial viruses or plasmids. The genetic information can becomes incorporated into the bacterial DNA and is thus transc ribed and translated along with the bacteria's own DNA. VTEC 10.21. Verocytotoxin -encoding bacteriophage s (VT-phages) are responsible for the toxigenic conversion of E. coli by integration of their verocytotox in genes into the host genome. T hese infection proc esses are thought to have important implications for pathogenicity. A VT -phage model (with a bank of VT-phages) was used in project BBSRC BBSB05265 to characterise the mechanisms that dictat ed binding to the bacterial host cell following V T- phage contact, phage immunity and integration into the host genom e. MSFFG Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 21 Other factors that affect successful colonisation All enterovirulent E. coli 10.22. Many E. coli secrete a bacteriocidal colicin which has cytotoxic , receptor binding and translocation domain s. A structura l and functional analysis of protein interactions of colicin A and colicin E9 with their translocation proteins was carried out (BBSRC BBD0163201 ). Host responses 10.23. The host response to infection with enterovirulent E. coli includes activation of both immune and inflammatory mechanisms, with an influx of the appropriate cell type to the site of colonisation. Enterovirulent E. coli have developed a number of mechanisms to avoid normal host defence mechanisms. VTEC 10.24. VTEC, together with a range of other pathogens show tropism for the surface of the organised lym phoid tissue of the gut and the pathogen is then able to modulate host responses and compromise mucosal anti -bacterial immunity. This tropism was investigated by assessing the effects of EHEC on dendritic ce ll function in human Peyers patches and with dendritic cells which neurochemicals tyramine and norepinephrine (NE) produced by the host under stress or consumed in the diet contribute to the virulence of EHEC and Salmonella was investigated (BBSRC BBSEI00001195 and BBSRC BBC5180221 ). 10.26. The influence which acts both as an inhibitor of lymphocyte function and as an adhesion molecule in vitro , on intestinal c olonisation was analys ed using EHEC (BBSRC BBSEI00000952 ). 10.27. A better understan ding the molecular basis of virulence of EHEC serovar O157:H7 in intestinal colonisation of ruminants of project BBSRC BBSEI00001209 . The colonisation ability of strains of EHEC O157:H7 with deletions of specific virulence genes was tested . Strains were given orally to calves and the course of faecal excretion of the bacteria was monitored for 14 days. EPEC 10.28. An animal model of colitis used the protein intimin of enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) transfected into pathogen Citrobacter rodentium , and a number of different knockout mice, were used to investigate the pathways by which activated T cells remodel colonic mucosa and to MSFFG Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 22 determine which were the critical molecules in vivo (BBSRC S11925 ). Identification of new factors involved in the pathogenicity of E. coli 10.29. The advent of genetic mining techniques, molecular biology, and proteomics together with the availability of the genome sequence map for E. coli has provided the tools required for the identification of new virulence factors . VTEC 10.30. The factors mediating colonisation of cattle by enterohaemorrhagic E. coli were identified using the interactions of EHEC and specific EHEC mutants with bovine intestine in in vitro organ culture and with bovine intestinal mucosa in vivo (BBSRC BBSEI00000715 ). 10.31. An attempt to identify ne w additional colonisation and survival factors for EHEC was undertaken (BBSRC D14378 Signature -Tagged Mutagenesis of the mouse pathogen C. rodentium was used, and the function of the product of any identified genes was assessed using in vitro organ culture of intestinal mucosa. 10.32. Signature tagged and directed mutagenesis was also used to identify the contribution of non -LEE encoded factors of EHEC e (DEFRA OZ0713 ). The relationship between concurrent infection with parasites and enhance ment of the colonisation and persistence of E. coli O157:H7 in sheep was also investigated. All enterovirulent E. coli 10.33. A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) investigation of infection was performed in project BBSRC JE514316 where virulence factors were structurally characterised and mechanisms of function proposed for key bacterial pathogens including E. coli, Salmonella Typhi, Helicobacter pylori . Genomic studies of E. coli VTEC 10.34. Analysis of the E. coli O157:H7 complete genome sequence has indicated that E. coli O157:H7 contains 138 7 genes that are not present in the E. coli K-12 laboratory strain . Approximately 60 % of these E. coli O157:H7 -specific genes present in pathogenicity islands have no known fu nction18. 10.35. A microarray of the complete E. coli O157:H7 genome was used to study the prevalence of O157 -specific genes in other EHEC serovar s and to 18 http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6819/full/409529a0.html MSFFG Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 23 analyse the transcription of EHEC genes in vitro and in vivo (BBSRC BBSEI000001013 ). All enterovirulent E. coli genomics study of motility and associated regulons significant in environmental survival and persistence was carried out usin g the known genome sequences ( BBSRC BBE01044X1 ). Pathotypes were compared and the diversity of function of transcription networks within 'wild' members of the species was investigated to obtain a clear view of the relevance of the K -12 lab model as a paradigm for the species. 10.37. The sequence of the genome of enterotoxigenic (ETEC) E. coli H10407 was the final pathotype of E. coli to be completed (BBSRC BBC5100751 and BB/C510508/1 ). Phylogenetic distribution of ETEC was also determined using multilocus sequence typing and strains of ETEC representative of each phylogenetic cluster were then examined by whole genome PCR and microarray to determine gene content and genetic structure. 10.38. A multi-level systems biology approach was used (BBSRC BB/F003463/1 ) to describe how a number of functional network modules emerge from a mathematical model of E. coli respiratory adaptation to oxygen. The model was the n enriched by incorporation of new \"omi c\" data. 10.39. Whole genome sequence information of Salmonella , E. coli, Campylobacter and Streptomyces was mined in order to identify key questions such as ; which genes do bacteria switch on to cause food poisoni ng or in response to environmental signals , and which bacterial virulence genes are induced by novel environmental factors relevant to disease (BBSRC BBSEF00041407 ). 10.40. A computational methodology was used to generate inferences on the causal relationship between genes, proteins and metabolites, and to reconstruct transcriptional and metabolic networks representative of the response of E. coli to acid stress ( BBSRC BB/C515104/1 ). 10.41. taxon -specific databases with additional analytical and visualisation tools is a follow on project to th e E. coli BASE website and database dedicated to comparative genomics of E. coli and related bacteria of relevance in the AgriFood context (BBSRC BBE0111791 ). Regulation of gene expression All enterovirulent E. coli 10.42. E. coli contain CreBC which is a regulator of the expression of genes whose products are involved in intermediary metabolism. The extent to which MSFFG Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 24 CreBC infl uenced gene expression was examined using mutants of known CreBC activity together with the roles of two metabolic (environmental) signals that mediated the control of cre regulon g ene expression by CreBC (BBSRC BB/C514266/1 ). 11. Assays for d etection, typing of enterovirulent E. coli VTEC 11.1. Atypical sorbitol -fermenting (SF) strains of E. coli O157:H7 have recently emerged in the UK and cannot be identified on the standard detection media. Investigations have found that SF E. coli O157:H 7 possesses the ability to bind and accumulate a dye , and when plated out forms red colonies . This capability was used to optimise a medium -based detection procedure alongside a multiplex polymerase chain rea ction method for the detection of virulence genes (FSA B11013 ). All enterovirulent E. coli 11.2. Next generation microarray technology was used to develop new, versatile and broadly applicable arrays for both expression and ChIP -on-chip (transcription factor binding to the genome) studies for multiple E. coli genomes (BBSRC BBF00396X1 ). Intact mRNA was isolated and amplified E. coli, Salmonella Enteritidis and Listeria monocyto genes . However, further investigations found that the presence of mRNA did not correlate well with a measure of cellular viability (Defra URG/001/99 ). Current Methods and Monitoring Strategies on E. coli and Total Coliform Measurements (collaboration wit h American Water Works Association Research Foundation (AWWARF )) were also investigated (Defra WT02059 ). EAEC 11.3. The Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) are an emerging cause of persistent and acute diarrhoea in humans . Infections caused by EAEC are under - diagnosed due to difficulties in differentiating the organisms from other E. coli and the considerable heterogeneity within the category. For the same reasons, very little is known about infection vehicles or reservoirs for EAEC. Development of a range of diagnostic tests for the detection of enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC ) included m ethods using genetic identification of conserved markers specific to EAEC, detection of known specific genes using multiplex PCR method, and also tests to identify (FSA B14002 and B14003 ). MSFFG Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 25 12. Surveillance and management of VTEC in the food chain 12.1. This section is subdivided and begins by describing projects concerned with agricultural land and water. Subsequent sections span meat production and processing from farm to food produc tion, and conclude by describing projects concerning consumer practices . Projects which deal solely with surveillance data are not included in this report. Agricultural land and water 12.2. The survival of E. coli O157 in soil at New Deer, Aberdeenshire was investigated by researchers involved in project FSA Scotland S01004 . 12.3. Modelling of E. coli transport through soil/ agricultural systems estimated the risk of faecal pathogens reaching surface or groundwater bodies. A geographical information system (GIS) based screen was then used to investigated the risk of diffuse (true non -point source) pollution to water bodies wit hin different national catchments (SEERAD QSR/002/03 ). 12.4. The restocking of farm land (following a Foot and Mouth outbreak) was used to monitor the impact of changes in stocking density on the levels of total coliforms, faecal coliforms and enterococci from a range of water sources. Tentative relationships between stock density and faecal indicator organism concentrations were developed (Environment Agency SCO20045SR ). 12.5. Information on the use of water in UK agriculture (irrigation, produce washing, drinking supplies, pesticide and fertiliser applications and glasshouse production) and the associated data on pathogen levels in agricultural water was collated and used to assess the risks to food safety from th e presence of pathogenic micro organisms in farm water supplies (FSA B17001 ). 12.6. Strategies for reducing the risk of E. coli O157 infection to people in rural communities are being developed following the identification of some key factors involved in the spread of human food-borne pathogens in these environments . This will lead to the production of detailed risk management strategies on rural E. coli O157 infection to inform government policy (Research Councils UK RELU -01). Milk production 12.7. Transmission of VTEC can potentially occur from a contaminated farm environment to food stuffs. The prevalence of pathogens , including VTEC O157 , in unpa steurised milk was determined by sampling in-line milk filters from 100 commer cial dairy herds. The consumption of raw milk by farm families was also surveyed to obtain evidence of exposure to potentially harmful micro organisms (FSPB 00-RESR -046). MSFFG Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 26 12.8. In order to generate a correlation between bacterial counts in milk and dairy hygiene inspectorate farm audit score s pathogen markers in raw milk have been assessed for their effectiveness as indicators of farm hygiene (FSA B12002 ). Primary meat production 12.9. Primary meat production involves the rearing of the farm animals, the transport of livestock and the initial production of meat carcasses at the abattoirs. Of the cattle positive for E. coli O157:H7, a minority excrete large numbers of the bacteria in their faeces and these animals are considered to be essential for the transmission and maintenance of infection. It is thought that successful prevention of the maintenance of E. coli O157:H7 in the cattle population can be achieved by treating colonised and high -shedding animals. The major area where E. coli O157:H7 colonises cattle is the surface of the rectum and the removal of bacteria from this region can result in a massive reduction in num bers passed in the faeces19. 12.10. The immunology of endemic infectious diseases in ruminants was investigated with a focus on the transmission of VTEC. Research included, the role of the host, and of the verocytotoxin encoding bacteriophages and the application of immunological and genomics to investigating VTEC infections ( DEFRA VT0102 ). 12.11. The prevalence and frequency of high level E. coli O157 and non -O157 VTEC in the faeces of sheep presented for slaughter in Scotland was investigated by microbiological sampling (FSA Scotland S14005 ). The data was used in the refinement of risk assessments for infection in humans and for comparison with prevalence estimations for cattle for both E. coli O157 and non -O157 VTEC. 12.12. Finished beef cattle on commercial farms were screened for E. coli O157:H7 (DEFRA OZ0714 of antiseptic treatment of the rectum to reduce the prevalence rate and shedding levels of E. coli O157:H7 was measured (DEFRA OZ0714 ) and seasonal variation patterns were explored ( FSA S01014 ). A further investigation examined the two routes of transmission of the bacteria ; direct contact (via external body surfaces) or via environmental surfaces contaminated with faeces contai ning E. coli O157:H7 . 12.13. In 2002 legislation in Northern Ireland required red meat carcasses to be microbiologically tested using a destructive excision protocol. Alternative carcass sampling protocols for cattle, sheep and pigs were evaluated to generate equivalent non -destructive methods for adoption throughout the UK (DARD 0145 ). 19 http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Document.aspx?Document=OZ0712_7089_FRP.doc MSFFG Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 27 12.14. Key areas which increased the risk of the spread of contamination with food-borne pathogens were identified at various points along the lamb production/processing chain (on -farm management practices as well as transport, marketing and lairage factors) . This led to the development and evaluation of intervention methods to control the spread (FSA M01015 ). 12.15. An examination of the effects of dietary and transport factors and of straw bedding and clipping on the cleanliness of cattle presented at the abattoir identified the most significant factor s affecting faecal shedding of potentially zoonotic bacteria (FSA M01013 ). The findings of this and an earlier project (FSA M01009 ) were disseminated to the wider industry. 12.16. Using information collected on the epidemiology of VTEC O157 in cattle through project DEFRA OZ0138 , the effect of various control measures was examined and a model developed which simulate d transmission of VTEC within a beef farm (DEFRA OZ0145 ). 12.17. of zoonotic pathogen evolution, transmission and control, the epidemiology of human Campylobacter , and the role of wildlife as reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens (Campylobacter and VTEC). Methods included modelling and network - theory to describe the complex interaction s that drive the dissemination of pathogens through populations. Veterinary Research Training fellowships (DEFRA VT0101 ) also provided training to veterinarians to improve their awareness of th e concept and practices of epidemiology. 12.18. Various electronic systems in Europe and the rest of the world record the results of anti - and post -mortem meat inspections in beef, sheep and pig abattoirs. A review assessed the se data capture systems against criteria developed to meet UK data collection requirements ( FSA M01031 ). Strategies to manage E. coli levels in farm animals 12.19. As farm animals are the main reservoir for VTEC an additional way of reducing the risk of contaminated meat and thus risk to human health, may be to reduce the levels of bacteria which reside within the animal. A number of strategies have been described. 12.20. Vaccines based on two factors that influence intest inal colonisation by EHEC, intimin and lymphostatin were assessed for their possible potential to control EHEC colonisation in cattle in two projects (BBSRC 1028 and the related project BBSEI00001028 ). A vaccine and its delivery system was also developed and investigated based on the antigens Loc8 fimbrial adhesin, the H7 flagellin protozoa on the subsequent behaviour of verotoxigenic E. coli was investigated. In particular, whether engulfment MSFFG Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 28 afforded greater protection after subsequent release of the bacterium through induction of a cross -protection phenomenon ( DARD 0260 ). 12.22. The molecular mechanisms by which a selection of salicylanilide compounds reduced pathogenicity by disabling specific vi rulence factors was investigated as a method of limiting the effects of the E. coli Type III secretion system (TTSS) ( antimicrobially active components were extracted from hydro ponically produced plants . Subsequent animal trial s were conducted on up to 3 compounds which were tested in for their ability to reduce the load of pathogens E. coli and Listeria (BBSRC BBSEG00006275 ). Food Processing 12.24. Meat processing follows on from primary production and involves the application of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) principles . This is a systematic preventive approach to food safety that addresses physical, chemical , and biological hazards as a means of prevention rather than reliance on finished product inspection or testing . HACCP is used in the food industry to identify potential food safe ty hazards, so that key intervention points known as Critical Control Points (CCP 's) can be used to reduce or eliminate the risk of hazards being realized. The system is used at all stages of food production and preparation processes including packaging , distribution, e tc. Further discussion of HACCP and other aspects of risk can be found in the MSF FG report on Risk Assessment which covers other bacterial species in addition to E. coli20. 12.25. The microbiological verification of HACCP in meat plants was assessed with a review of the literature on methods for measuring microbiological load on carcasses and cut meat, and their suitability for verifying that measures taken at CCPs reduce the risk of contamination by enteric pathogens to acceptable levels ( FSA M01014 ). Data was also collated about best HACCP practices across Europe and an analysis drew comparisons between countries (FSA M01030). 12.26. The survival of VTEC O157 through the manufacture of cheese produced from unpasteurised milk was investigated by measuring the presence and number of VTEC O157 cells during the cheese making process following their inoculation into the raw milk starting material (FSA B12008) . 12.27. Animal by -products are classified into three groups ( Category 1 -3) according to the risk they present to public health. Category 3 materia ls can be used to produce animal/pet food but there is no requirement for marking 20http://www.food.gov.uk/science/research/researchinfo/foodborneillness/micr ofunders/msffg/msffgr iskassessmentreport MSFFG Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 29 this material , so it could be fraudulently used in the production of human food. A set of criteria were developed for potential markers which could be used for the detection of Category 3 animal by -products in human food products ( FSA M01026 ). Food outlets 12.28. Butchering practices used to prepare steaks may introduce micro - organisms onto the surface of the meat, even though the inner tissue area is considered sterile. Research investigated the microbiologically safe ty of rare steak s with an uncooked centre with respect to bacterial pathogens including E. coli (Meat and Livestock Commission MLC 01)21. 12.29. A comparison of businesses with a history of food poisoning outbreak s to those which had not experienced any outbreaks examined the factors beyond food safety control failures; i.e. the underlying management, operational and commercial systems , to help further explain why outbreaks occur (FSA E03004 ). Practices in the home 12.30. The risks of food -poisoning from consumer practices can be divided into two areas; the consumption of products with a high potential bacterial burden and practices in the home that can c ontribute to food poisoning. A MSFFG report \" Food preparation practices and behaviour in relation to the microbiological safety of food \" has been published which covers other bacterial species in addition to E. coli22. 12.31. The levels of pathogens including E. coli O157 and Campylobacter spp were measured on kitchen cloths ( a potential vehicle for cross - contamination) taken from households ( FSA B02015 ). 13. Epidemiology of human VTEC and other enterovirulent E. coli 13.1. Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and causes of diseases within a population. Epidemiolog ical studies can be used for a number of descriptive purposes ; surveillance of the occurrence of the disease, study of disease progression, identification of prognostic factors and evaluation of treatments (Raymond et al, (2005 )). All enterovirulent E. coli 21 http://www.msffg.org.uk/project.php?pid=1064 22http://www.food.gov.uk/science/research/researchinfo/foodborneillness/microfunders/msffg/msffgj an09 MSFFG Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 30 13.2. A report of the Department of Health funded IID (Infectious Intestinal Disease) Study in England by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in 2000 defined disease burden, and calibrated national surveillance systems, (an estimation of the factor by which the number of cases of infection with specified pathogen s needed to be multiplied to establish the actual number of infections in the community ). Since this original study was undertaken, several structural changes have occurred in national surveillance. To repopulate the calibration with contemporary data a se cond IID study (FSA B18021 ) was commissioned to estimate prospectively the burden and causes of IID in the population and to compare the results with national surveillance data . 13.3. The relationship between virulence genotype, strain genotype and phenotype was investigated and defined for a number of non-O157 VTEC strains which had been isolated from anim als, foods and human infections (HPA 2005219 ). 14. Antibiotic resistance 14.1. A search of the database revealed a number of projects in which antibiotic resistance in E. coli was investigated. With the exception of one project , all projects that were identified in the E. coli search have been discussed within the March 2007 report from the Microbiological Safety of Food Funders Group on UK publicly funded research on microbial antibiotic resistance in relation to the safety of food23. These projects are listed in Appendix 3 but will not be further described here to mini mise duplication of information . 14.2. One mechanism of a ntibiotic resistance is caused in part by bacterial efflux pumps which are membrane proteins that can pump a wide variety of antibiotics out of bacterial cells, and quickly adapt to recognise new antibiotics. The folding and assembly of small multi -drug transport proteins (SMRs) focusing on the proteins from E. coli (EmrE), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TBsmr) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAsmr) was investigated by examination of their response to a diverse array of drugs (BBSRC B19845 ). 15. Risk assessment 15.1. The search of the database revealed a number of projects (see Appendix 4) which looked at E. coli O157 in relation to risk. These have been captured in a report from the Microbiological Safety of Food Funders Group on UK publicly funded research relating to risk assessment and the microbiological safety of food24. 23 http://www.msffg.org.uk/reports/antibioticresistance.html 24http://www.food.gov.uk/science/research/researchinfo/foodborneillness/microfunders/msffg/msffgr iskassessmentreport MSFFG Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 31 16. Avian pathogenic strains 16.1. Avian patho genic E. coli (APEC) are key to the cause of colibacillosis, a severe systemic disease in poultry which can significantly impact on the poultry industry . The avian pathogenic E. coli factors that mediate carriage and virulence of APEC in poultry are poorly characterised, few genetic traits have been identified that delineate virulent and avirulent strains, and the role of such genes in pathogenesis in food -producing animals has rarel y been tested. A number of studies (for example Moulin -Schouleur et al (2007), Zhao et al (2009) ) have been published which describe the similarities and differences of APEC to other human extra -intestinal pathogenic E. coli, but currently there has been n o link established between APEC and food consumption. 16.2. APEC genes, mediating respiratory tract colonisation and systemic virulence in turkey s, were identified and surveyed for the prevalence of APEC virulence factors. The virulence factors, in particular t hose predicted to be surface -exposed, were investigated by cloning, expression and purification. Their ability to induce cross -protective immunity against colibacillosis was also examined (BBSRC BB/E001661/1 and BBS/E/I/00001291 ). 17. Gaps in current MSFFG funded research 17.1. As described in Section 9, this r eport identifies groupings of a) basic fundament al projects on enterovirulent E. coli and b) applied projects with a focus on VTEC in relation to food sa fety. Basic Research 17.2. A key theme in the basic research projects is the use of molecular biology technologies . As predicted in the 2004 VTEC report , the availability of the complete genome sequence of E. coli K12,25 and, more recently , the enteropathogenic strains O42 and O127:H6 strain E2348/6926 has had a significant impa ct on both the technical approaches and data which projects now have available to use in their investigations. Project s have used genomic methods extensively, often in combination with structural and/or functional analysis , for example to investigat e the effect of regulating factors on the expression of virulence genes at the molecular level . Gene sequencing and whole genome mining has also been undertaken, as has a comparative genomics study of a number of pathotypes and the K12 lab model. A number of pro jects also descr ibe genomic search es for novel virulence factors . Interestingly, s ubstantially less work has been undertaken on induction of virulence genes into commensal E. coli. 25 http://www.genome.wisc.edu/ 26 http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Escherichia_Shigella/ MSFFG Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 32 17.3. The work described in this and previous VTEC report (s) has improved our understanding of E. coli pathogenicity . However, a number of gaps still exist: The attaching and colonisation mechanism in colonised, asymptomatic calves and how this comp ares to the findings in humans. The reasons VTEC adhere to some species and not ot hers. Resistance to VTEC in humans and the role of asymptomatic carriers, particularly in relation to age and dose. 17.4. This list highlights what could be considered as gaps bridging the divide between basic understanding and the animal reservoir - host system. Such projects could be described as translational , using the knowledge obtained from basic research with genes and cells and linking it to pathogenicity in the animal reservoir and in humans . Additional information describing the benefits of translational research is available in the publication Systems biology: a vision for engineering and medicine27 Within the field of E. coli research studies could investigate , for example, differences in growth of VTEC in the laboratory and in vivo or the expression of new virulence factors in the animal host . The gap in research relating to the human immunological response to VTEC and other E. coli strains could also be captured by translational studies. The knowledge obtained could be of great value if it was translated into therapeutic preventions or could ide ntify biological differences between people who become infected and those which can carry VTEC . Detection and Identification 17.5. The 2004 VTEC report identified the following areas in the context of this report : The need for an agreed, validated and robus t set of primary isolation and identification protocols for use in research projects involving the detection of a wide variety of serovar s of E. coli. This is especi ally important for VTEC and enteroaggregative E. coli. The need to determine how the current typing schemes relate to the E. coli genome sequences and other genetic information now available, including the genomic method s used for E. coli O157. 17.6. Current projects describe the development and use of P olymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for identification of virulence determinants. PCR as a method, in combination with the use of microarrays , may therefore at some point supersede the use of sero typing. As PCR methods are still being developed, along with the identificat ion of new vi rulence factors, there remains a need to develop both standardised protocols for the dete ction of enterovirulent strains and a system of identification . This is particularly 27 A pdf copy of this publication is available at http://www.acmedsci.ac.uk/p99puid97.html MSFFG Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 33 important for non -O157 strains which can be less easy to detect with current methods. The Public Inquiry r eport into the South Wales 2005 outbreak of E. coli O157 recommend ed Variable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR) should be validated as a standard method for the typing of E. coli O15728. Applied Research 17.7. Projects summarised in this report focus ed on identification o f the sources of VTEC infection , for example agricultural water, farm animals and their contamination of the environment , and then look to improve, or put in place risk management strategies . Mathematica l models and geographical information systems have also been used, which suggests a multidisciplinary approach to assessing sources of infection and epidemiology. This report , together with the previous 2004 VTEC report , also show s that the transfer of VTE C from the farm to the abattoir and strategies to reduce it has been investigated and some interventions identified . In addition, the Public Inquiry report into the South Wales Outbreak27 highlighted the need to look into the feasibility of identify ing and managing \"super shedder\" cattle on farms as a potential means of reducing the likelihood of spreading E. coli O157 to other cattle . Also of importance is the need to continue to investigate means of eliminating or controlling E. coli O157 in livestock, for example with vaccines or using bacterio phage or competitive exclusion. 17.8. There remains a lack of data on how VTEC survives during different stages of the food supply chain, including the preparation, preservation and treatm ent of food. 17.9. In the 2 004 VTEC report it was suggested that with any aspects of the reduction and elimination of VTEC from the food chain, it would be important to understand how any proposed changes in practice would be received by the various parts of the food supply industry , including farmers . Reports described here have successfully included surveys and data gathering from user groups in drawing their conclusions. Further information is contained in the MSFFG report on UK publicly funded research relating to food preparatio n practices and behaviour29. 17.10. Much of the focus of VTEC monitoring and assessment has been on animals, with fewer projects focussing on human epidemiology . There remain gaps in areas such as the causes of variation in infections in man and the long-term consequences of infection following acute phase infection complications such as TTP and HUS. Such research could go some way to wards addressing t he human epidemiology in the context of VTEC pathogenicity. 28 http://wales.gov.uk/ecolidocs/3008707/reporten.pdf?lang=en 29 http://www.msffg.org.uk/reports/reports/foodprep.pdf MSFFG Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 34 18. Conclusions 18.1. The projects described in t his rep ort provide data and informatio n on the fundamental biology of the pathogenicity of enterovirulent E. coli, and the identification and reduction of VTEC in the food chain in the context of human health. Projects t end to focus on either basic or applied research and there are similar numbers of projects distributed between the se two areas. Initially the report aimed to review two sets of projects; those describing research into VTEC and those relating to non -verocytotoxin producing enterovirulent E. coli. However, on closer examination of project information it is apparent that although many projects d o not specifically describe VTEC as the organism of interest, the data and findings of these studies are relevant to VTEC in addition to other enterovirulent E. coli. 18.2. Greater insights into the function and regulation of virulence genes have been developed especially in relation to how they are affected by the environment , preventative agents, and regulator genes . Additionally, identification of additional put ative virulence factors and comparative genome studies has been possible due to the availability of genome sequences. The classification of enterovirulent E. coli has been influenced by the increased use of molecular methods, e.g. PCR which can identify v irulence factors/gene s and relate the information back to the different strains. The use of this technology, together with the potential discovery of new virulence factors does suggest that the classification system is still evolving. However, there will be a need to standardise classifications within the foreseeable future. 18.3. In general the colonisation of farm animals with VTEC and the contamination of farming environment are well established in terms of research. Those projects which are investigating VTEC with respect to food production and public health have a broa d research base, assessing VTEC from farm to food production to consumer behaviour, together with other project concerned with, for example, reduction strategies, vaccines, and human epidemi ology. 18.4. This report demonstrates that current research on enterovirulent E. coli has a strong basic research base, and that there is a good understanding of VTEC in relation to food production. Th is could be strengthened by using the information gained from funda mental molecular studies to further ou r understanding of the difference s in behaviour of VTEC in cattle and other animals compared to humans . This would involve develop ing suitable in vivo models and taking a strongly molecular approach to unders tanding the colonisation events in different species. In addition , the rapid increase in availability of molecular data would benefit from a scheme to pool resource s in this area. MSFFG Enterovirulent E. coli report 2000 -2008 35 19.
