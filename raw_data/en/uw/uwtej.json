You should continue to [breastfeed](/breastfeeding-your-baby) your baby if you have a cold or the flu so that your baby gets antibodies from your breast milk, which may protect them from getting sick. How do I manage the flu when I'm pregnant or breastfeeding? Most people who catch the flu start to notice symptoms about 1 to 3 days after being in contact with someone carrying the virus. If you are pregnant and think you might have the flu, you should see your doctor right away. If you are pregnant, especially if you are in your [second](/second-trimester) or [third trimester](/third-trimester), you are more likely to become seriously unwell with the flu than people who are not pregnant. If your doctor suspects you have the flu, they may take a swab from the inside of your nose and throat to confirm the diagnosis. They may also prescribe you an antiviral medicine if they are concerned about the effects of the flu on your health. This medicine is more effective the earlier you take it, so it's important to see your doctor when you first notice flu symptoms. There are also strategies you can use to relieve your symptoms while you recover. These strategies are similar to those used to treat cold symptoms. As with a cold, you should continue to [breastfeed](/breastfeeding-your-baby) your baby if you have the flu so that they get antibodies from your breast milk, which may protect them from getting sick.
