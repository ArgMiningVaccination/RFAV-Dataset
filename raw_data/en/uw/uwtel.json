We are also able to carry out many surgical procedures that your pet may require in its lifetime. Fees and Out of Hours We are an independent practice owned by four partner vets who work at the practice. We are therefore not bound by the rules and targets set by the Head Office of a corporately owned practice. We know that there are practices that offer vaccines, neutering and other services at very low prices. These are 'loss leaders', and no doubt their fees for other procedures and operations would be higher than ours. It has always been our policy to charge a fair fee for whatever we do. We do not under charge for common routine procedures such as consultations, vaccinations and neutering, therefore we do not have to make up a loss by charging more for other procedures such as dealing with illness, accidents, tumour removals, dental work and laboratory fees. Unlike many practices we do not add a \"mark-up\" to external laboratory fees. We are proud to provide our own out of hours service to our clients. All the other local practices send their clients elsewhere (e.g. Brighton or Horsham) for out of hours emergency treatment. Not only does that mean a longer journey to a different and unknown practice, but the pet's records will probably not be available. If the pet has to stay overnight arrangements must be made to transport it to the usual practice the next day. We have no doubt that these emergency providers are very good, but would you want to travel to a practice that you do not know, and maybe had never been to before, at night or on a weekend with a critically ill or injured animal? To see vets and nurses who you do not know? To have to arrange for your pet to return to your usual vet the following morning? We do not think that this is in the best interests of owners or their animals and so we are committed to continuing to provide our own out of hours service. However, the service is expensive to provide and the fees that we receive for out of hours work do not cover the costs. The service is therefore subsidised by the rest of the work that we do. Home Visiting Service We have a dedicated vet who comes out to see your pets in your own home. This is helpful especially for people with cats who get easily stressed in the vets, multiple pet households, or people with small children.. Specialist treatment We can do onsite surgery, radiography , ultrasounds,laser therapy and can arrange referrals for acupuncture, homeopathy, galen myotherapy, hydrotherapy and behavioral advice when necessary. Puppy socialisation classes We offer puppy socialisation classes to puppies who belong to registered clients, have had their first vaccination and are aged 12 weeks or under. The idea is to build on the social skills puppies have begun to learn within the litter. They need to learn about different sized dogs, temperaments and communication. The classes are also intended to be informative and fun, and it can be a good idea for the whole family along. They are run on a Thursday from 7pm to 7.45pm in our waiting room. Facilities We provide spacious, overnight accommodation for hospitalised pets. We can offer radiography, ultrasonography, ECG Laser as well as full medical and surgical facilities. We can undertake a range of laboratory work in house: to test blood samples we have Idexx biochemistry and haematology analysers, which allows us to get rapid results even at nights and weekends. It also allows us to perform pre-anaesthetic blood tests. Laparoscopic Neutering A laparoscopic spay or neuter is an alternative to the traditional method. It is less invasive and allows faster recovery time. In a laparoscopic spay, your female dog will have her ovaries removed with a camera and vessel sealing device through a keyhole incision (ovariectomy). If your dog were to have a traditional spay, this involves an operation whereby a long incision is made on the midline of the tummy. The uterus and the ovaries are stitched with thread and are removed through this larger hole. The technical name for this operation is ovariohysterectomy. The main benefits of a laparoscopic spay are less pain and a faster healing time than the traditional spay operation. The bottom line is that laparoscopic neutering is a far safer, less painful, and a more modern method. Laparoscopic surgery requires both specialist equipment and an experienced surgeon to carry out the procedure and we are thrilled to be able to offer this service here at Oathall Vets. Glossary of Terms ACUPUNCTURE- A system of complementary medicine that involves pricking the skin or tissues with needles, used to alleviate pain and to treat various physical conditions including arthritis. BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY- Identifies and treats the cause of any potential behavioral issues that your pet may be displaying. This is usually helped with the use of a treatment programme devised for the individual case. ECG- A diagnostic tool for recording the electrical activity of the heart. ECG is used to measure the rate and regularity of heartbeats, as well as the size and position of the chambers, the presence of any damage to the heart, and the effects of drugs used to regulate the heart. HOMEOPATHY- Seeks to match the symptoms of the disease with the known symptoms produced by a wide range of, usually natural, substances. It is thought to work by stimulating the patient's immune system and raising the overall level of health, enabling the patient to re-establish health and prevent disease. HYDROTHERAPY- Acts by encouraging a full range of joint motion in reduced weight bearing conditions, thus improving muscle tone and promoting tissue repair, without imposing undue stress on damaged tissues. MYOTHERAPY- The treatment of the muscles through massage. Massage is an ancient form of therapy proven to benefit particularly for still joints and muscles. It can boost a poor circulation and speed the healing process, allowing the body to relax and repair itself more efficiently. OSTEOPATHY- looks at, and treats, various conditions of the musculoskeletal system in a very 'hands-on' method. PHYSIOTHERAPY- A complementary treatment using techniques to reduce recovery time and maximise the mobility and function of the affected body part. RADIOGRAPHY- A diagnostic tool for creating images in order to identify injury or disease in animals; most commonly used for viewing dense tissue such as bone, although can also be used for soft tissue imaging. ULTRASOUND- A diagnostic tool for generating images to detect any injury or disease of the internal organs and soft tissues. LASER THERAPY - uses non-invasive laser to treat numerous injuries and wounds such as strains/sprains and can heal cuts and promotes healing post operation. "}
