Getty There are currently around 360,000 prescriptions for HRT medicines dispensed every month through the NHS. The move comes after a poll of pharmacists found most are experiencing shortages of every major type of medicine. Drugs in short supply including HRT medicines, antidepressants and pills for people living with epilepsy. The poll suggested 84 per cent of those polled were struggling to obtain HRT drugs. 402 community pharmacists responded to the Chemist and Druggist poll. Blood pressure medicine, contraceptives, painkillers and skin creams are also circulating in limited supply. The DHSC said the medicine supply chain \"is complex and highly regulated, so problems can arise for a variety of reasons, including manufacturing issues or problems with raw ingredients.\" Last month experts warned that women experiencing the menopause were experiencing profound mental health issues due to the HRT medication shortage. HRT drugs have become increasingly difficult to obtain since the end of last year, when supply issues that started in China forced some manufacturers to stop producing HRT patches. This led to heightened demand for alternatives, which then became scarce too. The situation has worsened in recent weeks. A total of 19 HRT medicines will be subject to export restrictions. The new rules are meant to stop buyers from purchasing medicines for UK patients and selling them on for a higher price in another country. Similar measures are already in place in other European countries, including France and Spain. Support free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events The UK will also restrict five more medicines, including Hepatitis B vacines and adrenaline auto-injectors. The DHSC has said there is no evidence Brexit is causing problems with drug supply. \"The decision to take precautionary measures to protect medicines supplies will be very much welcomed by our members,\" said Rick Greville, director of supply chain at the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI). \"It means that these stockpiles of medicines which companies have built over previous months are better protected and available for use only by the NHS patients for which they were intended. \"Companies can now work with the department to identify any problem areas.\" Additional reporting by agencies "}
