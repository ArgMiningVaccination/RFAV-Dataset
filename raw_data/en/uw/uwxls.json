Expert analysis on practical effects, potential risks, and more.", "sitename": "Examine", "date": "2023-05-11", "cleaned_text": "Vitamin D Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that our skin synthesizes when exposed to the sun. It benefits us in many ways, from bone health to mood. Vitamin D is most often used for Vitamin D is a fat-soluble nutrient. It is one of the 24 micronutrients critical for human survival. The sun is the major natural source through eliciting vitamin D production in the skin, but vitamin D is also found naturally in oily fish and eggs and is added to milk and milk alternatives. Supplemental vitamin D is associated with a range of benefits, including improved immune health, bone health, and well-being. Supplementation may also reduce the risk of cancer mortality, [diabetes](/conditions/type-1-diabetes/), and [multiple sclerosis](/conditions/multiple-sclerosis/). The effects of vitamin D likely depend on a person's circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D; a form of vitamin D that is measured in blood samples to determine vitamin D status), and many of its benefits will only be seen when a deficiency is reversed. Extremely high doses of vitamin D can lead to vitamin D toxicity, which causes hypercalcemia (excess calcium in the blood) and can result in [a wide variety of health problems](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557876/). Vitamin D supplementation may also have risks independent of vitamin D toxicity. A few trials on older adults have found that vitamin D increased the risk of falling, [[1]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-1) [[2]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-2) and one study observed a decrease in bone mineral density among women taking high doses of vitamin D. [[3]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-3) Vitamin D exerts its effects by binding to and activating the vitamin D receptor (VDR). VDR is located inside various cells, and its activation can lead to a change in the expression of dozens, if not hundreds, of genes. - Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) - Ergocalciferol (Vitamin D2) - Calcitriol or 1 - 25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (Hormonally active yet not directly supplemented form) The recommended daily allowance for Vitamin D is currently set at 400-800 IU/day, but this may be too low for many adults. For moderate supplementation, a 1,000-2,000 IU dose of vitamin D3 is sufficient to meet the needs of most of the population. Higher daily doses are in the range of 20-80 IU per kilogram of body weight. The [Upper Tolerable Intake Level](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56070/) in the United States and Canada is 4,000 IU per day (IU/day). It's been suggested that the true Upper Tolerable Intake Level may actually be as high as 10,000 IU/day, but there are limited data on health outcomes using doses near this amount. Vitamin D3 supplementation (cholecalciferol) is recommended over D2 supplementation (ergocalciferol) because D3 tends to raise blood levels more effectively. Vitamin D should be taken daily, with meals or a source of fat. Unlock the full potential of Examine [Get started](/plus/) Many people get depressed during the winter months, when we produce less [vitamin D](/supplements/vitamin-d/). So, can supplemental vitamin D cure seasonal depression, and maybe other types of depression? No, alas \u2014 but it may help. The [ever-popular](https://examine.com/nutrition/the-truth-about-vitamin-d/) [vitamin D](/supplements/vitamin-d/) is the \"sunshine vitamin\", [[21]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-21) and sunshine is implicated in mood. So it makes sense that researchers have intently explored vitamin D supplementation for depression \u2014 supplemental vitamin D is relatively inexpensive and safe, and may provide a variety of health benefits beside brightening your mood. But depression is complex. There are many possible causes, and no magic bullet. While you may not expect vitamin D to be a magic bullet per se, you may want to understand the current state of the evidence: what do trial results show, and how exactly exactly does vitamin D impact mood-related pathways? What does the evidence say? Two reviews of observational studies and intervention trials reached the same conclusions: When parsing the observational data, both reviews found a correlation between depression and low levels of vitamin D (20 ng/mL). When parsing the trial data, both reviews found benefit from supplementation but also low methodological quality and high risk of bias. [[22]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-22) [[23]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-23) Those two reviews were published in 2017 and 2016, so shortly after a 2015 meta-analysis of RCTs reported finding no significant reduction in depression after vitamin D supplementation. Its authors, however, mentioned that \"most of the studies focused on individuals with low levels of depression and sufficient serum vitamin D at baseline\". [[24]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-24) In other words, they didn't rule out the possibility that in people with higher levels of depression or lower levels of vitamin D, supplementation might be more effective. This hypothesis lines up with the conclusions of a 2014 meta-analysis, which found that, if one considered only the studies whose subjects had low levels of vitamin D at baseline (20 ng/mL) and were then given enough vitamin D to achieve sufficiency over the course of the trial, then supplemental vitamin D was about as effective as antidepressant medication. [[25]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-25) However, this meta-analysis did not account for publication bias. Publication bias: Studies that report that a treatment works are considered more interesting than studies that report that a treatment doesn't work. As a result, studies that report that a treatment works are more likely to get published, leading to a skewed perception of the ratio of positive to negative studies. Let's say we have 12 studies, 4 of which are positive (the treatment was found beneficial) and 8 negative (the treatment was found to have no effect, or a negative effect). The ratio of positive to negative studies is 1:2, which (if we posit the impossible: that all studies used the exact same protocol) suggests that the treatment is not, or is seldom, beneficial. But then, of the 4 positive studies, 3 get published, and of the 8 negative studies, only 1. The result is a perceived ratio of 3:1 in favor of positive studies. A 2018 meta-analysis focused on major depression and found a moderate benefit from vitamin D. However, it stresses the low number of qualifying studies (four trials) and, like the 2017 and 2016 reviews, deplores the low methodological quality of some of the studies. [[26]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-26) Finally, let's mention a 2016 RCT that found that vitamin D3 taken during late pregnancy could abate perinatal depression. [[27]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-27) It is only one trial, of course, and it focused on a specific type of depression, but it was methodologically sound, and it used only 2,000 IU/day: a dose considered safe for long-term supplementation. Note: It isn't uncommon for supplement studies to test doses too high for unsupervised use, thus limiting their real-life applicability. In the United States, the Tolerable Upper Intake (UL) for vitamin D has been set at [100 mcg/day](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56068/table/summarytables.t7/?report=objectonly), so [4,000 IU/day](https://dietarysupplementdatabase.usda.nih.gov/ingredient_calculator/equation.php). You won't likely reach this limit through foods alone, but you can easily reach it by adding a supplement. Also, you won't likely reach this limit through excessive sun exposure, since your body regulates its vitamin D production, yet one case of UVB-related hypervitaminosis D has been documented (though from tanning-bed use, not from sun exposure). [[28]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-28) Vitamin D insufficiency (20 ng/mL) has been associated with depression. If your depression is severe, you are more likely to benefit from correcting an insufficiency. If your levels of vitamin D are sufficient, however, then whether your depression is severe or not, supplementation isn't likely to help. (Due to the poor overall methodological quality of the studies, those conclusions are at best preliminary.) How does it work? Vitamin D receptors can be found pretty much everywhere in the human body, so the ways in which vitamin D might affect your mood are innumerable. One of those mechanisms could be hormonal, since vitamin D helps regulate testosterone levels [[29]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-29) [[30]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-30) and since low testosterone can impair the mood of men [[31]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-31) [[32]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-32) [[33]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-33) [[34]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-34) and women. [[35]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-35) We should remember, however, that correlation is not causation. The observational data, we said, suggests a correlation between depression and low levels of vitamin D, but that doesn't mean that low levels of vitamin D cause the depression. It might be that depressed people go outside less, thus getting less sunlight, thus producing less vitamin D: the depression would then be the cause of the low vitamin D levels, rather than its consequence. Even if depression is a consequence, not a cause, it doesn't mean that low levels of vitamin D aren't also a consequence. People who go outside less get less sunlight but also probably less exercise \u2014 and we know that exercise benefits mood, [[36]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-36) both directly and [by promoting better sleep](https://examine.com/nutrition/ten-tips-for-better-sleep/##6-exercise). And of course, a consequence can have more than one cause. For instance, a decrease in vitamin D production during the winter months is a possible factor in seasonal affective disorder (SAD), [[37]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-37) but so is a decrease in illumination, [[38]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-38) since one meta-analysis [[39]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-39) and a more recent RCT [[40]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-40) found that [light therapy](/other/light-therapy/) (using visible light, free of the UVB rays that allow your skin to produce vitamin D) can improve SAD symptoms, often as much as can pharmaceuticals. It should be noted, however, that a few trials with small sample sizes make for rather weak evidence, especially since the meta-analysis didn't account for publication bias. The findings on vitamin D are less consistent. One study found an association between depression and seasonal changes in vitamin D, [[41]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-41) but another study found no effect of supplemental vitamin D on SAD. [[42]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-42) And compounding the uncertainty, the researchers of both studies stressed that potential confounders were numerous. Low levels of vitamin D have been associated with depression, but it doesn't follow that low levels of vitamin D are the cause of the depression. They're probably one of the factors at play in seasonal depression, but so is the decrease in illumination. Who lacks vitamin D? Vitamin D insufficiency, defined as blood levels inferior or equal to 20 ng/mL, may affect as much as 50% of the population worldwide, [[21]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-21) [[43]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-43) including 41.6% of Americans. Unsurprisingly, low levels are especially common in Americans with darker skin, notably blacks (82.1%) and Hispanics (69.2%). [[44]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-44) More surprisingly, it appears that even people who live in countries with sunlight year round often don't produce enough vitamin D. [[45]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-45) This is probably due, at least in part, to most people now working indoors, leaving little skin exposed when venturing outside, and sometimes also using sunscreen. So it seems that the only way to know for sure if your vitamin D levels are sufficient is to undergo a [25-hydroxyvitamin D blood test](https://medlineplus.gov/labtests/vitamindtest.html). Assessing your vitamin D levels twice in a year \u2014 in midsummer and midwinter, when there is the most and least sunlight \u2014 is an efficient way of estimating what your levels are around the year. In Canada and the United States, the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for vitamin D falls between 400 and 800 IU (International Units). [[13]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-13) These amounts, which some researchers criticize as [inadequate](https://examine.com/nutrition/should-1000-iu-be-the-new-rda-for-vitamin-d/), [[46]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-46) [[47]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-47) can be obtained naturally from only a few [food sources](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/#h3), notably fatty fish (such as salmon, tuna, and sardines). However, in Canada and the United States, milk is often fortified with vitamin D. Since few foods are rich in vitamin D, supplementation is a valid option. Should your blood test show that your vitamin D levels are low, start [supplementing](https://examine.com/nutrition/when-should-i-take-vitamin-d/) with 2,000 IU/day (a number that, based on the available evidence, should provide the best balance of efficacy and safety), then get tested again after a couple of months. Note: D2 is not as bioavailable as D3, which means your body cannot use it as readily. Most D3 supplements are derived from lanolin, a waxy substance secreted by the skin glands of woolly animals. Sheep are sheared, then the lanolin coating is squeezed off the wool. Since the sheep are not killed in the process, this source of D3 will be acceptable to some vegetarians. For vegans, the only acceptable D3 supplement will be the more expensive Vitashine, a proprietary lichen extract. Low levels of vitamin D (found in more than 40% of Americans) have been associated with depression. Among common foods, fatty fish and fortified milk are the most notable sources of vitamin D. The bottom line It is estimated that as much as half the world, including more than 40% of Americans, have low levels of vitamin D (20 ng/mL). People with darker skin and people who seldom go unprotected under the sun are especially at risk. Low levels of vitamin D have been associated with depression. The decrease in vitamin D production caused by reduced sunlight during the winter months may be a factor in seasonal affective disorder (SAD). If your vitamin D levels are not low, supplementation isn't likely to benefit your mood. If they are low, supplementation is more likely to help if you suffer from major depression. If you suspect your vitamin D levels are low, you can have them assessed through a 25-hydroxyvitamin D blood test. Assessing your vitamin D levels twice in a year \u2014 in midsummer and midwinter, when there is the most and least sunlight \u2014 is an efficient way of estimating what your levels are around the year. Feeling down? Our science-based (just like this article) [Mood & Depression guide](https://examine.com/refer/examinecom/blogpost-vitaminddepression?loc=store/mood-depression-supplement-guide/) breaks down which supplements work and which are a waste of your time and money. When it comes to increasing your testosterone, [quality sleep](https://examine.com/nutrition/ten-tips-for-better-sleep/), physical activity, and weight management come first. A few supplements can help sustain healthy testosterone levels, but most supplements marketed as [testosterone boosters](https://examine.com/supplements/testosterone-booster/) don't work, though some can make you believe they do by boosting your libido. [Testosterone](/outcomes/testosterone/) is an androgen, a male sex hormone, though females need it too. In males, low testosterone has been associated with low libido [[48]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-48) and poor health outcomes, such as the development of metabolic syndrome. [[49]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-49) In males and females, low testosterone has been associated with depression. [[50]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-50) [[51]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-51) Middle-aged [[52]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-52) and older [[53]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-53) males see their testosterone levels decrease by 0.4% to 1.6% per year, and many are the males who experience lower-than-average levels even in their 30s. [[54]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-54) Fortunately, quality sleep, physical activity, weight management, magnesium, zinc, and vitamin D can all help sustain healthy testosterone levels. Lifestyle To optimize your testosterone levels, you don't only need [the proper amounts of vitamins and minerals](#supplements); you also need to sleep well, exercise, and keep a healthy weight. 1. Sleep Lack of sleep causes numerous [health issues](https://examine.com/nutrition/how-important-is-sleep/). Notably, it decreases testosterone production [[60]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-60) [we'll see](#weight-management) that fat gain itself can impair testosterone production). Getting enough quality sleep is so important that we will be publishing an article on that soon. 2. Physical activity Resistance training can raise testosterone levels for 15-30 minutes post-exercise. [[61]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-61) [[62]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-62) More importantly, it can benefit testosterone production in the long run by improving body composition and reducing insulin resistance. [[61]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-61) Overtraining, however, is counterproductive. Prolonged endurance exercise especially can cause your testosterone to drop. [[63]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-63) [[64]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-64) Ensuring adequate recovery time will help you receive the full benefits of physical activity. 3. Weight management Weight gain and the associated chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, [[65]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-65) [[66]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-66) [[67]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-67) are strongly linked to decreases in testosterone, particularly in middle-aged and older men. If you gain weight (as fat), your testosterone production drops. Fortunately, if you lose weight, your testosterone production can climb back up. Adapted from Grossmann and Matsumoto. J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2017. [[68]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-68) As this figure shows, observational studies have seen consistent results: in people who are overweight or obese, the greater the weight loss, the greater the testosterone increase. [[65]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-65) These results have been echoed in clinical trials. A meta-analysis of 24 RCTs looked at weight loss caused by diet or bariatric surgery: [[69]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-69) In the diet studies, the average 9.8% weight loss was linked to a testosterone increase of 2.9 nmol/L (84 ng/dL). In the bariatric-surgery studies, the average 32% weight loss was linked to a testosterone increase of 8.7 nmol/L (251 ng/dL). You need not lose huge amounts of weight to see a bump in testosterone levels, either: a 5% loss in weight can increase total testosterone by 2 nmol/L (58 ng/dL). [[70]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-70) Quality sleep, physical activity, and weight management support healthy testosterone levels, and they're synergistic: If you lack sleep, you find it harder to exercise and easier to gain fat. If you exercise, you find it easier to sleep and to keep a healthy weight. If your weight is healthy, you find it easier to exercise and easier to sleep. If you want to know more about the lifestyle-testosterone connection, check out [our infographic and article here](https://examine.com/stacks/increasing-testosterone/). Supplements Only a few supplements have been shown to benefit testosterone production. Among those, the evidence mostly supports [vitamin D](/supplements/vitamin-d/) and [zinc](/supplements/zinc/), followed by [magnesium](/supplements/magnesium/). Two caveats should be kept in mind, however: - Supplementing with a vitamin or mineral is likely to help you only if you suffer from a deficiency or an insufficiency in this vitamin or mineral. - Correcting a deficiency or an insufficiency is more likely to raise your testosterone levels if they are low. 1. Vitamin D Vitamin D helps regulate testosterone levels. [[29]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-29) [[30]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-30) Ideally, you would produce all the vitamin D you need through sunlight exposure, but if you live far from the equator, have dark skin, or simply spend most of your time inside, you may need to complement your own production with the help of foods or supplements. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations In Canada and the United States, the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for vitamin D falls between 400 and 800 IU (International Units). [[13]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-13) These amounts, which have been criticized as too low by some, [[46]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-46) [[47]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-47) are attainable from only a few [food sources](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/#h3), which is why vitamin D has become mcg | ** Adequate intake (AI) Reference: Institute of Medicine.

The National Academies Press. 2011. DOI: [10.17226/13050)](https://doi.org/10.17226/13050) 2. Zinc Zinc deficiency can hinder testosterone production. [[71]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-71) [[72]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-72) Like magnesium, zinc is lost through sweat, [[73]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-73) so athletes and other people who sweat a lot are more likely to be deficient. Although dietary zinc is mostly found in animal products, [zinc-rich foods](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Zinc-HealthProfessional/#h3) include some Reference: Institute of Medicine. [Zinc](https://www.nap.edu/read/10026/chapter/14) (chapter 12 in Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Arsenic, Boron, Chromium, Copper, Iodine, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum, Nickel, Silicon, Vanadium, and Zinc. The National Academies Press. 2001. DOI: [10.17226/10026)](https://doi.org/10.17226/10026) Consuming much more than your RDA [[74]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-74) can be harmful. In the short term, high doses can cause nausea [[75]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-75) and vomiting. [[76]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-76) In the long term, they can lead to a copper deficiency. [[77]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-77) [[78]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-78) 3. Magnesium In males with low magnesium levels and low testosterone levels, an increase in magnesium intake can translate into an increase in testosterone production, [[79]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-79) both directly and (since one of magnesium's functions in your body is to help convert vitamin D into its active form [[80]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-80)) indirectly. While more common in the older population, [[81]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-81) magnesium deficiency isn't unknown in younger people (notably athletes, [[82]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-82) since, link zinc, magnesium is lost through sweat [[73]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-73) [[83]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-83) [[84]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-84)). Yet getting your RDA should be easy: [magnesium-rich foods](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/#h3) are numerous and can Reference: Institute of Medicine. [Magnesium](https://www.nap.edu/read/5776/chapter/8) (chapter 6 in Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium, Phosphorus, Magnesium, Vitamin D, and Fluoride. The National Academies Press. 1997. [[85]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-85)) If you still feel the need to supplement, keep in mind that supplemental magnesium is more likely than dietary magnesium to cause adverse effects, which is why the FDA fixed at 350 mg the [Tolerable Upper Intake Level](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56068/table/summarytables.t8/?report=objectonly) for magnesium supplementation in adults. Also, you may want to avoid magnesium oxide: it has poor bioavailability (rats absorbed only 15% in one study, [[86]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-86) and humans only 4% in another [[87]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-87)) and can cause [intestinal discomfort and diarrhea](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601074.html). Overhyped supplements Numerous products are advertised as testosterone boosters, but the vast majority don't work, though some can make you believe they do by boosting your libido. [Maca](/supplements/maca/), for instance, can enhance libido without affecting or D-aspartate). DAA did increase testosterone levels in two studies, one that used 2.66 g/day [[92]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-92) and the other 3.12 g/day, [[93]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-93) but two later studies found no increase with 3 g/day, [[94]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-94) [[95]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-95) and the latest even noted a decrease with 6 g/day. [[94]](/supplements/vitamin-d/#ref-94) Eat a healthy, balanced diet, so as to avoid nutritional deficiencies. If your testosterone levels are low, pay attention to your intakes of [vitamin D], [zinc], and [magnesium]. Be skeptical of supplements marketed as testosterone boosters; there's a good chance the only thing these supplements will boost is their manufacturers' bottom lines. Bottom line The interventions discussed in this article will work best for men with low testosterone, but they can also help men with normal testosterone to sustain their levels, year after year. Supplements can help, but they can't replace a healthy lifestyle. In order to optimize your testosterone production, make sure you get enough quality sleep on a daily basis, incorporate some resistance training into your workout program, and monitor your weight. Try to get enough [vitamin D], [zinc], and [magnesium]through your diet. However, if dietary changes prove insufficient, supplementation can help make up the difference. Not all testosterone deficiencies can be fixed through lifestyle or supplement interventions. It may be prudent to speak with your doctor if the options discussed above do not yield sufficient results. {color=green} Ready to boost your testosterone?
