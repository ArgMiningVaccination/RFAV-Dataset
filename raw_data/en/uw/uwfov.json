We strongly recommend that EVERYONE who has received any of the vaccines and/or boosters follow this protocol. Used regularly, the GVD supplements work to help minimize the risk of severe, acute, and chronic adverse events, and the associated organ damage. We strongly recommend a minimum of 30 days, incrementing in 30 day additions depending upon how many shots and boosters you have received, after which you may continue taking any combination of the supplements at your discretion. Myocarditis & Pericarditis Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis is inflammation of the outer lining of the heart. In both cases, the body's immune system causes inflammation in response to an infection or some other trigger. Myocarditis is a major cause of sudden, unexpected death (accounting for approximately 20% of cases) in adults less than 40 years of age. Blood Clots & Thrombosis Thrombosis is the local coagulation or clotting of the blood in a part of the circulatory system. A thrombus, most commonly called a blood clot, is the final product of the blood coagulation step in hemostasis (the stopping of a flow of blood). There are two components to a thrombus: aggregated platelets and red blood cells that form a plug, and a mesh of cross-linked fibrin protein. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome & Bells Palsy Neurological side effects can occur following mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. One of those side effects is the development of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS), according to the CDC, is a rare, autoimmune disorder in which a person's own immune system attacks and damages the nerves, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis. GBS can cause symptoms that last for a few weeks to several years. Most people recover fully, but some have permanent nerve damage. Bell's Palsy is a somewhat unexplained episode of facial muscle weakness or paralysis. It begins spontaneously and escalates typically over a 48 hour period. Bell's Palsy results from damage to the 7th cranial nerve, which is the facial nerve. Pain and/or discomfort usually occur on one side of the face or head. This condition can attack anyone at any age. mRNA Spike Protein DNA Interference According to a study published online in the National Institute of Health on October 13, 2021, entitled SARS-CoV-2 Spike Impairs DNA Damage Repair and Inhibits V(D)J Recombination In Vitro: \"...by using an in vitro cell line, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein significantly inhibits DNA damage repair, which is required for effective V(D)J recombination in adaptive immunity. Mechanistically, we found that the spike protein localizes in the nucleus and inhibits DNA damage repair by impeding key DNA repair protein BRCA1 and 53BP1 recruitment to the damage site. Our findings reveal a potential molecular mechanism by which the spike protein might impede adaptive immunity and underscore the potential side effects of full-length spike-based vaccines.\" Source: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8538446/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8538446/) Heart Rx This all-natural proprietary body with nutrients such as polyphenols, flavonoids, omega-3 fatty acids, and saponins that have been scientifically proven to reverse heart inflammation, inhibit cardiovascular disease, stop heart palpitations and heart irregularities, restore normal myocardial enzyme levels, restore normal electrocardiogram readings, significantly reduce the risk of stroke, and relieve all other symptoms and complications associated with myocarditis and pericarditis, without any adverse side effects. - Increased Energy Levels - Increased Stamina - Increased Longevity - Increased Heart Strength - Increased Vascularity - Increased Immunity Deep Vein High in folate acid, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, magnesium, Potassium and melatonin, Deep Vein is our natural High Blood Pressure Solution (Hypertension) trusted proprietary blend of herbs that provides the body with essential nutrients to naturally reduce blood pressure, varicose and/or spider veins, and totally eliminate the risk of thrombosis, embolism and stroke. - Provides Folate Acid, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Magnesium, Potassium, Melatonin - Improves vascularity, nutrient delivery - Improves overall circulatory health - Improves blood flow to extremities - Improves Venous Tissue Neuroplex The electric Detox all-natural, anti-inflammatory, neuro-protective, neuro-generating, detoxifying tincture, formulated to provide the body with specific nutrients that target and eradicate pathogenic microbes and toxins within nerve cells and the entire central nervous system. Neuroplex provides nutrients that help the brain and central nervous system regenerate healthy neurons and inhibit neuronal death, preventing and reversing all neurodegenerative related conditions, including Epilepsy, Bell's Palsy, Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease. - Supports concentration and focus - Sharpens attention, reflexes - Elevates mood - Prevents Brain fog - Regenerates neurons - Improves memory & cognitive function D3 Most vitamin D3 is obtained from UVB rays from the Sun. Unfortunately UVB is unavailable during the winter months in geographical locations above 35 degrees latitude. This means most people are vitamin D deficient, and must rely on dietary intake. D3 provides all the necessary nutrients to provide the body with sufficient vitamin D3 all year round, to help maintain a strong immune system, a strong skeletal system, and avoid mental and psychological illnesses. - Provides vitamin D3 - Helps the body absorb calcium from food - Supports Strong Bones - Boosts Immune System Regulation - Helps Fight Viral Respiratory Infections - Supports Neurological Development - Supports Mental Health & Behavioral Balance Fountain Telomeres are dynamic nucleoprotein structures that protect the ends of our chromosomes from degradation, and are also critical in the activation of the DNA damage response. Telomeres are like a biological clock that plays a major role in aging and genome stability. Fountain is a powerful formula packed with all-natural, plant-based ingredients rich in nutrients that equip cells to initiate the activation of the body's telomere DNA damage repair and maintenance mechanism, increase telomere length, and reverse the aging process both internally in cells, tissue and organs, and externally in the skin. - Younger Glowing Skin - Improved Organ Function - Restored Hair Growth - Improved Eyesight - Improved Memory & Cognitive Function - Improved Energy & Libido - Improved Strength The Great Vaccine Detox Manual & Meal Plan eBook This instruction manual contains a concise yet detailed insight into all the new vaccine technologies and their well-known adverse events, and provides guidance and dietary practices to aid the sufferer in overcoming any and all symptoms associated with long or short-term vaccine injury.
