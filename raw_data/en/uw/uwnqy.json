Arbitration Agreement Our intention is to provide you with the highest level of personalized integrative care. We are committed and passionate about working with you on your path to health and healing. It is important to read all the enclosed information carefully. 1. Philosophy & Services We believe that you are the most important part of your healing. Dr. Ruelas' training is both in medicine and psychology as a result of his passion to help others. He has learned to gather and analyze clinical data differently than traditional physicians by twisting the kaleidoscope and applying different critical thinking to the use of the evidence presented. He will walk with you and traverse the view of function, health, and disease from the molecular and genomic to the psychosocial, cultural, behavioral and even spiritual path. Hopefully you will experience a breathtaking stretch of mind and consciousness. Dr. Ruelas does not see his patients purely though the lens of a dysfunctional organ system, a disease, or a syndrome, but by my evaluating a matrix of root causes in the diagnostic and therapeutic process he will help open up different ways of thinking about complex and chronic states of stress in order to restore optimal physical and mental health levels of functioning. As both a licensed psychologist and physician Dr. Ruelas is well aware of the connection between the mind and body, thus it is highly probable that he will spend time exploring aspects of both of these areas during your meeting. The most noticeable feature of his practice is the time he will spend with you. During this time he will review with you, your medical and personal history, so he will be better able to appreciate your concerns and identify the next steps to facilitate your journey. Once he has identified your challenges, he will suggest further assessment and treatment modalities that may be beneficial. From this point, he will together with you decide on follow-up options. Most of the time personal follow up appointments are necessary, though occasionally phone calls and email follow up will may be utilized. Follow up appointments are scheduled in 30 - 50 minute intervals. Integrative Medical Institute of Orange County 3 Services Integrative Medicine Integrative medicine examines many factors in the development and perpetuation of dysfunction. Dysfunctions that are not addressed and remedied in a timely manner often result in illness. By addressing the mind, body, spirit and relevant history of the patient your total health will be evaluated. We combine conventional and alternative modalities to address the biological, psychological, social and spiritual aspects of health and illness. In integrative medicine, both traditional and alternative methods of treatment are used to promote and trigger the body's innate healing response. Effective treatments that are natural and less invasive are used whenever possible. Integrative medicine takes a holistic view and neither rejects conventional medicine nor accepts alternative therapies uncritically. Beyond treatment, integrative medicine embraces the broader concepts of health promotion and the prevention of illness. Many challenges that individuals are facing are a result of imbalances or depletion of essential elements of the body. Dr. Ruelas will discuss these areas with you and develop a treatment plan to restore health, prevent illness and maintain wellness. Much of what we will do together will help to: Optimize your current health routine Prevent the development of illness, whenever possible Streamline your medication and supplement regimen Understand the underlying etiology of illness and disease Perform testing to determine additional treatment options Medical Concerns As a physician Dr. Ruelas will provide consultation utilizing conventional and alternative modalities for complex medical concerns such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, heart disease, gastrointestinal disorders, diabetes, neurological disorders, hormone imbalances and other concerns.
