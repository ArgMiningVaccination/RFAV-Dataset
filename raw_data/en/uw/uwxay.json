Currently: While some attribute this rise to increased awareness and diagnosis, Thomas Cowan, MD, argues for a direct causal relationship to a corresponding increase in the number of vaccines American children typically receiveapproximately 70 vaccine doses by age eighteen. The goal of these vaccines is precisely what we're now seeing in such abundance among our chronically ill children: the provocation of immune response. Dr. Cowan looks at emerging evidence that certain childhood illnesses are actually protective of disease later in life; examines the role of fever, the gut, and cellular fluid in immune health; argues that vaccination is an ineffective (and harmful) attempt to shortcut a complex immune response; and asserts that the medical establishment has engaged in an authoritarian argument that robs parents of informed consent. His ultimate question, from the point of view of a doctor who has decades of experience treating countless children is: What are we really doing to children when we vaccinate them? As someone with an intense family history of autoimmune diseases I was intrigued by this book, I'm only giving it two starts for the fact that the author connected vaccines/chronic illness with the asthma and hygiene hypothesis, which I think was smart of him to do; we have studied that hypothesis and it is mentioned in every book about the pathology of asthma. I also agree that overstimulating the immune system (which he presented by mentioning The Kobe university study in Japan- I still have to check that study) with the scary amounts of vaccines given today is not safe in any way. But, boy oh boy! Dr. Cowan you lost me when you started talking about genetics in such an uneducated way. I swear to God each time he mentioned genetics, epigenetics or just the word DNA he was either too wrong or someway deceptive! On page 15 he wrote: \"Some will argue that this means a disease is genetic, but the reality is certainly far more nuanced than that. It would be more accurate to say that a disease is environmental with a genetic trigger or predisposition. framing damage or disease as stemming from an environmental cause, however, would require us to do something about it. He made it look like doctors or geneticists believe that genetic diseases can only be inherited, but ask any geneticist in the world and they would tell you that most genetic diseases are indeed are a result of a complex interplay between our genes and the environment, and if anything we are trying to understand that link (the only diseases that that applies to is the single gene disorders or as we call them Mendelian disorders, and they're not the majority of genetics disorders). One other thing that was very irritating to read is the word \"I believe\", maybe because I'm used to reading scientific papers where no such language will be used. It doesn't matter what any one believes, we follow data and results. I did a quick search on pubmed and he has no published papers (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) so why should we blindly listen to what he\"believes in\", don't get me wrong he might be onto something, and something big that might save millions of lives, but seriously zero studies on pubmed? Finally, I liked one particular paragraph in the introduction where Cowan quoted Steiner \"The time will come, and it may not be far off, that people will say: It is pathological for people to even think in terms of spirit and soul. 'Sound' people will speak of nothing but the body. It will be considered a sign of illness for anyone to arrive at the idea of any such thing as a spirit or a soul.\" The big problem with Cowan's book is that the claims he makes about vaccines causing autoimmune diseases are not backed up by facts. There is strong evidence that vaccination does NOT cause autism, diabetes, allergies etc. Numerous studies have been done and can easily be found online. Cowan has authored other books in which (among other things) he alleges that the heart is not a pump, and that cancer is caused by poor structure of \"intracellular water\". This is profoundly goofy stuff. Cowan was disciplined by his state medical board in 2017 for improper care of a cancer patient. Parents should think twice before depending on him for good advice about their children's health. Update: After declaring that Covid-19 was caused by 5G networks, Cowan surrendered his medical license in 2021 and moved to the Northeast. His latest gig is running a wellness \"clinic\", which charges up to $250 a consultation, though a small family can get in on the action for $119/month plus a $150 \"activation fee\". Cowan sells a variety of supplements online, including a \"Polyrachis Ant Spagyric Tincture\" and spirits of turpentine (ingesting turpentine is one of the latest weird alt med practices to emerge, complementing the drinking of MMS (chlorine dioxide bleach) and consuming one's urine for fantasized health benefits. This book could not be more timely. The vaccine debate is sometimes a polarizing one. Pitting the Anti-Vaccers against the ones who choose to vaccinate. Cowan not only looks at the ways childhood disease has changed with the onset of vaccines which are made by companies and pushed by them and the government. Sometimes knowing they are not safe. But when there is big money to be made, we all know how the big Pharms operate. He offers a different look at the spiritual side as well. He questions the whys and hows. He asks especially why did we have a polio out break between 1916 and 11918? And those answers are extremely interesting. He speaks to autism and childhood diseases. Some which in the past have contributed to a healthy immune system. I am torn on this issue. But I believe in the right to choose your child's health plan and belong to a Vaccination PAC here in Oklahoma where we successfully passed a bill that would put that choice into the hands of the parents. And to me that is where it belongs. Wow um, so it's pretty clear to me that my chronic illnesses are from vaccines, and opioid drug use. I'm really interested in learning more about using naltrexone to heal auto immunity. He talks about how fevers and sickness actually help the body long term which was really interesting, and how vaccines are literally causing distress to the immune system, and then wondering why chronic/ autoimmune diseases are on the rise. Every parent should read this! Short, but incredibly informative and thought-provoking! This book gets a little scientific about the causes of autoimmune diseases and while I found it so fascinating, I got a little lost in the jargon in chapter six (Rethinking Cell Biology)...but the author speaks from a place of passion and education, that I want to learn more - investigate further. Part two of the book takes a deeper look into chicken pox, polio, and measles and I have to say, I was blown away by the evidence. I love books that make you think and open your eyes! And it makes so much sense. He also goes into the components of vaccines (ingredients) and discusses their \"purpose\" and associated risks. The end of the book contains references to articles, journals, etc., along with recommended resources. Overall, I thought this was a really great book that I will pass along to others...I didn't give it five stars because I didn't care for his recommended treatment protocol - probably due to my personal dietary beliefs. But I appreciated a few of his principles! Really great book. It breaks down the science of immunology, cell biology, gut flora and how all of this is affected by vaccines. It's an important book in an important time where people who choose to make any choices other than blindly following CDC guidelines are being ostracized and outcast. The science is not settled. There are valid points on both sides and everyone should be free to make the decisions they feel best suit their family. Thomas Cowan does a very good job of laying out the science behind this, as simply as can possibly be laid out for as difficult a topic. It's very readable given it's complex content. I LOVED this book!! It really rocked my world, especially chapter 3 on the immune system. It really gives you an in depth understanding of how your body works; from your immune system all the way down to your cells structure. A must read for anyone wanting to learn about vaccines or anyone that has an autoimmune disease. This was a good introductory book about looking at the connection between vaccines and the nature of autoimmune diseases. I liked how the author broke it down into parts: explaining what happens when we get sick and what it means, how our immune system works, what autoimmunity is, how vaccines impact our immune system. The part that was most eye-opening to me was his chapter on our immune system and how we have two systems: cell-mediated and humoral (you'll have to read the book for a full explanation about them). They each work in their own unique way to keep us healthy. The problem with vaccines is they only focus on one system, the humoral, which is characterised by creating antibodies. But we also need to create a cell-mediated response to clear toxins from the body. Also, his explanation of how vaccines have the potential to create autoimmune disease makes a lot of sense when you think about the only goal when administering a vaccine is to create antibodies while suppressing a cell-mediated response which is what clears the toxins of the acute illnesses from our bodies. Thus, the author asks a very important question, \"Is it so outlandish to ask whether autoimmune disease is a natural consequence of overstimulating the humoral immune response, precisely as we do when we administer a vaccine?\" Remember, autoimmune disease is characterized as an \"overstimulation\" of the immune system such that it produces an excessive amount of antibodies which then cross-react with one's own tissues, recognising them as foreign and attacking them. We live in a strange time...we claim to be so advanced in science and medicine yet we are so terrified of acute illnesses that we try to eliminate them completely, disregarding their benefits to our overall health. We ignore the studies that show that those who had certain acute illnesses are later protected against more serious health issues, such as cancer. Instead of figuring out how to support someone during an acute illness (to avoid the side effects), we try to prevent it from happening in the first place. It's like we don't trust that we have an immune system for a reason and when we don't allow it to do what it was always intended to do, it starts attacking us, hence autoimmune disease that is becoming so prevalent today. Eye opener for me--the best so far in these issues--I am grasping the critical science! I've read articles and books on vaccines, autoimmunity and other subjects related and, for the first time, I really understand many of the interconnected issues regarding the immune system and how it deals with toxins. This book is a must-read because it breaks down scientific facts in a writing style that is not too hard to grasp for somebody who has a rudimentary grasp of science, physiology, and the related issues. Tom's writing style is easy to follow and he is charitable toward all parties involved. He himself was an ER doctor and family practice doctor so he has experience on the ground. I now understand what is going on in the human body regarding these issues and many others. --Clear explanation of how there are 2 different types of immune systems. --Why going through an illness with fever produces much longer lasting immunity that vaccines ever could. --The history of polio and measles and why the vaccines were not the thing that saved us from those terrible epidemics. The importance of a healthy gut and microbiome related to quality foods and reduction of toxins. --The actual ingredients of the vaccines. --Why the vaccines will simply not work without the toxins they contain. I was amazed at the substances which we are injecting directly into our bloodstream! If we took these substances and ate them, at least our gut would have a chance to get rid of them, but when they're in our bloodstream, well, you can see why they would be issues especially with smaller children. I want to have an open mind about vaccines, so I read this book. The author is not convincing. His main line of evidence requires that we believe in his new concept of cell biology, which he does not explain in sufficient detail to evaluate scientifically. He asked the reader to trust that all cell biologists for all time have been confused about the nature of H2O, and that because there is a special \"fourth state\" of water as a gel matrix, the charges around a cell behave differently and result in problems with autoimmunity caused by vaccines. He cites the work of one cell biologist from China. I want to read the work of that scientist. But this whole perspective depends so heavily on something so strange and arcane (and poorly explained in the book) that I walk away from this feeling even more skeptical of the anti-vax movement. Which is opposite to the author's intention (he is very biased in his opinion on the matter of childhood vaccination). A few fair points mixed in with 1-person case study examples and pseudoscience. Lost credibility when on p. 53 Cowan said he didn't understand why ER patients don't come in with water pouring out of their wounds if our cells are mostly comprised of water. Also some really questionable beliefs/comments regarding the autistic community. I found it quite informative especially about autoimmune diseases, regardless if they are caused by vaccines or not (poisoning from harmful chemicals can happen in many ways e.g. pharmaceutical drugs, food, skin application, air etc) this book can be quite valuable for someone with such a disease. Dr Cowan shares personal observations, years of experience, stories of patients and suggestions on how to address and heal. One star less is due to reference to the germ theory which he debunks in his latest book, 'The Contagion Myth Why Viruses (including \"Coronavirus\") Are Not the Cause of Disease' and with I which I totally agree. Germs and especially viruses have never been proven using Koch postulates that they are the cause of any disease. I suggest anyone interest in viruses, germs and diseases to have a look at the Terrain theory, B\u00e9champ work (e.g. The Blood and its Third Element), Virus Mania and What Really Makes You Ill? books, Stefan Lanka articles and videos. This was a mixed bag for me. Some of it seems like pure common sense. There was some new information I found interesting that I want to read further on, but there were other points that I found strange or simply didn't understand. Regardless, I think he made a good overall point that \"Illness...is part of the human condition\" and agree with his conclusion that \"We have traded a temporary reduction in, in many cases innocuous childhood illnesses, for a lifetime of...chronic disease.\" (quote written down while listening to the audiobook, not double checked for accuracy). Having an autoimmune disease that has greatly impacted my life, this book was really helpful in understanding just why so many people today suffer from them as well. Dr. Cowan is a genius, a great researcher, and a rare humanitarian physician. Some of the technical science he cites is a bit tedious but necessary since it authenticates his message. Thankfully there are ways to combat autoimmunity and Cowan offers that hope in the last couple of chapters. 4.5. In my opinion, making healthcare decision as an individual or as a parent doesn't need to be a zero-sum game. This book does a great job in laying out some fundamental truths about our immune system and how the current, government-and-industry-approved healthcare system is, just maybe, pushing things on us that aren't best for the health of our children (or any of us). An interesting and thought provoking book, however when Cowan went on to discuss how certain dietary changes could be all that is needed to cure an autoimmune disease I was slightly deterred. Despite that, it was a very engaging book with a lot of ideas to think about that add to this debate of vaccination. Even though I do not agree with the writer about several things, the way the immune system is showed and talked through is fascinating. He even makes several points which leaves me questioning in the end. This proves to me the author did a great job adding a layer to the vaccine debate. I've read quite a few books on this topic and this book was different from most. Cowan takes a philosophical approach mostly. Still chock full of scientific evidence and studies etc, but mostly it makes you think. The stories of autoimmune diseases and recovery were very interesting. His solution is practical. A lot of similarities to \"The Autoimmune Fix\" by Tom O'Bryan, but I think Cowan's approach is simpler to follow and he has astounding statistics of success. Some of his water talk and recommendations (about structuring water) seem a bit hokey, but that part can't hurt to try. His point is still applicable regardless: we are mostly made of water, and it makes sense to make it a priority to get the best quality water, and with that minerals and electroytes, that we can. The discussion of childhood vaccines was short and to the point, a nice summary of the most important historical and scientific aspects. Good for someone new to the vaccine debate. This book is a very quick read, and also one I would recommend owning as a reference. I loved his emphasis on diversity in the diet, especially when it comes to plant foods. It's so easy to get stuck eating the same things over and over again, especially with today's restrictive fad diets. He recommends around 15 different plant foods on a daily basis, aiming for 60-80 different types of plant foods within the month. He recommends actually taking care to track this for at least a month, to see where you are at. Considering each plant has it's unique chemical profiles with likely medicinal qualities we may yet be unaware of, I think this is smart advice. I wish more people would read this and more doctors would research and get to the bottom of this. I am convinced Cowen is correct just based on my personal experience with an allergy that suddenly appeared in my life at the age of 26. After being administered steroids and antibiotics for more than a month, and having doctor telling me to keep taking antihistamines to keep the rashes away, I decided instinctively I did not want to have such heavy dependence on medicine. I chose to let my own immune system fight it and true enough, the rashes went away. Nonetheless, my immune system doesn't feel the same anymore. My mental state also doesn't feel the same anymore. Overall interesting theory on why we had past disease outbreaks, and how our response with a vaccine is the reason for an increase in autoimmune diseases. As an MD myself, I felt that the book lacked scientific detail... but I get that the general public might feel overwhelmed with that topic. I skipped most of the \"treatment\" section because I have heard of using those tools before many many times (i.e. the treatment was nothing new and you can read it in tons of other books.) That said, I feel that as a now reflexologist that I have plenty of clients that could benefit from dietary changes + low-dose naltrexone. Now I just have to find a doctor around here to refer clients to. That always seems to be the problem when reading health-related books. WHO can you even go to to oversee these alternative protocols? Not easy in Michigan, I can tell you that. :( Incredibly helpful book for understanding how the immune system works on an easier to read level for a non-medical professional ;). Though still above my head enough to make me really think. Also a great read for anyone who suffers from or knows someone who suffers from an autoimmune disease. And finally, helpful in understanding how vaccines are supposed to stimulate immune response and the potential effects of them longer term. Another \"not sure what to make of this guy\" book... I appreciated his history of the polio, varicella, and MMR vaccines, strategic points in the final chapter on America's unfortunate economic dependence on the allopathic medicine model, good overview in the appendices of the most common vaccine ingredients, and resources for further exploration. His ideas on energy and water, etc. are a bit out there and I can see how some dismiss/discredit him as a whole. This book is absolutely incredible. This is the kind of book that every medical student needs to read, re-read, and start a book-reading club with just to read more times with others. It's straightforward, informative, thoroughly documented with medical research, and actually enjoyable to read in style. Alternative view of the rise of chronic and autoimmune diseases as a consequence of vaccination itself as a strategy and the various toxic additions to vaccines put there to provoke the immune reaction. 3 1/2 stars.
