We produce the purest, most potent single ingredient remedies available. It is our core purpose to further the integrity and acceptance of homeopathy as a viable, respected medical modality by supplying the world with reliable homeopathic remedies. Be sure to watch our story below: \"The highest ideal of cure is rapid, gentle and permanent restoration of the health, or removal and annihilation of the disease in its whole extent, in the shortest, most reliable, and most harmless way, on easily comprehensible principles.\" Organon of Medicine, 6th edition Dr. Samuel Hahnemann Founder of Homeopathy 1.888.427.6422 Hahnemann Labs is the leading homeopathy pharmacy in the United States. They carry almost all remedies in whatever potency one could need (LM potencies too). Whole Foods, Pharmaca, and other health stores only carry certain remedies, in limited potencies and typically from large commercial manufacturers of homeopathic products like Boiron and Heel. Boiron is alright in a pinch, but it's not the same as Hahnemann Labs. I have bought my remedies from Hahnemann Laboratories for years, and long before I moved to the Bay Area, when I lived on the East Coast.SalsaBoy S. Oakland, CA Hahnemann is the go to place for homeopathic remedies that you can't find easily. Helpful, essential. Thank you- a real resource.I W. San Francisco, CA I recently ordered from Hahnemann Labs for the first time. I was so pleased with the experience. Even though the website is extremely helpful, I did have a question I needed to ask before placing my order. The staff was pleasant friendly and knowledgeable. The package was shipped and arrived very quickly. I really liked the personal touches of ordering with Hahnemann, especially knowing I could contact the labs to ask questions. I will certainly order from Hahnemann again!Ellen J., Joshua Tree, CA I have depended on Hahnemann Pharmacy for over decade for my patient supply. Fast service and quality, as well as larger quantities that make economic sense. I would recommend them for all your homeopathic needs.Leonard R.
