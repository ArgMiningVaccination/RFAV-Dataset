You've probably said it yourself: \"If only I had more time. . .\" Here at Emory's Woodruff Health Sciences Center, we feel much the same way. We're working 24 hours a day, seven days a week toward a healthier world through research, education, and patient care. But if there were more hours in a day, more days in a week, we could do even more\u2014because the fact is, there's nothing we'd rather be doing. Making and keeping people healthy is both our vocation and our passion. From the health professionals who work tirelessly to heal the sick and to keep the rest healthy, to the educators who create innovative programs across the breadth of the health sciences, to the trail-blazing scientists who work to prevent disease before it even starts, the Woodruff Health Sciences Center is dedicated\u2014all day, every day\u2014to the people we serve. The stories in this year's Community Benefits Report represent just a few examples among the thousands we see each year. If only we could have eight days a week to do even more we gladly would, because making people healthy is always on our mind. Jonathan S.

It also includes catastrophic care for patients who may have some coverage but for whom health care bills are so large relative to their financial situation that paying them would be permanently life-shattering. The box below details the charity care provided at individual Emory Healthcare facilities. Included elsewhere in this book are amounts of uncompensated care provided by Emory physicians who practice at Grady Memorial Hospital and at other hospitals and clinics where many volunteer during their free time. In addition to charity care, Emory Healthcare provides many other services to help improve access to care, advance medical knowledge, and relieve or reduce dependence on taxpayer-funded community efforts. In fiscal year 2015-2016, this total for Emory Healthcare was $52,538,139. Examples of what this total includes follow: n $7 ,793,669 from the community benefit inventory for social accountability (CBISA). Significant CBISA dollars include activities such as discounted/free prescription drug programs; programs and contracted services for indigent patients; in-kind donations to organizations such as MedShare; transportation services; flu shots; blood drives; subsidized continuing care, nursing home care, and home care; sponsorship of selected charity health awareness events; and educational programs for the public, future health professionals, and patients n $19,391,929 shortfall between Emory Healthcare's cost to provide care to Medicaid patients and the Medicaid reimbursement n $25,352,541 costs to Emory Healthcare for the Georgia provider tax, which supports the Medicaid budget and helps maintain pay-ment levels for all Medicaid providersSUN MON TUES WED THURS FRI SAT 1 2 3 5 6 7 7 8 9 10 12 13 14 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 COMMUNITY BENEFITS REPORT n 2016 5 4 WOODRUFF HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER WHEN HIS BROTHER GOT SICK, 52-YEAR-OLD HAROLD FRENCH CAME TO ATLANTA TO HELP OUT FOR A FEW WEEKS. THEN, WHILE MOWING HIS BROTHER'S LAWN, HE SUFFERED A MASSIVE STROKE. At Emory University Hospital, neurosurgeon Jon Willie removed a piece of French's skull to give his damaged brain more room to heal. Once he was medically stable, French was moved to the neuro- science floor. Stroke patients need to begin rehab as soon as possible, but French was unusually uncooperative. When therapists arrived, he turned his head to the wall or shook his fist and shouted incoherently. Neuroscience social worker Hannah Hamby held multiple conference calls with French's family to discuss long- term placement in a skilled nursing facility closer to their home, as they wanted. Some facilities expressed inter - est\u2014until they learned of French's unwillingness to participate in his care. Neurosurgeon Willie recognized what was happening. Absence of the piece of skull removed to relieve swelling was now causing the brain and scalp to sink, result-ing in further mental deterioration. When French was well enough, Willie took the bone flap from the freezer where it had been stored and fused it back into French's skull, restoring the original contour of the head. The change in French was quick and positive, and he began to work with his therapists. After four weeks, he made enough gains to be transferred to Emory Rehabilitation Hospital. After three more weeks of rehab, he was able to feed himself and perform other tasks of daily living. Now, instead of going to a long-term care facility, he could head home with his family. As French prepared to leave, Hamby helped arrange transportation, a medical escort, and donation of a specialized wheelchair. Emory provided enough medicines to cover him until his family enrolled in Medicaid. French still has a long way to go, but four months of uncompensated care have given him a good start. A good start French was stuck. He wouldn't accept rehab, and he couldn't remain indefinitely on the neuroscience floor.Day 1: EMORY UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL Neurosurgeon Jon Willie recog - nized the cause of French's inability to participate in his own recovery.

The damage caused inflammation across his spinal cord, first weakening and then paralyz- ing his legs. It also caused an infection that refused to respond to antibiotic infusions. Surgeons cut away bone and tissue around the affected area, but the infection was relentless. Stopping it would require more specialized expertise. Smith was referred to Emory University Hospital Midtown and orthopaedic oncology surgeon Nickolas Reimer. Reimer performed a hemipelvectomy, which required removing the affect- ed pelvic bones and one leg. He used the patient's thigh tissue as a pedicle flap to cover the defect created by the infection and sealed the wound with a vacuum-assisted closure device that drew out fluid, irrigated the wound with antibiotics, and encouraged blood flow and healing. After three weeks in the hospital, Smith was eager to go home. Planning for his discharge, social worker Alyssa Mellor helped connect the family with local home health care nurses and a local infusion doc- tor to continue antibiotics for five more weeks. But there was a problem. Medicaid wouldn't cover the more expensive of the two antibiotics that his doctors insisted he needed. Having spent almost every night at the hospital with her son, his mother had lost her job and the family's health insurance. With her husband disabled, pay- ing her son's medical bills was impossible. The hospital used its charity funds to cover the needed medicine. Before his aggressive surgery and anti- biotic treatment, Smith had been mostly confined to his home after his injury. At his most recent return visit to Emory Midtown, he told doctors proudly that he was making plans to go back to school. There was a diploma in his future, he said, and maybe even a party or two with old friends. Making plans for the future Day 2: EMORY UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL MIDTOWN In his experience with damage caused by tumors in the mus- culoskeletal system, the surgeon had dealt with problems like this teenager's before. Orthopaedic social worker Alyssa Mellor helped work out a plan when one of the needed antibiotics was not covered by Medicaid.

HE HAD SMILED, GIVEN HER A HUG, AND TOOK OVER GETTING FIVE-YEAR OLD DAUGHTER ZARIA READY FOR SCHOOL. THEN JORDAN-DENNIS COLLAPSED. The first ambulance got her to a nearby hospital, where doctors recog- nized that blood was hemorrhaging into her brain, destroying vital tissue. She was airlifted to Emory University Hospital and its experts in aneurysms. Following brain surgery, Jordan-Dennis remained unconscious in Emory's neuro-ICU for more than a month. When she came to, she tried to say, \"I want to go home,\" but no words came out. She was moved across the street to Emory Rehabilitation Hospital. Over the next days, as her mind cleared, she grew determined. Her own mother had suffered an aneurysm in her early 30s, leaving Jordan-Dennis motherless at the same age as Zaria. I'm not going to do that to my little girl, she thought. I'll do what-ever it takes to go home. And she did. For more than a month, she met daily with physiatrist Samuel Milton. Therapists\u2014physical, occupational, speech, and recreational\u2014each worked with her for at least an hour six days a week. Although both she and husband Letron had full-time jobs, she in prekindergar - ten, he as a forklift operator, they had no insurance. Emory Rehabilitation Hospital, like Emory University Hospital, wrote off tens of thousands of dollars in costs. Two months after her collapse, Jordan-Dennis was able to go home, returning to Emory Rehab's outpatient center several days a week, her father, husband, and sister chang-ing their work schedules to bring her. One day before she was discharged from care in April, she brought her daughter with her. Zaria told friends she went to see the place where her mother \"worked.\" It's hard work that is paying off.

She wanted Winship to get a medical visa for her brother, Jacques Bonnell, who lived in Haiti. When told that Emory would see him once he arrived but could do no more without records, she always began weeping. Then, somehow, months later, she appeared with her brother. True to Watson's word, Winship saw him imme- diately. Blood tests confirmed the diagnosis. Multiple myeloma cells were crowding out healthy blood-forming cells in his bone marrow. The thin, drawn man in his mid-30s was exhausted from frequent infections, nau-sea, and bone pain. A cancer of the plasma cells, multiple myeloma can't be cured. But the right medical care, provided at the right time, can relieve symptoms and slow its progress. Sagar Lonial and his colleagues at Winship see more than 1,600 multiple myeloma patients every year, follow-ing many for years. They knew this man, as sick as he was, had a chance for remission. There was no discus-sion of how the family would pay for the care. Because the disease was so advanced, Lonial decided the best option was a stem cell transplant. Bonnell's own stem cells would be removed from his blood and returned after high doses of che-motherapy had killed his cancer cells. The transplant worked to decrease the myeloma cells, but the man faced other problems, likely caused by treatment received before coming to the states: congestive heart failure, spinal fracture, and kidney failure necessitating dialysis. Time and time again, he returned to Emory's ICU, sometimes for weeks. Although a pharmaceutical company provides his medicines, Winship so far has absorbed more than $1 million in other costs for care. Despite what they've been through, says Watson, Bonnell and his sister's determi- nation and courage have never failed. They continue to radiate joy and gratitude for the care he has received from Winship.

IT HAD TO BE PAINFUL, BUT HE SEEMED NOT TO NOTICE. Gradually, the health care team pieced together his medical history. He had been treated at Grady Hospital for AIDS but had stopped taking his medicines, his condi- tion deteriorating rapidly. With no one to turn to, he had simply given up. Over the next few weeks at Emory Saint Joseph's, however, he emerged Lazarus-like from his debility and despondency. Part of the credit belongs to the array of medicines pre- scribed by infectious disease physician Ronald Trible. But the emotional support he received was also a big factor. When Salim was at his lowest, social worker Lindsey Parrish and physician Sherika Newman provided palliative care\u2014and lots of personal attention. In fact, the hospital paid for around-the-clock sitters to ease his sense of isolation. As the patient recovered, Trible spent time asking about life in Salim's native Senegal. When Salim only picked at his food, staff began to cook dishes similar to what he described so nostalgically. When he was well enough to leave hospital care, case manager Mary Looney worked on a discharge plan. Salim had no money, and an expired tourist visa meant he was inel-igible for Medicaid. Having covered six weeks of hospital care, the hospital now paid for another two months at Emory's Budd Terrace for rehabili-tation, and Looney organized wheelchair and walker donations as well as appoint- ments at Grady's Ponce Center for AIDS patients. Eventually, he was well enough to move to the Living Room, a nonprofit that works to prevent homelessness for people with HIV/AIDS. There, another case manager helped him find permanent housing and work to support himself. He wants it. He has rediscovered the will to live. Taking extra steps Day 5: EMORY SAINT JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL Salim seemingly had no one to turn to until he arrived at the hospital, where good medicine and loving care helped him regain the will to live.

For more than two years since his stroke, his wife had been doing her best to care for him, but she had serious issues of her own. Brown was not in good shape. His thinking was confused, his body weak. He had a large, painful bedsore and a staph infection (MRSA) resistant to most antibiotics. Adult Protective Services would not allow him to return home. Soon there was no home he could have gone to, with utili- ties shut down, furniture on the street, and his wife dealing with her own exacerbated problems and com-pletely out of his life. Emory Johns Creek's infectious disease specialists quickly got the staph infection under control. Under the care of the wound care team, the bedsore began to shrink. Other general health issues also resolved. The more difficult work was tracking down documents that had scattered to the wind after Brown's stroke and his wife's eviction. Friends from his religious community said the Caribbean native had become a citizen in the 1970s and served in the U.S. military. The Veterans Administration paid for his initial hospital stay, but a small minority of soldiers serve with green cards, and documentation of citizenship has to come from the State Department. Unable to get results on their own, hospital administrators paid for a state-appointed financial conservator to try, but she was unsuccessful. The VA stopped paying his costs when hospitalization was deemed no longer medically necessary. His doctors agreed, but where would he go? Without proof of citizenship, he was ineligible for Medicaid or Medicare, and no long-term care facility would accept him without some kind of reimbursement. Brown had become the hos-pital's responsibility, both physically and financially. With the exception of the short period covered by the VA, Emory Johns Creek covered all costs of his hospitalization for more than a year. Last spring, the hospital made arrangements\u2014and agreed to pay the cost\u2014for him to be cared for at Budd Terrace, Emory Healthcare's 250-bed facility for skilled nursing care. There he continues to get care, still without reimburse- ment, and new caregivers have joined his adoptive family.Filling in the gaps Day 6: EMORY JOHNS CREEK HOSPITAL As Brown's stay stretched on, staff adopted him as fam- ily, taking him outside for fresh air, cutting his hair, and bringing him audio books.Nurse Janelle Dees with a wound care patient at Emory Johns Creek Hospital Nurse Janelle Dees (at right with a patient) was one of a large team of caregivers and social services staff who helped resolve Brown's life- threatening conditions and took steps to help lift his spirits as well.

Only Kara was hit. By the time orthopaedic sur - geon William Reisman arrived at the Grady ER two hours later, the young woman had been stabilized by general surgeons. They stepped back from the table to let Reisman assess the damage. The impact had fractured Kara's tibia and pulled her pelvis apart like a turkey wishbone. The surgeons had cleaned the large open wound and performed a temporary colostomy to prevent bowel contamination. Reisman began work. He fitted pins into the young woman's shin and pelvic bones, then connected them to an external frame. This would hold the bones in position until the following day when he would rebuild the shattered pelvis with metal rods, plates, and screws. Two days after this second surgery, a clot developed in a blood vessel severely damaged by the impact. Reisman called in his vascular surgery colleagues to remove the clot, but the vessel was too damaged. The surgeons looked at each other over their masks. Without blood carrying oxygen to the lower leg, tissue would die. Reisman had feared this. He would have to amputate. He waited until Kara was conscious to explain what he needed to do\u2014and to promise he would do everything he could to save her knee. That would make using a prosthesis much easier. A week later, after three surgeries to remove the tissue that died each night, Reisman was able to close the gaping wound with a skin graft. Two weeks later, Kara left Grady in a wheelchair. Reisman never knew if he, his colleagues, or the hospital were paid. He only knew, because she told him, that she couldn't get her prosthesis until her application for Medicaid was approved. He saw her regularly over the next year, checking how her bones were healing and changing hardware as needed. In these visits, still ongoing, a smiling Kara keeps him updated on her life. After finishing college, she found a job in health care. She got interested, she said, because of her own firsthand experience.Emory faculty pro- vided $27 .1 million in uncompensated care at Grady in fiscal year 2015-2016. All payments for Emory services for patients who do have some cover - age go to the Emory Medical Care Foundation, which uses this revenue\u2014$46 million last year\u2014to support Emory's mission at Grady.

Fogginess, confusion, forgetting to turn off the stove. Tyor had seen it too many times before. The number of cases of HIV-associated dementia dropped markedly with the arrival of powerful antiretroviral drugs that reduce viral load, restore immune response, and result in longer, healthier lives. But these drugs don't halt neurocogni-tive impairment found in 40% or more of people living with HIV. Jenkins's disorder had progressed to the point where he could no longer be left alone. For the past 30 years, since AIDS first appeared on the scene, Tyor has investi- gated what causes these problems. In the body, HIV destroys infection-fighting white blood cells and thus lowers the immune response. When the virus enters the brain, however, HIV infects micro-glial cells that fight infections in the brain, distorting the cells in a way that raises the immune response. This results in inflammation, which can destroy neu-rons essential to cognition and memory. The usual antiretroviral drugs don't eradicate the virus from the brain and thus don't fight the inflammation. Different medicines are needed for that. After developing a genetically altered mouse model of the HIV-related cognition dysfunction seen in humans, Tyor began testing numerous com- pounds until he found one that reduces inflammation and slows disease progression. In fact, it seemed to reverse memory problems in mice that received the compound early in the disease process, perhaps before too many neurons died. Tyor hopes patients like Jenkins might benefit from the new compound. He and Emory colleagues are preparing for a clinical trial in humans. With the largest popula-tion of HIV/AIDS patients of any VAMC in the country, the Atlanta facility is a great research partner for this effort, and its patients will be the first to potentially benefit. Research is about to take a big step forward in the battle against memory and thinking problems experienced by so many patients with HIV .Fighting hidden challenges Day 8: ATLANTA VETERANS AFFAIRS MEDICAL CENTER Last spring, Emory's Veterans Program formally opened a new intensive outpatient treatment program for post- 9/11 veterans, which aims to reduce symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, while helping veterans re- engage in daily life. The partnership between Emory and the Atlanta VA Medical Center dates back to 1946. Emory provides virtually all phy- sician care at the facility and has made it one of the nation's most successful VA centers for research to continually improve care. Emory investigators con- tribute to a diverse spectrum of research at the Atlanta VA that brought in more than $14 mil-lion in VA and $12.5 million in non-VA funding last year. Neurologist William Tyor developed a genetically altered mouse model of the HIV-related cognition dysfunction seen in humans.

For example, faculty in Emory School of Medicine are partnering with faculty at Georgia Tech to create new bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree programs and con-centrations in health care robotics\u2014the first degree programs in this area in the United States. They are supported in this effort by a five-year grant from the National Science Foundation. In addition, the school's emergency medicine department received funding through the federal Ebola Biosafety and Infectious Disease Response Training program to help train first responders and other workers at risk for exposure to infectious disease to protect themselves and prevent disease spread. The Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing recently revised its curricula for both bachelor's and master's students to focus on continuum of care across the lifespan, from childhood to old age, with a new emphasis on palliative care. The school also introduced executive online courses for MSN degrees in several acute care specialties, including the Neonatal Nurse Practitioner program, the only such program in Georgia. At the Rollins School of Public Health, students are out in front of the increasing need for mobile health applications, leading the Rollins mHealth Collaboration to teach fellow students how to develop mobile applications with a variety of uses, ranging from acquisi-tion of data for research to disseminating education and interventional outreach to at-risk populations. The school also recently added Genetic and Molecular Epidemiology to its growing list of certification programs, and the enrollment cap for the prerequisite course for the new program had to be increased twice to accommodate student demand.Students and trainees in health sciences: Emory University School of Medicine n 575 medical students, including 93 MD/PhD students n 1,266 residents and fellows n 509 students in allied health training, such as physical therapy and physician assistant programs Rollins School of Public Health n 1,140 master's and 189 PhD students Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing n 374 bachelor's, 236 master's, 34 PhD students, 21 DNP students Emory Healthcare provided $62.7 million to support teach- ing and research missions in the Woodruff Health Sciences Center in fiscal year 2015-2016. The Woodruff Health Sciences Center invested 24.9% of its tuition income last year in fi-nancial aid for its students, an amount totaling $26.4 million. Providing the infrastructure for research Training for today and tomorrowRESEARCH EDUCATION The Woodruff Health Sci - ences Center invested a total of $112.8 million in research costs unrecovered from sponsors last year. Some Emory research high - lights from the past year: Launched an antibiotic resistance center to identify and consolidate expertise on this increasingly urgent issue Assembled teams to study Zika and develop a vaccine and drugs against it Launched largest-ever clinical research study in Atlanta, on brain health Partnered with Georgia Tech and others to create a new Regional Big Data Hub to address regional challenges in health care and other areas Offered patients access to more than 900 clinical research studies of new drugs and devices Emory's nursing curricula focuses on the continuum of care across the lifespan, from birth to old age. INVESTIGATORS IN MEDICINE, NURSING, PUBLIC HEALTH, AND YERKES NATIONAL PRIMATE RESEARCH CENTER GAR-NERED MORE THAN $540 MILLION IN RESEARCH AWARDS IN FISCAL YEAR 2015-2016, many of these with international, national, and local partners, such as Georgia Tech and University of Georgia. This research total included a $35.6 million grant to lead a multidisciplinary consortium focused on HIV vaccine and cure research; $9.7 million to develop drugs to treat emerging and man-made viral threats; $8.9 million to explore strategies to prevent atherosclerosis and aortic aneurysms; $8.3 million to establish a laboratory in a national network of laboratories to measure the impact of environmental chemicals on children's health; $6.4 million to develop better treatments for malaria; $5.2 million to study links between blood pressure regulation and Alzheimer's; $5 million to study interactions between toxicant exposures and the micro- biome and their impact on preterm birth, infant health, and neurodevelopment among African American mothers and babies; $2.8 million to develop nanoparticles to treat pan-creatic cancer; $2.4 million to develop a breast cancer vaccine; and $2.2 million to prevent the spread of infectious disease in health care facilities, among others. These grants and contracts move research forward to benefit society and create thou- sands of jobs. This research would not be possible, however, without facilties and other infrastructure support provided by the Woodruff Health Sciences Center. In fiscal year 2016, for example, the WHSC invested $112.8 million in research-support costs unrecov-ered from sponsors.

The WHSC also fuels thousands of additional jobs locally through millions of dollars each year in research grants (see page 24), new construction, and part-nerships with collaborators in research, teaching, and patient care. For example, Emory recently purchased 60 acres of property at Executive Park, which is already home to Emory's Orthopaedics & Spine Clinic and Brain Health Center. Soon after, Emory Healthcare and the Atlanta Hawks announced plans to partner and build a privately funded, 90,000-square-foot sports medicine and training facility, which broke ground this past summer. Emory Healthcare also held a recent \"topping out\" ceremony for a $400 million, 450,000-square-foot addition to Emory University Hospital. The building will add more than 500 new jobs for nursing staff, radiologic and surgical technologists, and many other hospital staff once it opens in 2017. The WHSC has an estimated economic impact on the metro area of $7.5 billion, based on $3.8 billion in expenditures for FY 2015-2016.

The reports assess the needs of the communities served by the hospitals using quantitative data and input from individuals representing the broad interest of the communities. Using the CHNAs, Emory Healthcare develops strategies to outline plans to address the identified health needs of the communities it serves. Through these strategies, Emory Healthcare strives to improve the overall health of communities, while providing the best possible care to its patients. This includes the following: n Discounted/free prescription drug programs; programs and contracted services for indigent patients; in-kind donations to organizations such as MedShare; transportation services; flu shots; blood drives; subsidized continuing care, nursing home care, and home care; sponsorship of selected charity health aware- ness events; and educational programs for the public, future health professionals, and patients $7,793,669 n Shortfall between Emory Healthcare's cost to provide care to Medicaid patients and reimbursement from Medicaid $19,391,929 n Costs to Emory Healthcare for the Georgia provider tax, which supports the Medicaid budget and helps maintain payment levels for all Medicaid providers $25,352,541 Note: Statistics and information in this report are intended to augment rather than supplant the information required and the metrics used for the Schedules H of the Forms 990 filed with the Internal Revenue Service that include information on Emory University Hospital, Emory University Hospital Midtown, Emory University Hospital at Wesley Woods, Emory University Hospital at Wesley Woods Long-Term Hospital, Emory Saint Joseph's Hospital, and Emory Johns Creek Hospital.
