Categories of Healthcare Waste Sharps waste Infectious waste Pathological waste Pharmaceutical or cytotoxic waste Chemical waste Radioactive waste Non-hazardous/general waste Examples of Healthcare Waste Department Sharps Infectious and pathological waste Chemical, pharmaceutical and cytotoxic waste Non-hazardous or general waste Medical ward Hypodermic needles, intravenous set needles; broken vials and ampoules Dressings, bandages, gauze, and cotton contaminated with blood or body fluids; gloves and masks contaminated with blood of body fluids Broken thermometers and blood pressure gauges; split medicines; spend disinfectants Packaging, food scraps, paper, flowers, empty saline bottles, non -bloody diapers; non -bloody IV tubing and bags Operating theatre Needles, IV sets, scalpels, blades, saws Blood and other body fluids; suction canisters; gowns, gloves, masks, gauze, and other waste contaminated with blood and body fluids; tissues, organs, foetuses , body parts Spent disinfectants Packaging, uncontaminated gowns, gloves, masks, hats and shoe covers Laboratory Needles; broken glass, Petri dishes, slides and cover slips; broken pipettes Blood and body fluids; microbiological cultures and stocks; tissue; infected animal carcasses; tubes and containers contaminated with blood or body fluid Fixatives; formalin; xylene, toluene, methanol, methylene chloride, and other solvents; broken lab thermometers Packaging; paper, plastic containers Pharmacy store Broken bottles, broken thermometers Expired drugs, Spilled drugs Empty containers Packaging; paper, empty containers Radiology Silver; fixing and developing solutions; acetic acid; glutaraldehyde Chemotherapy Needles and syringes Bulk chemotherapeutic waste; vials, gloves and other material contaminated with cytotoxic agents; contaminated excreta and urine.

Give some examples of healthcare wastes from these sources. How does your facility deal with the major categories of healthcare wastes (sharps, chemical, etc.)? Do you know of any interventions that can reduce exposure to healthcare wastes? Can you site some examples of mismanagement of wastes in your facility? If so, what can you "}
