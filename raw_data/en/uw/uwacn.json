When construction of the new home for the University of Houston College of Pharmacy began in July 2015, it was a historic moment because the need for a new state-of-the-art pharmacy facility had been discussed for many years. While it has taken a long time to become a reality, it will be well worth the wait and will be a fabulous addition to the UH Health Science Center and our regional healthcare initiatives. We already have phenomenal researchers in our college who are working on new discoveries to combat today's illnesses. However, these new first-rate facilities and expanded core research laboratories with new specialized research equipment will enable us to expand that important research and enable our researchers to better explore new frontiers in drug discovery and development. Our new state-of-the-art classrooms will allow our faculty to utilize the latest and most effective teaching pedagogies, such as team-based/active learning approaches, that will also allow us to offer new and unique educational programs which will ultimately enhance our practice of pharmacy throughout the region, nation and world. We will be able to better meet the ever-changing needs of our healthcare system and our communities. A key centerpiece of the new building will be a new expanded state-of-the-art Pharmacy Care Laboratory that will allow students to begin pragmatic \"hands-on\" training immediately upon entry into the professional program. This new approach will allow students to begin to assimilate knowledge and principles, in a pragmatic and applied manner, much earlier in the curriculum. Simulations will also be used to a greater degree which will better prepare our students before more advanced \"live-patient\" rotations begin. The workstation capacity in our Pharmacy Care Laboratory will greatly increase. We will have an enhanced simulated community pharmacy that will allow our students to design and operationalize such important principles as workflow design, patient counseling methodologies, inventory control, personnel management, enhanced OTC counseling, etc. We will also have a patient assessment/education area, hospital IV admixture/sterile products room, an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) suite complete with mock hospital and ambulatory care rooms featuring computerized mannequins and simulated patients, and a group demonstration area. We truly expect that these curricular and facility improvements will continue to enhance \"our UHCOP home\" and the abilities of our students upon graduation. This will translate into enhanced pharmaceutical care for the citizens of the great state of Texas and beyond. Best wishes, F.

Bauer College of Business are partnering to offer a Pharm.D./Master of Business Administration dual degree program that prepares students to effectively alternate between the examination room and the board room. The program will allow students to complete the requirements of both programs in less time than it would by pursuing them separately. Program eligibility is open to both applicants to the UHCOP Pharm.D. degree program as well as currently enrolled Pharm.D. students before the end of their P1 year. \"Our Pharm.D. curriculum already provides a solid, high- quality foundation in such areas as pharmacy management and operations, but the Pharm.D./MBA dual degree offers students the opportunity to take that knowledge to the next level,\" said F. Lamar Pritchard, Ph.D., R.Ph. \"As organizations, pharmacy departments and pharmacists themselves are becoming more accountable for measurable outcomes \u2014 not only for the health of our patients \u2014 but also for the overall health of the enterprise, regardless if it's a for- or non-profit organization. \"The Bauer MBA program's robust curriculum in such areas as entrepreneurship, project management and marketing will undoubtedly position our dual degree graduates for success, whether they're starting an independent pharmacy, helping identify and implement operational efficiencies in virtually any practice setting, or seeking an executive C-suite position in a healthcare organization.\" The dual degree option builds on the strengths of two programs ranked in the top 50 nationwide among their respective disciplines by U.S. News & World Report. \"The tremendous scientific advances happening in healthcare present challenges to the resource allocation and delivery mechanisms in pharmaceutical therapies and in medicine,\" said Bauer College of Business Dean Latha Ramchand, Ph.D. \"Addressing those challenges will require leaders whose competence in business is as deep as their scientific expertise. Bauer College is pleased to partner with the College of Pharmacy to offer this program to the next generation of healthcare leaders in pharmacy.\" As common with dual degree programs, a limited number of credit hours within the component programs will count toward fulfillment of the academic requirements of the other program. Under the current plan, 12 Pharm.D. credit hours will count as elective hours in the 48-hour MBA program and six hours of the MBA program will count as elective hours in the 146-hour Pharm.D. program.

University of Houston College of Pharmacy 7Self-Study Paves Way for ACPE Site Visit National accreditation is the cornerstone for all Pharm.D. programs in the U.S., and UH College of Pharmacy is proud to have maintained continuous accreditation by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) since 1950 \u2014 only days before the college's first graduates were to sit for their board exams. The college's administration, faculty, staff, students and alumni have been hard at work on the Self-Study Report in preparation of the ACPE evaluation team's site visit in March 2017. The college will be among the first programs evaluated under the ACPE's Standards 2016, which went into effect in July 2016. According to ACPE, \"Standards 2016 are employed for quality assurance so graduates of pharmacy education programs are practice-ready and team-ready and therefore, prepared to directly provide patient care in collaboration with other healthcare providers. Standards 2016 articulate the expectations of ACPE, the academy, the practice community, and the U.S. Department of Education and are solidly based on evidence and experience.\" ACPE Standards 2016 has three major domains: Educational Outcomes, Structure and Process, and Assessment. Educational Outcomes include objectives for foundational knowledge, essentials for practice and care, approach to practice and care, and personal and professional development. Structure and Process comprises the college's planning and organization, integration of the education program (didactic, interprofessional education, IPPE, and APPE), students, and resources (preceptors). The Assessment component allows for the college to review and evaluate set goals as it relates to the other domains. The UHCOP Self-Study Report is posted to the college's website at http:/ /tinyurl.com/uhcop-acpe.Countdown to Re-accreditation January 2015 ACPE Releases Final Accreditation Standards 2016 July 2016 ACPE Accreditation Standards 2016 Become Effective December 2016 UHCOP Ratification of Self-study Report January 2017 Self-study Submitted to ACPE March 2017 Team to UHCOP College Joins AACP Collaborative on Opioid Abuse UH College of Pharmacy is among more than 90 colleges and schools of pharmacy across the U.S. to commit to enhancing the education and training of students and practitioners to reverse the nationwide epidemic of opioid abuse and dependence. The new initiative is being spearheaded by the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy of which UHCOP is a member. The AACP-led effort stresses the important role pharmacy faculty play in reducing this critical public health threat by educating and training student pharmacists about life-saving overdose interventions. \"AACP member institutions educate all their student pharmacists to counsel patients about important public health issues, including opioid abuse and heroin use,\" said AACP Executive Vice President and CEO Lucinda L. Maine, Ph.D., R.Ph.UHCOP Dean F. Lamar Pritchard, Ph.D., R.Ph., said pharmacists are in a unique position as medication experts to help combat drug abuse and addiction. \"As part of our education and service missions, we are wholeheartedly behind the effort to not only bring these issues to the forefront of the national conversation, but also to expand and implement programs to better prepare our students in fulfilling their duty in improving health in our communities,\" Pritchard said. \"Whether it's including drug dependency scenarios in our patient counseling simulation exercises or training them on the use of overdose-intervention medications, we will continue to explore opportunities to give students and practitioners the tools and knowledge to help reverse this disturbing trend of addiction and substance abuse.\" \u00a9 JJAVA/FotoliaDoctor of Pharmacy Michael BachMelissa BaileyMichael Bailey B.

For the first time in its history, UHCOP will have all of its academic and research programs based in one facility centered in the university's Biomedical District. The college will be housed in approximately 157,000 gross square feet across five floors in the nine-story, 300,00-square-foot HBSB2. HBSB2 will not only relieve the college's shortage of space in its current facilities in Science & Research Building 2 and the Texas Medical Center Campus, but also provide space to allow its academic, research and patient care programs to advance and grow to their full potential. The college spaces were meticulously planned to provide learning, practice and research facilities that not only reflect current trends and standards of practice and discovery, but also offer flexibility to deftly adapt to changes in the profession, scientific knowledge and technology. While UHCOP will completely vacate its space in Science & Research Building 2 on the UH Campus, the college's Texas Medical Center Campus will be updated for new UHCOP research and clinical initiatives. The $145 million facility was designed by Shepley Bulfinch and is being built by Tellepsen Builders LP, with oversight by UH Facilities Planning and Construction. Planning and programming for the college space was the result of countless hours of work by UHCOP's leadership, faculty, students, alumni and staff members as well as internal and external consultants. \"Realization of this dream would not have been possible without the foresight, support and leadership of the University of Houston System Board of Regents, UH President Renu Khator and other members of the UH executive administration, and the college's many donors, alumni and friends, not to mention the patience and fortitude of our faculty, staff and students,\" said UHCOP Dean F.

University of Houston College of Pharmacy 21 22 University of Houston College of Pharmacy Fellow UH College of Pharmacy alumni and friends, If you could, would you give to the Capital Campaign? If you knew that your gift could make a difference, would that cause to think about it a little more deeply? What about the students who are in the college now - if you knew one of them personally - would it affect the way you looked at the question? What about the end-product: the graduates of the college? Are you not filled with pride when you see and hear how gifted they are, and how high they score on the licensure exams? If you can, would you consider supporting your college in this campaign? Personally, I did not always give to the college. No special reason, I just really didn't think much about it. For sure, there were times when, even if I had thought about it, I would not have been able to give very much. For me, the decision to make a gift the first time was in response to being asked, at a time when I was able to say yes. At that time, I did have some connection to the college by serving as a preceptor, but deciding to give made me feel a little closer and more connected. UH and the College of Pharmacy have made great strides over the years, and continue to do so. Only a few years ago, UHCOP ranked 54th out of about 140 pharmacy schools in terms of research funding. Today, UH is ranked 31st among all of the colleges of pharmacy, which is amazing considering the cramped quarters in which the researchers conduct their great work. A Top 10 ranking is a very attainable goal in the next few years, given the talent we have and will draw with our new facilities. How well do our students perform on the licensing exams? Our graduates held a 99 percent first-time pass rate on the NAPLEX and a 100 percent first-time pass rate on the MPJE from 2013-2015. Our goal for the Capital Campaign is $5 million, an amount way higher than any previous goals. We are about 80 percent there, with approximately $4 million given or pledged so far. So, it is very doable - but we need to do this to ensure that when the building is completed, everything will be in place. We want to have the very best environment and supplies for our students, and improved research facilities for the gifted researchers. And, as many of you know, our TMC building still is in dire need of improvements and upgrade. If we exceed $5 million, the college will be able to get more in place so that our students and alumni will have facilities that we can proudly talk about and show. This campaign is very personal for me, and I hope it will be for you, too. I have known many students over the years, worked closely with a number of them, and memories of them will always be with me. I am in awe of our dedicated faculty who have given their all in absolute dedication to our students and our profession, often in lecture rooms, office spaces and research labs that would turn the less dedicated away. Please join me in supporting all of them, the students, the faculty, the dean through a donation to this campaign. If you can, will you please give to the Capital Campaign? The amount that you choose to give is less important than your choosing to be a part of the campaign. Certainly, large gifts will be greatly appreciated, but so will more modest gifts. Your participation will make a large difference to the next generation of pharmacists. More importantly, it will make a difference to you by choosing to be a part of something great, something enduring. \u2014 Bruce Biundo, R.Ph., UHCOP Class of 1961A message from the HBSB2 Campaign Chair Bruce BiundoHBSB2 DONORS Susan Abughosh American Pharmacies AmerisourceBergen Services Corp Mohammad Susan Bacon Bruce V.

Wanat Christopher Webber 2014 2013 *visual representation only; proportions not to scale University of Houston College of Pharmacy 23 24 University of Houston College of Pharmacy Eager to help the University of Houston College of Pharmacy reach its true potential as an indisputable leader in the research, Paul and Manmeet Likhari have provided the lead gift of $1 million to the campaign for UH College of Pharmacy's new home in Health and Biomedical Sciences Building 2. Their generous gift for the Likhari Pharmaceutical Core Laboratory aims to transform the college's research capabilities with the advanced technology and state-of-the-art analytical systems the likes of which the college has never seen in its 70-year history. \"Our hope is that this gift to the new building will help the college become more successful in drug development and educating students in everything from basic research to patient care as well as improve its national rankings,\" said Paul Likhari, a longtime member of the Dean's Advisory Council and former adjunct faculty member. \"In spite of the college being split across two campuses and lacking the proper space for research, I've been very impressed in the last few years of how the college has done so well in collaborating with the world-renowned clinicians in the Texas Medical Center and the good work being done with other TMC institutions such as the H.O.M.E.S. Clinic with Baylor College of Medicine and UTHealth. \"Dean Pritchard has a vision for the college and how it can help the university; he has brought in a number of good scientists and faculty. We also were really impressed how UH President Renu Khator has taken the University of Houston to Tier One in such a short time.\" The Likharis' association with the University of Houston and the College of Pharmacy spans more than two decades: UHCOP doctoral program students were provided the opportunity to work on their research projects at Bioassay Laboratories, the Houston-based pharmaceutical contract research laboratory the Likharis acquired with another business partner in 1990. Later renamed BA Research International, the company grew to a staff of more than 100 and claimed about 20 percent of the U.S.-based studies for generic drug manufacturers. Serving as CEO of the company until retiring in March 2008, Likhari is recognized as a leader in drug analysis, particularly in bioavailability and bioequivalence studies. Likhari is credited with developing more than 150 analytical procedures for drugs in biological fluids, conducting more than 1,600 studies and coauthoring several journal articles. \"Pharmacy has been very good to us; this profession has brought us great pleasure because we worked on a number of new and generic drugs and helped in their approval process,\" Likhari said. With more than 30 years' experience in the lab, Likhari is keenly aware of the necessity of adequate equipment and tools to conduct viable, legitimate research. \"In the past, because the college didn't have that many PAUL & MANMEET LIKHARI PHARMACEUTICAL CORE RESEARCH LABORATORY University of Houston College of Pharmacy 25resources, I even gave some of the surplus instruments from our lab to the college or, when they needed HPLC columns, we would order some from our supplier and donate them to the college,\" said Likhari, who was recognized as the 2005 Entrepreneur of the Year by the Indo American Chamber of Commerce of Greater Houston. \"I can understand to do better research, you need good instrumentation and current technology because without these two important elements, you will go nowhere.\" In addition to their first-hand experience in the pharmaceutical industry and health care, the Likharis are proud parents of healthcare professionals: son Gauruv Likhari, M.D., graduated from Baylor College of Medicine and is a Diagnostic Radiology specialist at CHI St. Luke's Health-Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center and daughter Kanchan Sarao is a 2010 UHCOP Pharm.D. graduate and pharmacy manager at Southside Pharmacy in Katy. Longtime members of the college's Mading Society, the Likharis previously established two scholarships for at UH: the Prithvipal and Manmeet Likhari Gurcharan Kaur Likhari Presidential Endowed Scholarship. The Likharis' belief in the power of education and supporting the community extends well beyond the laboratory and health care. One or both of the Likharis have served or are currently serving on various boards, including the Sugar Land Legacy Foundation, Children's Museum of Houston (Fort Bend), Asian Art Society of MFAH, Fort Bend Education Foundation, Child Advocates of Fort Bend, Indo American Chamber of Commerce of Greater Houston, Pratham, India House, Sugar Land Memorial Hermann Hospital Advisory Committee, Gurdwara Sahib of SW Houston, the Indo-American Charity Foundation of Houston, and the Fort Bend Chapter of the American Heart Association. \"Our motto always has been, 'You give where you live,'\" Paul Likhari said. The Likhari Pharmaceutical Core Research Laboratory will provide cutting-edge analytical instruments and equipment for a range of drug development activities as well as a foundation for the planned UH Center for Drug Discovery. Individual specialty cores housed within the Likhari Pharmaceutical Core Laboratory include: Microscopic Imaging - and Maldi-TOF MS; Cardiac, Vascular and Tumor Imaging - High Frequency Ultrasound; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy; Flow Cytometry - 7 Laser flow cytometer; High Throughput Screening - robotic high- throughput optical screening instrument; Molecular Modeling - computing and software for structure/activity modeling; Whole Animal Imaging - IVIS\u00ae X-Ray, Fluorescence and Chemiluminescence imaging; and Dosage Form Characterization - dissolution, particle size and stability studies.About the Likhari Lab Paul and Manmeet Likhari with UH President Renu Khator at the Health and Biomedical Sciences Building 2 campaign kick-off event at the Likharis' home. 26 University of Houston College of PharmacyWith a relationship stretching back more than two decades, UH College of Pharmacy and PCCA have joined in their most ambitious collaboration yet: the creation of the PCCA Compounding and Sterile Products Laboratory in the college's new home in Health and Biomedical Sciences Building 2. The PCCA Compounding and Sterile Products Laboratory will allow the college to present the didactic knowledge and hands-on practice and ensure the core competencies of students in performing sterile and non-sterile compounding and patient physical assessments. While the new laboratory space will allow the college to bring all of its core- curricular training in compounding in-house, students will still have the opportunity to work alongside PCCA preceptors and staff members through various Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences (such as Drug Information, Veterinary Pharmaceutical Care and Consulting). In addition, the college will no longer PCCA COMPOUNDING & STERILE PRODUCTS LABORATORY need to rent space in the sterile products lab operated by Houston Community College's Pharmacy Technician program, where UHCOP students have gone to perform skills assessment for Pharmacy Skills modules. Housed on the Fourth Floor of HBSB2, the PCCA complex comprises three key areas: The Pharmacy Care & Compounding Teaching Lab featuring 16 stations \u2014 each equipped with sinks and other essential equipment for non-sterile compounding and retractable examination tables \u2014 as well as a row of benches for compounding instructional/demonstration space; A state-of-the-art Sterile Products Laboratory comprising one room with 12 biological safety cabinets/hoods for students to learn and practice the sterile products techniques to develop core competencies and a second separate clean room with four hood stations for assessment of their skills and techniques; and A U.S. Pharmacopoeia 800 Standards-compliant antechamber with surgical sinks for scrubbing and gowning. Dean F. Lamar Pritchard is joined by PCCA representatives Renee Prescott, Pharm.D. ('02), Lizzie Harbin, L. David Sparks and Bruce Biundo, R.Ph. ('62) at the Dean's Advisory Council luncheon. David Sparks and his late wife, Kay Sparks, were among the earliest inductees to the college's Mading Society of benefactors in recognition of their gifts to the college and student scholarships. University of Houston College of Pharmacy 27An additional room off of the Pharmacy Care & Compounding Laboratory will serve as the audio-visual \"mission control\" center for the server network of recording equipment through the three teaching/laboratory spaces. The system will provide vastly enhanced instructional opportunities by allowing students and faculty members to review and assess students' techniques. PCCA's gift comes as the company celebrates 35 years of operations this year. Originally founded as Professional Compounding Centers of America in 1981 by several pharmacists who saw a need to serve their fellow professionals amidst a rise in patient and physician interest in compounded medications, PCCA's membership now numbers nearly 4,000 independent community pharmacists in the United States, Canada, Australia and other countries around the world. PCCA serves as a complete resource for pharmacists working with patients and prescribers to provide personalized, compounded medications. The company's products and services include chemical component sales, devices and equipment, training and drug information consulting and support, as well as facility design and compliance assistance. More recently, the company also greatly expanded its quality- assurance testing services by launching Eagle Analytical Services in 2004 to offer clients an external resource for ensuring the safety of their compounded medications. Eagle's service platform includes high-quality sterility, bacterial endotoxin, microbial detection, beyond-use dating (BUD) determination and active-ingredient potency analysis. PCCA Chief Executive Officer L. David Sparks, who joined the company in 1989 as a consultant, said the new state-of-the-art facility will provide students with the foundational training that can be expanded with advanced training from PCCA preceptors and staff later in the curriculum or after entering the workforce. \"This new laboratory is a testament to the productive partnership we have had with the University and the College of Pharmacy for more than 20 of our company's 35 years,\" said Sparks, who previously served on the college's adjunct faculty and Dean's Advisory Council. \"Our unique partnership has provided thousands of UH pharmacy students with the opportunity to learn the most advanced techniques for preparing sterile and non-sterile compounded preparations. \"This gift also is a tribute to the many current and past staff members \u2014 as well as many of our client members \u2014 who are proud UH alumni and played such an important role in making PCCA a leader in our industry.\"David Sparks and his late wife Kay Sparks, who passed in 2012, had been longtime supporters of the college beyond the classroom and lab. Through their gifts in support of college programs as well as student scholarships, the Sparks were among the earliest inductees of the college's Mading Society of benefactors. It's an understatement to say that David and Kay Sparks carved out a reputation as indisputable experts in the field of compounding under their leadership roles at PCCA. Both Sparks were recognized as Fellows of the International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists and the American College of Apothecaries. Graduates of Southwest Oklahoma State University, both David and Kay were recognized with the institution's Distinguished Alumni Awards. David Sparks also was recognized with the National Community Pharmacists Association's John W. Dargavel Medal in 2006 and UHCOP's Meritorious Achievement Award in 2013. In 1997, Kay Sparks was awarded the PCCA Eagle, which is the company's highest honor and is presented to those individuals who have dedicated themselves to the company, their colleagues and to pharmacy compounding. In 2006, IACP named its new headquarters the Kay Sparks Building in honor of her contributions to compounding pharmacy. One year later, PCCA renamed its Employee of the Year award in her honor. \"We are extremely grateful and excited about the opportunities that this cutting-edge facility will afford our students and faculty in the time-honored art and science of compounding through the delivery of didactic knowledge and demonstration of practical techniques for safe, effective compounded medications and sterile products,\" said Dean F. Lamar Pritchard, Ph.D., R.Ph. \"We are very excited and privileged to enhance our outstanding partnership with PCCA \u2014 and provide a real-world training facility for our future professionals \u2014 through this generous gift.\" With the new Compounding & Sterile Products Laboratory in HBSB2, UHCOP will no longer need to rent space at Houston Community College's space for training pharmacy technicians. 28 University of Houston College of PharmacyMichelle Edwards Hamilton, Pharm.D. ('04) was an advocate for patients, a dedicated work colleague, generous friend, and loving mother and wife. Her untimely passing in 2015, left a gap that will never be filled, but her impact will never be lost. The legacy she left for improved medication safety through patient engagement inspired a fundraising campaign to create the Dr. Michelle Hamilton OTC & Patient Counseling Simulated Pharmacy in Health and Biomedical Sciences Building 2 (HBSB2), the College of Pharmacy's new home scheduled for completion in summer 2017. The facility will foster education in the art and science to prepare students for the pharmacists' essential role as unparalleled experts in ensuring safe, effective pharmaceutical care for patients. Students will receive instruction and engage in practical exercises in a variety of evidence-supported patient counseling techniques, such as motivational interviewing, and broader-scope pharmacy services, including but not limited to disease state management and medication therapy management. The suite will include a simulated community pharmacy with a private patient counseling room and a simulated drive-through window. Both areas will be equipped with audio-visual recording systems to capture student performance for review and evaluation by instructors and fellow students. Given her gift for counseling, it's not surprising that Michelle earned a bachelor's degree in communication from Tarleton State University in Stephenville, Texas. Undecided about the direction of her career, Michelle worked as a pharmacy technician for Kroger for several years before one of her supervisors encouraged her to pursue a pharmacy degree. \"She had the passion for it, but she wasn't sure she had the confidence for it,\" husband Brian Hamilton recalled. \"After she started the program, she made the most of the opportunities and was focused on being the best pharmacist she could be.\" Michelle's passion and skill for patient counseling was showcased when she became the first UHCOP student to win the American Pharmacists Association-Academy of Student Pharmacists National Patient Counseling Competition in 2004 after finishing in the top 10 in the prior year. \"She intuitively understood the importance of patient counseling to ensure that every patient would leave the pharmacy with a good understanding of how to take their medication and that they could trust their pharmacist to give them the information needed to improve their health,\" said mentor and friend Lynn Simpson, Pharm.D. ('97), clinical associate professor. Yet, Michelle's commitment to giving back did not stop there: She followed up on her own success by mentoring fellow Cougar Dana Hausmann Hill to a victory the very next year. It would be the first and only time to date that the national title has been won by the same school two years running. Michelle's time at UH also showcased her leadership abilities, as she served as president of her Pharm.D. class, president of the Phi Lambda Sigma Pharmacy Leadership Society and vice president DR.

Hamilton made such an impression on the HEB community and its patients, the San Antonio-based chain provided a gift of $25,000 to the campaign. \"The compassion that Michelle had for people and her passion for helping them epitomizes what makes a community pharmacist great,\" said Tim Halfin, R.Ph., regional pharmacy director for H-E-B Houston Division. \"It is a privilege for H-E-B to support the educational opportunities that the Michelle Hamilton OTC and Patient Counseling Simulated Pharmacy will provide for students who, like Michelle, strive to be the best they can be.\" The Kroger Co. Foundation also has committed its support to the suite with a $10,000 gift in memory of Hamilton, whose career started as a Kroger pharmacy technician and continued as a pharmacy manager with the company after graduation. \"I am so glad Kroger was able to be part of such an amazing undertaking to honor one of our beloved and dearly missed associates,\" said Marla Fielder, Pharm.D., pharmacy merchandiser for Kroger's Southwest Division. \"Michelle touched so many lives and left a legacy to cherish for years to come. Honoring Michelle in such a special way speaks volumes to the alumni, faculty and staff of UH and their commitment to excellence.\" of the college's Kappa Epsilon chapter. In addition to her national title, Michelle also was recognized with UHCOP's Distinguished Student Award in her final year at the college. After graduation, Michelle worked in an environment which she felt would best support her patients: As a community pharmacist, first with Kroger, then with HEB. She grew her reputation as a skilled, caring counselor, innovator, and problem-solver. \"Michelle would tell me stories on how she counseled every patient on their new prescriptions, no matter how busy it was in the pharmacy,\" Simpson said. \"I used her stories as examples to our incoming students who would tell me that they never witnessed their pharmacist counseling patients because it was 'impossible' to do in a busy chain setting.\" Brian Hamilton said Michelle's commitment to her patients was a source of great joy and, at times, grief for her. \"She cared most about spending time with her patients,\" Brian said. \"Michelle was so happy and excited when she was able to help her patients get better; when she lost patients, she wrote letters to the family \u2014 those were difficult days for her.\" Michelle also continued her leadership development after graduation, serving as director and president-elect/president of the Houston Area Pharmacy Association. The college recognized Michelle again in 2007 by presenting her with the UHCOP Outstanding Young Alumnus Award. As a pharmacy manager for HEB, Michelle was preparing to help launch a new store when she received her cancer diagnosis. Michelle lost her hard-fought battle to cancer in February 2015. In addition to her husband, Brian, Michelle is survived by their three children, Caitlyn, 9, Brady, 7, and Dustin, 5. She is also missed by patients, classmates and friends who were blessed by her presence in their lives. As loved ones, friends and colleagues considered ways to honor her life and legacy, the college's new home in HBSB2 offered an appropriate opportunity to create a memorial to her. \"I think everyone responded to the idea of creating a place where students can go and not only remember her, but also share in her passion for counseling by not only becoming more comfortable with patients but also be able to comfort patients,\" said classmate and friend Susan Loughlin, Pharm.D. ('04), BCPS, clinical pharmacy specialist at TIRR Memorial Hermann. Alex C. Varkey, Pharm.D. ('05), Houston Methodist Hospital director of pharmacy operations, had the honor of being on stage with Michelle for her National Patient Counseling Competition win as he was being installed as APhA-ASP national president. \"She was truly a special person and pharmacist,\" Varkey said. \"She had an amazing influence on my life, in the way she carried herself, the way she practiced, the way she promoted the profession.\" UHCOP's Andrea Smesny, Pharm.D. ('98), MPH, and Lynn Simpson, Pharm.D. ('97), accept a $10,000 gift from the Kroger Co. in support of the Hamilton OTC & Patient Counseling Suite presented by Kroger Southwest Division representatives Marla Fielder, Pharm.D., pharmacy merchandiser; Debbie Veselka, R.Ph. (B.S. '94), director of clinical sales; and Bonnie Richardson, pharmacy sales manager. 30 University of Houston College of Pharmacy Women in Pharmacy Conference Room In recognition of the immeasurable impact made by women in the practice of pharmacy, an initiative is under way to establish The Women in Pharmacy Conference Room within UH College of Pharmacy's new home in Health and Biomedical Sciences Building 2. Dean's Advisory Council members Carole Hardin-Oliver, R.Ph. ('83), healthcare supervisor for Walgreens' Houston-Northeast region, and May J. Woo, R.Ph., ('91), regional pharmacist for Emerus Health, are spearheading the UHCOP initiative to create a landmark in dedication to the essential role of women in advancing the profession and delivering exceptional patient care. Hardin-Oliver and Woo are leaders in their own right: In addition to their service on the Texas Pharmacy Foundation Board of Trustees, Hardin-Oliver is a past president of both the Texas Pharmacy Association and the Lake Houston Pharmacy Association, while Woo is a past national president of Phi Lambda Sigma Pharmacy Leadership Society and the Houston Area Pharmacy Association. \"When you stop and look around the room at DAC, then look around the health systems in the Texas Medical Center and the community pharmacies across the Houston area and the state, you realize what an amazing impact that women \u2014 especially College of Pharmacy alumnae \u2014 have made and are continuing to make not only in the pharmacy world, but in health care overall,\" Woo said. Hardin-Oliver and Woo said they were inspired by the success of The Women in Pharmacy Exhibit and Conference Room that they helped establish at the American Pharmacists Association headquarters in Washington, D.C. \"When you walk in the conference room at APhA, you can't help but be awe-struck by the accomplishments of so many great women leaders and get excited to be part of helping to preserve their legacy by providing a source of inspiration and confirmation for future generations of women pharmacists,\" Hardin-Oliver said. For gifts of $500 or more, the names of all donors or those in whose name the gift is made will be on permanent display on the interior or exterior of the conference room.

Lamar Pritchard, Ph.D., R.Ph., in advancing their alma mater, Golden R.Ph. underwritten the Celso Cuellar & Lourdes M. Cu\u00e9llar Dean's Conference Room in Health & Biomedical Sciences Building 2. A lifelong community pharmacist and one-time independent pharmacy owner, Celso continues to work relief at an independent community pharmacy in his native San Antonio after retiring from full-time practice in 2014. Lourdes is administrative director of Pharmacy and Medical Outpatient Clinics and Clinical Support Services at TIRR Memorial Hermann and a UHCOP adjunct faculty member. They are proud members of the UHCOP family, with each serving on the UHCOP Dean's Advisory Council during their careers. The siblings also have been active in pharmacy organizations: Celso is a past president of the Bexar County Pharmacy Association, and Lourdes is a past president of the Texas Society of Health-System Pharmacists and the Gulf Coast Society of Health-System Pharmacists as well as a past president/chair of the TSHP Research & Education Foundation. Lourdes also has served on the National Quality Forum and the Texas Statewide Health Coordinating Council as well as numerous committees and task forces of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, which recently published a third edition of her Preceptors Handbook for Pharmacists in collaboration with fellow alumna Diane B. Ginsburg, Ph.D., M.S. ('90), R.Ph.The siblings grew up in a San Antonio pharmacy owned by their father, with Celso reflecting that he likely \"took his first steps in the drug store.\" The family has established two endowments for UH Pharmacy students: a Presidential Endowed Scholarship in memory of the siblings' late parents, Celso Cuellar Sr. & Matiana Cuellar, and a Presidential Endowed Fellowship in honor of Lourdes and younger sister, Nicanora Cuellar, MSW, LCSW, DCSW, a social worker at Memorial Hermann Southwest Hospital. \"I've always had a soft spot for what students have to go through in terms of the costs of going to school,\" Celso said. \"I always remember when I was in school, working part-time and still looking for bargains wherever we could \u2014 like when the Daily Cougar would print coupons to get three burgers for something like 25 cents, that'd be your meals for the entire day.\" Celso said sharing one's good fortune and success \u2014 along with having a strong work ethic, faith and educational aspirations \u2014 were among the life lessons passed down from his parents. \"Our parents pointed us in the right direction,\" he said. \"Giving back was just something they always stressed, so we grew up not having to think about it much \u2014 it's just something you do because it's the right thing to do. \"Our family has been very blessed with opportunities to get a good education for careers that allow us to help people, both physically and financially, so we feel it's our obligation to do that.\" Our family has been very blessed with opportunities to get a good education for careers that allow us to help people... \u2014 Celso CuellarResearch News SALT OF THE GIRTH 32 University of Houston College of Pharmacy University of Houston College of Pharmacy 33 HUSSAIN AIMS TO REDEFINE ROLE OF RECEPTORS' LINK IN OBESITY, HYPERTENSION WITH $1.7M NIH RENEWAL Despite intensive public health education efforts over the years, the U.S. to halt and reverse the continuing rise in U.S. obesity rates, researchers such as UH College of Pharmacy Professor Tahir Hussain, Ph.D., are delving deeper into the mechanisms and impact of obesity-associated comorbidities \u2014 such as hypertension \u2014 to identify potential new therapeutic targets. Due to a complex series of biochemical and physiological changes that occur in obesity (especially in association with a high-sodium diet), hypertension is approximately two times as prevalent in obese patients. Hypertension is part of an interrelated family of comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and heart failure, diabetes and kidney failure, that commonly develop when left untreated (and often, in spite of treatment). Hussain's work is focused on the functional relationship between two receptors of the hormone angiotensin II (Ang II), which plays a major role in regulating blood pressure through vasoconstriction/vasodilation and extracellular fluid through water and sodium retention/secretion. Ang II has two primary receptors: the highly expressed AT1 subtype is associated with the deleterious effects of vasoconstriction and sodium retention, while the lower-expressing AT2 subtype has an oppositional function to AT1 and only recently has become a target of interest for researchers. With the long-held view that AT1 was the prime suspect in hypertension, two of the most prescribed anti-hypertension drugs on the market today are angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which inhibit production of Ang II by blocking an essential enzyme, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), which block the activity of the AT1 receptor (but not AT2) and consequently reduce the levels of Ang II. With most of the research over the past five decades focused on the harmful effects of AT1, less is known about the roles and mechanisms of other renin-angiotensin system components. \"What we have learned in the past 10 years of research is that some components, including AT2, have beneficial effects in increasing sodium excretion and lowering blood pressure,\" Hussain said. \"Because AT2 expression is low, simply leaving it alone \u2014 in the case of ARBs \u2014 isn't sufficient to realize AT2's full benefits, which also includes anti-oxidant and anti-inflammation effects that further protect the kidney from injury. \"The goal of our research is to determine how to activate AT2 expression pharmacologically with an agonist. As hypertension is commonly treated with more than one drug, we're specifically looking to see if we can use ARBs to inhibit the deleterious component \u2014 AT1 \u2014 along with an activator to stimulate the beneficial component of AT2.\" With the support of a new five-year, $1.7 million RO1 renewal grant from the National Institute of Kidney Disease and Digestive Disorders awarded earlier this year, Hussain is focusing his attention on the possible interdependency of AT2 with a relatively recently discovered biochemical pathway in the renin-angiotensin system: the biologically active Ang1-7 produced by angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) at the Mas receptor site. \"Independently, what we found is that if we activate AT2 or we activate the Mas receptor, they both increase sodium excretion from the body,\" Hussain said. \"But we also found that if you stimulated AT2, but blocked the Mas receptor, the effect goes away. Both receptors are physically interacting and influence each other's function.\" Hussain's work in the development of new therapeutics is not only important to manage the ongoing rise of obesity-related hypertension, but also due to the fact that segments of the population are resistant \u2014 or developing resistance \u2014 to ACE and ARB therapies. Hussain's postdoctoral research associate Sanket Patel, Ph.D., was recognized with a New Investigator Award to present their latest findings at Hypertension 2016, the American Heart Association's Council on Hypertension Scientific Sessions Sept. 14-17. Patel's presentation, \"Co-localization and Natriuretic MasR in Obese Rat Kidney,\" highlighted further evidence for a relationship between the angiotensin AT2 receptor and the Mas receptor as a potential new avenue for treating hypertension and even diabetes related to obesity. In the study, both urine flow and urinary sodium excretion increased in obese rats following infusion of either AT2R or MasR agonists, but flow and excretion decreased following infusion of either AT2R or MasR antagonists.AHA Kidney Council Honors Postdoc for Research on AT2, Mas Receptors 34 University of Houston College of Pharmacy WHAT LURKS BELOW With the support of a five-year, $3.8 million R01 grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases awarded last summer \u2014 the largest single National Institutes of Health award in UH College of Pharmacy's history \u2014 Assistant Professor Gregory D. Cuny, Ph.D., and his collaborators are taking on one of the world's most common sources of waterborne infectious disease: the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium. Cryptosporidiosis \u2014 infections caused primarily by the C. parvum and C. hominis species \u2014 is considered an emerging threat among infectious diseases by the U.S. Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention. With no vaccine currently available, no therapeutic deemed totally effective and infection possible after ingesting only a handful or so of the parasites, Cryptosporidium also has been identified as a potential bioterrorism agent. Infection triggers acute, and often chronic, diarrhea, weight loss, dehydration, nausea, vomiting, fever, and stomach cramps, with symptoms lasting one to two weeks. The parasite's oocyst stage of its life cycle has a tough outer wall that makes it not only resistant to common water treatment techniques such as chlorination, but also long-lived in the environment after shedding by the infected host. \"Although cryptosporidiosis is generally non-lethal in immunocompetent populations, it's capable of being widely and easily distributed and difficult to eradicate \u2014 it could cause a lot of havoc,\" Cuny said. Segments of the population most at risk for infection, which can be fatal, are infants, the elderly and those with compromised immune systems. Epidemiological studies in developing regions have identified Crypto among the leading causes of prolonged, persistent diarrhea in children under 2, which combined with malnutrition and dehydration is linked to increased risk of mortality as well as unrecoverable growth and cognitive deficits. Although there are no reliable estimates on the global scale of the number of people infected or killed as a result of infection by cryptosporidiosis each year, it is of greatest concern in developing nations where the potential for transmission and severity of symptoms tend to be exacerbated by endemic malnutrition, scarcity of clean food and water, and limited healthcare resources. Yet, the developed world is by no means safe from cryptosporidiosis: According to the CDC, it is the leading cause of waterborne illness in humans in the U.S., with an estimated 748,000 cases occurring each year.CUNY EARNS LARGEST NIH GRANT IN UHCOP HISTORY TO DEVELOP NOVEL DRUGS TO FIGHT HARDY PARASITE IN WATER, SOIL University of Houston College of Pharmacy 35 In the largest documented U.S. Crypto outbreak, more than 400,000 people were infected \u2014 about 25 percent of the state's population at the time \u2014 and nearly 70 died after contamination of a water-treatment plant in Milwaukee, Wis., in 1993. In addition, a CDC report estimated the Milwaukee outbreak also resulted in more than $96 million in combined healthcare costs and productivity losses. More recently, more than 100 people were infected with Crypto-associated gastroenteritis after using swimming pools in Maricopa County, Ariz., only last summer. Cuny and his collaborators at UHCOP and elsewhere are aiming to change the equation in humans' favor. The researchers have identified and synthesized several compounds that inhibit a key enzyme involved in nucleotide synthesis called iosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), which is responsible for cell growth and proliferation, to effectively starve the parasite of biochemical fuel necessary for its survival. As the Cryptosporidium IMPDH gene (CpIMPDH) appears to have been obtained from bacteria via lateral transfer, it is structurally different from host IMPDH orthologs and consequently not likely to interfere with host IMPDH activity. Cuny's collaborators include fellow Striepen, Ph.D., University of Georgia. The co-crystal structures of the compounds under investigation were developed at Argonne National Laboratory. \"While we're continuing our work with the initial class of compounds we previously identified and synthesized, we're also looking to several new areas,\" said Cuny, whose prior Crypto work was supported by a $697,000 NIH grant in 2014. \"We're exploring new structure classes, compounds with different binding modes, compounds with tissue-specific vs. systemic distribution, and the effects of these compounds on the gastrointestinal microbiome. \"Those last two points are very important because infection is generally localized in the lower intestine so we don't want to tip the scale in favor of bad bacteria present in the gut. However, infection can involve other organs in immunocompromised patients, which is another reason we are looking at compounds in which systemic distribution could be beneficial.\" Their work is not without challenges unique to Crypto: Although the parasite is extremely hardy and long-lived in nature, it cannot be cultured continuously in the lab (unlike bacteria) and neither tissue-culture models nor most animal models accurately reflect the complex environment of the human gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the pathogenesis of cryptosporidiosis still is not well understood more than 100 years after its discovery. \"Even if we're unsuccessful with our current compounds, our work is allowing us to develop a pharmacophore model \u2014 a structural blueprint \u2014 that can help guide exploration of other IMPDH-inhibitors,\" Cuny said. Recent discoveries in the areas of circulating tumor cells as well as mechanisms of drug resistance in breast cancer by UH College of Pharmacy's Meghna V. Trivedi, Pharm.D. ('03), Ph.D. ('04), BCOP, have garnered national recognition from fellow cancer researchers at the Hematology-Oncology Pharmacy Association (HOPA) and the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR). Trivedi's work on the first-ever detection of two elusive types of cancer cells in patient-derived xenograft (PDX)-bearing mouse models - a discovery that could increase understanding of how the cancer spreads to other parts of the body - was honored with the HOPA's 2016 Basic Science and Clinical Research Literature Award in March. The award recognized her 2015 Breast Cancer Research journal publication entitled \"Circulating and Disseminated Tumor Cells from Breast Cancer Patient- derived Xenograft-bearing Mice as a Novel Model to Study Metastasis.\" The project involved a multi-institutional team from UHCOP, Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), University Federico II in Naples, Italy, and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Trivedi and her colleagues have been investigating experimental models that could provide a renewable, continual source of two types of cancer cells - circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood and disseminated tumor cells in bone marrow (BM-DTCs) - that have been associated with breast cancer metastases. \"We found an association between the presence of CTCs and BM DTCs in the mice bearing the patient-derived xenografts, which is also observed in patients, further validating the utility of these models,\" Trivedi said. \"More importantly, we found a correlation between the presence of CTC clusters and lung metastasis. This was quite interesting as CTC clusters are also observed in some patients, and now it is thought that they may have more metastatic power.\" With this discovery, Trivedi and her collaborators are continuing to explore the possibility that CTCs could serve as a valuable biomarker to help guide therapeutic decisions. To date, the utility of CTCs and BM-DTCs have been impractical due the biophysical limitations: CTCs are generally not present in sufficient quantities in a typical blood sample, and fluid extracted from bone marrow not only fails to yield sufficient quantities of DTCs but also is hindered by accessibility challenges and potential complications in the patient. \"The tumors are continuously changing, so CTCs are the surrogate to monitor what's going on in the tumor of patients at a particular time,\" she said. \"Collection of blood is much easier for patients than getting another biopsy of tumors.\" The team also conducted gene expression analysis to identify a gene signature of the primary PDX tumor predictive for both CTC clusters and lung metastases in these models. A four-gene signature overlap was identified and compared against public datasets of breast cancer patients, which indicated the gene signature predicted worse distant ON THE TRAIL OF TUMORIGENESIS 36 University of Houston College of Pharmacymetastases-free survival in breast cancer patients. The development offers a new investigative and preclinical model for evaluating prospective therapies, Trivedi said. \"These transplanted tumor cells and their multi-generational successor tumor cells retain the molecular and biological characteristics of the parental tumor cells, which gives us confidence that these models represent a clinically relevant tool for studying CTCs and their role in tumor progression and metastases and their utility in making treatment decisions,\" she said. Trivedi's BCM study collaborators were co-corresponding author Schiff, Ph.D., C. Kent Osborne, M.D., Mothaffar F. Rimawi, M.D., Michael T. Lewis, Ph.D., Chad Shaw, Ph.D., Chad J. Creighton, Ph.D., Alejandro Contreras, M.D., Ph.D., Carolina Ph.D., G. Hilsenbeck, Ph.D., and Tamika Mitchell, B.S. Other members of the research team were members of Trivedi's lab: Raksha M.D., of University Federico II; and Rinath M. Jeselsohn, M.D., of Harvard Medical School. In a subsequent study, Trivedi and her collaborators found dynamic and differential effects of chemotherapy regimens on single CTCs and CTC clusters, potentially reflecting the genetic characteristics of tumors and their unique response to selected chemotherapy agents. The project offered further evidence of using CTCs and CTC clusters to assess the presence of tumor-specific mutations as well as the adaptation of an existing commercial technology by Seattle, Wash.-based biotechnology company RareCyte Inc. to analyze smaller blood volume available from the model. A collaborative study between UHCOP, BCM and Rarecyte, coauthors Ph.D., and Arturo Rodriguez, Ph.D. Trivedi also was among a handful of investigators to receive a Minority-serving Institution Faculty Scholar in Cancer Research Award in support of their presentations at the 2016 American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting. At the meeting, Trivedi not only presented the Rarecyte project, but also her work to identify novel drug targets for overcoming resistance in breast cancer therapy. In the latter project, Trivedi described targeting of a specific protein receptor \u2014 GPR110 \u2014 that is part of a G protein-coupled receptor family, whose members are the target of more than 30 percent of U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs with well-known, long-established safety profiles, and thus provide a less toxic alternative therapy. This study was focused in a subgroup of breast cancer called HER2- positive breast cancer, where the biggest clinical challenge is drug resistance to anti-HER2 drug regimens. \"Our studies suggest a role of GPR110 in tumorigenesis, specifically in the context of anti-HER2 drug resistance and in metastatic processes,\" Trivedi said. The M.D., and Mothaffar Rimawi, M.D. University of Houston College of Pharmacy 37Research collaborations between the labs of UHCOP's Meghna Trivedi and BCM's Rachel Schiff have garnered recognition from the Hematology-Oncology Pharmacy Association and the American Association for Cancer Research. 38 University of Houston College of Pharmacy University of Houston College of Pharmacy 39 With the vastly upgraded research facilities and capabilities expected to be brought online with the college's move to its new home in Health and Biomedical Sciences Building 2 in 2017, the potential advancements in the discovery and development of novel drugs and drug targets are virtually unimaginable. No further proof of the enormous strides the college will make in its research productivity almost instantaneously and well into the coming decades is what faculty, student and staff researchers have been able to accomplish working with what amounts to \"rock and flint\" in the scientific community. ASPET, Medical World Americas Pharmacology doctoral candidate Santosh Suryavanshi secured two finalist positions in international competitions for his presentations on his work with UHCOP Associate Professor Bradley McConnell, Ph.D., FAPS, FAHA, on potential new drug targets for heart failure. At his first conference of 2016, Suryavanshi took a third-place finish in the Graduate Student Best Presentation competition of the Cardiovascular Pharmacology Division at the American Society of Pharmacology & Experimental Therapeutics (ASPET) 2016 Annual Meeting in San Diego, Calif. Suryavanshi followed up his ASPET performance with a Top 10 finalist spot at the 2016 Medical World Americas meeting in Houston. Suryavanshi's presentations discussed the work by McConnell's lab in how the absence of a specific protein called Gravin affects regulation on beta-adrenergic signaling, which is one of the biochemical processes essential for cardiac contractility and overall normal heart function. An A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP), gravin scaffolds essential cardiac proteins in the heart and regulates complex intracellular signaling pathways. \"With the help of latest technology in the lab, we measured intracellular calcium changes and cardiac cell contractility from heart cells and muscles isolated from wild-type and gravin knock-out mice,\" Suryavanshi said. \"To mimic heart failure in humans, we induced heart failure in these mice by chronic isoproterenol (a beta adrenergic agonist) administration. \"Interestingly, we found that the gravin knock-out mice had significantly lower intracellular calcium transients, but higher corresponding contractility as compared to the wild-type mice. This is an indication of higher cardiac sensitivity to calcium, which is significantly depressed in heart failure patients.\" Improvements in calcium cycling or sensitivity may prove useful targets for the treatment of heart failure and disruption of gravin may be exploited further as a potential target to increase cardiac sensitivity to calcium. Fewer than a dozen graduate students were invited to participate in the ASPET's Cardiovascular Pharmacology competition. Suryavanshi also received an ASPET Travel Award to present his poster in the general poster session of the meeting, which was part of the 2016 Experimental Biology conference. Coauthors of the ASPET- presented project were UHCOP alumna Sonal Singh, Ph.D. ('15), postdoctoral fellow at the University of Florida College of Pharmacy; Wei Dong Gao, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine; and Bradley K. McConnell, Ph.D., FAPS, FAHA, UHCOP associate professor whose National Institutes of Health grant supported the project. In addition to coauthorship by Singh, Gao and McConnell, the Medical World Americas presented-project was coauthored by former research scholar Faisal Fa'ak, Ph.D., and current research staff member Andrea Diaz Diaz. continued next page RECOGNITION OF CUTTING-EDGE RESEARCH SHOWCASES QUALITY AND IMPACT OF STUDENTS, FACULTY MENTORSASPIRING INVESTIGATORS Third Place, Cardiovascular Graduate Student Division, FASEB-MARC and ASPET Travel Awards, ASPET 2016 Annual Meeting 2 Student Research Awards, ACCP 2016 Annual Meeting JOGUE Junior Scientist Award in Nutrition Award, ASIOA Annual Meeting 2016 4 Finalists, Student Research Poster Competition, ISPOR International Meeting Top 10 Finalist, Medical World Americas 2016 Meeting Honorable Mention, TSHP Research & Education Foundation Student Research Poster Evidence of Excellence 40 University of Houston College of PharmacyJOGUE Junior Scientist Award in Nutrition Prior to graduating from the Pharmacology doctoral program in August, Naimesh Solanki, M.S., received the JOGUE Junior Scientist Award in Nutrition for his research examining behavioral and biochemical outcomes of psychological stress in rodents and the role of natural antioxidants of nutritional value, such as grape seeds, in preventing and rescuing some of these deficits. \"This project has shed light on the non-traditional concept \u2014 involvement of oxidative stress \u2014 in the pathophysiology of stress-associated conditions, including anxiety, depression and cognitive impairment,\" Solanki said. \"Daily intake of natural antioxidants in stressful conditions could be suggested as a supportive therapy along with current pharmacotherapy. \"It would be interesting to know which molecules of the oxidative stress pathway are regulated by natural antioxidants. When extrapolated, this research is expected to contribute to a deeper understanding of the comorbid prevalence of anxiety and other psychological disorders.\" ACCP Student Research Awards Pharmaceutics doctoral candidates Mahua Sarkar and Asma El-Zailik received Student Research Awards from the American College of Clinical Pharmacology to present their research at the ACCP 2016 Annual Meeting in September 2016, marking the sixth consecutive year in which current students or recent graduates of Professor Diana S-L. Chow, Ph.D., have received ACCP awards. El-Zailik's project was based on an assessment of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of statins following gastric bypass surgery to achieve effective weight loss in obese patients. As this patient population typically suffers from and receives treatment for hyperlipidemia, the researchers sought to determine how post-surgery absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of the drugs might be affected by anatomical changes from the procedure. The study indicated changes in concentrations of the drugs following surgery, noting initial decrease followed by an increase in drug concentrations but with large inter-individual variations. The authors suggested dose modifications and concentration monitoring to mitigate and manage post-surgery adverse effects. In addition to Chow, coauthors on El-Zailik's project were Houston Methodist Hospital's Vadium Sherman, M.D., FACS, FRCSC, and Texas Southern University's Lily K. Cheung, Pharm.D. Sarkar's project was based on Chow's ongoing collaboration with Houston Methodist Hospital Professor of Neurosurgery Robert Grossman, M.D., on the drug riluzole as a potential therapeutic for acute spinal cord injury. Currently in a phase II trial for SCI, the researchers investigated the potential co-administration of an inhibitory drug to increase the availability of riluzole in the brain and spinal cord. The team found co-administration of the drugs did not alter plasma pharmacokinetics of riluzole but brain- and spinal cord-to-plasma ratios did increase in an animal model. The results suggested the possibility of additive or synergistic effect on treatment efficacy with the coadministered drug, but indicated the need for further study. Contributing to the study was The University of Mississippi Medical Center's Raymond Grill, Ph.D. TSHP R&E Foundation Honorable Kaitlin home an \"Honorable Mention\" certificate from the TSHP Research & Education Foundation-sponsored Student Research Poster Competition at the 2016 TSHP Annual Seminar. As part of ongoing research at UHCOP on Clostridium difficile infections, Wasko took more than 200 samples from 22 randomly selected parks in the Greater Houston area \u2014 specifically from \"high-touch\" and \"low-touch\" locations within the parks \u2014 and cultured the samples. Subsequent analysis revealed that 31 percent grew C.diff, with almost 70 percent of the colonies testing positive Pharmaceutics doctoral candidates Mahua Sarkar and Asma El-Zailik were recognized with Student Research Awards by the American College of Clinical Pharmacology. Student Poster Competition Honorable Mention recipient Kaitlin Wasko is congratulated by TSHP Research & Education Foundation representatives Craig Frost, of Pharmacy 41for the life-threatening toxins that wreak havoc on the infected patient's gastrointestinal system. The results indicate the ubiquitous presence of C.diff in parks, which lends support to the idea of developing more robust infection control strategies that start at the hospital's front door. Coauthors of the study were UHCOP faculty members M. Jahangir Alam, Ph.D., and Kevin W. Garey, Pharm.D., M.S., FASHP; of Texas at Austin undergraduate Anana Anu; and UHCOP staff member Julie Miranda, B.S. (Biology '14). ISPOR Poster Finalists Four projects from the Pharmaceutical Health Outcomes and Policy program were recognized as finalists in the Research Poster Competition at the International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research's 21st Annual International Meeting. The UHCOP finalists Hatfield, Ph.D. ('16) Ph.D., - \"Modeling Ecodevelopmental Context of STDs/ HIV Risk and Protective Behaviors Among African American Adolescents,\" with UHCOP adjunct faculty member faculty members Susan Ph.D., Hua M.D., Ph.D., E.

An inherited cause of intellectual disability, especially among boys, Fragile X Syndrome results in a spectrum of intellectual disabilities ranging from mild to severe as well as physical and behavioral characteristics. Cognitive impairment in neurodevelopmental disorders like FXS is thought to be due to abnormal neuroplasticity (the developmental changes in the brain), which alters synaptic connections. Work by the lab of his UHCOP advisor Maria V. Tejada-Simon, Ph.D., M.Ed. ('07), and others has found that the Rho family protein Rac1 plays an important role in synapse formation, with an abnormally high number of synapses found in FXS mouse models following the newborn-to-juvenile developmental stages. \"During their developmental aging and growth into juvenile stage, the FXS mouse model \u2014 in which Rac1 expression is up-regulated \u2014 fail to undergo 'pruning' of the surplus of synapse neural connections,\" Martinez said. \"Yet, we found that by pharmacologically inhibiting Rac1 to prevent its activation and membrane translocation, we were able to rescue cognitive function to improve their learning and memory skills.\" Following peer review of Martinez's abstract, he also was invited for an oral presentation at the Julius Axelrod Symposium: New Vistas on Drug and Gene Therapies . Working under Assistant Professor Samina Salim, Naimesh Solanki received the 2016 JOGUE Junior Scientist Award from the Association of Scientists of Indian Origin in America. While working under Associate Professor Maria V. Tejada-Simon, M.Ed., Ph.D., recent Pharmacology graduate Luis Martinez earned an FASEB-MARC Travel Award and an invitation to present their latest findings at the ASPET International Meeting. 42 University of Houston College of PharmacyDISCOVERY ON DISPLAY \"If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.\" \u2014 Sir Isaac Newton Scientific collaboration and the sharing of knowledge are hallmarks of academia-based science, and UH College of Pharmacy has been a strong proponent of this philosophy since its founding. This rich tradition was never more apparent as three separate research symposia \u2014 the 43rd Annual MALTO Medicinal Chemistry-Pharmacognosy Meeting-in-Miniature, the 4th Annual PPS Research Symposium, and a special Pharmacokinetics Symposium \u2014 were hosted by the college during 2016. As host of the 43rd Annual MALTO meeting in May, UH College of Pharmacy welcomed more than 70 attendees from five states to share their latest research in the discovery and design of synthetic compounds and natural products for the treatment of cancer, inflammation, oxidative stress, and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. MALTO's roots date back to 1974 when UHCOP Professor Emeritus Thomas Lemke and fellow founders put together the first meeting for institutions from Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas and Oklahoma (lending to the original name of \"ALTO\"), with the organization's name revised with the addition of Mississippi. UHCOP BECOMES NEXUS FOR RESEARCH MEETINGS ACROSS MULTIPLE FIELDS Satyabrata Pany, a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of UHCOP Associate Professor Joydip Das, explains the findings from their work on the mechanisms of alcohol binding in the presynaptic zone in the search for novel drug targets for treating alcoholism at the 43rd Annual MALTO Meeting hosted by UHCOP. The 2016 PPS Research Symposium presentation winners and finalists were, front row, Santosh Suryavanshi; Pictured are, back row, Organizing Committee Chair Tahir Hussain, Ph.D., PPS Department Chair Doug Eikenburg, Ph.D., UH Graduate School Dean Dmitri Litvinov, Ph.D., and Committee members Romi Ghose, Ph.D., and Jason Eriksen, Ph.D. Nearly 50 poster and podium presentations undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows were made at the meeting, with three awards for the top presentations: The Ronald F.

Among the presentation honorees were first-place award recipients in the following categories: Graduate Student Oral Presentation \u2014 Pharmacology Ph.D. candidate Ankita Salvi with advisor Samina Salim, Ph.D., for their project entitled \"Effect of Simulated Vehicle Exhaust Exposure (SVEE) on Behavioral and Cognitive Parameters In Rats\"; Graduate Student Poster Presentation \u2014 Pharmacology Ph.D. candidate Santosh Suryavanshi with advisor Bradley McConnell, Ph.D., FAPS, FAHA, for their project entitled \"Key Insights into Cardiac Calcium Handling and Contractility in the Absence of Gravin's Scaffolding in Mice\"; and Postdoctoral Oral Presentation \u2014 Aaron Raymond, Ph.D., with Udugamasooriya for their project entitled \"Activity Validation of Cancer Stem Cell-specific Peptidomimetic Antagonists.\" In a fitting tribute to their loved one and colleague, Peers, mentors and mentees of Lakshmi Putcha, Ph.D. ('81), M.S. ('75), special Pharmacokinetics Symposium Sept. 28, the one-year anniversary of her passing. Co-organized by Putcha's husband and son, Mallik and Girish, and longtime collaborator and friend UHCOP Professor Diana S-L. Chow, Ph.D., the symposium featured not only scientific presentations but reflections on Putcha's spirit. \"The theme of the symposium is to showcase the significant role of pharmacokinetics in the entire spectrum of drug discovery and delivery for the ultimate goal of providing the effective and optimal therapy to patients,\" Chow said. Among the scientific session presenters were Richard Brundage, Pharm.D., Ph.D., of R.Ph., of The Texas-MD Anderson Cancer Center; K. Sandy Pang, Ph.D., of the of Toronto; and UHCOP alumnus Mohammad Tabrizifard, Ph.D., B.S. ('91), of Merck. Putcha's NASA Johnson Space Center colleague Vernie R. Coleman Daniels, M.S., R.Ph., and former UH graduate advisor Stuart Feldman, Ph.D., of the University of Georgia also shared stories of her innovations and zest for life. The event also included remarks by Consul General of India Anupam Ray, UHCOP Dean F. Lamar Pritchard, Ph.D., R.Ph., and UH Interim Vice President of Research & Technology Transfer Ramanan Krishnamoorti, Ph.D. During the symposium, Mallik Putcha announced the creation of four scholarship endowments at UH and UH-Clear Lake, including the Dr. Lakshmi Putcha Endowment in Pharmaceutics.Presenters and special guests at the Pharmacokinetics Symposium included Mohammad Tabrizifard, K. Sandy Pang, Diana S-L. Chow, Girish Putcha, Jitesh D. Kawedia. PK Symposium Pays Tribute to Legacy of Late Lakshmi Putcha 44 University of Houston College of Pharmacy A new technology co-developed by a UH College of Pharmacy faculty member and a Pharmacology doctoral student may revolutionize the accuracy and accessibility of diagnostic screenings for a variety of cancers through a process that reverses the \"masking\" effect of commonly used tissue-preservation processes that can impair the detection of cancer cells and biomarkers of other diseases. Teomics is a startup biotechnology company co-founded in 2015 by UHCOP Associate Professor Jason Eriksen, Ph.D., and Pharmacology Ph.D. candidate Craig Vollert, along with Willy Moree, Ph.D., a former UH research staff member. The Teomics team has developed a new \"antigen retrieval protocol\" for reversing the chemical modifications by the commonly used solutions to preserve biopsy tissue samples before undergoing diagnostic imaging and analyses. The platform aims to provide more accurate detection of diseases, particularly with certain types of cancers that may be more prone to \"false negative\" results due to such factors as lower-expressing biomarker proteins and the chemical \"masking\" of proteins with the use of one of the most common chemicals for \"fixing\" or preserving tissue samples: formaldehyde.While working on a National Institutes of Health-funded project related to Alzheimer's disease, Eriksen was unsuccessful in staining blood vessels using conventional antibodies in order to visualize protein targets. \"I got the idea that perhaps it was the tissue pre-treatment process with formaldehyde that might make the difference,\" Eriksen said. \"The antigen-retrieval process is a surprisingly common lab technique, but it's very poorly understood and we discovered lots of gaps in detailed explanations of the processes. \"After we closely examined what was really happening throughout the process, we realized there might be an opportunity to reverse the chemical modifications from the fixative. As we started looking into compounds to achieve antigen retrieval, we found a whole class of compounds of varying scavenging strengths.\" Although the company is initially focused on the cancer diagnostics market, the co-founders believe their formaldehyde-scavenging compounds have broader application to advance disease detection and research using current diagnostic probes but also salvage untapped probes deemed ineffective. Eriksen and Vollert pointed to a 2015 survey by The Scientist that indicated FIXATED ON SUCCESS UHCOP FACULTY, STUDENT CO-FOUNDED STARTUP GAINS STEAM WITH REVOLUTIONARY COMPOUNDS FOR DIAGNOSTIC IMAGINGPharmacology Ph.D. candidate Craig Vollert serves as CEO of Teomics, which is gearing up to market its antigen-retrieval protocol for improved diagnostic imaging. University of Houston College of Pharmacy 45over 75 percent of researchers are replacing failed antibodies on a routine basis within a global marketplace generating revenue of $1.6 billion and growing. With one U.S. patent pending and additional patent applications through the University of Houston in progress, the startup recently earned funding from the highly competitive National Science Foundation's I-CORPS Program as well as a highly coveted spot among the Rice Alliance's \"10 Most Promising Life Science Companies\" at the Houston-based 2016 Texas Life Science Venture Forum in May. Teomics previously received support from the UH Technology Gap Fund through the Office of the Vice President for Research and Technology Transfer, and Vollert has taken advantage of various entrepreneurial training and lab-to-marketplace preparatory programs at UH and Houston, including RED Labs and the Cougar Venture Fund at Bauer College of Business. The latest round of funding \u2014 a $50,000 grant from the NSF's highly competitive Innovation Corps (I-CORPS) Program \u2014 included an intensive three-day workshop in Austin along with assistance in conducting direct-outreach research on prospective customers to support or challenge assumptions and initial needs analyses on the product's potential demand in the marketplace. \"The Rice Alliance award provides further validation and support for the Teomics platform and our technology's market potential,\" said Vollert, who serves as CEO of Teomics. \"We're moving forward on several fronts to prepare for the start of production and deployment, including continued discussions with prospective investors, conducting additional market research, and setting up our office and lab space.\" Billed as one of the largest life science venture capital conferences in the Southwest, the Texas Life Science Venture Forum at Rice University's BioScience Research Collaborative is hosted by the Rice Alliance for Technology and Entrepreneurship, BioHouston, and the Texas Healthcare and BioScience Institute. A recently published journal article on the preclinical experiments of a novel nanoparticle co-invented by UHCOP Associate Professor Jason Eriksen, Ph.D., reveal promising results of the technology for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease. The nanoparticle platform - ADx - was developed by Eriksen and his co-inventor Ananth Annapragada, Ph.D., professor of Radiology and director of Basic Research in the Edward B. Singleton Department of Pediatric Radiology at Texas Children's Hospital. The ADx technology utilizes a liposomal nanoparticle that can cross the blood-brain barrier and bind to amyloid plaques in the brain, which is one of two primary biomarkers that have been identified in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. One of the most unique aspects of the technology is its capability to provide high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the 1-3 Tesla field strengths, which is within the parameters of MRI devices commonly used in small and large healthcare settings today. In a paper published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, the investigators reported the detection of amlyloid-bound nanoparticles in amyloid-positive mice \u2014 and no signal detection in amyloid-negative mice \u2014 using MRI and near-infrared microscopy. The imaging results were confirmed by immuno- histochemical and fluorescent microscopic examination, which found colocalization of the fluorescent tags and amyloid deposits. With two U.S. patent applications filed, commercial development of their high-resolution nanotechnology imaging platform is being pursued by Houston-based biotechnology startup Alzeca Biosciences LLC. Eriksen chairs Alzeca's Scientific Advisory Board, which also includes Annapragada. Alzeca has announced its goal of initiating human clinical trials of ADx in 2018. Alzheimer's Detection Nanoparticle Co-invented by UHCOP's Eriksen Shines in Published Preclinical Study Stymied in his attempts to stain preserved blood vessels, faculty researcher Jason Eriksen discovered a novel solution to reverse the preservative's masking of protein markers through the use of formaldehyde-scavenging compounds. 46 University of Houston College of Pharmacy While it's standard practice for medication warning labels to advise patients to \"Store in a Cool, Dry Place,\" manufacturers probably didn't mean in the frigid, irradiated vacuum of space. Although crews arrive to the International Space Station (ISS) in peak physical condition, they nonetheless require medications for various ailments and injuries ranging from backaches and sinus congestion to microgravity-induced motion sickness during missions. With a manned mission to Mars among NASA's top goals, in-depth study of the efficacy and stability of medications is critical to ensure the health of crews during long-term spaceflights. UH College of Pharmacy postdoctoral researcher and alumna Lei Wu, Ph.D. ('14), and Professor Diana S-L. Chow, Ph.D., are among a select group of investigators analyzing the contents of medication kits sent back to earth following resupply missions to the ISS. Supported by a $50,000 First Award Fellowship grant from the National Space Biomedical Research Institute, Wu is analyzing the concentrations of four medications from ISS medical kits flown on five missions of the Space X aerospace cargo-transportation system. \"We're trying to not only determine if any degradation of the drugs has occurred \u2014 which could be due to a variety of physical and environmental factors, such as vibration, radiation and humidity \u2014 but also characterize the degradation and perform comparative analysis to ground-based controls, so we can develop predictive models for drug stability, bioavailability and toxicity,\" Wu said. \"We're also generating bioequivalence estimates using control and the Space X formulations in an animal model.\" The work holds special meaning for Chow and Wu as the project was proposed by their late colleague and friend, UHCOP/UH alumna and adjunct faculty member ('75), who served as NASA's chief pharmacologist before her untimely passing in 2015 and had led early medication-degradation studies of experimental payloads aboard the ISS and a space shuttle flight in the late 2000s. The trio most recently worked together to evaluate the efficacy of intranasal gel formulations of scopolamine (INSCOP) for space motion sickness, which served as the basis of Wu's doctoral dissertation. The project involved administering the investigational new drug formulation of INSCOP to human clinical trial subjects in a simulated microgravity environment. The study found use of INSCOP provided rapid absorption, quicker onset, required a lower dose for efficacy, and a reduction in side effects commonly experienced with oral and transdermal formulations. ORBITAL DECAY ALUMNA EARNS NASA POST-DOC FELLOWSHIP TO STUDY IMPACT OF SPACEFLIGHT ON CREW MEDICATIONS FROM ISS MISSIONS University of Houston College of Pharmacy 47 Sofjan's AACP, SIDP Projects Span Houston to Pharmacy's Amelia K. Sofjan, Pharm.D., BCPS, clinical assistant professor, has received grants from the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists for respective studies on a potential U.S. epidemiological shift in a serious complication associated with cirrhotic patients and the prevalence of Clostridium difficile infection in Bangladesh. Supported by a $10,000 AACP New Investigator Award, Sofjan is conducting a retrospective epidemiological study to determine if there has been a change in the types of bacteria that cause spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in patients with end-stage liver disease. The complication is diagnosed in 1 in 4 cirrhotic patients hospitalized with bacterial infections, with 30-day mortality rates ranging from one-quarter to one-half of patients. The American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) now recommends the use of the third-generation cephalosporins as first-line therapy only for those patients with community-acquired SBP who were not previously exposed to broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics. Yet, the AASLD has made not specific recommendations for hospital-associated or -acquired SBP and suggests that empirical therapy is based on local epidemiology. Although relatively modest sample size, Sofjan's study to provide the local epidemiological data needed to appropriately select alternative empirical therapy is believed to be the largest of its kind in the U.S. \"Our project will not only identify the ceftriaxone-resistant pathogens, but also the risk factors for developing SBP from these resistant organisms and predictors of patient outcomes,\" she said. \"The goal is to develop a prediction score model for ceftriaxone-resistant organisms in cirrhotic patients with SBP and to create an empirical treatment algorithm for these patients.\" With a $10,000 grant awarded by SIDP and funded by rapid diagnostic testing company Alere, Sofjan and her UHCOP and Bangladesh-based collaborators are attempting to determine whether Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is an emerging, yet underreported, threat in the developing nation. While CDI constitutes a major concern in the U.S. and in Europe, it is considered \"nonexistent\" and rarely diagnosed in developing nations such as Bangladesh. However, backed by recent studies indicating the rise of CDI in hospitalized patients in Southeast Asia, the widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in Bangladesh and preliminary data identifying toxigenic strains of the bacteria in environmental samples from Bangladesh, Sofjan suggests that diagnosis of CDI is likely an area of urgent, unmet need in the country. \"Data from this study should represent the only epidemiological study of CDI in Bangladesh,\" Sofjan said. \"An accurate diagnosis of CDI is essential to alert clinicians to implement infection control measures, re-evaluate the need for antimicrobials and implement effective therapy.\" The project will utilize a U.S.-developed rapid diagnostic tool during the initial sample collection and identification from patients at a large tertiary care hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The positive samples will be sent to UHCOP to be cultured and strain typed, as well as compared to biobanked samples from Houston patients with positive CDI. Bench Notes Richard A.

Fleming, Ph.D., MPH, R.Ph., have initiated separate projects aimed at different targets \u2014 patients vs. prescribers \u2014 but with the ultimate shared goal of improving statin adherence and patient health outcomes. Supported by a two-year, $184,587 grant from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., Abughosh's study inv0lves identifying different patterns for low adherence, associated indicators and patients who fit within the parameters, then providing interventional counseling through motivational interviewing to boost adherence through patients' behavioral change. Abughosh's team applying a relatively new statistical method \u2014 called group-based trajectory models \u2014 to identify similar 12-month medication-filling behaviors among statin users aged 65 and older who are enrolled in a Texas-based Medicare Advantage plan. The second phase is a randomized trial to demonstrate the intervention benefit among 500 non-adherent health plan members contacted by Pharm.D. students trained in motivational interviewing. Adherence during the six months post-intervention will be evaluated for the intervention and control groups. Members of the study team include Fleming and fellow faculty members E. James Essien, M.D., DrPH, and Michael L. Johnson, Ph.D., as well as Medicare Advantage provider Cigna from Sanofi US, Fleming's project is exploring the factors resulting in sub-optimal prescribing of statin therapy in order to improve prescriber implementation of the clinical guidelines and ultimately medication adherence. \"Simple awareness of new guidelines \u2014 published roughly every 10 years \u2014 does not always lead to adoption,\" Fleming said. \"Guideline adoption requires the acquisition of specific knowledge and skills as well as procedures to facilitate the incorporation of these recommendations into daily practice. In addition, physicians' beliefs and attitudes prevent them from incorporating the recommendations.\" The study's specific objective is to assess the impact of a educational webinar on statin prescribing as a means to ultimately improve patient adherence among patients enrolled in a Texas Medicare Advantage plan. Assisting in the project are Abughosh, Mark Hatfield, PHOP Ph.D. ('16), UTHealth cardiologist. TEAM STRIKES GOLD IN 'DONUT HOLE' STUDY A collaborative project by researchers from academia, a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan provider and the pharmaceutical industry to identify \"coverage gap\" characteristics among Medicare-enrolled Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients received a Gold Medal from the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy. Members of the study team were from UH College of Pharmacy, Cigna HealthSpring and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), which partially supported the project honored at the 2016 AMCP & Specialty Pharmacy Annual Meeting. Using retrospective data of more than 3,000 COPD patients, the researchers identified patient age, Centers for Medicare Services risk score, and ER visits as predictors of entering the gap while low income subsidy level as an additional predictor of time to coverage. Project team members included, back row, UHCOP faculty members Sujit S. Sansgiry, Ph.D., and Marc L. Omar Serna, Pharm.D. Pharm.D., and Richard Stanford, Pharm.D. Fleming Abughosh University of Houston College of Pharmacy 49The UHCOP community has lost one of its longest-serving faculty members, Professor Emeritus Vishnu D. Gupta, Ph.D., who passed in August 2016. A cherished faculty member for nearly 50 years, Gupta will be remembered as a dedicated pharmaceutical researcher, educator and philanthropist. A UHCOP faculty member from 1967 to his retirement in 2015 almost one year to the day of passing, Gupta taught Pharmaceutics and Physical Pharmacy to thousands of professional pharmacy and graduate students over the course of his career at the college. Gupta earned his Ph.D. in Pharmaceutical Analysis and Physical Pharmacy from the University of Georgia and his M.S. in Manufacturing Pharmacy from The University of Texas. A Fellow of the Academy of Pharmaceutical Sciences and the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists, Gupta authored or co-authored hundreds of articles and chapters in peer-reviewed journals and books. His expertise in the areas of pharmaceutical analyses and stability studies made him a highly sought-after consultant and researcher to the pharmaceutical industry on a national and international level. Along with his wife, Mrs. Kanta K. Gupta, Vishnu Gupta was a longtime member of the college's Mading Society and the university's In Tempore Society. The Guptas generously supported the college and university, including creating four endowments for Pharm.D. and graduate students: for Pharm.D. and graduate students: the Anant Ram Gupta Presidential Endowed Scholarship, Dean Joseph P. Buckley Pharmacy Leadership Award, Yoginder Nath Goel & Swaran Lata Goel Academic Achievement Award, and the Vishnu D. & Kanta K. Gupta Scholarship. An avid international traveler, Gupta also was an ardent supporter of providing students the opportunity to expand their horizons by participating in professional and scientific meetings. In addition to providing assistance for student pharmacist mission trips, a planned gift made by the Guptas several years ago will support a future endowed travel fund. Gupta will be remembered as a kind, generous and modest man who sought to follow the teachings and examples set by the great Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi and his father, Anant Ram Gupta. \"I'm thankful to God for my success and good fortune, which has allowed me to put both of my children through higher Vishnu D.

It was a combination of knowledge, confidence, preparation and strategy that won the day for UHCOP Pharmaceutical Health Outcomes and Policy Navneet features an academic \"quiz-bowl\" style format in which questions from the official ISPOR Book of Terms and ISPOR Good Research Practices for Outcomes Research are posed to two teams in head-to-head competition. The first team to hit the buzzer and provide the correct answer receives points, but wrong answers \u2014 or even attempting to answer before being recognized \u2014 results in deduction of points. Open to any teams advancing from an initial qualifying round from the nearly 90 ISPOR student chapters around the world, the 11th annual Student Research Competition saw the UHCOP team climbing its way to the top in five-round bracket of 20 total teams. Not only did the team proudly sport UH Cougar Red polos, nearly two dozen fellow students, faculty members and alumni \u2014 many of whom were also decked out in UH's signature color \u2014 created a vocal and spirited cheering section in the crowd. \"We knew all the terms from our studies and research we do at the college, but it involved a lot of confidence and strategy \u2014 including when to let the other team answer first on the more difficult or complex questions and potentially lose points \u2014 to advance and win it,\" Upadhyay said. Another strategy the team employed was to play to the strengths of individual members. \"It really was a team effort; everyone answered questions, but we each had specific areas that we focused on during our practice sessions and in the competition itself,\" Sawant said. Team members also credited the advice and encouragement of their team coaches, fellow student and past competitor Nandita Kachru and Assistant Professor Marc L. Fleming, Ph.D., MPH, R.Ph., who was a member of a winning team during his doctoral degree studies. Kachru and other students helped the team prepare with mock quizzes employing timers and even a glass and spoon to simulate the response buzzer and paying close attention to following the rules of the competition. All four team members also had participated in at least one competition in previous years. \"The final round was very relaxed, and we even stop answering the questions because we were so far ahead in points that we could only hurt ourselves if we happened to get a question wrong or accidentally answered without being recognized by the moderator,\" said Upadhyay, the most experienced member of the team with two previous appearances. Winning the 2016 competition was extra rewarding for the UHCOP team, as the win not only came with a cash prize for the college's ISPOR student chapter but also taking out the competing team that eliminated UHCOP in the first round of last year's competition. The 2016 win is a first for the college, with previous teams finishing second in 2010 and third in 2014. \"It's great recognition for the program and the students individually; I was really proud to see their elation at winning,\" Fleming said. \"The judges are leaders in the industry, so it's a big deal when you win it.\" At left, members of the ISPOR championship and, coaches Marc Fleming, assistant professor, and student Nandita Kachru were credited for their hard work preparing the team for victory. The final round was very relaxed, and we even stop answering the questions because we were so far ahead in points that we could only hurt ourselves... \u2014 Navneet Upadhyay, PHOP Ph.D. Candidate and ISPOR Student Research Competition Team Member UH College of Pharmacy Pharm.D. students continue to uphold the college's reputation as a leader in producing exceptional pharmacy practitioners in the area of clinical skills and patient care \u2014 and 2016 was no exception. Leading the way at the national level were Pharm.D. candidates Natalie Chu and David Pham, who won the Division 2 (P3-P4 years) of the SNPhA/Kroger National Clinical Skills Competition at the Student National Pharmaceutical Association's 2016 National Convention July 29-31 in Atlanta. Chu and Pham were among 64 teams competing from pharmacy colleges/schools across the U.S. Unlike other events of its kind, the SNPhA format is an integrated clinical skills and patient counseling competition: Competitors not only must prepare and present the patient case \u2014 including identifying the primary, secondary and tertiary problems, recommended goals of therapy, and monitoring parameters \u2014 but also interact with a standardized patient for a medication counseling session. A first-time competitor in any live clinical skills competition aside from taking part in the preliminary online rounds of the American College of Clinical Pharmacy's competition, Chu said she nonetheless felt prepared for the SNPhA event. \"I didn't know what to expect, so I relied on David to coach me in what to expect,\" Chu said. \"However, we had just completed our P3 year. Every Monday for an entire year in Therapeutics class, we had to work up and present SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes, which are basically the same format and elements as what was required in the clinical skills competition.\" \"I think the combined format was interesting and challenging because during the case presentation and panel Q&A, you had to be very professional and speak in scientific terms to justify your recommendations, then do a 180-degree turn and remove all medical jargon and talk with the patient using terms they can understand,\" Pham said. Even though the pairing of the team was a bit unplanned \u2014 Chu's original teammate had to back out due to her rotation schedule \u2014 Chu and Pham said they were able to capitalize on each other's strengths to advance and triumph. \"I think our ability to think quickly and on our feet in those situations is attributable to how involved we've been in the college's curriculum,\" Pham said. \"UHCOP has this culture of being involved and you know that immediately as a P1. Through our involvement in student organizations and leadership positions, you have the opportunity to refine your communication and public-speaking skills that I think really helped us in the presentation phase. \"After the competition, I've had the opportunity to reflect on what we've gone through from P1 to P4 and realize how UHCOP has prepared us clinically to handle these types of competitions and situations with people skills and critical thinking skills. It's CLINICALLY COMPETITIVE FIRST- AND FOURTH-YEAR STUDENTS BRING HOME TITLES FROM STATE, NATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS COMPETITIONS 56 University of Houston College of Pharmacy University of Houston College of Pharmacy 57 UH SNPHA AMONG NATIONAL CHAPTER FINALISTS Although UH College of Pharmacy's chapter of the Student National Pharmaceutical Association wasn't able to retain its title as Chauncey I. Cooper National Chapter of the Year in 2016, it did climb into the top three among chapters competing in the Large Category at the SNPhA National Convention July 29-31 in Atlanta. During the 2015-16 year, the chapter participated in nearly 140 events and impacted more than 4,400 patients through a range of wellness screenings and educational outreach activities. Other highlights of the chapter's initiatives during the 2015-16 year included: Establishing a shadowing program with a kidney transplant pharmacy specialist and facilitating member training as certified Kidney Health Educators through the American Kidney Fund; Providing smoking cessation for residents at Houston's Angela House, a transitional facility for women released from incarceration for nonviolent offenses; and Working with SMART Cougars, a UH organization that offers free HIV testing, to provide the screenings at a health fair hosted by a Houston church.In addition, the chapter's Remember the Ribbon Initiative took third place in the nation for its activities during the 2015-16 academic year and a presentation at the meeting. Highlights of the chapter's Remember the Ribbon activities included participating in more than 30 events with an impact of nearly 300 patients and community members, providing more than 180 service hours at the Bering Omega House HIV/AIDS hospice facility, and raising nearly $1,500 in cash and food donations for Omega House and the AIDS Foundation. The chapter also was successful in securing passage of its resolution to establish a collaboration between SNPhA and the American Lung Association in which SNPhA members can be trained as facilitators to present asthma education programs at underserved primary schools. kind of funny to think back and see that we really were prepared, but we just didn't realize it.\" In addition to individual awards, Chu and Pham's national title also secured a $1,000 prize for the UHCOP chapter, which they hope to see used to develop a local version of the competition. Following up on UHCOP wins in the P2 and P4 divisions at the 2015 event, Stephanie Crowley and Diane Dreucean claimed the P1 division title at the Texas Society of Health-System Pharmacists' 2016 Clinical Skills Competition. In the TSHP competition, the two-person teams are required to develop a therapeutic plan and recommendations based on a review of the patient's medical chart and consulting appropriate clinical/pharmaceutical references. Teams are scored based on their documentation, presentation and aptitude during a follow-up question-and-answer session. \"The case was definitely tough this year based on what we knew about past cases; our patient had multiple serious problems and complications, and her medication list was quite long,\" Dreucean said. \"It was challenging to put together a plan with minimal drug-drug interactions that covered all of her disease states.\"I couldn't have done it without Stephanie. We each have areas of pharmacotherapy that we are more familiar with, and split our cases so that we could maximize our time and effectiveness. Overall, it is a great experience and really strengthened our knowledge of drug therapy.\" Stephanie Crowley and Diane Dreucean captured first place in the P1 Division of the 2016 TSHP Clinical Skills Competition. SNPhA Chapter members celebrate their success at the 2016 National Convention. Third-year Pharm.D. student Shawn Ahmad was elected President-elect of the Texas Pharmacy Association's Student Leadership Group at the 2016 TPA Annual Meeting & Expo in July. Ahmad has been passionate about pharmacy advocacy since his P1 year: After attending the UHCOP-student organized Legislative Forum and attending the TPA Day at the Dome, Ahmad was motivated to join the SLG and secured his appointment as Education Chair. Ahmad also has been working to establish a student-focused Professional Recovery Network among Texas pharmacy colleges/schools and increasing awareness among students of pharmacists' role in addressing substance abuse/addiction.TPA STUDENT PRESIDENT-ELECT Two third-year Pharm.D. students - Shutian Ju and Brian Nwokorie - were appointed to National Initiative Chair leadership positions in the Student National Pharmaceutical Association at the 2016 SNPhA National Convention July 29-31.

University of Houston College of Pharmacy 59Alumni News A Perfect Blend for Roux Clinical Pharmacy, Leadership Mix Earns ASHP Fellow Status, Career Success for Alumnus UH College of Pharmacy alumnus Ryan Roux, Pharm.D., M.S., is one of those unique stories of someone entering the profession somewhat by happenstance but whose aptitude and receptivity to both new ideas and prudent advice have catapulted him into the upper echelons of leaders in health-system pharmacy. The Louisiana native first became aware of pharmacy as a career while pursuing a double-major in chemistry and biology at Stephen F. Austin State University. Roux got to know East Texas community pharmacist Monte Ethington, R.Ph. ('91), an alumnus of both UHCOP and SFA. The more Roux learned about the profession from Ethington and others, the more the stars seemed to align. As a UHCOP Pharm.D. student, Roux's involvement in organizations gave him some of his earliest exposure to leadership. Although originally set on a clinical pharmacy track, he followed the recommendation of a mentor and former UHCOP faculty member, Dana Fitzsimmons, and pursued the M.S./health-system pharmacy administration residency program at The Ohio State University/The Ohio State University Medical Center. \"That was the hardest two years of my life, but it got me to where I am today because of how the program is designed to provide you with a foundation to handle difficult situations, manage negotiations, and overcome various challenges in your career,\" he said. Roux said his experiences in pharmacy school and the M.S./ residency program gave him the opportunity to build and cultivate over the subsequent years his most valued asset: a network of mentors populated by respected leaders in the profession. \"Roger Anderson, Joyce Tipton, Lourdes Cuellar, Todd Karpinski, Brian Cohen, my leadership team and colleagues at my institution \u2014 these are just a few people who have made, and still make, an impact in my career,\" he said. \"Throughout my career and continuing today, I've had the opportunity to work with amazing managers who make it easy to dream big and help materialize those dreams into reality.\" After returning to Houston, Roux began a 12-year career ascension from operations manager to chief pharmacy officer at Harris Health System. Roux is now director of Pharmacy Operations at The University of Texas-MD Anderson Cancer. His leadership positions have been marked by successfully developing and implementing an array of quality, performance, cost-reduction and clinical service expansion initiatives. His work has encompassed everything from revising policies and procedures in line with regulatory standards/best practices, improving pharmacist-patient and pharmacist-nursing staff relationships to migrating to an electronic health record, selecting and upgrading carousels and dispensing cabinets, and creating and monitoring discharge counseling/transitions of care programs. A UHCOP adjunct faculty member, Roux also was instrumental in the launch of the two-year concurrent M.S.-PGY1/PGY2 Houston Program in Pharmacy Leadership and Administration in 2009 (as well as bringing in MD Anderson two years later). Previously recognized as a Fellow of the Texas Society of Health- System Pharmacists, Roux was honored at the national level this summer as a Fellow of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists. \"It was very humbling to be among such an accomplished group; the significance of it really didn't sink in until I saw those who'd come before me \u2014 as well as those in my own class \u2014 and started getting congratulatory emails from some very influential leaders in health care.\" 60 University of Houston College of PharmacyUHCOP Honors Cuellar as Alumnus of the Year With his genuinely friendly and gracious demeanor and soft-spoken kindness, it's easy to easy to see how UH College of Pharmacy alumnus Celso Cuellar Jr. is the epitome of the pharmacist who places special emphasis on the \"care\" in \"patient care.\" In recognition of serving his community's health needs for more than 50 years and his generosity in support of his alma mater, Dean F. Lamar Pritchard proudly bestowed the UHCOP's 2016 Alumnus Pharmacist of the Year Award to Cuellar. \"Like myself, Celso grew up in a pharmacy, so we have a shared connection in how the neighborhood or town pharmacist is viewed in the community,\" said Dean F. Lamar Pritchard, Ph.D., R.Ph. \"As our profession continues to advance, we should nonetheless strive to hold dear the timeless values and character of pharmacists such as Celso by always keeping our patient's well-being foremost in mind. Celso truly has Cougar Red blood pumping through a heart of gold.\" Cuellar, who continues to work relief in his native San Antonio at the Hill's Drug Store No. 1 owned by UHCOP classmate Arthur Jamie Siller, R.Ph., said he was \"overwhelmed and very humbled by the honor and the number of people who congratulated me.\" Although not a pharmacist himself, Cuellar's late father and namesake owned a pharmacy in San Antonio where the younger Celso and his siblings grew up. \"I remember starting as a delivery boy riding my bicycle to make deliveries, then I moved up to flipping burgers and making floats at the soda fountain \u2014 so customer service was always very natural for me,\" Cuellar said. Cuellar fondly called back to the early days of his career working for Mading Drugs in Clear Lake, near the entrance to the NASA Johnson Space Center. \"It was such an exciting time; we'd have astronauts come into the pharmacy, and although they were 'down to earth,' they really were celebrities,\" he said. \"At the time, transmissions between the astronauts and Mission Control were broadcast on public radio and, if you drove down the street with your windows open, you could practically listen to the broadcasts the whole way because everybody up and down the street were tuned in.\" Bringing a humble humanitarianism with him wherever he went, Cuellar's career included pharmacist and management positions with Kmart and Target, as well as an independent pharmacy owner for 16 years. \"What always brought me great satisfaction is the one-on-one interaction with the patients and being humbled by the great trust they have in you, especially when you're working in communities who may not have the financial resources that others have. They would seek your advice and opinion about investments and other things outside of my area of expertise, which says a lot about how much trust and respect they had in the family pharmacist.\" University of Houston College of Pharmacy 61What always brought me great satisfaction is the one-on-one interaction with the patients... \u2014 Celso Cuellar1960 s Several members of the UHCOP Class of 1966 participated in the Golden Cougar Walk during the May 2016 Graduation Commencement ceremony.

No matter where you work and live, you can stay involved with the student-to-alumni experience. Invite a local student to attend a pharmacy conference, make time to sit and develop that mentor-mentee relationship, listen and learn about new advancements through a student pharmacist perspective, and challenge yourself to adapt and excel the profession together. We recognize that each of you may be in a different stage of life, whether you just graduated, are newly employed, advancing your career or starting a family, making a move into a second career, or merging into retirement. Whichever stage you are in, you share that important common thread: The University of Houston College of Pharmacy. You are an integral part of a network that spans generations and that lasts a lifetime. Please join me in making this a rewarding year.

Houston Alumni SocialHouston Reunion University of Houston College of Pharmacy 67PK/PD PIONEER With the passing of alumna Lakshmi Putcha in September 2015, her family, friends and neighbors not only lost an individual described as a \"force of nature,\" but the world lost a true pioneer and innovator whose vast impact in the exploration of space \u2014 and the role of women in science \u2014 may never be fully measured. Innovators in their own right, her husband, Mallik Putcha, and their son, Girish Putcha, M.D., Ph.D., have established the Dr. Lakshmi Putcha Endowment in Pharmaceutics to assist aspiring young scientists with their education. Putcha served as chief pharmacologist at NASA-Johnson Space Center and technical manager of the Pharmacotherapeutics Laboratories at JSC. She earned two master's degrees, including an M.S. in Pharmacy, and a doctorate in Biopharmaceutics and Clinical Pharmacokinetics from UH. Putcha started her NASA career as a post-doctoral fellow in 1982 and went on to develop cutting-edge applications for astronaut health care operations in space and on Earth. As the only clinical pharmacologist at NASA, she was responsible for directing and conducting the research and development program for optimizing pharmacotherapeutics in space. Her contributions to the field of pharmacotherapeutics include significantly expanding knowledge of the wide-ranging effects of spaceflight on humans, as well as resolving critical human health and safety issues for future missions, including ones to Mars. Her contributions to NASA research were studies on the bioavailability and performance effects of promethazine during spaceflight and bioavailability pharmacodynamics of promethazine in human subjects; bioavailability of scopolamine dosage forms and combination dosage form with dextroamphetamine after oral administration in human subjects; pharmacokinetics (PK) and contributing physiological changes Giving News FAMILY CREATES ENDOWMENT IN MEMORY OF LATE ALUMNA, NASA CHIEF PHARMACOLOGIST during spaceflight; a methods-validation protocol for estimating gastrointestinal (GI) motility and drug-induced motility changes; and the effects of simulated microgravity on PK and GI function. A sampling of the technologies and drug systems she pioneered at NASA include novel technology proof-of-concept studies on a patented biological same preservative technology; portable microfluidic chemical detection spinning-disk atomization. A Fellow of the American College of Clinical Pharmacology, Dr. Putcha held adjunct faculty appointments at several institutions, including UHCOP. Putcha was the recipient of numerous honors and awards at NASA, including the Special Space Flight Achievement Award, Certificate of Commendation and Space Act Award, as well as research support from such entities as the National Institutes of Health and the National Space Biomedical Research Institute. 68 University of Houston College of PharmacyDr. Putcha was driven by an insatiable curiosity and an uncompromising pursuit for excellence. In her own words, the guiding principle of her life was, \"if you can dream it, you can achieve it.\" This passion infused all aspects of her personality \u2014 she was a rasika (musical connoisseur) in the truest sense of the word; a gardener and botanist extraordinaire; a gifted writer; and a fount of wisdom and experience.

The Caesars recently established the Greg and Linda Vu Caesar Endowed Scholarship to assist UH students in the professional pharmacy or nursing programs. In recognition of their gift, the Caesars were among the college's 2015 Mading Society inductees. Linda Vu Caesar was a member of the second UHCOP Pharm.D. graduating class in 1998, drawn to the profession's foundation in biology and chemistry. The Houston native fondly remembers the program \u2014 and profession \u2014 searching for its new identity in a rapidly evolving health care environment. \"There were a lot of similarities to a medical program when we went through, but I don't know if anyone did what we did \u2014 a lot of gross anatomy, and even observing an autopsy,\" Linda said. \"But, it was a tremendous experience that gave many of us a sense of being part of something that was progressive and cutting-edge. \"The idea of reinventing yourself and your profession is something that I continually try to stress to our students: You have to go out every day with the mindset of serving not just one \u2014 the patients \u2014 but also the physicians, the nurses, your fellow pharmacists, and the entire organization.\" After graduation, Linda completed a PGY1 residency at South Texas Methodist Hospital in San Antonio before returning to Houston. She recently marked 13 years with Memorial Hermann Health System, including a decade at The Woodlands Hospital where she is an internal medicine/ICU pharmacist and preceptor. \"I love it; you're on the floor, doing interventions, medication- use evaluations, working on a multidisciplinary team,\" Linda said. Originally from the Carolinas, Greg graduated from Virginia Tech with a chemical engineering degree in 1998 and moved to Houston to work at the Exxon (now ExxonMobil) Refinery in Baytown as a project/process engineer. He now works as a commercial manager at ExxonMobil's headquarters in The Woodlands. \"We're at a position in our careers to give back and help the younger generation see how they can make a difference,\" Greg said. \"We were blessed to come to the realization where you're a dual career family, you've recovered from college debts, bought a home, etc., and look for opportunities to give back.\" In setting up their endowment, the Caesars took advantage of a three-to-one matching program at ExxonMobil. The Caesars said they hoped their gift would not only help students achieve their education and career goals, but also illustrate the importance of education to their 10- and 7-year-old boys and potentially encourage others to make an investment in the future. \"We want to encourage the perspective of not looking at your job simply as what it can give you, but what you can give to the profession, whatever that may be,\" Linda said. 0073017883 Non-Profit Org.
