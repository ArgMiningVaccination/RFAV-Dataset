Iowa -Thur-.d<1y, February 8, 2001 -3A CITY & NATION COGS opposes doctoral fee hikes The union gains respect of some Ul undergrads. By Jeae Elliott The Daily Iowan More than 60 members of C()GS, the graduate students' union, showed up outside Gilmore Hall Wednesday afternoon to voice their oppo\u00b7 sition to a \u00b7fee increase for some doctoral students. The current $70 semester registration fee for on-campus post-comprehensive graduate students will be increased nearly six-fold, to $412', on July 1, the UI administration recently announced. Such students no longer take classes but continue to use UI resources to complete their dissertations . Typically, the UI has approximately 500 of these students, who also hold teaching positions in sev\u00ad eral departments. Graduate instructor Jon Williams-Searle and his wife, Bridgett Williams-Searle, said the increase will have serious repercussions on the quality of dissertation work and education of UI under\u00ad graduates . They fear financial limitations will cause. several highly qualified graduate stu\u00b7 dents who currently assist professors in classrooms and lead their own classes to flee the Ul. \"This is an attempt by (the un to speed along dissertation work,\" said Williams-Searle, who has been at the UI since 1991. Ul sophomores Mike Reynoldson and Jason King, who looked on as the mem\u00ad bers marched in circles on the sidewalks outside of Gilmore and Pappajohn Business Building, said they supported the protesters' cause. Reynoldson said teaching assistants are valuable assets because \"they are easi\u00b7 ScoH Morgan/The Daily Iowan Ul graduate student Mike Evces speaks during a rally outside the Pappajohn Business Building Wednesday afternoon as other grad\u00ad uate employee union members picket with signs. er to learn from, treat stu\u00ad dents more personally, \u00b7do much of a professor's work, and are more willing to help students than professors are.\" Two of Reynoldson's four classes are taught by graduate students. Graduate instructor Heather Kopelson, the COGS campus chief steward, was part of the six-member nego\u00ad tiating team that met with administrators in a 2 p.m. cl6sed-door meeting. She said the meeting would tackle not only the potential fee increase but aJso such issues as tuition wavers and child\u00ad care services. The union and the adminis\u00ad tration have been negotiating a two-year contract for more than three months. If the two sides do not reach an agreement by Feb. 23, an arbitrator will take over_ A final contract must be presented to the state by March 15. \u00b7 The UI is the only Big Ten school without a uniform tuition-waver policy for grad\u00ad uate teaching and research assistants. \"On the bright side, our salaries have gone way up,\" said Brfdgett Williams-Searle. \"But what (the Ul) give(s) us in salary, it takes away in tuition.\" As her daughter, Chloe, trooped along beside her, Bridget Williams-Searle also said UI teaching assistants lack childcare. \"The probiem is, they con\u00ad ce).ve of us as older under\u00ad graduates, which we're not,\" she said. \"'Many of us are back at school after having worked professional jobs for five years, and we bring our fami\u00ad lies and our experiences with us.\" \u00b7 At least a few undergraduate students are concerned they will be left without the aid of graduate students if COGS is unsuccessful in gaining salary, tuition/fee and childcare conces\u00ad sions in the negotiations process. \"Without them, we would have fewer discussion sections -one of the most valuable aspects of our education,\" said UI sophomore Brandon Wojcik, who has three graduate-led courses this semester. \"I sup\u00ad port what they're doing here today.\" Of reporter Jeue Elliott can be reached at: Jesse-eiiiOtt@uiowa 2001 Nissan Altima GXE system, power door lodes, power 3-way driver's seat, remote, keyless entry, vehicle security system and much more! , inventory at www.nissaniowa.com t ~I~!~!~w,I.~!.5!~!!.~~~~!!

Iowa Thursday, 2001 CITY Ch1rlle Curtin/The Daily Iowan Sarah Loebsack, a Mercy Hospital phlebotomist, draws blood from Ul sophomore Amy Delperdang during the bone marrow drive at the IMU Wednesday afternoon. Locals take part in bone marrow drive Donors give about two tablespoons of their blood in hope c>f helping others. By Jackie Hannnen The Daily Iowan More than 180 people added their names to a national bone marrow donation registry Wednesday as part of UI Pro\u00ad ject Marrow's second registra\u00ad tion drive. Six million people worldwide have registered themselves as donors, Colleen Chapleau, associate director of the Iowa Marrow Donor Program said. Of patients who need trans\u00ad plants, 75 percent do not have a match in their family. Com\u00ad patibility requires donor and patient to have the same tissue type, which is significantly more complicated than blood types, she said. \"You are transplanting an immune system. That is why you only make a donation if you match a patient undergoing a transplant,\" Chapleau said. Most marrow transplant patients have leukemia and have exhausted ~II other resources available to treat their disease. \"It is the last chance for them to survive,\" Chapleau said. Roughly 3,000 patients are looking for a match at any given time and half of them will not find a donor, she said. To register, donors give about two tablespoons of blood and fill out a medical history form with contact information. Project Marrow president . and UI senior Jonathan Titus said he helped create UI Pro\u00ad ject Marrow after becoming a bone marrow donor. He said he became a match for someone about a year after adding his name to the registry. \"It was on October 21, 1999. It's like a new birthday or an anniversary for me. It is pretty special,\" Titus said of the date he gave bone marrow. Titus said the outpatient procedure for removing mar\u00ad row from his hip bone and recovery afterward were easy. \"My surgery was 45 minutes long,\" he said. \"I was a little . sore. It felt like I fell on the ice or something . I went for a three\u00ad mile run three days later.\" A procedure using donors' stem cells are more commonly used now. A donor receives Fil\u00ad grastim injections before sur\u00ad gery, causing marrow to filter into the. blood stream. Blood is removed, stem cells are extract\u00ad ed and the rest is put back in the donor's body, Titus said. Anyone who registers stays on the list until he or she is 61 years old. Younger people are encour\u00ad aged to join because they will have a longer span of time to donate and because their marrow may be more effective. \"From studies, we now know that patients who receive cells from younger donors (18-30) tend to do better,\" Chapleau said. \"I hate needles, but I have always been interested in helping someone else with my marrow,\" UI sophomore Jennifer Moser said after registering Wednesday. Dl reporter JICtll Hammers can be reached at: jackie_hammers@hotmail .com Kirkwood elementary program head embezzles Kirkwood After School Program supervisor embezzled over $10,000. By Jesse Elliott The Daily Iowan The Kirkwood Kares before and after school program has refused to let the embezzle\u00ad ment of over $10,000 from its treasury halt operations, said current treasurer Nancy Raaf. Katherine Thede-Reynolds, 44, who served as volunteer treasur\u00ad er of the Kirkwood Kares after school program at Kirkwood Ele\u00ad mentary School from September of 1997 until May of2000, turned herself over to the Coralville police Wednesday afternoon for 1the theft of more than $10,000 from the program's treasury. Thede-Reynolds made several small withdrawals -the first one in the amount of $300 dollars -from the program's bank account over the two-and-a-half year period, said Coralville Police ChiefBarry Bedford. But Kirkwood Kares -a parent-operated, not-for-profit organization which uses space in Kirkwood Elementary School to provide childcare - has already moved on. \"We're fine now,\" said Raaf, who, along with other parents and children in the program, made up for the financial shortfall through fundraisers, such as cleaning the Hawkeye Village and Kinnick Stadium after football games this fall. Kirkwood Kares, which has an average of 45 students per day in its before and after school pro\u00ad grams, is-now so financially sta\u00ad ble that it is even looking to expand its p~into the summer months, Riaf said. Though it felt a financial ' strain at the beginning of the school year, the grol.tp did not suspect that anything was wrong, Raaf said. The group of volunteer par\u00ad ents first found discrepranices in the bank account of Kirk-. wood Kares in October, but had no idea of the alleged financial improprieties . The volunteer board that runs the program was in process of finding a new director and was getting its financial information together to see how much it could offer the director when it came across the sutprisingly low funds, Raaf said. \"'t just didn't look right,\" she said. \"And we were concerned .\" The group felt it was not equipped to handle the matter and turned it over to the Coralville Police Department, which began its own investiga\u00ad tion headed by Detective Doug Vance in October. Bedford said the Police Department charged Thede\u00ad Reynolds with 1st degree theft -a theft of over $10,000 - Wednesday night, notifying her attorney. Early Wednesday afternoon, Thed~-Reynolds had turned herself into the police without incident. Thede-Reynolda, who could not be reached for comment, was seen by a judge this morn\u00ad ing and released, on her own recognizance. Iowa City School District Superintendent Lane Plugge said before and after school childcare programs in the area operate independently of the schools themselves, although the district allows free use of building space for programs such as Kirkwood Kares. 01 rtpOrtlr\"\"\" Bllol.can be rt~ched It: jeue-elllottOulowudu Ul debate gay rights They discuss the issue and Vilsack's ban on employment discrimination at Wednesday's monthly debate. By Sara Falwell The Dally Iowan A year ago, Gov. 'Ibm Vtlsack signed an executive order to ban employment discrimination based on sexual orientation . A Republican legislative lawsuit challenged him, saying Vilsack exceeded his powers and the lawsuit was upheld in court. This issue of employment discrimination now rests in the hands of a Iowa Legislature committee until it holds hear\u00ad ings addressing the proposed law. UI seniors Michael Roston and Andy Peterson argued both sides of the issue Wednes\u00ad day night during a monthly debate sponsored by the A. Craig Baird Debate Forum at the UI Boyd Law Building. Roston started out by stating his position that the state should ban employment discrimination based on sexual orientation . He said that since people have made the choice to be honest with themselves and to other people about their lifestyle, they should be protected. \"This is pure economic injustice,\" he said. He explained that he was not suggesting that a quota of homo\u00ad sexual people should be hired, but that it is unfair to hire or fire based on sexual orientation. Peterson said this issue brings up a strategy question of how to incorporate tolerance into society. His main point throughout the debate w th t legislature is not the corr ct way to combat diRCrimlnntion .

By Karen Gullo Associated Press WASHINGTON -Vice President Dick Cheney's deci\u00ad sion to cancel a troubled stealth jet program won him praise a decade ago. Now, however, it threatens to earn him unwanted attention in an upcoming civil trial that could cost taxpayers $2 billion. A Republican-appointed federal judge has already said that Cheney, while defense secretary under for\u00b7 mer President Bush, forced the contract cancellation without understanding the proper procedures . The judge also cited inconsistencies in Cheney's testimony . The case, set for trial in May, pits the government against two of the biggest defense contractors, General Dynamics Corp and Boeing Co., which acquired McDon\u00ad nell Douglas Corp., the other original contractor .

The president promises to work with Israel's new Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. By Barry Schweld Associated Press WASHINGTON- President Bush pledged to work with Israel's incoming prime minis\u00b7 ter, hard-line leader Ariel Sharon, to promote peace in the Middle East. \"We're going to play the hand we've been dealt, n he said, \"and we're going to play it well.\" Bush said he talked to defeated Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Wednesday and told him \"he fought the valiant fight and he assured me he .supported attempts to bring calm to the region.\" \"We will continue to work with the parties in that region to promote an environment of calm,\" Bush said in a question\u00ad and-answer session afl:er pro\u00b7 moting his $1.6 trillion tax-cut plan.

By Karin Laub Associated Press JERUSALEM Ariel Sharon, flush from an election victory seen as a mandate to veto more concessions to the Palestinians, pledged in a sym\u00ad bolic pilgrimage to Judaism's Western Wall on Wednesday that Jerusalem will remain in Israeli hands forever. Sharon's promise, delivered the day after his decisive win over incumbent Prime Minister Ehud Barak, ran directly count\u00ad er to a key Palestinian demand for control over Jerusalem's walled Old City and its holy . shrines. However, Sharon aides were quick to portray Israel's new leader as a pragmatist the Palestinians will be able to do business with. \"Sharon wants to bring peace,\" said an adviser, Raanan Gissin. \"I certainly believe the Arabs . .. know they may not get everything they want, but it will be a real agree\u00ad ment.\" Sharon aides suggested Wednesday that -contrary to reports during the campaign - he would be willing to carry out territorial concessions in the West Bank and even dismantle some settlements. Reuven Rivlin, a lawmaker from Sharon's Likud Party, told Israel TV this would involve \"uniting\" some islands of Pales\u00ad tinian autonomy in the West Bank, which could involve the dismantling of some isolated Jewish settlements . Palestinian officials said they were ready to hear Sharon's offers. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat told Sharon in a congrat\u00ad ulatory message that his hands \"remain stretched out in peat:e,\" according to Sharon's advisers. Arafat advisers said they were unaware of such a mes\u00ad sage, but that they expected the leaders to make direct contact soon. Palestinians said they would not contemplate any Israeli pro\u00ad posals that fall short of Barak's most recent offer -.oe Palestin\u00ad ian state in virtually all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as parts of Jerusalem. Sharon has ruled out such con\u00ad cessions, and said he wouldn't begin talks until violence ends. After a four-hour meeting in Gaza, Arafat's Cabinet issued a statement calling on Israel to resume peace negotiations from the point at which they left. off, and calling for international supervision of renewed peace talks. \"Only peace can guarantee security for Israelis and Pal \u00b7 tinians,\" the statement said. Arafat, meanwhile, came under pressure to ostracize Sharon, widely reviled among Palestinians as a ruthless oppressor. Arafat's Fatah move\u00ad ment, which has led a bloody insurgency against Israel, demanded that he not resume peace talks as long as Sharon is in power.

DNR division administrator Liz Christiansen said only $4.1 million in the Groundwater Protection Fund is unobligat -ed. After the $6.5 million for the heating bill is reappropri\u00b7 ated, the fund will face a $2.4 million shortfall, she said. \"There will be projects that will be dropped, some that will be postponed and some that will go forward, but right now we're still evaluating everything,\" Christiansen said. 01 reponer year, rroupa r 1 r amount of money, d we couldn't pouibly mod l 11 of them aupply the rest of the nt organizations on s, aaid Ul 1 nior Fr man, chairman of Stud nt A embly and Auditinr funds to UI Lecture Committee, although the rec\u00ad ommendation is still far less than what the group original\u00ad ly requested .

He said the group will try to keep tickets as inexpensive as possible, and may imple\u00ad ment a ticket discount for students because their fees help fund the organization.

The weekly newspaper went to press for the last time on Jan. 25 after publishing regu\u00ad larly for the past seven years. The paper has ceased publish\u00ad ing because of financial trou\u00ad bles; it will attempt to resume publication in the future if a investor or buyer is found. The Joss of the alternative paper is a great travesty to this liberal college town. The paper provided a venue for the alternative voices, attitudes and ideas in the community. It is something different from what the other papers in the town have to offer. Rather than only offering hard news The loss of the alternative paper is a great travesty to this liberal college town. on a daily basis, Icon offered in-depth feature articles and editorials on a wide ranil'e of topics that cannot be found in a paper under the strict dead\u00ad lines of a daily newspaper . One of the nice advantages of Icon that helped to fuel its popularity was that it was free. For those Iowa City resi\u00ad dents who don't receive The Daily Iowan for free and can't afford a subscription to the other two daily newspapers, the free weekly may have been their only source of print news they had. The paper was sup\u00ad ported by advertisers rather than a subscription fee, some-thing that added to the uniqueness of the paper. Any time there is a closing of an alternative business in Iowa City, whether it is in the media, on the Pedestrian Mall or scattered throughout the city, it's a disappointment that affects a great percentage of the community. Circulation throughout the Iowa City and Cedar Rapids area was approximately 40,000, making it a very popular paper. If an investor or buyer could be found to take over the financial responsibilities of the paper, publication is likely to resume. This town already supports three local newspa\u00ad pers; adding a fourth would not be very difficult if the com\u00ad munity helped to support it. Carolyn Kresser is a 01 editorial writer. Stopping a recession requires economical optimism ... Have faith in the economy After several quarters of mediocre economic movement and the resulting plummet in consumer confidence, the debate about whether we are in a recession is going to begin. Democrats will blame Republicans for the .economy and Republicans will blame Bill Clinton. Economists will do pretty much the same thing as the politicians; after all, they have political sympathies as well. But the economists will use bigger words than the poli~icians do when casting blame. A recession is a phenomenon that is as much psychological as economic. A recession results from a lack of money circulating through the econo\u00ad my. When people stop spend\u00ad ing money, money stops circu\u00ad lating. But there are two rea\u00ad sons why people don't spend The president needs to make good on his promises of bipartisanship before he alienates Democrats. money. 1) They don't have money to spend. 2) They believe that the future will be bad, so they save the money that they have. And so, the very belief that the economy is b can actually keep the economy bad. If a recession materializes, it should be confronted on both of these fronts. Economically speaking, taxes should be cut, the death tax removed, the capital-gains tax lowered, interest rates cut and govern\u00ad ment spending lowered. But the battle against the mob mentality is a much harder fight. People are not going to spend money unless they CHARM \\NITIATIVE # 1 WHITE HOUSE THEATER believe that the future is going to be economically stable.

The court ruled that the right for \"single women and married couples to choose whether or not to have cbil\u00b7 dren\" was protected by the Ninth Amendment. In January 1973, the court gave women the right to choose and, in effect, gave them the right to privacy in their individual decision whether to continue pre\u00ad ganancy or to abort. In recent times, former President Clinton vetoed leg\u00ad islation that would have completely outlawed \"partial\u00ad birth\" abortions. Canady, House representa\u00ad tive from Florida, said, \" ... Bill Clinton will go down in history as the president whose veto had to be overrid\u00ad den in order to protect the innocent babies from a bru\u00ad tal, heinous death.\" Wait just one minute. What if it were discovered in the seventh month of preg\u00ad nancy that both the baby and the mother would die during birth? Two dead. Two human beings. Can you in good conscience OUTLAW \u00ad completely, 100 percent - the option of abortion? There are simply too many possible exceptions to a hard\u00ad and-fast rule. I will admit, however, that abortion may be overused . Abortion is NOT birth con\u00ad trol. But there was a lime when birth control was ille\u00b7 gal, too.

I am disappointed that the University of Iowa is not showing the leadership and courage required to make the statement that, although singing \"the beer song\" may seem innocent to many, alco\u00ad hol is a dangerous drug and making light of its use will no longer be a part of University of Iowa culture.

By RoYBrt Burns Associated Press WASHINGTON -Iran and Iraq are likely to pose major security challenges to the new Bush administration in their illicit pursuit of nuclear, chem\u00ad ical and biological weapons and in Iran's growing support for terrorism, the CIA director told Congress on Wednesday. Summarizing the CIA's assessment of security threats around the world, George Tenet said international terrorism is the most immediate worry, and foremost among the threats is the Muslim extremist network of Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi who has declared holy war on America. \"Osama bin Laden and his global network of lieutenants and associates remain the most immediate and serious threat,\" Tenet told the Senate Intelli\u00ad gence Committee. He said bin Laden's organization is devel\u00ad oping surrogates to carry out attacks \"to avoid detection, blame and retaliation .\" Bin Laden is wanted by the FBI in connection with the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tan\u00ad zania, which killed 224 peo\u00ad ple, and he is suspected of having a hand in last year's terrorist attack on the USS Cole in Yemen that killed 17 American sailors and nearly sank the $1 billion ship. Tenet also addressed other global threats, including: 6 Middle East peace process, and prospects for positive political change in Iran are fading. Iraq: \"We are likely to see greater assertiveness\" by President Saddam Hussein over the next year, Tenet said, as the Iraqi leader attempts to wriggle free of the U.N. eco\u00ad nomic sanctions and finance the rebuilding of his military. -India and Pakistan : Rela\u00ad tions between the South Asia rivals are volatile, \"making the risk of war between the two nuclear-armed adver\u00ad saries unacceptably high.\" Tenet said there is a \"good prospect\" of another round of nuclear tests by India and Pakistan , and following India's test of an Agni medi\u00ad um-range missile last month, \"Pakistan may respond in kind.\" Russia: Its future under President Vladimir Putin looks dim. \"There can be little doubt that President Putin wants to restore some aspects of the Soviet past,\" he said, including its status as a world power. One of his goals is to improve ties with China and other regional partners to check U.S. influence. North Korea: After nearly 10 years of decline in capabili\u00b7 ty, the North Korean military has stabilized. It also is expanding its short-and medium-range missile arse\u00b7 nal, \"putting our allies at greater risk.\" u 'i ::s E Q c: ~ \" E ~ 0 ~ Witness says he warned U.S. of bombings Prosecutors have portrayed the 1998 blasts at the U.S. Embassies as part of a worldwide plot by bin Laden. By Tom Hlp Associated Press NEW YORK-A former aide to Osama bin Laden testified Wednesday that two years before the deadly 1998 bomb\u00b7 ings ofU.S. Embassies in Africa, he warned American officials that terrorists might strike. JamalAhmedAl-Fadl , testify\u00ad ing at the trial of four men charged in the twin bombings, said he told U.S. officials that he had heard talk that bin Laden's terrorist group would \"make bombs against your embassies.\" He did not name specific tar\u00ad gets. In fact, Al-Fadl said he warned U.S. officials that attacks were possible within the United States, against U.S. military forces overseas and at American embassies. Prosecutors have portrayed the 1998 blasts at U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dares Salaam, Thnzania, as part of a worldwide plot by bin Laden.

Al-Fadl, in his second day on the witness stand, said he d id\u00ad ed to alert U.S. officials after he was kicked out of bin Laden'a organization for stealing.

India mourns loss of lives following earthquake \u00b7 Hindu priests chant for those killed in India's devastating quake. By Donna Bryson Associated Press BHUJ, India -At an altar fashioned from shipping crates, Hindu priests prayed Wednes\u00ad day for victims of India's earth\u00ad quake, chanting Sanskrit vers\u00ad es and name after name into the dusty air to remember those killed by the nation's worst quake in 50 years. The 12th day after death has special significance for Hindus and is nonnally observed with prayers. But Wednesday's cere-many was especially poignant as the confirmed death toll from the Jan. 26 quake reached 17,000. That number could go as high as 30,000 before the count\u00ad ing is over, said Haren Pandya, Gujarat state home minister. U.N. disaster management officials said Tuesday they believed up to 1 million people were left homeless by the 7.7- magnitude quake. The prayer organizers, fol-. lowers of the Gujarati holy man Swami Narayan, used newspaper ads to encourage residents to phone in the names of the dead so they could be read at the day-long service. Since many are not sure when thP.ir relatives died -or hav not managed to recover a body for cremation -the priuta decided to hold the service Wednesday for all the d d, aaid Brahmaviharidutt, a Hindu priest who uses only one name. The prayers will end the tra\u00ad ditional mourning period and help survivors move on with recovery efforts, Brahmavi\u00ad haridutt said.

Sure, in your mind you're thinking and hoping she's beautiful, but you never really know until you show up on her doorstep. In recruiting, you never really know how good these high school kids are until they suit up for a game. Sure, these 22 recruits could all tum out to be Janet Renos, but that isn't really the story here. The story is that coaches from a 3-9 team talked kids out of going to Miami and Wisconsin and into coming to Iowa to play for a team that has spent the last three years in the bot\u00b7 tom half of the Big Ten. Not only did Iowa coaches have the handicap of telling recruits their team has won only four games in two years, they also had to deal with their cross-state rival having its best football season in school history. So what does Iowa do? It lands eight in\u00b7 state recruits, some ranked nationally, to Iowa State's three, whom weren't ranked nationally.

Four times during the game Iowa had a nine\u00b7point lead, but the Hawkeyes could not deliver a knockout punch to the pesky Buckeyes . In another time, in anoth\u00ad er place, Recker could have mowed down a three-pointer that woutd have given Iowa a double-digit lead and deflated Ohio State. But Recker, out with a fractured kneecap, could only watch his under\u00ad studies try to fend off charge after Ohio State charge.

By Jill Litke Associated Press Mark Chmura will almost certainly be back at work in the NFL next fall, a reminder to Vince McMahon that just because one of his players has \"He Hate Me\" embroidered on the back ofhisjersey, it doesn't make it so. . The real lesson of Saturday night wasn't the boffo TV rat\u00ad ings for the XFL openers; it was that McMahon can invent all the storylines he wants, but he'll never top real life. The best villains are still made, not made up. About the same time his shock-and\u00ad schlock review made its debut on NBC, a jury in Waukesha, Wis., cleared the way for Chmura's return to pro football by acquitting him on charges of sexually assaulting a 17-year\u00ad old girl who used to baby-sit his two sons. The verdict wasn't 48 hours old before a half-dozen NFL teams contacted Chmura about his availability for next season. Coincidentally, that's almost tbe same number of teams headed up by coaches who worked on the Packers' staff d~ring Chmura's playing days in Green Bay. \u00b7 \"There have been several inquiries, and we are confident Mark will be playing some\u00ad where next season,\" said his agent, Eric Metz. Chmura is offlimits until NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabu,e completes an investigation, which is more likely to result in a fine than a suspension. Assum\u00ad ing that hurdle is cleared, Chmu\u00ad ra won't need any clever slogans stitched on his jersey to draw boos around the league. Like Super Bowl star Ray Lewis, his name will be enough. So how is McMahon going to compete with that? The answer is he won't -not next week, not next season, not ever. Now we know why Tagliabue simply yawned when asked about the XFL heading into the weekend. The rival league combines McMahon's entrepre\u00ad neurial genius and NBC sports boss Dick Ebersol's strong sig\u00b7 nal and deep pockets, but it doesn't scare Tagliabue any more than the uGolden Girls,\" which once occupied the same time slot on Saturday nights. uweu, we don't make much of it, because frankly we've spent so much time focused on our own issues and challenge11 that we have really not been able to focus on the XF L,\" Tagliabue said. \"In terms of competition,\" he added. \"I don't know.\" The commish may be skinny and wear glasses, but he knows more about hurting guys than all the washed-up ex-football play\u00ad ers who found work in McMa\u00ad hon's full-time phony-baloney enterprise , the WWF. Maybe that's because Tagliabue knows what happened to every other league that tried to live off the NFL. The most recent was the United States Football League. It boasted real players such as Doug Flu tie, Steve Young, Her\u00ad schel Walker and Jim Kelly, and much like the XFL, sought to capitalize on the nonstop cravings of football fans by scheduling an 18-week season soon after the Super Bowl. The USFL opened to much hoopla on ABC in March 1983, drawing a 14.2 rating and an average crowd of 39,170. Ten weeks into the season, like the spring thaw, more than two\u00ad thirds of the audience melted away. Five weeks after that, the TV ratings skidded to 3.3. Three years later, the USFL disappeared altogether . The NFL's response was to cherry-pick the talent and begin experimenting with instant replay, the only innovation pio\u00ad neered by the USFL still in use today. For all their tinkering with the sights, sounds and rules of the game, McMahon and Ebersol will be lucky to leave even that meager legacy behind. When one ofTagliabue 's lieu\u00ad tenants was asked Tuesday whether the XFL's openini box-office numbers caught the people in his office by urpns , w he replied, \"We'll leave the Z commentary to others.\" He ~ answered the next question -~ z NA Trldltlon at Tnt Un'Yitllty Of whether the NFL might steal -) some of the in-your-face pro\u00ad duction tricks the XFL u ed to great advantage -with a question of his own. w :i ~ I u NOW OFFERING FREE DELIVERY OF THE ENTIRE MENU!! \"What was one oflhc sloganR they used most in theu ad blitz?~ he asked without wait\u00ad ing for an an wer. \"It was, 'We're bringing NFL Film to life.'

ByPI Fay Associated Press SALT LAKE CITY -While Olympic organizers raise a toast and fling confetti for their one-year countdown 'Thursday, the two men who led the bid for the games will ask a federal court to dismiss charges in the Olympic bribery scandal. It's only the latest twist in the saga of the 2002 Winter Games. The most important court date since the arraignment last August of Tom Welch and Dave Johnson collides with the carefully managed Olympic celebration in this city that can't seem to e cape from the cloud of corruption. \"Talk about guys who never get a break,\" longtime Olympic critic and community activist Stephen Pace said. \"Here you've got the federal court stepping all over the one-year launch.\" Welch was no happier to learn of the coincidence than Mitt Romney , the current president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. \"Mitt was upset that our hearing was on his day,\" Welch said. \"How does he think we feel about it?\" Even Barbara Day Lock\u00ad hart, who heads the Olympic ethics board that cracked the bid scandal with a hefty report, wishes the scandal \"would just go away. I think we had enough of it. We beat up on them enough. Let's go on.\" That's not likely. Welch, who beaded the bid, and Johnson, his deputy, long ago rejected a plea bargain to a single tax felony and main\u00b7 tain they did nothing crimi\u00ad nally wrong by Osing wads of cash to land the Winter Games. Justice Department attor\u00ad neys Richard Wiedis and John Scott are determined to prove their 15-count indictment against Welch and Johnson for fraud, conspiracy and bribery. The once-lauded bid leaders are accused of plying Interna\u00ad tional Olympic Committee delegates with $1 million in cash, travel, scholarships and extravagant gifts, including a golden retriever, and not telling their board of trustees about it.

Associated Press MINNEAPOLIS -Once again, Robert Smith has elud\u00ad ed his pursuers. The agent for the 28-year-old running back confirmed Wednesday tha't Smith is retir\u00ad ing after eight seasons with the Minnesota Vikings. He is leaving the NFL at the top of his game, much like a 31-year\u00ad old Barry Sanders before the 1999 season, and at the height of his earning power as an unrestricted free agent. Smith, who announced his decision in a brief statement Tuesday to The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer, let his reasons for leaving remain a mystery. In the statement, Smith thanked his family and friends, fans and the Vikings organization. \"I \u00b7also wanted to thank my teammates and coaches for believing in me throughout my career,\" he said. The retirement leaves a large hole in the Vikings' offense. \"Robert has always been a guy that the National Football League has been able to count on as a shining \u00b7example of quality character off the field and 100 percent effort on the field,\" coach Dennis Green said in a statement. \"Robert's decision to retire, as everyone knows, comes off his best season ever as a run\u00ad ning back for the Minnesota Vikings. He leaves the game on top and is looking forward to his next challenge.\" Smith's agent, Neil Corn\u00ad rich, dismissed the idea that the often-injured back, who recently underwent a third knee operation, was tired of the pounding. \"He could easily play five . - Jim Mona/Associated Press Minnesota running back Robert Smith races 33-yards for a first quarter touchdown as Arizona Cardinal's cornerback Aeneas Williams pursues during a game on Nov. 12. more years without jeopardiz\u00ad ing his health,\" Cornrich said. \"He just decided to go in anoth\u00ad er direction at this point.\" That direction is uncertain, although Smith has said he might consider a career as a medical researcher. He purf!ued a history degree with a strong emphasis on science at Ohio State and is interested in a vari\u00ad ety of topics such as calculus, molecular genetics and classical music. Earlier this season, he said he thought he would be in medical school by now. \"I enjoy football more than [ thought I would,\" Smith told the Saint Paul Pioneer Press.\"' hon\u00ad estly didn't think I would play as long as I have. But once you're out there and enjoying it, it's completely different.\" Smith, the Vikings' first\u00ad round pick in 1993, led the NFC in rushing last season with 1,521 yards in his first complete 16-game season. He ' broke the organization 's career rushing record held by Chuck Foreman, with 6,818 yards. He rushed for 32 touchdowns and averaged 4.8 yards per carry during his career despite bat\u00ad tling a number of injuries and health problems, such as injuries to both lmees and ankles and a serious case of chicken pox. Along with Cincinnati's Corey Dillon, he was consid\u00ad ered the NFL's most desired free-agent running back and was expected to sign a contract that would have exceeded his last five-year, $25 million deal. Cornrich said he had been optimistic that Smith, who had a good relationship with Green, would re-sign with the Vikings despite the organization's salary cap limitations and the lure of the open market. Cornrich said Smith wasn't concerned about walking away from a big free\u00ad agent payday. \"He would've had unlimited financial opportunities,\" said. \"But this was not a financial decision.\" Smith was deeply disap\u00ad pointed, however, by the Vikings' 41-0 loss to the New York Giants in the NFC cham\u00ad pionship game and by the final two months of his season, in which he rushed for only 248 yards in five games. He was selected to the Pro Bowl but did not play because of knee surgery.' The VIkings had made re-sign\u00ad ing Smith a top priority, though they are expected to have to cut about $20 million to meet the 2001 salary cap limit. Smith's backup, Moe Williams, rushed for only 67 yards last season. The Vikings could use the money they had planned to spend on Smith on another top free-agent back such as Dillon or the 49ers' Charlie Garner. Dillon rushed for 1,453 yards last season, and Garner rushed for 1,142. Yanks team up with \u00b7Manchester U The most powerful baseball team and the most powerful soccer team join forces. By Ronald Blum Associated Press NEW YORK -The top two sports teams in the world want more wins and more money. So to get them, the Yanks are linking up with a bunch of Brits. It's as American as hot dogs -and prawn sandwiches? The New York Yankees, the franchise of Ruth, Gehrig and DiMaggio, forged an alliance Wednesday with Manchester United, the most storied club in European soccer. While the teams, the richest in basebal1 and soccer, don't yet know what their partner\u00ad ship will turn into, they think working together with spon\u00ad sors, selling each other's licensed goods and promoting Manchester United's 2003 tour of North America is a start. If YankeeNets LLC, the base\u00ad ball team's parent company, forms its own TV network, it will IOWA STATE FOOTBALL have ready programming in Manchester United, which in August regains the right to tele\u00ad vise its games on tape delay. And for now, it links Spice Boy David Beckham -the Manchester United star whose son is named Brooklyn -with Derek Jeter, Roger Clemens and Bernie Williams in a mar\u00ad riage fueled by Yankee dollars. \"We don't want to for one moment think that Manches\u00ad ter United is going to produce baseball teams. We don't expect the New York Yankees to produce soccer teams,\" said Manchester United director Sir Bobby Charlton, one of the club's greatest players. ''We are getting together in a business way so that we can maintain the type of standards that our club has got used to and our fans have got used to,\" he said. ''We don't sell our soul, we're not in the process of sell\u00ad ing our soul to another sport.\" Manchester United, worth about $900 million, has domi\u00ad nated English soccer recently, winning six of the last eight Premier League titles. The Yankees, valued at about $600 million, are North America's . closest equivalent, winning four of the last five World Series and 26 overall. YankeeNets owns the Yan\u00ad kees, the Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils and the NBA's New Jersey Nets. It also has a similar marketing alliance with the NFL's New York Giants, losers of last month's Super Bowl. But on a global scale, Man\u00ad chester United is much larger. \"We believe that the sport of soccer -football, as it is called on the other side of the ocean -is ready to really burst into the right way,\" YankeeNets chairman Harvey Schiller said, \"and I think that the things that we have planned with Manchester United in the days, months, years ahead will help to grow the sport in this country in the way thai it prob\u00ad ably should grow.\" Manchester United was crit\u00ad icized by some fans for putting finance ahead of sport. \"Football should not be run solely to suit the needs of for\u00ad eign broadcasters and overseas marketing juggernauts,\" said Oliver Houston, head.of a Man\u00ad chester United shareholders group .

If this keeps up, Iowa State is on its way to becoming Texas North. \"It's a real important area to us,\" said McCarney , who had five coaches working the Lone Star State. \"We feel like once we get outside the state oflowa, our sec\u00ad ond home is the state of'Thxas. \"'wouldn't be surprised to see us hitting double figures every year in Texas. The programs are great. The talent is everywhere .\" There also was plenty of talent in Iowa, McCarney admitted, but the Cyclones signed only three players from the state. He said he\u00b7was disappointed about\u00b7 not getting more. \"I feel super. about the three kids we've got coming,\" said McCarney , whose team is com\u00ad ing off\u00b7 a 9-3 season that included a victory in the lnsight.com Bowl. \"But we've got to do a better job in-state. It was a good year. There were good kids in the state. \"Yet this is still a program that's just full of Iowa kids. Of the 104 kids on the spring ros\u00ad ter, 50 are from the state of Iowa. But we want our batting average to be better than it was this year in-state.\" ' The Iowans who signed with the Cyclones were punter Troy Blankenship of Cedar Rapids Kennedy, running back T.J. Klith of Cedar Rapids Prairie and Fort Dodge's Nik Moser, who could play quarterback, wide receiver or defensive back, and was a state sprint champi\u00ad on in track last spring. McCarney 's best prospect is not from Texas or Iowa. He's Seneca Wallace, a quarterback from Sacramento, Calif., City College who already has enrolled but wouldn't be at Iowa State if he had J;l.Ot been short an English class coming out of high school. Wallace was set to start at cor\u00ad nerback as a true freshman at Oregon State in the 1998 season opener when be was told he had not been approved by the NCAA Clearinghouse. He eventually returned home to Sacramento and enrolled at the local junior college in January ot'l999. While there, he threw for 1,398 yards as a freshman and 3,675 yards and 22 touchdowns last fall. He also ran for 550 yards in just 49 attempts, an average of 11.2 yards a carry. \"We had a lot of big plays,\" Wallace said. \"A lot of the offense was geared around me. We had a lot of running plays for the quarterback .\" Phlllles beat Lea In arbitration case (AP) -Travis Lee didn't do any better at arbitration 1han he did a1 the pla1e last season. Philadelphia won its case agaihst the first baseman Tuesday in the first salary arbitration case of the year. Detroit right-hander Chris Holt and Kansas City catcher Greg~ Zaun were next up, arguing their cases before panels. Lee, who hit .2351ast season with nine homers and 54 RBis in 404 at\u00ad bats, will ge1 $800,000 rather than his request for $1.6 million. BlATT SPOITS II/IF I Arbitrators Jack Clarke, Matthew Finken and Jerome Ross heard the case Monday In Phoenix. Lee, who made $500,000 last season, was the flrs1 Philadelphia player to go to a hearing since pitcher Willie Banks. who lost in 1996. The Phlllles are 7-0 In deci\u00b7 sions since arbitra1ion began In 1974. \"I'm glad It's been resolved,\" Phillies general manager Ed Wade said. \"I had a chance to talk to Travis both before and after Monday's hearing and we both agreed tha1 once 1he decision is handed down.

Laud rda Daily Iowan-Iowa City, Iowa-Thursday, February 8, 2001 -58 .. Iowa hits D-line and receving corps hard RECRUITING Continued from Page lB regarded as . the top prep offensive lineman in the nation. At 6-foot-7 and 304 pounds, he has the size to con\u00b7 tend for a spot immediately . AJJ a consensus high school All-American he also has the talent to be a major contribu\u00ad tor. Ferentz also addressed the need to strengthen a second\u00ad ary that allowed nearly 3,000 passing yards last year. Six of the incoming 22 players are listed as defensive backs, including Jermire Roberts, a 6-foot-2 second-team junior college All-American , and 6- foot-5 West Des Moines native Mike Follett. He waa rated as the 73rd best safety in the nation by rivals. With the loss of seniors Kevin Kasper and Ryan Barton, Ferentz tagged the wide receiv\u00ad er position as his final need. In addition to the loss of Kasper's sure hands and 84 yards a game, Kahlil Hill and Chris Oliver will be seniors, leaving the Hawkeyes with relatively no experience following the upcoming season. Four wideouts, three prep athletes and one junior-col\u00ad lege transfer will look to be thrown into the mix. Finally, the ongoing dual between senior Kyle McCann and sophomore Jon Beutjer for the starting quarterback spot was dealt an interesting twist with the signing of jun\u00ad ior college transfer Brad Banks out of Hinds Community College in Mississippi . Banks led his team to an 11- loverall record as a sopho-more, winning the state junior college title last season. The 6-foot-1, 180-pound quarter\u00ad back threw for over 2,000 yards and 16 touchdowns and rushed for over 500 yards, while scoring 13 times on the ground. \"The first issue was if we wanted to recruit a junior col\u00ad lege quarterback, \" Ferentz said. \"We evaluated a bunch of guys on film and be was the best guy that we had on tape. The next step was how that was going to affect the mix. First and foremost we are impressed with his throwing. We wanted a quarterback that can throw. He's going to be playing catch-up but I do think he has a chance to get in the competition with the other guys.\" Other than the junior col\u00ad lege players, Ferentz said hopefully no members of his incoming class will have to start, but he hasn't ruled anyr thing out. \u00b7 \"I don't think things could have fallen a lot better,\" Ferentz said. \"There weren't a lot of things we would have changed and we're very happy about that. Again, keeping in mind the real work is ahead of these guys, but we're anxious to get them on campus and start working with them.\" Ferentz added that his recruiting class is complete and his staff will take a little time off before resuming prac\u00ad tice with the current Iowa players on campus. Spring practice begins on March 27, with the annual Spring Game scheduled for April 14 at Kinnick Stadium. Dl reporter Melinda Mawdsley can be reached at melinda\u00b7mawdsley@uiowa .edu Iowa still has lots of work to do on field SCHNITKER Contmued from Page lB turn out to be All-Americans; the real victory is that Iowa succeeded in pulling kids away from major programs . According to Ferentz, that is what gives these coaches and this program national validi\u00b7 ty. Kirk Ferentz and his staff de erve major kudos for pulling this class, which just about every recruiting ana\u00b7 lyal Calls one of the best 25 to 30 in the country. After all, the major reason most of tb c players chose Iowa was because of the coaches, not because Iowa was winning ball games and conference titles. Why diu Blake Larson choo Iowa over Miami and Michigan State? According to the lineman from Atlantic, Iowa, Ferentz was a main rea\u00ad son. Why did Ben Cronin choose Iowa over Wisconsin? It prob\u00ad ably bad a lot to do with the hand-written letters Ferentz sent to the Ames lineman. Like most Iowa players, they grew up with Rose Bowls and Chuck Longs -they all watched Iowa win as kids. The fact that they turned down schools with current winning traditions says a lot about Ferentz and the direc\u00ad tion of this program. It seems that Ferentz has quietly, and a little slowly, been patching things back together for the Hawkeyes . It was just this fall -after fans endured a loss to Wes~m Michigan and saw Oklahoma, coached by a guy that was \"supposed\" to be here, rise to No. 1 -that people wanted Ferentz's head. Now, Ferentz is showing all those Hawkeye \"faithtul\" that good things can come to those who wait. The fact that Iowa won three conference games in 2000 and went on to put together one of the best recruiting classes in recent Iowa history proves this. \u00b7 But, before I get too far ahead of myself, good things still have to come. Iowa did win only three games this year. And sure, this class looks awesome on paper, but football games are won on the field, not on letters of intent. This class will be good though. Ferentz worked won\u00ad ders with the players from last year's recruiting class, which couldn't touch this one as far as speed and size go. Guys like Benny Sapp, Demond Sanders and Derrick Pickens stepped in and start\u00ad ed last year. If I remember correctly, none of those recruits were considered blue chippers, but they certainly showed they could play ball. What Ferentz and his staff can do with. guys who are sup\u00b7 posedly better recruits than last year's can only be good. Landing a top 25 recruiting class certainly doesn't guar\u00ad antee a Big Ten title, but it certainly doesn't hurt either. From Ferentz on down, this coaching staff deserves a round of applause-its inch\u00b7 ing closer and closer to put\u00ad ting Iowa football back on the map. Dl Sports Editor Jeremy Schnitker can be reached at: jschnitk@blue.V(eeg.ulowa.edu Recker's intangibles missed ANALYSIS Continued from Page lB out of the lineup. It did not happen. . Worley fouled out, Henderson fouled out. Ryan Hogan had the ball in his hands for a last-second three\u00ad pointer and missed a jumper from inside the three-point line. Time after time, Iowa drove the lane and OSU's Ken Johnson blocked the shot or caused a ruckus beneath the basket. Iowa's Dean Oliver did his best to pick up the slack like he has time and again during his Hawkeye career. Oliver deliv\u00ad ered key baskets that put the Hawkeyes in position to win, but he alone could not compen\u00ad sate for Recker's absence. Evans could not get open looks in the last five minutes and Iowa did not take advan\u00b7 tage of Ohio State's foul trou\u00ad ble, allowing the Buckeyes to get back in the game. Steve Alford said after the game his Hawkeyes missed the int;mgibles Recker brings to the table. He was right. Leadership on the court, toughness and gamesma.nship were missed nearly as much as a big-three pointer. But injuries are a part of college basketball , and Iowa proved what implicitly lament\u00b7 ing Recker's loss can do. While it is douptful the Hawkeyes outwardly worried about Recker's inability to play, it looked as though Iowa was dis\u00b7 combobulated down the stretch. Dl Sports Editor Mike Kelly can be reached at mwkellyCblue .weeg.ulowa.edu Alford didn't push me Evan. contributed a double\u00ad double once again for Iowa, pulling down p rebounds and adding 14 points. Still, Alford \u00b7 d it was not enough to over\u00ad come being down as a team both mentally and physically. Your go-to guy (Recker) is rone,\" Alford said. \"lt may take thi team a while to figure out who to go to now.\"Luke Recker may have been playing on a rioUJiy injured knee longer than was originally thought. peaking ror the first time ain Iowa announced he would be out indefinite ly on Feb. 2, Recker said he knew omething wu seriously wro111 wilh his knee after the Mia ouri game on Dec. 18, 2000.

At times, how\u00ad ever, it seemed Alford was call\u00ad ing Recker out publicly, saying he should be tougher when deal\u00ad ing with the injury.

It was the first fonnal meeting between the two women, and Frazier initially seemed intent on making the occasion friendly.

Even though Laila was intent on avoiding the day -her cor\u00ad ner has always claimed that Frazier is in it just for the money, not the sport -the months of taunting by Jacqui But as Frazier, who has won all six of her pro fight:.c! by knock\u00b7 out, neared the end of her talk, she abruptly changed the mood of the moment, slamming her right fist through the middle of the cake and grinning widely as she swung. \"I'm going to eat that body up,\" said Frazier, 39, who has lost 46 pounds in the past 18 months and expecl:.<! to weigh around 168 for their middleweight bout. \"She's not going to be able to walk the same.\" At 23, Laila is tall (5-foot\u00b7 10), slender and muscular like her father was in his prime and is unbeaten in eight fights with seven knockouts . She was unfazed by Jacqui's antics, which included several flexes of her bulging biceps.

By Mark Long Associated Press MIAMI -Alonzo Mourn\u00ad ing's biggest challenge right now is trying to be patient. It's tough when he thinks about possibly needing dialy\u00ad sis or a kidney transplant. It's tough when he remembers being doubled over in pain last October during the first days of treatment for the kidney disease. And it's really tough every time he sits on the bench, watching his team\u00ad mates play without him. It's going to be the same way at the All-Star game this we~kend. Mourning, the Miami Heat center who was selected to his sixth All-Star Game, said Wednesday he is making slow but steady progress in his bat\u00ad tle with a kidney disease that ended his season. But his future remains uncertain . \"My doctors are extremely pleased with my progress,\" WIIJredo Lee/Associated Press Miami Heat \u00b7center Alonzo Mourning gestures as he speaks to the media on Feb. 7, in Miami. said Mourning, 31. \"They are surprised that I am progress\u00ad ing so rapidly, but I'm not pro\u00ad gressing as fast I want to progress. \"I want to play this year. My doctors aren't as optimistic as I am, but they have a better medical sense than l do. I will ignore how my body feels and will listen to my mind and my heart, which would be foolish at this point in my life. n Doctors first spotted the dis\u00ad ease, focal glomerulosclerosis, after Mourning returned from helping the U.S. Olympic team to the basketball gold medal in Australia . Two weeks later, in mid\u00ad October, Mourning announced that he would have to sit out the season because of the ill\u00ad ness. Since the decision, the 6- foot-10 Mourning has been taking medication to stop his kidneys from leaking proteins. Still, he might eventually require dialysis or a kidney transplant. It also could force him to give up basketball. \"I don't even want to think that far ahead,\" Mourning said. \"I know that's not going to happen. I don't know when I'm going to get back out there, but I know I will. I know I still have some basket\u00ad ball left in me.\" Mourning is in the middle of a six-month treatment program, taking as many as 11 pills a day to control his kidneys, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. He also is following a strict low\u00ad sodium diet. He hired a nutritionist and had to give up some of his favorite foods. But that does\u00ad n't even compare to having to sacrifice time on the court. \"I miss the game whole\u00ad heartedly,\" he said. \"I see the guys out there putting their heart and soul and leaving it all out there on the floor. 1 just miss that. It's difficult to digest that I have to wait on some medication to pretty much dictate whether I'm going to be back on the court.\" Mourning has good days and bad days. On good days, he has plenty of energy and feels ready to play for the Heat. But on bad days\\ he feels lethargic and sometimes wonders when, or if, he will return. The medicine is primarily responsible for his moods. He vividly remembers the early side effe'cts from the treat\u00ad ment. He was dizzy, nauseous and had severe stomach pains. \"I went through two or three weeks where it was just tor\u00b7 ture,\" he said. 1iger Woods says he's right on track \u00b7 Woods says he is not worried about success despite not winning in the last six tournaments. By Doug ferguson Associated Press SAN DIEGO -The real rea\u00ad son for what's been holding back Tiger Woods was finally revealed Wednesday . It's the hair. He dyed it blonll over the holidays and hasn't won since. That's all of three tourna\u00ad ments. \"Maybe I need t()-dye it back,\" said Woods, who might be the last person concerned that it's already February and he still doesn't have a victory in 2001. His hair color is bac.\\t to nor\u00ad mal. He looks like the same player who won three straight majors and nine out of the 20 PGA Tour events he played last year. The only difference is the record, which is tough to top. Lenny lgnelzi/Associated Press Tiger Woods blast from a bad lie in the bunker on the 16th hole dur\u00ad ing the final round of the Buitk Invitational on Feb. 13. ten that many in the last two months.\" and right at a pin that was best left alone. Woods keep his own record. \"I guess the Grand Slam doesn't count,\" he said. That was the four-man , 36-hole tournament in Hawaii the week before Thanksgiving when Woods made eagle on the 18th hole to force a playoff with Vijay Singh, then another eagle on the first extra hole to win. \"I guess the European tour doesn't count,\" said Woods, referring to his three-stroke victory in the Johnnie Walker Classic in Thailand the week after Valderrama . \"I haven't won in three tour-' naments,\" he said. \"That's not a slump, not like some of these people think it is. If I can go three tournaments and people call it a slump, then I've actu\u00ad ally played some pretty good golf.\" Woods has himself to blame for that. He raised the expectations with one of the greatest years ever in sports. Along with his nine victories and three straight majors, he never went more than three PGA Tour SPORTS BRIEF Purdue undefeated In Big Ten so far WEST LAFAYffiE. lnd (AP) - Going undefeated in the Btg Ten once was not enough for camtlle Cooper.

(AP) -Frank Williams is a sophomore, but even he knows No. 7 Illinois had better not celebrate too much. too soon. Basking in a 77-66 win over No.4 Michigan State, Williams and the lllini sit alone atop the standings In their quest to end the Spartans' three-year reign over Big Ten basket\u00ad ball. They want the crown, but Williams said they haven't earned it yet. \"It's important, but we've got a l9t \"I've gotten a lot of questions in the last two years.

We haven't been playing so well on the road.\" Indeed, all five of Illinois' losses have happened away from Assembly Hall, where a frenzied, orange-coat\u00ad ed crowd helped them overcome scary Michigan State runs to open the first and second halves on Tuesday night. Two of those early-season losses were' by one basket to teams ranked No. 1 in the country at the time, Duke and Arizona. The other three defeats wer'e to teams that, at least on paper, the lllini should have beat\u00b7 en. \"In our minds, we felt all along we should be winning all those games,\" Robert Archibald said. \"We know what were capable of. It's good from a con\u00ad fidence standpoint and to see the things we need to do to win games.\" The most bothersome loss so far is Jan. 31's breakdown at Penn State. The lllini got up 13 late in the first half and did not finish off the Nittany Lions. Penn State's shooters got hot and suddenly Illinois was battling just to get into overtime, Thursday only three times finished lower than fifth. ' \"It's not like I'm missing cuts, Woods said. \"I'm right there. My worst finish has been 13th. That's terrible, isn't it?\" where they lost. Illinois coach Bill Self is exploiting that loss to prevent players from getting too hyper about the win over Michigan State. \"That's going to be the hardest thing for Bill now,\" luo said after the game. Had Illinois won at Penn State. Self reminds his players they would now have a virtually insurmountable two-game lead over Michigan State in the Big Ten race.

A major studio film such as What Women Want has approxi\u00ad mately 2,500 prints in circulation when il is released, so Central tate can easily book it in such maller markets as Iowa City and De\u00b7 Moines. In contrast, when Crouching Tiger was first released, on Dec. 15, only 20 prints were made available by its di tributor, Sony Pictures Cia ics. By the end of January, that total had nsen to approximate\u00ad ly 800, till not enough for Central tate to acquire a print.

The Daily Iowan At 8:15 a.m. on Aug. 6, 1945, Enola Gay, a U.S. B-29 bomber, dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima . It has been 60 years since the bombing hit a war-devas\u00ad tated Japan, but the theater com\u00b7 pany Dairakudakan will come to Hancher Auditorium Saturday to reflect on this historical event through dance. years followng the war and first performed in 1959, when Japanese artists wished to express the hor- ror engendered by the nuclear bomb, said Don Boros, a UI visit\u00ad ing assistant professor in theater. \"When Japanese artists such as Yukio Mishima and Tatsumi Hijikata realized that the country wanted to dismiss this \u00b7calamity it had experienced, they said, 'We can't forget about it. We must not only show what happened, we must never let people forget what happened,'\" Boros said.

Paul Simon was quick to get back to doing what he loves most: making music. Over the next 15 years, he was able to produce eight quality studio albums.
