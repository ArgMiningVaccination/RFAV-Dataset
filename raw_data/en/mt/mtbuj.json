DeNood Thornton \"I came to the CBMW with balance and mobility issues made more difficult by the onset of multiple cancers involving surgeries, radiation and chemotherapies. I was beaten down physically, with pain, fatigue, weakness and feeling spiritually useless and hopeless. I was encouraged to come here. I received and continue to receive not only physical care but emotional and spiritual support as well.\" \u2014 J. D'Angelo CBMW client \"Coming to the Center for Balance, Mobility & Wellness has made a difference in my life. Five years ago, I was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease and recently this past year with Cervical Spinal Stenosis. Marie Lucey the physical therapist/clinical director is great! Her knowledge of Parkinson's Disease and her support has helped me tremendously. I left for about a year but I decided to come back due to my increasing health problems and I'm so glad I did. The last six months of working with Wellness & Fitness Director, Andrew Walker, have been unbelievable. I feel more motivated and challenged and I'm getting stronger. I never thought I could do this and my family and friends have noticed the change. Heather Lewis, the physical therapist, has also helped me understand cervical spinal stenosis and has made me feel more comfortable. The staff at the CBMW is great. \u2014 M. Rosa, CBMW client \"I just want to thank you [Marie] and Heather for helping me once again with my Vertigo. I was struggling to walk in a straight line and was afraid to put my head back. I am a repeat client of the Center of Balance (I call it the Wobbly center). After performing the Epley Maneuver and a few other exercises, Heather helped me get back on my feet and walking a straight line, The best call I made that morning was calling you guys..\" \u2014 Gatey, CBMW client "}
