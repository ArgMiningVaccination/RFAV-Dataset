This work supports The Healthy Brain Initiative: The Public Health Road Map for State and National Partnerships (Road Map) in terms of developing a competent workforce. The curriculum consists of four modules: Module 1: Alzheimer's Disease - A Public Health Crisis frames Alzheimer's and other dementias as a public health epidemic with a large and rapidly growing burden that bears significant impact on the nation. Module 2: Alzheimer's and Other Dementias - The Basics describes Alzheimer's and other dementias including symptoms, stages, risk factors, diagnosis, and management. Module 3: Alzheimer's Disease - What is the Role of Public Health? discusses three tools of public health that may play a significant role in mitigating the Alzheimer's disease epidemic: surveillance/monitoring, primary prevention, and early detection and diagnosis. Module 4: Dementia Capable Systems and Dementia Friendly Communities addresses the public health response to the Alzheimer's disease epidemic on a state and community level. The module describes the concept of a \"dementia capable\" system and explores how public health may support the development of such systems through public health research and translation, support services and programs, workforce training, and the creation of dementia-friendly communities. The following materials are provided for each module: Faculty Guide , including: o Learning objectives o Competencies o Discussion questions o Learning activities o Slide guide with talking points o Sample test questions o Case studies o Video Resources 4o References PowerPoint slides HOW TO USE THE MATERIALS The four modules were designed f or use either as a set or as stand-alone modules. Users are free to make changes to the materials to fit their needs, including: adding, modifying or removing content, graphics, talking points, discussion questions or learning activities. The Faculty Guide for each module includes a slide guide that contains the information as presented in the slide, talking points, space for presenter notes, and references. The talking points included in the Faculty Guide should not be read word for word; each presenter should review the materials before delivering the material to ensure familiarity and deliver the information in his/her own style. Delivery time will generally be 60-90 minutes per module, depending on class engagement, presenter style, and the addition or elimination of any content, discussion questions, or learning activities. Discussion questions are included in the slide deck of each module. These may be modified or removed at the discretion of the presenter. Questions may also be used for other activities such as small group discussion or individual writing assignments. Video resources, a list of articles and case studies are also included to help in learning more about the topics presented in each module. Test questions are provided with each module as an additional resource for faculty. All materials are 508 compliant. ( Note: if changes are made to the curriculum, it is recommended that changes continue to follow 508 compliance guidelines.

Developed as part of a cooperative agreement with CDC's Healthy Aging Program, and in partnership with Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health, this curriculum addresses cognitive health, cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease and is for use by undergraduate faculty in schools and programs of public health. Module 1 : Alzheimer's Disease - A Public Health Crisis . This module frames Alzheimer's and dementia as a public health epidemic with a large and rapidly growing burden that bears significant impact on the nation. The impact of Alzheimer's disease is felt at a national, state, and local level - as well as on a family and personal level - through financial burdens, resource needs, and professional requirements. Module 1 focuses primarily on the United States as it explores the current and projected scope of the epidemic, the financial burden on federal and state governments as well as individuals, and the care burden on caregivers and the health care system. Health disparities are highlighted , as rates of Alzheimer's disease ar e substantially higher for African-Americans and Hispanics. Module 1 covers the following topics : Scope of the epidemic Financial burden Care burden Public health approach LEARNING OBJECTIVES At the end of Module 1 : Alzheimer's Disease - A Public Health Crisis , students will be able to: Provide a general description of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Explain the current and projected scope of the Alzheimer's disease epidemic. Discuss the cost burden of Alzheimer's disease for federal/state governments and individuals/caregivers. Describe the care burden of Alzheimer's disease , including caregivers and the health care system. 11 Identify health disparities related to Alzheimer's and dementia . Explain why public health must play a role in addressing the Alzheim er's disease epidemic.

(NCHEC): 7.1.1 Identify current and emerging issues that may influence health and health education. 17SLIDE 4: Alzheimer's - Public Health Crisis1 Historically viewed as aging or medical issue Impact at national, state, and local levels Multi-faceted approach needed TALKING POINTS: For many years after its discovery in 1906, Alzheimer's disease was primarily viewed through the lenses of medical care and aging. There are valid reasons for this. Medical care is an essential component of identifying and treating individuals with Alzhei mer's disease, which primarily affects older populations . Aging services such as nursing homes and programs aimed at assisting seniors are often a vital source of support for people with Alzheimer's and other dementias. Yet, Alzheimer's disease affects mo re than ju st the individual and his or her medical and support team. The impact of Alzheimer's disease is felt at national , state , and local levels - as well as on a family and personal level - through financial burdens , resource needs , and professional requirements . It is a growing epidemic that has profound social and economic implications, especially given the current trends of an aging population. As more is learned about Alzheimer's disease and its impact, it becomes clear that a multi-faceted response by health care sector, government, public health and within communities is vitally important to address the growing crisis within the U.S. and throughout the world. 1 Alzheimer's Association and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Dementia is a general term for a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life. Dementia is not a specific disease. It is an overall term that describes a wide range of symptoms associated with a decline in memory or other thinking skills. Many dementias are progressive, meaning that symptoms start out slowly and gradually get worse. In the most severe stages of dementia, a person must depend on others for basic activities of daily life. 2 Alzheimer's Association. What is Dementia?

Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia. It accounts for an estimated 60% to 80% of cases. Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible , progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills , and eventually the ability to carry out basic functions . There are currently no known ways to prevent , cure , or slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. *Note: The image on the slide shows a healthy brain (left side) as com pared to a severe Alzheimer's brain (right side). The Alzheimer's brain is significantly smaller than the healthy brain. \"What is 8, 2015 from website: http://www.alz.org/what- is-dementia.asp#causes 5 National Institute on Aging.

There are many reasons for this. First, the burden is large - and it is growing. Today, over 5 million adults in the U.S. are living with Alzheimer's disease , including an estimated 200,000 under the age of 65. One in nine adults age 65 and older (11%) currently has Alzheimer's disease ; approximately one in three (32% ) people age 85 and older has the disease. Women make up almost 2/3 of seniors living with Alzheimer's disease in the U.S . 6 Alzheimer's Associat ion. 2016 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures .

In the U.S., African-Americans and Hispanics have higher rates of Alzheimer's and other dementias than people of other races and ethnicities. In the United States, older African-Americans are about two times more likely than older whites to have Alzheimer's and other dementias. Older Hispanics are about one and one-half times more likely than older whites to have these conditions. Large proportional increases are also expected in both of these populations in the U.S., which will contribute significantly to the growth of the epidemic. Limited data exists about the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in other racial and ethnic groups, including Asian Americans and American Indians. 7 Alzheimer's Association.

Deaths from Alzheimer's disease increased 71% from 2000 to 2013, while deaths from other major diseases (including stroke, breast and prostate cancer, and HIV/AIDS) decreased. Alzheimer's disease is th e only cause of death among the top 10 in America that cannot currently be prevented, cured, or even slowed. 8 Alzheimer's Association. 2016 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures . 24SLIDE 11: Changes in Causes of Death (2000 -2013) (bar chart)9 HIV (-52%) Stroke (-23 %) Heart disease (-14 %) Influenza/Pneumonia (-13%) Prostate cancer (- 11%) Breast cancer (-2%) Alzheimer's disease (71%) TALKING POINTS: Compared to o ther top causes of death in the U.S., deaths from Alzheimer's have increased significantly , while deaths from others have declined . From 2000 to 2013, the percentage changes in deaths are as follows: HIV: declined by 52% Stroke: declined by by by 13% increased by 71% 9 and Figures . 25SLIDE 12: Growing Epidemic10,11 By 2030 U.S. population age 65 expected to double By 2050, 13.8 million with Alzheimer's Today, one new case every 67 seconds By 2050, every 33 seconds TALKING POINTS: The number of people living with Alzheimer's and other dementias will continue to grow each year, as the number and proportion of the U.S. population age 65 and older continues to increase rapidly. The cause of the increase can be attributed to people living longer and the large increase in the number of people over age 65 (baby boomers). By 2030, the U.S. population aged 65 and over is expected to double. By 2050, the number of Americans living with Alzheimer's disease is expected to total 13.8 million , and could be as high as 16 million . Today, someone in the U.S. develops Alzheimer's every 67 seconds . By 2050, that rate is expected to increase to one person every 33 seconds . 10 Alzheimer's Associati on. 2016 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures . 11 Alzheimer's Association. (2011).

This number is projected to nearly double every 20 years to 76 million in 2030 and 145 million in 2050. The total number of new cases of dementia each year worldwide is nearly 7.7 million, which equates to one new case every four seconds . 12 World Health Organization. (2016) Report by the Secretariat.

In the U.S. the annual costs of direct care for people with Alzheimer's disease exceed $200 billion . \"Direct care\" includes both paid health care and long-term care. It does not include caregiving (an essential part of Alzheimer's care), which will be discussed later in the module. Worldwide, the annual costs of Alzheimer's and other dementias are estimated to be over $ 818 billion . 13 Alzheimer's Association. 2016 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures . 14 Alzheimer 's Disease International.

First, we'll start by looking at the Alzheimer's disease burden on two federally-funded health care programs. What are Medicare and Medicaid? Open responses. 30SLIDE 17: Medicare & Medicaid15 Medicare: federally-funded health insurance o U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident age 65 o People under age 65 with certain disabilities or End-Stage Renal Disease Medicaid: funded by federal and state governments o Helps with medical costs for some people with limited income and resources TALKING POINTS: Alzheimer's disease imposes a significant cost on federal and state budgets through Medicare and Medicaid . Medicare is federally funded health insurance for people age 65 and older who are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents, or people under 65 with cer tain disabilities or with End-Stage Renal Disease (kidney failure that requires dialysis or a kidney transplant). Medicaid is a program funded by both federal and state governments to help with medical costs for some people with limited income and resources. Medicare does not cover the cost of long term care for assisted living, nursing homes, or in-home care such as sitters or certified nursing assistants. Medicaid will cover the cost of nursing home care for low income individuals or once an individual has little personal assets remaining and/or may require that the majority of the individual's monthly income go to cover nursing home care expenses. 15 Department of Health and Human Services. (2015) What's Medicare? What's Medicaid? Image source: & Pay 70% of health and long-term costs of Alzheimer's Nearly 1 in 5 Medicare dollars Per-person spending for those with Alzheimer's : o Medicare: 3 times higher than average o Medicaid: 19 times higher than average TALKING POINTS: These facts underscore the significant costs facing Medicare and Medicaid as a result of the Alzheimer's disease ep idemic. About 70% of the health and long-term care costs of caring for those with Alzheimer's disease are paid for by Medicare and Medicaid. In 2016, the Medicare and Medicaid government programs will spend an estimated $160 billion caring for those with Alzheimer's and other dementias - 68% of total annual costs of these conditions. Nearly one in every five Medicare dollars is spent on people with Alzheimer's and other dementias. Average per-person Medicare spending for those with Alzheimer's and other dementias is three times higher than average per-person spending across all other seniors. Medicaid payments are 19 times higher . People with Alzheimer's and other dementias have h igh out- of-pocket costs. These costs are for Medicare and other health insurance premiums and for deductibles, copayments and services not covered by Medicare, Medicaid or additional sources of support. 16 Alzheimer's Associ ation. 2016 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures . 17 Alzheimer's Association. (2015) Costs of Alzheimer's to Medicaid . Image source: clker.com 32SLIDE 19: Alzheimer's : over $1.1 trillion Medicare: $589 400% increase) Out- of-pocket (350% increase) Cumulative costs (2015 - 2050): $20.8 trillion TALKING POINTS: Just as the number of people with Alzheimer's disease is projected to dramatically increase, so will the costs associated with their care. If current conditions go unchanged, in 2050 the annual costs of treating Alzheimer's disease in the US will be over $1.1 trillion (in 2016 dollars). Annual costs to Medicare will increase over 400% to $589 billion . This would represent nearly one in three Medicare dollars. Out- of-pocket costs for individuals and families affected by Alzheimer's and other dementias will increase about 350% from $44 billion in 2015 to $198 billion in 2050. Cumulatively between now and 2050, total costs of caring for people with Alzheimer's and other dementias will be $20.8 trillion . Nearly 70% of those costs will be paid by federal and state governments. 18 Alzheimer's Association . 2016 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures . 33SLIDE 20: CARE BURDEN TALKING POINTS: The care burden associated with the Alzheimer's disease epidemic is also a significant and growing challenge. 34SLIDE 21: Care Workforce19 Caregivers (family or friends) Health care providers Paid care providers TALKING POINTS: People with Alzheimer's and other dementias are generally cared for by a network of family or friend caregivers , health care providers , and paid care providers (such as those who help with daily tasks and self-care). Most individuals with Alzheim er's disease have a primary caregiver - often a family member - who is crucial to ensuring appropriate care. The type and scope of the care needed by people with Alzheimer's disease changes throughout the course of the illness. 19 Image source: Copyright ed image; used with permission from the Alzheimer's Association 35SLIDE 22: Alzheimer's & Dementia Caregivers20 83% of the care provided to older adults come from family members, friends or other unpaid caregivers 60% of people with Alzheimer's live in home settings Over 15 million caregivers (family and friends) 18 billion hours of unpaid care annually Unpaid care valued at $2 21 billion (2015) TALKING POINTS: In the US, 83% of the care provided to older adults come from family members, friends or other unpaid caregivers. About 60% of people with Alzheimer's disease live in home settings with the vast majority of their care provided by family and friends . Currently in the U.S., it is estimated that over 15 million family and friends provide nearly 18 billion hours of unpaid care annually. In 2015, this care was valued at $221 billion.

Ask: What might be the roles and responsibilities of a caregiver for someone with Alzheimer's disease? Open responses. 37SLIDE 24: Alzheimer's & Dementia Caregivers21 Caregiving responsibilities o Help with dressing, bathing, toileting, feeding o Shopping, meal preparation, transportation o Medication management, financial management o Emotional support Requires increasing levels of care Results in complete dependence TALKING POINTS: The term care giver is used to describe a person who provides a level of care and support for another that exceeds typical responsibilities of daily life. This does not include hired help, such as home health aides which we'll discuss in a few slides. Caregiving responsibilities, especially in the moderate and severe stages of Alzheimer's disease , often include: Help with dressing, bathing, toileting, and feeding Shopping, meal preparation, transportation Medication management, financial management Providing emotional support People with Alzheimer's require increasing levels of caregiving as the disease progresses; more severe stages may require constant supervision and result in complete dependence on caregivers (paid or unpaid). 21 Alzheimer's Association. (201 6) Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures . 38SLIDE 25: Caregivers: Challenges22 Physical, psychological, social challenges o $10.2 billion additional health care costs (2015) o 60% rate emotional stress as high or very high o 40% suffer from depression TALKING POINTS: Caregivers of p eople with Alzheimer's and other dementias often experience physical , psychological , and social challenges. Several recent findings highlight these challenges: Due to the physical and emotional toll of caring for someone with Alzheimer's or other dementias, these caregivers had $10.2 billion in additional health care costs in 2015. Nearly 60% of Alzheimer's and dementia caregivers rate the emotional stress of caregiving as high or very high. About 40% of Alzheimer's and dementia caregivers suffer from depression . 22 Alzheimer's As sociation. (2016) Alzheimer's Disease Caregivers .

Among Alzheimer's and dementia caregivers who are employed full or part time: 54% said they had to go in late, leave early, or take time off because of their caregiving responsibilities 15% had to take a leave of absence 13% had to go from working full time to part time 13% had to take a less demanding job 9% had to quit work entirely either to become a caregiver or because their caregiving duties became too burdensome 8% lost job benefits 23 Alzheimer's Association . (2016) Care24,25 75% at least one year 33% five or more years Average length of time: 4.6 years May range from 4 - 20 years TALKING POINTS: Caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's an d other dementias spend much more time providing care than caregivers of individuals with other conditions. In 2014, of the unpaid Alzhe imer's and dementia caregivers: 75% had been providing care for at least a year 33% had been providing care for five or more years The average length of time caregivers in general report providing care is 4.6 years, but in the cases involving dementia, caregiving may range from 4 to 20 years . 24 Alzheimer's As sociation. (2015) Alzheimer's Disease Caregivers . for Caregiving & Caregiving in the U.S. 41SLIDE 28: Caregivers: Critical Role Health care system could not sustain costs of care Support for caregivers is public health issue TALKING POINTS: The burden on caregivers is significant; they play a critical role in supporting individuals with Alzheimer's and dementia. Without caregivers, the health care system could not sustain the costs of care for persons with Alzheimer's and other dementias. Assuring caregivers receive needed support is a public health issue .

Furthermore, many professionals already in the workforce are not adequately trained on the needs of people with Alzheimer's and other dementias. Current estimations of workforce shortages include: The U.S. will need an additional 3.5 million health care professionals by 2030 just to maintain the current ratio of health care professionals to the older population The U.S. has approximately half the number of certified geriatricians than it currently needs Less than 1% of registered nurses , physician assistants , and pharmacists identify themselves as specializing in geriatrics 26 Alzheimer's Association. 2015 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures.

These workers help with bathing , dressing , eating , and numerous other daily tasks , both at home and within institutions. Paid caregivers typically cost $20 per hour (or $160 per day), an expense that most families pay out of pocket. 27 Alzheimer's Association, 2015 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures 28 American Elder Care Research Organization. (2015) Home Care Financial Assistance and Payment Options . 44SLIDE 31: Direct Care Workforce : Challenges29 Workforce shortage o Over 1 million additional needed by 2018 o High turnover o Recruitment difficult Limited training on Alzheimer's and dementia TALKING POINTS: Challeng es within the direct care workforce include workforce shortage and insufficient training. According to one estimate, more than one million additional direct-care workers will be needed by 2018. Turnover rates are high among direct-care workers, and recruitment and retention are persistent challenges. Many direct- care workers receive little training on Alzheimer's and dementia care. Average training is 75 hours, with little focus on Alzheimer's and dementia. 29 Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute (PHI). (2013). Fact Sheet: America's Direct -Care Workforce.

The public health approach can be used to improve the quality of life for those living with the disease , their caregivers, and to reduce the costs associated with the disease. 46SLIDE 33: Healthy People 202030 Alzheimer's and other dementia s included in Healthy People 2020 o Increasing diagnosis and awareness o Reducing preventable hospitalizations TALKING POINTS: For the first time, Alzheimer's and other dementias are included in Healthy People 2020 . Healthy People - released every ten years by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services - is a framework of goals and objectives that is used to guide national health promotion and disease prevention efforts in the U.S. The new topic area - \"Dementias, including Alzheimer's\" - contains specific objectives regarding increasing diagnosis and awareness and reducing preventable hospitalizations . Public health has a role to play in reaching those objectives. Inclusion in Healthy People 2020 underscores the growing public health threat that Alzheimer's and other dementias pose to the nation. 30 Department of Health and Human Services. (2010) Healthy People 2020 . 47SLIDE 34: Role of Public Health 3 key public health intervention tools: o Surveillance/monitoring o Primary prevention (risk reduction) o Early detection and diagnosis TALKING POINTS : (See module 3 for more information) Public heal th plays an important part in addressing Alzheimer's. Three key public health intervention tools that can stem the burden of Alzheimer's disease: Surveillance/monitoring that allows public health to compile data and use it to: o Develop strategies and interventions o Inform public policy o Guide research o Evaluate programs and policies o Educate populations Promoting primary prevention can be used to promote risk reduction for cognitive decline and dementia, as well as promote cognitive health in general. Public health may play an important role in efforts to increase early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, including Educating the public about the warning signs of dementia, benefits of early detection and training to health care providers and newly diagnosed individuals, families, and caregivers. Identifying and promoting strategies designed to promote early detection Image source: Copyright ed image; used with permission from the Alzheimer's Association 48SLIDE 35: Dementia Capable Systems and Dementia Friendly Communities Dementia capable systems o Public health research and translation o Support services o Workforce training Dementia friendly communities TALKING POINTS: (See module 4 for more information.) Public health also has a role to play in supporting dementia capable systems and dementia friendly communities. At a larger level, states and communities can become dementia capable and accommodate the needs of a population with Alzheimer's and other deme ntias. A dementia capable system is a system or infrastructure that works to meet the needs of a people with dementia and their caregivers through providing education, support and services . Public health can contribute to a dementia capable system through: Public health research and translation Ensuring access to support services for people with dementia and their caregivers Workforce training and education Supporting the creation of dementia friendly communities which describes communities that have taken steps to make their community safe for and accessible to people with Alzheimer's and other dementias as well as support and empower people with Alzheimer's and dementia to continue living high - quality lives with as much independence as possible.

Developed as part of a cooperative agreement with CDC's Healthy Aging Program, and in partnership with Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health, this curriculum addresses cognitive health, cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease and is for use by undergraduate faculty in schools and programs of public health. Module 2 : Alzheimer's and Other Dementias - The Basics provides background information on Alzheimer's and other dementias. It lays a foundation for what cognitive health is and how changes within the brain may lead to cognitive aging, cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's and other dementias. The module then shifts to focus more specifically on Alzheimer's disease. Learners gain a general understanding about the three stages of Alzheimer's disease, risk factors, and how the disease is diagnosed and treated. The module also addresses unique aspects of Alzheimer's disease (including financial hardship, stigma, and vulnerability to abuse), and the role and burden of caregivers. Module 2 contains the following topics: Cognitive health Dementia Alzheimer's disease Risk factors Treatment & management Caregivers Unique aspects LEARNING OBJECTIVES At the end of Module 2: Alzheimer's and Other Dementias - The Basics students will be able to: Define cognitive health. Define and differentiate between dementia and Alzheimer's disease . List at least five common symptoms of Alzheimer's disease . Describe the changes that occur during the course of Alzheimer's disease . 71 Identify at least three risk factors associated with Alzheimer's disease .

Open responses. 79SLIDE 6: Cognitive Health1 Cognition: the ability to think, learn, and remember Cognitive health continuum: \"optimal functioning\" to severe disability Linked to brain health TALKING POINTS: To understand what hap pens to a person when he or she develops Alzheimer's or dementia, it is h elpful to first consider cognitive health . Cognition refers to the ability to think, learn, and remember. Cognitive health can be viewed along a continuum. At one end is \"optimal functioning ,\" which refers to a healthy brain that can perform the following mental processes: Ability to learn new things Intuition Judgment Language Remembering At the other end of the spectrum are people with severe Alzheimer's, dementia, and other brain injuries that render that person unable to function cognitively. Cognitive health is linked to brain health in terms of the physiologic health of the brain and overall functioning. 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Healthy Aging. What is a Healthy Brain? New Research Explores Perceptions of Cognitive Health Among Diverse Older Adults . Image source: National Institute on Aging 80SLIDE 7: Cognitive Aging2,3 The brain changes as it ages Increase in wisdom and expertise Speed of processing, making decisions, remembering may decline Normal part of aging TALKING POINTS: Like other organs in the human b ody, the brain changes as it ages. Physical structures in the brain change, and its ability to carry out various functions tends to decline. Wisdom and expertise can increase with age, while the speed of processing information, making decisions, and remembering certain things can decline. This process is known as cognitive aging - a decline in memory, decision-making, processing speed, and learning. For example, a person might have trouble following a recipe, remembering certain words, or finding common items such as glasses or keys. These changes are considered a normal part of aging , are different for different people, and may vary from day to day. 2 Institute of Medicine.

Symptoms of MCI may include: forgetting important information that he or she would previously have easily recalled (such as appointments, conversations, or recent events), or a decreased ability to make sound decisions, judge the time or sequence of steps needed to complete a complex task, or have trouble with visual perception. A person with MCI is at an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's or other dementia. In some cases, however, the condition may be caused by external factors , such as medication, vitamin B12 deficiency, and depression. In these cases, the condition can be reversed, reverse on its own, or remain stable. 4 Alzheimer's Association .

When a person has trouble with cognitive processes that begin to affect the things he or she does in everyday life, it is often referred to as cognitive impairment . Cognitive impairment spans a wide range of functioning. It can occur as a result of Alzheimer's or other dementias, or with other conditions such as stroke and traumatic brain injury. 6 Alzheimer's Association and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Dementia is not a specific disease. It's an overall term that describes a wide range of symptoms associated with a decline in memory or other thinking skills. Dementia is NOT normal aging . It is caused by damage to brain cells from disease or trauma (such as a brain injury or stroke). This damage interferes with the ability of brain cells to communicate with each other. When brain cells cannot communicate normally, thinking, behavior, and feelings can be affected. Many dementias are progressive, meaning symptoms start out slowly and gradually get worse. 7 Alzheimer's Association. What is Dementia?

Vascular dementia is a decline in thinking skills caused by conditions that block or reduce blood flow to the brain, depriving brain cells of vital oxygen and nutrients. In vascular dementia, changes in thinking sometimes occur suddenly following strokes that block major brain blood vessels. Thinking problems may also begin as mild changes that worsen gradually as a result of multiple minor strokes or other conditions that affect smaller blood vessels, leading to cumulative damage. Researchers increasingly believe that many people have mixed vascular dementia and Alzheimer's . ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE TALKING POINTS: The most common type of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. We will focus our attention on understanding more about the stages of Alzheimer's as well as risk factors, treatment and management of the disease. 89SLIDE 15: Alzheimer's Disease : Overview10 Most common type of dementia 60% - 80% of cases Progressive - symptoms gradually worsen over number of years TALKING POINTS: Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia. It accounts for an estimated 60% to 80% of cases. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive disease, in which dement ia symptoms gradually worsen over a number of years. In its mild (early) stages, people experience some memory loss, but with severe (late-stage) Alzheimer's disease, individuals lose the ability to carry on a conversation and respond to their environment. The degenerative nature of the disease means many in the severe stage have difficulty moving, often become bed-bound, and need around-the-clock care. *Note: The image on the slide shows a healthy brain (left side) as compared to a severe Alzheimer's brain (right side). The Alzheimer's brain is significantly smaller than the healthy brain. 10 Alzheimer's Association. What is Alzheimer's?

He noticed certain changes in the brain tissue of a woman who had died after a mental illness that included symptoms of memory loss, language problems, and unpredictable behavior. Dr. Alzheimer examined her brain after her death and found many abnormal clumps (now called amyloid plaques) and tangled bundles of fibers (now called neurofibrillary, or tau, tangles). These plaques and tangles in the brain are still considered some of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, along with the loss of connections between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. 11 National Institute on Aging.

Image source : National Library of Medicine, History of Medicine 91SLIDE 17: Alzheimer's Disease : Physical Changes12 Brain shrinks dramatically o Nerve cell death o Tissue loss Plaques: abnormal clusters of protein fragments Tangles: twisted strands of another protein TALKING POINTS: Alzheimer's disease leads to ne rve cell death and tissue loss throughout the brain. Over time, the brain shrinks dramatically, affecting nearly all its functions. Scientists are not absolutely sure what causes cell death and tissue loss in the Alzheimer's brain, but plaques and tangles are prime suspects. Plaques , abnormal clusters of protein fragments, build up between nerve cells in the brain. Plaques form when protein pieces called beta -amyloid clump together. Dead and dying nerve cells contain tangles , which are made up of twisted strands of another protein. Plaques and tangles tend to spread through the brain in a predictable pattern as Alzheimer's disease progresses. *Note: The image on the slide shows a microscopic illustration of Alzheimer's tissue with plaques and tangles.

Experts agree that in the vast majority of cases, Alzheimer's disease, like other common chronic conditions, probably develops as a result of complex interactions among multiple factors, including age, genetics, environment, lifestyle, and coexisting medical conditions. It is likely that damage to the brain starts a decade or more before symptoms begin to appear. 13 Alzheimer 's Association. Risk Factors.

Younger-onset (also known as early- onset) Alzheimer's disease affects people younger than 65. Many people with early onset Alzheimer's disease are in their 40s and 50s. In the U.S., it is estimated that approximately 200,000 people have younger onset Alzheimer's disease - up to 4% of the population with Alzheimer's disease. 14 Alzheimer's Association.

Challenges in planning or solving problems 3. Difficulty completing familiar tasks 4. Confusion with time or place 5. Trouble understanding visual images and spatial relationships TALKING POINTS: Alzheimer's disease affects people in different ways. Symptoms also change and become more severe as the disease progresses. The most common symptom begins with gradually worsening ability to remember new information . As damage spreads, individuals experience other difficulties. The following are ten warning signs of Alzheimer's disease : 1. Memory loss that disrupts daily life One of the most common signs of Alzheimer's disease, especially in the early stages, is forgetting recently learned information. Others include: forgetting important dates or events; asking for the same information over and over; relying on memory aids (e.g., reminder notes or electronic devices) or family members for things they used to handle on their own. 2. Challenges in planning or solving problems Some people may experience changes in their ability to develop and follow a plan or work with numbers. They may have trouble following a familiar recipe or keeping track of monthly bills. 15 Alzheimer's Association. (2009) Know the 10 Signs . 96They may have difficulty concentrating and take much longer to do things than they did before. 3. Difficulty completing familiar tasks at home, at work or at leisure People with Alzheimer's disease may have a hard time completing daily tasks. Sometimes, people may have trouble driving to a familiar location, managing a budget at work, or remembering the rules of a favorite game. 4. Confusion with time or place People wit h Alzheimer's disease can lose track of dates, seasons, and the passage of time. They may have trouble understanding something if it is not happening immediately. Sometimes they may forget where they are or how they got there. 5. Trouble understanding visual images and spatial relationships For some people, having vision problems is a sign of Alzheimer's disease. They may have difficulty reading, judging distance and determining color or contrast. In terms of perception, they may pass a mirror and think someone else is in the room. They may not recognize their own reflection. 97SLIDE 22: Ten Warning Signs of Alzheimer's (continued)16 6. New problems with words in speaking or writing 7. Misplacing things and losing the ability to retrace steps 8. Decreased or poor judgment 9. Withdrawal from work or social activities 10. Changes in mood and personality TALKING POINTS: 6. New problems with words in speaking or writing People with Alzheimer's disease may have trouble following or joining a conversation. They may stop in the middle of a conversation and have no idea how to continue, or they may repeat themselves. They may struggle with vocabulary, have problems finding the right word, or call things by the wrong name (e.g., calling a watch a \"hand clock\"). 7. Misplacing things and losing the ability to retrace steps A person with Alzheimer's disease may put things in unusual places. They may lose things and be unable to go back over their steps to find them again. Sometimes, they may accuse others of stealing. This may occur more frequently over time. 8. Decreased or poor judgment People with Alzheimer's disease may experience changes in judgment or decision-making. For example, they may use poor judgment when dealing with money, such as giving large amounts to telemarketers. They may pay less attention to grooming or keeping themselves clean. 9. Withdrawal from work or social activities 16 Alzheimer's Ass ociation. (2009) Know the 10 Signs . 98A person with Alzheimer's disease may start to remove themselves from hobbies, social activities, work projects or sports. They may have trouble keeping up with a favorite sports team or remembering how to complete a favorite hobby. They may also avoid being social because of the changes they have experienced. 10. Changes in mood and personality The mood and personalities of people with Alzheimer 's disease can change. They can become confused, suspicious, depressed, fearful or anxious. They may be easily upset at home, at work, with friends, or in places where they are out of th eir comfort zone. 99SLIDE 23: Stages of Alzheimer's Disease17 Average lifespan 4-8 years after diagnosis; as long as 20 years Progresses slowly in 3 stages: o Mild (early-stage) o Moderate (middle-stage) o Severe (late-stage) TALKING POINTS: On avera ge, a person with Alzheimer's disease lives four to eight years after diagnosis, but can live as long as 20 years, depending on many factors (such as the progression of the disease, other co-occurring conditions, infections, and unintentional injuries) . The symptoms of Alzheimer's disease worsen over time, although the rate at which the disease progresses varies . Alzheimer's disease typically progresses slowly in three general stages - mild (early-stage), moderate (middle-stage), and severe (late-stage). *Note: The image on the slide shows the progression of changes to the brain , from preclinical Alzheimer's (top), mild to moderate (middle), to severe (bottom). 17 Alzheimer's Association.

He or she may still drive , work and be part of social activities . Despite this, the person may feel as if he or she is having memory lapses , such as forgetting familiar words or the location of everyday objects . Other common difficulties in the mild stage of Alzheimer's disease include: Trouble remembering names when introduced to new people Having greater difficulty performing tasks in social or work settings Forgetting material that one has just read Increasing trouble with planning or organizing 18 Alzheimer's Association.

In the moderate stage, damage to nerve cells in the brain can make it difficult to express thoughts and perform routine tasks. During this stage, symptoms will be noticeable to others and may include: Forgetfulness of events or about one's own personal history Confusion about where they are or what day it is The need for help choosing proper clothing for the season or the occasion Trouble controlling bladder and bowels in some individuals Changes in sleep patterns, such as sleeping during the day and becoming restless at night An increased risk of wandering and becoming lost 19 Alzheimer's Association.

In the severe stage of Alzheimer's disease, individuals lose the ability to respond to their environment, to carry on a conversation, and, eventually, to control movement. They may still say words or phrases, but communicating becomes difficult. As memory and cognitive skills continue to worsen, personality changes may take place, and individuals need extensive help with daily activities. At t his stage, individuals may: Require full-time, around-the-clock assistance with daily personal care Lose awareness of recent experiences as well as of their surroundings Experience changes i n physical abilities , including the ability to walk, sit, and eventually, swallow Become vulnerable to infections , especially pneumonia 20 Alzh eimer's Association.

As described earlier, in most cases it is likely a combination of genetic , environmental , and lifestyle factors that take place over a long period of time. A number of risk factors have been iden tified that contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease. Other risk factors show evidence of decreased risk pending further research. The greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease is advancing age. Most individuals with the disease are age 65 or older. However, Alzheimer's and dementia are not normal parts of aging. The risk of developing Alzheimer's disease increases with age - it approximately doubles every five years after age 65. In persons age 85 or older, about one in three have Alzheimer's disease. 21 Alzheimer's Association. Risk Factors .

People who have an immediate family member - a parent, brother, sister, or child - with Alzheimer's disease are more likely to develop the disease. This risk increases if more than one family member has the disease. When diseases tend to run in families, either hereditary (genetics) or environmental factors, or both, may play a role. Scientists have identified numerous hereditary genes that either increase the likelihood or guarantee that people with the gene will develop Alzheimer's disease. Risk genes : increase the likelihood of developing a disease, but do not guarantee it will happen. Scientists have identified several risk genes, including APOE-e4, tied to Al zheimer's disease. Deterministic genes : directly cause a disease, guaranteeing that anyone who inherits them will develop the disorder. Scientists have discovered variations that directly cause Alzheimer's disease in the genes of three proteins. This is very rare, representing perhaps 1% of Alzheimer's cases. Onset for Alzheimer's disease related to these genes tends to 23 Alzheimer's Association. Risk Factors .

Researchers are trying to determine the link between dementias and possible environmental factors such as exposure to pesticides, food additives, air pollution and other problematic chemical compounds. Several studies have demonstrated that fewer years of formal education and lower levels of cognitive engagement are indicators of risk for dementia. People who have more years of formal education have lower rates of Alzheimer's and other dementias than those with less education. Additional studies suggest that remaining socially and mentally active throughout life may support brain health and possibly reduce the risk of Alzheimer's and other dementias. Some researchers have proposed a \"cognitive reserve\" hypothesis, in which ongoing mental activity and stimulation, such as through education, occupation, leisure activity, mental and physical activity, may help p rotect the brain against damage and decline. 108SLIDE 30: Risk Factors: Race & Ethnicity24 African-Americans: 2 times greater risk Hispanics: 1.5 times greater risk Cardiovascular risk factors more common Lower levels of education, socioeconomic status TALKING POINTS: Race and ethnicity may also contrib ute to increased risk of developing Alzheimer's and other dementias. In the U.S., older African-Americans are about two times more likely than older whites to h ave Alzheimer's disease. First-degree relatives of African-Americans with Alzheimer's disease have a 43% chance of developing dementia. Older Hispanics are about one and one-half times more likely than older whites to have Alzheimer's disease . Variations in health, lifestyle and socioeconomic circumstances across racial groups likely account for most of the differences in risk of Alzheimer's and other dementias by race. For example, African-American and Hispanic communities have higher incidence of certain Alzheimer's r isk factors: Conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes which are risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, are more common in African-Americans and Hispanic populations than in whites. Lower levels of education and other socioeconomic characteristics (such as lower income, access to quality care) among older racial and ethnic minorities may also contribute to increased risk. Some studies suggest that differences based on race and ethnicity do not persist in rigorous analyses that account for such risk factors. 24 Alzheimer's Association . 2016 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures .

Among those aged 71 and older, 16% of women have Alzheimer's and other dementias, compared with 11% of men. At age 65, women without Alzheimer's disease have more than a one in six chance of developing Alzheimer's disease during the remainder of their lives, compared with a one in 11 chance for men. Women in their 60s are about twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's disease over the rest of their lives as they are to develop breast cancer. This may be primarily explained by the fact that women live longer, on average, than men. However, researchers are increasingly questioning whether there may be other reasons for the difference in the number of women and men who develop the disease. 25 Alzheimer's Association, AAIC Press Release , July 21, 2015 26 Alzheimer's Association, Public Health E-News , July 22, 2015 Image source: National Cancer Institute, NCI Visuals Online, Daniel Sone (Photographer) 110SLIDE 32: Modifiable Risk Factors: Head Trauma27 Moderate and severe traumatic brain injury o Moderate injury: 2.3 times greater risk o Severe injury: 4.5 times greater risk Risk remains for years after injury TALKING POINTS: There are some risk factors that may be changed or prevented to help reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Research has linked moderate and severe traumatic brain injury to a greater risk of developing Alzheimer's or another type of dementia years after the original head injury. One of the key studies showing an increased risk found that older adults with a history of moderate traumatic brain injury (unconsciousness lasting more than 30 minutes) had a 2.3 times greater risk of developing Alzheimer's disease than seniors with no history of head injury. Those with a history of severe traumatic brain injury (unconsciousness lasting more than 24 hours) had a 4.5 times greater risk. Also, people with repeated head injuries (such as boxers, football players, and combat veterans) are at an even higher risk of developing dementia. 27 Alzheimer's Association. (2015) Traumatic Brain Injury 33: Modifiable Risk Factors: Lifestyle28,29 Increases risk o Current smoking o Midlife obesity Decreases risk o Physical activity o Heart-healthy diets: DASH, Mediterranean diet o Mental and social activity TALKING POINT S: Certain lifestyle factors may help to protect against developing Alz heimer's and other dementias. There is fairly strong evidence that current smoking increases the risk of cognitive decline and possibly also dementia, and that quitting smoking may reduce the associated risk to levels comparable to those who have never smoked. Diet and physical activity may help to prevent against obesity ; midlife obesity has been shown to increase risk for Alzheimer's and other dementias. Exercise may also directly benefit brain cells by increasing blood and oxygen flow in the brain. Current evidence also suggests that eating a heart-healthy diet may also help protect the brain against cognitive decline. Two diets that have been studied and may be beneficial are the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet and the Mediterranean diet . 28 Alzheimer's Association.

The Mediterranean diet includes relatively little red meat and emphasizes whole grains, fruits and vegetables, fish and shellfish, and nuts, olive oil and other healthy fats. Some studies have also indicated that staying cognitively and socially active may help reduce the risk of cognitive decline. This involves mentally stimulating activities and social connections. 113SLIDE 34: Modifiable Risk Factors: Cardiovascular30 Heart-head connection Cardiovascular risk factors: o High blood pressure in midlife o Heart disease o Stroke o Diabetes TALKING POINTS: Growing evid ence su ggest s that the health of the brain is closely linked to the overall health of the heart and blood vessels . The brain is nourished by one of the body's richest networks of blood vessels. With every beat, the heart pumps about 20% to 25% of the blood to the head, where brain cells use at least 20% of the food and oxygen carried by the blood in order to function normally. As a result, many factors that damage the heart or blood vessels may also damage the brain - and may increase the risk for developing Alzheimer's and other dementias. Several conditions known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease - including high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes - appear to increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Some autopsy studies show that as many as 80% of individuals with Alzheimer's disease also have cardiovascular disease. 30 Alzheimer's Association. Prevention and Risk of Alzheimer's & Dementia .

Establishing a diagnosis for Alzheimer's disease can be more challenging. There is no single test that can show whether a person has Alzheimer's disease . A careful medical evaluation is required, which includes: A thorough medical history Mental status testing Information from family and friends A physical and neurological exam Tests (such as blood tests and brain imaging) to rule out other causes of dementia-like symptoms. 31 Alzheimer's Association.

Drug and non-drug treatments may help with both cognitive and behavioral symptoms , but don't affect the under lying disease. Medications are used to treat symptoms and are more effective if administered after early diagnosis. The chief goals of treatment are to: Maintain quality of life Maximize function in daily activities Enhance cognition, mood and behavior Foster a safe environment Promote social engagement, as appropriate 32 Alzheimer's Association. Health Care Professionals and Alzheimer's . Accessed June chronic conditions (e.g., heart disease, diabetes, depression) Difficult to manage Higher rates of hospitalizations and costs o 3 times as many hospital stays o 3 times average Medicare costs Preventable hospitalizations TALKING POINTS: Trea ting people with Alzheimer's often requires the management of co-morbidities . Co-morbidities refer to additional chronic conditions - such as heart disease, diabetes, depression, and arthritis - that are present in combination with a primary disease. People with Alzheimer's and dementia are more likely to have co-morbidities than other older people without dementia. The cognitive problems associated with Alzheimer's disease and dementia can lead to poor management of co- morbidities. On average, people with dementia have three times as many hospital stays and have three times the average Medicare costs of other older people. Most of the hospitalizat ions are not for Alzheimer's disease itself, but for these other conditions that are often complicated by, or result from, Alzheimer's disease. Many of these hospitalizations are preventable (or potentially avoidable) with better quality care and management of co- morbidities. 33 Alzheimer's Association.

Those with dementia at any age may need to pay for additional services, especially as the disease progresses. As the need for care intensifies , many people with Alzheimer's and dementia may live in nursing homes for long periods of time. The financial burden of this care can result in turning to Medicaid and other public programs to help pay for their services and support. People with dementia report being afraid of the reactions of others and a lower perceived status within society because of the diagnosis. The stigma associated with dementia may contribute to social exclusion , a reluctance to seek help or even a diagnosis, a sense of shame and inadequacy , and low self-esteem . People with Alzheimer's and other dementias tend to be especially vulnerable to abuse because the disease may prevent them from reporting the abuse or recognizing it. Abuse can occur anywhere, including at home and in care settings. Abuse can take many forms: Physical : physical pain or injury 34 Alzheimer's Association. Abuse . Accessed July 16, 2015 from website: https://www.alz.org/care/alzheimers-dementia-elder-abuse.asp 120 Emotional : verbal assaults, threats of abuse, harassment and intimidation Neglect : failure to provide necessities, including food, clothing, shelter, medical care or a safe environment Financial : the misuse or withholding of the person's financial resources (money, property) to his or her disadvantage or the advantage of someone else 121SLIDE 41: CAREGIVERS TALKING POINTS: Most people with Alzheimer's disease have a primary caregiver - often a family member - who is crucial to ensuring appropriate care. As the person with Alzheimer's declines, the primary caregiver(s) often takes on an increasing role in advocating for and attending to all aspects of the person's health and well-being as well as all their financial affairs . 122SLIDE 42: Alzheimer's: Caregivers35 Responsibilities: o Dressing, bathing, toileting, feeding o Shopping, meal preparation, transportation o Medication o Financial management o Emotional support Increasing levels of care Results in complete dependence TALKING POINTS: The term care giver is used to describe a person who provides a level of care and support for another that exceeds typical responsibilities of daily life. Caregiving responsibilities, especially in the moderate and severe stages, often include: Helping with dressing , bathing , toileting , and feeding Shopping , meal preparation , transportation , medication management , and financial management Providing emotional support People with Alzheimer's require increasing levels of caregiving as the disease progresses; more severe stages may require constant supervision and result in complete dependence on caregivers (paid or unpaid). 35 Alzheimer's Association.

Due to the physical and emotional toll of caring for someone with Alzheimer's or other dementias, these caregivers had $10.2 billion in additional health care costs in 2014. Nearly 60% of Alzheimer's and dementia caregivers rate the emotional stress of caregiving as high or very high. About 40% of Alzheimer's and dementia caregivers suffer from depression. 36 Alzheimer's Association. 2016 Alzheimer 's Disease Facts and Figures .

The symptoms of Alzheimer's disease worsen over time, although the rate at which the disease progresses varies . On average, a person with Alzheimer's disease lives four to eight years after diagnosis, but can live as long as 20 years, depending on other factors. Risk factors for Alzheimer's disease include: o Age o Years of formal education o Fami ly history o Head trauma o Education o Lifestyle (current smoking, physical activity, diet, mental and social activity) 125o Cardiovascular conditions (including high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes) African-Americans, Hispanics, and women are mor e likely to develop Alzheimer's disease. o In the U.S., older African-Americans are about two times more likely than older whites to have Alzheimer's disease. First -degree relatives of African- Americans with Alzheimer's disease have a 43% chance of developing dementia. o Older Hispanics are about one and one-half times more likely than older whites to have Alzheimer's disease. o Almost 2/3 of U.S. adults with Alzheimer's disease are women . 126SLIDE 45: Role of Public Health 3 key public health intervention tools: o Surveillance/monitoring o Primary prevention (risk reduction) o Early detection and diagnosis TALKING POINTS: (see module 3 for more information) Public health plays an im portant part in addressing Alzheimer's. Three key public health intervention tools that can reduce the burden of Alzheimer's disease: Surveillance/monitoring that allows public health to compile data and use it to : o Develop interventions o Inform public policy o Guide research o Educate populations Promoting primary prevention can be used to promote risk reduction and promote cognitive health . Public health may play an important role increasing early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease Image source: Copyright ed image; used with permission from the Alzheimer's Association 127SLIDE 46: Dementia Capable Systems and Dementia Friendly Communities Dementia capable systems o Public health research and translation o Support services o Workforce training Dementia friendly communities TALKING POINTS: (see module 4 for more information) At a larger level, states and communities can become dementia capable in accommodating the needs of a popu lation with Alzheimer's and other dementias. A dementia capable system is a system or infrastructure that works to meet the needs of a people with dementia and their caregivers through providing education, support and services. Public health can contribute to a dementia capable system through: Public health research and translation Ensuring access to support services for people with dementia and their caregivers Workforce training and education Supporting the creation of dementia friendly communities which describes communities that have taken steps to make their community safe for and accessible to people with Alzheimer's and other dementias as well as support and empower people with Alzheimer's and dementia to continue living high - quality lives with as much independence as possible.

Developed as part of a cooperative agreement with CDC's Healthy Aging Program, and in partnership with Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health, this curriculum addresses cognitive health, cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease and is for use by undergraduate faculty in schools and programs of public health. Module 3: Alzheimer's Disease - What is the Role of Public Health? briefly describes the Alzheimer's disease epidemic in the U.S., followed by a discussion of three tools of public health that may play significant roles in mitig ating the Alzheimer's disease crisis. The three public health intervention tools discussed are: 1. Surveillance/monitoring 2. Primary prevention 3. Early detection and diagnosis Each tool is described and applied to the context of a public health response to Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Progress to date and challenges associated with each tool are addressed. LEARNING OBJECTIVES At the end of Module 3 : Alzheimer's Disease - What is the Role of Public Health? students will be able to: List three key tools publi c health can apply to the Alzheimer's epidemic. Describe surveillance/monitoring and how public health practitioners can apply it in response to Alzheimer's disease. Name the two Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) modules that pertain to cognitive decline and care giving. Describe primary prevention and how public health practitioners may apply it in response to Alzheimer's disease. Explain why it is important to promote early detection of Alzheimer's disease. 156COMPETENCIES Module 3 promotes basic learning that supports the development of certain competencies: Association for Gerontology in Higher Education (AGHE): 1.2.4 Recognize common late-life syndromes and diseases and their related bio- psycho-social risk and protective factors.

The term dementia is a general term for a decline in mental abilities that is severe enough to interfere with daily life. Dementia, which is not a disease but a syndrome, is characterized by damage to the brain cells due to age, brain injury, other conditions or diseases or heredity. There are several types of dementia and most occur in those over 65; however, there are types of dementia that occur in those younger than 65. Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia. Alzheimer's is a progressive disease that ranges from mild to 1 Alzheimer's Association. 2015 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures . 165severe cognitive impairment that occurs over the course of several years. There is no cure for Alzheimer's. While there are approved drug treatments , the goal of treatment is to delay or reduce symptoms, not to cure or reverse the course of the disease. As the person with Alzheimer's loses memory and function, caregivers , who are most often family members, are needed to provide increasing amounts of assistance. This assistance can range from helping to manage finances and household tasks to hands-on care, such as bathing, dressing, feeding and other activities of daily living. Given the nature of the disease and its increasing prevalence, there is a huge financial, emotional and physical impact on people with Alzheimer's, their families, caregivers, and the health care system as a whole. Public health plays an important role in addressing Alzheimer's disease through surveillance, prevention, detection, and support of dementia capable systems. In this presentation, we will be focusing on the role of public health. Video supplements : \"What Mystery of Alzheimer Disease\". National Institutes of Health, NIH Senior Health.

Yet as more is learned about t hese conditions and the impact they are having on society, there is a growing recognition of Alzheimer's and dementia as issues in which public health has an important role to play. Alzheimer's disease is a public health crisis because : The epidemic is large and growing The impact on populations and communities is substantial There are ways to intervene using a public health approach to achieve meaningful improvements in health outcomes Image source: U.S. federal government, Wikimedia Commons 167SLIDE 7: Alzheimer's: Epidemic (U.S.)2 Over 5 million adults 1 in 9 adults age 65 1 in 3 adults age 85 By 2050, expected to reach 13.8 million TALKING POINTS: Today, over 5 million adults in the U.S. are living with Alzheimer's disease, including an estimated 200,000 under the age of 65. One in nine adults age 65 and older (11%) currently has Alzheimer's disease; approximately one in three people age 85 and older have the disease. By 2050, the number of Americans living with Alzheimer's disease is expected to total 13.8 million and could be as high as 16 million . 2 Alzheimer's Association. 2016 Alzheimer's 168SLIDE Significant costs to Medicare, indivi duals, caregivers Annual costs of care over $200 billion Most expensive disease in the U.S. TALKING POINTS: Alzheimer's disease imposes significant costs on federal and state budgets through Medicare and Medicaid, as well as on individuals, families, and caregivers. In the U.S. the annual costs of direct care for people with Alzheimer's disease exceeds $200 billion . \"Direct care\" includes both paid health care and long-term care. It does not include caregiving (an essential part of Alzheimer's care). Alzheimer's disease is the most expensive disease to treat and provide care for in America, costing more than heart disease and cancer. 3 Alzheimer's Association. 2016 Alzheimer's Disease Facts African-Americans: 2 times more likely Hispanics: 1.5 times more likely TALKING POINTS: Alzheimer's disease disproportionately impacts women and minority p opulations. Women make up 2/3 of the population with Alzheimer's disease. In the U.S., African-Americans and Hispanics have higher rates of Alzheimer's and other dementias than whites. Available data indicate that in the United States, older African-Americans are about two times more likely than older whites to have Alzheimer's and other dementias. Older Hispanics are about one and one-half times more likely than older whites to have these conditions. 4 Alzheimer's Association. 2016 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures .

Later stages may require constant supervision and involve complete dependence on caregivers. Currently, it is estimated that over 15 million family members and friends provide nearly 18 billion hours of unpaid care annually. Financially, these contributions are valued at over $215 billion . As a result of their role in caring for someone with Alzheimer's disease, c aregivers often face significant hardships related to their own health, emotional wellbeing, and financial stability. 5 Alzheimer's Association . 2016 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures . 171SLIDE 11: Alzheimer's: Health Care Burden6,7,8 Disproportionate use of health care resources o Hospitalized 2-3 times more often o Represents 64% of Medicare beneficiaries living in nursing homes Workforce shortage Inadequate training TALKING POINTS: The burden of Alzheimer's and other dementias on the health care system is significant. Individuals with Alzheimer's disease use a disproportionate amount of health care resources. For example, they are hospitalized 2 to 3 times more than older adults without the disease. In addition, of all Medicare beneficiaries residing in a nursing home , 64% have Alzheimer' s and other dementias. With the growing number of older adults in the U.S. population (both with and without Alzheimer' s and other dementias), the country is facing a workforce shortage of health care professionals who are trained to meet the needs of older adults. Many professionals already in the workforce are not adequately trained on the needs of people with Alzheime r's and other dementias. 6 Alzheimer's Association.

Many public health efforts that address detection, risk reduction, and alleviating disease burden, are implemented at state and local levels . Developing effective responses to the Alzheimer's epidemic necessitates understanding how Alzheimer's and dementia impact states and communities. 10 Alzheimer's Association. (2014) Data Collection and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) . 175SLIDE 15: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)11 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) - CDC o Health-related risk behaviors o Chronic health conditions o Use of preventive services State-based data Cognitive Decline module, Caregiver module TALKING POINTS: In the U.S., state-based data on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services is collected through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) . The BRFSS is the nation's premier system for collecting data on health-related risk behaviors, chronic conditions and use of preventive services. The survey is conducted by telephone and is collected at the state level by all 50 states and US territories. It is a partnership between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state health departments. The survey is conducted by state health departments and is comprised of core component questions, optional modules and state- based questions. In recent years, the CDC developed two BRFSS modules that enable states to collect data on the impact of cognitive decline and caregiving . The two BRFSS modules are the Cognitive Decline module and the Caregiver module. 11 Alzheimer's Association. (2014) Data Collection and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRF SS).

Common examples of primary prevention in public health include: regular physical activity to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease; vaccination against infectious diseases; and anti-tobacco use campaigns and quit-lines. Secondary and tertiary prevention refer to identifying and managing a disease at its earliest stage, and minimizing or reducing complications of or disability resulting from a disease, respectively. Research hasn't yet revealed the exact causes of Alzheimer's in most people, but findings suggest there are ways to reduce risk for the disease, as well as ways to promote cognitive health at the population level. 17 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Open responses. 183SLIDE 23: Risk Reduction: Head Trauma18,19 Moderate or severe traumatic brain injury Risk remains for years after original injury Prevention efforts include: o Seat belt use o Use of helmets o Falls prevention TALKING POINTS: Research has linked moderate and severe trau matic brain injury to a greater risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The risk remains even years after the original head injury. Prevention efforts for the general public may include: Promoting seat belt use (through education and policy) Promoting the use of helmets when bicycling and participating in certain sports (through education and policy) Falls prevention , including: o Putting safety measures in place at home (such as reducing tripping hazards, adding grab bars, and improving lighting) o Exercise to improve balance and coordination o Reviewing medicines and vision with health care provider o Getting enough sleep 18 Alzheimer's Association.

Several conditions known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease - including high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes - appear to increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Many cardiovascular disease risk factors are modifiable - that is, they can be changed to decrease the likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease. Many experts believe that controlling cardiovascular risk factors may be the most cost-effective and helpful approach to protecting brain health. Risk factors that may be modified include: Quitting smoking: Smoking has a negative effect on 20 Alzheimer's Association.

Diet: Current evidence also suggests that eating a heart-healthy diet may also help protect the brain. Two diets that have been studied and may be beneficial are the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet and the Mediterranean diet . Physical activity: Regular physical activity is important for heart health, and may help lower the risk of Alzheimer's and vascular dementia. Exercise may directly benefit brain cells by increasing blood and oxygen flow in the brain. Adults who are 65 or older and generally fit (with no limiting health conditions) should engage in 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity (such as brisk walking) a week and muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms). 186SLIDE 25: Risk Reduction: Avoidance/Management23 Prevent onset of or effectively manage conditions that can increase risk for Alzheimer's o Diabetes o High blood pressure (hypertension) o Midlife obesity TALKING POINTS: Growing evidence suggests that the avoidance and management of diabetes , high blood pressure (hypertension), and midlife obesity may reduce risk for Alzheimer's and other dementias . There is even stronger evidence that these factors may also help protect against cognitive decline in general. Preventing and managing these and other chronic diseases and conditions have been priorities of public health practice for many years. The increasing evidence base about the impact of these conditions on cognitive health must also be taken into account and incorporated into public health practice going forw ard. 23 Baumgart, M., Snyder, H., Carrillo, M., Fazio, S., et.al, Summary of the evidence on modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia: A population-based perspective.

Mentally stimulating activities may include: Learning new information and skills Volunteering Reading Playing challenging games (such as bridge, chess, Sudoku, etc.) Other studies have also suggested a link between social connections and cognitive health. Keeping strong social connections may help reduce the risk of cognitive decline. 24 National Institute on Aging. (2015) Alzheimer's Disease: Unraveling the Mystery .

Open responses. 189SLIDE 28: Risk Reduction: Public Health25,26 Health education and promotion campaigns o Brain and cardiovascular health o Detection/treatment of diabetes and high blood pressure o Smoking cessation Programs and policies o Injury prevention o Cardiovascular health TALKING POINTS: Public health may design and implement health education and promotion campaigns that directly promote brain health and risk reduction strategies, or incorporate brain health messages into cardiovascular health campaigns. Similarly, reducin g risk for Alzheimer's disease is in line with public health efforts to improve detection and treatment of diabetes and high blood pressure , and promote smoking cessation . Such campaigns should include in their target audience older adults , which is a population that has rarely been specifically targeted in prevention programs. Evidence- based interventions are also needed to increase physical activity and promote heart-healthy diets among older people. To achieve health equity goals, public health campaigns 25 Alzheimer's Disease International.

(2013) The Public Health Road Map for State and National Partnerships, 2013- 2018. Image source: National Cancer Institute, NCI Visuals Online, Bill Branson (Photographer) 190need culturally appropriate education and awareness campaigns for heart health and brain health. These are especially important for African-Americans and Hispanics, who are at higher risk of Alzheimer's disease as well as for high blood pressure and diabetes. Public health and its partners may also initiate or strengthen programs and policies aimed at risk reduction for Alzheimer's disease. Programs and policies could help ensure access to: Injury prevention resources (e.g., helmets, falls prevention assets) Safe and accessible public spaces Options for healthy eating , physical activity , and social connections 191SLIDE 29: Tool #3: Early Detection & Diagnosis TALKING POINTS: Promoting early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is another important tool of public health. 192SLIDE 30: Discussion Question Would you want to know if you had Alzheimer's disease?

Open responses. 193SLIDE 31: Why Promote Early Detection?27,28,29,30 Access to treatment and services Planning Potentially reversible causes Clinical trials TALKING POINTS: Promoting and assuring early detection of disease and disability is a third tool of public health, and is vitally important for people with Alzheimer's and dementia . Although there are no pharmacological treatments that change the course of the disease, there are numerous reasons why early detection is important: Access to treatment and services: A formal diagnosis allows individuals and their caregivers to have access to available treatments , build a care team, and identify support services . It may help individuals: Begin medication to help manage symptoms Identify health care professionals to help with different aspects of the disease (such as primary care, neurologist, psychiatrist, etc.) 27 Alzheimer's Association.

All of these factors may help reduce the burden on people with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers, and may also reduce health care costs by delaying placement in long-term facilities. Planning : Early detection of Alzheimer's and other dementias can also help individuals and their families make important decisions and plans surrounding care, treatment options, and finances. Many people with Alzheimer's disease may benefit from creating advance directives -legal documents that specify the type of medical and end- of-life care a person wants to receive once he or she can no longer make or communicate these decisions. Reversible Causes : In some cases, dementia-like symptoms are not actually dementia, but are due to reversible causes. Research suggests that the cognitive impairment in 9% of individuals experiencing dementia-like symptoms is due to a potentially reversible cause, such as depression or a vitamin B12 deficiency. Clinical Trials: Having access to clinical trials provides individuals with the opportunity to access the latest experimental approaches available and provides them with care by clinical research staff. Clinical trials and clinical studies on Alzheimer's and other dementias focus on numerous aspects of these conditions: Helping people with Alzheimer's disease maintain their mental functioning and manage symptoms Slowing , delaying , or preventing Alzheimer's disease It is important for diverse populations to participate in clinical studies. This is especially true for African American and Hispanic populations, both of which are at increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. 195SLIDE 32: Early Detection: Diagnosis Rates31,32 Most people with Alzheimer's disease have either: o Not been diagnosed o Been diagnosed but are not aware of diagnosis Only 35% aware of diagnosis Health disparities TALKING POINTS: Despite the many benefits of early detection and diagnosis, most people living with Alzheimer's disease either: Have not been diagnosed, or Have been diagnosed but neither they nor their caregiver is aware of the diagnosis. A key challenge facing the early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is that many individuals and their caregivers are not being told of the diagnosis, even when their doctor has diagnosed it. A recent analysis by the CDC that found that among people with Alzheimer's or another dementia, they or their caregivers reported being aware of the diagnosis only in 35% of the cases . (for more information: https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/dat a- search/Search-the-Data#objid=4158) These rates are far below diagnoses for other chronic diseases. Analyses have shown that 90% or more of those diagnosed with cancer and cardiovascular disease, for example, were aware of their diagnosis. 31 Alzheimer's Association. 2015 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures 32 Alzheimer's Association . (2013) Alzheimer's and Public Health Spotlight: & Alzheimer's Disease . Image source: clker.com 196There are also health disparities surrounding diagnosis. Medicare data show that African-Americans are even less likely than whites to be diagnosed. Furthermore, when they are diagnosed, African-Americans and Hispanics - possibly due to issues surrounding access to health care - are typically diagnosed in later stages of the disease, resulting in higher use of health care services and substantially higher costs. In the next slide, we will look at possible reasons for the lower rate of diagnosis and disclosure. [Note to Presenters: It was more common in the past for physicians to withhold a serious diagnosis from patients. For example, survey results published in 1961, indicated that 9 in 10 physicians said it was their usual policy to not tell patients that they had been diagnosed with cancer. Typical reasons included not causing patients unnecessary anxiety or depression, a perceived lack of effective treatments, and not wanting to take away hope.] 197SLIDE 33: Early Detection: Challenges33,34 Diagnostic uncertainty Time constraints, lack of support Communication difficulties Fear of causing emotional distress Reluctance to discuss with health care provider TALKING POINTS: There are many reasons why Alzheimer's and other demen tias go undiagnosed or diagnosed but not disclosed to the patient. Diagnostic uncertainty: Health care providers frequently cite the complexity and uncertainty of the diagnosis as barriers to disclosure. Time constraints and lack of support: Disclosing a diagnosis of Alzheimer's or another dementia to a patient usually requires discussion of treatment options and support services, as well as education about the disease and what to expect. In many health care settings, providers have insufficient time to properly a ssess the patient. Physicians and other health care providers have also noted that there are insufficien t resources and services to provide patients and caregivers with the support needed at the time of diagnosis and afterward. A new Medicare billing code to support care planning aims to address this barrier. Communication difficulties : Many providers report challenges in communication skills related to 33 Alzheimer's Association. 2016 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures . 34 Alzheimer's Association. (2015) Cognitive Data from the 2012 BRFSS . 198disclosing a diagnosis of Alzheimer's or other dementias. Fear of causing emotional distress : One of the most common reasons family members and health care providers give for not disclosing an Alzheimer's diagnosis is fear of causing emotional distress . However, studies have found that few patients become depressed or have other long-term emotional problems because of the diagnosis. Reluctance to discuss with health care provider : Many people are reluctant to discuss memory or cognitive issues with their health care provider. The 2012 BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) survey in 21 states found that 77% of people who have experienced subjective cognitive decline have not talked to their health care provider about it. 199SLIDE 34: Early Detection: Most Want to Know35 89% of U.S. adults would want to know Of those age 60 and older, 95% would want to know 97% would want to know for family member TALKING POINTS: Despite the barriers to diagnosis, studies show that most U.S. adults would want to know if they had Alzheimer's disease. Nearly 89% of Americans say that if they were exhibiting confusion and memory loss, they would want to know if the cause of the symptoms was Alzheimer's disea se. Of those aged 60 and older, 95% say they would want to know. Over 97% say that if they had a family member exhibiting problems with memory loss, they would want them to see a doctor to determine if the cause was Alzheimer's disease. 35 Alzheimer's Association.

Identifying and promoting culturally appropriate strategies designed to promote early detection. Public health may also play a role in providing education to health care providers about the importance of early detection and diagnosis. Education provided to the medical community should include topics such as: The importance of discussing memory issues with older patients The availability and use of tools and guidelines to identify dementia, including validated cognitive assessment tools 36 Alzheimer's Association.

The strengths and capacities of public health can also be used to: Promote advance care planning and advance financial planning to care partners, families, and individuals with Alzheimer's and dementia in the early stages before function declines. Inform and connect people to private and public resources that may help with treatment, support services, and information Promote awareness of abuse and exploitation , and support related prevention efforts as they pertain to a person with Alzheimer's or other dementias.

Conduct surveillance and monitoring Surveillance allows public health to compile data on a population level and use it to : Develop strategies and interventions Inform public policy Guide research Evaluate programs and policies Educate populations 2. Promote primary prevention Primary prevention can be used to promote risk reduction for Alzheimer's disease, as well as promote cognitive health in general. Public health may design and implement health education and promotion campaigns to promote brain health and risk reduction strategies, reaching wide audiences and affecting change on the population level. Public health and its partners may also initiate or strengthen programs and policies aimed at risk reduction for Alzheimer's disease. Programs and policies could help ensure access to: 37 Image source: Copyrighted image; used with permission from the Alzheimer's Association 204 Injury prevention resources (e.g., helmets, falls prevention assets) Safe and accessible public spaces Health care services that improve management of cardiovascular risk factors, diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), and midlife obesity Options for help with quitting smoking, healthy eating, physical activity, and social connections 3. Promote early detection and diagnosis Public health may play an important role in efforts to increase early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, including: Educating the public about the warning signs of dementia (such as the \"10 Warning Signs\"), and the benefits of early detection Identifying and promoting culturally appropriate strategies designed to promote early detection Providing education and training to health care providers and newly diagnosed individuals, families, and caregivers. 205SLIDE 38: Dementia Capable Systems and Dementia Friendly Communities38 Dementia capable systems o Public health research and translation o Support services o Workforce training Dementia friendly communities TALKING POINTS: (See module 4 for more information) Public health also has a role to play in supporting dementia capable systems and dementia friendly communities. At a larger level, states and communities can become dementia capable in accommodating the needs of a population with Alzheimer's and other dementias. A dementia capable system is a system or infrastructure that works to meet the needs of a people with dementia and their caregivers through providing education, support and services. Public health can contribute to a dementia capable system through: Public health research and translation Ensuring access to support services for people with dementia and their caregivers Workforce training and education Supporting the creation of dementia friendly communities which describes communities that have taken steps to make their community safe for and accessible to people with Alzheimer's and dementia as well as support and empower people with Alzheimer's and dementia to continue living high - quality lives with as much independence as possible. 38 Image source: Copyright ed image; used with permission from the Alzheimer's Association 206SLIDE 39: For More Information For more information, please visit the Alzheimer's Association website at: http://www.alz.org TALKING POINTS: For more information on the topics covered in this presentation, please go to the Alzheimer's Association website at http://w ww.alz.org .

The term dementia is a general term for a decline in mental abilities that is severe enough to interfere with daily life. Dementia, which is not a disease but a syndrome, is characterized by damage to the brain cells due to age, brain injury, other conditions or diseases or heredity. There are several types of dementia and most occur in those over 65; however, there are types of dementia that occur in those younger than 65. 1 Alzheimer's Association. 2016 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures . 239 Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia. Alzheimer's is a progressive disease that ranges from mild to severe cognitive impairment that occurs over the course of several years. There is no cure for Alzheimer's. While there are approved drug treatments , the goal of treatment is to delay or reduce symptoms, not to cure or reverse the course of the disease. As the person with Alzheimer's loses memory and function, caregivers , who are most often family members, are needed to provide increasing amounts of assistance. This assistance can range from helping to manage finances and household tasks to hands-on care, such as bathing, dressing, feeding and other activities of daily living. Given the nature of the disease and its increasing prevalence, there is a huge financial, emotional and physical impact on people with Alzheimer's, their families, caregivers, and the health care system as a whole. Public health plays an important role in addressing Alzheimer's disease through surveillanc e, prevention, detection, and support of dementia-capable systems . In this presentation, we will be focusing on dementia capable systems and dementia friendly communities, both of which involve government and health care agencies, organizations and communities accommodating the needs of people with dementia and their caregivers through providing education, services and support within their community. Video supplements : \"What the Brain: Unraveling the Mystery of Alzheimer Disease\". National Institutes of Health, NIH Senior Health. (run time: States/communities play significant role o Assessing burden o Risk reduction o Care services: health care, support services government agencies o Public and private resources: transportation, grocery stores, places of worship, financial institutions, law enforcement TALKING POINTS: Alzhei mer's and dementia are often considered in terms of the toll these conditions take on individuals , families , and caregivers . As an epidemic , Alzheimer's and dementia also need to be addressed within a larger context. States and communities have many people li ving with Alzheimer's and other dementias, as well as many others who are at risk for developing these conditions. States must assess the burden of Alzheimer's and dementia and take steps to reduce risk and provide support to affected populations. At a community level, individuals with Alzheimer's and dementia and their caregivers rely on many care services , including health care, support services (in-home, community, and long-term care), and government agencies for their daily care needs. They also interact with and depend on public and private resources such as transportation, grocery stores, places of worship, financial institutions, and law enforcement. 2 Image source: clker.com 241A public health response to the epidemic must therefore take into consideration the unique needs of people with Alzheimer's and dementia on state and local levels , within institutions, and across communities. 242SLIDE 7: Dementia Capable Systems3,4,5 Accommodate needs of population with: o Memory loss o Physical, cognitive, behavior al symptoms o Co-morbidities Knowledgeable workforce/residents: o Identify people with dementia o Work effectively with them o Inform/refer to services TALKING POINTS: During this presentation, we will discuss both dementia capable systems and dementia friendly communities . Each has an important part to play in helping people with dementia and their loved ones navigate the journey with dementia. First, we will discuss dementia capable systems . Dementia capable means being able to help people with dementia and their caregivers. This definition applies both to dementia capable systems and dementia friendly communities. More specifically, being dementia capable means being skilled in identifying people with possible dementia and working effectively with them and their caregivers, being knowledgeable about the kinds of services needed, and being able to inform or refer to agencies and individuals that provide such services. A dementia capable system is a system that accommodat es the needs of a population that, in addition to memory loss, experiences a variety of physical , cognitive , and behavior al 3 Alzheimer's Association and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Dementia capable systems can be implemented at different levels, such as within a care system, a business or organization, or within a community or state . The focus of dementia capable systems is often on: Increasing knowledge and skills of those who will help care for or interact with people who have dementia and their loved ones Addressing service gaps and specialized assistance needs Providing long term services and support systems to fulfill the needs of people with dementia and their caregivers Public health must take an active role in fostering dementia capable systems and helping to bridge the gap between the needs of individuals and caregivers and the larger establishments within states and communities that can best meet those needs. 244SLIDE 8: Dementia Capable: Public Health6 Public health research and translation Support services and programs Workforce training Dementia friendly communities TALKING POINTS: Public health may play a role i n developing and supporting dementia capable systems by: Conducting public health research and translating the findings through policy, programs, and best practices Servi ng to provide, inform and connect individuals and caregivers to support services and programs Designing and implementing workforce training to ensure workers across a wide range of professions are able to identify and meet the needs of people with Alzheime r's and dementia Supporting the creation of dementia friendly communities that help people with Alzheimer's and dementia remain safe and as independent as possible within their community Each of these will be discussed in more detail. 6 Image source: Copyrighted image; used with permission from the Alzheimer's Association 245SLIDE 9: PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH TALKING POINTS: We will start with public health research. Public health plays an important role in both conducting research and translating the findings from such research into practice. 246SLIDE 10: Discussion Questions What is public health research? What does it mean to translate findings? TALKING POINTS: Ask: What is public health research? What does it mean to translate findings? Open responses. 247SLIDE 11: Public Health Research & Translation7 Public health research: generalizable knowledge to improve practice Translation : evidence-based practice Sources: o Published, peer-reviewed articles o Authoritative guidelines, recommendations o Surveillance systems TALKING POINTS: Public health research is conduct ed with the goal of developing or contributing to generalizable knowledge to improve public health practice. \"Generalizable\" means that the information or knowledge that is gained may be widely applied to populations. Translating the information or knowledge gained through public health research means applying it in practice - such as through policy , the development of programs or interventions , or the development of best practices . When programs and policies are built on a framework of research findings they are referred to as being evidence-based . Sources for public health research and translation include: Published peer-reviewed articles Established best practices or guidelines from authoritative sources including government agencies (such as NIH, CDC, state health departments, state department of aging services), and nongovernmental organizations (such as the Alzheimer's Association) Surveillance systems such as the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 7 Image source: clker.com 248SLIDE 12: Discussion Question How can public health research and translation be used to reduce the burden of Alzheimer's disease?

Operators and drivers need to be aware of the special challenges faced by individuals with dementia, as well as how to recognize the signs that someone may need help. Customer service: Those in service positions may be trained to recognize when they are dealing with someone with possible Alzheimer's and dementia and how to best communicate with them and meet their needs. Faith or spiritual communities: These communities can be an important source of support and engagement for people with dementia, their families, and their caregivers. Church liaisons and volunteers may be trained to assist and support community members living with dementia. 20 Image source: Pedestrian and Bicycle Information Center, Dan Burden (Photographer) 272SLIDE 31: DEMENTIA FRIENDLY COMMUNITIES TALKING POINTS: Many of the issues discussed in this module tie into the concept of dementia friendly communities. This is growing movement in which communities in the U.S. and around the world are intentionally making changes t o ensure that their communities are not only safe for and accessible to people with Alzh eimer's and dementia , but also that they can support and empower people with Alzheimer's and dementia to continue living high-quality lives with as much independence as possible. 273SLIDE 32: Discussion Questions Imagine you or someone you care about has Alzheimer's or dementia.

The effort to become dementia friendly is made on a community-wide basis and requires planning and participation from all sectors as well as the general public. While overlap exists between the concepts of dementia capable (discussed previously) and dementia friendly, a dementia-friendly community encompasses a broader goal of supporting a higher quality of life for people with dementia beyond simply meeting their physical and health needs. 21 U.S. Administration for Community Living/Administration on Aging.

(2015) Dementia Friendly, Dementia Capable, and Dementia Positive: Concepts to Prepare for the Future. Image source: Copyrighted image; used with permission from the Alzheimer's Association 275Elements of a dementia friendly community include: Access to quality health care and community services . While encompassing the same aspects of dementia capable systems, dementia friendly communities offer: o Resources and supports that are geographically , financially , and culturally available and accessible . o Support services and activities , such as education al sessions regarding symptoms, disease processes, self-care, and providing care, as well as support groups and dementia friendly social events that are readily available throughout the community. Ensure safety and accessibility : People c an live safely , with as much independence as possible. This concept includes public transportation , walkability for leisure and to complete daily tasks, minimizing confusion when moving from place to place, and ensuring safety . Mobility considerations may include: o Age-friendly pavements o Adequate signage o Safe pedestrian crossings o Trained safety personnel o Welcoming open spaces, including squares, parks, and playgrou nds Public education and workforce development : In these communities, residents, agencies, businesses, health care facilities, places of worship, and general service providers are learning about dementia through education and awareness efforts, and providing assistance to people with the condition and their caregivers as they go about their daily lives. Technology may also play a role in the creation of dementia-friendly communities: o Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) can help 276people navigate their community while still allowing family or caregivers to track their whereabouts. o Community registry: Law enforcement can also create a voluntary registry for individuals with dementia. The registry provides the name, home address, and contact information for family members or care partners should the individual with dementia need help or become involved with law enforcement. International community models differ slightly from those in the U.S. in that internationally, a more holistic approach is often taken, while in the U.S., communities lean more on a practical and structural approach, gradually ensuring all systems and services within the community are designed to support members living with dementia and their care partners . In the following slides, we will look at some examples of communities and organizations working to become dementia friendly. 277SLIDE 34: Dementia Friendly Communities23 Infographic of dementia friendly communities TALKING POINTS: ACT on Alzheimer' s is a state-wide collaboration in Minnesota. We will learn more about the organization a few slides later. Here is an infographic that illustrates ACT on Alzheimer's view on what a dementia-friendly community involves: Raising awareness about Alzheimer 's, transforming attitudes, and moving people to action Supporting family and friend caregivers by providing accessible information, resources, and in-person support Promoting meaningful participation in community life for everyone Including communities that experience inequities because of race, ethnicity, culture, language, sexual orientation, gender identity, mental illness, hearing/sensory differences, intellectual or physical abilities, and economic status 23 Image source: ACT on Alzheimer's\u00ae developed tools and resources. http://actonalz.org/ 278SLIDE 35: Dementia Friendly: Middleton, WI24,25 Business trainings trail/park Evaluation criteria TALKING POINTS: The Alzheimer's & Demen tia Alliance of Wisconsin (ADAW) started a pilot dementia friendly program in Middleton, Wisconsin, in January 2014. They brought together a group of citizens, bu siness members, and city staff to launch the program, where they developed guidelines for businesses and organization to meet in order to be designated \"dementia friendly\": Complete DFC training for management and 50% of their front-line employees Designate a team leader to be liaison between their organization and the DFC task force Be open to discussions regarding environment changes (e.g. lighting, signage, layout, etc.) Be willing to share DFC training materials with any ne w hires and all employees that did not attend training Undergo an on-site visit/follow-up training on an annual basis to recertify its dementia friendly status 24 Wisconsin Department of Health Services.

All city management departments are involved in the effort, including first responders. Middleton's local library, one establishment that has taken the steps to become designated dementia friendly, offers dementia-focused community programs such as a Music and Memory class. The local Walgreens also earned the dementia-friendly label and has improved signage throughout their stores as well as trained their employees on how to interact successfully with their customers with dementia. Banks, restaurants, local shops, and groceries are also trained. ADAW is looking forward to expanding their dementia friendly training to personal service providers, such as beauticians and barbers, and even dentists. They are now working with other communities in Wisconsin to support them as they become dementia friendly.

The goal is to create a community that raises awareness about Alzheimer's, transforms attitudes, and moves people to action ; supports family and friend caregivers by providing accessible information, resources, and in-person support ; promotes meaningful participation in community life for everyone; and includes communities that experience inequities because of race, ethnicity, culture, language, sexual orientation, gender identity, mental illness, hearing/sensory differences, intellectual or physical abilities, and economic status . Currently, 35 communities across the state participate in the initiative. The process follows four action phases: Convene key community leaders and members to form an action team Assess strengths and gaps within the community related to dementia-friendly aspects Analyze community needs and develop action plans to respond 1. Launch action plans 26 ACT on Alzheimer's . (2013). Is Your Community Prepared?

States and communities play an active role in reducing the burden of the Alzheimer's and dementia epidemic. Two approaches are by creating dementia capable systems and dementia friendly communities . The concepts are similar and can overlap, but the focus of both is on accommodating those with dementia and their caregivers through providing support and services within their communities. Public health must take an active role in fostering dementia capable systems and dementia friendly communities through: Conducting public health research on the burden of Alzheimer's and dementia, and use findings to design effective programs, policies, and best practices Serving to provide, inform and connect individuals and caregivers to support services and programs Designing an d implementing workforce training to ensure workers across a wide range of professions are able to identify and meet the needs of people with Alzheimer's and dementia 29 Image source: Copyrighted image; used with permission from the Alzheimer's Association 287 Supporting the creation of dementia friendly communities that help people with Alzheimer' s and dementia remain safe and as independent as possible 288SLID E 40: For More Information For more information, please visit the Alzheimer's Association website at: http://www.alz.org TALKING POINTS: For more information on the topics covered in this presentation, please go to the Alzheimer's Association website at http://www.alz.org .

Audio/Transcript Link: http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=458041798 Run Time: 3:46 minutes (audio) Key Terms : cultural context, Native Americans, diagnosis, community outreach, family relationships, tradition, stigma, caregiver burden, long term care Module s: 1, 3, 4 Description: Mrs. Williams is an older woman who has been having severe memory problems for the past seven years. Mrs. Williams lived on a Native American reservation in Arizona before moving in with her daughter, Delma, in Los Angeles. In many tribal communities, an Alzheimer's diagnosis is rare; in fact, many tribal communities do not even have a word for dementia. Native American cultures typically consider aging and signs of Alzheimer's (memory issues, forgetfulness, getting lost) as part of the cycle of life: people begin life as children and leave as children. Mrs. Williams' daughter did not even know what Alzheimer's disease is because no one ever talked about it. Once in Los Angeles, Mrs. Williams' memory problems grew increasingly worse . Mrs. Williams began wandering and becoming lost. During moments of lucidity, Mrs. Williams begged her daughter to return her to her home on the reservation. Eventually Delma and her family moved back to the reservation. Mrs. Williams has thirteen other children who lived in that area, but Delma is the only one who cares for their mother. Delma is not sure why her siblings do not visit their mother and their absence upsets her. Delma also feels guilty for doubting her mother when she first mentioned having memory issues. 312Discussion Questions : Why is cultural respect important in public health? In this story, what are cultural barriers to diagno sing and understanding Alzheimer's disease? o Lack of word for dementia o Seen as a part of the lifecycle and natural o Stigma- no one talks about it and Mrs. Williams' other children do not visit How can public health address Alzheimer's disease misinformation and stigma in a culturally sensitive and relevant way? What is the role of family and care in an Alzheimer's disease diagnosis? What would components may be useful in creating a community outreach program for this community? 2- \"When Mom has Alzheimer's : A Stranger Comes for Christmas, \" NPR (2015). Audio/Transcript Link : http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=460042950 Run Time: 2:44 minutes (audio) Key Terms: caregiver burden, family, long term care, social stigma Module s: 1, 3 Description: Helen was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease seven years ago and now lives with her son, Terry, and his wife, Mary. Terry and Mary have created a structured routine for Helen that involves time at the adult day care center that provides socialization with other older adults, engaging activities, and day care. This routine has become an important part of maintaining Helen's health and wellness. The winter holidays are coming up, and Terry and Mary must strategize about how to celebrate with family and friends without disrupting Helen's routine. The winter holidays are addition ally stressful to families caring for members with Alzheimer's disease and can make caretakers feel overwhelmed. Terry and Mary must prepare visiting relatives for Helen's worsening condition. They also must mentally prepare themselves for the disappointment of fewer and fewer friends visiting to celebrate the holidays. Terry and Mary are exhausted all the time and say that they are just trying to get through Christmas now. As Helen's Alzheimer's disease progresses, Terry and Mary have come to accept that their lives are very different than from seven years ago when Helen moved in, and they continue to make personal sac rifices in order to take the best possible care of Helen. For example, Terry and Mary can no longer go to all of their friends' and family's various holid ay celebrations anymore, and often friends and family don't understand why. Terry and Mary have accepted they can no longer do everything they once did during the holidays ; however, they still feel the sense of missing out and being excluded. 313Discussion Questions : What are ways that extended family and friends could be more inclusive and understanding of this couples' difficult situation? o Be open with family about the situation and Helen's health o Emailing/calling relatives ahead of time to brief them on What to expect from Helen How best to support Helen o Smaller gatherings can make things easier for caregivers as well as Helen Noisy events and big groups can be overwhelming Prepare Helen by discussing the holidays ahead of time and looking at photos of family members o Having a quiet room when Helen can rest during the event How can public health reduce social stigma surrounding Alzheimer's disease?

What kind of modifications can be made in the home to increase safety and independence for the individual with Alzheimer's disease? o Open shelves so it's easier to find things o Take the knobs off the stove to prevent accidents 3- \"Inside Al zheimer's: What's it like to live with early -onset Alzheimer's disease? Greg O'Brien offers a glimpse,\" (2015). Audio/Transcript Link: http://www.npr.org/series/389781574/inside-alzheimers Run Time: 4-6 minutes per segment (audio) Key Terms : progression, younger-(early) onset, cancer, long term care, end of life decisions, caregiver burden, spouse/partner relationship, family relationship, loss of appetite, loss of smell, loss of taste, hallucinations, medications, GPS app, loss of identity Modules: 1, 2, 4 Description: A nin e part series of artic les and audio clips that chronicle aspects of one man's journey with Alzheimer's disease; aud io clips are 4-6 minutes each. Writer Greg O'Brien was diagnosed with younger- onset Alzheimer's disease six years ago when he was 59 years old. Not only was he diagnosed with younger- onset Alzheimer's disease, but he was also diagnosed with stage-three prostate cancer a few years later. Greg is a journalist and writer living in Cape Cod with his wife, Mary Catherine, and their three children. Greg began demonstrating signs of Alzheimer's disease, such as memory loss and getting lost as his own mother was in the end stages of Alzheimer's. Mary Catherine says that Alzheimer's disease changed Greg's personality in many ways. On one hand, Greg discusses certain topics with her more openly than he would have in the past, but 314she also has noticed that he gets angry now, something he never used to do before. In the past, Greg was a loud, outgoing man who was often was at the center of discussion. Now he is quieter and more solitary, even disappearing into a different room when crowds of visitors become overwhelming for him. Greg also used to run upwards of six miles daily as a part of his daily routine; however, he began getting lost and switched to running in a gym. Greg's personality is not the only thing that has changed since his younger- onset Alzheimer's diagnosis. Greg's appetite and sense of taste and smell have declined. Greg says that food now often tastes the same, like \"rolled up newspaper.\" Greg does buy fruit bars and states that although they have no taste, they do feel cold, which is a different and enjoyable sensation. As Greg's Alzheimer's disease has progressed over the past six years, so have his hallucinations. Hallucinations are a rarely discussed aspect of Alzheimer's disease but can often accompany memory loss. According to Greg's doctor s, these hallucinations are due to the changes in his brain as a result of the disease. . Mary Catherine and Greg's outlook on life has also changed over time. For example, Mary Catherine says that she no longer can get impatient, which is difficult, but important. In the beginning of his diagnosis, Greg used to get very angry, but now he no longer does as he tries to focus in the moment instead of the past or future. Mary Catherine believes their marriage has gotten even stronger as they navigate Greg's Alzheimer's disease. Because of Greg's Alzheimer's, Greg and Mary Catherine have had to make many difficult decisions, including deciding to sell their house that Greg built, where they raised their three children and planned to grow old together. Growing old in that house together is no longer a realistic possibility, due to Greg's Alzheimer's disease. Greg, Mary Catherine, and h is physician have discussed \"exit strategies\" for Greg while he is still aware and able to make these types of decisions. One of these exit strategies includes not treating his stage three prostate cancer. Greg's physician says that not treating the prosta te cancer will most lik ely shorten his life, but Greg is okay with this because he would rather his life be shortened by the prostate cancer than by the Alzheimer's disease. Greg states that he is most afraid of the \"in -between;\" he loves living and he is not afraid to die, but he fears the middle portion, the loss of identity and independence, and dreads his family's suffering as they watch his slow decline. Discussion Questions: Why is it important that individuals with Alzheimer's disease are diagnosed early? o When individuals are exhibiting signs of Alzheimer's disease, the people around them need to understand what is happening so they can be patient and react in an understanding way. o Being able to make important decisions about their care, including at the end of life, and finances while they are still able to make informed decisions. What are ways that Greg can maintain his independence as his Alzheimer's disease progresses? 315o Going to the gym worries his family in case he gets lost on the way. A GPS app on his phone can alert his family to his location. Discuss the importance of end of life planning and role of public health in encouraging people to make plans. Discuss the importance of a strong social network and family support. o In one of the interviews, Greg talks about how where he lives is a small town where everyone knows everyone and their business. As word of his Alzheimer's disease spread and more people in his town knew about it, people eventually began introducing themselves to him when they began a conversation in order to help him identify them. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of deciding not to treat stage-three prostate cancer as Alzheimer's disease progresses. 4- \"Can Technology Ease the Burden of Caring for People with Demen tia?\" NPR (2015). Audio/T ranscript Link : 4:35 minutes (audio) Key Terms: care givers burden, financial burden, healthcare system, family support, technology, monitoring systems, long term care Module s: 1, 2, 3, 4 Description: Aurora is 78 years old and lives with her husband , Arturo, in a small apartment in San Rafael. Aurora's daughter, M aria, comes by their apartment almost daily to help her mother bathe, grocery shop, do laundry, provide medical care, and do many other things around the house to help her father and care for her mother. Early in her Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, Aurora began wandering at night. Afraid that she might wander into the street, Arturo, began sleeping on the floor in front of the bedroom door in order to keep Aurora from leaving the apartment. Maria had the idea of attaching wind chimes to the door so that Arturo can hear when the door is opened and closed. Maria and Arturo are currently able to provide all the necessary care for Aurora to live safely in her own home. However, caring for patients with Al zheimer's disease is mentally and financially exhausting. As Aurora's Alzheimer's disease progresses, her safety in the apartment becomes an increasing concern. The story discusses ways that technology such as remote sensor monitoring systems can help people with dementia stay independent longer while giving caregivers a way to monitor activity and safety. 316Discussion Questions : What are some technologies available to help monitor the health of people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease? o Temperature sensor on stoves, Bluetooth blood sugar meters , sensor monitoring systems What are ethical dilemmas about these kinds of technologies that may be considered invasive of an individual's privacy and health? o These types of technologies could perhaps prolong independence and delay entering care facilities by allowing for close, consistent, and constant health and safety monitorin g o Allows for peace of mind for family members who may not be able to visit daily o Sensor Monitoring Systems- http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/25/tech/innovation/alzheimers-smart-home/ allows caregivers to keep a close watch on their loved ones with Alzheimer's disease through monitoring systems in the house that send notifications to the caregiver's smartphone o Some people with Alzheimer's disease say they feel better and safer knowing their family members are able to interact with them and monitor their safety even though they may live far away What are other ideas for technology that will allow for increased safety and prolonged independence of older adults with Alzheimer's disease ? What is the role of public health with assistive technologies? o Possible roles: safety reviews and regulation, consumer education, policy development on ways to help make technology affordable for low-income families, addressing ethical challenges 5- \"Alzheime r's Long and Costly Goodbye -Heartache and Hope: America's Alzheimer's Epidemic (Episode 1), \" University of California Television (2012). Video Link: http://myuctv.tv/2012/09/18/alzheimers-the-long-and-costly-goodbye/ Run Time: 12:30 minute s Key Terms: stigma, loss of identity, increasing prevalence, increasing aging population, caregiver's burden, family relationships, financial burden Module s: 1, 2, 3, 4 Description: This documentary discusses how Alzheimer's disease affects the lives of individuals and families, touching on concepts from daily tasks becoming difficult or impossible, to the loss of self-identity that occurs. Often receiving an Alzheimer's diagnosis creates an emotional, physical, and financial impact on not only the individual diagnosed, but also family members and friends. This documentary also describes the economic impact of Alzheimer's in the US and on the health care system, as well as its increasing prevalence as the aging population 317continues to increase around the globe. This documentary provides multiple real-life Alzheimer's examples , such as President Rea gan's diagnosis and decline through an interview with his daughter, and Leeza Gibbon's struggle with caring for her mother who lived with Alzheimer's disease for 10 years. E xperts also discuss Alzheimer's financial burden on individuals, families, and the US economy, as well as other countries. This documentary briefly mentions the National Plan to Ad dress Alzheimer's Disease. Case Study: Patti Patti graduated as the valedictorian of her high school and a few years later, she graduated magna cum laude from Syracuse University. Patti was a successful professor at a university for many decades. A few years ago, Patti began having difficulty remembering how to do simple daily tasks, such as making coffee, and she was constantly losing her glasses, her phone, or other items. Patti never told anyone about her memory issues because she thought it was embarrassing to admit that she was getting older. However, recently, Patti was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Now, Patti describes the difficulty of doing simple tasks as if a voice in her head is constantly challenging her, saying, \"How do you do that?\" Now, daily activities leave Patti lost and confused. Patti often finds herself turning around in circles as she tries to remember or figure out how to do. Patti planned on leaving an inheritance for her son when she passed away. Patti has a reverse mortgage, which is a special type of home loan for older adults that allows them to convert a portion of the equity of the home into cash. Older adults often use the cash payments to supplement income from Social Security, for unexpected medical expenses, home improvements, and many other uses . Alzheimer's disea se is a costly disease. Patti now worries that she will no longer be able to leave an inheritance for her son because she could be drained of all her finances to cover her care needs . Discussion Questions: Consider the costs that are associated with medical care and long-term services for people with dementia. What kinds of financial protections are in place to protect older adults' finances who live on a fixed income? What are other countries doing to provide quality and affordable medical care to their older adults? How does financial planning play a role in preparing for aging, potential onset of illnesses or disability, and the associated costs of care? 6- \"Caregivers, \" HBO (n.d.) . Video Link: http://www.hbo.com/alzheimers/caregivers.html Run Time: 48:48 minutes (each segment is approximately 10 mins) Key Terms: stigma, caregiver relationship, life after caregiving, duties and responsibility, assisted living facilities Module s: 1, 3, 4 318Description : This documentary shares the stories of five caregivers and demonstrates the struggle and resilience of the caregiver when a family member is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. These caregivers struggle to balance their own lives and responsibilities with the daily duties and responsibilities of caring for a love d one with Alzheimer's disease. This documentary illustrates the many challenges and sacrifices, such as personal responsibilities as well as social stigma that caregivers go through in order to care for their loved ones in the family home as well as in nursing care facilities. Case Studies : (stories presented in progressing order of Alzheimer's disease stages) Chuc k (and Mari anne) (Minute: 2:40-13:10) - Social support network Chuck was diagnose d with younger- onset Alzheimer's disease in 2004. Chuck's mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease the fall he began high school. Younger- onset Alzheimer's disease is caused by a rare genetic mutation (it accounts for less than 3% of Alzheimer's disease cases) and is passed down through families. 12 out of 14 of Chuck's older relatives have died from Alzheimer's disease. Marianne is Chuck's ex -wife. After Chuck's diagnosis, Marianne invited Chuck back and became his primary caregiver. As the caregiver, it is important for Marianne to maintain some time and space for herself. That space allows for her to relax and gives her a break from caregiving for a short amount of time. Chuck takes many different kinds of medications in order to control the progression of his Al zheimer's disease. Chuck and Marianne have made new friends with a couple where one partner also has Alzheimer's disease. Chuck and Marianne really enjoy the support and understanding that comes from this other couple in a similar situation. Chuck stays in the moment. He must make an effort to be positive and accept the changes as they come. Discussion Question: Discuss the importance of a supportive social network. What are the challenges in finding support such as social isolation and stigma? Daphne (and Jude) (minute: 13:10-21:25) - Caregiver support Daphne is 65 years old and lives with her partner, Jude; they have been together for 24 years and Jude has been Daphne's caregiver for the past six years. Daphne used to be an astrophysicist, but she has lost her ability to remember, compute, and use simple and complicated numbers. She also used to love cooking, but since her Alzheimer's diagnosis, she struggles with measuring ingredients. Instead, Daphne turned to art, using painting as an outlet for her expressions. Painting has become Daphne's second language, and she hopes that her artwork will speak for her once she loses her ability to speak. Jude regularly attends an Alzheimer's Association support group for caregivers of people diagnosed wit h Alzheimer's disease. This group provides Jude and other caregivers like her with unconditional emotional support; this group also discusses the importance of taking a little time to oneself. Jude attends this support group as well as a singing group at her church. Jude 319reflects on how she still gets something from her time with Daphne, despite what the disease has taken. Discussion Questions: Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's disease can p ut tremendous stress and burden on the caregiver. What are ways to ease this burden? How can communities provide resources and safe spaces for people with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers? Nacho (and Mike) (minute: 21:25-30:40) - F ull-time care Mike has six brothers and sisters and runs his own business; he is also the primary caregiver for his father, Nacho, who has Alzheimer's disease. Mike is the primary caregiver for his father because he had extra space in his house. A year and half into Nac ho living with Mike, Mike's girlfriend moved out due to the enormous amount of stress that caring for Nacho put on their relationship. Mike feels similar stress in his other relationships with family and friends. There are many ups and downs that come with taking care of Nacho. Mike and the adult day center where Nacho spends days adjust games in small ways that allow Nacho to win. It is important to help Nacho retain self- worth as his Alzheimer's becomes increasingly degenerative. Without self-worth, depression overtakes Nacho. Sometimes Mike feels as if he can provide in-home primary care for his father for months, years, even decades, but then his father has another Alzheimer's disease -related issue bringing back the reality of Alzheimer's disease. At first, Mike took his father everywhere he went. A s Nacho's Alzheimer's progresse d, outings became more than Mike and Nacho could handle. Now, Nacho does not like crowds or noise. Mike declines outings now to stay home and care for Nacho. Since beginning to stay home more with Nacho two years ago, Mike has gained thirty pounds and now has high blood pressure. Recently, Mike moved Nacho to a facility that provides 24-hour care. Moving was very hard on Nacho, especially the first few months as his Alzheimer's d isease worsened. At the facility, Nacho often wakes up in the middle of the night and does not know where the bathroom is, so he urinates in the kitchen or living room because he does not know his surroundings. Because Nacho no longer sleeps through the night, Mike has had to hire someone to provide nighttime care for Nacho and make sure he is safe and does not disrupt the other residents; a nighttime caregiver is expensive. Even though Mike no longer sees Nacho every day, he still takes each day one at a time. Discuss ion Questions: With Mike's caregiving responsibility, what were some of the impacts this role had on Mike's life and health? The transition to a full-time nursing facility is often difficult on bot h the person with Alzheimer's disease and their family. This move can be even more difficult depending on 320the stage of Alzheimer's disease. What are some ways to make this transition easier for the person and their family? What are some safety measures that nursing facilities need to provide care and a safe space for Nacho an d others with Alzheimer's ? Marvine (and Jackie) (minute: 30:40-39:10) - Full-time care When they wer e first married, Marvine and Jackie vowed to never put each other in nursing homes. Eventually, Marvine was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and Jackie began having health issu es. Jackie felt like she did not have a choice about moving Marvine to a nursing home and this was a very difficult decision for her. Marvine has been living in the nursing home for a few years now and Jackie visits him often. Jackie tends to dress very nicely and carefully when she visits her husband because on the days he does remember her, this makes him very happy. While visiting her husband, she feeds him because this is one of the few ways that she can provide care for him. Marvine is in the severe stages of Alzheimer's disease. H is ability to communicate verbally has been severally limited and often does not recognize people who speak to him. It is emotionally very difficult for Marvine's children, family, and friends to visit him in the nursing home. Marvine is no longer the full- of-life man whom everyone remembers. Jackie makes it a point to never say goodbye while at the nursing home. Discussi on Questions: What types of information or professional services could help families know when it is time to move someone with Alzheimer's disease into a full -time care facility? The severe stages of Alzheimer's disease are incredibly difficult for friends and family members. What resources are available to help them through this difficult time? What impact does Alzheimer's disease have on relationships? Pat (an d Terry and Suzanne) (minute: 39:10- 45:55) - L ife after Alzheimer's Pat and Te rry were married for 34 years. Seventeen years into their marriage, Pat and Terry began having problems. One evening, Pat said that she felt something was wrong with her and began to cry . Pat never cried. As it turned out, Pat had Alzheimer's disease. Terry cared for Pat for the rest of her life. Terry remembers that taking care of Pat was lonely and difficult, but he took care of her for as long as he could because he loved her. While caring for Pat, Terry struggled with the increasing social isolation that comes from caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's disease. After nine years of caring for her at home, Terry moved Pat into a full-time care center. This was very emotional and difficult for Terry. At first, he continued to take as much care of Pat as he could, but as her Alzheimer's disease progressed, he realized he could not provide enough care for her anymore. Once Pat passed away, Terry realized he did not want to go back to the life he had before caregiving. He was not sure what to do with his life going forward. 321When Terry met Suzanne on a cruise in Alaska, he realized there is a life after caregiving. They eventually married and began volunteering at a family center for people with Alzheimer's disease. They enjoy giving back to the community, and this work has given Terry a renewed sense of pur pose. The center and Suzanne have given Terry a second chance at a fulfilling life. Discussi on Questions: What are some of the social impact s that Alzheimer's caregivers can experience? What are ways communities can help people transition from caregiving to life after caregiving? 7- \"The M emory Loss Tapes, \" HBO (n.d.) . Video Link : http://www.hbo.com/alzheimers/memory-loss-tapes.html Discussion Guide: http://www.hbo.com/alzheimers/downloads/Memory_Loss.com.pdf Run Time: 85 minutes (each segment is approximately 8-12 minutes) Key Terms : family relationship, caregiver relationship, Alzheimer's medications, individual acceptance, family acceptance, assisted living facilities, end of life planning Module s: 1, 3, 4 Description : \"The Memory Loss Tapes \" are part of a four-part HBO documentary series entitled The Alzheimer's Project . This documentary gives a short glimpse into the lives of seven individuals in varying stages of Alzheimer's disease. Each of the profiles gives insight into the lives of those living with the diagnosis, their surrounding family members and caregivers, and their reactions to the diagnosis. Central themes in this documentary include loss of independence, confusion, fear and anxiety, and the importance of support and community resources. Case Stud ies: Bessie (0:00-12:08) - Living independently for as long as possible Bessie is an 87 year old woman who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease two months ago. Bessie is in the mild (early) stages of Alzheimer's disease , and she is still very independent, able to drive and live alone . Bessie is active in her community. Everyone in town knows Bessie and she is well loved. Bessie volunteers with other women to sing in nursing homes. When Bessie can't remember who people are, they remind her, but a few minutes later, she forgets who they are again. Bessie's friends have noticed her Alzheimer's disease and they worry about her. Bessie's daughter and son -in-law want her to take medications that may slow the progression of her Alzheimer's disease. Bessie has a positive perspective on life and does not believe in giving up. Her daughter attributes this positive attitude towards how well Bessie is doing. Bessie is still very intelligent and alert, but she knows she has Alzheimer's disease which is causing her memory issues. Bessie's children worry about how they will care for her as her Alzheimer' s disease progresses, when she begins forgetting she has Alzheimer's disease or no longer understands what Alzheimer's disease means. 322Discussion Questions: What are ways that Bessie's family prolong her independence? Discuss the importance of a supportive social network. Frannie (12:09- 19:34) - Driving issues Frannie is an 82 year old woman who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease three months ago. Two months ago, Frannie's doctor told her she should stop driving. Frannie feel s inadequate and dislikes depending on other people when she has been taking care of herself. Franni e's daughter took her to have a driving assessment test to see if Frannie is able to drive. Even though she is in the mild (early) stages of Alzheimer's dise ase, her judgment may already be affected and is causing driving safety issues. This driving assessment is comp rised of three parts: one part is a self-assessment of driving skills, one part is identifying road signs, and the third part is the driving test. Frannie struggled with identifying road signs as well as remembering traffic laws; she had a lot of difficulty during the driving portion with reading the road signs, staying in her lane, and following verbal directions. The test assessment results s upport the doctor's recommendations that Frannie should no longer drive. Frannie's daughter tells her that she and her siblings are happy to drive Frannie anywhere she wants to go. They already pick her up every Sunday on the way to church. While Frannie admits that she does not need to drive every day, losing the ability to drive is more about losing her independence and freedom. Frannie is very disappointed in this decision. Discussi on Questions: What are barriers to independence when diagnosed with Alzh eimer's disease? How can we, as a society and community, promote older adult independence and feelings of adequacy and self-worth while maintaining safety? Consider how difficult it would be to live without a car or to use buses and subways while deal ing with Alzheimer's disease. What changes in city design or what types of services would help support independence for all older adults? For older adults with Alzheimer's disease? Joe (19 :38-31:13) - End of life planning Joe is 63 years ol d and was diag nosed with Alzheimer's disease two years ago. Joe found his passion in the 1980s working in the technology industry. He helped develop CDs and DVDs. Now, Joe writes a blog about his Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and living with the disease. Joe chronicles the struggles of his progressing Alzheimer's disease, such as getting locked out of his house, forgetting how to get back in his house, and being afraid to leave home in case he gets lost and cannot get back. For example, one day Joe took his granddaughter to play at the park. He forgot how to get home and could not remember where he was. Fortunately, his 323granddaughter knew how to get home, and they returned safely. This is just one example of Joe getting lost and endangering his and others' safety. Joe st ruggles with his Alzheimer's diagnosis emotionally and physically. Sometimes, Joe is so overwhelmed with forgetting peoples' faces that he no longer wants to interact with anyone. Joe also knows that he is getting worse over time and worries about \"steppin g over the line\" and becoming a completely different person. He attends counseling to help with this anxiety and the emotional toll of Alzheimer's disease. Joe has begun end -of-life planning and is determined not to lose himself in the disease. Joe tries to reconcile his existence and meaning within the context of the universe, but finds it very difficult. It upsets his family when he talks about dying. Discussion Questions: What are benefits of end- of-life planning? What are barriers to end- of-life planning? In what ways can end- of-life planning promoted ? Yoland a (31:14- 39:24) - Hallucinations Yolanda is 75 yea rs old and lives in a nursing home. S he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease six years ago. Yolanda is in the later stages of Alzheimer's disease and cannot do anything for herself anymore. Yolanda often has hallucinations. Yolanda believes that her good friend Ruth lives in her mirror, and she sees animals such as spiders and snakes in her room. Her nursing home has many daily activities that residents can engage in to promote socialization, including arts and c rafts and a beauty salon. Yolanda no longer remembers her son when he comes to visit. It is emotionally difficult to not be recognized by his own mother. Discuss ion Question: What measures are in place for peoples' wellbeing in nursing homes? (Next segment picks up at min 39:43, starts at 00:00 min) Woody (00:00-14:21) - Music and Memory Woody is an 81 year old man who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease 14 years ago. Woody has always loved singing, and this passion has remained with him throughout his Alzheimer's progression. Woody now lives in a nursing home, but his family takes him to sing with his old singing group often. During the trip out, Woody asks the same questions over and over and does not know what is happening. However, while performing, Woody can still sing all the words. Woody, who has been married for many years, does not remember that he is married but recognizes his wife and daughter when they come to visit. In the nursing home, he has female admirers. The film shows Woody spending time with a female resident who is very affectionate; they hold hands, kiss and take a nap with one another. 324Discussion Questions : Woody enjoyed singing and still remembers the words to many songs despite his Alzheimer's disease progression. How can using a person's talents enhance quality of life? How does Alzheimer's change the nature of martial relationships, especially when the person with dementia does not remember their spouse ? Josephine (12:21- 23:26) - The Fence Josephine is a 77 year old woman who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease five years ago. After Josephine's diagnosis, her daughter moved from her job and life in the city to a farm where Josephine lives with her. Josephine's daughter locks the farm gates and constantly worries about Josephine getting lost on the farm. Fortunately, Josephine's daughter was able to put up a fence around the farm, which has helped her to keep track of Josephine. Josephine's daughter must constant ly watch on her mother for her safety and make sure she does not get into trouble. For example, Josephine often puts things in her mouth that must be removed despite Josephine's protests. Josephine's daughter does not know how much longer she will be able to care for her mother at home on the farm. Josephine no longer speaks, but does communicate a little through sounds such as humming. Josephine also leaves small art arrangements using small objects around the house that her daughter documents with photographs. These vignettes tell her daughter that Josephine is still there beneath her progressing Alzheimer's disease. Josephine also paints on both canvases and rocks. Unfortunately, Josephine paints white over many of her canvas paintings and these no longer exist. Discuss ion Questions: What could be some special challenges for people in rural areas who are living with or caring for someone affected by Alzheimer's ? How can we improve the home to ensure the safety and health of older adults with Alzheimer's disease? What resources are available to caregivers? Cliff (23:27-41:21) - Final Stages Cliff is 79 ye ars old and used to perform as a magician on a children's television show . He was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease six years ago. Cliff spends a lot of his time resting in bed or sitting down and cannot get out of bed by himself. Cliff believes he needs to get out of bed and go somewhere, often to his television show, and often continually tries to get out of the bed. Cliff lives with his wife and also has a homecare nurse who assists with caregiving. Cliff is in the severe stages of Alzheimer's disease. Cliff's wife cooks his favorite foods, which are not healthy, but if it gets him to eat, she will still make anything for him. Earlier in his diagnosis, Cliff planned with his wife not to prolong his life with artificial measures. 325Cliff has tried medications to ease the symptoms of Alzheimer's. However, Cliff's disease has progressed enough that these medications no longer help . Cliff's doctor asked his wife about her wishes for Cliff. Cliff's wife wishes to prolong his life, but since he is no longer himself, she does not think it is fair to continue his life with medications, especially because this is not the life he wanted for himself. Discussion Questions: Why is end- of-life planning uncommon? What are barriers to end- of-life planning? How can we support caregivers after caregiving? 326Alzheimer's Disease Video Resources The following videos are listed as suggested accompaniments to the curriculum modules.
