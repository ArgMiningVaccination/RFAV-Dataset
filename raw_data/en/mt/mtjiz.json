This review found strong evidence that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is not associated with autism, which is consistent with previous reviews of this rumored link. This new study also found no link between childhood leukemia and vaccines for MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) or DTap ( diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis), tetanus, influenza and hepatitis B. The study was ran by Courtney Gidengil M.D. who is a natural scientist at the RAND Corporation and board certified in both general pediatrics and pediatric infectious diseases. She practices at Hasbro Children's Hospital and Brown University, Boston Children's Hospital, and Harvard Medical School. She joined the division as faculty in 2009 and her research training includes the Harvard Pediatric Health Services Research Fellowship Program. How the Rumor About the MMR Vaccine Started... In 1998, Dr. Andrew Wakefield and 12 of his colleagues published a case series in the Lancet, which suggested that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine may predispose to behavioral regression and pervasive developmental disorder in children. Despite the small sample size the uncontrolled design, and the speculative nature of the conclusions, the paper received wide publicity, and MMR vaccination rates began to drop because parents were concerned about the risk of autism after vaccination. It was later reported that the study's author, Dr. Andrew Wakefield , had altered some of the study's results. Some parents have chosen not to have their children vaccinated because of this now debunked and retracted study. Clearing Up the Misinformation For Providers and Patients Recent medical school graduates have been skeptical of the safety and effectiveness of vaccines than did older graduates. It's hopeful that new studies like these will change opinions of vaccinations. It's also easier sometimes for order doctors to believe in using vaccines after they have seen the devastating infections in patients that were totally preventable only if parents would have permitted the vaccination. If More Parents Choose Not to Vaccinate Their Children There Will Be More Outbreaks of Preventable Diseases A review of 18 measles studies and 32 pertussis studies published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that parents who intentionally do not have their children vaccinated contribute to disease outbreaks. The largest measles outbreak in recent U.S. History happened in Houston, Texas in 1989-1990 where 1,000 cases of measles were found in children. People died because they didn't have the vaccine. It was all preventable! The United States is a safe environment in most cases for diseases these days and it's easy to forget what it was like before vaccines. It's Extremely Important For Children In School To be Vaccinated Because of the close interaction between children at school and in daycare, it's extremely important to defend your children from disease and it's extremely important not to have child who can spread the disease to other.
