The virus is thought to spread mainly from person to person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. While anyone can potentially contract coronavirus, people with chronic conditions or compromised immune systems and older individuals are at greater risk from potentially serious health complications. Chronic conditions may include lung disease, diabetes, heart disease, and more. Be sure to stay informed with the latest updates from the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html).

Already received the COVID-19 Vaccine? If you are a Changebridge patient, please [click here](/contact/) and send us the date(s) and type of vaccine so we can update your medical record and remove your name from our vaccine outreach list. This will help us focus our efforts on those who still want the vaccine but haven't received it. How to Report Vaccine Side Effects: Consider signing up for v-safe and reporting any symptoms after immunization. V-safe is a smartphone-based tool that checks in on you after your COVID-19 vaccination. Your participation helps keep COVID-19 vaccines safe \u2014 for you and for everyone. This information will not go to your PCP but to the CDC. The website to register is: [https://vsafe.cdc.gov/en/](https://vsafe.cdc.gov/en/) J&J (Janssen) Vaccine: Following a recent pause to investigate rare reports of blood clots, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and CDC recommend vaccination with the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine resume among people 18 years and older. However, women younger than 50 years old especially should be aware of the rare but increased risk of thrombosis (blood clots) with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). Does This News About the J&J Vaccine Apply to the Moderna and Pfizer Vaccines? The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines (mRNA vaccines) are completely different in how they are made and how they work from the J&J vaccine and have not been found to cause blood clots. There are several manufacturers developing COVID-19 vaccines. As of this writing, Pfizer, Moderna, and Janssen have received emergency approval from the FDA for their vaccines. The Pfizer vaccine requires special refrigeration and must be stored at sub-arctic temperatures. The Moderna vaccine may be stored at regular freezer temperatures and Janssen can be stored at refrigerator temperatures The Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are given in two doses. The Pfizer vaccine is given 21 days apart, Moderna vaccine is given 28 days apart, and the Janssen vaccine is given once. Americans will be vaccinated in a phased schedule based on risk, with a timeline that likely extends into the late spring of 2021. Currently all people living, working, or studying in New Jersey are able to receive an age-appropriate vaccine. The vaccine will help us to reach herd immunity when enough people are vaccinated. Until that time, our best defense is to continue to wear masks, maintain your social distance, and do not gather in large groups. Even when you do get the vaccine, it is important to take these precautions to protect those around you. There will be several different COVID-19 vaccines released in 2021 and they will be allocated to hospitals, health centers, pharmacies, vaccine clinics, and primary care practices. Changebridge has been approved as a vaccination site. As your primary care provider, our goal is to help you get protected against COVID-19 as soon as possible. As an established Changebridge patient, you will have the benefit of convenient registration and scheduling and knowing that an experienced team is giving you your vaccine. As always, we are taking great care, with protocols that are safe, even for our highest-risk patients. Changebridge is currently offering 2 vaccines. Changebridge is able to offer a COVID-19 vaccine to all eligible patients who live, work, or study in New Jersey and meet the age requirement. Potential side effects of the coronavirus vaccine At Changebridge Medical Associates, safety is our number one concern. We are continuously evaluating the FDA data so we can be confident that we are administering a safe vaccine. Allergic reactions have been reported in a small number of people who have received the vaccine. We have worked with our allergist, pharmacist, nurses, and providers to have necessary medicine and protocols in place should an emergency arise. To help ensure our patients are safe, we will ask you to park in the parking lot for 15 minutes after receiving your vaccination. Patients with a significant allergy history are going to receive their vaccinations inside and will be asked to wait for 30 minutes. If you answer \"yes\" to one or more of these questions, you should consider getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Importantly, every person is different. You may consider the vaccine for an elderly parent, for example, even if you feel it is not right for you.
