This energy is palpable as the days get brighter and the flora and fauna around us awaken from the quietude of winter. Our health and well-being are profoundly entwined with the cycles of nature. We are our healthiest when we are in deep harmony with these cycles, so as the season changes it is important to connect with nature and attune to what it is teaching us. In this time the seeds of change we have planted over the year will begin blossoming so prepare the garden of your mind and body with our spring wellness tips. The Liver and Gall Bladder Season Each season in Chinese medicine is associated with a pair of yin and yang organs. Spring is the time of the Liver (yin) and Gallbladder (yang), so in this transitional season, we must take care to support these organs and what they do for our bodies physically and energetically. The Liver and Gallbladder are responsible for the smooth flow of emotions. Stress and feelings like anger or resentment can create stagnation, which can then manifest as physical ailments. |Common symptoms of Liver/Gallbladder imbalance: ||Qualities of balanced Liver/Gallbladder: | Spring Wellness Tips Seasonal Acupuncture Tune-up The change of seasons is an ideal time for an [acupuncture tune-up](https://www.arogya.net/acupuncture). Acupuncture is an excellent way to help your body align with the seasonal changes, boost your immune system, and improve circulation, which all help to optimize your health and well-being during this time of transition. Liver and Gallbladder imbalance can be addressed, as well as any other health concerns you may have during the spring. The Color Green The color associated with spring in Chinese medicine is green. So green foods are a particularly potent medicine this time of year. Invest in [fresh greens of all kinds](https://blog.arogya.net/green-goodness-part-3-salad-greens/), a variety of sprouts, and incorporate lighter meals with lots of fresh salads. Sour flavors The sour taste is especially helpful this time of year, so squeeze lemon or lime juice in your water and make a [delicious lemon dressing](https://blog.arogya.net/lemon-garlic-dressing/) to add a zing to your salads and meals. Transition Calmly Just as nature slowly transitions into spring, we must take our time moving into the new lifestyle that spring inspires. Don't be too quick to pack up your winter clothes. It's important to keep warm and wear a lighter scarf on the cool and windy spring days to keep your immunity high. Connect with Nature As the days are warming, it's a great time to get outside! Go for walks in nature, observe the spring growth, clean up your yard, prepare your garden, and get in touch with the earth. Practice Forgiveness Forgiveness is a lifetime practice, and focusing on the art of forgiving in springtime reaps powerful results as it directly affects the liver Qi. A powerful practice to cultivate forgiveness is the ancient Hawaiian practice [Ho'oponopono](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/focus-forgiveness/201105/the-hawaiian-secret-forgiveness). This practice involves mentally repeating: \"I'm sorry, please forgive me, thank you, I love you\" while contemplating your relationships with others, and to yourself. By Chloe Bolton "}
