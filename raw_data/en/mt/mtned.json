We combine novel nanotechnology and cancer systems biology to develop next-generation combination immunotherapies for cancer. We aspire to substantially improve health care using our proprietary nanotechnology platform. It can co-deliver siRNA, chemo drugs, vaccines, and/or immunotherapies. We capitalize on this platform to generate next generation combination immune therapies for cancer by co-delivering therapeutics targeting complementary cancer and immune pathways, leading to synergistic clinical benefits. About Dr. Yantasee In addition to her position as Professor at OHSU, Dr. Yantasee is also a Research Member of the [Knight Cancer Institute](https://apps.ohsu.edu/health/knight-cancer/index.html) and a Nanomedicine Signature Researcher at [Oregon Nanoscience and Microtechnologies Institute (ONAMI)](http://www.onami.us/) News February 21, 2023 The Yantasee lab at OHSU in collaboration with PDX Pharmaceuticals has been awarded a phase II SBIR grant of $1.87M for 2 years from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) focusing on the development of a new nano-immunotherapy ARAC-02 (Antigen Release Agent and Checkpoint Inhibitor) for lung cancer treatment. ARAC-02 - and an immune-stimulant CpG - provides effective antitumor immune response via CD8+ T cell activities. The original grant application of ARAC-02 had high merit and received a rare perfect score from the NIH. We met all phase I SBIR milestones on formulation optimization and initial efficacy and safety studies in cells and in mice, which leads to phase II SBIR grant awarded for ARAC-02's evaluation in multiple lung cancer models. Many cancers including lung cancer depend on PLK1 for cell division and growth, and PLK1 inhibition by ARAC-02 will lead inhibition, ARAC-02 transiently upregulates PD-L1 expression, rendering the cancer (which may originally have low PD-L1 expression and are not eligible for immune checkpoint inhibitors, ICIs) more sensitive to PD-L1 antibody serving as the ICI and cancer homing agent on ARAC-02. We also show that CpG on ARAC-02, which recruits and activates antigen-presenting cells, enhance CD8+ T cell population and activities. Our current data suggest that ARAC-02 will have broad efficacy in lung and other cancer types (e.g., breast, liver, and pancreatic cancer) regardless of mutational status. ARAC-02 is anticipated to reach clinical trials next year. Data on ARAC (without CpG) was published in Nature Communications ( [view online](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31926-9)). A US patent (US11224573B2) on the ARAC technology was also issued in Jan, 2022. March 21, 2022 Data on T-siHER2-NP(DTX) featured as [a cover article](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smll.202270050) in Small (IF 13). Yantasee Lab in collaboration with PDX Pharmaceuticals and the Hynynen lab at Sunnybrook Research Institute, co-authored a cover article published in Small Journal, which describes our nano-therapeutic for treating advanced HER2+ breast cancer. The article describes how our nanoparticle platform (Pdx-NPTM) can load 3 different classes HER2 siRNA, docetaxel (chemotherapeutic) and trastuzumab (anti-HER2 antibody) and deliver them to a breast tumor at once. By co-delivering these therapeutics, T-siHER2-NP(DTX) can overcome resistance of HER2+ breast cancer to the first-line treatment regimen, while improving toxicity by specifically targeting HER2+ cells.

February 7, 2022 Three new US patents issued to Yantasee Lab in collaboration with PDX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. To date, the Yantasee lab have had a total of 38 patent applications, and 3 patents were issued in the past 3 months. All thanks to our dedicated team of researchers. - Patent No. 11,235,058, Immunotherapeutic constructs and methods of their use, February 1, 2022 - Patent No. 11,224,573, Therapeutic constructs for co-delivery of mitotic kinase inhibitor and immune checkpoint inhibitor, January 2022 - Patent No. 11,207,428, Cross-linked polymer modified nanoparticles, December 28, 2021 They are the joint inventions of OHSU and PDX Pharmaceuticals. Huge thanks to our research teams, Tanya Harding of Lee & Hayes (our patent attorney), and the NIH's NCI for sponsoring the research (R44CA217534, R44CA265751, and R44CA265752). The content is solely the responsibility of the inventors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health. October, 2021 Yantasee and team have received the USPTO's Notice of Allowance for two US patents including [US 16/999,948](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=IyUAI3oAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=IyUAI3oAAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC) titled \"Immunotherapeutic constructs and methods of their use\" \"Therapeutic constructs kinase inhibitor and immune checkpoint inhibitor\". The patent should be issued shortly. Both technologies are joint inventions of OHSU and her startup, PDX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. September, 2021 Yantasee Lab in collaboration with PDX Pharmaceuticals, Inc., has received a perfect score (10) on its fast track SBIR grant application to the NCI. The application focuses on development of PDX Pharma's ARACTM pipeline, a systemic nano-immunotherapy for tumor not accessible for local treatment or injection. Grant title: Novel Nano-immunotherapy for Treatment of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, and was awarded $2.26 M ($378K as phase I) over 3 years. Furthermore, the team scored very high (18) on its direct phase II SBIR grant application to the NCI. The application focuses on IND enabling studies of AIRISETM pipeline, an innovative, next generation immunotherapeutic.
