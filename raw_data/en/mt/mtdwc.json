FOREWORD by Professor Caroline Hunter Head of York Law School It gives me great pleasure to provide this Foreword to the second volume of the York Law Review. I do so in a time of uncertainty and change. Uncertainty because of COVID pandemic. \u0001is has clearly meant di\u0002erent ways of working and learning in the last 18 months. I want to congratulate the student editors in publishing this volume in such di\u0003cult circumstances. \u0001e team has been expanded this year , and no doubt that has helped, but it brings its own challenges as meetings are moved on-line and quick chats have to the scheduled. Beyond the editorial team, COVID has brought changes to University teaching and learning. For much of 2020\u009621 the Law School's teaching has been entirely on-line. One of the de\u00aening elements of York Law School is the use of problem-based learning (PBL) for all of our undergraduate core modules \u0097 the question posed by COVID was whether we could translate that form of learning into the virtual classroom. It is lovely to read Fraser King's article \u0097 \u0091It's Not All Zoom and Gloom: Re\u00afections of University Study during COVID-19\u0092 \u0097 re\u00afecting on his experience as both an LLM student and a graduate teaching assistant. \u0001e pandemic has brought huge legal changes both in the UK and across the world. In line with the Law School's research focus on socially engaged research, members of sta\u0002 at the School has been involved in di\u0002erent projects probing COVID and the e\u0002ects of the law for the public, particularly the vulnerable in our society. \u0001at will be published in the next few months. \u0001is volume came too early for our stu dents to write in their dissertations about the legal changes that COVID has brought. However, I look forward to dissertations on the topic this year and in future years and I hope some will \u00aend their way into the Review in future volumes. I am sure some will come from our LLM students, particularly from our students based in the Centre for Applied Human Rights (CAHR) taking the LLM in International Human Rights Law and Practice. I am very pleased that this volume includes more from our LLM students than the \u00aerst. \u0001e timing for our taught post -graduate dissertation did not allow for any to be included in that volume. \u0001is second volume has enabled a number of these to be showcased, including the empirical projects undertaken by students at CAHR. Another change this year is more personal. \u0001is is the last Foreword I will write as Head of School as my term of o\u0003ce ends in September. I know that the School is in great hands with my successor Professor TT Arvind. Over the eight years of my term of o\u0003ce the School has grown hugely. In 2013 we had 376 LLB and 16 LLM students, this undergraduate number has now more than doubled to 724 and the LLM numbers are \u00aeve times bigger at 70 students. Growth is challenging but it allows the School to invest in student projects like the Review. It also challenges us to consider how our values can be maintained. In the \u00aerst Foreword to the Review I commented that: \u0001e starting principle in our culture is that YLS is a learning community in which sta\u0002 and students are active participants. \u0001e Review is new venture that re\u00afects this culture: it is a collaboration between students and sta\u0002 and shows the active learning of our students particularly the research that goes into a dissertation. \u0001is volume continues to demonstrate that core value of the Law School. I have every reason to believe that like the School, the Review will continue to grow and \u00afourish in the hands of our students.

It has also brought with it radical implications for the workplace, many of which will surely be grappled with and developed long after the pandemic has passed. Invariably, this context has brought with it many di\u0003culties for the operation of the York Law Review, particularly given that, having been established in 2019, it is so nascent in form. Despite \u0096 and, indeed, especially in light of \u0096 these unique challenges, it gives us great pleasure to introduce the second volume of the Review. \u0001is volume shows the development of the journal, as we move from our inaugural volume to this second and indeed more mature collection of papers. \u0001e volume goes further to showcase the variety of scholarship undertaken and taught at the York Law School. It exhibits how the School is not only pedagogically innovative, but that its methodologically diverse sta\u0002 pass on their skills and expertise to students in a way which sponsors and encourages an equally diverse level of scholarship within the student body. \u0001is volume can be neatly divided into two halves. \u0001e \u00aerst seven pieces are doctrinal and theoretical in nature. \u0001ey examine and analyse a wide variety of legal \u00aeelds \u0096 from criminal culpability in cult environments to international protocols on the patenting of traditional knowledge relating to plants where this can be used for medicinal or other commercial purposes. In interrogating this wide \u00aeeld of subjects, the papers presented in this volume go beyond simply ordering our understanding of law and legal provisions. Instead, they often 2 York Law Review problematise and challenge the extant provisions. Some, such as Amy Butler\u0092s piece on the Overseas Operations Act, do so through historicism and deploy historical happenings as a challenge to current thinking. Comparably, Stephanie Cohen\u0092s piece on hair discrimination deploys both an element of historicism and a racial lens to argue that notions of \u0091ideal hair\u0092 are perpetuated in the professional world through institutional policies and are inadequately dealt with in equalities legislation. \u0001e latter paper was the chosen submission from our postgraduate essay competition, which asked students from across the York Law School\u0092s postgraduate taught programmes to discuss a recent development in the law. In the parallel competition for undergraduate students, Jakub Kozlowski\u0092 s paper was selected. \u0001is piece examines the contentious decision in Weiss II , where Germany\u0092s national Federal Constitutional Court declared a preliminary ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union invalid. Jakub situates the judgment within a growing trend whereby Member States have felt increasingly empowered to disregard EU law when it con\u00aficts with national agendas, in contravention of the long-established concept of the supremacy of EU law, and suggests that this may set a dangerous precedent in light of States such as Poland and Hungary facing internal rule of law crises. Both Stephanie\u0092s and Jakub\u0092s respective papers exemplify the vision for the competitions process, showcasing the capacity of the Law School\u0092s student body to engage with the multifaceted role of law in pressing social issues. Some of our papers, such as Laura Burke\u0092s piece on conscientious moral objection and the Iraq war, draw on theoretical and philosophical arguments to deal with contemporary issues \u0096 in this case, the question of whether Katharine Gun, the former Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) linguist, could be prosecuted under the O\u0003cial Secrets Ac t 1989. \u0001e popular importance of these issues is evident in the fact that the saga was turned into a \u00aelm, O\u0001cial Secrets (2019) starring Keira Knightley. Laura\u0092s work here tackles the tension between legal obedience and moral obligation. In a similar vein, Max Williams\u0092 piece provides an engaging examination of Dworkin's moral reading of 3 Volume \u0002 \u0097 Spring 2021 the United States Constitution. \u0001rough a thorough treatment of three scholars\u0092 criticism of Dworkin\u0092s work, Max convincingly argues that Dworkin\u0092s approach maintains \u00aedelity to the Constitution\u0092s text whilst also protecting minority rights and democratic interests. \u0001e second half of this volume moves away from the doctrinal approaches taken above. \u0001e \u00aerst piece here by Fraser King continues the praxis set in Volume I of showcasing the re\u00afective approach taken to teaching and learning at the York Law School. \u0001e author here has a somewhat unique hybrid position as both a graduate teaching assistant and student, and through this position is able to provide an intriguing re\u00afection on the challenges and opportunities COVID-19 has presented for the law school. \u0001e \u00aenal two pieces signal a slight departure from the methodological approaches taken by York Law Review authors so far. Nabila Okino\u0092s and Ella Allen\u0092s respective articles both draw on empirical studies conducted as part of the LLM in International Human Rights Law and Practice o\u0002ered by York Law School and the University of York\u0092 s Centre for Applied Human Rights (CAHR). \u0001ese are the \u00aerst CAHR pieces published by the Review, and illustrate not only the global scope of legal scholarship undertaken, but also the depth of empirical and socio-legal scholarship embedded in the syllabus. In keeping with the aforementioned re\u00afective emphasis at the York Law School, we felt it important that we should re\u00afect on the growth of the journal as it moves into its second volume. \u0001is volume represents an expansion in many ways. In its most basic and quantitative sense, the number of papers included within the journal has grown from six in its \u00aerst iteration to ten in the current volume. Whilst this has increased the collective workload for the editorial team, the additional strain has been alleviated by a considerable expansion in the team \u0096 from two editorial members in the \u00aerst volume to six in its second year. In light of ongoing restrictions in response to the pandemic, this process has occurred largely through the now-notorious medium of video-conferencing meetings on Zoom. Indeed, it has been a quirk of the year that, as a team, we have spent lots of time in meetings 4 York Law Review and resolving one another\u0092s queries, but have had almost no face-to- face contact whatsoever. \u0001e task of embedding an e\u0002ective structure within this larger team, with clear lines of communication and appropriate workload allocations, has been a challenging but vital process in the journal\u0092s move towards increasing maturity. We have made sure to recognise both where our approach has been e\u0002ective, and where there have been mistakes and experiences from which we can learn, with at least one eye on future editions. \u0001at a sustainable dynamic within the team has been achieved in an entirely online context is to be celebrated. Indeed, communication and learning have been vital elements of the past year for the journal. It is easy to overlook in hindsight the importance of setting up the right platforms for teamwork in the \u0091new normal\u0092. As a team, we found that Trello, a shared task board software that operates much in the same way as a traditional team whiteboard, was an essential tool for setting up a work\u00afow and ensuring that papers progressed through our editorial stages with an appropriate level of speed. It also allowed us to quickly pick up papers where there were particular issues and update each other on progress without clogging our inboxes with e-mails or our calendars with unnecessary meetings. Overall, this year has been about establishing a balance. Establishing a balance within our new, larger team to ensure that the workload is equitably distributed, but also a balance in terms of ensuring that work on the York Law Review is compatible with our own studies. \u0001is is an ongoing learning process, and our colleagues in the editorial team will attest to the fact that we have all felt overwhelmed at times by the level of work involved in bringing this volume to publication. As we move forward, we will continue to work towards more sustainable ways to run the journal throughout the academic year and to spread the workload at the \u0091pressure points\u0092 we experience. We want future editorial teams to inherit a journal with strong and manageable structures that help them to showcase the excellent academic work that takes place at York Law School. 5 Volume \u0002 \u0097 Spring 2021 To that end, we want to acknowledge the sustained, gargantuan e\u0002orts made by our editorial team colleagues throughout the year. \u0001rough their collective hard work and steadfast commitment to bringing this volume to publication in its best possible form, we have produced a collection of papers that we are all truly proud of. Alongside that, despite rarely meeting face-to-face given the current public health situation, we have also built an incredibly strong and supportive team dynamic. \u0001is camaraderie has helped us through the twists and turns that have come with producing this volume, and is a re\u00afection of the truly exceptional team that we have had the honour to be a part of. On a \u00aenal note of thanks, we would also like to extend our gratitude to our sta\u0002 editorial board. \u0001roughout the year, they have acte d as a rudder by providing us with direction, encouragement and support. Our thanks \u00aerst go to Dr Sue Westwood, who has generously given her time on numerous occasions to scrutinise our work and provide the editorial team with such high quality and thought-provoking reviews. Our thanks also go to Martin Philip, the York Law School liaison librarian, who also sits on our board, for providing excellent support throughout the year on matters relating to the publication, marketing, and dissemination of this volume. Our thanks to Dr Jed Meers, whose encyclopaedic knowledge of the University of York as well as his previous experience of editing a student journal have been invaluable throughout this process. And \u00aenally, a special thanks to the chair of our board, Professor Caroline Hunter. \u0001e York Law Review is Caroline \u0092s brainchild, and as she nears the end of her term at the head of York Law School, we hope that this volume and the many other volumes to come in the future will be a source of pride for her as one of the many successful ventures inaugurated during her time in o\u0003ce. Understanding Jonestown: \u0001e Criminal Liabilities of the Port Kaituma Airstrip Shooting and Jonestown Massacre Charlie Tye Abstract \u0001is article explores the extent to which those in a cult environment can be said to be responsible for their actions, and whether unlawful acts should instead be attributed to a controlling mind. It focuses on the Peoples Temple, a cult headed by Jim Jones. In 1977, Jones moved his followers to a remote settlement in Guyana, known informally as Jonestown. Con\u00afict with authorities culminated in Jones ordering the assassination of a US Congressman at the Port Kaituma airstrip. Shortly thereafter, Jones ordered a mass suicide involving nearly 1,000 Jonestown residents. \u0001is paper argues that Jones could be held criminally responsible for the deaths at both the airstrip and at Jonestown. Firstly, by reviewing the literature on coercive persuasion, this paper suggests individuals within the Peoples Temple might be analogous to non-autonomous robots, incapable of criminal responsibility. Automatism is posited as a defence, and the existing principles of causation can be interpreted to attribute the airstrip shooting to Jim Jones, thought to be the controlling mind. Secondly, by dividing the victims of the Jonestown massacre into three theoretical classes, the article argues that the deaths, despite some super\u00aecial willingness, were not voluntary acts and, instead, Jim Jones was the factual and legal cause of death. On this account, the Jonestown Massacre would be an act of murder. A lacking historical account leaves this article hesitant to make de\u00aenitive claims of guilt or innocence, but a su\u0003cient philosophical and doctrinal argument exists for murder charges to be put to a jury. 7 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 1Introduction Jonestown, formally known as the Peoples Temple Agricultural Project, was a remote jungle colony in Guyana established by Jim Jones in 1973. Jones, a political activist turned cult leader, hoped to build a self- sustain ing commune for the followers of his Peoples Temple. \u0001is imagined paradise resulted in approximately 1,000 members, led by Jones, settling in Guyana. Allegations of abuse within the commune attracted the attention of United States (US) Congressman, Leo Ryan, who, with his entourage, visited Jonestown on 17 November 1978. Only one day later, Congressman Ryan sought to leave Jonestown with approximately twenty defecting members of the Peoples Temple. In response, Jones ordered his armed security detail, the Red Brigade, to ambush the congressional party. At the Port Kaituma airstrip, the Red Brigade opened \u00aere, ultimately killing Congressman Ryan and four others, and seriously wounding eleven more. \u0001is event has come to be known as the Port Kaituma Airstrip Shooting. Back in Jonestown, Jones ordered his remaining followers to die by \u0091revolutionary suicide\u0092 \u0096 thought to be the ultimate act of self-sacri\u00aece to defy the cruel injustices in the world. When the Guyanese Defence Force entered the settlement the following day, they found 909 bodies. \u0001is event became an international sensation, responsible for the largest loss of American life in a non-natural disaster until 9/11, known infamously as the Jonestown Massacre. Before these events are contextualised further, it must be recognised that there are inescapable limitations to understanding Jonestown. Professor Rebecca Moore, co-founder of the Jonestown Institute, has long argued that the Jonestown Massacre is clouded by the myth that all victims were gullible individuals manipulated into suicide by a malevolent cult leader, which has arguably stunted academic 8 York Law Review investigation. 1 Even now we do not have a complete account of the historical record. 2 As the \u00afow of information was concentrated in the hands of Jim Jones, he was the only person with a complete picture. 3 Further, anyone who could shed light on our unanswered questions died in Guyana. \u0001is has been described this as the \u0091Jonestown Vortex\u0092, for any answer inevitably invites further questions, meaning subsequent academic work will, at least partially, be based on assumption, hypothesis or conjecture. 4 Despite the gaps in our understanding, Jonestown invites pertinent questions of criminal responsibility, autonomy and capacity. To what extent were members of the Peoples Temple responsible for their actions? Did those who died by revolutionary suicide do so of their own volition? And, fundamentally, to what extent should we attribute the acts of seemingly autonomous moral agents to a secondary \u0091controlling\u0092 mind? In answering these questions, this article seeks to identify legal principles that could be widely applied to determine the criminal liabilities of in\u00afuencers for the unlawful acts they inspire. \u0001is article naturally encounters questions of fr ee will and acknowledges there are those who will not accept the philosophical argument presented. To be clear this paper operates on a compatibilist account of responsibility and of the criminal law. Simply put, whether human beings have free will in a deterministic sense does not undermine our capacity to assign moral responsibility or blame. 5 For the purposes of this paper, the question of whether the individuals analysed are capable of being responsible for their actions is independent of wider questions of free will.

Jones mobilised members of the church to desegregate local businesses, and he and Marceline Jones became the \u00aerst Indianan couple to adopt an African American child. 6 Later, in 1961, he was appointed human rights commissioner. 7 But, even in these early years, there were signs of the abuse to come. Jones routinely deceived his followers with faith healings and threats of divine retribution should they leave the Temple. 8 In 1965, he capitalised on fears of nuclear war to move his followers to Ukiah, California. 9 Jones preached a mishmash of theological and ideological positions, which Beck describes as an amalgamation of Christianity, socialism, communism, and atheism. 10 Jones later described his religiosity as a ploy to direct people towards socialism. 11 Jones adapted this theology to serve his own interests, which ultimately manifested in an explicit claim to divinity. 12 Temple Pastor Hue Forston quoted Jones as saying, 6 Yael Ksander, \u0091Moments of Indiana History: Jim Jones\u0092 ( Indiana Public Media , 25 June 2007) <https://indianapublicmedia.org/momento\u00aendianahistory/jim-jones/> accessed 5 July 2020. 7 Guinn (n 3) 95\u0096101. 8 Tim Reiterman, Raven: \u0002e Untold Story of the Rev Jim Jones and His People (Tarcherperigee 2008) 54. 9 Guinn (n 3) 110. 10 Don Beck, \u0091 \u0001e \u0001 eology of Peoples Tem ple: A View From Inside\u0092 ( Alternative Considerations of Jonestown & Peoples Temple , 25 July 2013) <https://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=33195> accessed 5 July 2020. 11 Guinn (n 3) 28. 12 Reiterman (n 8) 93. 10 York Law Review \u0091[I]f you need a father, I'll be your father. If you need a friend, I'll be your friend. If you see me as a God, I'll be your God.\u0092 13 Jones abused his divine status proli\u00aecally ; even targeting devotees for sexual favours was on theological grounds. Representing himself as a god, Jones was the epitome of desire and the honour of having sex with him would inspire loyalty among Temple women. 14 Men were also targeted; Jones claimed to be the world 's only heterosexual, and male followers required sexual humbling to overcome their secret homosexuality. 15 David Parker Wise described Jones as using his divine status to seduce young women and dominate any man he felt threatened by. 16 Jones demanded 10 per cent of a member's monthly income, though he preferred 25. Recruits would sign over their homes, surrender their social security, and donate their possessions to live in Temple communes. 17 Tim and Jean Clancy, both members of the Peoples Temple, described being worked to excess, being told to dedicate everything to the cause, and being so sleep-deprived that questioning Jones was not possible. 18 Jones described his ethos as \u0091keep them poor, and keep them tired, and they'll never leave\u0092. 19 Control was further exerted through \u0091catharsis sessions\u0092 where adult members were publicly shamed for dissent. 20 Members were conditioned to venerate Jim Jones in all aspects of their lives, and Jones backed that conditioning with force. 13 Fondakowski (n 4) 67. 14 Guinn (n 3) 222\u009623. 15 Reiterman (n 8) 171\u009680. 16 David Parker Wise, \u0091Sex in Peoples Temple ( Alternative Considerations of Jonestown & Peoples Temple , 9 March 2013) <https://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=17014> accessed 3 July 2020. 17 Guinn (n 3) 181\u009684, 190. 18 Fondakowski (n 4) 167. 19 Guinn (n 3) 195. 20 Guinn (n 3) 240. 11 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 Jones wielded his Planning Commission as a pseudo-judicial system. 21 Drinking alcohol, smoking, interacting with outsiders, and unsanctioned romantic relationships earned Jones's ire. Punishments ranged from public shaming to group beatings or assaults with a rubber hose. 22 Mike Cartmell, who defected from the Temple in 1977, observed Jones forcing members to box before the congregation, one victim being a three-year-old whose own mother encouraged the violence. 23 Vigorous psychological, \u00aenancial, and extrajudicial control were commonplace within the Peoples Temple. Consequently, members were vulnerable to Jones's coercion, deception, and manipulation long before they reached Guyana. 1.2 Jonestown A string of defections in 1977 exposed the Temple's abusive practices and, to escape scrutiny, Jones began a mass exodus to Guyana. 24 He acquired the Jonestown site in 1974, and established a settlement in 1975, which developed into a small community encased by one of the world's densest jungles. 25 By September 1977, Jones had moved nearly 1,000 members to Jonestown. 26 Jones's eldest son, Stephan, attested to widespread discontent when settlers realised their tropical paradise was much less than advertised. 27 Jonestown was not ready for such a large in\u00afux of people; it was immediately overcrowded and food supplies were 21 Fondakowski (n 4) 179. 22 Guinn (n 3) 192, 285. 23 Mike Cartmell, \u0091Why We Left\u0092 ( Alternative Considerations of Jonestown & Peoples Temple , 25 July 2013) <https://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=31351> accessed 3 July 2020. 24 ibid 331\u009640. 25 Guinn (n 3) 2\u00965. 26 Reiterman (n 8) 337. 27 Fondakowski (n 4) 202. 12 York Law Review heavily constrained. 28 Everyone surrendered their passports and personal belongings, whilst Jones deployed armed guards to deter defectors. 29 To many, life in Jonestown was characterised by backbreaking labour, primitive surroundings, limited rations, strict rules, and the absolute power of Jim Jones. 30 Discipline reached new heights in Jonestown. 31\u0001ose who violated his rules were subjected to group beatings, social ostracisation, or degradation in the Public Service Crew, meaning members were often afraid of everyone around them. In extreme cases, adult members were con\u00aened to a sensory deprivation box and buried underground. 32 In one instance, two escapees were recaptured and held in leg irons for several weeks. 33 Eventually, Jones established the Extended Care Unit, where troublemakers would be drugged. 34 De\u00aeance in Jonestown was punished harshly, and residents had every reason to be afraid of disobeying Jones. 1.3 White Nights As Jones described it, his \u00afock narrowly escaped the terrors of the United States, where, Jones claimed, the Ku Klux Klan was ascendant, fascism had all but taken over and military leaders were planning for the genocide of African Americans. 35 To keep the threat alive, Jim Jones Jr assisted his father in faking two assassination attempts. 36 Jones then \u00afew a private investigator to the commune, who made outlandish 28 Guinn (n 3) 355. 29Guinn (n 3) 75; Reiterman (n 8) 451. 30 Guinn (n 3) 365. 31 Guinn (n 3) 365. 32 Reiterman (n 8) 334\u009635, 393\u009694. 33 Guinn (n 3) 386. 34 Reiterman (n 8) 450. 35Reiterman (n 8) 451; Guinn (n 3) 360. 36 Fondakowski (n 4) 157\u009658. 13 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 claims about leading armed mercenaries to the compound. 37 Jonestown was rife with fear and tension; everyone expected an attack from anywhere at any time. \u0001is tension culminated in the \u0091Six Day Siege\u0092. Owing to a custody dispute, in which Jones unlawfully retained control of a six-year old child, a Guyanese court issued a warrant for Jones's arrest. In response, Jones called his followers to attention on 7 September 1977 and told them the Guyanese Defence Force would attack. 38 Weapons were distributed and, for the next six days, his followers stood at the perimeter ready to \u00aeght \u00aectional invaders. To maintain the illusion of a siege, Jones ordered his security to \u00aere into the compound and proclaimed their willingness to die rather than hand themselves over. 39 \u0001e invaders never materialised; Jones was able to have the warrant suspended and declared victory. As a consequence of the \u0091siege\u0092, in early 1978 Jones began the practice of \u0091white nights\u0092.

On 13 November 1978, a congressional party \u00afew to Guyana to visit Jonestown. 43 Jim Jones initially resisted but was convinced to allow Ryan into the commune. 44\u0001e congressional party were permitted to speak with whomever they wished, the press interviewed enthusiastic settlers, and Congressman Ryan praised the community to rapturous applause. 45 Whilst the visit appeared to be successful, unbeknownst to Jones, that same evening, Vernon Gosney, a resident of Jonestown, passed a note to a member of the press asking for help in escaping Jonestown. \u0001e following day, 26 more residents defected and asked to leave with the Congressman. 46 Congressman Ryan intended to remain in Jonestown to process any remaining defectors, but was forced to withdraw after a resident, Don Sly, attacked him with a knife. 47\u0001e congressional party left Jonestown with the defectors, but were joined by an armed double agent sent to in\u00aeltrate the group. Shortly after they arrived at a nearby airstrip to await evacuation, armed members of Jonestown's internal security, the Red Brigade, pulled onto the tarmac and opened \u00aere. 48 Congressman Ryan, three members of the press, and one of the defectors were 42Reiterman (n 8) 399; Dianne E Scheid, \u0091\u0001e Plain Ugly Truth \u0092 (Alternative Considerations of Jonestown & Peoples Temple , 25 July 2013) <https://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=31947> accessed 7 July 2020, 63. 43 Reiterman (n 8) 457\u009666. 44 Guinn (n 3) 423. 45 Reiterman (n 8) 487\u0096503. 46 Guinn (n 3) 432. 47 Guinn (n 3) 433\u009634. 48 Fondakowski (n 4) 231\u009633. 15 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 killed. 49 Leo Ryan became the only US Congressman to die in the line of duty, while in Jonestown the \u00aenal \u0091white night\u0092 began. As with all \u0091white nights\u0092, Jones called everyone to attention. \u0001is time, he claimed the threat was real and soldiers would soon descend to destroy Jonestown. To avoid this fate, Jones called for revolutionary suicide. 50 A mixture of cyanide, sedatives, and grape Flavor Aid was administered to the 300 children of the commune. 51 Jones admonished anyone who cried as the children screamed. 52 Vats of poison were presented for the adults to drink. Although it is unknown how many complied with this demand, the residents, one way or another, were put to death. Jim Jones died of a gunshot wound to the head; it is commonly believed to be the result of suicide. In total, including the congressional party, 918 people lost their lives. 53 2\u0001e Port Kaituma Airstrip Shooting \u0001is section examines the criminal liabilities arising from the Port Kaituma Airstrip Shooting and, speci\u00aecally, the events following Congressman Ryan's withdrawal from Jonestown with several defectors, including the double agent, to the Port Kaituma Airstrip. 54 At the airstrip, armed members of the Red Brigade ambushed the congressional party and opened \u00aere.

In the \u00aenal Jonestown recording, Jones referenced a plot to shoot down Congressman Ryan's plane and a jury later convicted the double agent of conspiracy to murder, amongst several other crimes related to the airstrip shooting, and he was subsequently imprisoned for 18 years. 57 As Jones and the remainder of the Red Brigade were later killed in the Jonestown Massacre, no further prosecutions were possible. However, working on the assumption that Jones and the Red Brigade targeted Congressman Ryan for assassination, it is argued that \u00aeve counts of murder and 11 of attempted murder arise from the airstrip shooting. Murder is committed when a person of sound mind unlawfully kills another creature in being with malice aforethought. 58\u0001e modern interpretation of malice aforethought is a speci\u00aec intention to kill or commit grievous bodily harm. 59\u0001e fact that the fatal harm intended for Congressman Ryan struck innocent parties changes nothing ; the intention to kill can be transferred onto every victim killed or wounded during the shooting. 60 But we must question the extent to which the Red Brigade were capable of criminal responsibility in light of the pressures exerted by the cult. Can the criminal law recognise Jones as the controlling mind behind the shooting? To address these questions, let us begin with the Red Brigade and a theory of coercive persuasion. 55 Fondakowski (n 4) 231\u009633. 56 Fondakowski (n 4) chs 14\u009615. 57 \u0091Death Tape\u0092 (n 50) ; United States v Layton 549 F Supp 903 (ND 1982). 58 3 Co Inst 47. 59R v Cunningham UKHL \u0097 Spring 2021 2.1 Coercive Persuasion Traditionally, coercive persuasion is synonymous with notions of brainwashing, thought control, or the idea that through cultic control one person can be totally subsumed by another. Singer and West developed a theory, building upon earlier research documenting prisoners in re-education camps. 61\u0001rough systematic isolation, exhaustion, deprivation, emotional manipulation, and ritualised peer pressure, coercive persuasion is thought to undermine the victim's sense of identity and they are, ultimately, reconstructed to be subordinate to the will of another. 62 Brown describes coercive persuasion as enabling an indoctrinator to usurp the victim's view of reality and condition them towards speci\u00aec behavioural patterns. 63 Shapiro analogised this as a form of psychological bondage that strips the victim of the attributes that make them an autonomous human being. 64\u0001ey are transformed from independent moral agents into robots subject to a programmer they cannot defy. Coercive persuasion could be said to have characterised the Peoples Temple long before the exodus to Guyana. \u0001rough coercive tactics, members were expected to break with their \u0091bourgeois\u0092 identities and be reconstructed as good socialists, subordinate to the Peoples Temple. In Jonestown, this coercion was escalated; residents became physically dependant on Jones, who ruled the settlement as his personal \u00aeefdom. 65 \u0001eir identities were so compromised that Jones could order residents 61 Louis Jolyon West and Margaret Singer, \u0091Cults, Quacks, and Non-Professional Psychotherapies\u0092 in Harold I Kaplan, Alfred Freedman and Benjamin J Sadock (eds), Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry (Williams & Wilkins 1980) 3245\u009658. 62 ibid. 63 Laura Brown, \u0091He Who Controls the Mind Controls the Body: False Imprisonment, Religious Cults, and the Destruction of Volitional Capacity\u0092 (1991) 25(3) Valparaiso U L Rev 407, 410\u009616, 413. 64 Robert Shapiro, \u0091Of Robots, Persons, and the Protection of Religious Beliefs\u0092 (1983) 56 Cal L Rev 1277, 1279, 1281\u009682. 65Reiterman (n 8) 450; Guinn (n 3) 386. 18 York Law Review to write detailed essays on how to torture and kill former loved ones trying to bring them home. 66 It is on this basis it could be argued the Red Brigade were victims of coercive persuasion, reduced from independent moral agents to non-autonomous robots. Criminal responsibility is contingent upon personhood, which is made up of volition and desire states. Volition describes simple actions, including the functional state by which an individual moves their body in a certain way. For example, it is by Alice's volition that she picks up the gun and p ulls the trigger. \u0001e desire state describes the speci\u00aec outcome her volition intended to produce; Alice pulls the trigger to realise her desire of seeing James dead. 67 Alice's volition and desire must be joined to trigger criminal responsibility; neither \u00aering a gun nor desiring another to die is, in and of itself, a criminal o\u0002ence. In shooting and killing James, Alice's volition has caused the death of another, but this is not suYcient to hold her criminally responsible. Alice must desire to kill or grievously wound to be culpable of murder ; alternatively, she could be culpable of manslaughter if she held a di\u0002erent desire state. But, if Alice's volition and desire state are divorced \u0097 for example, if her actions are the result of a re\u00afex or involuntary action \u0097 she is not culpable. 68 Coercive persuasion uncouples a victim's volition from their desire state, transforming them into a metaphorical robot who lacks capacity for independent voluntary action. Criminal responsibility is contingent on the capacity to respond to one's own reasoning and modify one's behaviour accordingly. \u0001is necessarily depends on autonomy and responsibility. For some, a person has autonomy provided they can choose between multiple courses of action; they are responsible if t hey 66 Reiterman (n 8) 428. 67 Vincent Chiao, \u0091Action and Agency in the Criminal Law\u0092 (2009) 15 LEG 1, 5\u00966. 68 ibid 6\u00967. 19 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 can understand and comply with social and legal expectations. 69 Robots, for example, do not have independent reasoning but respond automatically to the reasons of another; they are an extension of a programmer's volition. If the standards by which we propose to scrutinise their behaviour are external to their mode of thinking, robots cannot be morally or legally culpable. 70 In response to this, Emory proposed a speci\u00aec \u0091brainwashing\u0092 defence. 71 If coercive persuasion breaks and rebuilds the victim to serve the interests of another, their mental processes and behavioural controls are so impaired that their actions cannot be said to be their own. In law, this may be considered akin to insanity. 72\u0001e victim has no goal beyond appeasing their indoctrinator and acts exclusively to further those interests. 73 It is on this basis that it could be argued the Red Brigade ought to be excused their criminal acts. However, without re\u00aenement this defence could be too widely applied. Coercive persuasion has been partially inspired by Robert Lifton's account of thought reform in communist re-education camps where totalitarian control was present, although its e\u0002ectiveness was only temporary. 74 Victims who returned to the West reverted to their previous selves as the coercive persuasion was unsustainable without 69 Nora Markwalder and Monika Simmler, \u0091Guilty Personhood in an Age of Arti\u00aecial Intelligence Criminal Law\u0092 (2019) 20 Crim L Forum 1, 11. 70 Larry Alexander and Kimberly Kessler Ferzan, Crime and Culpability: A \u0002eory of Criminal Law (CUP 2009) 155\u009660. 71 Rebecca Emory, \u0091Losing \u0003our Head in the Washer \u0097 Why the Brainwashing Defense Can Be a Complete Defense in Criminal Cases\u0092 (2010) 30(4) Pace LR 1338.

Stein coined the term to describe how cults use isolation to e\u0002ect indoctrination. 78 A totalist system isolates members from their prior support structures and sense of identity, and enforces ideological purity to limit interaction between followers. Such actions are capable of exhausting victims to isolate them from their own thoughts. 79 It is in this totalist environment that victims are subject to coercive persuasion, which begins the protracted process of their transformation into robots. 80 Totalist systems accomplish this through external threat and internal stress. \u0001e external threat is a nebulous insurmountable force that members cannot withstand beyond taking refuge within the group, whereas internal stresses, such as deprivation, hunger, and exhaustion, 75 ibid 61\u009663, 84. 76 James T Richardson, \u0091Cult/Brainwashing Cases and Freedom of Religion\u0092 (1991) 33(1) J Church & State 55, 60\u009661. 77\u0001omas Robbins and Dick Anthony, \u0091\u0001e Limits of \u0093Coercive Persuasion\u0094 as an Explanation for Conversion to Authoritarian Sects\u0092 (1980) 2(2) Polit Psychol 22. 78 Alexandra Stein, Terror, Love and Brainwashing: Attachment in Cults and Totalitarian Systems (Routledge 2016) Totalist Indoctrination. 21 \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 deplete cognitive resources, limit self-re\u00afection, and prevent the victim from challenging their environment. 81\u0001e victim becomes more susceptible to fearing the external threat and more likely to seek comfort within the group, which, in turn, exacerbates their fear. 82\u0001is becomes a constant cycle of trauma, undermining the victim's identity and autonomy, which, if left unchecked, could see them subordinated to the will of another. Most cults cannot operate a totalist system unchecked. Members cannot be totally separated from the outside world and will inevitably be exposed to external in\u00afuences. It is through this that they can form the necessary connections to escape the cult, informally known as the escape hatch. 83\u0001e cycle of trauma can be interrupted and escaped so long as members have the capacity to form escape hatch connections. So long as this is true, the totalist system is incomplete and, thus, the process of coercive persuasion is imperfect. \u0001e complete totalist system perfects the process by closing the escape hatch; it succeeds by totally isolating members and perpetually subjecting them to the traumatic cycle. It is this which reduces the individual to a non- autonomous robot-like state. Selisker describes this transformation as being analogous to the \u0091break\u0092, a phenomenon associated with victims of torture where their reality is reduced to a single set of rooms and experiences. 84 Coercive persuasion in a complete totalist environment may a\u0002ect constant trauma suYcient to produce something similar known as the \u0091snap\u0092. \u0001e snap dilutes and restricts the individual's perception of reality until they are de\u00aened by their totalitarian environment. \u0001ey are enthralled to their indoctrinator and conditioned to behave as if they were a human automaton. 85 81 ibid 69\u009670. 82 and Unfreedom (University of Press 2016) ch 4, 130\u009632. 85 ibid 132, 136\u009642. 22 York Law Review \u0001e Peoples Temple in California could be described as an incomplete totalist system. Whilst members were cut o\u0002 from external support networks, deterred from defection, and subject to the external threats and internal stresses, Jones could not totally isolate or physically restrain his followers without consequence. In this sense, members, if they so wished, were able to form escape hatch connections and walk away. \u0001e cycle of trauma could not entirely strip them of autonomy. Jonestown, by contrast, might be described as a complete totalist system. Residents could not leave of their own volition as their passports were seized on arrival, they were encased on all sides by a deadly jungle, and they were unable to communicate with the outside world. \u0001is traumatic cycle could be repeated in perpetuity and it is feasible that some members experienced the snap and became subordinate robot-like beings. 2.3 Robots Totalism depends on coercive persuasion but only in extreme cases does it deprive members of their autonomy. When determining whether a totalist system is complete, the robot analogy proves illuminative. \u0003ing distinguishes between autonomous robots who act independently in accordance with their programming and individuals who act merely as tools performing automatic functions. 86 Programming in the \u00aerst instance serves as a value system, generating principles by which the robot interacts independently with the outside world. 87\u0001is robot would be capable of communicating their decision-making with reference to those principles and their environment; this is the hypothetical smart robot. Smart robots possess the bare minimum of rationality necessary for criminal responsibility to be attached. 88 Victims of coercive persuasion in an incomplete totalist system could be conceived of as 86 \u0003ing Hu, \u0091Robot Criminals\u0092 (2019) 52 U Mich J L Reform 487. 87 ibid 499\u0096500. 88 ibid 497\u0096512, Spring 2021 smart robots; trauma would have induced a partially robotic state but stopped short of destroying their autonomy. \u0001e incomplete totalist environment in California may have prevented members from becoming automatons. Instead, members may have been the equivalent of smart robots, impaired by a value system imposed upon them through coercive persuasion, but with their decision-making capacity still intact. Consequently, their impaired reasoning was still suYcient to attract criminal responsibility. \u0001is change d in Guyana. It is feasible residents were subjected to a complete totalist system in which reality began and ended in Jonestown. \u0001e outside world ceased to exist, and an unbroken cycle of trauma could strip them of the autonomy and responsibility attributed to smart robots. To Gless, robots without the capacity for self-re\u00afection and moral evaluation cannot be considered culpable. 89 Instead, they are tools, a blameless means by which another e\u0002ects their will on the world. 90 It is plausible that the totalistic environment in Jonestown allowed unimpeded trauma to reduce the Red Brigade to a robotic state where they served as the tools of another. Mere tools are incapable of moral reasoning; if we do not blame the drone for the murder ordered by its pilot, it stands to reason that we should not blame the Red Brigade for an assassination commanded by Jim Jones. 2.4 Proposed Legal Argument: Automatism For the criminal law to distinguish between smart robots and robots without capacity, the defence of automatism is proposed. Automatism is the claim a defendant's consciousness is so divorced from their 89 Sabine Gless, \u0091If Robots Cause Harm, Who Is to Blame? Self-Driving Cars and Criminal Liability\u0092 (2016) 19(3) New Crim L Rev 412, 416\u009623. 90 ibid 425. 24 York Law Review actions that they must be involuntary. 91 In Burgess , the court described a defendant who successfully relied on automatism as su\u0002ering a defect of reason, and was therefore exonerated on the grounds that they acted without conscious motivation. 92\u0001is is a high thresh old that requires the defendant's mind to be so compromised as to construct their actions as involuntary re\u00afexes. 93 For automatism to be sustained, a defendant must demonstrate their mind was entirely detached from their body. 94 \u0001is was clari\u00aeed by the Court of Appeal in Attorney General's Reference No 2 to mean a defendant su\u0002ering from a \u0091total destruction of voluntary control\u0092. 95\u0001e aforementioned class of smart robots would not meet this threshold and would therefore be criminally responsible for their actions. Robots who lack the necessary capacity after being subject to a complete totalist system may satisfy the criteria, permitting them to rely on automatism. In practice, it would be for juries to determine whether a defendant is so impaired by coercive persuasion as to be considered criminally non-culpable. In Coley , Coley sought to rely on automatism after being convicted of attempted murder, a crime allegedly committed in a psychotic state where he believed himself to be a video game character. 96\u0001e court denied this appeal, breaking down the o\u0002ence into its components. Coley decided to break into another's home, decided to arm himself, decided to dress for the occasion, and, delusional or not, had a clearly conscious motivation. Automatism requires the defendant's actions to be completely beyond their control. 97 Initially this might be said to exclude members of the Red Brigade from automatism: they armed themselves, followed the congressional party, and opened \u00aere. 91 John Child and David Ormerod, Smith, Hogan, & Ormerod's Essentials of Criminal Law (3rd edn, OUP 2019) 307. 92R v Burgess [1991] 2 QB 92 (CA). 93Watmore [1962] 2 QB 572 (QB). 94R v Isitt (1978) 67 Cr App R 44 (CA). 95Attorney General's Reference (No 2 of 1992) Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 However, coercive persuasion informs us that a victim subject to an unimpeded cycle of trauma is reduced to a non-autonomous robot incapable of making any decisions. On this account, the Red Brigade simply took the necessary steps to execute their programming. While coercive persuasion is yet to be recognised by the courts, external, but extreme, trauma is capable of inducing automatism. In Hennessy , stress and anxiety were rejected as triggers for automatism as they were facts of life and not at all extraordinary. 98 Although no precise de\u00aenition of extraordinary trauma was given, when considering the complete totalist system that members of the Red Brigade were subject to, it is diYcult to envision a more extreme set of facts. In R v T, a defendant who claimed her actions were driven by a dreamlike state caused by rape successfully relied on automatism; a largely unreported Crown Court decision was later endorsed by the Court of Appeal. 99 It stands to reason that, if physical and psychological trauma is capable of inducing automatism, it would not be a novel stretch for this to be true for those subjected to a complete totalist system. \u0001ere is a distinct di\u0002erence between these types of trauma : rape is necessarily non-consensual, but this is not true for coercive persuasion. In the Peoples Temple, going to Jonestown was an honour and residents entered the commune of their own volition. In Bailey , a defendant who voluntarily failed to take their medication was not permitted to rely on automatism when it resulted in him attacking another with an iron bar. 100 Defendants who recklessly or intentionally put themselves in a position likely to induce automatism cannot then bene\u00aet from the defence. 101 It could be argued that the Red Brigade are in the same position, for they were capable of independent choice when they 98R v Hennessy [1989] EWCA Crim LR 256 (note) ; Brian Riley, \u0091Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Dissociative State v Bailey [1983] EWCA Crim 101 ibid 765 (GriYth LJ). 26 York Law Review decided to migrate to Jonestown. \u0001e coercion of the Peoples Temple was well known by the time of the exodus, and thus it could be argued the Red Brigade would have known their migration was likely to result in trauma. It is important to consider whether this should be a barrier to the defence of automatism. It is argued that, while trauma may have been foreseeable, the harm was not. In the case of Hardie , the defendant was permitted to rely on automatism despite consensually taking Valium, for there was no obvious connection between the drug and the resulting arson. \u0001e question for the jury was whether taking the drug was suYciently reckless as to merit a guilty verdict. 102 Murder is a crime of speci\u00aec intention \u0097 it cannot be committed recklessly \u0097 thus for automatism to be entirely disregarded there must be a precise connection between the defendant's voluntary act and the death. Whether or not members of the Red Brigade knowingly entered a traumatic environment, it is diYcult to comprehend they held the necessary foresight that they would be deployed as assassins in a Guyanese jungle. It is on this basis that automatism should not be dismissed outright but should be left to a jury. 2.5 Proposed Legal Argument: Jim Jones If we are to construct the Red Brigade as non-autonomous robots, then, logically, responsibility for their actions would reside with a secondary controller. \u0001is controlling mind would be culpable for the actions it ordered of its human automatons, as if it had used any other tool to ful\u00ael their criminal intent. For the Red Brigade, this controlling mind was Jim Jones. It is therefore pertinent to consider whether the criminal law could hold Jim Jones accountable for the murders and attempted murders he set in motion. 102R v Hardie [1984] EWCA 2021 \u0001e \u00aerst question is factual causation: whether we can attribute the crime to the defendant's actions. Since White , causation has been determined through the \u0091but for test\u0092, that is, but for the defendant's actions would death have occurred? 103 Jones may not have pulled the trigger, but his orders set a chain of events in motion without which death would not have occurred. \u0001is is his criminal act. 104 A charge of murder is not con\u00aened to those who deliver the killing blow but can \u00afow from any act or omission that results in death. 105 Given that the airstrip shooting and resulting deaths \u00afowed directly from the commands of Jim Jones, there is a case to be made that factual causation is satis\u00aeed. \u0001e second question we must consider is legal causation, tha t is, whether the defendant's act or omission signi\u00aecantly contributed to the resulting harm. 106\u0001is requires an intrinsic link between the defendant 's conduct and the harm caused. 107 An intrinsic link exists so long as the defendant's action directly and signi\u00aecantly contributes to death. 108 For example, in Kennedy , the House of Lords ruled that a defendant could not be charged with manslaughter for preparing and handing a syringe full of heroin to the deceased, for unless his action directly caused the victim to inject the drug there was no intrinsic link, 109 while in Mellor the defendant could be convicted of murder when they in\u00aficted injuries that brought on fatal broncho-pneumonia. 110 103R v White [1910] 2 KB 124 (CA). 104 ibid 130 (Bray J). 105R v Gibbins and Proctor (1919) 13 Cr App R 134 (CA) 139 (Darling J); R v 1 AC 269. 110R v Mellor (1996) 2 Cr App R 245 (CA). 28 York Law Review Orders given by Jim Jones to his non-autonomous subordinates to kill are intrinsically tied to the resultant deaths. In Bentley , a defendant who shouted \u0091let him have it\u0092 to an armed accomplice who then shot a police oYcer was convicted and executed for murder. Decades later, the conviction was quashed, though the Court of Appeal reinforced that a properly directed jury would be entitled to convict the defendant of murder on these facts. 111 \u0001e defendant does not need to be the sole cause of death; their contributions can remain signi\u00aecant even with others involved. 112 If a defendant set in motion a chain of events calculated to cause death or grievous bodily harm, their intention \u00afows through all subsequent acts. 113Attorney General's Reference No 3 clari\u00aees this to mean death is treated in law as if it occurred at the moment the chain was set in motion. 114 In this sense, Jim Jones set a chain of events in motion the moment he ordered his followers to kill; it should be as if the shooting happened then and there. Direct contact is unnecessary; the deaths cannot be separated from his command and thus he ought to be culpable for them. 115 \u0001e actions of the Red Brigade should not be suYcient to break the chain of causation. In Cogan and Leak , Leak facilitated the rape of his wife by misleading Cogan into thinking she wanted to have sex with him. 116 Cogan was charged and acquitted of rape, though Leak was convicted of aiding and abetting rape. \u0001e Court of Appeal upheld Leak's conviction on the grounds that he used Cogan to procure a criminal purpose. Similarly, in DPP v K , two defendants who 111R v Bentley (2001) 1 Cr App R 21 (CA). 112R v Benge (1865) 4 F & F 504, 176 ER 665; R v Cheshire [1991] 1 WLR 1 3 of 1994) [1997] UKHL 31, [1998] AC 245, 261 (Lord Mustill). 115R v Mitchell [1983] QB 74 1 (CA); R Smith [1959] 2 (CA). Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 imprisoned a young girl and instructed another boy to penetrate her were also liable for rape. 117 Once again, the defendants were responsible because they used another person as their tool. In Cogan , the tool was an independent moral agent ; in K the tool was a vulnerable young boy. To that end, this principle should be easily extended to any non-autonomous robot-like beings in Jonestown. If Jones used coercive persuasion within a totalist system to subordinate the Red Brigade to his will, he used them as tools to facilitate his criminal purpose and ought to be liable for the o\u0002ences procured. On this account, the criminal law can hold Jim Jones to account for the murders and attempted murders arising from the airstrip shooting. Jones set in motion a chain of events where death was a natural consequence of his orders. He remained a factual, substantial, and operating cause of death as if he had possessed and programmed armed drones to kill Congressman Ryan. \u0001e fact that his drones were human beings change s nothing; factual and legal causation can be satis\u00aeed and, thus, there is a case to go before a jury. 3\u0001e Jonestown Massacre During the early evening of 18 November 1978, Jones summoned the residents to the central pavilion. He claimed responsibility for the plot to kill Congressman Ryan and warned that Temple enemies would invade Jonestown in retaliation. Couched in the language of mercy, he called for revolutionary suicide. 118 \u0001e children were put to death \u00aerst. Using syringes to strategically trigger the swallow re\u00afex, nurses squirted a mixture laced with cyanide down their throats. Older residents were similarly injected in their cabins. \u0001ere is little controversy here; anyone forcefully injected with 117DPP v K [1997] 1 Cr App R 36 (QB). 118 Death Tape (n 50) 3. 30 York Law Review cyanide by another has been murdered. Murder charges against Jones could be established on the existing principles of joint enterprise in this respect. 119\u0001us, this article is more concerned with resolving the liabilities of the subsequent victims. Under the watch of armed guards, vats of poison were presented to the adults, who were expected to drink. We will never know how many complied. A Guyanese medical examiner, Dr Mootoo, suggested some might have been forcibly injected and there are historical accounts to that e\u0002ect. 120\u0001is is, of course, specul ation as the advanced decomposition of the Jonestown dead prevented a de\u00aenitive analysis. Rebecca Moore identi\u00aeed a consensus that the vast majority drank the poison of their own volition, leaving a small minority of dissenters who did not. 121 Chidester describes the Jonestown Massacre as being motivated by the genuine belief that suicide was preferable to the dehumanising death members expected from external invaders. 122 Jones claimed anyone who survived him would be seized by invading fascists, tortured, and deported to concentration camps. 123 Suicide became merciful in comparison to the brutality of an outside invader, and this rhetoric was integral to life in Jonestown. 124 Each white night was driven by Jones passionately arguing that suicide was merciful when compared with 119R v Jogee [2016] 13 Carter, \u0091Murder or Suicide: What I Saw\u0092 ( Alternative Considerations of Jonestown & Peoples Temple , 25 July 2013) <https://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=31976> accessed 5 July 2020. 121 Rebecca Moore, \u0091Rhetoric, Revolution, and Resistance in Jonestown, Guyana\u0092 (2013) 1(3) J Relig Violence 303\u009605. 122 David Chidester, Salvation and Suicide: Jim Jones, the Peoples Temple, and Jonestown (Indiana UP 2003). 123 ibid 131\u009646. 124 Moore, \u0091Rhetoric, Revolution, and Resistance in Jonestown, Guyana\u0092 (n 121) 306\u0096 08. 31 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 fascist torture. 125\u0001is even extended to heaping praise on parents who promised to kill their own children before they fell into enemy hands. 126 Moore observes that the Peoples Temple had long preached the virtue of self-sacri\u00aece, which facilitated the eventual shared view of the Jonestown Community that swift and merciful death epitomised love and compassion. 127 Only through revolutionary suicide could the residents defy their oppressor, escape a dehumanising death, and protest the inhumanity of the world. 128 Jones's culpability is grounded in deceit. America had not fallen to fascism, there were no concentration camps, and no outside invaders were ready to torture the Jonestown population. Nothing on the scale he described was ever going to happ en. \u0001e dehumanising death his followers sought to escape was a \u00aection. However, Jones's culpability may go well beyond lying. Not only did he plan for this eventuality but he rehearsed his followers for the inevitability of mass suicide and directed his agents to import and test potassium cyanide. 129 His deceit was no spontaneous act but part of a wider pattern to realise his ambitions for mass suicide. Jones used manipulation, coercion, and deception to kill his followers. It is on this basis that it is argued he ought to be constructed as a murderer. To address each type of conduct, the victims are divided into three classes. First, the non-autonomous robot-like members of the community, whose existence was posited earlier. Second, those who were coerced to take the poison because the alternative was to be forcefully injected or shot. Finally, true believers, who genuinely believed Jim Jones and died to avoid the dehumanising death they were 125 Moore, \u0091Rhetoric, Revolution, and Resistance in Jonestown, Guyana\u0092 (n 121) 314. 126 Chidester (n 122) 147. 127 Moore, \u0091Rhetoric, Revolution, and Resistance in Jonestown, Guyana\u0092 (n 121) 307. 128 Moore, \u0091Rhetoric, Revolution, and Resistance in Jonestown, Guyana\u0092 (n 121) 317. 129Guinn (n 3) 389; \u0091Memo From Dr Schacht\u0092 (Alternative Considerations of Jonestown & Peoples Temple). 32 York Law Review deceived into expecting. It is likely members that Jim Jones did not act alone ; many of his inner circle were aware of both his deception and murderous ambitions. 130 It should be noted these descriptions capture a set of logical spaces rather than an empirical description. Each category de\u00aenes a possible type. Whether in fact there were any tokens of these types and, if so, how many, is an empirical question not only beyond the scope of this article but also beyond the scope of the historical record as we have it. Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge that these categorical heuristic devices are deployed here to develop our understanding of potential liability of Jones and his victims. \u0001ey do not attempt represent the lived reality of those present in Jonestown nor are they intended undermine the truly catastrophic human tragedy that took place. 3.1 \u0001e Robots Say a robot, programmed to obey an operator, is built with a self- destruct button. \u0001e robot is an amoral tool by which the operator exerts their will on the world. \u0001e operator would therefore be solely responsible should the robot be ordered to kill. A robot ordered to press the self-destruct button is no more responsible for suicide than for the killing. \u0001e robot 's self-destruction is caused by the operator. If the robot is replaced with a human actor ordered to destroy their sense of self via mind control, the operator would be liable for murder. It is posited that residents were subordinated to Jones, so that they had become non-autonomous robot-like beings and were incapable of drinking the poison of their own volition. But for Jones's command to self-destruct, their deaths would not have occurred, thus factual causation could still be satis\u00aeed as Jones remained a substantial and 130 Whilst their culpability is beyond the scope of the paper, it is likely they would also attract a high degree of criminal liability. 33 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 operating cause of death. Neither legal nor factual causation is undermined when a robot's violence is directed inwards. Consequently, it would be appropriate for a jury to determine whether Jim Jones murdered his non-autonomous robots. 3.2 \u0001e Coerced Whatever residents made of the dehumanising death Jones promised, the Peoples Temple was no monolith. It is evident not everyone wished to die. Christine Miller verbally dissented, Marceline Jones resisted to the point Jim Jones ordered she be physically restrained, and three successfully escaped the commune. 131 For those who did not want to die but could not escape, the notion that they were coerced is a distinct possibility. Armed members of the Red Brigade patrolled the pavilion, and it is possible dissenters were forcefully injected with cyanide. Residents were given a simple choice: drink the poison, be injected with the poison, or be shot by the Red Brigade. To demonstrate the threat this poses to victim autonomy, consider the following hypothetical. Say Alice approaches James with a gun, throws him a vial of poison and instructs him to drink or be shot. Should James decide to drink, his cause for suicide does not come from within but is imposed by an external force. Instead, death is the product of Alice's coercive choice. Rogers argues that a defendant who in\u00aficts physical or psychological trauma to bring about suicide forges a causative link between their wrongful act and the death. 132\u0001us , criminal causation is unbroken when suicide is the natural result of a defendant's action. 133 Say James jumped from a balcony to escape Alice but underestimated the height and died on impact. Surely the death is still attributed to her: but for Alice's violent conduct, neither the escape attempt nor death 131 Guinn (n 3) 445, 456. 132 Audrey Rogers, \u0091Death by Bullying: A Comparative Culpability Proposal\u0092 (2014) 35(1) Pace L Rev 343, 355\u009656. 133 ibid 356\u009657. 34 York Law Review would have occurred. Likewise, but for Alice's coercive choice, James would not have drunk the poison. Her wrongful acts provoked the suicide; she has caused the death and is responsible for homicide. If this was her intention, she is a murderer. \u0001ere is little domestic case law on this point, though there are several US cases that prove illuminative. In Stephenson v State , the grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan abducted, raped, and mutilated a woman who later died by suicide. 134\u0001e court held that the defendant subjected the victim to his absolute and inescapable control, which led to her believing she had no viable alternative to suicide. 135\u0001e circumstances imposed upon her by the defendant rendered her mentally irresponsible and, as suicide naturally followed, he could be guilty of murder. In State v Lassiter , the defendant tormented his victim to the point that she threatened to jump out of a window. \u0001e defendant 's conduct was said to impose a choice upon her: be beaten to death or suVer a swifter demise at her own hands. \u0001e court held that, by imposing this choice, the defendant caused the suicide and was properly convicted of murder. 136 Alice has imposed a similar choice on James. Should he decide poison is a preferable end to the bullet, this does not re\u00afect either his will or any authentic desire on his part. He submits rather than consents to her terms. \u0001e Court of Appeal distinguished between consent and submission in Olugboja . 137\u0001e defendant contested his conviction for rape on the grounds the victim verbally consented, even after being abducted and raped by the defendant's friend. \u0001e court held that the victim was so impaired by the ordeal she was unable to give consent ; instead, she oVered submission, which did not excuse the defendant. 138 Similarly, James submits to Alice's coercion by drinking the poison. His 134Stephenson v State 179 NE 633 (IN 1932). 135 Rogers (n 132) 359. 136State v Lassiter 197 NJ Super 2, 484 Volume \u0097 Spring 2021 act of compliance is not suYcient to break the causal chain and absolve Alice. She has caused his suicide, and ought to be liable for that as if she were a murderer. \u0001ose in Jonestown who were coerced are in the same position as James. A choice was imposed upon them by Jones where the only certainty is death. If they did not want to die, the case can be made that their suicides were caused by another's inescapable coercion. On this account, their decision to drink the poison is not an independent act but compliance extracted through coercion. \u0001us, the coerced have been murdered and, with nothing to break the causal link between Jones's coercive conduct and their deaths, he ought to be charged accordingly. 3.3 True Believers True believers are conceived as individuals who accepted Jones's narrative without question and drank the poison out of genuine fear of a dehumanising death. Likely, many of them were among those who thanked Jones for bringing them and their children peace. 139\u0001e extent of their uncritical devotion to Jones creates an instinct to group true believers alongside the robot-like members of the community, but this would be an oversimpli\u00aecation. It is argued that these individuals genuinely believed in Jim Jones, rather than forming such views due to the coercive persuasion . \u0001is distinction is inspired by Rebecca Moore, who describes discourse surrounding Jonestown as falling into the trap of casting everyone involved as a brainwashed cultist, with no thought spared for their humanity. 140\u0001us , in deference to the autonomy and humanity of the victims, it must be recognised some true believers may have retained volitional capacity and went to their deaths willingly. \u0001e liability arising because of their deaths is constructed on the basis 139 Guinn (n 3) 445\u009647. 140 Rebecca Moore, \u0091 \u0001e Stigmatized Deaths in Jonestown: a Locus for Grief \u0092 (2011) 35(1) Death Stud 42, 46. 36 York Law Review that, despite being capable of acting on their own volition, the reasons behind the act of suicide were fraudulent. \u0001ere were no fascists at the gate, no concentration camps, and no real chance of a dehumanising death. \u0001ey were driven to death by suicide on a false premise. It is on this basis that this article seeks to extend the principles of causation to recognise \u0091murder by deception\u0092. \u0001is is not a proposed change to the law; it is simply an attempt to explain how deceit induced suicide should be held to satisfy the actus reus of murder. 3.4 Deception Deception is an attack on autonomy, de\u00aened by Alexander and Sherwin as words or conduct to induce false beliefs in another. 141\u0001e victim is motivated to act on those false beliefs, meaning they are manipulated into serving the interests of a deceiver. 142 Shute and Horder conceptualise deception as being capable of overriding the victim's will, by denying them the opportunity to make an authentic choice. 143 Consider a father, trusted implicitly by his daughters, who raises them to believe their family has been targeted by neo-Nazis who will torture and kill them at the earliest opportunity. Eventually, he warns them the Nazis are searching the local area and recommends the girls hide in a panic room. Days later, the father announces they have been discovered and the Nazis are moments away from invading their sanctuary. Rather than face a dehumanising death at the hands of the Nazis, the family collectively agree suicide is preferable and take their own lives. As with the coerced, these daughters have had a choice imposed upon them by an external invader who ought to be liable for the resulting 141 Larry Alexander and Emily Sherwin, \u0091Deception in Morality and Law\u0092 (2003) 22 L & Phil 393, 393. 142 ibid 397. 143 Stephan Shute and Jeremy Horder, \u0001ey act autonomously, given the circumstances, although the circumstances are not autonomously chosen. However, this is not true if their reasons for acting are the result of deception. Say the father, for no good reason beyond a few days of peace, lied about the neo-Nazis to induce his daughters to hide in the panic room ; their decision is neither authentic nor autonomous. \u0001rough fear they have been manipulated into serving the wishes of their father. But this does not extend beyond their decision to hide. Should the Nazis arrive, the deception would not be intrinsic to their decision- making. \u0001e daughters could authentically and autonomously choose to die by suicide to avoid a dehumanising death. Say instead that the f ather is lying on the \u00aenal day; there is no external invader and no real cause for suicide. Deception is now intrinsic to the decision because they cannot authentically choose to avoid a dehumanising death. Suicide would occur independently of their will because the manipulation of their father undermines their status as autonomous moral agents. For Gardner, if a victim of deception would have chosen another course of action had they known the true facts, the deceit is so fundamental to their thought process that it makes the action involuntary. 144 Had the daughters known there was no real prospect of a neo-Nazi invasion, they would not have chosen to die. Consequently, the father's deception vitiates their will to suicide, prevents any exercise of autonomy, and renders the deaths involuntary. To understand why these actions are involuntary, consider the fact that the daughters chose to die in a world where neo-Nazis were about to break d own the door, but that was not the world they lived in. \u0001ere is no value to their compliance because there was never a real connection 144 Simon Gardner, \u0091Appreciating Olugboja\u0092 (1996) 16(3) LS 275, 287\u009688. 38 York Law Review between the desired outcome and the act itself. 145 Such deception, according to Herring, is egregious because the \u0091deceiver\u0092 usurps the victim's decision-making capacity and transforms them into an instrument of their own harm. 146\u0001e daughters have had their free will weaponised into carrying out their father's murderous intentions; they are but weapons by which he kills them. \u0001e father attracts the highest degree of culpability and murder becomes the most appropriate charge. Jim Jones is no less culpable. Jones depended on deception to create the illusion his followers were under threat and ritualised the practice of white nights to condition them to accept the necessity of revolutionary suicide. He created the necessary standard at which true believers knew they would be called upon to lay down their lives. Jones's exploitation of this standard saw the true believers die to escape a dehumanising death that did not exist in the world they lived in. True believers may have chosen to die rather than live in a world without the Peoples Temple, but that was not the choice they were given. \u0001e deaths were involuntary because Jones denied them the opportunity to make an informed choice, undermined their autonomy, and twisted their will. 3.5 Murder by Deception It is argued in this paper that a defendant who purposely causes suicide through deceit should be liable for murder. \u0001is liabil ity is constructed on the basis that the deception was the tool that caused the suicide. Factual causation for murder by deception should be satis\u00aeed by the defendant depriving the victim of a will to live. It is an extension of the principles used when suicide is caused by coercion. For ShaVer, if a defendant's wrongful conduct causes another to die by suicide, the 145 I Matthew Gibson, \u0091 Deceptive Sexual Relations: A \u0001eory of Criminal Liability \u0092 Spring 2021 victim's will is not a driving force behind their death. 147\u0001e defendant has transformed the victim into an instrument by which their murderous intentions are exercised, for which they ought to be culpable. 148 Jim Jones accomplished this by convincing those who trusted him that there was an imminent fascist invasion in which their homes would be destroyed, their children would be tortured, and all would be slaughtered. He made them believe they were in an utterly hopeless position, depriving them of the will to live. In the world they believed themselves to be in, they were faced with suicide or the utter devastation of everything they held dear. Of course, this was not the reality of their situation. But for Jones's deceptive conduct, there would have been no cause for suicide. If deceit has been intentionally used by a defendant to deprive the victim of a will to live, then they should be held as the factual cause of any resulting suicide. Murder by deception ought to provide an exception to the general rule that suicide is an intervening act that breaks the chain of causation. Zavala argues that the defendant who sets in motion a chain of events that results in suicide remains the factual and legal cause of death. 149 \u0001e defendant remains culpable because the victim 's suicide is not suYciently free or deliberate to break the chain of causation. 150\u0001is principle has been accepted in the United States. In People v Lewis , the victim was shot during an altercation and promptly cut their own throat. 151\u0001e court held that the death could still be attributed to the defendants because the wound they in\u00aficted was a signi\u00aecant contribution to the victim's decision to take their own life. \u0001eir 147 Catherine D ShaVer, \u0091Criminal Liability for Assisting Suicide\u0092 (1986) 86(2) Colum L 348, 364\u009666. 148 ibid 372\u009674. 149 Carla Zavala, (2016) Hall L Rev 297. 150 ibid 318. 151People v Lewis 124 Cal 551 (CA 1899). 40 York Law Review unlawful acts set in motion a chain that led to the death of another and, although they did not intend the victim to die, they were convicted of manslaughter. Domestic criminal law recognises that those who set in motion events that inevitably lead to death can be charged with murder; 152 the principle should not change when the victim is deceived into becoming an instrument of their own harm. \u0001is is eminently applicable for true believers whose suicides were not only inspired by deception but actively planned out. LaPalme asserts that the causal chain is only broken when the victim acts so suYciently out of the ordinary that it is no longer fair to say harm was caused by the defendant. 153 True believers had been rehearsed to expect suicide at a moment's notice; their obedience as a response to deception should not be suYciently unforeseeable as to break the chain of causation. \u0001is is particularly true of Jones, who used the white nights to ensure everyone would comply when the time came. It seems appropriate to argue Jim Jones was a substantial and operating cause of the true believers' decisions to die. \u0001eir deaths were caused by his deception; thus, he should be held as both the factual and legal cause of death. Deception was simply the weapon he used to facilitate the deaths of true believers and he should answer for that as if he had used any other tool. By interpreting the existing principles of criminal causation to recognise murder by deception, there is a case here to go before a jury. 152R v Church [1965] EWCA Crim 1, [1966] 1 QB 59. 153 Nicholas LaPalme, \u0091Michelle Carter and the Curious Case of Causation: How to Respond to a Newly Emerging Class of Suicide-Related Proceedings\u0092 (2018) 98(5) BUL \u0097 Spring 2021 4Conclusion To explore the criminal liabilities arising from the Port Kaituma Airstrip Shooting and Jonestown Massacre, this article considered each event in turn. \u0001e literature surrounding coercive persuasion was analysed, which demonstrated that the Red Brigade could be constructed as non-autonomous robot-like beings, incapable of criminal responsibility. Automatism was proposed as a legal defence to convey this non- autonomous state. \u0001e existing principles of causation could be extended to hold Jim Jones liable for the acts of his robot-like followers. If we consider that robots do not act independently, it is apparent that, but for Jones's orders, the Port Kaituma Airstrip Shooting would not have occurred. \u0001us, there is an unbroken causal link between his act and the murders. For the Jonestown Massacre, the victims were divided into three theoretical classes: robot-like beings, who automatically complied with the order to self- destruct; those who were coerced, who complied under threat; and true believers, who drank the poison out of genuine fear of the dehumanising death Jones deceived them into expecting. For each of these classes, a diVerent reasoning is required for the attribution of criminal liability. To conclude, the criminal law of England and Wales can adequately address the harms arising from the Port Kaituma Airstrip Shooting and the Jonestown Massacre. \u0001ere is a philosophical and doctrinal basis for extending the principles of causation, automatism, coercion, and deception to levy successive murder charges against Jim Jones. \u0001is is not unwarranted; the extreme facts of this extraordinary case study would have required an extraordinary legal response. Lessons Unlearned: Bloody Sunday and the Conduct of British Armed Forces in Con\u00afict Amy Maria Butler Abstract As one of our most important cultural, political, and legal resources, history can enrich our collective understanding of present events. Conversely, historical narratives can be manipulated to \u00aet a political agenda . \u0001is paper explores these issues with reference to Bloody Sunday, 30 January 1972. On this day, 13 civil rights demonstrators were killed in Derry, Northern Ireland, by a unit of the British Parachute Regiment . \u0001e report that followed the subsequent tribunal of inquiry justi\u00aeed the actions of the unit to produce propaganda against the Irish Republican Army. However, a second inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday was established to consider new, as well as historical, evidence, in order to develop an accurate account of the day. Based on this evidence, Lance Corporal F of the 1st Battalion of the British Parachute Regiment was charged in 2019 with murder and attempted murder on Bloody Sunday. Media outlets consequently perpetuated a narrative that there is a \u0091witch hunt\u0092 against British veterans for \u0091doing their job\u0092. \u0001is denial of military accountability has facilitated the British government's disregard of known abuses of civilians by the British Army during the Iraq War. \u0001is paper wi ll use the case of Lance Corporal F to demonstrate the complexity of crimes committed in con\u00afict and the extent to which new legislation, the Overseas Operations (Service Personnel and \u0003eterans) Act 2021, is insuYcient in providing the necessary temporal scope to investigate them. It will further argue that the British government remains committed to cultivating a \u0091culture of protection\u0092 for British armed forces personnel, in turn denying justice for unlawfully killed civilians. 43 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 1Introduction In 2010, the second tribunal of inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday, 30 th January 1972 concluded that there was a \u0091serious and widespread loss of \u00aere discipline\u0092 among the 1st Battalion of the Parachute Regiment of the British Army (1 Para). 1 On this day, a civil rights march through the Bogside area of Derry, Northern Ireland, was violently suppressed by 1 Para, whose actions resulted in the loss of thirteen lives. \u0001e evidence presented as part of th e second tribunal, which became known as the Saville Inquiry, led to charges being brought against Lance Corporal F (L/C F) for murder and attempted murder in 2019, more than 47 years after Bloody Sunday. 1\u0001ese charges fuelled a narrative, led by sections of the mainstream media and by senior members of the Conservative government, of a \u0091witch hunt\u0092 being perpetrated against British veterans of operations in Northern Ireland. 2\u0001e European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR) notes that this attitude has led to a political climate where allegations of war crimes perpetrated by British soldiers during the Iraq War are disregarded by the British government. 3\u0001e trauma experienced by victims of violence by state actors, as well as the eVects on their families, which is well-documented in the case of the Bloody Sunday families, continues to be dismissed politically in favour of 1 Northern Ireland Public Prosecution Service, \u0091Bloody Sunday Decisions Press Release \u0097 Principal Conclusions\u0092 ( Northern Ireland Public Prosecution Service , 2019) <https://www.ppsni.gov.uk/news-centre/bloody-sunday-decisions-press-release> accessed 3 January 2020. 2 HC Deb 11 March 2020, vol 673, col 126W. 3 \u0091ECCHR is an independent, non-pro\u00aet legal and educational organization dedicated to enforcing civil and human rights worldwide\u0092 \u0097 European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights, \u0091Who We Are\u0092 (European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights) <https://www.ecchr.eu/en/about- us/> accessed 3 April 2020; ECCHR, War Crimes by UK Forces in Iraq: Follow-Up Communication by the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights to the OYce of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ECCHR 2019) 21. 44 \u0002ork Law Review preventing reputational damage to the British armed forces. 4\u0001e validity of such an interpretation is illustrated by the recent protests against the notice of L/C F's prosecution by thousands of retired soldiers, who collectively asserted that armed forces personnel should not be prosecuted for \u0091doing their job\u0092. 5 2\u0001e History of Bloody Sunday \u0001e history of Bloody Sunday requires exploration to understand the brutal and complex nature of the Northern Irish con\u00afict, of which there are conventionally two sides \u0097 Catholic Nationalists, who endorsed a united Ireland, and Protestant Loyalists, who favoured uni\u00aecation with Britain. 6 Of the paramilitary organisations that sought to represent each group, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) arguably remains the most well-known. 7 Together with Loyalist paramilitaries and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), the British Army was 4 After hearing the PPS decision to prosecute only one member of 1 Para on Bloody Sunday, the families released a joint statement noting that the event in 1972 created \u0091a deep legacy of hurt and injustice and deepened and prolonged a bloody con\u00afict \u0092; Owen Bowcott, \u0091\u0093People Were Devastated\u0094: Relatives of Bloody Sunday \u0003ictims on the Charge\u0092 \u0003e Guardian (London, 14 March 2019) <https://www.theguardian.com/uk- news/2019/mar/14/people-were-devastated-relatives-of-bloody-sunday-victims-on- 4 April 2020. 5 Dominic Nicholls, \u0091 \u0001ousands of Retired Soldiers Protest through London over Charging of Soldier F for Bloody Sunday Murders\u0092 \u0003e Telegraph (London, 12 April 2019) <https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/04/12/thousands-retired-soldiers- protest-central-london-motorbikes/> accessed 15 March 2020. 6 Whilst this paper solely discusses the two sides of the con\u00afict, it should be noted that there were Protestants who favoured a United Ireland and Catholics who favoured the union with Britain; Samantha Anne Caesar, \u0091Captive or Criminal?

All but two of the protesters were Catholic. 19 As this example coveys, internment without trial purposefully criminalised the Catholic Nationalist community.

Of these, the second inquiry's \u00aendings will be examined to explore the events of the day, which saw the \u0091largest single loss of life\u0092 incurred throughout the course of the Troubles. 22 On the morning of Sunday, 30 January 1972, the NICRA marched through the Bogside area of the city of Derry, protesting against the British Army's use of internment without trial. 23 As the march proceeded through William Street, \u0091rioting broke out in the form of members of the crowd throwing stones\u0092 at the British Army. 24 Under the provisions of the 1922 Act, the NICRA's march was illegal. 25 \u0001is provided a basis for military intervention, with the troops initially responding with baton rounds. 26\u0001e director of operations, Brigadier MacLellan, intervened, authorising Colonel Wilford, commander of 1 Para, to send \u0091one subunit\u0092 of paratroopers to the outskirts of the Bogside. \u0001e unit were tasked with conducting the arrests of rioters, but MacLellan explicitly stipulated that 1 Para \u0091must not conduct running battle down Rossville Street\u0092. \u0001is order was, however, rejected by Wilford, who, according to the Saville Report, believed that the soldiers were trained to \u0091seek out the \u0093enemy\u0094 aggressively, and not behave like 21 Robert White, \u0091From Peaceful Protest to Guerrilla War: Micromobilization of the Provisional Irish Republican Army\u0092 (1989) 94(6) Am J Sociology 1277, 1289. 22 Hegarty (n 10) 202. 23 Walsh, Bloody Sunday and the Rule of Law in Northern Ireland (n 11) 7. 24Principal Conclusions (n 1) 14. 25 Caesar (n 6) 333. 26Principal Conclusions (n 1) 14. 48 York Law Review \u0093Aunt Sallies\u0094\u0092. 27 Instead, Wilford deployed one company of 1 Para through Barrier 14 onto William Street, followed by a second company in vehicles through Little James Street, resulting in a chase down Rossville Street and subsequently into the Bogside, where rioters and demonstrators were indistinguishable. 28\u0001is movement resulted in a panicked chase. \u0001e predetermined arrest operation became impossible \u0097 rioters and demonstrators intermingled in the chaos, resulting, as the Saville Report highlights, in every civilian in the Bogside becoming \u0091the enemy\u0092. 29 \u0001e Saville Report provides a detailed account of what happened in the minutes following the chase. In the car park of the Rossville Flats, Jack Duddy was mortally shot as he \u0091[ran] away from the soldiers\u0092 and six other civilians were wounded. 30 Soon after, Hugh Gilmour, William Nash, John Young, Michael McDaid, and Kevin McElhinney were shot dead, and Nash's father, Alexander, was injured. 31 Like Duddy, Gilmour was shot as he was running away from the soldiers and McElhinney was shot as he crawled to safety. 32 Four members of 1 Para arrived in Glenfada Park North, where they shot two more men: Jim Wray, who was shot a second time \u0091when he was lying mortally wounded on the ground\u0092, and William McKinney. 33 A further four men were injured in this area, one of whom was aged 16. 34 One soldier left 27 Mark Saville, William L Hoyt, and John L Toohey, Report of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry (vol 8, Stationery O\u0002ce 2010) 571. 28 ibid 576.

Prior to the beginning of the Tribunal's proceedings, Heath instructed Widgery that, whilst presiding over the inquiry, he should \u0091never forget it is a propaganda war we are \u00aeghting\u0092. 54 Published in April 1972, ten weeks after Bloody Sunday, Lord Widgery's report seemingly accommodated PM Heath's instruction. 49 HC Deb 31 Jan 1972, vol 830, col 33. 50ibid; Hegarty (n 1 0) 199. 51 George Gilligan and John Pratt (eds), Crime, Truth and Justice: O\u0003cial Inquiry, Discourse, Knowledge (Willan 2004) 63. 52 Widgery (n 48) 3. 53 Hegarty (n 10) 212. 54 Museum of Free Widgery ) <https://www.museumoVreederry.org/content/%E2%80%98widgery-memo-damns- british%E2%80%99> accessed 19 January 2020. 52 York Law Review Whilst the document concluded that none of the deceased men were handling \u00aerearms at the time they were shot by 1 Para, the Widgery Report found that the deceased men had most likely possessed \u00aerearms at undetermined times during the march on Bloody Sunday. 55 In actuality, the only man with a weapon shot by 1 Para was Donaghey, who was found with four nail bombs in his pockets. 56 It was alleged to the Tribunal by some attendees of the march that these weapons were planted on his body by British Army personnel after he was shot. However, this testimony was disregarded by Widgery with the incident reported in the report as \u0091mere speculation\u0092. 57\u0001is, and the suggestion that the deceased men were in possession of \u00aerearms, was found by Widgery to be one of the principal justi\u00aecations of 1 Para opening \u00aere. \u0001is contrasts strongly with the \u00aendings of the subsequent Saville Inquiry, published some 38 years after Widgery, which determined that the bombs were not visible to either the soldier that shot Donaghey or the medical o\u0002cers that subsequently aided him. Further, the Saville Report contradicted the conclusions of Widgery, vindicating the rest of the deceased men by asserting that they had not wielded \u00aerearms during the march on Bloody Sunday. 58 Despite the Widgery Report portraying the deceased men as \u0091hooligans\u0092, it went on to conclude that the men killed were \u0091not acting aggressively and the shots were \u00aered without justi\u00aecation\u0092. 59\u0001is statement ostensibly implicates the s oldiers as acting unlawfully. However, one of the report's central contradictions was its further statement that \u0091there was no general breakdown in discipline\u0092 on the part of 1 Para, further complexifying the issue of apportioning blame as the report seemingly vindicates both 1 Para and the deceased men. \u0001e report's obfuscation has provoked academic speculation that Widgery was acting to sustain the British government 55 Widgery (n 48) 28\u009630. 56Principal Conclusions (n 1) 32. 57 Widgery (n 48) 32\u009633. 58 Widgery (n 48) 32. 59 Widgery (n 48) 53 \u0001 Army's \u0091concoction deceit\u0092. 60 \u0001ese examples combine to indicate, as Gilligan note d, that the British government in 1972 had a desire to document a \u0091self-serving version of the truth\u0092. 61\u0001is was demonstrated by the Widgery Report 's clear conclusion that there would have been no fatalities had the NICRA not organised the march. 62 By \u00aending that NICRA were responsible for the events of Bloody Sunday, the Widgery Report demonised the civil rights movement and signalled to Nationalists in Northern Ireland that their right to protest against oppressive measures would be met with fatal force and further validated in o\u0002cial discourse. 63\u0001is version of the \u0091truth\u0092 perpetuated by the Widgery Report was presented to the House of Commons on 19 April 1972 by PM Heath. 64 However, it was rebutted by Frank McManus MP as a \u0091whitewash\u0092 of the \u0091activities of the Army on that Sunday\u0092. 65\u0001is was also echoed in the literature, as Dawson states that by not exercising the evidential scope provided by the Tribunals of Inquiry Act 1921 to thoroughly investigate the events of Bloody Sunday, nor holding the 1 Para to account, the tribunal's conclusions amounted to a \u0091denial of justice\u0092. 66 4\u0001e Second Inquiry \u0097 \u0001e Saville Report \u0001e inconsistencies and partial investigations of the Widgery Tribunal have led scholars such as Hegarty to contend that the mechanism was ultimately used as a political tool by Heath's government to prevent \u0091the 60 Widgery (n 48) 38; Don Mullan, Eyewitness: Bloody Sunday (3rd edn Wolfhound Press 1997) 219. 61Crime, Truth and Justice (n 53) 65. 62 Widgery (n 48) 38. 63 Hegarty (n 11) 222. 64 HC Deb 19 April 1972, vol 835, col 519. 65 HC Deb 19 April 1972, vol 835, col 526. 66 Graham Dawson, \u0091Trauma, Place and the Politics of Memory: Bloody Sunday, Derry, 1972\u00962004\u0092 (2005) 59(1) History Workshop Journal 151, 163. 54 York Law Review truth of the events emerging\u0092. 67 Naturally, this discouraged public trust in the British justice system across the United Kingdom.

Before its commencement, PM Blair stated that, in order to succeed, the tribunal needed to consider both the evidence originally presented by the 1972 Widgery Tribunal and the documents raised in the Irish government's dossier. 76 Seeking to address one of the principal criticisms of Widgery \u0097 its partial investigations \u0097 Blair stipulated that the second inquiry must dedicate a su\u0002cient period of time in which to thoroughly investigate the available evidence. 77 Second, an important factor in instigating the Saville Inquiry was the disparity in nature of the legal representation of the families of those who died on Bloody Sunday and the soldiers in the Widgery Tribunal. 78 Across ten volumes, the Saville Report outlined the judicial processes adopted by the inquiry, which were designed to facilitate balanced legal representation between the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the Bloody Sunday familie s. \u0001 e literature highlights that the adversarial nature of legal representation at the Widgery Inquiry, where the MoD's legal assets far outweighed those of the \u0091under-resourced\u0092 Bloody Sunday families, prompted this provision. 79\u0001e Saville Inquiry sought to ensure that all parties had \u0091con\u00aedence in the inquiry\u0092 by having the capacity to thoroughly explore the events of 30 January 1972. 80 75 HC Deb 29 Jan 1998, vol 305, col 503. 76 ibid. 77\u0001e introductory volume of the Saville Report echoed Blair's instruction by outlining the necessity of time in the collection, analysis, hearing, and consideration of the evidence, which is voluminous.

Consecu tive PMs \u0001eresa May and Boris Johnson have endorsed a statutory \u0091presumption against prosecution\u0092 for British soldiers for \u0091alleged oVences committed in the course of duty\u0092, validating a political climate where accountability for alleged war crimes perpetrated by British soldiers is unimportant. 93 It can be inferred from the resistance of successive UK prime ministers to criticise British soldiers that supporting justice for unlawfully killed civilians is not politically viable, which is illustrated by the current controversy surrounding retrospective prosecutions of L/C F. 88Principal Conclusions (n 1) 53. 89 Widgery (n 48) 38, 69\u009682. 90 Aiken (n 83) 112. 91 Museum of Free Derry, \u0091Bloody Sunday Trust \u0097 Innocent: Remembering 15 June \u0097 Reactions to the Saville Report on Bloody Sunday\u0092 (Derry, 2011). 92 HC Deb 15 June 2010, vol 305. 93 Boris Johnson is the PM of the United Kingdom from 2019 to the present (as of April 2021 ); Overseas Operations (Service Personnel and \u0003eterans) Act 2021; ECCHR (n 3) 43. 58 York Law Review 52019: \u0001e Charges Against L/C F and 1 Para \u0001e scope of the two tribunals discussed thus far, Widgery and Saville, were governed by the Tribunals of Inquiry Act 1921. 94 According to Blom-Cooper, this Act eVectively limited the jurisdiction of the Inquiries to truth-\u00aending initiatives. 95 Despite the Saville Report being unambiguous in its \u00aendings regarding 1 Para's misconduct, both the Widgery and Saville Tribunals lacked the inherent jurisdiction to rule on civil or criminal liability. 96\u0001e authority to bring public prosecutions rests with the Northern Ireland Public Prosecution Service (PPS), which has the authority to infer \u00aendings of criminal or civil liability from the evidence presented in the Saville Report for the Bloody Sunday killings. 97 In 2019, the PPS announced that there was su\u0002cient evidence to prosecute L/C F for murder and attempted murder. 98\u0001is section of the paper will focus on the charges against L/C F as the only member of 1 Para being charged for his actions on Bloody Sunday. Whilst the British Army personnel active in Northern Ireland were \u0091constitutionally the responsibility of the MoD in London\u0092, the Northern Irish courts take legal responsibility for prosecuting the soldiers involved in Operation Banner. 99\u0001is section of discussion considers the legal precedents for unlawful force in\u00aficted by British Army personnel on military operations in Northern Ireland.

Upon appeal, the House of Lords upheld the murder conviction, holding that the defendant was guilty of murder because he had exhibited a \u0091grossly excessive and disproportionate use of force\u0092 that refutes the claim of self-defence. 103 Several aspects of Clegg are pertinent in the context of Bloody Sunday. First, 1 Para claimed to both tribunals that they used lethal force in response to being \u00aered upon \u00aerst, which was untrue, and thus the notion of coercive action and self-defence cannot be engaged. Second, it suggests that 1 Para ought to be judged in a court of law on the same criterion for murder as an ordinary citizen. \u0001is requires the actus reus and mens rea to be determined. For the prosecution of L/C F to succeed, it must be determined that he had the intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm under the Queen's peace. 104 Using primarily the Saville Report, the following discussions seek to understand the extent to which the actions of 1 Para, and L/C F in particular, constitute murder. In March 2019, 47 years after Bloody Sunday, the PPS charged L/C F with the murder of James Wray and William McKinney and the 100R v Clegg [1995] UKHL 1, [1995] 1 ibid (Lord Lloyd). 102 ibid 497 (Lord Lloyd). 103 ibid 489 (Lord Lloyd). 104 3 Co Inst 47. 60 York Law Review attempted murder of Patrick O'Donnell, Joseph Friel, Joe Mahon, and Michael Quinn. \u0001is is based on evidence from eye witness testimonies and forensic data incriminating 1 Para collectively. 105 Based upon this evidence, provided to the Saville Inquiry by the Irish government, Walsh suggests that 1 Para may have acted in a joint enterprise to commit murder and attempted murder on Bloody Sunday. 106 Further, the report considered evidence that L/C F was responsible for killing three more men and grievously harming two others, which is not re\u00afected in the charges brought against him by the PPS. 107\u0001e charges made, and not made, against L/C F by the PPS will be explored below in conjunction with an evidenced discussion of the possibility of a joint enterprise between 1 Para. \u0001e report states that in an area of the Bogside, namely Glenfada Park North, either L/C F or Private H, another member of 1 Para, \u0091\u00aered the shot that mortally wounded William McKinney\u0092. 108\u0001e report stated that \u0091each hit McKinney with one shot\u0092 in the back, one of which passed through his body and hit Joe Mahon. 109 In their decision not to prosecute Private H, the PPS noted that \u0091there was no admissible evidence to prove\u0092 that he \u00aered his weapon in Glenfada Park North, thus attributing the murder of McKinney and attempted murder of Mahon to L/C F. 110\u0001e second count of murder attributed to L/C F by the PPS is that of Jim Wray. 111 Despite Saville concluding that either Private G or H \u00aered the \u00aerst shot to hit Wray, not L/C F, the report noted 105Principal Conclusions (n 1). 106 Walsh, Bloody Sunday and the Rule of Law in Northern Ireland (n 11) 160. 107Principal Conclusions (n 1) 30\u009657. 108Principal Conclusions (n 1) 34. 109 Lord Saville, William L Hoyt, and John L Toohey, Sector 4: Events in Glenfada Park North and Abbey Park (vol 6, Stationery O\u0002ce 2010) 584\u009685. 110 Northern Ireland Public Prosecution Service, Bloody Sunday \u0097 Summary of Decisions Not to Prosecute (Northern Ireland Public Prosecution Service 2019) 11 <https://www.ppsni.gov.uk/publications/bloody-sunday-summary-reasons> accessed 20 March 2020. 111 ibid. 61 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 that, between L/C F and three other members of the unit, they killed McKinney and Wray, and injured Mahon, Friel, Quinn, and O'Donnell. 112\u0001e implication of a joint enterprise between the soldiers of 1 Para is considered in the literature. Walsh, for example, hypothesises that even if it cannot be established which paratrooper discharged fatal rounds in the Bogside, the group of soldiers may all be criminally liable if they were aware that one or more of them was contemplating the use of unlawful lethal force. 113\u0001e actions of 1 Para on Bloody Sunday can be considered against the precedent of joint enterprise's wider case law. Joint Enterprise between 1 Para According to the case law of the UK's Supreme Court, the expression \u0091joint enterprise\u0092 is \u0091not a legal term of art\u0092. 114 Outlined in R v Jogee , it is a doctrine that accords responsibility if several parties agree to carry out a criminal venture. 115 As the judgment states, each party is therefore \u0091liable for acts to which they have expressly or impliedly given their assent\u0092. 116 When applied to the context of Bloody Sunday, the principle of joint enterprise is engaged if one soldier committed the act of murder against a civilian but several other soldiers encouraged or facilitated it. According to the precedent set forth in Jogee , this would be an act of joint enterprise whereby the \u00aerst soldier was the \u0091principal\u0092 oVender 112Principal Conclusions (n 1) 34\u009643. 113 Walsh, Bloody Sunday and the Rule of Law in Northern Ireland (n 11) 160. 114R v Jogee [2016] UKSC 8, Lord Toulson SCJJ). Jogee was a landmark ruling which set a precedent on defendants being convicted as accessories to an oVence if they acted to \u0091aid, abet, counsel, or procure\u0092 the commission of a crime with the intent to do so. Explained in depth and with examples in Jessica Jacobson and others, \u0091Joint Enterprise: Righting a Wrong Turn? Report of an Exploratory Study\u0092 (Institute for Criminal Policy Research, University of London, 2016). 115 ibid. 116 ibid. 62 York Law Review and the others were \u0091secondary\u0092 oVenders. 117 When considered together with the evidentiary language of the Saville Report, Walsh's contention of a joint enterprise between four members of 1 Para to murder two civilians and injure a further four addresses the con\u00aficting charges brought against L/C F for actions he alone did not commit. For L/C F and his cohort to have been acting in a joint enterprise, it must be determined that they had a common pursuit that caused the deaths in the Bogside. 118 Across the extensive documentation that comprises the Saville Report, there are a number of instances where the shared intent of 1 Para is evidently discernible. In one example, the report describes how the soldiers would have been \u0091highly apprehensive\u0092, if not \u0091frightened\u0092 that they were going to come under \u0091attack by paramilitaries using bombs and \u00aerearms\u0092. 119\u0001e possibility that 1 Para were therefore mentally prepared for con\u00afict, rather than conducting an arrest operation, is further evidenced in other sections of the r eport. \u0001is mentality was exacerbated by General Ford, the most senior British Army commander in Northern Ireland at the time of Bloody Sunday, who is reported as having incited a sense of \u0091war-zone urgency\u0092 in 1 Para as the soldiers entered the Bogside, shouting \u0091Go on the Paras, go and get them, go on, go and get them\u0092. 120\u0001e report goes on to criticise the unit's commander, Wilford, because he ordered 1 Para into the Bogside to \u0091as he himself put it, seek out the \u0093enemy\u0094\u0092. 121 Drawing upon these accounts, it could be suggested that senior members of the British Army encouraged 1 Para to act outside their duty, and in doing so committed gross negligence in their incitement of a foreseeably 117 ibid [78] (Lord Hughes and Lord Toulson (Lord Hughes and Lord Toulson SCJJ). 119Principal Conclusions (n 1) 39. 120 British Irish Rights Watch, \u0091Bloody Sunday: Submission to the United Nations' Special Rapporteur on Summary and Arbitrary Executions: the Murder of 13 Civilians by Soldiers of the British Army on \u0093Bloody Sunday\u0094 30th January 1972\u0092 (CAIN Web Service, 1994) <https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/events/bsunday/birw.htm> accessed 13 March 2020. 121Principal Conclusions (n 1) 53. 63 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 deadly environment on Bloody Sunday. 122 Once deployed, the members of 1 Para \u0091reacted by losing their self-control forgetting or ignoring their instructions and training\u0092. 123 It can be concluded that the common pursuit between 1 Para, encouraged by senior o\u0002cers, ful\u00aels the criterion of a joint enterprise by the soldiers and their superiors on Bloody Sunday. It is also crucial to the ful\u00aelment of the criteria for joint enterprise that at least one of the victims was killed unlawfully. 124\u0001roughout their involvement in the Northern Ireland con\u00afict, the British Army used the Yellow Card, which set out the conditions of permissibility for British soldiers to discharge weapons. \u0001ese conditions stipulated that soldiers must not use more force than necessary and to only \u00aere without warning when a person can be \u0091positively identi\u00aeed\u0092 as carrying a weapon. 125 According to Mills, contravention of these rules amounted to unlawful use of force. 126 As preceding sections have discussed, one of the principal conclusions of the Saville Report was that 1 Para shot at civilians without warning, when those civilians were not armed and were ultimately not posing a discernible threat. 127\u0001ese \u00aendings, surmises Walsh, indicate that 1 Para were \u0091in breach of the Yellow Card rules\u0092 when they allegedly resorted to the unlawful use of lethal force during the events of Bloody Sunday. 128 Whilst a joint pursuit can be inferred from 1 Para's actions on Bloody Sunday, it can be further solidi\u00aeed in their perjured statements to the Widgery Tribunal. 129\u0001e Saville Report concluded that the soldiers of 122Principal Conclusions (n 1) 57. 123Principal Conclusions (n 1) 53. 124 Walsh, Bloody Sunday and the Rule of Law in Northern Ireland (n 11) 207. 125 Claire Mills, \u0091Investigation of Former Armed Forces Personnel Who Served in Northern Ireland\u0092 (CBP 8352, 2020) 12\u009614. 126 ibid 14. 127Principal Conclusions (n 1) 35. 128 Walsh, Bloody Sunday and the Rule of Law in Northern Ireland (n 11) 207\u009608. 129Events in Glenfada Park North and Abbey Park (n 109) 577\u009689. 64 York Law Review 1 Para sought to provide \u0091knowingly\u0092 false accounts to both of the Tribunals in an attempt to justify \u00aering their weapons. 130 Illustratively, L/C F claimed that he had shot at least two men on the streets of the Bogside because he identi\u00aeed them as having a \u00aerearm on Bloody Sunday. \u0001e report did not \u00aend this testimony su\u0002ciently compelling, however, and ultimately determined that L/C F shot unjusti\u00aeably at civilians without \u0091caring\u0092 whether their behaviour was threatening or not. 131 In the wider context of the perjured statements from 1 Para to the inquiries, the Saville Report suggests the possibility that the soldiers \u0091invented details\u0092 in an attempt to make claims of gunmen in the Bogside more credible. 132 Such obfuscation means that responsibility for a number of deaths and injuries cannot be attributed to any one soldier. 133 It is possible that, in taking such steps to mislead the inquiries, members of 1 Para sought to protect one another from incrimination . \u0001e development of such a \u0091culture of protection\u0092 meant that, as the Saville Report acknowledged, British soldiers in Northern Ireland felt they could \u0091\u00aere with impunity\u0092, secure in the knowledge that possible investigation by the RUC or Royal Military Police would be undertaken sympathetically. 134 As the preceding paragraphs have sought to present, 1 Para worked in joint enterprise to cause death and grievous bodily harm on Bloody Sunday. \u0001e paper will now consider the extent to which this has informed the pursuit of legal justice against members of 1 Para. \u0001e only charges being brought against the unit are against L/C F, for which he is yet to stand trial. \u0001e test for prosecution cannot be applied to two members of the joint enterprise because they are deceased, and there is insu\u0002cient evidence to charge the fourth member. 135 However, whilst 130Principal Conclusions (n 1) 38. 131Principal Conclusions (n 1) 42\u009657. 132Report of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry (vol 1) (n 78) 80. 133Principal Conclusions (n 1) 33\u009644. 134Principal Conclusions (n 1) 50. 135Summary of Decisions Not to Prosecute (n 110) 11. 65 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 the Saville Report had \u0091no doubt\u0092 that L/C F was responsible for the deaths of Kelly, Doherty, and McGuigan, as well as causing injury to two other men, the PPS charges against L/C F do not re\u00afect this. 136 According the PPS, there was insu\u0002cient forensic evidence to ascribe the death of Kelly to L/C F and any accounts of the soldier \u00aering in this area were rendered inadmissible due to the unit's perjury. 137 It was also for this reason that L/C F could not be charged with the murder of McGuigan and Doherty. 138 Evidential issues are not the only challenges that the PPS faced in their decision to charge L/C F. In their recent report, entitled Historical Investigation & Information Recovery , the Commission for \u0003ictims and Survivors determined that the central issue facing contemporary investigations into historical events is the passage of time. 139\u0001e report notes that witnesses to events under investigation may be deceased. In the case of Bloody Sunday, both of these challenges are evident. 140 However, according to the literature, this reluctance to begin criminal proceedings was outweighed by three factors: \u00aerst, the seriousness of the oVence; second, the delay in crimina l proceedings caused by 1 Para's perjury and the British government in 1972 by imploring Widgery to produce a form of propaganda against the IRA; and , third, the PPS determining that the evidence against L/C F proved \u0091beyond reasonable doubt\u0092 that he committed an oVence and were also satis\u00aeed that it satis\u00aeed the public interest. 141 However indisputable the evidence against L/C F may be, there remains a section of society that does not 136Principal Conclusions (n 1) 34\u0096 45; Summary of Decisions Not to Prosecute (n 110) 9. 137 ibid. 138 ibid. 139\u0001e Commission for \u0003ictims and Survivors & Deloitte, Research on Historical Investigations & Information Recovery (Commission for \u0003ictims and Survivors 2012) 8\u00969. 140 ibid. 141Report of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry (vol 10) (n 81) 38\u0096 45; Museum of Free Derry (n 54) ; Northern Irela nd Public Prosecution Service, Code for Prosecutors (Northern Ireland Public Prosecution Service) 16. 66 York Law Review wish for the British Army to be held to account. \u0001is will be explored in the succeeding paragraphs using the examples of the reluctance of Conservative PMs to condemn British Army personnel for human rights abuses in Northern Ireland and Iraq. 6Opposition to the Good Friday Agreement and Prosecution of Operation Banner Veterans In recent years, public distaste for charges brought against veterans of Northern Ireland has grown across the UK. In 2019, thousands of retired soldiers marched to protest the charges for murder and attempted murder on Bloody Sunday brought against L/C F. 142\u0001is protest reinvigorated conversations about a number of grievances that emerged from the signing of the Good Friday Agreement (GFA) in 1998. 143 In particular, these concerns centred around the absence of a formal mechanism for dealing with unresolved deaths of those killed in PIRA attacks. 144\u0001is is because some communities, most notably British Army veterans, believe that, whilst Northern Irish civilians killed by British forces have received a large-scale inquiry and public apology by a British PM, the same will not be aVorded to those whose lives were lost in paramilitary attacks. Lukowiak notes that it is for the aforementioned reason that the GFA was not received positively by Northern Ireland veterans, who considered it an institutional betrayal 142 Nicholls (n 6). 143 The GFA was signed on 10 April 1998 by the British and Irish Governments and most of the political parties in Northern Ireland. The Agreement comprises three strands: i) the structure of the democratic institutions in Northern Ireland; ii) the relationship between the North and Republic of Ireland; and iii) the relationship between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. It also includes sections addressing constitutional issues, rights, decommissioning of arms, security, policing and prisoners; see Northern Ireland Office, The Belfast Agreement (Cm 3883, 1998). 144 Mills (n 125) 15. 67 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 by the British government. 145 Further, there are grievances around the inter-group consensus between the British and Irish governments, which implored PM Blair to authorise the early release of political prisoners to encourage IRA disarmament. 146\u0001is, Neuman n argues, was a miscalculation because the British government weakened popular support for the GFA by compromising on a \u0091\u0093powerful incentive\u0094\u0092 for the IRA to make their peaceful means permanent\u0092. 147 It can be argued that the public receptiveness towards the prosecution of Northern Ireland veterans across the United Kingdom has been aVected by the compromises made in the GFA. 148 Recognising the contentious nature of retrospective prosecution for British Army personnel, the trial of L/C F, if it takes places, represents a signi\u00aecant moment for the enactment of post-con\u00afict peace and justice in Northern Ireland. As Aiken observes, the case may provide an opportunity for intercommunity reconciliation for Nationalists and Loyalists as truth and justice can \u0091end impunity for past abuses\u0092. 149 Further, the trial would demonstrate the capacity of the justice system to champion the rule of law to overcome temporal and political adversity. \u0001e legal journey of the Bloody Sunday charges in 2019 from the event in 1972 highlights the extent to which political agendas can both interrupt and in\u00afuence investigative processes. 150 However, lessons have not been learned. In 2019, the Conservative government proposed legislative protection for British military personnel in Iraq 145 Ken Lukowiak, \u0091Bloody Sunday and the Paras' Guilt\u0092 \u0002e Gu ardian (London, 18 June 2010) <https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree//jun/18/bloody-sunday- paratrooper-apology> accessed 27 November 2019. 146 Donald Horowitz, \u0091 \u0001e Northern Ireland Agreement: Clear Consociational, and Risky\u0092 in John McGarry (ed), Northern Ireland and the Divided World: Post- Agreement Northern Ireland in Comparative Perspective (OUP 2001) 101. 147 Peter Neumann, \u0091 \u0001e Government's Respo nse\u0092 in James Dingley (ed), Combating Terrorism in Northern Ireland (Cass Series on Political \u0003iolence, Routledge 2008) 193. 148 ibid. 149 Aiken (n 83) 108. 150 Aiken (n 83) 108. 68 York Law Review against \u0091vexatious\u0092 claims of liability. 151\u0001e legislation arguably represents a legal manifestation both of the \u0091culture of protection\u0092 that continues to surround the British Army and an entrenched governmental reluctance to hold state forces to account. Catalysed by an unprecedented number of legal claims for damages during military operations in Iraq, the Overseas Operations (Service Personnel and \u0003eterans) Act 2021 was proposed and has subsequently been enacted. 152 Whilst the Act does not apply to the events of the Troubles, it seems likely that the British government will introduce similar legislation to address the statutory gap between legacy issues in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Troubles in Northern Ireland. 153 7Parallels between the Overseas Operations (Service Personnel and Veterans) Act 2021 and the Widgery Report \u0001e Saville Report is considered representative of considerable progress made in the championing of truth recovery initiatives in the UK. 154 However, the Act as it now stands is counterproductive to this progress. \u0001e legislation sti\u00afes the possibility of historical investigation into claims of civilians unlawfully killed or tortured by Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. In 2019, a joint investigation conducted by BBC Panorama and \u0002e Sunday Times reported that the British government and Army had covered up war crimes perpetrated by British soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. 155\u0001e investigation reported a source at the now -defunct 151Conservative Manifesto (\u0001e Conservative and Unionist Party 2019) 52. 152 Explanatory Notes to the Overseas Operations (Service Personnel and \u0003eterans) Act 2021. 153 Mills (n 125) 7. 154 John Brewer and Bernadette Hayes, \u0091\u0003ictimhood and Attitudes towards Dealing with the Legacy of a \u0003iolent Past: Northern Ireland as a Case Study\u0092 (2015) 17(3) Brit J Poli 513. 155 Editorial, \u0091UK Government and Military Accused of War Crime Cover-Up\u0092 BBC (London, 17 November 2019) <https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50419297> accessed 2 69 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT), stating that the MoD \u0091had no intention of prosecuting any soldier\u0092 unless \u0091they couldn't wriggle their way out of it\u0092. 156 If true, such institutional denial of accountability arguably serves as a contemporary manifestation of the culture of protection, reminiscent of the lack of parliamentary oversight when PM Heath presented the \u00aendings of the Widgery Report to the House of Commons without providing copies to other members of the House. 157 \u0001e closure of IHAT, tasked with investigating allegations of human rights abuses by British Army personnel in Iraq, suggests the continuation of the denial of military accountability by the British government. 158\u0001e ECCHR suggested that, whilst allegations of abuse of Iraqi detainees have indeed been acknowledged by chief Army advisers and British politicians, IHAT's closure represented a failure in obtaining justice for those subjected to abuse by British armed forces. 159 In an attempt to hold the UK to account for this failure, the ECCHR invited the International Criminal Court 160 to investigate the alleged crimes committed by British forces during the Iraq War. 161 Despite these movements, the British government remains insistent that the claims of abuse of Iraqi detainees are \u0091without foundation\u0092. 162\u0001is continued stance has been interpreted by the ECCHR as an institutional April 2020. 156 Closed by the Secretary of State for Defence in 2017 amidst \u0091domestic political pressure \u0092; European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (n 3) 45. 157 HC Deb 19 April 1972, vol 835, col 521. 158 European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights, \u0091War Crimes by UK Forces in Iraq: Q & A on the Legal Basis\u0092 (updated December 2020, Berlin) 1. 159 European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (n 3) 21. 160 \u0091 \u0001e International Criminal Court (ICC) investigates and, where warranted, tries individuals charged with the gravest crimes of concern to the international community: genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression \u0092; International Criminal Court, About the Court <https://www.icc-cpi.int/about> accessed 2 February 2021. 161 \u0091War Crimes by UK Forces in Iraq: Q & A on the Legal Basis\u0092 (n 158) 2. 162 European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (n 4) 43. 70 York Law Review reluctance to investigate British armed forces. 163 In an address to the House of Commons, PM Boris Johnson stated that it \u0091cannot be right that people should face unfair prosecutions when no new evidence has been forthcoming\u0092. 164\u0001is sentiment has translated into Section 2, Part 1 of the Act which names a \u0091presumption against prosecution\u0092. 165 For this presumption to be ful\u00aelled, a number of conditions must be met: \u00aerst, the person must be a member of the armed forces, deployed overseas at the time of the alleged conduct ; and, second, it must have been no longer than \u00aeve years since the conduct took place. 166\u0001e inclusion of an expiration date has speci\u00aec implications for historical investigation. It places pressure on victims of violence in con\u00afict to cooperate at the time of the event, which may not be possible. Rourke's research can be used to suggest that statutory expiration dates do not allow for the existence of a psychological phenomenon; it excludes those experiencing \u0091amnesia and delayed recall for some memories\u0092 as a consequence of suVering from delayed- onset trauma. 167\u0001is is important because this type of trauma has been suVered by victims of sexual abuse and political torture, which are crimes known to have been perpetrated by British Army personnel in both Northern Ireland and Iraq. 168 However, Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) stipulates that \u0091everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing\u0092. 169 Clari\u00aecatory documentation 163 ibid. 164 HC Deb 14 October 2019, vol 666. 165 Overseas Operations (Service Personnel and \u0003eterans) Act 2021 (n 93) pt 1, s 2. 166 ibid ss 1(3)\u0096(4). 167 US Department of Health and Human Services, Treatment Improvement Protocol: Trauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, US Department of Health and Human Services 2014) 57, 129. 168 Catherine O'Rourke and Aisling Swaine, \u0091Gender, \u0003iolence and Reparations in Northern Ireland: Told\u0092 (2017) 21(9) IJHR 1302, 1308\u0096 11; European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (n 4) 21. 169 European Convention on Human Rights, art 6(1). 71 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 further notes that this must take place \u0091within a reasonable time\u0092. 170 Whilst the ECHR endorses expiration dates for legal investigations, it can be argued that the blanket \u0091\u00aeve year\u0092 period in the Act does not appreciate the complex nature of allegations against the armed forces. As illustrated by the case of L/C F, a blanket expiration date on proceedings is not a reasonable component of legislation as it does not allow for cases to be assessed individually based on their circumstances and varying temporal requirements. 171 Whilst the legislation applies to the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, Mills claims that similar but separate legislation is being proposed for legacy issues in Northern Ireland. 172 If this is true, it will be founded on the claim that investigations into the actions of the armed forces in past con\u00aficts are \u0091disproportionately high\u0092 and \u0091unnecessary\u0092. 173\u0001is statement is contradicted by the \u00aegures published by \u0002e Guardian in 2019: of the 300,000 British Army personnel who served in Northern Ireland, the MoD informed the media outlet that approximately 150 to 200 of them currently face investigations. 174 If accurate, these \u00aegures suggest that future legislation will have been designed to protect less than 1 per cent of the personnel involved in Operation Banner. 175 \u0001e vigour of t he British government in protecting the British Army through legal instruments, despite acknowledging the abuses of civilians overseas, is reminiscent of MP Maudling's praise of 1 Para in his erroneous statements to the House in 1972. 176\u0001is attitude persis ts 170 European Convention on Human Rights, \u0091Guide on Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights \u0097 Right to a Fair Trial (Criminal Limb)\u0092 (2020), 59. 171 ibid 60. 172 Mills (n 125) 15. 173 HC Deb 20 May 2019, vol 660. 174 Ministry of Defence, \u0091Armed Forces Mark 50 Years since the Start of Operations in Northern Ireland\u0092 ( Gov.uk , 2019) <https://www.gov.uk/government/news/armed- Bowcott (n 4). 175 HC Deb 20 May 2019, vol 660. 176 HC Deb 31 Jan 1972, vol 830, col 32. 72 York Law Review in House of Commons debates, as Damien Moore MP stated in 2019 that the deaths attributed to the British forces in Northern Ireland were a \u0091result of entirely lawful\u0092 actions. 177\u0001is is a contravention of ministers' duties to honesty and integrity. 178 It directly contrasts with evidenced narratives of excessive force used by British soldiers in Northern Ireland, one example being documented in the Saville Report. 179 As made abundantly clear in the debates about the legacy of the Troubles cited throughout this paper, the victims of violence perpetrated by personnel of the British armed forces have not been consistently and collectively prioritised by British politicians. 180 However, there have been statements made to the House by MPs, such as Stephen Pound, who have advocated for the importance of mentioning victims in House of Commons debates. Whilst recognising that it is indeed \u0091unfortunate\u0092 that veterans are being investigated for historical allegations, Pound underscored the signi\u00aecance of victims of violence, concluding that, ultimately, \u0091we have to look into the eyes of those whose relatives were killed\u0092. 181 McEvoy echoes this sentiment, arguing that the most diYcult issue regarding the Northern Irish peace process is \u0091the impact upon those who have been victims\u0092. 182 In pushing through legislation that opposes historical investigation, the British government is prioritising the preservation of the reputation of British armed forces over justice for civilians unlawfully killed in con\u00afict. 177 HC Deb 20 May 2019, vol 660. 178\u0002e Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament (Houses of Parliament, 2018), 1. 179 Walsh, Bloody Sunday and the Rule of Law in Northern Ireland (n 11) 12. 180 HC Deb 20 May 2019, vol 660. 181 ibid. 182 Kieran McEvoy, \u0091Prisoners, the Agreement, and the Political Character of the Northern Ireland Con\u00afict\u0092 (1998) 22 Fordham Int'l \u0001is pa per has discussed the case of Bloody Sunday and the charges that have subsequently been brought against L/C F, a member of the 1st Battalion of the Parachute Regiment of the British Army. By chronologically analysing the events of 30 January 1972, the paper has sought to demonstrate the importance of government-facilitated historical investigations to secure justice for civilians unlawfully abused and killed by British Army personnel during con\u00afict. Discussions have determined that the British government in 1972 had an institutional responsibility to inquire into the events of Bloody Sunday and hold accountable those who caused the deaths of 13 boys and men and the injury of 15 more. Instead, the Widgery tribunal of inquiry and subsequent report was driven by political motivations to deal a \u0091blow\u0092 to the IRA's campaign by justifying the actions of 1 Para. 183 Had an impartial and thorough investigation into the evidence been taken in the immediate aftermaths of Bloody Sunday, there would not have been a need for historical investigation into the events. 184 However, owing to the \u00afawed nature of the Widgery Report, the second inquiry sat for ten years to consider the evidence to establish the truth of the events, which led to charges being brought against one member of 1 Para in 2019, L/C F. Any possible charges of murder or attempted murder against other members of the unit were unable to be carried forward by the PPS due to the inadmissibility of perjured statements made by 1 Para about their actions on Bloody Sunday. \u0001e charges brought against L/C F for murder and attempted murder are a positive step towards reconciliation and societal healing in Northern Ireland. 185 Despite this, there are sections of the general public, particularly British Army veterans, that do not accept the historic prosecution of soldiers. \u0001is is re\u00afected in the media, who 183 HC Deb 19 April 1972, vol 835, col 527. 184Crime, Truth and Justice (n 51) 65. 185 Brewer and Hayes (n 154) 513. 74 York Law Review perpetuate a narrative of a legal \u0091witch hunt\u0092 against Northern Ireland veterans. 186\u0001e Saville Report oVered the British government the opportunity to re\u00afect on the way in which allegations against the armed forces are addressed and the mechanisms in place to seek justice for unlawfully killed civilians. However, the unwillingness to investigate such allegations appears largely unchanged since 1972 ; thus, known abuses of civilians in Iraq by British forces have been ignored, and justice for unlawfully killed and abused civilians obstructed. Such obstruction to the investigation of historical allegations has been formalised by the Overseas Operations Act. As a statute of limitations on allegations made against British soldiers during operations, the Act does not appreciate the complex nature of trauma associated with soldier misconduct in con\u00afict, as demonstrated by the case of Bloody Sunday. Instead, known allegations of abuse against Iraqi civilians by British Army personnel have failed to be investigated, and further historic allegations will be opposed in statute by the \u0091presumption against prosecution\u0092 of British soldiers enshrined in the Act. 187 186 HC Deb 11 March 2020, vol 673. 187 Overseas Operations (Service Personnel and \u0002eterans) Act 2021 (n 93) pt 1, s 2. Legitimising Biopiracy? Fairness and EYcacy of the Nagoya Protocol Dominic Quer\u00e9e Hodnett Abstract When utilised in new and innovative ways, traditional knowledge associated with vascular plants and other organisms is rendered patentable, which allows for its corporate exploitation in pharmaceutical and agricultural applications . \u0001 is article explores the Nagoya Protocol, a voluntary, international agreement that purportedly promotes bene\u00aet-sharing arising from the commercialisation of traditional knowledge. First, this paper establishes the role of stakeholders in the bioprospecting \u00aeeld, analysing how the Nagoya Protocol unfairly and inequitably promotes corporate interests to the detriment of state and indigenous interests in the global south. Second, it addresses how the Nagoya Protocol perpetuates unfairness between regions, largely due to varying state practices arising from diVering interpretations of the Nagoya Protocol's bene\u00aet-sharing doctrine. \u0001ird, it contends that such unfairness is a remnant of colonial attitudes and relies on reticence to promote global inequality, under the guise of global bene\u00aet, to the considerable harm of lesser-developed countries. Consequently, it is argued that lesser-developed countries should exploit the \u00afexibility embedded within the regime to tighten domestic law, allowing for a fairer distribution of bene\u00aets to indigenous stakeholders. Ultimately, this paper advances the debate on bioprospecting to consider whether the line drawn between corporate innovation and indigenous interests in the Nagoya Protocol is fair and equitable or whether it instead operates to advance western corporate interests. 76 York Law Review 1Bioprospecting and Bene\u00aet-Sharing: the Nagoya Protocol \u0001e Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Bene\u00aets Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity 2010 (\u0091Nagoya Protocol\u0092) supplements the earlier Convention on Biological Diversity 1992 (\u0091CBD\u0092). 1\u0001e CBD built momentum in promoting the conservation of biological diversity and re\u00afected a \u0091turning point\u0092 in the sustainable use of biological components. However, many believe that it inadequately addressed bene\u00aet-sharing to indigenous ethnic and national groups, whose traditional knowledge associated with vascular plants is actively patented by global corporations through bioprospecting activity, often without tangible bene\u00aet to these aforementioned ethnic and national groups. 2\u0001e Nagoya Protocol was developed to remedy such unfairness arising from bioprospecting (the search for plant and animal species from which medicinal drugs, biochemicals and other commercially valuable material can be obtained) by promoting the principle of bene\u00aet-sharing. 3 \u0001is article evaluates the extent to which the Nagoya Protocol has operated to remedy the issues arising from the exploitation and commercialisation of traditional knowledge and analyses its role in promoting principles of fairness and equity.

Contrastingly, plant knowledge and traditional uses are patentable, as the speci\u00aec employ of the living material re\u00afects scienti\u00aec or human progress \u0097 ie occurring by means of human intervention. 9 \u0001is article advances the ongoing dialogue surrounding the \u0091product of nature\u0092 doctrine by contending that bene\u00aet-sharing provisions per se should not legitimise biopiracy, which is viewed as inherently unfair and inequitable under normative principles established in international law. Biopiracy is understood here to be the \u0091unauthorised and uncompensated\u0092 taking of biological resources by parties who \u0091patent them for their own bene\u00aet\u0092, and is widely agreed to be an illegal form of bioprospecting. 10 Biopiracy is of speci\u00aec relevance to traditional knowledge relating to vascular plants that possess pharmaceutical and agricultural potential. Morgera contends that a regime consensually enforced by signatory states may not be truly consensual, and thus fair, for indigenous groups. 11\u0001is article expands this view and contends that the Nagoya Protocol legitimises biopiracy by virtue of its dependence on lesser-developed signatory states, illustrating unfairness both within domestic law (between state and indigenous peoples in the global south) and at the international level (between countries in the global north and global sou th). \u0001 e Nagoya Protocol promotes a 7 Emmanuel Salami, \u0091Patent Protection and Plant \u0002ariety Rights for Plant Related Inventions in the EU and Selected Jurisdictions\u0092 (2018) 40(10) EIPR 630. 8 Elizabeth Martin, Concise Medical Dictionary (9th edn, OUP 2015) 234. 9 Tim Roberts, \u0091Patenting Plants around the World\u0092 (1996) 18(10) EIPR 531. 10 Chris Park and Michael Allaby, A Dictionary of Environment and Conservation (3rd edn, OUP 2017) 234. 11 Elisa Morgera, \u0091 \u0001e Need for an International Legal Concept of Fair and Equitable Bene\u00aet Sharing\u0092 (2016) 27(2) EJIL 354. 79 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 globalised and arguably unsustainable provisioning of resources, dependent on a form of \u0091colonial pillaging\u0092 of traditional knowledge. 12 3Ownership and Innovation \u0002aried perspectives on \u0091ownership\u0092 kindle the biopiracy con\u00afict. 13 Whilst Rosenberg, a western philosopher, argues that IP ownership is a right, eVectively promoting restrictions and licensing in respect of traditional knowledge associated to vascular plants, others believe that this fosters an environment in which the \u0091tragedy of the commons\u0092 principle becomes enshrined, as individualistic, pro\u00aet-driven ideals accelerate the \u0091exploitation of Earth's resources\u0092. 14 Conversely, other theorists suggest that, if left unregulated without an eVective property system, the destruction of natural resources becomes inevitable through \u0091resource degradation and depletion\u0092. 15 In the bioprospecting \u00aeeld, IP ownership is deemed necessary to promote innovation and allow for economic growth and prosperity. 16 \u0001e establishment of property and monopoly rights conferred by IPRs allows for state regulation and the promulgation of bene\u00aet arising from commercialisation.

Whilst Salami contends that IPR restrictions on plant use, whether by means of patenting knowledge or scienti\u00aec processes, contravene principles of vitalism, others contend that humankind's endeavours in patenting plants are morally fair and justi\u00aeable by virtue of development pursuits. 21\u0001is view adopts a perspective that the patenting of life forms \u0091is justi\u00aeable in science\u0092, as re\u00afected in the US ruling of Diamond v Chakrabarty , which established the doctrine that the novel creation of life, or employment of it, maintains innovation, and thus ought to be patentable to maintain ordinary pursuits in IP law. 22 17 Robert Benko, Protecting Intellectual Property Rights: Issues and Controversies (American Enterprise Institute 1987) 17. 18 Paul Torremans, Holyoak and Torremans Intellectual Property Law (9th edn, OUP 2019) 15. 19 ibid. 20 ibid. 21Salami (n 7); Diamond v Chakrabarty 22 ibid. 81 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 Whilst some argue that the very commercialisation of vascular plants represents innovation in the bioprospecting \u00aeeld, others contend that the \u0091discovery\u0092 of traditional knowledge associated with vascular plant properties does not satisfy the product of nature doctrine, delegitimising any claim over the corporate discovery of traditional knowledge in this respect. 23 Arguably, the pre-existence of traditional knowledge in bioprospecting ful\u00aels the doctrine of innovation, as the traditional knowledge itself is tangibly diVerent to the vascular plant to which the traditional knowledge applies. 3.2 Priority \u0001e right of priority dictates that the \u00aerst to \u00aele an application for a patent or right over property establishes a right in title. 24 Formally, the Nagoya Protocol allows for corporations to ful\u00ael the right of priority, despite the pre-existence of traditional knowledge, provided that the patent conveying appropriate knowledge is innovative by virtue of being newly registered within a domestic regime. 25\u0001is position promotes innovation by allowing for commercialisation, whilst eVectively relegating original indigenous users to stakeholders \u0097 ie failing to recognise the historical role of indigenous people in innovating traditional knowledge. 26 \u0001e doctr ine of innovation promotes the concept of materialism in the bioprospecting \u00aeeld, by establishing that IPRs are necessary to safeguard and promote innovations in the use of genetic material. 27 \u0001eoretically, such a view conforms to the Aquinian perspective that innovators naturally deserve recognition for their output, while at the 23 Benko (n 17) 17. 24 Joseph Straus, \u0091 \u0001e Right to Priority in Article 4A (1) of the Paris Convention and Article 87(1) of the European Patent Convention\u0092 (2019) 14(9) JIPLP 687, 687. 25 Nagoya Protocol (n 1) arts 15\u009618. 26 Crane and Matten (n 4) 51. To clarify, Crane and Matten observe that those who \u0091are aVected by\u0092 an organisation's objectives are stakeholders. 27 Benko (n 17) 17. 82 York Law Review same time Bentham's \u0091greatest happiness\u0092 principle is satis\u00aeed \u0097 as IPRs promote innovation that bene\u00aets mankind, satisfying both consumer and producer interests. 28 Currently the Nagoya Protocol presents a purportedly satisfactory playing \u00aeeld for bioprospecting corporations, which prosper from innovations arising from genetic material. However, the Protocol fails to account for unfairness in respect of other stakeholders or pre-existing users who fall outside the corporate\u0096consumer nexus \u0097 arguably breaching normative interpretations of the doctrine of innovation. \u0001e Nagoya Protocol arguably contravenes the doctrine of innovation by failing to necessarily account for the innovation of indigenous groups, whilst allowing for the corporate patenting of traditional knowledge by a party that has not necessarily partaken in innovation, per se. In other terms, whilst innovation in respect of genetic material is bene\u00aecial from a corporate interest perspective, bene\u00aet-sharing provisions in the Nagoya Protocol fail to adequately re\u00afect the contribution of traditional knowledge, which arguably constitutes the major innovation. \u0001e Lockean view, expressed by authors such as Morris, holds that \u0091every man has a property right in his own person\u0092 \u0097 ergo, intellectual creativity leads to the property right over that intellectual creativity. 29 As such, the existence of traditional knowledge within indigenous communities arguably establishes a property right, supporting the view that indigenous people inform the innovation undertaken in a bioprospecting regime, thereby arguably securing their right to the patent under the doctrine of innovation. \u0001e employment of the right of priority principle within current interpretation of the Nagoya Protocol defeats the purpose of the doctrine of innovation by circumventing a requirement for innovation, allowing for corporate pro\u00aeteering to the detriment of indigenous communities. 28\u0001omas Aquinas in Raymond Wacks, Understanding Jurisprudence: An Introduction to \u0002eory (5th edn, O UP 2017) 18; Lucia Zedner, Criminal Justice (Clarendon Law Series, OUP 2004) 91. 29 Sean Morris, \u0091 \u0001e Contemporary Ideological Legitimacy of Global Intellectual Property Rights\u0092 [2020] IPQ 44, 45; Walton H bioprospecting \u00aeeld, indigenous interests are diYcult to quantify. Whilst the Nagoya Protocol promotes objective ideals of bene\u00aet- sharing, in accordance with western ideals that monetary and non- monetary bene\u00aets re\u00afect adequate compensation for loss, Macfarlane and others present the notion that indigenous interests may vary from western cultural norms. 30 Consequently, bene\u00aet-sharing provisions may re\u00afect an unsatisfactory outcome for certain indigenous groups. Whilst Article 6(2) of the Nagoya Protocol re\u00afects the necessity of signatory states consulting indigenous groups, the role of the state in safeguarding these stakeholders is relatively limited. 31 Similarly, placed on \u0091sustainable development\u0092 in Article 1 of the Nagoya Protocol, such a principle arguably remains unsubstantiated in later provisions, and amounts to little more than a high-level aspiration. 32 Consequently, a lack of protection arises regarding indigenous stakeholder interests as adherence and enforcement remain in the hands of the state, which, as established later, may be under coercive \u00aenancial pressure stemming from a desire for economic development. \u0001is stance is echoed by Morgera, who argues that the Nagoya IPR manifests as a positive legal development, whilst stripping the dignity away from indigenous populations without adequately establishing a mutual promissory agreement comprising what they may desire. 33 Instead, the onus rests on the state \u0097 whose economic interests may con\u00afict with 30 Ben McFarlane, Nicholas Hopkins, and Sarah Neild, Land Law: Text, Cases and Materials (4th edn , OUP 2018) 359; Ngang and Ageh (n 6) 426. 31 Nagoya Protocol (n 1) art 6. Article 6(2) states that signatories shall \u0091take measures, as appropriate, with the aim of ensuring that the prior informed consent or approval and involvement of indigenous and local communities is obtained for access to genetic resources where they have the established right to grant access to such resources.\u0092 32 Nagoya Protocol (n 1) art 1. 33 Morgera (n 11) 354. 84 York Law Review those of indigenous groups \u0097 to determine outcomes, usually re\u00afecting an unfair and overly formalist interpretation of the right of priority. 34 Cadavid contends that a lack of consultation with indigenous communities renders IPRs invalid. 35 Without adequate consultation, he argues that signatories impose legislative provisions on groups whose stakeholder interests remain unidenti\u00aeed, whose lobbying power and resources are generally limited, and whose interests are most likely to be overlooked on a diplomatic level. 36 Cadavid's analysis focusses on the use of power by public authorities, which, by virtue of international agreements, allows the state to establish unjust and disproportionate expectations on indigenous people, resulting in provisions that, though seemingly legitimate (supporting the pacta sunt servanda principle), fail to respect ordinary public law duties in jurisdictions across the global south. 37\u0001is perspective re\u00afects earlier criticisms of the International Union for the Protection of New \u0002arieties of Plants 1961 (\u0091UPO\u0002\u0092) and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights 1995 (TRIPS), both IPRs that sought to address bioprospecting issues on an international scale, whilst arguably failing to promote proportionality on a domestic basis. 38 Whilst such criticisms are valid, diYculty arises in addressing varied interests among ethnic groups globally to consolidate in an international agreement. Should a new IPR be too comprehensive, it risks dissuading signatories as a result of potential transposition issues into domestic law. As such it is necessary for consultation clauses to re\u00afect the 34 Straus (n 24) 687. 35 Jhonny Anonio Pabon Cadavid, \u0091Indigenous and Traditional Communities Must Be Consulted before Approval of Intellectual Property Treaties\u0092 (2015) 10(1) JIPL 11. 36 International Convention for the Protection of New \u0002arieties of Plants 1991. 37 Cadavid (n 35 ); \u0091Pacta Sunt Servanda\u0092 (1959) 53(4) AJIL 775. 38International the Protection of New \u0002arieties of Plants 1961; Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Pro perty Rights 1995; Piers Bierne and Nigel South, Issues in edn Knowledge\u0092 TLR 134. 85 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 doctrine of proportionality; any developments in an IPR must promote consultation on basis of domestic interpretation \u0097 allowing for proportionate domestic responses to varied interests among indigenous groups. 39 \u0001e con\u00afict between corporate interests, state interests, and indigenous interests re\u00afects a global IP environment wherein inequality is propagated by virtue of the discrepancy between northern capitalism and southern cultural identity. 40 States, in promoting economic development, arguably veer in support of corporate interests as a result of the perceived economic advantage this provides to the \u0091greater good\u0092 of its people. 41 Arguably, temporal innovation undertaken by indigenous people is ignored, resulting in unfair and inequitable bene\u00aet- sharing provisions that undermine the legitimacy of the IPRs themselves \u0097 whether by failing to satisfy the right of priority in IP law or by failing to earnestly recognise the role of indigenous communities as stakeholders in bioprospecting activity. 42 5Corporate Social Responsibility CSR is now a widely accepted part of corporate governance and encourages the involvement of business in promoting contribution to \u0091social, economic and environmental development\u0092. 43 Essentially, CSR promotes sustainable business practices, based on an understanding that stakeholders in corporate activity lie beyond those with \u00aenancial 39 Lisa Webley and Harriet Samuels, Complete Public Law: Text, Cases and Materials (4th edn, OUP 2018) 538. of Green Criminology\u0092 in Piers Beirne and Nigel South (eds), Issues in Green Criminology (1st edn, Willan 2007). 41 Nick Marshall, \u0091Whither Intellectual Property Law in Jersey\u0092 (2018) JGLR 4, 4. 42 Straus (n 24) 687. 43Crane and Matten (n 4) 51; Department of Trade and Industry, \u0091Press Release: Corporate Social Responsibility \u0097 A Draft International Strategic Framework\u0092 (DfT, 22 March 2004) <https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20060216070732/http://www.dti.gov.uk/ sustainability/weee/corp_soc_resp.pdf> accessed 10 March 2020. 86 York Law Review interests, and are also within the communities where corporate activity occurs. Although not a legal principle, the concept of CSR informs corporate ethics and company law and is therefore of interest to organisations involved in bioprospecting. \u0001e Nagoya Protocol encapsulates notions of CSR by allowing for the imposition of community-focussed obligations on corporate stakeholders within domestic regimes. Provisions include requiring states to provide a \u0091help desk\u0092 for indigenous and local communities; promoting educational collaboration and training; and encouragin g corporations to recognise indigenous and local communities as stakeholders in their activity through \u0091social recognition\u0092. 44 Although these bene\u00aet-sharing provisions provide positive recognition in respect of indigenous groups, these measures do little to enforce a fair and equitable delineation of ownership between corporate and indigenous entities. Arguably, this re\u00afects the notion that the Nagoya Protocol equates to little more than corporate CSR measures, with the sole diVerence being that compliance is regulated by the respective signatory state, as opposed to being a voluntary corporate operation. 45 Moreover, such action diminishes the cultural innovation of indigenous and ethnic communities \u0097 framing them as stakeholders rather than creators. \u0001e Nagoya Protocol thereby re\u00afects a westernised perspective on IPRs the bioprospecting arguably prioritises the \u0091exchange, pro\u00aet and capital accumulation\u0092 endemic within capitalism over the interests of stakeholders without substantial \u00aenancial interest. 46 Such central concerns have diminished the role of innovation by virtue of the overtly formalist interpretation this establishes on the right of priority, which, although intending to promote fairness in IPRs, has been circumvented to prioritise corporate innovation. 47 44 Nagoya Protocol (n 1) art 21(c), annexes 2(d), (p). 45 Nagoya Protocol (n 1) art 16. 46 Cato (n 6) 61. 47 Straus (n 24) 687. 87 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 In essence, the Nagoya Protocol re\u00afects an IPR wherein corporate interests, owing to their seemingly bene\u00aecial output, have been promoted without adequate consideration for the role of innovation under the right of priority, and by replacing equitable bene\u00aet with watered-down CSR provisions. Ultimately, this re\u00afects a lack of adherence to the core principles of the doctrine of innovation, arguably compromising the Nagoya Protocol's legitimacy as a fair and equitable IPR. 6Rule of Law Considerations In accordance with the rule of law, states have a duty to respect obligations in international law, as conceptualised by Bingham and the Venice Commission. 48 Such alignment is propagated by the pacta sunt servanda (\u0091agreements must be kept\u0092) principle. 49 Whilst compliance with the Nagoya Protocol is addressed by Article 18, which ensures that signatories comply and cooperate in their adoption of provisions into domestic law, the Nagoya Protocol itself is inherently \u00afawed in contending with di\u0001ering legal regimes internationally, owing to the onus of interpretation this places on states with varying normative values. 50 \u0002e rule of law is a universal concept \u0097 extending beyond the parameters of western or eastern jurisprudence. 51 States must comply with it to prevent tyranny and anarchy resulting from the arbitrary exercise of public power. 52\u0002e concept that a world deprived of the rule of law, where law becomes licence, is mimetic of the tragedy of the 48 Bingham (n 4 ); Preamble, \u0091European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission), Rule of Law Checklist\u0092 (European Commission for Democracy through Law 2016). 49 Wehberg (n 37). 50 Nagoya Protocol (n 1) art 18. 51 Soli Sorabjee, \u0091 \u0002e Rule of Law: A Moral Imperative for South Asia and the World \u0092 (Soli Sorabjee Lecture, Brandeis University, 2010) 2. 52 Anne Dennett, Public Law Directions (OUP 2019) 147. 88 York Law Review commons theory. 53 Compliance relies on the moral integrity of the state itself, further emphasising the importance of the pacta sunt servanda principle. 54 Bingham lists eight key ingredients in the rule of law, observing that a failure to comply with any results in a breach. 55 Ingredients of importance to state interests in the Nagoya Protocol include 1) equality, 2) certainty and \u0091substantive fairness\u0092, and 3) legality. 56\u0002e Nagoya Protocol arguably contravenes these ingredients and, in doing so, undermines its legitimacy as a source of international law in signatory jurisdictions. 57 6.1 Equality Equality is a key component of the rule of law. Bingham contended that \u0091laws of the land should apply equally to all, save to the extent that objective di\u0001erences justify di\u0001erentiation\u0092. 58 Likewise, the Venice Commission made clear the necessity of \u0091equality before the law and non-discrimination\u0092. 59\u0002e Nagoya Protocol contravenes the principle of equality by promoting supposedly equitable bene\u00aet-sharing over true equitable interests \u0097 as re\u00afected in Article 1 of the Nagoya Protocol, which centres the objective of the Nagoya Protocol on bene\u00aet-sharing. 60 \u0002is is intrinsically inequitable owing to the lack of involvement and consultation it a\u0001ords to indigenous people, whilst their innovation is utilised commercially regardless of any extra-patrimonial right 53 Hardin (n 14). 54 Wehberg (n 37). 55 Bingham (n 4). 56 Je\u0001rey Jowell, Dawn Oliver, and Colm O'Cinneide, \u0002e Changing Constitution (8th edn, OUP 2015) 3; Neil Parpworth, Constitutional and Administrative Law (10th edn, OUP 2018) 38. 57 Bingham (n 4). 58 Scott Slorach and others, Legal Systems & Skills (3rd edn, OUP 2017) 25. 59 European Commission (n 48). 60 Nagoya Protocol (n 1) art 1. 89 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 assertion of a doctrine of innovation claim. 61 Conversely, it may be argued that \u0091objective di\u0001erences\u0092 (as de\u00aened by Bingham) should allow for a form of \u0091ancestral patenting\u0092 whereby the requirement for innovation is set aside in favour of recognising the extra-patrimonial rights of indigenous communities. 62 Such a view re\u00afects the perilous discrepancy emerging in state interpretation and practice \u0097 whilst formalism and monism promote an unadulterated title, with ancillary bene\u00aet-sharing provisions, whilst natural law and dualism arguably extend the concept of extra-patrimonial rights. Overall, this re\u00afects an IPR that fails to satisfy the rule of law by virtue of the inequality it creates in respect of the right of priority . \u0002is is due to the preference that the IPR currently shows towards corporate interests and the divergent interpretations by states, as outlined later on. 63 6.2 Certainty Certainty is another ingredient of the rule of law. 64 From a positivist perspective, legal certainty propagates the idea that any regime is fair, provided that the system conforms \u0091to its own clear rules\u0092. 65\u0002is is embodied in the Nagoya Protocol regime, which, by promoting bene\u00aet- sharing, establishes a rule that enables parties to \u0091foresee with fair 61 Extra-patrimonial rights extend beyond patrimony (i.e. the property that makes up one\u0092s estate). In certain jurisdictions, extra-patrimonial rights essentially enable a party to be granted a right in another\u0092s property that is then binding upon subsequent transfer of that property. Extra-patrimonial rights do not alter the ownership of the property, but simply afford rights to others without patrimony. 62 Bingham (n 4 ); Elizabeth Pain, \u0091French Institute Agrees to Share Patent Bene\u00aets after Biopiracy Accusations\u0092 ( Science , 2016) <https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/02/french-institute-agrees-share-patent- bene\u00aets-after-biopiracy-accusations#> accessed 10 March 2020. 63 Straus (n 24) 687. 64 Parpworth (n 56) 38. 65 Leslie Green and \u0002omas Adams, \u0091Legal Positivism\u0092 \u0002e Stanford Encyclopae dia of Philosophy edn, 2019) <https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-positivism/> accessed 1 May 2020; Scott Slorach and others (n 58) 25. 90 York Law Review certainty how the authorities will use its coercive powers\u0092. 66 However, legal certainty is not provided in the Nagoya Protocol for indigenous groups, where rules surrounding the patenting of traditional knowledge undermine ideas of natural justice, and thus certainty. \u0002is broader understanding of the rule of law is side-lined within the Nagoya Protocol's, as its current positivist approach does not ensure that legal progress moves in tandem with societal development. \u0002is arguably results in the arbitrary exercise of public power as there is a discrepancy between the legitimate expectations of justice, owed to indigenous communities, and the de facto implementation of the Protocol. As such, a positivist interpretation results in \u0091window dressing\u0092 \u0097 a means by which authorities seem virtuous without being virtuous \u0097 replacing \u0091legitimacy\u0092 with \u0091coercion\u0092. 67 \u0002e Nagoya Protocol creates a situation where economic incentives ride roughshod over the natural perspectives of justice. 68 IPRs provide great economic stimulus within a state, which arguably manifests as a coercive reason for a state to become signatory. 69 Despite the \u0091greater good\u0092 that economic growth encourages, the in\u00afuence that \u00aenancial accumulation exerts over expectations of justice results in greater cultural and social loss, as multinational corporations direct \u00aenancial proceeds elsewhere. 70 Such practice within the IP forum is exhibited in the Intellectual Property (Plant Varieties) (Jersey) Law 2016, 71 which seeks to \u0091encourage business to locate and invest\u0092, grounded on the basis that business arising from \u0091adherence to international treaties\u0092 is of greater advantage to jurisdictions over potential economic and cultural losses elsewhere. 72 66 Scott Slorach and others (n 58) 25. 67 Scott Slorach and others (n 58) 25\u009626. 68 Scott Slorach and others (n 58) 26. 69 Marshall (n 41) 10. 70 Jeremy Bentham in Zedner (n 28 ); Marshall (n 41) 10. 71 Intellectual Property (Plant Varieties) (Jersey) Law 2016. 72 Marshall (n 41) 10. 91 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 As such, the Nagoya Protocol re\u00afects capitalist doctrine, superseding legitimate expectations of law and natural justice. Whilst state interests are con\u00aficted depending on normative outlooks (ie priorities of justice or business) under legal positivism, the very purpose of law is to conform to social expectations and norms, in order to remain legitimate. 73 If not, rogue and \u0091brutish\u0092 justice will override \u0091civilised\u0092 jurisdictions \u0097 uprooting overarching concepts of fairness, justice, and equity. 74 Arguably, the discrepancy between legitimate expectations of bene\u00aet-sharing within the Nagoya Protocol and state practice arising from interpretation re\u00afects a lack of substantive fairness, impacting the legal certainty it provides to indigenous traditional knowledge users. 6.3 Legality Likewise, legality is an integral ingredient in the rule of law. 75\u0002is ingredient extends beyond adherence to international law, another necessity for the rule of law, and re\u00afects the need for law to respect constitutional values of a jurisdiction. Articles 15 to 18 of the Nagoya Protocol promote transposition into domestic law regimes, thus galvanising compliance on a domestic basis. 76\u0002e Venice Commission emphasises the importance of compliance in respect of legislative regimes, observing that public authorities must \u0091act within the limits of the powers that have been conferred on them\u0092 and that \u0091public authorities must actively safeguard the fundamental rights of individuals vis-\u00e0-vis other private actors\u0092. As such, acting within the powers conferred on a state by the Nagoya Protocol still arguably relies on the safeguarding the fundamental rights of indigenous groups. Depending on perception, the Nagoya Protocol breaches the spirit of the doctrine of innovation, instead promoting corporate interests . \u0002is arguably compromises its legality owing to the misapprehension of ownership rights by corporate bodies and the misguided conferring of 73 Patrick Selim Attiyah, Law and Modern Society (2nd edn, OUP 1995). 74\u0002omas Hobbes in Wacks (n 28) 25. 75 Bingham (n 4). 76 Nagoya Protocol (n 1) arts 15, 16, 17, 18. 92 York Law Review such rights by signatory states, undermining legitimacy. \u0002erefore, the Nagoya Protocol arguably does not conform to these particular rule of law concepts. \u0002e power it confers on states to distribute ownership rights and the scope for a lack of consultation with stakeholders therefore compromises: normative ideals of equality; any certainty it a\u0001ords to indigenous groups; and the legality of its terms. \u0002is is, of course, dependent on transposition into domestic law failing to remedy such shortcomings. It is necessary to consider whether it is in a state's interest to remedy such substantive issues. 7Colonial Legacy Linarelli observes that international law originated out of the \u0091use of force in support of European commercial interests to compel non- European peoples to trade in the conquests of the land, and resources of non-European peoples\u0092. 77 Such sentiment is echoed by Fassbender and Peters, who contend that international law re\u00afects \u0091Eurocentric values\u0092 of \u0091colonial origins\u0092 imposed on other regions and countries, despite reassurances that this imposition is a consensual interaction. 78 Conversely, Beinart and Middleton contend that transfers relating to plants and traditional knowledge under imperial and post-imperial regimes were not wholly consensual but instead depended on \u0091asymmetrical patterns\u0092 of trade and exchange, re\u00afecting the domination of western powers over indigenous communities. 79\u0002ese theories illustrate that international law is grounded in ideas of colonialism, the annexing of resources prevalent in lesser-developed 77 John Linarelli, Margot Salomon, and Muthucumaraswarmy Sornarajah, \u0002e Misery of International Law: Confrontations with Injustice in the Global Economy (OUP 2018) 25. 78 Bardo Fassbender and Anne Peters, \u0002e Oxford Handbook of the History of International Law (OUP 2012) 82. 79 William Beinart and Karen Middleton, \u0091Plant Transfers in Historical Perspective: A Review Article\u0092 (2004) 10(1) Env & History 3. 93 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 countries, and a western capitalisation of resources endemic to these regions. \u0002is theory extends to the \u00aeeld of bioprospecting. Former regimes, such as the UPOV and TRIPS agreements, received heightened criticism surrounding their provisions, which commentators respectively argued failed to account for indigenous stakeholder interests, and enabled the colonial exploitation of traditional knowledge. 80 Ultimately, the Nagoya Protocol similarly establishes a domination of the \u0091global north\u0092 over regions of the \u0091global south\u0092 in a corporate\u0096colonial conquest. 81 In her seminal work Plants and Empire , Schieberger draws parallels between modern bioprospecting and historical colonial pursuits. Portraying western \u0091ignorance\u0092 as a \u0091choice\u0092 rather than an incidental development of cultural internationalism, she conceives of the \u0091many forms of ignorance\u0092 as something ignorantly promoted by western powers and individuals \u0097 later codi\u00aeed by virtue of \u0091funding priorities, global strategies, national policies, the structures of scienti\u00aec institutions, trade patterns, and gender politics\u0092. Further, she observes how scienti\u00aec advancement historically led to the \u0091vili\u00aecation\u0092 of indigenous peoples, whose remedies, including plant knowledge associated with \u0091abortifacients\u0092, promoted the institutionalised view that non-European ethnic groups were immoral, belittling their customs whilst allowing for the hypocritical commercialisation of them. 82\u0002ese undertones, it is argued, continue to in\u00afuence the Nagoya Protocol, where ethnobotany has been subsumed by corporate interests as a result of institutionalised bias. 80 International Union for the Protection of New Varietie s of Plants 1961 (n 38); Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights 1995 (n 38); Charles Kamau Maina, \u0091Power Relations in the Traditional Knowledge Debate: A Critical Analysis of Forums\u0092 (2011) 18(2) Int J Cult Prop 144. 81 South (n 40) 239. 82 Abortifacients are substances capable, or believed to be capable, of inducing an abortion.

Firstly, evaluating how state practice allows for varied interpretation of provisions permits a broader consideration of whether the agreement strikes a just and fair balance between interests. Secondly, by analysing the outcome versus the intention of the agreement, it is possible to consider its legitimacy and e\u0001ectiveness as a source of international law seeking to promote \u0091equitable\u0092 and \u0091fair\u0092 bene\u00aet-sharing provisions. 85 A doctrine established in the Nagoya Protocol is that of \u0091fair and equitable\u0092 bene\u00aet-sharing arising from the use of genetic resources. 86 From a positivist perspective, rulings arising from disputes between parties with reference to the Nagoya Protocol ought to stick to this key objective owing to the existence of such a provision, regardless of merit or detriment. 87 \u0091Fair\u0092 and \u0091equitable\u0092 bene\u00aet-sharing is similarly paradigmatic of natural law and corresponds to the Aquinian view that sharing per se re\u00afects a natural inclination of wider love and grace that \u0091elevates the natural abilities of humans\u0092. 88 By contrast, it would be remiss not to address the fact that corporations themselves lack human personality, despite being legal persons, and that states themselves re\u00afect \u0091inaccessible character\u0092 due to the breadth of their representation 83 Fassbender and Peters (n 78) 82. 84 ibid. 85 Nagoya Protocol (n 1) art 1. 86 Nagoya Protocol (n 1) art 1. 87Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (n 55) 88Nagoya Protocol (n 1) art 1; Wacks (n 28) 18. 95 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 and division of powers. 89 It is therefore necessary to explore the role of adjudication in civil and common law regimes to appreciate whether the doctrine of bene\u00aet-sharing transcends into domestic regimes in a fair and equitable way, as per an Aquinian interpretation, or whether interpretation gives rise to an unfair discrepancy and sustains the \u0091misery of international law\u0092. 90 8.1 Quas sia amara \u0002e Nagoya Protocol thus establishes an IPR regime that is stacked in favour of corporate interests, despite compelling CSR activity. 91\u0002is is re\u00afected in the Quassia incident (\u0091Le cas de biopiraterie du Couachi\u0092) arising in French Guiana. 92 Here, the French Institute for Development Research (IRD) consulted the Kali'na, Palikur and Creole indigenous groups, inter alia, on traditional remedies for treating malaria. 93\u0002e IRD subsequently patented compounds extracted from the Quassia amara plant, endemic to South America, which expressed bene\u00aecial properties for malaria treatment. 94\u0002e Fondat ion Danielle Mitterrand (FDM) contested the patent's legitimacy, which failed to acknowledge the Guianese communities who contributed traditional knowledge to the IRD. 95\u0002e FDM argued that the traditional knowledge was \u0091crucial 89 David Sugarman, \u0091Reconceptualising Company Law: Re\u00afections on the Law Commission's Consultation Paper on Shareholder Remedies: Part 1\u0092 (1997) 18(8) Company Lawyer 227. 90Wacks (n 28) 18; Linarelli , Salomon, and Sornarajah (n 77) 25. 91 687. 92 Danielle Miterrand France Libertes, 93 Bourdy (n 5) 290. 94 World Weekly, \u0091Biopiracy: When Corporations Steal Indigenous Practices and Patent \u0002em for Pro\u00aet \u0092 (\u0002 e World, 2016 ) <https://www.theworldweekly.com/reader/view/2464/biopiracy-when-corporations- steal-indigenous-practices-and-patent-them-for-pro\u00aet> accessed 15 May 2020. 95 Bourdy (n 5) 290. 96 York Law Review for the developmental innovation\u0092, calling for the \u0091just and equitable sharing of the patent's bene\u00aets resulting from exploitation\u0092 between the IRD and indigenous groups. 96 A hearing held at the European Patent OYce in Munich acknowledged that bene\u00aet-sharing was necessary in accor dance with the Nagoya Protocol; although the IRD was under no obligation to share equity with indigenous groups, it ought to establish a unilateral bene\u00aet-sharing agreement. 97 Subsequently the parties reached a multilateral agreement wherein monetary bene\u00aet-sharing provisions were established to cover income arising from any commercialisation of the traditional knowledge. 98 \u0002e Quassia case is informative, as it \u00aerst con\u00aerms that the Nagoya Protocol has statutory bearing on entities wishing to exploit traditional knowledge, second as it re\u00afects corporate reticence to establish bene\u00aet- sharing provisions, and third as it re\u00afects an unfair power imbalance between corporate entities and indigenous groups. Such power asymmetries are re\u00afected in the intervention of the FDM, which both raised awareness of the case in support of indigenous groups and contested the legitimacy of the patent. Without charitable support, it is apparent that corporate interests would have overruled the interests of indigenous people . \u0002is arguably re\u00afects inadequacies in the Nagoya Protocol in ensuring that indigenous groups receive adequate consultation on corporate activity based of their own input \u0097 illustrating (1) a stark and unresolved con\u00afict between western corporate interests and indigenous interests in the bioprospecting \u00aeeld and (2) inadequate consultation naturally prevalent in state interpretation of the Nagoya Protocol. 8.2 Civil Law Perspective As a French case, the Quassia incident illustrates a civil law interpretation of Nagoya Protocol provisions, and arguably hints at the 96\u0002e World (n 93). 97 ibid. 98 ibid. 97 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 contemplation of \u0091moral rights\u0092, which introduce greater consideration for the right of priority in civil law jurisdictions. 99 Described as \u0091directly opposed to the Anglo-Saxon copyright system\u0092, the in\u00afuence of moral rights transcends a limited copyright scope and in\u00afuences practice in French IP law, re\u00afecting greater emphasis on moral and extra-patrimonial stakeholder considerations. 100 \u0002e outcome of the Quassia hearing re\u00afects the in\u00afuence of both civil law and moral rights in a bioprospecting case. Whilst the hearing established that bene\u00aet-sharing provisions were integral provisions within the Nagoya Protocol, the ruling seems to point to an acknowledgement that the use of traditional knowledge by indigenous people re\u00afects their individualism. \u0002is recognition arguably illustrates the weighing of \u0091proprietary\u0092 ownership against the \u0091extra-proprietary rights\u0092 granted to indigenous groups as stakeholders. 101\u0002e di\u0001erentiation between the use of traditional knowledge and the legality of patenting traditional knowledge illustrates a philosophy whereby ownership, and restrictions placed thereupon, can be freely in\u00afuenced by stakeholders' interests. 102 Whilst under civil law it is entirely possible for corporations to patent traditional knowledge, the inalienable, extra-patrimonial rights of indigenous people cannot be discredited, and as such requires consideration within the fair and equitable \u0091use\u0092 of biological resources. 103\u0002is philosophy re\u00afec ts Morillot's theory on French civil practice, and Klostermann's theory on patrimonial rights, wherein it is contended that ownership is valid only in the recognition of the innovator. 104 Such a theory is supported by Ngang and Ageh, who contend that traditional knowledge can be viewed as a form of cultural expression, and as such should be 99Bretonniere and Defaux (n 5) 83; Straus (n 24) 687. 100 Bretonniere and Defaux (n 5) 83. 101Nagoya Protocol (n 1) art 1; B retonniere and Defaux (n 5) 83. 102\u0002omas and the Droit Moral\u0092 (1997) 76(1) NCL Rev 1, 1. 103 Nagoya Protocol (n 1) art 1. 104Andre Morillot in Bretonniere and Defaux Sundara Rajan (ed), Moral Rights: Principles, Practice and New Technology (OUP 2011) 75\u009676. 98 York Law Review accounted for on a human rights basis, as opposed to under IPRs. 105 Given the value of traditional knowledge in expressing cultural identity, Ngang and Ageh contend that western concepts surrounding intangible property are inadequate in scope, arguably re\u00afecting the potential for extra-patrimonial rights as a means of promoting concepts of equality and fairness. 106 Moreover, the backlash against corporate domination in the Quassia case is mimetic of attitudes to ownership in both French and other European IPRs. French IP regimes o\u0001er explicit protection of moral rights. \u0002is is best re\u00afected in the sanctity of \u0091droit de suite\u0092 principle, which is an extra-patrimonial right a\u0001orded to creators or their heirs to receive a fee for the resale of their creation, regardless of its ownership. It is evident that such intervention is grounded in the \u0091originality\u0092 of the traditional knowledge, and the \u0091special relationship\u0092 forged between indigenous people and vascular plants . \u0002is means that as stakeholders, \u0091any harm done\u0092 in the commercialisation of a plant will \u0091e\u0001ectively be in\u00aficted on the author\u0092 \u0097 that being the indigenous group. 107\u0002is view mirrors artistic views on ritual and performance and plays into romantic concepts of \u0091identity\u0092 as not solely scienti\u00aec, or genetic but a re\u00afection of the customs and experiences that inform individual and group congruence. 108 Ultimately, the Quassia a\u0001air illustrates the way in which the Nagoya Protocol can be interpreted dualistically as a cultural and social phenomenon under civil law, promoting stakeholder interests as an extra-patrimonial right to property interests, despite inadequacies in the regime as a whole. Arguably, the role of the FDM in contesting the patent similarly illustrates a more socialist approach to challenging power asymmetries, 105 Ngang and Ageh (n 6) 426. 106 Ngang and Ageh (n 6) Art\u0092 (2006) 3 IPQ 223; Bretonniere a nd Defaux (n 5) 83. 108 and Ageh (n 6) 426. 99 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 by raising of awareness and condemning the \u0091exchange, pro\u00aet and capital accumulation\u0092 of corporate bodies when such \u0091central concerns\u0092 harm others. 109 Balick and Cox, proponents of dualism as state practice, similarly convey that \u0091the very roots of human culture are deeply entwined with plants\u0092. 110\u0002ey posit that both international agreements and human attachment should be considered in bioprospecting arbitration, establishing that monist interpretations sever human attachment in place of corporate interests. 111 Such a belief establishes that monist state practice surrounding IPRs including the Nagoya Protocol are outdated, reiterating the requirement for reform or greater emphasis on non-economic considerations in its interpretation. 8.3 Common Law Perspective Whilst the Quassia case arguably re\u00afects the scope for extra- patrimonial rights to be encompassed within bene\u00aet-sharing provisions, such a view is contrasted in the monist view adopted in common law jurisdictions. Monism dominates IP philosophy in common law jurisdictions, as the concept of ownership overrules other stakeholder interests, under the belief that extra-patrimonial rights compromise legal title. 112 Essentially, this re\u00afects the fact that corporatism and individualism are dominant forces in common law states, resulting in two key phenomena \u0097 common law jurisdictions generally rule more favourably in the interest of corporations, and, consequently, bioprospecting corporations register businesses and patents in favourable common law jurisdictions to protect IP, essentially to avoid paying bene\u00aet-sharing contributions to indigenous communities around the world. 113 109 Cato (n 6) 61. 110 Michael Balick and Paul Alan Cox, Plants, People, and Culture: \u0002e Science of Ethnobotany (Scienti\u00aec American Library 1997) 100. 111 ibid. 112 Cotter (n 102) 1. 113 Maina (n 80 ) 144; Marshall (n 41) 4. 100 York Law Review \u0002e monist approach ende mic to common law jurisdictions re\u00afects the sanctity of property within the majority of Anglo-US, and Commonwealth, jurisdictions. 114 Described as a \u0091fundamental right\u0092, intellectual property is treated as an asset that like material property can be divided equitably or wholly \u0097 restrictions may exist in ownership, but the implications of inalienable moral rights exert too substantial a risk in sti\u00afing \u0091innovation and experimentation\u0092. 115 Put simply, bene\u00aet- sharing attempts to satisfy both civil and common law regimes by attempting to provide greater stakeholder protection, which is ultimately at odds with such ownership principles. \u0002e Nagoya Protocol arguably contrasts with other IPRs, such as the Paris Convention, which purportedly established \u0091harmonisation\u0092 measures in respect of variation between dualist and monist regimes. 116 Despite the Nagoya Protocol obliging states to cooperate in the resolution of disputes, the regime respects the autonomy of distinctive legal systems, thereby allowing for a divergence in outcome. Such softness re\u00afects unfairness in \u0091equality before the law\u0092 internationally. Under common law regimes, several remedies may be available to indigenous stakeholders under the Nagoya Protocol. IP is a form of intangible property. 117\u0002e doct rine of proprietary estoppel establishes that, in property law, a claim by party B can give rise to personal or property rights over the property of party A, provided that a number of grounds are met. 118 Such a principle can arguably be considered a 114 Bretonniere and Defaux (n 5) 83. 115 Tom Allen, \u0091Property as a Fundamental Right in India, Europe and South Africa\u0092 (2007) 15(2) APLR 193. 116 Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property 188 3; Poku Adusei, \u0091Regulatory Diversity as Key to the Myth of Drug Patenting in Sub-Saharan Africa\u0092 (2010) 54(1) J Afr Law 26. 117 M Clarke and others, Commercial Law: Text, Cases and Materials (5th edn, OUP 2017) 54\u009655. \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 common law remedy to contending with biopiracy claims, dependent on these points being satis\u00aeed. 119 Although the doctrine of proprietary estoppel typically deals in land, Attenborough contends that the principle could be re\u00aegured to deal with environmental interests \u0097 arguably, it could similarly be applied to claims surround the biopiracy of traditional knowledge. 120 Under this arrangement, an indigenous group could operate as the claimant. By establishing that they would have a realised or promised interest in the corporate activity, the indigenous party should be able to rely on a corporation's assurances and establish detriment. Proprietary estoppel results in reliance damages \u0097 that being the \u0091minimum to do justice\u0092 to the a\u0003icted claimant. 121 Whilst the application of proprietary estoppel may remedy a breach of agreement under the Nagoya Protocol, such a resolution does not remedy broader shortcomings in respect of the fairness and equity embedded within the regime as a whole. Estoppel primarily focusses on the pecuniary award of damages, which may not be of interest to indigenous groups, and requires resources not ordinarily available to indigenous peoples, such as legal knowledge and travel \u00afexibility. \u0002e resolution ordinarily requires the input of NGOs to remedy wrongs of tort on behalf of indigenous groups, mirroring the role of FDM in the Quassia case, owing to the onus it places on the claimant. Moreover, indigenous groups must be able to establish numerous elements of the proprietary estoppel test. Such a monist regime re\u00afects less \u00afexibility in the extra-patrimonialism exhibited under French and civil law IP regimes, despite similar issues surrounding access to justice. As such, proprietary estoppel appeals only in its breadth of application within the existing IPR, and similarly only re\u00afects a doctrine that may be applied in common law jurisdictions ; in doing so, it fails to account 119 Daniel Attenborough, \u0091An Estoppel-Based Approach to Enforcing Environmental Responsibilities\u0092 (2016) 28 J Env Law 275. 120 ibid. 121Crabb v Arun District Council [1976] Ch 179 (CA) 198 (Lord Denning MR). 102 York Law Review for jurisdictional variation globally. Moreover, proprietary estoppel is monist in its scope, as the establishment of personal or property rights per se does not deal with the collective interests of indigenous populations, save for the award of equity in a patent in a class action. \u0002is remedy is variable depending on state practice, and wholly unsatisfactory in redressing a lack of recognition for innovation among indigenous people, should a tangible relationship not exist between corporations and indigenous people. If knowledge is transposed to a western source, and then on to a corporate entity, this remedy a\u0001ords limited, if any, protection to indigenous groups. 122 9Reform \u0002e foregoing discussion has established that the Nagoya Protocol is unfair and inequitable as a result of: (1) the bene\u00aet-sharing arrangements it establishes ; (2) the favour it extends to corporate stakeholders ; and (3) interpretation issues in international law. Its bene\u00aet-sharing provisions fail to adequately and collectively reimburse indigenous people as innovators, whilst the regime results in states incidentally breaching the core rule of law doctrines of equality, certainty, and legality. Variation in state practice waters down the bene\u00aet-sharing provision that the Nagoya Protocol seeks to advance, which in itself allows for a derogation of equitable involvement in exchange for weak CSR-like provisions. Bene\u00aet-sharing is arguably the central objective of the Nagoya Protocol, allowing for the revenue generated by multinational corporations to \u0091trickle down\u0092 into the local cultures where bioprospecting operations take place. 123 Having scrutinised the role of corporations in the Nagoya Protocol regime, it is apparent that the balancing line between corporate and indigenous interests is poorly 122 Cato (n 6) 61. 123Nagoya Protocol (n 1) art 1; Verdiana Giannetti and Gaia Rubera, \u0091Innovation for and from Emerging Countries: a Closer Look at the Antecedents of Trickle-Down and Reverse Innovation\u0092 (2019) 1(1) J Acad Marketing Science 1. 103 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 drawn. In promoting bene\u00aet-sharing, the Nagoya Protocol has prioritised the involvement of corporations over that of indigenous groups, by failing to acknowledge indigenous peoples' original ownership of traditional knowledge. 124\u0002is contravenes a naturalist interpretation of the doctrine of innovation as corporations have complete control over the equitable title, and thus commercial output, associated with traditional knowledge, to the detriment of original users, whose communities have arguably undertaken the innovation \u0097 whether historically or otherwise. In essence, this illustrates corporations bene\u00aeting from title without having made a novel contribution by virtue of the Nagoya Protocol. \u0002is undermines the doctrine of innovation and diminishes the integrity of the IPR. \u0002e bene\u00aet -sharing provisions of the Nagoya Protocol thus re\u00afect a codi\u00aeed extension of CSR regimes, without providing adequate stakeholder involvement to indigenous peoples through an equitable share of corporate interest. Remedy for this arguably rests in the strengthening of domestic interpretation in the global south. Annex 1(j) of the Nagoya Protocol provides a means for indigenous peoples to receive equity in corporate bioprospecting ventures, which appears an overlooked solution. 125 Incorporating and enforcing statutory rights for indigenous stakeholders to share in the commercial outputs of bioprospecting, more speci\u00aecally those embodying traditional knowledge, will consolidate a corporation's ability to legitimately bene\u00aet from traditional knowledge. It will do so by \u00aerstly satisfying the right of priority, secondly by providing fair and equitable bene\u00aets to indigenous people, and thirdly by providing indigenous people with a say in the corporate activity arising from the use of traditional knowledge. 126 Such changes would bolster the legitimacy of the Nagoya Protocol by placing heightened emphasis on bene\u00aet-sharing, as addressed in Article 1. 124 Nagoya Protocol (n 1) art 1. 125 Nagoya Protocol (n 1) Annex 1(J). 126 Straus (n 24) 687. 104 York Law Review Such domestic reform is unlikely to occur owing to the prevalence of corporate lobbying and protectionism in many nations, but may arguably encourage greater economic development by providing legal certainty to all stakeholders and promoting a dynamic and more fair and equitable distribution of bene\u00aet. However, the inadequacies identi\u00aeed here within the Nagoya Protocol re\u00afect the need for greater adherence to key rule of law doctrines and the need for greater consideration of indigenous stakeholders beyond moderate bene\u00aet-sharing. State practice waters down the bene\u00aet- sharing provisions of the Protocol when transposed into domestic law, by virtue of discrepancies in legislative regimes. In order to recognise the cultural innovation of indigenous people and ful\u00ael promises of true fairness and equity, it is submitted that a \u00afexible international regime should remain, allowing for greater domestic \u00afexibility among signatories. \u0002is al igns with Cato's contention that economies need localising in order to accommodate sustainable development and to promote non-corporate interests in economies. 127 With regard to the global bioprospecting \u00aeeld, this necessitates domestic legal reform to regionalise corporate activity, allowing for greater state regulation and greater stakeholder involvement. Such a view is re\u00afected by Morris, who contends that \u0091the concept of international property rights is, in itself, problematic\u0092, owing to the very suggestion that \u0091certain property rights are transferable beyond the sovereign state\u0092. 128 Similarly, he argues that the view that IP constitutes property per se only muddies interpretation, resulting in a \u0091system of rights\u0092 that \u0091privatise[s] public international law\u0092. 129 An appropriate remedy for this is a radical domestic reinterpretation of the Nagoya Protocol in the global south. Whereas the existing regime legitimises biopiracy by stripping the property rights of indigenous groups and replacing their involvement with weak bene\u00aet-sharing provisions, measures must be taken to promote equity in patents among indigenous groups, or an ability to assert extra-patrimonial rights universally. 127 Cato (n 6) 61. 128 Morris (n 29) 45. 129 ibid. 105 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 Views on what constitutes property vary within the international community, as does the legitimacy of extra-patrimonial rights. Whilst some states convey that traditional remedies re\u00afect artistry, 130 and as such ought to be protected under safeguards for artistic expression, others contend that traditional knowledge merely conforms to ordinary property ownership. 131\u0002e only way in which these discrepancies can feasibly be addressed is for a signatory to de\u00aene what it considers traditional knowledge to be, and to ensure that this ownership or artistry is protected in accordance with stricter domestic legislation. Such a domestic overhaul will not only a\u0001ord greater fairness and equity in the bioprospecting regime but will also localise global corporate operations. \u0002e need for more localised and specialised regulatory knowledge could help force corporations into considering and involving indigenous interests. Ultimately, the breaking of the present \u0091colonialist\u0092 attitude to the patenting of traditional knowledge rests on the exercise of autonomy by countries in the global south. \u0002e gl obal north is unlikely to commit to reform that may hinder its prosperity. 132 As the \u00aeeld of ethnobotany develops and indigenous rights become increasingly recognised, it is essential that signatories address a lack of equity and fairness in the Nagoya Protocol by adopting more stringent domestic regimes. 133 Such regimes will encourage a divergence from western reticence to distributing pro\u00aet, historically arising from colonial practice and business interests. 134 Fair and due consideration of rights will satisfy the spirit of the Nagoya Protocol by allowing for both dualist and monist regimes, and thus both common law and civil law jurisdictions, to properly engage with indigenous interests on a 130 Adusei (n 116) 26. 131 Adusei (n 116) 26. 132 Fassbender and Peters (n 78) 82. 133 J Valles and T Garnatje, \u0091A Vindication of Ethnobotany\u0092 (Metode Universitat > accessed 10 November 2019; Cathal Doyle, \u0091Indigenous Peoples and the Millennium Development Goals \u0097 Sacri\u00aecial Lambs or Equal Bene\u00aeciaries\u0092 (2009) 13(1) IJHR 44, 44. 134 Fassbender and Peters (n 78 ) 82; Cato (n 6) 61. 106 York Law Review proportionate basis. \u0002e provision of equity to indigenous origina tors of traditional knowledge will similarly reduce discrepancies in philosophy surrounding traditional knowledge \u0097 whether considered strict IP, as per the Lockean view, or \u0091cultural property\u0092 depending on the normative values of the jurisdiction.

Under its provisions, race can mean colour, nationality, ethnic or national origins. Hair is not explicitly mentioned, creating a grey area within the law. \u0001is paper considers the prevalence of hair discrimination cases in the United Kingdom, where racialised hair discrimination can be perpetuated through policies in schools or workplaces. Recent media reports have illustrated that these policies, which aim to regulate \u0091professional\u0092 hairstyles, can have a disparate impact on those with Afro-textured hair. Mixed raced pupils have been excluded from schools, with their hair perceived as \u0091unprofessional\u0092 and \u0091inappropriate\u0092. \u0001e United States of America (USA) has taken steps to address these issues through the CROWN Act 2020, which prohibits racialised hair discrimination. \u0001is paper posits that our current legal understanding of race, as it exists in the Equality Act 2010, is inadequate to address racialised hair discrimination. It proposes that reforms similar to those contained in the USA CROWN Act 2020 could be enacted to better encapsulate a more holistic statutory understanding of race. 108 York Law Review 1Introduction In 2019, Ruby Williams, a mixed-race high school student from east London, was awarded monetary compensation in an out-of-court settlement after being repeatedly sent home from school due to her \u0091Afro style hair\u0092. 1 Williams was told that her hair breached the school's policy, which stated that \u0091Afro style hair must be of reasonable size and length\u0092. 2 Despite the prohibition of racial discrimination in the Equality Act 2010 (EQA) cases of hair discrimination (HD) remain prevalent. 3 Further clarity within both the law and society is required in order to acknowledge and address the socialised perceptions of Black hair. In education and corporate policies, Black hair is often negatively labelled as \u0091unprofessional\u0092 or \u0091inappropriate\u0092, re\u00afecting the treatment of Black people in professional environments. 4 As \u0091one of the primary signi\u00aeers of [B]lack heritage\u0092, hair requires legal recognition and protection within the EQA and by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC). 5\u0001is paper addresses the inadequacy of available law and guidance in the following ways: 1 Kameron Virk, \u0091Ruby Williams: No Child with Afro Hair Should Su\u0002er Like Me\u0092 BBC News (London, 10 February 2020) <https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat- 45521094> accessed 4 September 2020. 2 ibid. 3G v X : Challenging an Discriminatory Work Hairstyle Policy <https://legal.equalityhumanrights.com/en/case/challenging-discriminatory-work- hairstyle-policy> accessed 27 May 2021 4 Aftab Ali, Lara OdoYn \u0093Discriminated O\u0002er Because She 27 accessed 5 September 2020; Meah Johnson, \u0091I Am Not My Hair, Hair Discrimination in Corporate America\u0092 (2019\u009620) 11 J Race, Gender & Poverty 109. 5 Emma Dabiri, \u0091Black Pupils Are Being Wrongly Excluded over the Hair.

Following this, Section 3 analyses the EQA and the EHRC's guidance with reference to HD case law, arguing it provides insuYcient protection against HD. Section 4 assesses the United States of America's (USA) CROWN Act 2019, contending that it could provide a useful guide for the UK for understanding why HD requires legal protection. Building on this, Section 5 justi\u00aees the proposal to add \u0091hair\u0092 to the existing de\u00aenition of race in the EQA, focussing on systemic issues of race perception. Overall, this article suggests that education is a vital mechanism for a change in approach and concludes that, whilst it is crucial for students and employees to be educated through policy internal to professional institutions, this must be accompanied with legal action to guarantee recourse for HD victims. 2\u0001e Evolution of Hair Discrimination Focussing on its historical origins, this section explores the relationship between de\u00aenitions of HD in the legal literature and wider society and its in\u00afuences on current attitudes towards Black hair. Intrinsically linked to racial identity, Black hair is a distinctive feature separating those of Black heritage from other races. Recognising this, HD has been de\u00aened by Mbilishaka and others as: A social injustice characterized by unfairly regulating and insulting people based on the appearance of their hair. Within Black communities, hair discrimination can be localized as the imposition of racially biased appearance standards on hair, which can be accompanied by verbal or nonverbal consequences. 6 Discussions of HD must be attentive to its historical development. As 6 A\u00aeya M Mbilishaka and others, \u0091Don't Get It Twisted: Untangling the Psychology of Hair Discrimination within Black Communities\u0092 (2020) 90(2) Am J Orthopsychiatry 590. 110 York Law Review Dabiri observes, Afro-textured hair 7 and hairstyles are seen as an invaluable symbol of identity, family, age, tribe, and social rank within Black communities. 8\u0001e physical form of cornrows, for example, represents agriculture and order. Hairstyling knowledge is shared as a social activity, creating meaningful bonds between people. 9 Furthermore, it is important to note the importance of protective hairstyles. Black hair has the tendency to break and dry out, thus sometimes requiring protective hairstyles, including dreadlocks or braids, for the maintenance of healthy Black hair. 10\u0001ese shared practices, which have become embedded in tradition, were disrupted by the advent of \u00aefteenth-century slavery and colonialism. 11 Black hair was reclassi\u00aeed as \u0091dreadful\u0092, indicating the derogatory attitude of colonists towards Black people's hair. 12\u0001e term \u0091dreadlocks\u0092 originated in this period \u0097 a descriptor coined by slave owners. 13 Historic intrusions upon, and attitudes towards, Black culture set precedence for the continued negative (and internalised) perceptions of Black hair. 14 Despite the abolition of slavery, narrow attitudes of what is perceived as acceptable and ideal hair are perpetuated through the circulation of global de\u00aenitions of beauty, which are dominated by perennial racism. 15 Western European features associated with \u0091civility\u0092 and \u0091respectability\u0092 were held to be the standard and, 7 Thanks to Avtar Matharu, Chair of the University of \u0003ork's Staff Race Equality Forum and Committee for clarification of terminology. 8 Emma Dabiri, Don't Touch My Hair (Penguin Books 2019) 16. 9 Johnson (n 4). 10 Aleesha Hamilton, \u0091 Untangling Discrimination: \u0001e CROWN Act and Protecting Black Hair\u0092 (2021) 89 U Cin L Rev 483. 11 Editorial, \u0091We're Building a Future without Hair Discrimination\u0092 ( \u0001e Halo Collective , December 2020) <https://halocollective.co.uk/> accessed 8 December 2020. 12 Dabiri, Don't Touch My Hair (n 8). 13 Francesco Mastalia and Alfonse Pagano, Dreads (Artisan 1999). 14 Emma Dabiri, Twisted: \u0001e Tangled History of Black Hair Culture (Harper Collins 2020) 172. 15 ibid. 111 Volume \u0002 \u0097 Spring 2021 consequently, encouraged Black people to use straighteners and harsh chemicals to \u0091tame\u0092 their hair in an attempt to mirror European styles. 16 Since the emergence of the natural hair movement in the 1960s, Black people have been rejecting the Eurocentric standards of beauty that pressurise Black people to disguise and damage their natural hair. 17 Marcus Garvey, an activist of that movement, inspired Black people to embrace their natural hair, arguing that copying white Eurocentric standards of beauty \u0091denigrated the beauty\u0092 of Black people. 18 Nonetheless, Akutekha argues that the movement has failed Black people by encouraging the acceptability of Black hair \u0091only when it leans toward Eurocentric beauty standards\u0092. 19 Akutekha asserts that the movement's failure is due to the glamorisation of \u0091looser curls\u0092, limiting the acceptance of all Black hair types de\u00aened by their unique textures. 20 Given its history, HD lingers in the UK, particularly in professional environments. Demonstrative of this is Erogbogbo .21 Here, an African woman was informed that her short spiky plaits were unacceptable in the workplace, with her employer deeming them unprofessionally messy. Erogbogbo's claim for racial discrimination was upheld, as there was no objective justi\u00aecation for the employer's disapproval of her natural hair. Despite Erogbogbo's successful claim and the establishment of the EQA a decade later, there appears to have been no signi\u00aecant change in this period. 22 Tied to the existence of HD cases, 16 Mbilishaka and others (n 6). 17 Amberly Alene Ellis-Rodr\u00edguez, \u0091Black Is Beautiful: Photographs on the Hip Hop and Natural Hair Movements in Cuba Today\u0092 (2019) 21(4) Souls 355; Dabiri , Twisted: \u0001e Tangled Hair Culture (n 14). 18 Chant\u00e9 GriYn, \u0091How Natural Black Hair at Work Became a Civil Rights Issue\u0092 (Politics and Government, JSTOR Daily, July 2019) <https://daily.jstor.org/how- natural-black-hair-at-work-became-a-civil-rights-issue/> accessed 3 April 2021. 19 Esther Akutekha, \u0091How the Natural Hair Movement Has Failed Black Women\u0092 (Hu\u0003Post , 16 March 2020) <https://www.huYngtonpost.co.uk/entry/natural-hair- movement-failed-black-women_l_5e5\u0002246c5b6985ec91a4c70> accessed 5 April 2021. 20 ibid. 21Erogbogbo v Express UK Ltd [2000] ET/2200773/00. 22 Editorial, \u0091Boy \u0093Didn't Want to Be Black Anymore\u0094 after Being Sent Home from 112 York Law Review there remains a consistent problem concerning the understanding of racial discrimination. It is therefore necessary to question the protection that the Act o\u0002ers to victims of HD in the UK. 23 3\u0001e Current Ap proach in Practice Recognising the continued existence of such cases, the suYciency of the current approach towards protecting people against HD must be assessed, with particular focus on whether the law and guidance on HD misinterprets the understanding of racial characteristics. Described by Dabiri as \u0091the metric by which discrimination is measured\u0092, 24 the EQA replaced previous anti-discrimination laws, 25 attempting to simplify and unify equality law. 26 However, as Hand observes, this rationale may present an inherent shortcoming regarding the interpretation of the Act \u0097 particularly when its provisions are applied to complex issues such as HD. 27\u0001at is, because hair is not explicitly identi\u00aeed as an element of race within Act, there is a lack of awarenes s of HD being classed as a form of racial discrimination. \u0001e UK government has aimed to address the potential de\u00aeciencies of equality legislation by constructing the EHRC \u0097 a statutory body established by the Equality Act 2006 and whose remit was extended and reaYrmed in the Equality Act 2010. 28\u0001e EHRC 's purpose is to School for \u0093Too Short\u0094 Hair, Says Mum\u0092 ITV News (London, 17 May 2019) <https://www.itv.com/news/central/2019-05-17/boy-didnt-want-to-be-black-anymore- after-being-sent-home-from-school-for-too-short-hair-says-mum> accessed 4 January 2021. 23 Emma Dabiri, \u0091Emma Dabiri on Slaying the Stigma with the Halo Code\u0092 (Dove, April 2021) <https://www.dove.com/uk/stories/real-voices/emma-dabiri-halo- code.html> accessed 3 April 2021. 24 ibid. 25 Race Relations Act 1976. 26 James Hand, \u0091Outside the Equality Act: Non-Standard Protection from Discrimination of British Law\u0092 (2015) 15(4) Int'l J Discrimination & L 205. 27 ibid. 28 \u0091Our Powers\u0092 (Equality and Human Rights Commission, 12 November 2019) <https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/our-legal-action/our-powers> accessed 3 April 2021. 113 Volume \u0002 \u0097 Spring 2021 safeguard equality and human rights legislation through advice and guidance, as well as sometimes supporting relevant legal action. In the case of Williams, the chief executive of the EHRC observed potentially dangerous legal and social implications, stating that: \u0091policies which single out children from particular ethnic groups are unacceptable\u0092. 29 \u0001e Commission argued that the policy was indirectly discriminatory, placing Williams and other Black pupils at a disadvantage. It is therefore important to note the di\u0002erent types of discrimination that are recognised under the current law and guidance, and how this relates to the interpretation HD. 3.1 Direct and Indirect Discrimination Direct and indirect forms of discrimination are de\u00aened in the EQA and subject to guidance from the EHRC. 30 Direct discrimination occurs when one person is treated less favourably than another person in a comparable situation because of a protected characteristic. 31 If, for example, a Black man is not o\u0002ered employment due to his race, this constitutes direct discrimination. Contrastingly, indirect discrimination occurs when a provision, criterion or practice applies to all groups equally but has a discriminatory impact on people sharing a particular protected characteristic. 32 A health club that only accepts customers on the electoral register may, for example, be indirectly discriminating against Gypsies and Travellers, groups who are less likely to be on the electoral register and therefore will likely \u00aend it more diYcult to join. 33 29 Mark Smulian, \u0091School Argues \u00a38.5k Settlement to Pupil Excluded over Size of Afro\u0092 ( Public Law Today , 13 February 2020) <https://www.publiclawtoday.co.uk/education-law/394-education-news/42668- school-agrees-8-5k-settlement-to-pupil-excluded-over-size-of-afro-hair> accessed 4 April 2021. 30 Equality Act 2010, ss 13, 19 ; Editorial, \u0091What Is Direct and Indirect Discrimination?\u0092 (EHRC , 25 November 2019) <https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/advice-and- guidance/what-direct-and-indirect-discrimination> accessed 3 April 2021. 31 EQA, s 13. 32 EQA, s 19. 33 Citizens Advice Bureau, \u0091Gypsies and Travellers \u0097 Race Discrimination\u0092 ( Citizens Advice Bureau ) <https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and- 114 York Law Review 3.2 Case Law's Ignorance of Hair Discrimination Having identi\u00aeed the relevant types of discrimination, the following section details how indirect discrimination has been determined in case law, demonstrating the ignorance towards HD within judgments. \u0001e case of SG [2011] concerned a challenge to a school uniform policy that banned cornrows. 34\u0001e claimant was a Rastafarian whose religious beliefs prohibited him from cutting his hair. \u0001e H igh Court accepted that the policy indirectly discriminated against Black pupils, agreeing that the policy was not proportionate. 35 \u0003et, a signi\u00aecant part of the Court's reasoning relied upon a narrow exception to the claimant's hair, explaining that pupils who had a \u0091genuine cultural practice or family practice of not cutting hair\u0092 were to be regarded as an exception to the school's uniform policy. 36\u0001e court took a restricted approach towards the protection from indirect discrimination, rather than wholly dismissing the uniform policy as explicit racial discrimination. Despite SG demonstrating a successful advancement towards identifying discrimination, the Court's analysis does not explicitly consider HD a form of racial discrimination within its judgment. \u0001e public sector equality duty imposes a requirement on public authorities to have due regard to the need to inter alia eliminate discrimination and remove or minimise disadvantages su\u0002ered by persons who share a relevant protected characteristic when exercising its functions. 37 \u0003et, as Wagner observes, the consideration of HD issues was not made in SG.38\u0001e school assumed that HD was not a matter of courts/discrimination/protected-characteristics/gypsies-and-travellers-race- discrimination/> accessed 28 May 2021. 34SG v [2011] ACD Cornrows Alone \u0092 Blog June 2011) <https://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2011/06/20/hey-teacher-leave- those-cornrows-alone/> accessed 4 March (n 36). 115 Volume \u0002 \u0097 Spring 2021 concern, because there were no complaints regarding their questionable policy. Assessing the reasoning for the lack of complaints, the judge in SG noted: \u0091It may be that those who complied were prepared to accept the disadvantage to receive a place in an excellent establishment.\u0092 39\u0001is statement reiterates the notion that Black people are expected to conform to Eurocentric ideals in order to avoid being excluded from valuable educational opportunities. Overall, SG illustrates how schools or workplaces, when defending their establishment's policies, are actively involved in perpetuating the disadvantages that Black people face in professional environments, through their ignorance of HD. \u0001e Court's decision displays a misinterpretation of a uniform policy that re\u00afects the inherent nature of racial discrimination within an establishment's system. \u0001e next secti on discusses the implementation of the Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair Act (CROWN Act 2019), which recognises HD as a violation of human rights in parts of the USA, and o\u0002ers useful insights for the UK context. 4\u0001e CROWN Act 2019 \u0001e USA has recognised HD as a form of racial discrimination and has enacted legislation to tackle its prevalence in the country, in response to a rising number of cases. Seven states, including California, currently have anti-hair-discrimination laws, in the form of state-based CROWN Acts. \u0001 e federal CROWN Act was passed by the House of Representatives in 2020 and is now awaiting Senate approval. \u0001e Act prohibits discrimination based on natural hair texture, and the legal de\u00aenition of race has been expanded to include hair in several USA states. 40\u0001e de\u00aenition contained within the California Fair Employment and House Act, for example, now recognises: \u0091traits historically associated with race including, but not limited to, hair texture and protective hairstyles\u0092. 41 For Johnson, the formation of CROWN highlights the extent to which European traits have been normatively embedded into the perception of \u0091professional\u0092 appearance 39SG v St Gregory's Catholic Science College (n 34) [45] (Collins J). 40 CROWN Act 2019. 41 Fair Employment and Housing Act, California Government Code, s 12926(w). 116 York Law Review in society. 42 What is considered \u0091beautiful\u0092, \u0091acceptable\u0092, and \u0091professional\u0092 has undoubtedly been shaped by societal standards to which people have been exposed. 43\u0001e lack of representation of Black hair in the USA within facets of public life, and in mainstream social media, encourages the ignorance of Black people and their distinctive traits. Despite the approval of the CROWN Act from states that have acknowledged the misinterpretation of Black people, the Act has been rejected by others. 44\u0001e following section discusses the reasons for such opposition. 4.1 False Perceptions of Black Hair in Professional Environments \u0001is section discusses the common misconceptions of Black hair and hairstyles in professional environments, arguing that judgments in USA HD cases often dismiss Black hair or hairstyles as unprofessional. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v Catastrophe Management Solutions ( EEOC ) exempli\u00aees this. 45 In this case, heard in an Alabama Court in 2016, the claimant had been o\u0002ered a job at a call centre on the condition that she w ould not wear her dreadlocks. \u0001e employer stated that her dreadlocks were in violation of the grooming policy, which prohibited \u0091excessive hairstyles\u0092. 46\u0001e claimant refused, and the o\u0002er of a job was consequently revoked by the employer. 47\u0001e Alabama Court regarded dreadlocks as a mutable characteristic, concluding that the hairstyle was not indicative of a racial trait and that it has no relation to the claimant's racial background. 48\u0001e claimant 's 42 Johnson (n 4). 43 Johnson (n 4) 110. 44 Melissa A Milkie, \u0091 Social Comparisons, Re\u00afected Appraisals, and Mass Media: \u0001e Impact of Pervasive Beauty Imagines on Black and White Girls' Self-Concepts\u0092 (1999) 62(2) Social Psychology Quarterly 190; \u0091Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair\u0092 ( \u0001e CROWN Act ) <https://www.thecrownact.com/about> accessed 2 January 2021; Hamilton (n 10). 45EEOC v Catastrophe Management Solutions 852 F3d 1018 (11 Cir 2016). 46 ibid. 47 ibid. 48 Civil Rights Act 1964. 117 Volume \u0002 \u0097 Spring 2021 dreadlocks were classed by the court as a form of self-expression, an approach that denied the signi\u00aecance of the protective hairstyle. 49\u0001is case has set a narrow precedent that ultimately relied on \u00afawed federal discrimination law. 50 Within the context of HD in the USA, the \u00aendings in EEOC are signi\u00aecant for several reasons. First, the court misinterpreted Black hair, labelling it a mutable characteristic. 51\u0001is \u00aending stands in opposition to the history of Black culture and aYliated hairstyles. 52 As noted in Section 1, Black hair holds cultural signi\u00aecance for one's identity, whilst protective hairstyles are required to maintain healthy hair, due to Black hair's susceptibility to breakage and dryness. 53 Second, the case highlights how previous USA court decisions have facilitated a pattern through a narrow interpretation of racial discrimination, where protective hairstyles are dismissed as a mutable characteristic. 54 For example, in Rogers , a case decided in the Southern District of New \u0003ork in 1981, the Court held that an employer's grooming policy was not discriminatory, because cornrows were a \u0091mutable aesthetic choice\u0092. 55 Unlike in EEOC , the court here contrasted cornrows with \u0091Afro hairstyles\u0092, and found that the latter are acceptable. 56 Both cases demonstrate a judicial failure to comprehend the necessity of Black hairstyles, displaying an incoherent approach towards the nature of workplace policies. 57\u0001ese cases adopt 49 Michelle De Leon and Denese Chikwendu, Hair Equality Report 2019: \u0091 More \u0001 an Just Hair\u0092 (World Afro Day CIC, 2019). 50 Hamilton (n 10). 51 Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (n 46), \u0091protects persons in covered categories with respect to immutable characteristics, but not their cultural practices\u0092. 52 Hamilton (n 10). 53 Hamilton (n 10). 54 Hamilton (n 10) 497. 55Rogers v American Airlines, Inc 527 F Supp 229 (N\u0003 1981). 56 ibid. 57 Dawn Siler-Nixon and Cymoril White, \u0091 Diversity in Works: \u0001e Crown Act \u0097 a Root to End: Overview for Employers on Hair Discrimination Laws and the Impact on Employer Grooming Code\u0092 ( JD Supra 4 April 2021. 118 York Law Review inaccurate perceptions of Black hair and protective hairstyles as a fashion or aesthetic choice. For, whilst hairstyles can be fashionable, it is simply more practical and protective for some Black people to wear their hair in braids or dreadlocks. 58 4.2 \u0001e Impact of \u0001e CROWN Act in the United States of America \u0001e CROWN Act has created transformational change in parts of the USA, overcoming systemic barriers. 59 First, the Act has increased awareness of covert racism within establishments' policies, directly linking to the disproportionate treatment of Black people in such environments. 60\u0001e Act forms part of a movement to educate those who misinterpret HD as insigni\u00aecant, whilst also providing recourse for victims of HD. 61 Second, previous USA case law such as Rogers indicates that HD remains a divisive topic with no consensus on the identi\u00aecation and sanctioning of HD. \u0001e CROWN Act represents an opportunity for the country to develop consistent legal reasoning on a prevalent societal issue. With the Act's further growth as additional states consider its enaction, the country could see an eradication of the false narratives around HD, where such legislation has the ability to explicitly categorise HD as a form of racial discrimination. 62\u0001ird, the Act represents part of a social justice movement through the broadening of entitled minority rights, and serving to educate those not a\u0002ected by HD. 63 Drawing upon the relative successes of the USA's legislative action on HD, the penultimate section of this paper proposes that hair be added to the de\u00aenition of race as it is set out in the EQA within the UK. 58 George Driver, \u009121 Hairstyles and Hair Trends \u0003ou Need to Try in 2021\u0092 ( Elle, 11 December 2020) <https://www.elle.com/uk/beauty/hair/g32408/hairstyle-trends/> accessed 4 March 2021; Hamilton (n 10). 59 ibid. 60 ibid. 61 Siler-Nixon and White (n 57). 62\u0001e Crown Act (n 38 ); H amilton (n 10). 63 Hamilton (n 10). 119 Volume \u0002 \u0097 Spring 2021 5Why Should Hair Be Added? 5.1 Racist Policies and Hair as a Mutable Characteristic Formulated because of the prevalence of USA cases, and the incorrect notion that hair is a mutable characteristic, the challenges that CROWN addresses resonate clearly within the context of the UK. As such, legal reform, achieved through a re\u00aened de\u00aenition within the EQA, is necessary for several reasons. \u0001e \u00aerst justi\u00aecation for adding hair to the EQA race de\u00aenition emerges from the Williams case. Despite succeeding in claiming compensation based on HD, the case's outcome has been viewed as controversial among some commentators. 64 For instance, a prominent barrister, Jon Holbrook, argued that Williams's school's policy is \u0091not an instance of racism\u0092, asserting that the establishment believed that Williams had breached policy. 65 However, Holbrook's interpretation inherently misunderstands a policy that was systematically racist, wherein the school initially refused to accept that their policy had a discriminatory e\u0002ect. If an organisation bans Afro- textured hairstyles, such actions target people of Black heritage. 66 Views such as Holbrook's overlook the di\u0002erential impact of policies on certain hairstyles and, therefore, certain races, which in turn constitutes a form of indirect discrimination. Despite Williams' school's policy being revised, Holbrook's assertions continue to echo throughout UK society. 67 If explicit legal recognition of hair as an element of the Act\u0092s de\u00aenition of race is incorporated within the EQA, this could contribute to eliminating HD and its associated disadvantages. 64 Virk (n 1). 65 Jon Holbrook, \u0091Should School Uniform Policy Have to Accommodate Cultural Sensitivities?\u0092 ( \u0001e Conservative Woman , 25 January 2 April 2021. 66 Annie Fendrich, \u0091Why the Law on Indirect Discrimination Is So Vital in the Fight for Equality\u0092 ( Human Rights Pulse , 11 February 2021) <https://www.humanrightspulse.com/mastercontentblog/why-the-law-on-indirect- discrimination-is-so-vital-in-the-\u00aeght-for-equality-1> accessed 4 April 2021. 67 Virk (n 1 ); Justin Parkinson, \u0091Equality Debate Can't Be Led by Fashion, Says Minister Liz Truss\u0092 ( BBC News , 17 December 2020) <https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk- politics-55346920> accessed 3 January 2021. 120 York Law Review \u0001e second justi\u00aecati on for adding hair to the EQA's de\u00aenition of race derives from comments made in December 2020 by the UK's minister for women and equalities, Liz Truss MP.

Whilst initiatives such as the Halo Code represent a positive step towards the eradication of HD, the adoption and implementation of such provisions remain at the discretion of workplaces and schools' headteachers. 75\u0001e Code lacks a compulsory authority, which does not allow for the assurance of protection from HD. \u0001e recognition of hair as a characteristic feature of race within the EQA would help settle the issue of mutability and provide a route to redress for those faced with HD measures. 76 6Conclusion \u0001is paper has outlined the historical origins of HD, its connection to racism, and the consequent development of negative perceptions of Black hair in professional settings. \u0001e paper has suggested that there exists a gap in the understanding and de\u00aenition of race as it exists in the EQA. \u0001e existence of HD cases in the UK highlights ongoing discrimination within professional and educational establishments.

Opposition to the introduction of such legislation can often be explained by reference to persistent misconceptions surrounding Black hair and hairstyles, for instance, dismissing braids as unprofessional or mutable. Lessons can be learned from the Act within a UK context for establishing necessary rights and eradicating problematic attitudes within professional spaces. Existing eVorts to address HD within the UK are essential for education and in furthering the equality agenda beyond formal law. Most notably, the guidelines contained in the voluntary Halo Code were considered in this paper. However, these voluntary mechanisms must form part of a suite of measures that include legislative reform to ensure substantive recognition of HD and avenues for its victims to seek redress. \u0001e proposal put forward in this paper, that hair should be added to the de\u00aenition of race in the EQA, may achieve similar successes to the CROWN Act in the US, whilst also aiming to address racist misconceptions regarding the \u0091unprofessionalism\u0092 of Black hair and hairstyles. \u0001e examples of HD discussed in this paper demonstrate that our understandings of race and other characteristics must evolve and change over time as we understand and acknowledge past prejudices and failings.

Blowing the Whistle on the Iraq War: Conscientious Moral Objection and the Duty to Obey the Law Laura Burke Abstract \u0001is article explores whether there exists a duty to obey the law of a reasonably just state, even when doing so would violate an individual's moral beliefs. \u0001ere has been extensive discussion of legitimate authority, political obligation, civil disobedience, and the duty to obey over the past century. However, given the nature and scope of these topics, little clarity exists regarding the extent of any duty to obey the law and what protection the law should oVer to conscientious objectors. Using the contentious case of Katharine Gun, a translator at the Government Communication Headquarters who in 2003 leaked a con\u00aedential memo related to the Iraq invasion, the article interrogates whether moral obligation is ever a legitimate justi\u00aecation for legal disobedience. \u0001e circumstances under which Gun engaged in whistle -blowing force the society of the reasonably just state to consider whether, in some circumstances, moral conviction should be a valid legal defence against breaking some laws. Gun's case highlights the jurisprudential problems arising from imposing an absolute philosophical duty to obey the law. First, the article engages with the notion of a duty to obey, proposing that, whilst there is often good reason to do so, there is no absolute moral duty to obey the law. Second, it examines theories of conscientious objection and civil disobedience, establishing that, whilst there is no absolute right to conscientious objection, there exists scope for increased legal protection for those that disobey the law for moral reasons. Finally, it assesses the current state of law and policy in the United Kingdom on conscientious objection, oVering proposals for reform. 124 York Law Review 1Introduction \u0091\u0001ere comes a time when silence is betrayal. \u0092 \u0097 Martin Luther King Jr 1 Obedience to law in cases of moral con\u00afict is one of the most morally complex and pertinent discourses in legal philosophy. It cuts to the core of questions as to why we obey the law, whether we owe reasonably just states our obedience, and how far that obedience should extend. Conscientious objection and civil disobedience have been employed by civil society actors throughout political history as tools through which to challenge injustice, to invoke the public conscience, and to trigger legal reform. \u0001is article utilises the case of Katharine Gun as a lens through which to consider these concerns. \u0001e case of Katharine Gun provides a politically charged example of the tension between legal obedience and moral obligation. 2 Gun worked as a translator for the Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ) from 2001 to 2003, when she received a highly con\u00aedential memo revealing that the USA was working with the UK to collect sensitive information on members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), in order to illegally pressure states into supporting the Iraq invasion. 3 Gun's decision to leak the memo led to widespread 1 Martin Luther King Jr, \u0091Beyond \u0002ietnam\u0092 ( \u0001e Martin Luther King Jr Research and Education Institute, 4 April 1967) <https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king- papers/documents/beyond-vietnam> accessed 1 May 2020. 2 Paul Wood, \u0091 Katharine Gun: \u0001e Spy Who Tried to Stop the Iraq War \u0092 \u0001e Spectator (London, 14 September 2019). 3 Martin Bright and Ed \u0002ulliamy, \u009115 Years Later: How U.K. Whistleblower Katharine Gun Risked Everything to Leak Damning Iraq War Memo\u0092 ( Democracy Now , 19 July 2019) <https://www.democracynow.org/2019/7/19/15_years_later_how_uk_whistleblower> accessed 8 May 2021. 125 Volume \u0002 \u0097 Spring 2021 public outcry over the government's actions. 4 On 13 November 2003, she was charged with violating Section 1 of the O\u0003cial Secrets Act 1989, which government employees dealing with sensitive matters agree to abide by upon commencement of their employment. Her trial brought the con\u00afict between the citizen's legal and moral duties back into the heart of public and academic discourse. \u0001e legal case against Gun was ultimately dropped. \u0001e director of public prosecutions at the time, Sir Ken Macdonald, indicated that her prosecution would require the revelation of con\u00aedential government documents that would threaten national security. 5 As the case was not brought to trial, no de\u00aenitive answer was provided as to the legality of Gun's position, and particularly the defence of necessity, which her legal team intended to argue at trial. Gun's case reignited the debate as to whether the citizen's \u00aerst duty should be to the law or to personal morality. It forces us to consider if, even in a reasonably just state, certain moral compulsions can justify breaking laws. Employing a jurisprudential lens, this article analyses conscientious moral objection in the context of Gun's case. Utilising legal theory on the duty to obey the law and conscientious moral objection, it re- examines the current legal position of contemporary conscientious moral objectors. Whilst rejecting the argument that there is an absolute right to conscientiously disobey law, it will conclude that disobedience to law can have signi\u00aecant and compelling moral and practical justi\u00aecation. \u0001e article then argues that , if disobedience can be justi\u00aeed, then there must be a presumption in favour of giving it some form of legal recognition. Finally, the article oVers a view as to what form that legal recognition should take, favouring acknowledgement of a defence of necessity. 4 Tim Adams, \u0091Iraq War Whistle-Blower Katharine Gun \u0093Truth Always Matters\u0094\u0092 \u0001e Guardian 22 September 2019). 5 Mark Townsend, \u0091Iraq War Whistle-Blower's Trial Was Halted Due to National Securi ty \u0001reat \u0092 \u0001e Guardian (London, 1 September 2019). 126 York Law Review 2\u0001e Existence and Scope of a Duty to the Obey the Law In western legal philosophy, the debate as to whether there is a prima facie moral obligation to obey the law dates back to 360 BC, with Plato's discussion of Socrates in Crito .6 Socrates refuses to \u00afee Athens when faced with the death penalty because it would be morally wrong to forego the punishment imposed upon him by law, because he is morally obliged to abide with Athenian law as a citizen of Athens. Such a conclusion, that there exists a prima facie moral obligation to obey the law simply because it is the law, remains much debated in contemporary jurisprudence. 7 To assess the relationship between conscientious moral objection and legal obedience, the article \u00aerst engages with the contested existence of a prima facie moral obligation to obey the law. It concludes that, whilst there is often good reason to obey the law, those reasons cannot justify the claim that every citizen is duty-bound to obey every law, because such a moral duty does not exist. 2.1 \u0001e Concept of a Moral Obligation \u0001e concept of a moral obligation to obey the law is such that, \u0091in cases where the law requires X to do Y, it would be prima facie morally wrong for X not to do Y simply because the law requires it\u0092. 8\u0001is article will follow Simmons, Hart, and Rawls in adopting Brandt's paradigmatic use of the terms of \u0091obligation\u0092 and \u0091duty\u0092, treating the terms as broadly synonymous. 9 In the context of obedience to the law, these terms refer to \u0091moral requirements to act in certain ways in matters 6 Ernest J Weinrib, \u0091Obedience to the Law in Plato's Crito\u0092 (1982) 27 Am J Juris 85. 7 Nicholas J McBride and Sandy Steel, Jurisprudence (Palgrave 2014) 132. 8 ibid 133. 9 RB Brandt, Concepts of Obli 374. 127 Volume \u0002 \u0097 Spring 2021 relating to law and politics\u0092. 10 What distinguishes the specialised use of these terms is the coercive moral bond that an obligation places on an action. Simmons clari\u00aees the important distinction between \u0091moral\u0092 and \u0091positional\u0092 duties. 11 Simply put, something is a moral duty if it would be ipso facto morally wrong not to ful\u00ael that duty. Rawls terms these \u0091natural duties\u0092 that \u0091apply equally to all individuals irrespective of status\u0092. 12 Positional duties, by contrast, arise from roles or positions that the individual undertakes. \u0001e following analysis is concerned not with a positional duty to obey the law but with a moral one. In this context, the question of duty refers to whether law is morally authoritative and whether its subjects are morally obliged to comply because of its status as law. Crucially, a moral obligation is distinct from a coercive obligation, whereby X has authority over Y because X is capable of coercing Y to comply by punishing Y for non-compliance. In the case of coercion, punishment might give Y reason to comply, but this does not mean that there would be anything morally de\u00aecient about Y's refusal. 13\u0001is is ill ustrated in the debates between Hart and Austin. \u0001e \u0091imperative theory of the state\u0092, as espoused by Austin, dictates that human law is conceived of commands given by a political superior and enforced by coercive sanctions. 14 Under this theory, the law is authoritative because it has been created by a superior capable of imposing sanctions. Austin claimed that \u0091[c]ommand, duty and sanction are inseparably connected\u0092: a duty exists because of the command of the state, and such a duty is reinforced by the power to impose coercive sanctions. 15 However, Hart, in his seminal work, rejects this command model as failing to account for the internal thought processes of citizens 10 A John Simmons, Moral Principles and Political Obligations (\u00aerst published 1979, Princeton UP 2010) 12. 11 ibid. 12 John Rawls, A \u0001eory of Justice (Harvard UP 1971). 13 Daniel Mark, \u0091 \u0001e Failure of Joseph Raz's Ac count of Legal Obligation\u0092 (2016) 61(2) Am J Juris 217, 218. 14 John Austin, \u0001e Province of Jurisprudence Determined (\u00aerst published 1832, Prometheus 2000) 9\u009614. 15 ibid 17. 128 York Law Review who act out of a belief in a \u0091moral duty to obey the law\u0092 as opposed to being obliged by coercion. 16 An individual in the position to impose sanctions can indeed compel obedience, but Austin fails to address whether such authority is just and legitimate. Hart's rejection of command theory revolutionised the contemporary study of jurisprudence. 17 Hart demonstrates that the command model does not su\u0003ciently account for the law's content and function, and instead frames the debate in terms of whether a moral obligation to obey exists, from where it derives its authority, and whether it is binding on the citizen. For this reason, the \u0091duty to obey the law\u0092 as examined here focusses not on whether political authority can coerce behaviour via punishment but on whether the law of a reasonably just state has moral authority over its citizens, which in turn imposes a moral duty to obey the law. 2.2 Raz and the Duty to Obey \u0001e debate around a duty to obey the law has received signi\u00aecant academic scrutiny in recent decades. Joseph Raz's seminal work supported the conclusion that there is never an absolute moral duty to obey the law. 18 He persuasively questions the necessity, and the existence, of an absolute duty to obey, arguing that its existence depends on factors other than whether the law is just and sensible. His article convincingly concludes that any obligation is a prima facie one that can be overridden by a variety of countervailing considerations. 19 Raz's position is not that one never has any moral reason to account for the existence of the law but rather that the extent of the obligation to obey varies depending on factors such as the expertise or beliefs of the citizen, or the circumstance of the violation. \u0001e law aVects an individual's moral obligations but does not bind them. 16 HLA Hart, \u0001e Concept of Law (\u00aerst published 1961, Clarendon Press 2012) 6. 17 Mark (n 13) 218. 18 Joseph Raz, \u0091 \u0001e Obligation to Obey: Revision and Tradition \u0092 (1984) 1 Notre Dame J L Ethics & Pub Pol'y 139, 140. 19 ibid 147. 129 Volume \u0002 \u0097 Spring 2021 He opens his article by stating that political and moral theorists generally hold that each citizen has a prima facie moral duty to obey the laws of a reasonably just state. Several conditions for this theory of obedience require examination. \u0001ere is an argument that the obligation to obey is unjusti\u00aeable on the grounds that no state can be truly just. If obligation to obedience is dependent on the certainty of justice, and this guarantee is impossible, then no absolute obligation can be imposed. 20 Raz, however, proposes the \u0091paradox of just law\u0092, arguing that the presence of justice in fact diminishes the need for an absolute duty to obey. He argues that the more just and valuable the law is, the more reason the citizen has to conform to it and the less the need for a duty to obey becomes. 21 Since the law is just, the reasons that establish its justice should be the reasons for obedience. Individuals do not obey the law because of legal obligation but instead conform to the same doctrine of justice to which the law itself conforms. Since it is established that there only exists a duty to obey when the law is just, the duty to obey the law becomes redundant. 22 One of the most persuasive aspects of Raz's paradox theory is its application to the law on murder. \u0001e theory explains that society expects people to refrain from morally reprehensible actions regardless of whether they are legally forbidden, for reasons unrelated to the law. 23 If someone claimed that they do not murder because of the law, society would \u00aend that morally unacceptable. \u0001is raises the question of whether there can be a moral obligation to perform an action, if to take the existence of an obligation as the justi\u00aecation for the action would be morally wrong. Raz proposes that, because the existence of a \u0091duty to obey the law\u0092 does not strengthen the moral duty not to murder, then, in philosophical terms, a moral duty to obey is somewhat redundant. 24 \u0001e laws prohibiting murder, rape , and torture are central to the legal 20 Robert WolV, In Defence of Anarchism (\u00aerst published 1970, University of California Press 1998) 18. 21 Raz (n 18) 141. 22 Raz (n 18) 141. 23 Raz (n 18) 139, 141. 24 Raz (n 18) 140. 130 York Law Review systems of all just states. If these laws make little diVerence to our pre- existing moral obligations, then it logically follows that there is no absolute obligation to obey law on the basis that it is law. 2.3 Consent \u0001eory Arguably the most prominent justi\u00aecation for a duty to obey the law is consent theory. In the eighteenth century, Rousseau highlighted the value of the social contract as the act that constitutes civil society, and the notion of consent to the state has become popular as a justi\u00aecation for a duty to obey the law, as it aligns better with the principles of natural law. 25\u0001e cen tral doctrine of consent theory is that no individual is obligated to comply with any political power unless they have consented to its authority. 26 Raz agreed that \u0091[c]onsent to obey the law of a relatively just government indeed establishes a prima facie obligation to obey the law\u0092. 27 However, valid consent to obey requires a deliberate action, such as the oath taken in national military service, and in order to be binding it must be voluntarily undertaken. \u0001e central di\u0003culty with consent as the general foundation of political authority and, by extension, a duty to obey is that many people living under a state's laws have never performed any such action. Many theorists instead argue in favour of the implicit social contract \u0097 that individuals give their consent to obey implicitly by belonging to the state, accepting its bene\u00aets, and refraining from opposing the state. 28 However, the main problem with implicit consent as a justi\u00aecation for imposing a duty to obey the law is that valid consent requires a reasonable way of opting out. Implicit social contract theory utilises the acceptance of the bene\u00aets of the state as justi\u00aecation for a duty, yet these perceived bene\u00aets are given to a citizen regardless of whether they want them and, for many individuals, there is no reasonable way of opting out. 29\u0001erefore, 25 Jean-Jacques Rousseau, \u0001e Social Contract (\u00aerst published 1762, Everyman 1950); Raz (n 18) 153. 26 John Locke, Two Treatises of Government (\u00aerst published 1689, CUP 1960). 27 Joseph Raz, \u0091Authority and Consent\u0092 (1981) 67 \u0002a L Rev 103. 28 Michael Huemer, \u0001e Problem of Political Authority (Palgrave Macmillan 2013) 22. 29 ibid 24. 131 Volume \u0002 \u0097 Spring 2021 neither theory accounts for full and valid consent from all citizens, and so a blanket obligation to obey cannot be imposed on the grounds of consent. Other theorists have argued that an obligation to obey the law can arise from belonging to or identifying with a country or community as a form of consent. 30 However, whilst communal loyalty is a valuable aspect of a strong state, it is not obligatory. \u0001ere is no \u0091moral duty to feel a sense of belonging to a country or community\u0092 ; a feeling of loyalty that may trigger obedience to the state diVers sharply from a binding duty of loyalty to the state. 31 Raz argues that the law and government are \u0091organs of the community \u0092; if they accurately and justly represent the community, then an inclination to obey the law will arise. 32\u0001is is what Raz refers to as \u0091respect for law\u0092, a condition distinct from obligation. \u0001e notion of respect represents a desire to uphold a system based on a belief in that system. \u0001is is incongruous with obligation, which is a requirement placed upon the individual. 33 Obeying the law in this context is a way of expressing con\u00aedence in the state and trust in its justice. However, respect-based obedience does not derive from consent to the state \u0097 it develops because of belief in the state. 34 An obligation to obey due to loyalty to the state is a semi-voluntary obligation because it is a belief one has developed \u0097 an individual does not have a moral duty to identify with their community. Raz clari\u00aees that \u0091vindicating the existence of a sense of duty based on loyalty does not establish a general obligation to obey\u0092. 35\u0001e argument of voluntary consent to obey the laws of a state based on the communal value of that state can be used to explain compliance, but does not prove the existence of a prima facie moral obligation to obey. \u0001e community - based rationale fails to show that obedience to the law is an absolute 30 Raz, \u0091\u0001 e Obligation to Obey: Revision and Tradition \u0092 (n 18) 153. 31 Raz, \u0091\u0001 e Obligation to Obey: Revision an d Tradition\u0092 (n 18) 154. 32 Raz, \u0091\u0001 e Obligation to Obey: Revision and Tradition \u0092 (n 18) 154. 33 Simmons (n 10) 7. 34 Raz, \u0091\u0001 e Obligation to Obey: Revision and Tradition \u0092 (n 18) 154. 35 Raz, \u0091\u0001 e Obligation to Obey: Revision and Tradition \u0092 (n 18) 155. 132 York Law Review duty, but rather drives the alternate argument that it is a trust-based inclin ation. \u0001is argument suggests that the perception of justice is correlated with an inclination to obey. It follows that, if a citizen were to identify reason to distrust in the state and observe its injustice, that inclination towards respect-based obedience would diminish. 2.4 Finnis, Rawls, and the Duty to Obey Finnis disputes Raz's claim that compliance with the law is dependent on a variety of factors. He writes in favour of a signi\u00aecant duty to obey the law. Finnis's central claim is that the \u0091law is a seamless web: its subjects are not allowed to pick and choose\u0092. 36 Similarly, Rawls favours a natural duty to support just and e\u0003cient institutions, justi\u00aeed by reference to his social contract doctrine. He provides two main reasons why individuals should comply with just social arrangements. First, \u0091we have a natural duty not to oppose the establishment of just and e\u0003cient institutions\u0092. 37 Second, if we knowingly accept the state's bene\u00aets and expect others to, we are obliged to \u0091do our share\u0092 to maintain the social contract. 38 Echoing Finnis's notion of law as a \u0091seamless web\u0092, he states that \u0091[t]he injustice of a singular law is not a su\u0003cient ground for non- compliance any more than the legal validity of legislation is always a su\u0003cient ground for obedience\u0092. 39 He adds, \u0091justice binds us to a just constitution and the unjust laws that may be enacted in precisely the same way that it binds us to any other social arrangement\u0092. 40 Even in a relatively just society, Rawls contends, we cannot frame a procedure in which only just legislation is enacted. We must accept the risk of suVering injustice, providing it does not exceed certain limits, for the existence of a relatively just and e\u0003cient system. 36 John Finnis, \u0091 \u0001e Authority of Law in the Predicament of Contemporary Social \u0001eory \u0092 (1984) 1 Notre Dame J L Ethics & Pub Pol'y 115. 37 John Rawls, \u0091 \u0001e Justi\u00aecation of Civil Disobedience in Jail\u0092 in Aileen Kavanagh and John Oberdiek (eds), Arguing about Law (Routledge 2009) 244. 38 ibid 244. 39 ibid 246. 40 ibid 247. 133 Volume \u0002 \u0097 Spring 2021 However, Raz highlights that the fairness argument does not apply convincingly to all forms of disobedience to law. Even where it is unfair not to obey the law in some circumstances, it cannot be unfair to perform innocuous acts that do not impede the public good. 41 Many violations of law are innocuous acts; the refore, the argument of fairness cannot be used to justify a generalised obligation to obey. Whilst Rawls explains that the law is a way of achieving coordination and a relatively just system, he fails to demonstrate that such coordination requires the existence of an obligation to obey. 42 Equally, Raz refutes Finnis's proposal as incomplete because its justi\u00aecation for a duty to obey the law presupposes such a duty. \u0001e conception of the law as a \u0091seamless web that citizens cannot pick and choose between\u0092 only holds logical authority if there \u00aerst exists a justi\u00aeed and absolute prima facie duty to obey. It does not justify the duty ipso facto . One cannot presuppose that we have a duty to obey in order to provide the reason for that duty. \u0001is illustrates that the conception of the law as a seamless web is a personal belief; it is not a coherent theory that convincingly establishes a binding moral duty to obey. Finnis further argues that the only way to ensure that individuals ful\u00ael their moral duties is to enforce upon them a moral duty to obey the law. 43 He presents the following example: \u0091[a] farmer has a duty not to pollute the river, but the individual farmer may dispute this, so the logical way to get the collective to ful\u00ael their moral duty is to create a law and enforce a consequent moral duty to obey that law\u0092. 44 Raz persuasively contends that this only constitutes a coherent argument in favour of a general obligation to obey if the lawmakers are de\u00aenitively less likely to make mistakes than the farmers on all issues of law and morality. He explains that a generalised obligation to obey the law cannot ground its moral superiority in singular cases, because \u0091what is 41 Raz, \u0091\u0001 e Obligation to Obey: Revision and Tradition \u0092 (n 18) 152. 42 Rawls, \u0091 \u0001e Justi\u00aecation of Civil Disobedience in Jail \u0092 (n 37) 245. 43 Finnis (n 36) 134\u009637. 44 Finnis (n 36) 134. 134 York Law Review achieved in pollution could be lost in other areas of the law such as the treatment of the elderly or mentally ill\u0092. 45 Finnis illustrates a way in which the law can do good and uses this as justi\u00aecation for obliging obedience to the law. However, Raz does not dispute that, when the law can do good, it should be obeyed. Finnis's argument in favour of an obligation to obey does not logically refute Raz's scepticism of its existence. Raz refutes the proposition that there is a moral danger in people deciding for themselves, such that a duty to obey is necessary. Raz agrees that \u0091human judgmen t fails; it is distorted by temptations, error and bias\u0092. 46\u0001is should, Raz agrees, colour the debate, but it should not necessarily incline in favour of an absolute duty to obey since \u0091[p]oliticians, governments and lawmakers are not exempt from human error\u0092. 47 By extension, human law is not exempt from problems and so its power to demand obedience should not be absolute. He adds that, \u0091too often in the past, the fallibility of human judgment has led to submission to authority from a misguided sense of duty where this was a morally reprehensible attitude\u0092. 48 As long as there exists no conviction that the decision of the state will always be correct, or moral, an absolute duty would be not only misguided but, if its purpose were to enhance civil society, also redundant. Raz raises the only persuasive answer to this conundrum, and to the fallibility of human law \u0097 that the existence of a duty to obey is conditional. \u0001is article supports Raz 's conclusion that \u0091there are risks, moral and other, in uncritical acceptance of authority\u0092. 49 Raz persuasively demonstrates that imposing an absolute duty prevents the citizen from being able to critically assess the law and its moral facets, make rational decisions based on circumstance, and utilise agency. He convincingly dismantles other scholars' arguments and presents a logical and 45 Raz, \u0091\u0001e Obli gation to Obey: Revision and Tradition\u0092 (n 18) 151. 46 Raz, \u0091\u0001 e Obligation to Obey: Revision and Tradition \u0092 (n 18) 151. 47 Raz, \u0091\u0001 e Obligation to Obey: Revision and Tradition \u0092 (n 18) 151. 48 Raz, \u0091\u0001 e Obligation to Obey: Revision and Tradition \u0092 (n 18) 151. 49 Raz, \u0091\u0001 e Obligation to Obey: Revision and Tradition \u0092 (n 18) 151. 135 Volume \u0002 \u0097 Spring 2021 coherent case in opposition to a duty to obey the law. \u0001is article therefore argues that, if the proposition in favour of a prima facie duty to obey presupposes that obeying the law is the morally right thing to do, its existence should vary between circumstances and be dependent on the laws in question, the consequences of obedience, and the knowledge of the citizen. 50 In some situations the correct choice requires submission to authority, and in others it leads to denial of authority. 51 Enforcing an absolute duty to obey would oversimplify the complexity of the relationship between law and morality, and, as Raz notes, there is no conclusive evidence that it would aid society. Raz concludes his article by arguing that there is a clear orthodoxy of modern legal and political theory, which claims that, if there is an obligation to obey the law, it exists because it is voluntarily undertaken. 52 Since any obligation that is voluntarily undertaken cannot be absolute, the duty to obey the law is conditional and does not morally bind the citizen. \u0001at is the view that Raz defended and that this article supports. 3Obedience to the Law in Cases of Moral Con\u00afict Changes in societal perspectives in the twentieth century led to a rise in protests, activism, and conscientious objection. \u0001is encouraged a process of legal reform that changed the face of law in the United Kingdom and gave rise to a wave of theorists arguing in favour of the citizen's right to dissent against laws that they \u00aend morally objectionable. WolV's In Defence of Anarchism set a precedent for this school of thought. WolV proposed that a law being passed is \u0091never a reason which deserves to be given any particular weight in our deliberations\u0092. 53 Equally, Simmons urges the citizen not to regard a legal requirement as the sole reason to act, arguing that the simple fact 50 Raz, \u0091\u0001 e Obligation to Obey: Revision and Tradition \u0092 (n 18) 151. 51 Raz, \u0091\u0001 e Obligation to Obey: Revision and Tradition \u0092 (n 18) 151. 52 Raz, \u0091\u0001 e Obligation to Obey: Revision and Traditi on\u0092 (n 18) 155. 53 WolV (n 20). 136 York Law Review that conduct is required or forbidden by law is irrelevant to its moral status. He suggests that, even within relatively just states, citizens should consider the morality of an action on independent grounds. 54 Whilst the majority of theorists disagree with WolV's claim that law never provides a valid reason for acting, his argument shapes the belief that the law is not always a good reason for acting and so by extension is non-binding on the citizen's moral choices. 55\u0001us, theories of conscientious objection began to gain popularity in modern political theory. \u0001ese theories of conscientious objection borrow concepts from the \u0001omist tradition of natural law. \u0001is theory centres on a twofold contention: \u00aerst, that there are certain inalienable principles of true morality and, second, that man-made laws that con\u00afict with these principles are invalid law, \u0091 lex iniusta non est lex \u0092. 56\u0001is Latin motto, originating from St Augustine and used by St \u0001omas Aquinas, was popularised by Martin Luther King Jr during the civil rights movement and used as a way to articulate the justi\u00aecation of conscientious disobedience. 57\u0001e argument a gainst a duty to obey does not propagate the natural law theory that laws that con\u00afict with certain fundamental principles of morality are not law at all. Rather, it establishes that the existence of something in law does not morally bind an individual to action. \u0001e concept of conscientious moral objection in this context is that, if the law is in fundamental con\u00afict with an individual's moral beliefs, then this moral objection justi\u00aees disobedience. In order to assess the position of conscientious whistle-blowers like Katharine Gun, it is \u00aerst necessary to critically analyse the concept of conscientious disobedience and the legal and philosophical validity of the claim that moral objection is a justi\u00aeable reason to break the law. 54 Simmons (n 10) 8. 55 Patrick Durning, \u0091 Joseph Raz and \u0001e Instrumental Justi\u00aecation of a Duty to Obey the Law\u0092 (2003) 22 L & Phil 597. 56 Hart (n 16) 156. 57 Martin Luther King Jr, \u0091Letter from Birmingham Jail\u0092 in Aileen Kavanagh and John Oberdiek (eds), Arguing about Law (Routledge 2009). 137 Volume \u0002 \u0097 Spring 2021 \u0001is section examine s civil disobedience and conscientious objection through a jurisprudential lens, arguing that the legal system of the relatively just state should provide some form of legal protection to those who conscientiously disobey law. 3.1 Examining a Moral Duty to Disobey \u0001e question of the obligation to obey laws that one morally opposes extends beyond the issue of whether there is a prima facie moral obligation to obey the law and also addresses the moral justi\u00aecation for disobedience. Smith asserts that \u0093[a] person (S) has a prima facie obligation to do an act (X) if there is a moral reason for S to do X\u0092. 58 \u0001e fact that the act is law could be such a moral reason. Smith continues that, \u0091unless [they have] a moral reason not to do so at least as strong as [their] reason to do so, failure to do X is wrong\u0092. 59\u0001is argument posits that, even if a law does provide a moral obligation to act, failure to obey this obligation is only wrong insofar as one lacks su\u0003cient moral justi\u00aecation for disobedience. Raising the concept of proportionality, he suggests that disobedience to law is morally acceptable insofar as the moral consideration is su\u0003cient to render disobedience to law a proportionate act. Simmons argues that, if society does not accept obligation as a justi\u00aecation for behaviour that violates our fundamental morality, then we cannot justi\u00aeably impose an obligation to obey the law regardless of countervailing moral considerations, as to do so would be contradictory. Simmons notes that we are \u0091unmoved by the Nazi O\u0003cer's pleas, even if we acknowledge that he did have a form of obligation to obey his superior's commands to kill innocent people\u0092. 60 \u0001e reason for this lack of sympathy is a collective recognition of the 58 MBE Smith, \u0091 Is \u0001 ere a Prima Facie Obey the Law? \u0092 (1973) 82(5) Yale LJ 950, 951. 59 ibid. 60 Simmons (n 10) 10. 138 York Law Review fact that duties and obligations do not give conclusive reasons for acting \u0097 there is a moral facet to the decision to carry out these orders. 61 If the duty to obey the law is a moral obligation, as its proponents would suggest, then it appears illogical that an individual would recognise the law's moral claim over their actions without also acknowledging that this claim is overridden by many more substantial moral considerations. 62\u0001is argument convincingly illustrates that some factors take moral precedence above legal duty. \u0001is is the purpose of conscientious moral objection and represents the grounds on which a legal recognition of moral considerations would rest. In the context of political obligations, this demonstrates that to identify that an individual has an obligation is not to say that they ought to, or are in any moral sense bound to, discharge that obligation. 63 To hold an absolute duty on the grounds of moral obligation would be contradictory if the same obligation bound individuals to deny countervailing moral considerations. It follows from this conclusion that, if it is not the case that the legality of an action exempts it from all moral scrutiny, then the illegality of an action does not render it the morally wrong choice. 64 It is important to distinguish conscientious moral objection from civil disobedience. For the purposes of this analysis, Raz's de\u00aenitions will be employed. Civil disobedience refers to a \u0091politically motivated breach of law designed to contribute directly to a change of law or public policy, or to express one's protest against a law or public policy\u0092. 65 Conscientious moral objection is a personal breach of the law because the agent is morally prohibited to obey it. 66\u0001e two often overlap \u0097 for instance, an individual can protest against a law in the hope of policy reform because they are personally morally prohibited from obeying 61 Simmons (n 10) 10. 62 James K Mish'alani, \u0091Duty, Obligation and Ought\u0092 (1969) 30(2) Analysis 33. 63 Simmons (n 10) 11. 64 JW Harris, Legal Philosophies (\u00aerst published 1997, OUP 2004) 226. 65 Joseph Raz, \u0001e Authority of Law (\u00aerst published 1979, OUP 2009) 263. 66 ibid. 139 Volume \u0002 \u0097 Spring 2021 that law. Both forms of conscientious objection share the characteristic belief that obeying the law would be a greater moral wrong than disobeying. 3.2 Is \u0001 ere a Right to Dissent? Raz suggests that a right to conscientious disobedience would include within it the right to do something that the law dictates should not be done, because that individual sincerely holds opposing moral views. Take the example of military service \u0097 even if the military service can be morally justi\u00aeed, an individual would be allowed to opt out because they ardently believe it is wrong for them. \u0001e argument proposes that, \u0091even if performing the action would, disregarding the agent's attitude towards it, be morally obligatory, it may not be so once their attitude is accounted for\u0092. 67\u0001is suggests that, in a liberal society, the moral beliefs of the agent add a moral facet to obliging them to act, even if the act itself is otherwise morally positive or morally neutral . \u0001e agent 's personal moral beliefs may tip the balance. \u0001e legal protection of those who disobey the law for moral reasons, if it were to exist, would rest on respect for the individual's moral beliefs and the seriousness of these beliefs in situations of moral complexity. However, the legal acknowledgement of the gravity of the individual's moral beliefs in situations of moral complexity does not automatically equate to the proposition of an absolute right to dissent. In his discussion of civil disobedience, Raz distinguishes between the assertion that civil disobedience is an individual's absolute right and the claim that, under certain conditions, civil disobedience is a morally right choice. 68 A characteristic of rights is that a right contains within it the protection of the freedom to do what one ought not to do. For example, the right to freedom of expression (subject to a small number 67 ibid 278. 68 ibid 267. 140 York Law Review of restrictions) extends to the right to say what one ought not to say. 69 Raz identi\u00aees that this cannot logically extend to conscientious disobedience, as to have a right to conscientiously disobey when one ought not to do so would be to contradict the very de\u00aenition of conscientious disobedience, which is dependent on the moral conditions of the disobedience. To say that there is a right to conscientiously disobey law is to suggest that the legitimacy of conscientious disobedience is not dependent on the rightness of one's cause. 70 \u0001is position does not mean that civil disobedience and conscientious moral objection are never justi\u00aeed, but that it would be inaccurate to assume that disobedience on the grounds of conscience is an absolute right. Instead, it proposes that, because the liberal state has the capacity to contain bad and iniquitous laws, sometimes it will be morally right to engage in a form of conscientious disobedience to protest against them. Conscientious objection and civil disobedience are, by their characteristics, exceptional: they go beyond the bounds of the law and so extend beyond the protected right to political action. 71 Hence, this article proposes that conscientious disobedience is a form of political action to which no one has an absolute moral right but to which individuals may have su\u0003cient moral justi\u00aecation. It therefore argues in favour of a legal defence of necessity that acknowledges at trial the moral seriousness of the conscientious objector's decision to disobey. It does not equate this to an absolute philosophical right to disobey, as this would be incompatible with the nature and purpose of civil disobedience and conscientious objection. 69 HLA Hart, \u0091Bentham and Legal Rights\u0092 in AWB Simpson (ed), Oxford Essays in Jurisprudence (OUP 1973). 70 Raz, \u0001e Authority of Law (n 65) 268. 71 Raz, \u0001e Authority of Law (n 65) 275. 141 Volume \u0002 \u0097 Spring 2021 3.3 A Defence of Civil Disobedience Even if we accept that there is no absolute right to civil disobedience, it remains a concept worthy of recognition. In Taking Rights Seriously , Dworkin emphasises the importance of distinguishing between civil disobedience and lawlessness. 72 He identi\u00aees the common argument in favour of treating the conscientious moral objector in the same way as the prima facie oVender. \u0001is argument is based on the apparent trui sm that the law must be enforced because it is the law and so, even if disobedience to the law is morally justi\u00aeed, it cannot be legally justi\u00aeed. 73 He identi\u00aees Erwin Griswold's statement, during a speech given in his capacity as solicitor-general, that: \u0091It is the essence of law that it is equally applied to all, that it binds all alike, irrespective of personal motive. For this reason, one who contemplates civil disobedience should not be surprised if a criminal conviction ensues.\u0092 74 Griswold adds that \u0091organised society cannot endure on any other basis\u0092. 75 Dworkin analyses the two main arguments raised by this position: \u00aerst, that \u0091society cannot endure\u0092 if it tolerates all disobedience. He notes that, whilst this may be the case, this argument has little weight in opposition to civil disobedience in particular, because there is no evidence to suggest that society will collapse if it tolerates some disobedience. Dworkin states that there are many \u0091good reasons\u0092 that a prosecutor considers when deciding not to prosecute an individual for an oVence. Such reasons suggest that society does, to an extent, tolerate some disobedience. \u0001ere are prima facie good reasons for not prosecuting those who disobey laws based on questions of conscience. \u0001ere is an a rgument that society would suVer if it prosecuted moral, loyal, and normally law-abiding citizens who 72 Ronald Dworkin, Taking Rights Seriously (\u00aerst published 1977, Duckworth 1978) 206. 73 ibid. 74 ibid. 75 ibid. 142 York Law Review conscientiously object, as this would alienate those individuals and reduce the collective belief in the justice of that state. 76 Second, Dworkin addresses the equal treatment argument Griswold raises, that the law applies equally to all, meaning it is unfair to make exception for those who morally disagree. Dworkin identi\u00aees the critical \u00afaw in this argument: it contains the hidden assumption that dissenters are knowingly breaking a valid law and that they assert an unfair privilege to do so. Dworkin convincingly argues that proponents of this view fail to see the complexity of the connection between legal and moral issues. \u0001is reasoning distorts the cr ucial fact that the substantive validity of the law may be doubtful or debated, even if it is enacted in a procedurally legitimate manner. Government o\u0003cials may believe that the law is substantively valid, and dissenters may believe it is invalid, and both may have legitimate legal and philosophical justi\u00aecations informing their positions. 77 It is reductionist to suggest that all legal issues have a singular valid moral standpoint. Since the question of the law's substantive validity in these circumstances is debatable, the fairness argument is irrelevant, given that it rests upon the certainty of valid law. Dworkin illustrates the positive bene\u00aets that society gains from individuals following their own moral judgement. He proposes that an individual operating upon their own legitimate understanding of the law or morality provides a means of testing relevant hypotheses in uncertain areas of legal and moral discourse. He eVectively argues that in some areas it is unreasonable to impose a burden of obedience on those who dissent. \u0001is includes cases where the law is uncertain, to the extent where lawyers reasonably disagree about what courts ought to decide, or where morality is uncertain, to the extent that citizens can reasonably disagree about what constitutes the moral course of action. Dworkin's article highlights the societal disadvantages of refusing to accept some forms of conscientious disobedience. It convincingly demonstrates that, if society were to force its citizens to accept the status quo when the 76 ibid 207. 77 ibid 207. 143 Volume \u0002 \u0097 Spring 2021 validity or morality of the law is in question, then society would lose its chief vehicle for social progress and \u0091over time the law we obeyed would become less fair and just, and the liberty of our citizens would be diminished\u0092. 78\u0001is highlights on e of the critical arguments in favour of civil disobedience: that it is a necessary tool for social progress. \u0001is argument is exempli\u00aeed through Katharine Gun's case in the following section. Despite supporting a general obligation to obey the law of just and e\u0003cient systems, Rawls argues that such a duty does not prevent the individual from engaging in civil disobedience. \u0001is account is critical because it highlights that the belief in a general obligation to obey is not prima facie incompatible with theories of conscientious disobedience. Rawls argues that, \u0091[i]f in the individual's judgment the actions of the law, state or majority exceed certain bounds of injustice, then the citizen may consider civil disobedience\u0092. 79 Rawls convincingly dismantles the counterargument that civil disobedience is incompatible with respect for law, proposing that, when civil disobedience is a conscientious, public, and non-violent act based upon a sincere moral conviction, it in fact manifests a principled respect for legal procedures entirely compatible with the values of the liberal state. 80 Similarly, in his \u0091Letter from a Birmingham Jail\u0092, Martin Luther King Jr stated that \u0091an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust [ ] in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for the law\u0092. 81\u0001ese viewpoints diminish the argument that civil disobedience and respect for the establishment are ipso facto incompatible. \u0001ese arguments persuasively demonstrate that insofar as it satis\u00aees the condition of nonviolence, and where other options of legal obedience or political appeal have been exhausted or are unavailable, then civil disobedience could be justi\u00aeed, even in a relatively just state. 78 ibid 212. 79 ibid 247. 80 ibid 248. 81 Martin Luther King Jr, \u0091Letter from Birmingham Jail\u0092 (n 57) 258. 144 York Law Review \u0001e above analysis has outlined the conditions under which legitimate and compelling moral objection to the law may arise. It demonstrates the circumstances in which civil disobedience is not only justi\u00aeed but of genuine and substantial bene\u00aet to civil society. It therefore concludes that to prosecute conscientious dissenters to the same extent as the prima facie oVender would not be a true re\u00afection of culpability. 4Conscientious Objection in the Case of Katharine Gun \u0001e \u00aenal section of this article considers the extent to which the legal system of a liberal state should acknowledge the individual's right to break the law for moral reasons. First, it explores the case of Katharine Gun, the circumstances of her conscientious objection, and its contested legitimacy. Gun's case reopened the conversation regarding the citizen's ability to object to actions of the state, even in circumstances where the means of that objection are illegal. Within this, it examines the concept of a \u0091defence of necessity\u0092, which Gun's legal team intended to argue. Second, this section analyses the current legal position in the UK of those who break the law for moral reasons. Using Gun's case, it demonstrates that the law does not provide su\u0003cient protection to individuals in these circumstances and argues in favour of acknowledging the defence of necessity. 4.1 \u0001e Case of Katharine Gun \u0001e case of Katharine Gun represents an instance of conscientious disobedience at the interface of civil disobedience and conscientious moral objection. Gun did not disobey the O\u0003cial Secrets Act because it was prima facie morally bad law, nor did she necessarily intend to make legal change. However, her decision to leak the memo to the public, on the grounds that she could not in good conscience remain silent, contravened the O\u0003cial Secrets Act to which she was bound and 145 Volume \u0002 \u0097 Spring 2021 had the potential to derail the legitimacy of the Iraq invasion. 82 Simeck argues that, \u0091[w]histle-blowers are neither \u0093disloyal\u0094 nor \u0093heroes\u0094 but rather individuals who \u00aend themselves at the crux of a moral impasse and are forced to make an ethical decision they can consciously stand by\u0092. 83 Similarly, Delmas argues that, \u0091[g]overnment whistleblowing should be viewed along the lines of civil disobedience as a collective cognition and legitimacy enhancing device\u0092. 84 Gun's actions in these circumstances invoked the collective conscience to question, and by extension enhance, the accountability of government. Not only did Gun's actions give rise to questions regarding the validity of the law that prevented her from whistle-blowing ; they also opened a public debate on the legality of the actions of government in the Iraq invasion. Her decision led to a crucial re-examination of the relationship between the citizen and the state and the potential for arbitrary misuse of government power. 85 A growing section of the public supported her decision. Indeed, the information released regarding the potential illegitimacy of the Iraq invasion caused international uproar. 86\u0001e consequences of Gun's decision transcended the legal rami\u00aecations facing Gun herself and fuelled the social, political, and legal discourse surrounding the legality of the Iraq War. 87\u0001e disclosure informed the public about an act of government that threatened principles of justice and democracy and led to a rise in public distrust of the government. 88 82 Norman Solomon, \u0091To Stop War, Do What Katharine Gun Did\u0092 ( Consortium News , 8 March 2018) Gabrielle Simeck, \u0091 Five \u0001 ings Not to Do If You Want to Be a Successful National Security Whistle-Blower\u0092 ( Government Accountability Project , 8 August 2019) <https://whistleblower.org/blog/\u00aeve-things-not-to-do-if-you-want-to-be-a-successful- accessed 8 May 2021.

Her case exempli\u00aees Dworkin's theory that civil disobedience can engender social progress and highlights the role of the conscientious objector in enhancing justice within the liberal state. \u0001ere is, therefore, justi\u00aecation for the proposition that her decision to leak the memo, detailing the decision to place illegal pressure on the UNSC to allow the invasion of Iraq, represented a legitimate, appropriate, and important example of civil disobedience. \u0001e role of a \u0091political obligation\u0092 is de\u00aened by Simmons as a special kind of obligation that binds the citizen to the state with speci\u00aec pressure to perform, distinguishing it in political philosophy from other forms of moral judgement. 89\u0001e special role of such an obligation is most distinct in \u0091moral dilemmas\u0092. 90 Gun's case is an example where such con\u00aficting obligations arose. Gun had a legal obligation not to disclose the memo on the grounds that it was an o\u0003cial secret and a matter of national security, while disclosure also violated her responsibilities as a GCHQ translator. However, Gun's belief in the seriousness of the humanitarian issue of a potentially illegal war, coupled with the illegality of placing pressure on the UNSC, provided strong moral compulsion not to discharge the obligation to remain silent. Gun believed that the government was acting illegally and that this illegal act could lead to an illegal war, which in consequence could lead to the unjusti\u00aeed deaths of thousands. \u0001is was a belief based on legitimate grounds, and the moral weight of this consideration cannot be overlooked. 91 Leaving aside the question of whether she acted rightly or wrongly, there cannot be any doubt that Gun was faced with a moral dilemma. Raz's account of conscientious objection and the capacity to remove oneself from morally contentious dilemmas, discussed below at Section 4.3, therefore does not su\u0003ciently account 89Simmons (n 10) 7; CH Whiteley, \u0091On Duties\u0092 53 95. 90 EJ Lemmon, \u0091Moral Dilemmas\u0092 (1962) 71(2) Phil Rev 139. 91 Adams (n 4). 147 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 for the complexity of situations such as Gun's. Considering the nature of the moral dilemma, a conclusion that Gun should not have been morally bound to the O\u0003cial Secrets Act is persuasive. Such a conclusion is justi\u00aeed by reference to theory regarding the legitimacy of civil disobedience and the lack of a compelling argument in favour of an absolute duty to obey in situations of profound moral con\u00afict. Had her case moved forward, Gun's legal team intended to argue a \u0091defence of necessity\u0092 justifying her decision to act in contravention of the O\u0003cial Secrets Act. \u0001is defence is based on the argument that in situations of profound moral complexity where the agent is compelled to disobey for substantive moral reasons, it is unfair to hold them as culpable as the prima facie oVender. \u0001e nature of this defence aligns with the above theory. Section 2 established that there is no binding moral duty that tied Gun to the O\u0003cial Secrets Act and proposed that the agent should be able to assess the moral facets of their individual situation when deciding whether or not to obey. Section 3 clari\u00aeed that there exists no guarantee that legal action is moral action purely on the basis of its legality. It is therefore submitted that the moral considerations outlined in the case of Katharine Gun represent su\u0003cient moral justi\u00aecation as a defence for disobedience. Where moral dilemmas of similar complexity arise in future, such considerations should be acknowledged in a court's assessment of blameworthiness in the legal system of the liberal state. \u0001is is explored subsequently. 4.2 \u0001e Current Legal Status of Conscientious Objection Having directly addressed the core questions as to the existence of a moral duty to obey the law and the philosophy of conscientious objection, the article now discusses the current legal status of conscientious objectors in the UK. \u0001e UK oVers some legislative protecti on for a right to conscientiously object. \u0001is is primarily limited 148 York Law Review to areas of moral complexity and discourse within medical law. 92 For example, Section 4(1) of the Abortion Act 1967 protects the right to refuse participation in terminations of pregnancy, other than where it is necessary to save the life of, or prevent grave injury to, the pregnant woman. Similarly, Section 38 of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 prevents any duty being placed on an individual to participate in activity govern ed by the Act. \u0001e basis for these exemptions is a legal acknowledgement that participation in such procedures may violate some individuals' moral beliefs. \u0001e law in these instances deems the moral objection to be su\u0003ciently substantive and the area to be su\u0003ciently divisive to refrain from imposing a positive obligation to participate on the medical practitioner. However, there exists no protected \u0091right to conscientious objection\u0092 in British or international law. Article 9(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, does not explicitly refer to a right to conscientious objection. 93\u0001is has been clari\u00aeed in a number of cases under the Convention, such as Gandrath v Germany and G.Z v Austria .94 In both cases, the applicant appealed to a right to conscientiously object in order to be exempted from military service or substitute civilian service. However, the European Commission of Human Rights held that conscientious objectors did not have an absolute right to exemption from military service on the basis of Article 9 and that each contracting state could decide whether to grant such a right. 95 Article 9 is subject to \u0091the limitations prescribed necessary by law in a democratic society\u0092. 96 \u0001is arrangement is brought into UK domestic law by Article 9 of the 92 Editorial, \u0091Conscientious Objection\u0092 ( Medical Defence Union , 7 February 2020) <https://www.themdu.com/guidance-and-advice/guides/conscientious-objection> accessed 10 May 2020. 93 Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (European Convention on Human Rights, as amended) (ECHR) Art 9. 94Gandrath v Germany App no 2299/64 (Commission Decision, 12 December 1966); G.Z v Austria App no 5591/72 (Commission Decision, 2 April 1973). 95 ibid Gandrath v Germany . 96 ECHR Art 9. 149 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 Human Rights Act 1998. 97\u0001is jurisprudence clari\u00aees that the prima facie right to freedom of conscience does not include the right to break the law on the grounds of conscience. However, the court leaned in favour of the conscientious objector in the more recent European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) judgment in the case of Bayatyan v Armenia . 98 It found that opposition to military service, where it is motivated by \u0091a serious and insurmountable con\u00afict between the obligation to serve and a person's conscience or his deeply and genuinely held religious or other beliefs\u0092 constitutes a \u0091belief of su\u0003cient cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance\u0092 to attract the guarantees of Article 9. 99\u0001e ECtHR concluded that the question of whether the conscientious objection falls within the ambit of the provision is a matter that requires assessment of the particular case. 100 Whilst the court maintains that no \u0091right to conscientious objection\u0092 is protected, it has leaned in favour of the conscientious objector in cases where the circumstances of the objection and the belief held are of \u0091su\u0003cient cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance\u0092. 101 \u0001e judgment in the Bayatyan case demonstrates a positive movement within the ECtHR jurisprudence towards ruling in favour of the conscientious objector under some circumstances. \u0001e court acknowledged the seriousness of the moral beliefs held by the conscientious objector and argued that they cannot be dismissed as marginal when obliging the individual to act. 102\u0001e current law on conscientious objection remains uncertain. However, this judgment provides some scope to expand the legal protections aVorded to the 97 Human Rights Act 1998, sch 1, art 9. 98Bayatyan v Armenia App no 23459/03 (ECtHR, 7 July 2011). 99 Editorial, \u0091Factsheet \u0097 Conscientious Objection\u0092 ( European Court of Human Rights , March 2020) <https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Conscientious_objection_ENG.pdf> accessed 8 May 2021. 100 ibid. 101 ibid. 102Bayatyan v Armenia (n 98). 150 York Law Review conscientious objector and consequently leaves the law at a crucial turning point for the future of conscientious objection. \u0001is section has identi\u00aeed that there exists no nationally or internationally protected right to conscientiously object, and little defence of such an absolute right in either law or literature. 103 However, there remains considerable force to the argument that conscientious moral objection and civil disobedience is justi\u00aeed in certain circumstances. In the case of Katharine Gun, the particular moral characteristics of the situation, the complexity of her position, and the public outcry it sparked support the strong argument that her actions were justi\u00aeed. In situations of moral dilemma such as these, even if one does not believe that inaction is the morally wrong choice, one cannot morally condemn the choice to act; this is a characteristic of a moral dilemma. 104 Given that there is an argument in favour of the position that breaking some law is morally justi\u00aeable, then there remains an argument in favour of a legal defence of this nature. 4.3 Conscientious Objection and the Defence of Necessity If it were to be implemented, the legal recognition of conscientious moral objection rests on acknowledgement of the gravity of the individual's moral considerations in situations of m oral complexity. \u0001e practical purpose of such a recognition would be for the court to acknowledge the impact of these considerations on the culpability of the conscientious objector. Such a legal recognition would fall under the scope of a \u0091defence of necessity\u0092 and would remove the culpability of the conscientious objector against charges such as Gun's. Although the courts hold the general position that there is no criminal defence of necessity, as exempli\u00aeed in R v Dudley and Stephens , necessity has been acknowledged in piecemeal ways, in judgments and sentences. 105 Whilst it is unclear what speci\u00aecs Gun's legal team intended to argue, a 103 Raz, \u0002e Authority of Law (n 65) 281. 104 Lemmon (n 90). 105R v Dudley and Stephens [1884] EWHC 2 (QB), QBD 273. 151 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 defence of moral necessity in cases of non-violent conscientious disobedience would draw upon the court's piecemeal acknowledgement of the way in which moral necessity alters the culpability of the oVender. \u0001is would consequently demonstrate that it is unfair to treat the conscientious objector as equally culpable as the prima facie oVender, given the substantive moral considerations present in their decision to act unlawfully. Raz raises the following argument against the legal recognition of conscientious objection. He argues that the circumstances that lead to con\u00afict between the law and an individual's moral duty are normally subject to that individual's control. \u0001erefore, if that individual can prevent them, rather than disobey the law, then society is entitled to require the individual to shoulder the burden of their conviction, rather than require society itself to do so. 106 Yet this article proposes that this argument is oversimplistic and fails to acknowledge the nature of certain instances of conscientious objection, such as the complex moral dilemma in Katharine Gun's case. Conscientious moral objection, as Raz de\u00aenes it, is not merely the case of the agent breaking the law for moral reasons but also extends to the proposition that the agent was morally compelled to disobey because the law itself was wrong. 107 If the law or the act of obeying the law in that context is wrong, and personal morality compels them to protest against such wrongness, it is not a logical moral solution for those individuals to remove themselves from the circumstances of their objection. Moreover, in many cases of conscientious objection, it may be the act of remaining silent or refusing to act in opposition in the face of wrongdoing that the individual \u00aends morally impermissible. \u0001erefore, whilst this article does not support the conclusion that conscientious objection is an absolute right, because such a conclusion is incompatible with the nature of rights, as outlined in Section 3.2, it disagrees with Raz that there are not signi\u00aecant and compelling grounds in favour of legal protection of conscientious objectors \u0097 in the form of a defence of necessity. 106 Raz, \u0002e Authority of Law (n 65) 282. 107 Raz, \u0002e Authority of Law (n 65) 282. 152 York Law Review 5Conclusion \u0001e principal aim of this article was to re -examine the question of the duty to obey the law in cases of moral con\u00afict, through the contemporary lens of whistle-blowing. \u0001is article presents the view that, while there exists no absolute duty to obey the law, there is usually good reason to comply with the law. However, in the absence of good reason to comply and in the presence of a morally compelling reason for non-compliance, disobedience to law can be morally justi\u00aeed. \u0001is article proposes that the law should acknowledge that some moral considerations are su\u0003ciently substantial to justify breaking the law. It does not defend the concept of a moral \u0091right to disobey\u0092, nor believe this to be philosophically justi\u00aeable or practically enforceable. It does, however, take the view that, in cases such as Gun's, a \u0091defence of necessity\u0092 should be considered a valid legal defence. Moral considerations should be taken into account by the courts when assessing the culpability of the defendant and the wrongness of their conduct. \u0001e evidence and philosophy examined demonstrate that a blanket refusal of the law to consider moral objection or the human conscience as reasons for acting in cases of conscientious disobedience would be an unfair assessment of the culpability of the conscientious objector. Such a refusal would grossly oversimplify and undermine the complex link between legal and moral obligations. Dworkin's Gift to Constitutional Jurisprudence: Justifying the Moral Reading of the US Constitution Max Williams Abstract \u0001is article undertakes an analytical review of Ronald Dworkin 's \u0091moral reading of the American Constitution\u0092, which conceptualises a form of judicial review that unconventionally champions the compatibility of strong judicial review with the democratic principles underpinning the American Constitution. Moral readings are commonly rejected by commentators for subverting these democratic principles, by enabling the judiciary to depart from the text of the Constitution. However, this article argues that Dworkin's moral reading is necessarily respectful of the \u00aedelity that judges are expected to show towards the constitutional text. However, because the text is written in abstract terms, judges should actively embrace its ambiguity, as Dworkin suggested, rather than embrace the expectations of the Constitution's drafters for how the text would be applied. \u0001is is because the authors of the Constitution purposefully designed the text to be abstract in form. \u0001e a rticle discusses three primary variables inherent to Dworkin's account of the moral reading, namely democracy, textual interpretation, and accounting for the moral issues arising from constitutional, legal questions. \u0001ough central to Dworkin's thesis, each of the three variables is also utilised as a challenge to the integrity and comprehensibility of the moral reading by, respectively, Jeremy Waldron, Antonin Scalia, and Michael McConnell. According to these scholars, the existence of the three variables within Dworkin\u0092s account are inherently contradictory to Dworkin's attempt to ensure judicial restraint and to respect the wide scope of interpretation provided by the Constitution . \u0001is article refutes the existence of such a contradiction. 154 York Law Review 1Introduction Ronald Dworkin championed the compatibility of strong judicial review with the democratic principles underpinning the American Constitution. 1 His jurisprudence is de\u00aened by his \u0091moral reading of the Constitution\u0092, where judges decide cases by interpreting the abstract moral principles found within vague constitutional clauses. 2 Importantly, Dworkin did not advocate for judges departing from the Constitution's text, because he agreed that judges should show textual \u00aedelity to the intended instructions of the framers, that is, those who wrote the Constitution. 3 However, Dworkin recognised how the Constitution often spoke abstractly of unenumerated rights, referring vaguely to \u0091liberty\u0092 or \u0091equal protection\u0092. 4 Dworkin therefore claimed to provide a framework for judges to analyse the semantic intentions embedded within those abstract instructions \u0097 that is, for judges to infer the framers' intentions using the clearest connotative meaning of any ambiguous clauses. \u0001is would create a plethora of potential adjudicative outcomes, but without sacri\u00aecing textual \u00aedelity, which is vital given the judiciary is an unelected and nonrepresentative body. 5 Hence, Dworkin saw this exercise as democratically legitimate because judges did not have the scope to determine the Constitution's semantic content based on their own convictions. 6 1 For example, see Ronald Dworkin, Freedo m's Law: \u0002e Moral Reading of the American Constitution (Harvard UP 1996); Ronald Dworkin, \u0091\u0001e Arduous \u0002irtue of Fidelity: Originalism, Scalia, Tribe, and Nerve\u0092 (1997) 65 Fordham L Rev 129; and Ronald Dworkin, Justice in Robes (Harvard UP 2006). 2 See Dworkin, Freedom's Law (ibid) 3 for Dworkin's most detailed self-account of the moral reading. 3 ibid. 4 US Constitution Amend XI\u0002. 5 ibid. 6 ibid. 155 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 \u0001ere are three prominent criticisms of Dworkin 's moral reading. 7 First, some argue that strong judicial review is incompatible with democracy, because it provides judges with the capacity to rule on legislatively enacted law when they lack the necessary democratic credentials to do so. 8\u0001e s econd argument made against moral readings is that they contravene the common originalist theory that the Constitution's original meaning is only discernible with an historical account of how the framers interpreted it. 9 Since the Constitution is democratically adopted, the understanding of those who enacted it has supremacy over any other interpretation. 10 Treating the words used by the drafters of the Constitution as abstract rather than precise would encourage inferences that they might not have intended, inferences that would see judges abandon textual \u00aedelity and exceed their democratically restrained role. 11\u0001ird, some critics claim there is no sco pe for moral analyses in judicial review. 12 For example, a criticism of adjudication under the Fourteenth Amendment, which concerns equal protection under the law, is that judges are \u0091guided only by their personal views as to the fundamental rights\u0092 the Constitution protects. 13\u0001ough moral readings could garner more favourable results for minorities, where judges extend the scope of rights protection, they encourage judges to subvert democratic processes and exalt themselves \u0091at the expense of the people from whom they derive their [constitutional] authority\u0092 by encroaching upon the legislative role. 14 7 See, for example, Scott Hershovitz, Exploring Law's Empire: \u0002e Jurisprudence of Ronald Dworkin (OUP 2008). 8 For example, see James Madison, \u0091 \u0001e Federalist \u0092 in John Shapiro (ed), \u0002e Federalist Papers (Rethinking the Western Tradition) (Yale UP 2009). 9 J Harvie Wilkinson, \u0091Originalism\u0092 in J Harvie Wilkinson (ed), Cosmic Constitutional \u0002eory: Why Americans Are Losing \u0002eir Inalienable Rights to Self -Governance (OUP 2012) 34. 10 See Robert H Bork, \u0002e Tempting of America (Free Press 1990). 11 ibid. 12 Mitchell N Berman, \u0091Originalism Is Bunk\u0092 (2009) 84 NYU L Rev 1, 87. 13Obergefell v Hodges 576 US 644, 645\u009646 (2015) (\u0001omas J dissenting) (slip opinion). 14 ibid. 156 York Law Review Considering these propositions in turn, this article argues that Dworkin's moral reading is in fact an entirely appropriate approach to navigating concerns over the nature of democracy, the Constitution's text, and the inevitable role of moral judgments in contemporary appellate decision- making. \u0001e moral reading embraces the democratic principles necessary to properly protect the fundamental rights of minorities and the constitutional text's semantic properties, and to recognise that, when unenumerated rights are contested, the court faces an inevitable moral decision where the Bill of Rights does not address them. Accordingly, this article uses Fourteenth Amendment adjudication as an example that embodies these tensions, demonstrating how the moral reading is not only plausible but necessary. 15 \u0001e article is structured as follows. Section 2 analyses the premise of the moral reading, its adherence to democratic principles, and Dworkin's claim that it respects American constitutionalism with regard to the judiciary's limited role in the law-making process. Section 3 assesses the moral reading's compatibility with democracy, by comparing the moral reading as it exists in Dworkin's \u0091partnership\u0092 democracy with Jeremy Waldron's account of \u0091majoritarian\u0092 democracy, which embraces weak judicial review. 16 Waldron's account is the theoretical opposite to that of Dworkin's moral reading. Hence, it is the best account to use for comparison and to support this article's argument that the moral reading not only justi\u00aees strong judicial review, but that it is necessary in democratically protecting unenumerated rights. \u0001is article argues not only that the moral reading justi\u00aees strong judicial review but that it is necessary in democratically protecting unenumerated rights. Section 4 considers the moral reading's democratic requirement of textual \u00aedelity. Distinguishing \u0091semantic\u0092 from \u0091expectational\u0092 intentions, it argues that, when interpreting abstract written instructions, the semantic interpretation that Dworkin 15 H JeVerson Powell, \u0091 \u0001e Original Understanding of Original Intent \u0092 (1985) 98 Harv L Rev 885, 948. 16 Jeremy Waldron, \u0091 \u0001e Core of the Case against Judicial Review \u0092 (2006) 115 Yale LJ 1346. 157 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 favoured is in fact a more democratically legitimate exercise than determining how the framers would have interpreted the rules according to their archaic views. Section 5 analyses Michael McConnell's critique of the moral reading, which challenges its supposed normative inconsistency and theoretical incomprehensibility. 17 It argues that McConnell perpetuated some fundamental misconceptions about the moral reading, unfairly characterising it as democratically illegitimate and therefore oVensive to principles of judicial review. 2\u0001e Moral Reading Representative democracy has underpinned American law and politics since its founding. 18 Paine described the Constitution as \u0091populist-legal\u0092 \u0097 popular through the people's self-governance, and legal in binding the federal government. 19 Hence, the Constitution has democratic character because it was enacted by elected statesmen for the purpose of holding the federal government accountable to the people. 20 Accordingly, the judiciary, whose role it is to determine whether laws are made in accordance with the Constitution, is traditionally conceptualised as the \u0091least dangerous\u0092 branch of government. 21 It lacks the democratic credentials to legitimise any changes they make to the law because judges are unelected and have no representative mandate to do so (beyond judges being appointed by other o\u0003cials who are 17 Michael W McConnell, \u0091 \u0001e Importance of Humility in Judicial Review: A Comment on Ronald Dworkin's \u0093Moral Reading\u0094 of the Constitution\u0092 (1996) 65 Fordham L Rev 1269. 18For example, see \u0001omas Paine, Rights of Man (originally published 1791, \u0002irginia Tech 2001). 19 Robin West, \u0091Tom Paine's Constitution\u0092 (2003) 89 \u0002a L Rev 1413, 1433. 20 See Charles Warren, Congress, the Constitution and the Supreme Court (Johnson Reprint Corp 1968). 21 See Alexander M Bickel, \u0002e Least Dangerous Branch: \u0002e Supreme Court at the Bar of Politics (Yale UP 1986). 158 York Law Review elected). 22 Rather, as Alexander Hamilton suggested, the judiciary should be an \u0091intermediate body between the people and the legislature to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority\u0092. 23 Hence, there would be no scope for morality in constitutional adjudication because that would encourage judicial activism. 24 However, contemporary constitutional judgments demonstrate that the judiciary is not this \u0091least dangerous\u0092 institution. \u0001e judiciary has practised various forms of activism within the last century and demonstrated law-making power not envisioned by the framers. 25 For example, judicial adjudication has extended contemporary civil rights for women, African Americans, and parts of the LGBTQ community, pre-empting national legislative action on the policies at issue 26 \u0097 although adjudication may also serve to restrict the scope of rights. Furthermore, the much earlier Lochner 27 era of constitutional jurisprudence from 1897 to 1937 has been maligned because it is said to represent a period of judicial activism in opposition to regulations on labour conditions, consolidating its policy preference for economic freedoms. \u0001e judiciary developed a doctrine of substantive due process that routinely squashed popular mandates via an unconstitutionally self- exalted discretion to overrule majority determinations. 28 22 See Jamin B Raskin, Overruling Democracy: \u0002e Supreme Court versus the American People (Routledge 2004). 23 Madison (n 8) 513. 24 McConnell (n 17) 1273. 25 See Bruce E Cain and Nada Sabbah-Mourtada, \u0002e Political Question Doctrine and the Supreme Court of the United States (Lexington Books 2007). 26 See Brown v Board of Education of Topeka 347 US 483 (1954); Loving v Virginia 388 US 1 (1967); Obergefell v Hodges (n 13) and Lawrence et al v Texas , 539 US 558 (2003); Roe v Wade 410 US 113 (1973). 27Lochner v New York 198 US 45 (1905). 28 See, for example, Natalie Banta, \u0091 Substantive Due Process in Exile: \u0001e Supreme Court's Original Interpretation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\u0092 (2013) 13 Wy L Rev 151. 159 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 As a result, it is often argued that the judiciary has issued a challenge to democracy in its contemporary jurisprudence by diverging from the Constitution's text, resulting in what Bernard Schwartz has called a usurpation of power where judges are \u0091determining upon [their] own judgment whether particular legislation [is] desirable\u0092, and not the judgement of the people. 29 Whether these claims are accurate is not the subject of this article, but the debate continues due to concerns that the judiciary's willingness to utilise strong judicial review forecasts a likely trend towards extreme judicial minority rule. 2.1 Establishing the Moral Reading Dworkin posited a theory that accounts for the notions of judicial restraint and the inevitability that decisions will take a moral character. Dworkin never properly de\u00aened this moral reading but explained it by use of analogies. Regarding the Bill of Rights' ambiguity, he recognised how the Fourteenth Amendment refers to an \u0091equal\u0092 protection of all citizens. 30\u0001is provides a signi\u00aecant right but one which remains abstractly de\u00aened, and \u0091must be understood in the way [its] language most naturally suggests\u0092. 31 Because the language is purposefully abstract, it \u0091most naturally suggests\u0092 that judges should account for the Fourteenth Amendment\u0092s scope being unde\u00aened, so that its possible meaning is not limited to one narrow answer. \u0001e moral reading posits that ambiguous clauses \u0091refer to abstract moral principles\u0092 and judges should \u0091incorporate these by reference, as limits on [their] power\u0092. 32 29 See, for example, Branson D Dunlop, \u0091Fundamental or Fundamentally Flawed? A Critique of the Supreme Court's Approach to the Substantive Due Process Doctrine under the Fourteenth Amendment\u0092 (2014) 39 U Dayton L Rev 261; Jonathan F Mitchell, \u0091Textualism and the Fourteenth Amendment\u0092 (2017) 69 Stan L Rev 1237; Bernard Schwartz, \u0002e Supreme Court: Constitutional Revolution in Retrospect (Ronald Press 1957) 13\u0096 14; Richard G Stevens, \u0091Due Process of Law and Due Regard for the Constitution\u0092 (1985) Teaching Political Science 25. 30 Dworkin, Freedom's Law (n 1) 7; see also US Const itution Amend XI\u0002. 31 ibid. 32 ibid. 160 York Law Review \u0001ese abstract moral principles provide the limits on judicial interpretation, but, because the text does not disclose those limits, they are as wide in scope as the connotations of the clauses' objects. Approaching constitutional interpretation as a search for abstract moral principles is therefore a result of the text's linguistic nature. Take the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. It precludes the deprivation of \u0091any person of liberty without due process of the law\u0092. 33 But what does \u0091liberty\u0092 truly mean? What does \u0091due process\u0092 mean? \u0001e rule, its quali\u00aecations, and a complete understanding of the clause are seemingly left to judicial discretion within the con\u00aenes of the text's language . As such, a higher level of abstraction is required in accordance with the abstract instructions available to judges for determining the constitutional validity of legislation. Hence, principles like \u0091liberty\u0092 have been subject to expansive judicial review. \u0001e aforementioned Fourteenth Amendment r ights derive from abstract clauses \u0097 for Dworkin, this is no less legitimate than a ruling against a presidential candidate assuming o\u0003ce before the age of 35, which is explicitly required by Article II of the Constitution. 34\u0001ere is, of course, an inherent contrast between the two propositions as the democratic validity of the latter decision is di\u0003cult to question on textual grounds. 35 Nevertheless, Dworkin's view is sustainable because, just as the framers' explicit language in Article II demands narrow application, their ambiguous language in the Fourteenth Amendment inherently invites an abstract interpretation that, unlike Article II, is not restricted by explicitly narrow intentions. \u0001erefore, this is not an example of judicial activism but applied constitutional adjudication of particular language. 33 US Constitution Amend XI\u0002. 34 Dworkin, Freedom's Law (n 1) 8. 35 US Constitution Art II. 161 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 2.2 Limits on the Moral Reading Importantly, Dworkin had regard for democracy because he recognised two inherent restraints on the moral reading's application. First, \u0091constitutional interpretation must begin in what the framers said\u0092, with reference to speci\u00aec information about the context in which they gave their instructions. 36 Second, \u0091[j]udges may not read their own convictions into the Constitution\u0092, particularly any moral judgement that does not accord with identi\u00aeable abstract moral principles. 37 Hence, Dworkin insisted history is relevant \u0091in a particular way\u0092 because it helps explain what the framers intended to say with the abstract instructions they provided, but it also ensures judges are restrained by history, precedent, and the text, and are not misguided by their own convictions. 38 Accordingly, Dworkin recognised that \u0091the moral reading is not appropriate for everything the Constitution contains\u0092 ; it is derivative of how constitutional clauses were written and cannot be justi\u00aeed in all cases. 39 For instance, Article II would not require the moral reading because there is nothing textually contestable about the requirement that the president must be aged 35 or older when assuming o\u0003ce. 40\u0001e same cannot be said about the Fourteenth Amendment. \u0001is vital distinction, between clauses which are abstract and those which are clear and uncontested, usefully denotes where the moral reading is democratically legitimate \u0096 in addressing those clauses which were written purposefully abstractly. Hence, Dworkin provided a method of interpretation that respects and utilises the text's abstract linguistic qualities. 36 Dworkin, Freedom's Law (n 1) 7. 37 ibid. 38 ibid. 39 Dworkin, Freedom's Law (n 1) 8. 40 ibid. 162 York Law Review 3Democratic Legitimacy \u0001is section distinguishes two diVerent conceptions of democracy that in\u00afuence views on the moral reading's legitimacy as an example of strong judicial review. Jeremy Waldron subscribes to \u0091majoritarian\u0092 democracy and favours only weak judicial review, whereas Dworkin subscribed to \u0091partnership\u0092 democracy and favoured strong judicial review . \u0001is section argues that the moral reading justi\u00aees strong judicial review that protects unenumerated rights in a majoritarian democracy. To understand the basis of Dworkin and Waldron's divergence, strong and weak judicial review must \u00ae rst be distinguished. \u0001e relative strength or weakness of a nation's approach to judicial review relates to the authority of a court's ruling on legislatively enacted law \u0096 that is, whether the court has authority to overrule legislation. 41 In systems with strong judicial review, like America, a court's interpretation of the Constitution always stands except when reversing its own judgment, when changing its previous interpretations, or when the legislature amends the Constitution. 42 Comparatively, in systems with weak judicial review, the legislature can simply pass the law again irrespective of the court's interpretation of the Constitution directing otherwise. 43\u0001us, the distinction is that strong judicial review limits the legislature to amending the Constitution in line with the court's ruling .44 \u0001ere is nothing outside the scope of the court 's ruling with greater authority over the validity of law. \u0001e legislature 's only recourse is amending the court's source of contention.

Second, rather than assessing the propriety of the outcomes produced by democratic processes, Waldron prefers to assess the propriety of those processes. 49 Hence, if the process is improper, the outcome cannot be legitimate because whatever collective action follows cannot be authoritatively valid regardless of its content or eVects. Importantly, Waldron is not wholly unconcerned with morality. He argues that there should be a \u0091strong commitment [to] minority rights\u0092: an equality in democratic processes where minority views are expressed in democratic fora alongside the majority view, though he does not demand equality in how rights are ultimately decided. 50 \u0001erefore, Waldron 's limited vision of judicial power accords with weak judicial review. 51 45 See Stephen L Newman, Constitutional Politics in Canada and the United States (University of New York Press 2004). 46 Waldron (n 16) 1371. 47 Waldron (n 16) 1391\u009693. 48 Waldron (n 16). 49 Annabelle Lever, \u0091 Democracy and Judicial Review: Are \u0001ey Really Incompatible? \u0092 (2009) 7 Perspectives on Politics 805, 812\u009613. 50 Waldron (n 16) 1364. 51 See Robin West, \u0091Tom Paine's Constitution\u0092 (2003) 89 \u0002irginia Law Review 1413. 164 York Law Review 3.2 Dworkin's Democracy Dworkin agreed that the political equality of every person is necessary to legitimise collective action. 52 However, he distinguished himself from Waldron by characterising this process as \u0091the people acting together as members of a cooperative joint venture with equal standing \u0092. 53\u0001is was de\u00aened not only procedurally but substantively, with respect to how bene\u00aecial the outcome of the process proves to the whole community, not just the majority. 54 Dworkin therefore presupposed that democracy requires three conditions relating to political participation. First, \u0091all citizens must be given an opportunity to play an equal part in political life\u0092. 55\u0001is encompasses \u0091not only an equal franchise but an equal voice both in formal public deliberations and informal moral exchanges\u0092. 56 Waldron agrees with this. Second, citizens must have \u0091an equal stake in the government. It must be understood that everyone's interests are to be taken into account, in the same way, in determining where the collective action lies\u0092. 57\u0001is does not, by his own account, seem to contravene Waldron's premise because his \u0091majoritarian\u0092 democracy does account for equality in the democratic processes. He argues for a political commitment to minority rights. 58\u0001e problem is that, given his majoritarian position, Waldron's commitment to minority rights cannot su\u0003ciently arise if we accept Dworkin's third condition. \u0001at is, citizens must be provided with a \u0091private sphere\u0092 where they can make decisions on religion and ethics, answerable only 52 Dworkin, Freedom's Law (n 1) 17. 53 Ronald Dworkin, \u0091Equality, Democracy, and Constitution: We the People in Court\u0092 (1990) 28 Alta L Rev 324, 327 (emphasis added). 54 ibid. 55 Dworkin, Freedom's Law (n 1) 133. 56 Dworkin, Freedom's Law (n 1). 57 Dworkin, Freedom's Law (n 1) 134. 58 Waldron (n 16) 1364. 165 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 to themselves and not the conscience or judgement of a majority. 59 Dworkin argued that \u0091[n]o one can regard [themselves] as a full and equal member of an organised venture that claims authority to decide for [them] what [they] think self-respect requires [them] to decide for [themselves]\u0092. 60 \u0001is is a bold condition that departed from the status quo at the time of Dworkin's writing, and still does today . \u0001e First Amendment may guarantee religious freedom, and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments' due process clauses guarantee similarly ethical decisions of conscience and self-respect, but only the former can truly be said to have enjoyed unyielding constitutional security within the majoritarian arrangement. 61\u0001at there is a large volume of Fourteenth Amendment adjudication is itself evidence that the majoritarian conception of democracy has provided insu\u0003cient protection to the unenumerated rights that would exist within the private spheres that Dworkin described. Disagreement about the existence or nature of certain rights in the legislature has prevented the proper equal standing of minorities. \u0001is is because the decision on what self -respect entails relies on the result of constitutional procedure, not a speci\u00aeed mandate amongst those aVected parties designed to action their proclaimed constitutional rights. In other words, minorities have not been given the opportunity to rely on their constitutional rights by legal virtue, because the majoritarian nature of the legislature precludes this. \u0001at said, the \u0091private spheres\u0092 condition is sensible. Loper, for example, recognises that the Due Process Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment requires the government to protect equality even though 59 Dworkin, Justice in Robes (n 1) 133. 60 Dworkin, Justice in Robes (n 1). 61 US Constitution Amend I, \u0002 and XI\u0002; Sarah E Agudo and Steven G Calabresi, \u0091Individual Rights under State Constitutions when the Fourteenth Amendment Was Rati\u00aeed in 1868: What Rights Are Deeply Rooted in American History and Tradition?\u0092 (2008) 87 Tx L Rev 7. 166 York Law Review the text mentions only liberty. 62\u0001is is because applying laws \u0091equally serve[s] to cabin [the] infringement on liberty\u0092. 63 Hence, the constitutional values of liberty and equality are inherently linked by the dominant notion that, in part, meaningful liberty requires an equal access to particular institutions or services. 64 Moreover, to attain \u0091meaningful liberty\u0092 is to attain Dworkin's \u0091private spheres\u0092. \u0001at ensures equality in democracy and, therefore, law. \u0001ere is an interdependence between liberty and equality because it is the latter which 'prevents the law from making an improper or arbitrary distinction' between citizens on matters of unenumerated rights. 65 In other words, equality guarantees the liberty rights of all citizens because it ensures the law cannot discriminate without due process, and if that is so, it gives liberty its true meaning of living w ithout oppression. \u0001is interdependence thus indicates that, where minority rights are subjected to democratic discussion, the claim that equal standing can exist in a representative democracy is fallacious. Hence, Dworkin's \u0091partnership\u0092 democracy demands strong judicial review to ensure the equal standing of minorities in the democratic process. He quali\u00aeed the legitimacy of democratic processes further by protecting proper equality as de\u00aened by the \u0091private spheres\u0092 guaranteed to all citizens. 3.3 Waldron's Criticisms \u0001ough \u0091partnership\u0092 democracy might be appealing because of the equality it guarantees for minorities, Waldron remains steadfast as to 62 Timothy P Loper, \u0091Substantive Due Process and Discourse Ethics: Rethinking Fundamental Rights Analysis\u0092 (2006) 13 Wash & Lee J Civil Rights and Social Justice 41, 44. 63 Pamela S Karlan, \u0091 Some \u0001oughts on Autonomy and Equality in Relation to Justice Blackman\u0092 (1998) 26 Hastings Const LQ 59, 62. 64 ibid. 65 Kenneth Karst, 'Equality as a Central Principle in the First Amendment' (1975) 43 University of Chicago Law Review 20, 43-44. 167 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 the democratic illegitimacy of strong judicial review. Waldron's core criticisms are addressed subsequently, namely, that the moral reading is democratically illegitimate, and that legislatures protect rights better than courts do. 3.3.1 Democratic Legitimacy Waldron argues that strong judicial review is democratically illegitimate because there is no principled reason why judicial decision- making is better than that of legislators. 66\u0001inking pragmatically, he argues that appellate courts use the same majoritarian premise in reaching verdicts as legislators do \u0097 by counting heads in a popular vote. 67\u0001e deci sion still relies on the same majoritarian arrangement that Dworkin rejects as being incapable of ensuring minority equality. Waldron uses the United Kingdom as an a\u0003rmative example that legislative action is more appropriate for securing equality. He carefully selects examples including the legalisation of abortion and sexual relations between men \u0097 68 issues that have been resolved in America by the Supreme Court and not Congress \u0097 69 and argues that \u0091wide- ranging public deliberation was mirrored in serious debate in the House of Commons\u0092. 70 As such, the people could \u0091decide among themselves\u0092 the lawfulness of these matters through their representatives. While it is possible that Waldron's account of the UK experience might be accurate, the comparison with the US does not strengthen his argument, for two reasons. First, Dworkin's \u0091partnership\u0092 democracy, and the moral reading, is a re\u00afection of the abstract language of the US Constitution in particular. \u0001e moral reading is not a form of strong judicial rev iew applicable to 66 Waldron (n 16) 1390\u009691. 67 Waldron (n 16) 1390\u009699. 68 See, respectively, Abortion Act 1967; Sexual OVences Act 1967 (inter alia). 69 See, respectively, Roe v Wade (n 26); Lawrence v Texas 539 US 558 (2003). 70 Waldron (n 16) 1349. 168 York Law Review any system of law. \u0001e constitutional arrangement of the UK at the time of Waldron's examples was very diVerent to the US \u0097 the UK does not have a codi\u00aeed constitutional text akin to the US Constitution. As such, this comparison cannot substantiate Waldron's claims, because UK courts were not bound by a text enshrining citizens' rights. As such, their scope for judicial review was incomparable to that of courts in the US, where the Constitution binds action and provides unique grounds for adjudication not mirrored in the UK. Second, Waldron misunderstands Dworkin's proposition that representative democracy does not account for minority rights in its outcomes. 71 Waldron can easily champion the UK's legislative responses to the issues of abortion and sexual relations between men because they achieved results which might be regarded as \u0091desirable\u0092, in extending the protection aVorded to those rights at the time, without judicial interference. Yet he fails to recognise that these UK decisions took place several years or decades before their US counterparts, suggesting that, had it not been for judicial review, those rights might have continued to go unaddressed in legislative fora. Representative democracy might have continued to deprive minorities of proper equal standing in the democratic process, much less \u0091a private sphere within which they are free to make the most religious and ethical decisions for themselves\u0092. Waldron's comparison does not support his claim regarding the legitimacy of legislative supremacy, because it demonstrates that the US has needed judicial review to resolve similar issues in the absence of legislative treatment. \u0001is supports Dworkin 's argument for strong judicial review within the framework of \u0091partnership\u0092 democracy. Waldron would need to retreat from his positive appraisal of the UK to justify the lack of federal abortion laws or the permissibility of sexual relations between men without judicial review in the US. However, this would require him to admit that his pragmatism fails to account for a potential lack of practical change in rights protection as a consequence. 71 Dworkin, Freedom's Law (n 1) 17. 169 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 3.3.2 Legislative Protection Waldron's second criticism is that rights are better protected by legislatures than by courts because courts are comparatively unconcerned with precise moral issues. Rather, \u0091judicial reasoning is dictated by arcane legal issues which are secondary to the moral issues at hand\u0092. 72 In practice, though, there is little to vindicate this majoritarian claim upon an examination of constitutional history. First, Waldron's claim is ignorant of the reality that some civil rights movements in the US have traditionally sought to make progress via legislative governmental branches, that is, democratic fora, but the lack of progress has encouraged a turn to the courts. 73 Hence, because the democratic process has proven ineVective in expanding rights protection in certain areas, some civil rights movements have required use of the courts to make progress in rights protection. Waldron's aforementioned criticism of the US courts' constitutional review of abortion and sex between men therefore mischaracterises that process of review as an unconstitutional act of an unelected body. He fails to acknowledge that without those decisions, the equal rights' doctrines which have since been developed may not have been realised, revealing an irony in his position as a result. 74 Waldron claims there is a commitment to rights on the basis of \u0091majoritarian\u0092 democracy, but that commitment is only a procedural one. It might be that by some objective measure the proponents of unenumerated rights were given equal platforms to express their views during these democratic processes. However, committing to hearing minority views is not equivalent to committing to protecting those rights. \u0001e former is eVectively futile if the latter cannot be guaranteed 72 Waldron (n 16) 1379\u009680. 73 See Emily Zackin, \u0091Popular Constitutionalism's Hard When You're Not \u0002ery Popular: Why the ACLU Turned to Courts\u0092 (2008) 42 Law & Society Review 367. 74See, for example, Civil Rights Act 1964; Lawrence v Texas (n 69 ); United States v Windsor 570 US 744 (2013); Obergefell v Hodges (n 13). 170 York Law Review because the very purpose of ensuring a procedurally equal platform for minority views is to ensure their rights are adequately protected. \u0001is tension highligh ts that, where Waldron claims that the majoritarian position protects unenumerated rights for minorities, this creates a constitutional imbalance in his account. \u0001is is because, in practice, representative democracy does not promise to protect rights. It merely promises to listen to why they should be protected, but it may reject them nevertheless . \u0001ough Waldron could argue that characterising his position in this way unduly imparts morals into an otherwise pragmatic arrangement, rights are inherently of moral concern. In that respect, the scope that \u0091partnership\u0092 democracy provides judges to engage in the moral reading ensures the democratic process is not used to subjugate the rights of those minorities to a mere headcount. It avoids the empty promise of representational deliberation, because the equal standing which minorities are guaranteed already encompasses the matters of conscience and self-respect that they desire within their \u0091private sphere\u0092. 75 Second, it is an unfair claim that courts unduly adjudicate disagreements about rights without regard to the precise moral issue. Comparatively speaking, legislative deliberation should have as much regard for the lawful parameters of the Constitution as is claimed of adjudication, because failure to do so triggers the very constitutional adjudication which addresses whether a law is unconstitutional. \u0001us, judicial review is a safeguarding by-product of the system's recognition that failure to comply with the Constitution requires a determination of a law's constitutional character and authority. Moreover, many argue that constitutional adjudication is abundant with morally self- characterised judgments \u0096 indeed, a common criticism of judicial review is that judges are too often swayed by their own moral convictions and not enough by the Constitution's text. 76 Waldron 75 Dworkin, Justice in Robes (n 1) 133. 76 See, for example, Michael J Perry, We the People: \u0002e Fourteenth Amendment and the Supreme Court (OUP 1999). 171 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 himself says as much when criticising strong judicial review on the basis that judges should not have the power to change or create law, a power that, if used, is in\u00afuenced by whatever convictions they have regarding the existing state of the law as it applies to an instant case. 77 So, while Waldron argues that courts are not su\u0003ciently concerned with the moral issues at stake, when judges do show concern for morals, this is used as justi\u00aecation to reject the strong judicial review that they must undertake to properly commit to protecting those morals. \u0001ese two propositions are inherently contradictory, and so cannot coexist. \u0001is emphasises further the neglect that Waldron's account of democracy pays towards the protection of minorities. Nevertheless, the moral reading oVers what is needed to strike the balance required by Waldron's contradictory concerns. It allows judges the scope to properly consider the constitutional protection aVorded to unenumerated rights, but with an expectation that judges demonstrate textual \u00aedelity. So, under Dworkin's moral reading, courts have the authoritative power to announce rights not explicitly referred to by the text, but not to the extent that judges are left to their own moral convictions. In summary, the dominant notion that mere head-counting su\u0003ces to determine the validity of minority rights endangers the protection of those rights. By conceiving democracy as an equal joint venture, the moral reading ensures minorities do not become subject to a majority's rule on the matters of conscience and self-respect that the Fourteenth Amendment already prescribes, justifying strong judicial review within the US context. 4Textual Fidelity Whether the Fourteenth Amendment can truly be conceived as prescribing the equal protection of rights in practice is essential to 77 Waldron (n 16). 172 York Law Review justifying Dworkin's theoretical proposition. Hence, this section elaborates on the judicial interpretation that Dworkin envisioned for the moral reading, namely that judges can demonstrate textual \u00aedelity by performing an analysis of the text's semantic meaning, rather than identifying the framers' speci\u00aec expectations. 4.1 Originalism Broadly, originalism is a form of constitutional interpretation reliant upon the framers' original intentions, prioritising the people's mandate that the framers relied upon during the drafting. 78 As such, originalism adheres to the Constitution's democratic character. 79 According to originalist doctrine, since moral interpretations may elicit a wide scope of possible outcomes not envisioned by the framers, moral readings subvert the democratic legitimacy of whatever decision the court reaches. Indeed, while broadly opposed to originalism, Justice Reinhardt recognised that grounding constitutional interpretation in the framers' original intentions provides \u0091a concrete foundation for analysis\u0092. 80 Scalia J concurred, arguing that without this principled reasoning, \u0091the answers to many constitutional questions would be open to debate\u0092. 81 Hence, because judicial discretion would subvert the \u00aedelity which judges should show to the framers, discretion is illegitimate. 82 78Wilkinson (n 9); see also Cass R Sunstein, \u0091Black on \u0093Brown\u0094\u0092 (2004) 90 \u0002a L Rev 1649. 79 See, for example, Lawrence B Solum, \u0091Originalism and Constitutional Construction\u0092 (2013) 82 Fordham L Rev 453. 80 See Compassion in Dying v Washington 79 F 3d 70 (9 th Cir 1996) (en banc). 81 Antonin Scalia, \u0091Originalism: the Lesser Evil\u0092 (1989) 57 U Cin L Rev 849, 854. 82 ibid 863. 173 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 4.2 Distinguishing Semantics from Expectations Dworkin distinguished \u0091semantic\u0092 from \u0091expectation\u0092 originalism. 83 \u0001e former \u0091takes what the legislators collectively meant to say as decisive of constitutional meaning \u0092; the latter \u0091makes decisive what [the legislators] expected to accomplish in saying what they did\u0092. 84\u0001e distinction is thus one of interpretive process. Semantic originalism considers the text's linguistic construction as a manifestation of how speci\u00aec the framers intended to be with their instructions. Expectational originalism considers how the framers themselves would have applied the text with respect to their own society's attitudes. 85 Perry's analogy highlights this distinction. 86 He gives the example of a US university's decision to make \u0091philosophical talent\u0092 the primary consideration in the department's hiring policy, presupposing that a majority of those who voted for this resolution assumed that \u0091philosophical talent\u0092 consisted of skilfulness and sophistication. 87 According to semantic originalism, future members who \u0091become more skeptical\u0092 of skilfulness and sophistication are justi\u00aeed in implementing their own views about \u0091philosophical talent\u0092 because they are showing \u00aedelity to that phrase as it is, unde\u00aened. 88 By contrast, expectation originalism presupposes that the resolution is de\u00aened only by the enactors' particular conception of \u0091philosophical talent\u0092. 89 For future members to apply their own views on \u0091philosophical talent\u0092 would thus be considered illegitimate. Arguably, this latter interpretation contradicts the hiring policy. Dworkin recognised that, where the 83 Dworkin, Justice in Robes (n 1) 120. 84 Dworkin, Justice in Robes (n 1). 85 Andrei Marmor, \u0091Meaning and Belief in Constitutional Interpretation\u0092 (2013) 82 Fordham L Rev 577, 578. 86 John Perry, \u0091Textualism and the Discovery of Rights\u0092 in Andrei Marmor and Scott Soames (eds), Philosophical Foundations of Language in the Law (OUP 2011) 105\u0096 06. 87 ibid. 88 ibid. 89 ibid. 174 York Law Review instruction prescribes an abstract standard, readers must decide what that standard means, which, as Dworkin caveated, is \u0091a diVerent question to what some person thinks meets that standard\u0092. 90 Accordingly, the hiring policy's framers did not clarify the meaning of \u0091philosophical talent\u0092, providing the scope for future members to decide for themselves. \u0001e original members cannot question the \u00aedelity of those future members to this policy given they failed to explicate how they themselves would have interpreted the policy. Likewise, the Fourteenth Amendment's abstract instructions semantically provide scope for judges to determine what \u0091liberty\u0092 encompasses, since the framers failed to explicate their own interpretation. \u0001erefore, the text does not restrain judges from \u00aending that, for example, the right to marry extends to same-sex couples, despite the likelihood that the framers would have disapproved of this in 1868. 91\u0001erefore, semantic originalism accords with the abstract nature of the instructions provided, given the framers' expectations are irrelevant to the Constitution's text. As Dworkin said, they were \u0091careful states[people] who knew how to use the language they spoke\u0092 ; \u0091 they used abstract language because they intended to state abstract principles\u0092. 92\u0001us, if judges are expected to demonstrate textual \u00aedelity, they should not be \u0091con\u00aened to a process of discovering\u0092 the framers' speci\u00aec intentions, because that process would go beyond the text. 93 Yet, the dissenting justices in Obergefell v Hodges , a landmark US Supreme Court case which held that the fundamental right to marry is guaranteed to same-sex couples by the Fourteenth Amendment, did just that.94\u0001ey concluded the right to marry does not extend to same-sex 90 Dworkin, Justice in Robes (n 1) 125. 91 Robert A Destro, \u0091\u0093You Have the Right to Remain Silent:\u0094 Does the US Constitution Require Public A\u0003rmation of Same-Sex Marriage?\u0092 (2013) 27 BUJPL 397. 92 Dworkin, Justice in Robes (n 1) 122. 93 Terrance Sandalow, \u0091Constitutional Interpretation\u0092 (1981) 79 Mich L Rev 1033, 1035. 94Obergefell v Hodges (n 13). 175 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 couples because the framers would not have accepted such a de\u00aenition of marriage. Such expectational originalism denies the logistical and democratic plausibility of any moral reading. Yet, semantic originalism, a core feature of the moral reading, seemingly accords with the Constitution's abstract instructions better than making inferences based on knowledge of unwritten, and therefore non-binding, expectations. \u0001e forthcoming discussion assesses why the moral reading accords with democracy and textual \u00aedelity, highlighting the hypocrisy embedded within the expectational originalist position in the process. 4.3 Dworkin's Fidelity Scalia's own account enables us to easily identify that Dworkin's moral reading does in fact demonstrate textual \u00aedelity. Scalia rejected Dworkin's moral reading and presented his argument by considering two other commentators \u0097 Laurence Tribe and Paul Brest \u0097 who he claimed likewise reject the Constitution's original meaning. 95 However, Dworkin was both theoretically and pragmatically distinguishable from these commentators. First, Scalia claimed that Tribe \u0091does not believe that the originally understood content of [constitutional] provisions has much to do with how they are to be applied today\u0092. 96 Rather, the Constitution \u0091invites us to expand on the freedoms that are uniquely our heritage\u0092 and \u0091invites a collaborative inquiry, involving both the Court and the country, into the contemporary content of freedom, fairness, and fraternity\u0092. 97 Dworkin himself mentioned that Tribe seemingly disregards textual \u00aedelity, particularly since Tribe scolds Dworkin's moral reading for retrieving \u0091empirical facts about what a \u00aenite set of 95 Scalia (n 81) 853. 96 Laurence H Tribe, God Save \u0002is H onorable Court: How the Choice of Justices Shape Our History (Random House 1985) 45. 97 Laurence H Tribe, American Constitutional Law (2nd edn, Foundations 1988) 771. 176 York Law Review actors at particular moments in our past meant to be saying\u0092. 98 Dworkin, though, contended he had never held such a strict view on the framers' speci\u00aec intentions. 99 \u0001ough Tribe encourages a cooperative venture between the courts and the people to develop the text's meaning in accordance with changing social attitudes, this process is democratically improper. \u0001e court is not conceived as a law-making body. It lacks the legislature's representational structure to properly determine a popular mandate, a structure that can be used to justify any developments made in the name of social attitudes. Moreover, this was not Dworkin's position. \u0001eir arguments diverge on the reliance on the framers' intentions, but Tribe fails to understand that Dworkin's textual \u00aedelity relies on seeking semantic intentions. Tribe is not necessarily wrong to criticise expectational originalism for the above reasons. But he wrongly characterises Dworkin as subscribing to the same notions, while at the same time purporting an alternative theory of adjudication that subverts the proper democratic process. Dworkin's moral reading demonstrates textual \u00aedelity to abstract instructions, but Tribe intends to ignore those instructions altogether. Second, Scalia mentioned how Brest openly \u0091abandoned consent and \u00aedelity to the text and original understanding\u0092 because, Brest says, \u0091the practice of constitutional decision-making should enforce [only those] values that are fundamental to our society\u0092. 100 Moreover, any notions that the text and original understanding inform the determination of those values ignores that the subsequent conclusions are \u0091defeasible at best in the light of changing values\u0092. 101 Hence, not only is morality the touchstone of Brest's account of judicial review, but he contends that 98 Dworkin, Justice in Robes (n 1) 127; Laurence H Tribe, \u0091Comment\u0092 in Amy Gutmann and Antonin Scalia (eds), A Matter of Interpretation: Federal Courts and the Law (Princeton UP 2018) 75. 99 Dworkin, Justice in Robes (n 1) 127. 100 Paul Brest, \u0091 \u0001e Misconceived Quest for the Original Understanding \u0092 (1980) 60 BUL Rev 204, 226. 101 ibid. 177 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 judicial review should recognise these contemporary changes in morality when interpreting the text. Dworkin did embrace Brest's moral endeavours. Being concerned with abstract moral principles, the scope of Dworkin's approach is suYciently wide to account for society's changing morality, since the Fourteenth Amendment lacks textual quali\u00aecations to the rights it contains. However, they diverge pragmatically because Dworkin not only expected textual \u00aedelity but predicted that the kinds of results Brest desires are capable of being found in the text if we employ semantic originalism. 102 Because the Fourteenth Amendment's instructions are abstract, \u0091liberty\u0092 can be interpreted widely to include the many things \u0091liberty\u0092 typically connotes, including an array of equal and civil rights re\u00afecting the freedom of choice. Hence, there are no textual quali\u00aecations preventing the courts from considering society's changing morality. \u0001is is particularly apparent if judicial review is also characterised as ful\u00aelling the requirements of a \u0091partnership\u0092 democracy \u0097 however fundamental rights arise over time to re\u00afect changing social attitudes, it would be within the judiciary's capacity to facilitate those rights' protections. It might not be enough for expectational originalists to show Dworkin's moral reading can be distinguished from other claims regarding textual \u00aedelity, since Dworkin still relied on morality. No matter the semantic evidence of abstract moral principles within the Constitution, the text oVers such loose ideas of what \u0091liberty\u0092 encompasses that judges could theoretically hinge any moral claim on \u0091liberty\u0092 in the name of textual \u00aedelity. \u0001is next section defends this by comparison to the lack of textual \u00aedelity displayed in the pursuit of traditional values by expectational originalists. 102 Dworkin, Justice in Robes (n 1) 120. 178 York Law Review 4.4 Arbitrary Tradition 4.4.1 Scalia's Rule of Law Scalia explicated a rule of law that he believed would \u0091guard against the arbitrary exercise of judicial power\u0092, and framed the moral reading as such an arbitrary exercise. He suggested that, because general constitutional notions of morality \u0091provide such imprecise guidance\u0092, it is necessary to \u0091adopt the most speci\u00aec tradition as the point of reference\u0092, to avoid judges dictating rather than discerning society's views. 103 So, taking the constitutionality of same-sex marriage, the tradition in question is that of same-sex marriage rather than marriage generally, because the speci\u00aec issue was the legality of marrying same- sex unions. 104 Taking the opposite interpretation to the moral reading, Scalia embraced expectational originalism because historical inquiry informs contemporary adjudication of the framers' likely views at the time of enactment with regard to the instant issue. Scalia's method fails because it is, ironically, itself an arbitrary limitation on decision-making. 105 By selecting the most speci\u00aec relevant tradition, Scalia became \u0091conceptually at odds\u0092 with the Fourteenth Amendment's purpose to protect minority interests from majority oppression. 106 He subjected minority interests to \u0091the conventional morality of the majority\u0092, claiming that this appropriately de\u00aenes tradition. 107 Consequently, Scalia's argument demonstrates a lack of attention to judicial restraint by unduly narrowing the Fourteenth Amendment's 103Michael H v Gerald D 491 US 110 (1998). 104Obergefell v Hodges (n 13) 644 ( \u0001omas J, dissenting). 105 Edward G Spitko, \u0091A Critique of Justice Antonin Scalia's Approach [1990] Duke LJ 1337, 1353. 106ibid 1353; see, for example, Judith A Baer, Equality under the Constitution: Reclaiming the Fourteenth Amendment (Cornell UP 2018). 107 Spitko (n 105) 1353. 179 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 protection of fundamental rights without any textual justi\u00aecation. 108 \u0001ere are therefore concerns that Scalia's account is activist because he not only mischaracterised the wide scope of the Fourteenth Amendment's abstract instructions but did so to imply into the text restrictions that do not exist. His activist rejection of the framers' written instructions ironically succumbs to the judicial divergence he claims is inherent in the moral reading. 4.4.2 De\u00aening Tradition \u0001is issue is exacerbated by the indeterminate de\u00aenition of tradition. Graglia, for example, claims judges \u0091consistently aim to overthrow and undermine traditional values\u0092, but he does not explain where and when we de\u00aene these traditions. 109\u0001e de\u00aenition of \u0091tradition\u0092 may generally have broad connotations, but, like \u0091liberty\u0092, no de\u00aenition is provided. \u0001e diVerence is that, unlike \u0091liberty\u0092, \u0091tradition\u0092 cannot be found in the Constitution's text. Consequently, \u0091tradition\u0092 is merely an \u0091illusory limitation\u0092 because judges are unrestricted in deciding for themselves what quali\u00aees as a tradition. 110\u0001us, there is no basis for the claim that using \u0091tradition\u0092 as a barometer for constitutional interpretation is democratically legitimate, because the expectational originalists' de\u00aenitions of \u0091tradition\u0092 have changed from case to case, demonstrating a lack of judicial restraint. For example, how is it that expectational originalists in Loving v Virginia accepted the decision to legalise interracial marriage when the same theoretical position was used to resist aYrmation of same-sex 108 Spitko (n 105). 109 Lino A \u0091 Constitutional Law Without the Constitution: \u0001e Supreme Court' s Remaking of America\u0092 in Robert Bork (ed), A Country I Do Not Recognise (Hoover Institution Press 2005) 1; \u00e8ukasz Machaj, \u0091Is the United States Supreme Court an Undemocratic Institution? An Outsider's Perspective\u0092 (2011) 1 Wroclaw Review of Law, Administration and Economics 13, 15. 110 Spitko (n 105) 1339. 180 York Law Review marriage in Obergefell ?111\u0001e distinction was made that, in Loving , the judges were not changing the traditional understanding of marriage being a union of one woman and man, unlike in Obergefell .112 \u0002et, traditionally understood, individuals of African descent were considered by the Supreme Court the property of white US citizens until at least the Civil War. 113 So, interracial marriage cannot possibly have roots in US tradition and should be as unjusti\u00aeable according to US tradition as same-sex marriage. How, then, can expectational originalists justify this discretionary application of tradition? Not only did the courts show discretion between the two cases as to the level of generality with which they would de\u00aene tradition, but they showed discretion in Loving to only consider the speci\u00aec issue of marriage as an internationally recognised union. \u0001i s surely compromises their faithfulness to the framers' expectations in ignoring the totality of the context, namely that, while marriage would have been de\u00aened as a union between opposite-sex couples, it would likely also have been limited to couples of the same ethnicity. \u0001is section has rebutted the dominant notion that expectational originalism prevents judicial discretion, and that seeking the traditional understanding of contemporary issues best serves democracy. \u0001e moral reading and semantic originalism account for the abstract nature of the Constitution, recognising that broad, unde\u00aened instructions must have been intentionally devised to provide discretionary scope, which remains restrained only by the words provided. Accordingly, inferring the requirement of \u0091traditional\u0092 justi\u00aecation from these abstract instructions unduly narrows their broad connotations, ironically demonstrating the activism that originalists fear the moral reading will allow. 111Loving v Virginia (n 26). 112Loving v Virginia (n 26) 16 (Roberts CJ dissenting). 113Dred Scott v Sandford 60 US 393 \u0097 5\u0091\u0001e Two Dworkins \u0092 Michael McConnell attacks Dworkin's moral reading for advocating contradictory notions of textual \u00aedelity and democracy. He refers to these positions as the \u0091Dworkin of Fit\u0092 and the \u0091Dworkin of Right Answers\u0092. 114 \u0002et it is argued here that McConnell fundamentally misunderstands several important elements of Dworkin's moral reading, rendering his criticisms of inconsistency and illegitimacy moot. 5.1 Introducing the Two Dworkins McConnell says the Dworkin of Fit believes judges are \u0091seriously constrained by what has come before by text, history, tradition and precedent, and should exercise their moral-philosophical faculties only within the limits set by history\u0092. 115 Conversely, the Dworkin of Right Answers argues the Constitution's text \u0091must be interpreted at a suYciently abstract level that they do not interfere with the judge's ability\u0092 to make the Constitution \u0091the best it can be\u0092. 116 McConnell therefore surmises that the moral reading is theoretically irreconcilable, arguing that \u0091the Dworkin of Fit [would] attack the Dworkin of Right Answers for the latter's lack of respect for the distinctive qualities of judging within the US tradition\u0092. 117 Equally, he expects \u0091the Dworkin of Right Answers to charge the Dworkin of Fit with sacri\u00aecing \u0093principle\u0094 to \u0093history\u0094\u0092. 118 McConnell seemingly concedes, however, that \u0091the two [Dworkins] work together harmoniously at a practical level\u0092 if we distinguish the kinds of cases that each would adjudicate. 119 \u0091\u0001e Dworkin of Right Answers decides all important contested cases \u0092, whereas \u0091the Dworkin of Fit defends against charges of judicial 114 McConnell (n 17) 1270. 115 McConnell (n 17) 1270. 116 Ronald Dworkin, Law's Empire (Belknap Press 1986) 62. 117 ibid. 118 ibid. 119 ibid. 182 York Law Review imperialism\u0092, by accounting for the problem of \u0091judicial overreaching\u0092 and acknowledging that judges do not decide cases on a blank slate but rather in accordance with the constitutional text and history. 120 McConnell concludes that Dworkin cannot be said to appropriately mediate the tensions over the nature of democracy, the Constitution's text, and the role of moral judgments in appellate decision-making because the two Dworkins subscribe to contradictory views on judicial review. \u0002et this conclusion is misguided because the alleged \u0091contradictions\u0092 form part of a cohesive framework that McConnell has overlooked. 5.2 Fidelity with a Moral Reading McConnell surmises that the Dworkin of Fit cannot possibly engage with the commitments that Dworkin argued are embedded in the text, because \u0091many provisions of the Constitution are written in broad and abstract language\u0092. 121 In other words, McConnell presupposes that Dworkin wa s concerned with expectations. \u0001is is false \u0097 Dworkin emphasised the importance of distinguishing between expectations and semantics for understanding how judges can remain committed to the text via the moral reading even when the text is abstract, as discussed above in Section 4. McConnell does not acknowledge this distinction, and subsequently argues that in relation to \u0091directive or prohibitory language\u0092, like that of the Fourteenth Amendment, \u0091what the authors intended to say is precisely what they intend to require, authorise, or prohibit\u0092. 122 In other words, if the authors hypothetically intended to limit the remit of marriage to opposite-sex couples in a constitutional amendment relating to marriage in some way, they intended to preclude same-sex marriage in consequence and for as long as the Constitution remaine d valid. \u0001is 120 ibid. 121 McConnell (n 17) 1271. 122 McConnell (n 17) 1280. 183 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 seemingly con\u00afates semantics with expectations because McConnell suggests that the semantic clarity of the Constitution is determined by the framers' identi\u00aeable expectations. \u0001e scope of the Constitution 's semantic properties, he contends, is not determined by the plethora of dictionary de\u00aenitions we can attribute to the words used, but dictated by \u0091the broader context of [the framers'] purpose and political theory\u0092. 123 McConnell raises the example of the Ex Post Facto Clauses of Article I of the Constitution, which prohibit Congress and the state legislatures from retroactively criminalising conduct. 124 He says that, while the language could be interpreted to preclude all legislation, \u0091[w]e know from Madison's notes of the Convention that the framers understood this term to be limited to retroactive criminal laws\u0092. 125\u0001erefore, Dworkin's commitment to semantic intentions is \u0091compromised\u0092, because a moral reading of the text could not deduce this particular focus that the framers had in mind. 126 Hence, semantic originalism reduces the legitimacy of judicial review because it is not capable of discerning these historical facts. \u0001is, however, is \u00afawed logic. First, why does McConnell seek the clari\u00aecation of vague constitutional clauses in extra-legal sources that have no binding force? Moreover, what makes this process diVerent, and constitutionally more appropriate, to inferring abstract moral principles? Ultimately, why did the framers choose not to include all of the information they deemed relevant to properly understanding their intentions? How can contemporary judges be expected to understand that they intended for the Ex Post Facto Clauses to only refer to criminal legislation? It is illogical for abstract instructions to have been provided with particular intentions when the framers had the power and 123 ibid. 124 US Constitution Art I. 125 See Jonathan Elliot, \u0002e Debates in Several State Conventions of the Adoption of the Federal Constitution (originally published 1827, HardPress Publishing 2019); McConnell (n 17) 1280. 126 McConnell (n 17). 184 York Law Review competency to make them more precise \u0097 that is, unless the framers intended only to provide abstract instructions. Hence, McConnell is incorrect when he claims that Dworkin \u0091tries to have it both ways\u0092 in liberating judges \u0091to achieve their own vision of the best answers to controversial questions without regard to the framers' opinions\u0092 (the Dworkin of Right Answers) while also \u0091claiming to be faithfully carrying out the framers' intentions\u0092 (the Dworkin of Fit). It is widely accepted that the text is imprecise. 127\u0001e framers deliberately omitted some information that could have clari\u00aeed their intentions, and that information is inconsequential for judges interpreting the text today because their duty is only to the text. McConnell cannot justi\u00aeably criticise the imbalance of the moral reading when the instructions are abstract. By way of analogy, it is akin to asking your neighbour, who is new to the area, to drive you to your desired loca tion. \u0001e only direction you provide is that you want to go \u0091over there\u0092 while pointing in a general direction. When they cannot \u00aend that location, you scold them for not following your directions properly. \u0002et it is not your neighbour's fault because the instructions provided were too imprecise to satisfy your speci\u00aec intentions. \u0001is displays the issues with McConnell 's overly strict expectations of judicial interpretation. Judges are provided a limited quality of direction. \u0002et, McConnell nevertheless believes that the moral reading does not adequately curb judicial discretion, despite Dworkin's insistence that we should take the framers' abstract instructions as evidence that they knew they were providing the scope for judges to arrive at diVerent \u0091destinations\u0092. 128\u0001is is not a compelling basis on which to discredit the moral reading, least of all because the source of McConnell's contention is the Constitution itself and not the moral reading. Hence, there is no textual dichotomy separating the two 127 See Katharine T Bartlett, \u0091Tradition as Past and Present in Substantive Due Process Analysis\u0092 (2012) 62 Duke LJ 535; Craig Haney, \u0091\u0001e Fourteenth Amendment and Symbolic Legality: Let \u0001em Eat Due Process \u0092 (1991) 15 Law and Human Behaviour 183; Spitko (n 1 05). 128 Dworkin, Freedom's Law (n 1) 9. 185 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 Dworkins. Abstract interpretation (which the Dworkin of Right Answers prefers) is inevitable even with strict textual \u00aedelity (that the Dworkin of Fit prefers) because the framers did not provide anything more speci\u00aec for judges to apply. 5.3 Circle Stories McConnell criticises Dworkin's \u0091chain novel\u0092 analogy by oVering his own analogy. Dworkin argued that the relationship between the branches of federal government on constitutional matters re\u00afects a situation where chapters of a book are written subsequently but by diVerent authors. 129 McConnell agrees with this concept, but argues that the situation in practice more resembles a childlike game of circle stories, that is, where one party to the game begins a narrative, and each other party takes turns to continue the narrative as they see \u00aet. 130 Indeed, one branch writes the \u00aerst chapter, another the second, and so on. 131 However, he questions why Dworkin assigned the courts the role of author given their analogous existence is more akin to an editor or \u0091referee\u0092, not a writer. 132 Particularly, he argues that their presumptive role as writer (or lawmaker) and editor (or a branch of government reviewing the laws written by another branch) provides the courts with the scope to decide on their own not just whether the other branches have devised new laws in accordance with proper procedure and constitutional integrity, but to decide what the law should be. 133\u0001ey would be embracing the Dworkin of Right Answers. \u0001is criticism is rooted in traditional constitutional theory, where courts ought to adjudicate over the constitutional practice of other branches of government but not create law. 134 Hence, the moral reading would be 129 Dworkin, Freedom's Law (n 1). 130 McConnell (n 17) 1275. 131 Dworkin, Freedom's Law (n 1) 9. 132 McConnell (n 17) 1275. 133 McConnell (n 17). 134 Madison (n 8) 513. 186 York Law Review \u0091anti-democratic\u0092 because the dual role of writer and editor would invert the primacy of popular self-governance respected by the Dworkin of Fit. 135 However, that is not necessarily the case. As Rousseau argues, constitutional judges should be considered an \u0091indispensable corollary\u0092 of a true constitutional democracy because their anti-majoritarian neutrality presupposes a politically agenda-less interpretation and protection of constitutional values. 136 Importantly, being anti-majoritarian is not the same as being anti- democratic. \u0001e role of constitutional judges is to ensure that laws are enacted in accordance with those values. Otherwise, the Constitution becomes a powerless enactment if there is no governmental body that can safeguard the promises it expounds. 137 One signi\u00aecant reason that this becomes confused in discourse on US constitutionalism is that the Constitution itself is not suYciently clear as to satisfy the entire population that judges' interpretative work is a legitimate form of judicial review, rather than an example of judicial activism. Nevertheless, that their decision-making may result in amending or overruling legislatively enacted laws does not necessarily exemplify the proposed \u0091tyranny of the minority\u0092 about which McConnell is concerned. 138 In fact, McConnell's own \u0091referee\u0092 analogy supports Dworkin's notion that the semantic plurality of the Constitution's abstract instructions justi\u00aees the quasi-law-making power of the courts. McConnell presupposes that referees, or editors, should be impartial, consistent, and fair. \u0002et, if the rules themselves are not suYciently clear, consistency is diYcult to achieve where the particular facts of the case raise unique challenges for the application of those rules. Hence, where unique circumstances rest on rulings based on abstract 135 Robert H Bork, \u0091Styles in Constitutio nal \u0001eory \u0092 (1985) Judge: Master or Slave of the Constitution?\u0092 in Michael Rosenfeld (ed), Constitutionalism, Identity, Di\u0003erence, and Legitimacy: \u0002eoretical Perspect ives (Duke UP 1994) 276. 137 Machaj (n 109) 18. 138 Waldron (n 16) 1399. 187 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 instructions, referees, editors, or judges are left to their own convictions on how those rules would apply. \u0001is is the unfortunate reality for commentators seeking impartiality, consistency, or \u0091fairness\u0092 in judicial review. Judges should not be criticised for drawing new abstract moral principles that ultimately overturn legislatively enacted law simply because the connotations of the Constitution's text are broad. It is not that judges are making the \u0091story\u0092 \u0091the best it can be\u0092 in the mere context of a childhood game, as McConnell contextualises it. 139 Rather, in dealing with new constitutional questions regarding an imprecise text, the moral reading provides judges the scope to necessarily consider those questions without being restrained by the framers' expectations. In many cases, those expectations are too outdated to support a contemporary ruling. Hence, it ensures judges are not arbitrarily compromising the democratic equality of those bringing these new constitutional claims because of those \u0091traditional\u0092 values. Moreover, it demonstrates that the two Dworkins cannot be so simply compartmentalised to exploit purported inconsistencies within the moral reading. \u0001e abstract method of judicial review inherent to the Dworkin of Right Answers arises because the Dworkin of Fit instructs judges to show textual \u00aedelity, and eVective textual \u00aedelity would identify is purposefully imprecise. As Sandalow recognises, \u0091[e]ven the most prophetic of the men who drafted and rati\u00aeed the Constitution\u0092 could not foresee the constitutional questions of our time because the questions they had were only of theirs. 140\u0001ey had no stimulus to consider LGBTQ rights, for example. Not only is McConnell's circle story analogy therefore improper in practical terms as it pertains to the two Dworkins but it also fails to recognise that the \u0091story\u0092 began with the abstract drafting of the Constitution, 250 years ago. It should be no surprise that subsequent chapters, which only arise centuries later, diverge from what the framers would have expected. 139 McConnell (n 17) 1275. 140 Sandalow (n 93) 1035. 188 York Law Review Equally, it should not be problematic to accept that judges, in their constitutional role and in respecting the abstract nature of the instructions provided, reach these seemingly novel conclusions. To summarise, McConnell's criticisms result from a misconstruing of the Constitution's abstract language. Not only does he mistake Dworkin's semantic originalism to be inconsistent with democracy, but he mis-conceptualises the moral reading as a betrayal of the judiciary's restrictive editorial role by observing two diVerent \u0091Dworkins\u0092. \u0001e Constitution's text provides ample scope to depart from a static application of the law, and the moral reading inherently embraces this. Dworkin accounted for the constitutional values with which McConnell challenges the moral reading, but with proper appreciation for the consequences of the framers' linguistic choices. 6Conclusion \u0001e moral reading draws criticism for defying the theoretical status quo of judicial review: that judges are bound by textual \u00aedelity to uphold the Constitution's democratic principles, leaving no room for moral readings in judicial decision-making. However, Dworkin's moral reading is far more substantial in its theoretical construction than the unrestrained judicial activism commonly associated with constitutional interpretations that do not seek to determine the framers' speci\u00aec expectations. What makes Dworkin's moral reading tenable is the consideration it aVords to a core trifecta: democratic principles; the Constitution 's text; and the inevitable role of moral judgments in appellate decision- making. Dworkin justi\u00aeed the moral reading on democratic grounds because of the protection it aVords minorities, in contrast to the ordinary \u0091majoritarian\u0092 arrangement of democracy, which fails to properly ful\u00ael the protection of rights in substance that it guarantees in its processes. \u0091Partnership\u0092 democracy addresses the constitutional imbalance for minorities that their rights' concerns may be heard, but they need not be practically addressed. It recti\u00aees the practice of mere head-counting in 189 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 the legislature, which results in the statistical majority determining the validity of those rights, despite the intended purpose of those constitutional guarantees being to enshrine certain rights irrespective of democratic mandate. Hence, Dworkin recognised how constitutional review can positively intervene to strengthen democratic principles. \u0001ough Dworkin 's distinction of semantic and expectational originalism is familiar, it is paramount to properly appreciate that the instructions the framers provided were purposefully abstract, with the knowledge that any judge applying it would need to somehow overcome the lack of precision. Any notions of \u0091tradition\u0092 defy the textual \u00aedelity that expectational originalists claim is the bedrock of their approach because it empowers judges to apply historical quali\u00aecations to fundamental liberties that are unfounded in the text. \u0001is discretionary scope cannot be justi\u00aeed textually. Dworkin therefore posited a framework that he believed could support the challenges associated with the inevitable moral adjudication. Judges are necessarily restrained, but that restraint is itself wide in accordance with the scope of the Constitution's abstract written instructions. \u0001ese abstract instructions refer to grandiose concepts like \u0091liberty\u0092 that inherently require the courts to engage with moral questions of fundamental liberties, questions that are necessarily entangled with the Constitution's text and do not exist within the realm of judges' own moral convictions. \u0001ere are countless other critics of Dworkin 's moral reading oVering diVerent conceptual attacks. 141 However, this article demonstrates that many existing attacks are based on misconceptions of the moral reading, both deliberate and accidental. Moreover, the article concludes that Dworkin provided a logically sound and democratically legitimate conception of judicial review that appropriately navigates the tensions 141 See, for example, Raoul Berger, \u0091Ronald Dworkin's \u0093 \u0001e Moral Reading of the 1099; and Jon \u0091Objectivity, Interpretation, and Rights: A Critique of Dworkin\u0092 (2004) 23 Law and Philosophy 187. 190 York Law Review of democracy, the Constitution's text, and the inevitable role of moral judgments in appellate decision-making. A Game of \u0001rones: \u0001e Battle for the Supremacy of EU Law Following Weiss \u0001 Jakub Kozlowski Abstract \u0001is paper examines the Weiss II judgment delivered by the Federal Constitutional Court in Germany. \u0001e Weiss saga began with a legal challenge to the European Central Bank's Public Sector Purchasing Programme on the grounds that its economic eVects were outside the scope of the bank's mandate. Following this, the German Federal Constitutional Court ruled, for the \u00aerst time in its history, that the preliminary ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Weiss I was ultra vires. \u0001is article analyses the judgment's implications in relation to European Union supremacy and considers whether it forms part of a wider trend, drawing upon cases in the Czech Republic and Denmark. It also examines the eVect this judgment may have if Member States in the future are in dispute with the European Union. \u0001e paper concludes with the view that given the current socio\u0096political climate, particularly in Member States such as Poland and Hungary, this judgment may have set a dangerous precedent. 192 York Law Review 1Introduction On 5 May 2020, the Second Senate of the German Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) delivered its judgment ( Weiss II ) in response to the preliminary ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in the Weiss and others case ( Weiss I ). 1\u0001e case concerned the mandate of the European Central Bank (ECB), which, according to the initial judgment delivered by the CJEU, was managed proportionately. Despite this assessment, the FCC declared, for the \u00aerst time in its history, that the preliminary ruling in Weiss I was ultra vires (beyond the CJEU\u0092s powers). \u0001is paper will \u00aerst provide a background to the Weiss saga. Following this, it will analyse the implications of the judgment for the supremacy of European Union (EU) law and will consider the extent to which this judgment is part of a wider trend. Lastly, it will conclude with some observations regarding the potential future impact this judgment may have, particularly in reference to EU Member States such as Poland and Hungary. \u0001e overall argument presented is that, given the current socio-political climate, especially in these Member States, this judgment may have set a dangerous precedent and, unless the EU take decisive, lawful action, they may not be well placed to respond to these challenges. 2How Did We Get Here? Controlling in\u00afation is essential in every economy and, by keeping prices stable, central banks \u0096 the institutions managing the monetary system of a state or union of states \u0096 are able to ensure that jobs are safe and economies grow. 2 Independent central banks, such as the ECB, are 1 BVerfG, Judgment of the Second Senate of 05 May 2020 \u0097 2 BvR 859/15 ( Weiss II Case and others v Bundesregierung [2018] EU:C 114 (GC, 11 December 2018) ( Weiss I ). 2 European Central Bank, \u0091Why Are Stable Prices Important?\u0092 (European Central 193 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 able to stabilise in\u00afation eYciently as they are politically insulated. 3 In the EU, Article 130 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), one of the EU\u0092s constitutional treaties, provides the ECB with almost complete independence from political interference and exclusive competence on matters of monetary policy, with its main objective being price stability. 4 As a result of the Global Financial Crisis, it was no longer possible to lower interest rates to e\u0002ectively control in\u00afation. 5 To avoid risks of de\u00afation, the ECB introduced non-standard measures, including the Asset Purchase Programme (APP), which sought to introduce price stability to \u00aerms and households across Europe, and was extended in 2015 by the introduction of the Public Sector Purchasing Programme (PSPP). 6\u0001e PSPP can be thought of as a speci\u00aec tool used by the APP, to purchase bonds issued by Eurozone governments, agencies and European institutions. Together, the APP and the PSPP seek to increase in\u00afation, which was a notable challenge following the Global Financial Crisis.

Despite there being a distinction in principle between economic and monetary policy, that is not to suggest that economic and monetary policy can be easily di\u0002erentiated, as the boundaries between the two are often blurred. It is for this reason that the monetary policy has the potential to encroach on economic policy. 9 \u0001is factor, along with the existence of tensions between Member States and the ECB which were underpinned by the \u00aenancial crisis, formed the basis of a legal challenge to the PSPP, in a case that has come to be known as Weiss I . \u0001e claimants asked the FCC to decide whether: athe ECB went beyond its monetary policy mandate and pursued an economic policy through the PSPP; and bthe ECB violated the German constitution by preventing the Parliament from controlling the country's public \u00aenances. 10 7 April 2021. 9\u0001ere is substantial overlap between the monetary and the e conomic policy and this is recognised by the ECB Statute.

See Protocol (No 4) on the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank at <https://eur- lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A12016E%2FPRO%2F04> accessed 06 of the German Constitutional Court\u0092 (2020) Hertie School Policy Paper 195 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 To answer the \u00aerst question posed by the claimants, the FCC pursued the preliminary reference procedure, asking the CJEU if the ECB had breached Article 123 of TFEU and if it had violated its mandate regarding monetary policy. 11 In its judgment, the CJEU ruled that the PSPP was compatible with EU law and there was no breach. 12 Furthermore, adopting a purposive approach, the CJEU held that the provisions within the TFEU did not intend to make a complete separation between economic and monetary policies. 13 It suggested that, in practice, some overlap between these policies was necessary for the ECB to pursue its objectives. 14 Finally, the CJEU found that the measures enacted as part of the PSPP were proportionate and did not go beyond the necessary means to achieve its objectives. 15 \u0001is legal saga reached its climax when the FCC delivered its judgment in Weiss II , which ultimately disagreed with the preliminary ruling of the CJEU. \u0001is action alone was extreme. \u0001e purpose of the preliminary reference procedure is solely to facilitate cooperation between the CJEU and national courts. 16 Instead of interpreting EU law in cases of doubt, a national court must refer questions to the CJEU. When the judgment returns to the national court, that court must uphold it. However, in Weiss II , the FCC did quite the opposite and declared the judgment of the CJEU and the PSPP ultra vires. <https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-hsog/frontdoor/index/index/docId/3524> accessed Framework\u0092 Journal of European and Comparative Law 449, 451. 12Weiss I (n 1) paras 100, 144, 158. 13Weiss I (n 1) para 60. 14Weiss I (n 1) para 67. 15Weiss I (n 1) para 100. 16 Michal Bobek, \u0091Learning to Talk: Preliminary Rulings, the Courts of the New Member States and the Court of Justice\u0092 (2008) 45(6) CMLR 1611. 196 York Law Review In what some may deem an attack on the CJEU's application of proportionality in Weiss I , the FCC held that \u0091suitability and necessity [were] not balanced against the economic policy e\u0002ects\u0092, meaning its application of proportionality was \u00afawed. 17\u0001e FCC criticised the CJEU for its failure to consider the economic e\u0002ects of the PSPP; this, according to the FCC, resulted in the ECB having freedom to choose any measures within its mandate, even if such measures were harmful to Member States. 18 Consequently, the failure of the CJEU to properly undertake the proportionality analysis meant it exceeded its competences; it was for this reason that the FCC declared the preliminary ruling ultra vires. 19 \u0001e FCC adopted a similar approach in relation to the second question posed by the claimants. In considering the remit of the ECB, the FCC held that it did not balance the economic e\u0002ects of the PSPP with its monetary policy objective; it was on this basis that the FCC constituted the creation of the PSPP as being an ultra vires act. 20 As a result, the FCC held that the German government must require the ECB to conduct a comprehensive proportionality assessment of the PSPP. 21 Following Weiss II , this assessment was successfully carried out, thus permitting the continuation of the PSPP in Germany. 22 17 Franz C Mayer, \u0091 To Boldly Go Where No Court Has Gone Before. \u0001e German Federal Constitutional Court's Ultra Vires Decision of May 5, 2020\u0092 (2020) 21(5) German LJ 1116, 1117; Weiss II (n para 133. 18Weiss I (n 1) para 140. 19Weiss I (n 1) headnote 2. 20Weiss I (n 1) para 176. 21 Although it has been argued that there was no basis in the German Constitution for the Federal Constitutional Court to legally instruct the government and parliament \u0091to ensure that the ECB conducts a proportionality assessment in relation to the PSPP\u0092.

However, this only considers the judgment as a sum of its facts. Looking at the judgment more closely, and considering what it represents, we can identify the signi\u00aecant challenges it presents for EU law. \u0001e decision in Weiss II was the result of a national court declaring a judgment delivered by the CJEU, and a programme legally mandated by EU law, ultra vires, which may have signi\u00aecant consequences for the supremacy of EU law. \u0001e principle of supremacy was established by case law. In Costa v ENEL , the CJEU stated that, by joining the Community, Member States \u0091have limited their rights\u0092. 23 It was later con\u00aermed in Simmenthal that the principle of supremacy principle applies to any piece of national law that contradicts EU law. 24\u0001is means that even the constitution of a Member State must be displaced if it is in con\u00afict with EU law. In Solange I , the FCC considered the principle of supremacy, but had diYculty in accepting that EU law would prevail over the national constitution. 25 As a result, the FCC placed numerous conditions on the supremacy of EU law when in con\u00afict with national issues to protect and uphold constitutional rights. Following this decision, the FCC considered the case of Solange II and seemingly took a more moderate approach. 26 It was held that, so long as EU law protected the fundamental rights of German citizens, it would not be subject to any 23 Case 6/64 Flaminio Costa v ENEL ). Case October 1986) para 339 ( Solange II). 198 York Law Review review by the national judiciary. 27 However, if EU institutions, such as the ECB, were found to exceed their powers codi\u00aeed by the treaties, any subsequent acts made by those institutions would not be legally binding in Germany. 28 Nevertheless, the FCC also held that the CJEU would always be given an opportunity to provide a preliminary ruling in cases where national law con\u00aficted with EU law. 29 In the light of this, it should not be too surprising that the FCC came to the conclusion they did in Weiss II . Notwithstanding the history underpinning the judgment in Weiss II , it is also possible that the decision was part of a wider trend. Interestingly, it is not the \u00aerst time a national court has taken a decision that has undermined the supremacy of EU law. We perhaps \u00aerst saw the beginning of this trend in 2012, when the Czech Constitutional Court declared a judgment delivered by the CJE U ultra vires. \u0001is case concerned a dispute between the two succession states, following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, whereby the Czech Republic sought to award special pension increments only to Czech citizens. 30\u0001is was not only in breach of the agreement come to by the two succession states but, according to the CJEU in Landtov\u00e1 , it also contravened EU law surrounding the protection from discrimination on the grounds of nationality. 31 In response, the Czech Constitutional Court held that the CJEU went beyond its competences as it omitted to give due consideration to the unique legal situation created by the dissolution of Czechoslovakia. 32 27 ibid. 28 Case 9\u009672 Brunner v \u0002e Federal Republic of Germany (4 October 1972). 29Weiss II (n 1). 30 Jan Kom\u00e1rek, \u0091 Playing with Matches: \u0001e Czech Constitutional Court Declares a Judgment of t he Court of Justice of the EU Ultra Vires; Judgment of 31 January 2012, Pl. \u00daS 5/12, Slovak Pensions XVII\u0092 (2012) 8 EuConst Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 Only four years later, in 2016, the Supreme Court of Denmark heard the Ajos case, which concerned a con\u00afict between a Danish statute, permitting an employee's allowance to be revoked based on their age, with the protection against age discrimination enshrined in EU law. 33 In its preliminary ruling, the CJEU held that a national court cannot claim it is unable to interpret national law in a manner compatible with EU law merely because that court had earlier applied national provisions that were inconsistent with EU law. 34\u0001e Danish Supreme Court disagreed with this assessment and held that, at the time of Denmark joining the Community, protection from discrimination on the grounds of age was not codi\u00aeed in the treaties, thus permitting them to disapply the regulation. 35 Both cases in the Czech Republic and Denmark represent a departure from the principle of EU supremacy. In both circumstances, the European Commission would have been permitted to bring infringement proceedings against the Member States in violation. Infringement proceedings are used as a tool that requires Member States to comply with EU law, usually through the form of a formal request. Where Member States choose not to comply, the case may be referred to the CJEU to consider the imposition of \u00aenancial penalties. 36 Surprisingly, neither Member State has faced any consequences for contravening the principle of EU supremacy. In both cases, it is unclear why no further action was taken. However, it is arguable that, by 33 Case C\u009615/2014 Ajos A/S v Estate of A [2016] OJ C211/12 ; Nguyen and Chamon (n 10) 8. 34 Case 441/14 Dansk Industri v (GC, 19 Court's Ajos Judgment (Dansk Industri): Rejecting a Consistent Interpretation and Challenging the E\u0002ect of a General Principle of EU Law in the Danish Legal Order\u0092 (2017) 10(1) REA Law 135, 138\u009639. procedure\u0092 (European Commission) <https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-making-process/applying-eu-law/infringement- procedure_en> accessed 6 April 2021. 200 York Law Review omitting to initiate infringement proceedings, the EU may have facilitated a wider trend whereby national courts have rejected the supremacy of EU law in favour of national measures. Inevitably, this is problematic, as Mayer rightly notes: \u0091if every Member State claimed the \u00aenal word on EU law, we could kiss the European community of law and the idea of a common legal system good-bye\u0092. 37 Of course, in the context of the Weiss saga, bringing infringement proceedings against Germany would no longer be reasonable as the matter has already been settled by the German government. However, this should act as a warning to the European Commission that they should be ready to adopt a tougher stance against Member States who infringe EU law. Without further action, we may observe a continuing trend whereby Member States, such as Poland and Hungary, two Member States currently experiencing challenges to the rule of law from within their national governments, are able to selectively apply EU law at national level. 4A Dangerous Precedent One does not need to look much further beyond the socio-political climate in Poland and Hungary to conceive the potential consequences of the Weiss II judgment. In both countries, a rule of law crisis has emerged amidst the actions of right-leaning governments. 38 It has been argued elsewhere that it would be diYcult to apply the Weiss II judgment to the context of Poland and Hungary, as the rule of law crisis is a matter completely distinct from the issues raised by the PSPP. 39 37 Mayer (n 17) 1118. 38 James Shotter and Valerie Hopkins, \u0091Hungary and Poland Stand Firm against EU Rule of Law Conditions\u0092 Financial Times (London, 18 November 2020) <https://www.ft.com/content/6868477d-38a2-464e-b1c4-188fd0a62b1a> accessed 6 April 2021. 39 Von Matthias Jestaedt, \u0091Keine Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 14 May 27 February 2021. 201 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 However, it is argued here that the principle of undermining EU law is easily transferable and it is plausible that Poland and Hungary will adopt the principles underpinning the Weiss II judgment to their bene\u00aet. Indeed, in May 2020, Hungary's justice minister stated that \u0091the fact that [the] CJEU has been overruled is extremely important\u0092 and Poland's deputy justice minister claimed that \u0091the EU says only as much as we, the Members States, allow it\u0092. 40 It is diYcult to predict with precision the context in which Weiss II may be used in both Member States. However, the context may centre around the judicial independence crisis in Poland and the \u0091Stop Soros\u0092 laws in Hungary. In Poland, the creation of the Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court by the Law and Justice Party, the largest party in the Polish parliament, is thought to have displaced an independent judicial system. 41 Owing to the enactment of recent legislation, the Chamber has the authority to prosecute members of the judiciary or deprive them of their judicial mandate if they are found to criticise the government. 42 In the context of Hungary, the Parliament has passed the \u0091Stop Soros\u0092 legislation, which \u0091criminalises activities that support asylum and residence applications and further restricts the right to request asylum\u0092. 43\u0001is legislation has been condemned 41 Maria Wilczek, \u0091\u0093 \u0001e Co urts Are Destroyed for at Least 20 \u0005ears\u0094: Poland's Supreme Court Chief Looks Back on Her Term\u0092 (Notes from Poland, 3 April 2020). 42 Dz.U.2021. 154, Art 27. 43 \u0091Stop Soros\u0092 legislation includes: Bill T/19776 on the permits for organisations supporting migra tion; Bill T/19774 on the immigration restraint order; and Bill T/19775 on the immigration funding fee.

Perhaps the most signi\u00aecant question posed by this paper is how Weiss II will in\u00afuence the response of the Polish and Hungarian governments with respect to the future judgments delivered by the CJEU. Even though neither Member State would be acting in a novel way by disapplying EU law, they may, as a result of the judgment in Weiss II , feel especially empowered to do so. Indeed, there persists a view that the judgment will permit both governments to set aside the decisions of the CJEU where this con\u00aficts with a political agenda \u0097 a view diYcult to quash considering the initial failure to ameliorate the concerns of the European Commission. 46 It remains to be seen how the CJEU will proceed in relation to the measures adopted by the Member States, and equally how the Member States will respond to the judgments.

In the examples outlined in this paper, no Member State has been sanctioned by the EU for their infringement of EU law. We will never know whether invoking the relevant procedures at the time would have e\u0002ectively brought an end to the apparent trend. However, this paper has argued that, by taking lawful action against Member States who seek to infringe EU law, the EU is better placed to uphold the principle of supremacy, particularly in light of the challenges posed by Member States such as Poland and Hungary. It's Not All Zoom and Gloom: Re\u00afections on University Study During COVID\u009619 Fraser King Abstract \u0001e ongoing COVID \u009619 pandemic has presented varying challenges for students and te aching sta\u0002 alike. \u0001e diYculty of transitioning from traditional in person teaching to an online delivery of teaching that students and teaching sta\u0002 are now well- acquainted with cannot be understated. \u0001is article analyses the challenges that have arisen as a result of the pandemic and o\u0002ers re\u00afections on these diYculties from the author\u0092s two di\u0002erent perspectives within \u0005ork Law School \u0097 \u00aerst as a Master of Laws student and, second, as a graduate teaching assistant. In particular, this paper will focus on how the COVID-19 pandemic has a\u0002ected the delivery of the \u0005ork Law School\u0092s problem-based learning methods and the process of completing an independent dissertation project. Finally, this paper o\u0002ers thoughtful recommendations for the future of teaching and learning at higher education. 205 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 1Introduction \u0001e C OVID\u009619 global pandemic led, in March 2020, to the United Kingdom being placed into an unprecedented national lockdown. A consequence of the lockdown measures was the dramatic transition from teaching in person to online delivery in higher education. \u0001e diYculty of adjusting well-established teaching techniques to an online environment cannot be understated; the fact that universities across the country continued to teach students throughout the di\u0002ering stages of the pandemic should be applauded. As a Master of Laws (LLM) student at \u0005ork Law School (\u0005LS), having graduated from \u0005LS with a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree in 2020, and also as a Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA), I have experienced \u00aerst-hand the implications of the period of disruption caused by COVID\u009619. My LLM was a one-year programme composed entirely of option modules, most of which were delivered through problem-based learning (PBL): a form of student-centred pedagogy where students learn about areas of law through the experience of solving legal problems identi\u00aeed in an initial scenario. \u0001roughout my time as an LLM student, I experienced the challenges of learning in a new online environment. At the same time, as a GTA, involved in teaching elements of the undergraduate law programme for \u00aerst- and second- year students, I have had a unique viewpoint on the impact of the pandemic in higher education, having experienced it as a member of the teaching sta\u0002. In this paper, I will, \u00aerst, re\u00afect upon the impact that the COVID\u009619 pandemic has had on the delivery of PBL, drawing upon my experiences as a student and a GTA. Second, I will consider the challenges I faced whilst conducting an independent research project under pandemic restrictions and how I overcame these diYculties. 206 York Law Review 2Problem-Based Learning \u0001roughout the pandemic, the most marked change in the context of higher education has been the transition from in-person teaching to online delivery. \u0001e ethos of \u0005LS is largely one of collaboration and this is core to its teaching methods, including its unique PBL style, adopted for both undergraduate and postgraduate study. Before re\u00afecting upon the impact of COVID\u009619 on the delivery of PBL, this paper will \u00aerst provide an overview of the PBL process. 2.1 Overview For the duration of each academic year, students at \u0005LS are divided into student law \u00aerms (SLFs), where they are expected and encouraged to collaborate with one another for the entirety of the PBL process. As SLFs are largely self-regulated, each group may approach PBL in a slightly di\u0002erent manner. \u0001e PBL approach aims to both increase legal knowledge and to teach students to act ethically and solve complex problems. 1 Additionally, there is no emphasis on \u0091right\u0092 or \u0091wrong\u0092 sources to use, meaning that, in terms of pedagogy, students, through conducting independent research, discover a range of sources they \u00aend to be useful. 2\u0001e PBL process, whilst daunting at \u00aerst, has been bene\u00aecial for my own development. As I look to legal practice in the future, I have gained a valuable skill set in applying abstract legal knowledge and principles to factual situations. \u0001e PBL process works on a cyclical basis , each week being one full cycle. Usually, two sessions are delivered at the beginning or end of each week, with one interim session sandwiched in between. A typical PBL seminar is formed of two halves: the feeding back of the previous 1 Jenny Gibbons, \u0091Re\u00afection, Realignment and Refraction: Bernstein's Evaluative Rules and the Summative Assessment of Re\u00afective Practice in a Problem-Based Learning Programme\u0092 (2019) 24(7) Teaching in Higher Education 834, 836. 2 Richard Grimes, \u0091Delivering Legal Education through an Integrated Problem-Based Learning Model \u0097 the Nuts and Bolts\u0092 (2014) 21(2) 228, 253. 207 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 week's problem scenario and the \u0091pick-up\u0092 of a new problem. In a typical PBL session, a student in the SLF will be appointed as chairperson, who will act in a leadership capacity, and another student will be appointed as a scribe, who will record the whole process for the group. During the pick-up phase, the tutor will distribute scenarios to the SLF ; these scenarios are \u00aectional legal problems that usually relate to content from two areas of law. \u0001e objective of this part of the session is to work collaboratively to identify these problems. To do so, students thoroughly process the problem scenario by clarifying any unclear terms, identifying the key parties and their interests, along with the key facts, then summarising and naming the scenario. Finally, students brainstorm any legal issues they believe to be related to the problem, which leads to the development of ideas or questions for further independent research. Following the independent research process, the students will present their \u00aendings to the SLF and then apply the law to the factual matrix within the scenario. \u0001is both reinforces the substantive legal knowledge gained from research and practises the skill of applying the law in real-life situations. Each week there are interim sessions that take place in between the main PBL seminars. In these sessions, the students present their initial \u00aendings on the problem scenario. \u0001e role of the tutor in interim sessions is to facilitate and encourage the students to further develop their own research skills, rather than give correct answers or provide a list of sources to consult. After the interim session, students continue their research and then apply it to the problem scenario in advance of their next PBL seminar, where they feedback their completed and detailed research to the tutor and fellow students. Additionally, to further support students, lectures, known at \u0005LS as plenaries, are delivered to coincide with the content relevant to a given week's PBL problem. Prior to the COVID\u009619 restrictions, plenaries were delivered as interactive, in-person lectures, meaning students 208 York Law Review could pose questions to lecturers. However, due to the COVID\u009619 pandemic, plenaries were pre-recorded by teaching sta\u0002 and uploaded for students to access at their convenience. Despite the lack of interactivity, this new format permitted me, as an LLM student, to make more comprehensive notes as I was able to set aside suYcient time to watch and understand the content. Drawing from my experience on the LLB at \u0005LS, I believe plenaries being delivered in an online format has been more bene\u00aecial for my learning. \u0001is brings me to question whether, when we look to the future, a hybrid approach that incorporates the bene\u00aets of online plenaries, coupled with in-person seminars, could be adopted in higher education. 2.2 PBL from a Student Perspective PBL, even without the challenges associated with COVID\u009619, has been a challenging style of learning to adapt to. \u0001ese sessions are facilitated by PBL tutors at \u0005LS, in line with the important pedagogical objectives that underpin PBL. \u0001e sessions primarily focu s on conducting productive research, and application of the law to the factual matrix of the week\u0092s scenario. When picking up a new problem scenario as an undergraduate, I often struggled to maintain a balance between capturing the required level of detail to suYciently complete the learning objectives and moving swiftly through the process. \u0001roughout my experience as an LLM student, where the delivery of teaching has been solely online, I have found that this problem was not necessarily replicated as, initially, we tended to move eYciently through the stages of PBL. Instead, attending the sessions online meant I felt almost disconnected from the other students in the SLF and we appeared to be more concerned with establishing the relevant learning outcomes eYciently than working collaboratively to achieve this. As a result, in the \u00aerst term, I felt that successfully working through particularly challenging problems was less rewarding than it had been throughout my undergraduate experience, where the delivery of PBL had mostly been in person. 209 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 \u0001e lack of collaboration could be attributed to the online setting , which felt at times like arti\u00aecial separation between me and the other members of the SLF, meaning I felt less familiar with who I was working with. Prior to the pandemic, I would often work closely with students in my SLF, especially if I had been having diYculty navigating the research. Owing to the restrictions on social contact as a result of COVID\u009619, I was unable to meet with my fellow students in person and, unless I arranged to collaborate in an online setting, I mostly worked independently. \u0001is meant that I felt less certain of the quality of my research and I was often less forthcoming in the following week's feedback session. During the second term, after previously experiencing a disconnect with my fellow students, I consciously made attempts to facilitate positive discussions within the PBL setting, particularly when acting as the chairperson. I would often directly ask members of the SLF to participate, which initially led to stilted silences and, occasionally, instances of students accidentally speaking over one another. Eventually, the SLF established a \u0091hands up\u0092 policy, meaning we would take it in turns to contribute our thoughts by \u00aerst signalling to the chairperson our intention to do so. Consequently, I felt more con\u00aedent in sharing my contributions with the group, without fear of interrupting another student. I believe this also had a positive e\u0002ect on other quieter members of the group who previously did not frequently contribute to ongoing discussions. \u0001is was not a perfect method , as it did not permit a free-\u00afowing discussion that may be expected in an in-person setting, but it did remedy some of the problems associated with online delivery. Whilst individual members of the SLF attempted to facilitate discussions, these e\u0002orts were greatly assisted by the tutor. Within online sessions, tutors tended to adapt their teaching style to be more proactive in encouraging contributions through leading questions or suggesting potentially fruitful areas of discussion. \u0001is adaption of teaching style aided the SLF, encouraging us to work collaboratively whilst still successfully working through the legal problems generated 210 York Law Review by the scenario. Furthermore, the leading questions asked by the tutor prompted me to do further independent research around the topic that consequently informed my understanding of the week\u0092s scenario. As I have experienced, the role of a tutor is a challenging one \u0096 especially during the restrictions in place due to COVID-19. Whilst it is a tutor\u0092s role to encourage productive academic conversations, it can be diYcult to create an atmosphere of academic community and collaboration in a virtual environment. Despite this, tutors continued to deliver outstanding teaching and support in PBL sessions, in line with the \u0005LS\u0092s intentional student-centred pedagogy. \u0001e experience of online learning in a group setting has demonstrated the importance of developing and maintaining positive relationships with colleagues. As the use of online platforms may become part of normality, even after COVID\u009619 restrictions have ceased, I will ensure that I cultivate meaningful relationships with colleagues in order to encourage collaborative and friendly interaction both within and outside formal meetings. 2.3 PBL from the GTA Perspective Whilst completing the LLM course, I delivered virtual interim sessions as a GTA. During this time, I observed that the levels of attendance and preparedness of students had not been disproportionately a\u0002ected by the shift to online delivery ; however, having previously attended interim sessions whilst completing my LLB, I did notice a reduction in participation. It appeared as though students were less forthcoming in sharing their initial research \u00aendings, which may, as I found during PBL for the LLM, have been a result of the lack of familiarity students had with their peers. A further challenge I identi\u00aeed in my capacity as a GTA was the technological constraints some students faced. I was often unsure whether students were unable to contribute owing to having poor- quality microphones or webcams, or whether they needed further 211 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 support on the content being delivered. \u0001is was a challenge I had not anticipated having to face initially, but one I became more accustomed to as the academic year progressed. In the second term, after getting to know the students, I felt more con\u00aedent in my ability to successfully encourage students to participate. I was able to recognise that some students felt more comfortable or, as a result of their technology, were only able to contribute using the \u0091chat\u0092 function on Zoom. Eventually, I encouraged the use of this function, which ultimately increased the level of participation within the interim sessions. To understand the challenges that the students were facing, I drew upon my experiences as a \u0005LS undergraduate student. For instance, whilst completing my LLB, I often struggled to identify the most appropriate legal so urces, including textbooks and case law. \u0001erefore, when delivering the interim sessions, I ensured students were completing their research using appropriate material and, where necessary, I would encourage students to consider alternative sources to enhance their independent research. Re\u00afecting upon my own experiences also allowed me to grow in con\u00aedence in the role, as I could ensure I guided the students to develop their research skills. Additionally, I was able to share my own experiences with the students during the interim sessions to help them understand the purpose of PBL. It felt particularly rewarding when sharing this guidance with students actually encouraged participation and, on occasion, when individual students would thank me for my delivery of the interim session. Working as a GTA has been an enjoyable experience and one I would recommend to other students considering further education at master's or PhD level. \u0001e role was enriching as I was able to work with the same groups of students throughout the academic year and could chart their development and con\u00aedence. I could also apply this journey at a personal level, as I learned to adapt my own style of teaching to accommodate the needs of others and work \u00afexibly in a challenging and unce rtain time. \u0001ese skills will bene\u00aet me in my own future career in the legal sector. 212 York Law Review 3\u0001e Dissertation Project COVID\u009619 has undoubtedly had a signi\u00aecant impact upon the delivery of learning in higher education, but it has also noticeably a\u0002ected independent research projects. At \u0005LS, independent research tasks usually take the form of a dissertation, a project that spans the whole academic year, with a word limit of 10,000 words at undergraduate level and 12,000 at master's level. As both my undergraduate and master's dissertations were completed under restrictions caused by the COVID\u009619 pandemic, I have faced signi\u00aecant challenges in completing these research tasks. A substantial element of any dissertation project is the consultation and analysis of a range of sources, often made possible by access through the library facilities. However, in March 2020 the university library, along with all other study spaces across campus, closed and during that time access to those resources was inherently limited. \u0001e library reopened in July 2020 and, ever since, its capacity has been limited, with a requirement to book study spaces in advance. \u0001roughout my time as an undergraduate student, I used the library as a study space. Inevitably, when the library closed, this disrupted my working pattern and I found that my productivity was negatively impacted. Just as many of us were required to do, I adapted my home environment to accommodate my study needs. \u0001is was particularly challenging for me, as I was previously accustomed to having a separation of work and home life. Further, despite the increased provision of online resources and most key texts being available, I also found it diYcult to adapt to consulting materials in an online form, rather than in hard copy. \u0001ese challenges I faced as a result of the C OVID\u009619 restrictions meant I experienced some diYculties completing my undergraduate dissertation project. \u0001e project itself focussed on police negligence and the respective high levels of immunity from liability. In order to answer my research questions, I initially intended to take a sociolegal approach in one chapter, analysing the role of the police in society and its relation 213 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 to negligence in the sphere of tort. At the time, a sociolegal approach to research was largely unfamiliar to me and, as access to resources was diYcult at this time, I did not feel con\u00aedent continuing with this approach. Consequently, I felt it would be appropriate to adapt my dissertation project accordingly and I took a wholly doctrinal approach to answering the research question. Despite initially feeling disappointed that I wouldn't be able to pursue a project outside my comfort zone, it also highlighted to me the importance of being \u00afexible and adaptable, particularly in challenging times. My undergraduate dissertation was the \u00aerst time I had conducted a larger-scale independent research project and, consequently, I found it challenging to e\u0002ectively manage my time. For other assessments that I had completed as part of my undergraduate degree, I found that working in a collaborative environment in the library with other students who were experiencing the same process of writing and studying alleviated my anxieties and helped me to focus on my work. Due to the COVID\u009619 restrictions, this was not possible, and I completed most of my dissertation in isolation. As a result, I often struggled to motivate myself to complete the work, which was exacerbated by the lack of interaction with fellow students. In order to successfully complete the dissertation, I developed skills to help me manage the workload. I initially felt overwhelmed by the scale of the project and found it diYcult to envisage the project as a whole. To combat this, I was able to break the project down into smaller, more manageable components and would set myself smaller goals accordingly, such as reading and understanding a journal article. Once I had completed the task, I would feel a sense of achievement, which would motivate me to progress to another task. I carried this approach forward to my master's dissertation, which, despite being a larger project, felt more manageable than my undergraduate dissertation. 214 York Law Review 4Conclusion In this paper, I have considered the signi\u00aecant impacts that COVID\u009619 has had on the delivery of learning at \u0005LS. Drawing upon my experiences as a master's student and a GTA, I have re\u00afected upon the delivery of online teaching and learning in the context of PBL and an independent dissertation project. \u0001is paper has established that t he value of in-person teaching and access to in-person resources cannot be understated, particularly in the context of \u0005LS, where collaboration is at the core of its pedagogy. \u0001is was inevitably harder to replicate in an online setting which posed additional challenges for students and tutors respectively, including, in some cases, a reduction in participation. As we look to return to in-person delivery of teaching and learning in higher education, hopefully these challenges will be remedied. Nevertheless, it has been important to recognise and re\u00afect upon the valuable skills that have been acquired to successfully collaborate with others in an online environmen t. \u0001e development of these skills could be essential in the future, where we may see a hybrid approach to education, with some aspects of courses being delivered virtually and others in person. Considering this from the perspective of \u0005LS, elements of both the LLB and LLM, including plenaries, could be successfully delivered in an online setting, with PBL, where possible, being delivered in person to achieve the desired collaboration. \u0091\u0001ey Were Supposed to Protect Us \u0092: Analysing Patriarchy and the Work of Human Rights Defenders in Nigeria Nabila Okino Abstract In challenging oppressive systems around the world, human rights defenders (HRDs) put themselves at risk of violence, as well as forms of mistreatment within their communities. HRDs working on women's rights issues, including initiatives against sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), are often confronted with challenges in the public and private spheres that are perpetrated by state and non-state actors. Some challenges are grounded in patriarchal hegemony, which in turn informs the creation of family, institutional, and religious structures. \u0001is paper aims to understand how patriarchy impacts on the activities of HRDs working on SGBV initiatives. Grounded in the empirical research of defenders working in Nigeria, the paper undertakes a sociolegal analysis of patriarchy and its manifestations in religion, human rights law, and the human rights movement. It \u00aends that patriarchy plays a critical role in shaping the work of HRDs and their ability to make an impact. Chief among the paper's conclusions is the \u00aending that patriarchy plays a role in bolstering fundamentalist ideals, which shape societal perceptions on the role and status of women. \u0001is e\u0002ectively informs institutional responses to the issue of SGBV and the work of HRDs. \u0001e paper also \u00aends that , whilst patriarchal constraints persist, HRDs have found creative ways of navigating these challenges by negotiating patriarchal systems through the use of male HRDs and persistent lobbying. \u0001is ultimately facilitates entry into hard-to-reach spaces, such as the male-dominated legislature, communities, and religious institutions, while still positioning women defenders at the forefront of activities against SGBV. 216 York Law Review 1Introduction \u0001e patriarchal nature of Nigerian society creates and embeds structures of inequality, which puts men in dominant positions and women in subservient positions. 1 According to Allanana Makama, this inequality is manifested in \u0091discriminatory laws, socially constructed norms of femininity and masculinity, gender roles and stereotypes and unequal access to economic and political power\u0092. 2\u0001e cumulative e\u0002ects of these constraints is a society where women's rights and bodily agency become secondary considerations to their male counterparts'. Sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) constitutes one form of this inequality. General Recommendation No 35 of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) notes that SGBV is pervasive across a range of settings, from private and public spaces to technological spheres, and is perpetrated by \u0091states, intergovernmental organisations or non-state actors\u0092. 3\u0001is inequality has contributed to the prevalence of SGBV across all levels of society in Nigeria, such as the family, educational and religious settings, markets, and even the workplace. 4\u0001e culture of shaming victims, which often leads to their ostracisation from communities, has further contributed to their silence. 5\u0001is has, over time, hampered the mainstreaming of conversations about SGBV and prevented the enactment and enforcement of legislation that may address this pressing issue. \u0001e Nigerian state has systemically failed to institute adequate legislative, judicial, and executive structures to curb the prevalence of 1 Godiya Allanana Makama, \u0091 Patriarchy and Gender Inequality in Nigeria: \u0001e Way Forward\u0092 (2013) 9 European Scienti\u00aec Journal 17, 116. 2\u0001e World Bank, \u0091Gender-Based Violence: An Analysis of the Implication for the Nigerian Women Project\u0092 (\u0001e World Bank 2019) 4. 3 UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), \u0091CEDAW General Recommendation No. 35 on Gender-Based Violence against Women, Updating General Recommendation No.19\u0092 (CEDAW/C/GC/35, 14 July 2017), para 20. 4\u0001e World Bank (n 2). 5\u0001e World Bank (n 2). 217 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 SGBV, and to prioritise the rights of women and hold perpetrators accountable. Human rights defenders (HRDs) continue to conduct sensitisation initiatives, organise protests, provide psychosocial and legal support to victims, and champion advocacy across all levels of government. 6\u0001rough these activities, HRDs have provided safe spaces and s upport for victims of SGBV in Nigeria. \u0001eir activism has also led to some legislative change and emboldened victims to speak about their experiences. 7 In the course of their work, however, HRDs working on SGBV encounter multilayered obstacles that emanate from social, family, and state structures, cultural practices, and religious institutions in Nigeria. \u0001is can often lead to HRDs being physically and verbally abused, ostracised from their communities, disowned, and in some instances targeted by smear campaigns perpetrated by both state and non-state actors. 8\u0001ese challenges stem from patriarchal ideals that limit how HRDs, especially women human rights defenders (WHRDs), can exercise their agency \u0097 thereby impacting on their ability to conduct their activities. 9 Recognising the pivotal role HRDs play in the protection spectrum, this paper seeks to understand how patriarchy in\u00afuences the activities of HRDs working on SGBV initiatives in Nigeria. Drawing upon in-depth qualitative interviewing and broad-based interdisciplinary research, the 6 \u0091Human rights defender\u0092 is a term used to describe people who, individually or with others, act to promote or protect human rights in a peaceful manner; they can be individuals and non-governmental organisations (NGOs).

Within the context of this paper, the protection spectrum includes human rights litigation, advocacy and the formation of human rights norms and institutions at the domestic, regional and international levels. 218 York Law Review following discussions examine the concept of patriarchy, its role in shaping human rights law, and how it in\u00afuences activities within the human rights movement. \u0001e paper commences with an introduction to the background of SGBV in Nigeria and the role that HRDs have come to play in \u00aelling practice and protection gaps left by institutional inaction. Following this, the discussion will engage with critical perspectives on the contested concept of patriarchy that are set forth in the social sciences scholarship. \u0001e literature will analyse cross - disciplinary, scholarly, and practitioner works on patriarchy, how it plays out within the human rights project, and its threat to the security and wellbeing of HRDs. Not considered in the following literature review, however, is literature on patriarchal communities. \u0001is is due to the limited research conducted in this \u00aeeld and speci\u00aecally on HRDs working within the Nigerian context. In providing deeper context of the activities and challenges of HRDs in Nigeria, this paper brie\u00afy outlines the HRD framework and Nigeria's laws, policies, and international obligations. \u0001e paper will conclude by summarising the research \u00aendings, which highlight the role of cultural and religious fundamentalism in shaping societal perceptions and institutional responses to the activities of HRDs working on SGBV issues. It will also discuss how HRDs navigate patriarchy through compromise and male allyship. As part of the empirical research, seven WHRDs and three male HRDs (MHRDs) were interviewed. \u0001rough engagement with the literature and drawing from the experiences of these HRDs, this paper therefore contributes to the limited but growing research on the activities of HRDs by examining and understanding the constraints posed by patriarchy, which may aid the e\u0002ectiveness of the activities of HRDs working on initiatives against SGBV in Nigeria. 219 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 2Literature Review \u0001e opening section of this paper discusse d how the activities of HRDs can put them at risk of violence and violations of their human rights. \u0001e literature considers these challenges at length, most often focussing on the analysis of patriarchy and its relationship with religion, human rights law, and the human rights movement. It discusses how these challenges can lead to the shrinking of the civic space, which can create an environment where HRDs are vili\u00aeed and their activities criminalised. 10 HRDs face a range of intersecting challenges that are based on gender, stereotypical notions of femininity and masculinity, culture, and religion. Shaped by a range of factors such as community, ethno-religious institutions, and public structures, some of the challenges and push-back that HRDs encounter stem from the patriarchal ideologies that people continuously interface with in their everyday lives. As this section illustrates, patriarchal systems, both social and legal, go beyond the creation of oppressive systems and structures, extending to sti\u00afing and supressing voices and initiatives \u00aeghting for women's rights. 2.1 Understanding Patriarchy Patriarchy has been subjected to various conceptual interpretations at di\u0002erent points in history and in di\u0002erent socio-spatial spheres. 11 In its 10 Civic Space is the political, legislative, social, and economic environment that enables citizens to come together, share their interests and concerns and act individually and collectively to in\u00afuence and shape the policymaking (https://civicspacewatch.eu/what-is-civic-space/). Michel Forst, \u0091World Report on the Situation of Human Rights Defenders\u0092 (United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights Defenders, December 2018) 8; Editorial, \u0091Report of the Challenges Faced by Women in Civil Society in Nigeria\u0092 ( CIVICUS , March 2011) 11 Fionnuala N\u00ed Aol\u00e1in, \u0091Women, Security, and the Patriarchy of Internationalized Transitional Justice\u0092 (2009) 31 HRQ 4, 1060. 220 York Law Review earliest socialised iteration, patriarchy was primarily understood as domination by the father, grandfather, son, or other older male \u00aegure over women or younger men in a household or family. 12 Men were deemed to be \u0091naturally\u0092 placed to function as heads of the family, a position that has been shored up by socio-economic factors, culture, and religious constructs. 13\u0001e entrenched societal perception of men as protectors and providers has extended to control over familial property, decision-making and even the sexuality and reproductive rights of women. 14 In contrast, as Chisale notes, women's roles in the family stereotypically centre around catering, nurturing the family, and satisfying male sexual desires. 15 In her in\u00afuential work \u0002eorising Patriarchy , Walby de\u00aenes patriarchy as \u0091a system of social structures and practices in which men dominate, oppress and exploit women\u0092. 16\u0001is de\u00aenition is notable for its conceptualisation of patriarchy as extending beyond the household into wider societal structures, which inform the treatment and status of the women within them. Scholars such as Benstead and Hunnicutt note the signi\u00aecance of building upon the rich explorations of previous works such as \u0002eorising Patriarchy . Benstead argues that the multidimensionality of patriarchy, which has metamorphosed across di\u0002erent epochs, makes it particularly diYcult to explain various mechanisms sustaining gender inequality, hence the importance of re\u00afecting on previous works. 17\u0001us, Hunnicut t's theorisation of patriarchy as spanning the macro and micro levels is crucial in gaining 12 Sinenhlanhla Sithulisiwe Chisale, \u0091Patriarchy and Resistance: A Feminist Symbolic Interactionist Perspective of Highly Educated Married Black Women\u0092 (MA thesis, University of South Africa 2017), 14. 13 Reshma Sathiparsad, Myra Taylor, and Siyabonga Dlamini, \u0091Patriarchy and Family Life: Alternative Views of Male \u0005outh in Rural South Africa\u0092 (2008) 22 Agenda 76. 14 Chisale (n 12) 14. 15 Chisale (n 12) 14. 16 Sylvia Walby, \u0002eorising Patriarchy (Basil-Blackwell 1990), 20. 17 Lindsay J 221 2021 a nuanced understanding of patriarchy's functioning. 18\u0001e macro level of society encompasses \u0091bureaucracies, government, law, markets and religion and the micro level involves interactions, families, organisations, and patterned behaviours between individuals\u0092. 19 However, notwithstanding the space in which it exists, at patriarchy's core lies the inequality that exists between men and women. 20\u0001is has been systematised to such an extent that women are constricted and oppressed within the spaces they \u00aend themselves. 21 It is important to note that patriarchy is not geographically bound ; it exists in both western and African societies to varying degrees and in di\u0002erent forms. However, Tamale argues that, although pre-colonial Africa was not immune to some forms of oppression of women, the prevalence and institutionalisation of patriarchy within African societies is a consequence of colonialism. She notes that the in\u00afuence of religions that are perceived to exalt men over women have also contributed to entrenching patriarchal ideals in African societies. 22\u0001e preeminent role religion plays in most African countries necessitates a greater analysis of its relationship with patriarchy and how it impacts on the work of HRDs. 2.2.1 Patriarchy and Religion Religion has a prominent place in African societies, in\u00afuencing culture, shaping legislation, and playing a role in developing a community's ideals and values. 23 Its practice predominantly takes the form of 18 Gwen Hunnicutt, \u0091Varieties of Patriarchy and Violence against Women\u0092 (2009) 15 Violence Against Women 5. 19 ibid. 20 Walby, Valentine Moghadam (ed) Patriarchy and Development: Women's Position in the Twentieth Century (OUP 1996). 21 ibid. 22 Sylvia Tamale, \u0091Women's Sexuality as a Site of Control & Resistance: Views on the African Context\u0092 (Paper Presented at the International Conference on Bride Price Makerere University, Uganda, 16\u009618 February 2004). 23 Sylvia Tamale, \u0091Exploring the Contours of African Sexualities: Religion, Law and Power\u0092 (2014) 14 AHRLJ 152. 222 York Law Review Christianity, Islam, and, in some cases, the worship of traditional deities. Examining the existence and in\u00afuence of patriarchy in the practice of religion provides a nuanced understanding of how societal structures impact upon the rights of women. \u0001e literature discusses how this in\u00afuence is predominantly manifested in the practice of the monotheistic religions. Chisale, for example, argues that, in societies where harmful cultural practices and \u0091religious misperceptions\u0092 exist, those who challenge patriarchal powers are often put in a precarious position. 24 Van der Vyver, however, cautions against generalising religions as inherently patriarchal, noting that adherents of monotheistic religions may discount notions of a patriarchal bias or inequality within their religion. 25 Regardless of such perceptions, analysis of monotheistic Abrahamic religious practices shows an overwhelming domination of men in places of worship \u0097 as religious leaders and teachers, as well as in the organisation of religious spaces. 26 As a consequence of occupying such positions of authority, men are often a\u0002orded a monopoly in the interpretation of religious doctrines and in the practice of the religion itself. In communities where the subjugation of women exists, either as a result of colonial vestiges or cultural beliefs, those monopolising interpretation may construe religious texts in ways that become harmful to women. \u0001is, alongside challenges such as poverty, con\u00afict, discrimination, and economic inequality, compounds the disadvantaged position of women. 27\u0001e position of women in so-called religious societies often a\u0002ects the lives and work of both male and female HRDs, because they are seen as challenging the status quo. \u0001e United Nations Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women noted that WHRDs can be subjected to \u0091corrective\u0092 24 Chisale (n 12) 14. 25 Johan D van der Vyver, \u0091Religious Fundamentalism and Human Rights\u0092 (1996) 50 J Int'l A\u0002 1, 21. 26 Prickett, \u0091 Negotiating Gendered Religious Space: \u0001e Particularities of Patriarchy in an African American Mosque\u0092 (2015) 29 Gender & Society 1, 54. 27 Report submitted by the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women, \u0005akin Erturk to the 61st session of the Commission on Human Rights (E.CN.4/2005/72, 17 January 2005) para 22) citing Coomaraswamy, A/CONF.189/PC.3/5, para 2. 223 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 physical and sexual violence in an attempt to \u0091place them back\u0092 into socially constructed gender roles. 28 MHRDs who advocate for women's rights also encounter some similar challenges. \u0001ey experience physical violence, vili\u00aecation by members of their communities, and smear campaigns. 29 In some cases, their masculinity is questioned and measured through the lens of stereotyped and socially constructed notions of masculinity. 30\u0001is section has examined the e\u0002ect of patriarchal interpretations of religious texts and the practice of religion on the activities of HRDs. Attention now turns to consider other iterations of patriarchy found within international human rights law and the human rights movement. 2.2 Patriarchy within International Human Rights Law and the Human Rights Movement Before discussing the ways in which patriarchal norms and values manifest in the human rights movement, it is pertinent to understand how patriarchal norms have shaped the formation of international human rights law (IHRL) and its application at various scalar levels. In her pivotal monograph Violence against Women under International Human Rights Law , Edwards posits that IHRL \u0091privileges the realities of men's lives while marginalising those of women\u0092. 31 In making this assertion, the author highlights that it was only in the mid-1990s that rape, forced pregnancy, and other forms of gender-based violence were recognised as war crimes and crimes against humanity. 32 Drawing upon this apparent inequality in the recognition of crimes that a\u0002ect women at the international level, Edwards presents the following four criticisms of the wider system: 1) the exclusion of women in the formation of laws 28 ibid. 29 Forst, \u0091World Report on the Situation of Human Rights Defenders\u0092 (n 10) 8. 30 Editorial, Being a Man in Nigeria: Perceptions and Realities (Voices 4 Change Nigeria 2015). 31 Alice Edwards, Women Under International Human Rights Law (CUP 2011), 7. 32 ibid. 224 York Law Review and regulatory mechanisms ; 2) the marginalisation of concerns that a\u0002ect women; 3) criticism of the private and public dichotomy of international law ; and 4) the essentialisation of women's experiences. 33 Although all four criticisms touch on issues raised in this paper, the \u00aerst two criticisms are discussed in turn because of the length of this paper. \u0001e \u00aerst criticism articulated by Edwards centres on the omission of women's voices and experiences in the formation of IHRL. 34 Men have dominated politically at the international and regional levels, playing in\u00afuential roles in \u0091negotiating, developing, articulating, drafting, monitoring, implementing, and enforcing human rights norms\u0092. 35\u0001is has led to a delay in prioritising laws and policies that speci\u00aecally concern women. Although CEDAW exists at the international level, more speci\u00aec policy documents such as the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (DEVAW) does not have the binding legal authority of a convention, thus showing a lack of prioritisation of the prevalent issue of violence against women. Moreover, the state-centric focus of human rights bodies such as the United Nations (UN) and the African Union (AU) make it fundamentally diYcult for women's voices to inform the creation of laws and policies that are responsive to the challenges they encounter. 36 \u0001is is because state parties play a key role in the decision-making process, and men lead most states. \u0001is has a bearing on the substance, language, and types of laws and policies created at the regional level. 37 Edwards, drawing on Kaufman and Lindquist's Critiquing Gender Neutral Treaty Language , highlights that: 33 ibid. 34 ibid 37. 35 ibid 44. 36 Jaclyn Grace, \u0091 \u0001e Human Rights Patriarch y: Masculine Liberal Subjects and the Paradox of Universalism\u0092 (AMES 450S: Human Rights in Islam, Duke University, 29 April 2013), 6. 37 ibid. 225 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 When the interpretation of laws is undertaken by men or by women who have been socialised to accept the male elite's norms and interests as their own, women's lives within the law are constructed from a male-centred perspective. 38 \u0001e nature of such interpretations is apparent from the international level to the regional and domestic levels, where women are again typically under-represented at the decision- making table. \u0001is inadvertently leads to the unequal prioritisation of issues that speci\u00aecally a\u0002ect women, as opposed to those that a\u0002ect men. 39 Edwards's second criticism regarding the privileging of men's lives and the marginalisation of concerns that a\u0002ect women in the functioning of IHRL, as illustrated in the normative prioritisation of civil and political rights, exempli\u00aees this point. 40 Charlesworth and Chinkin posit that: Human rights law has put primacy on civil and political rights (CPR) which most times focusses on men and their relationship with the state. Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ESCR), although state responsibility, impacts more on women and their role in the private sphere. 41 Where states, at the international and domestic levels, continue to avoid legislating and enforcing both CPR and ESCR in a way that encompasses the realities of both men and women, women's rights under IHRL will continue to be excluded. As advanced by Edwards, these criticisms demonstrate the pervasiveness and multidimensionality of patriarchy. \u0001ey also sh ow how patriarchy exists not only in systems and societies that are considered oppressive but also within the formal \u0091protective spaces\u0092 that elucidate, promote, and protect universal standards of human rights. \u0001e inequality in the prioritisation of right s 38 Edwards (n 31) 46. 39 Edwards (n 31) 46. 40 Edwards (n 31) 37. 41 Hilary Charlesworth and Christine Chinkin, \u0091Gender of Jus Cogens\u0092 (1993) 15(1) HRQ 69. 226 York Law Review transcends the substance of IHRL and the problematic structuring of systems of IHRL. It may also manifest in the activities of the human rights movement in di\u0002erent ways, from the way cases are handled and issues of discrimination to the various forms of abuse women encounter within the workplace. 2.2.1 Patriarchy within the Human Rights Movement International human rights norms, policies, and practices contribute to shaping laws and practices at the regional and domestic levels. 42\u0001is means that a lack of prioritisation of women's rights at the international level can play a role in determining its prioritisation at the domestic level. Within the human rights movement, NGOs have been criticised for their approach in the implementation of some of their activities and campaigns. \u0001is includes issues of discrimination and the absence of gender and cultural sensitivity. \u0001ere have also been criticisms about the positioning of WHRDs within structured work environments, where their work is sidelined, their opinions are ignored, and they are prevented from taking up leadership positions. \u0001is paper now discusses a recent example of patriarchy within the human rights movement. In 2018, the NGO Safe Spaces published an open letter to Amnesty International Netherlands. Here, Safe Spaces raised concerns about the glamorisation and sexualisation of the experiences of refugee women of colour in Amnesty International's publications. A recent refugee campaign by Amnesty that showcased a woman \u0091posing alluringly on a bed of life jackets\u0092 prompted Safe Space to write: \u0001e simple and inconvenient fact that has been erased by Amnesty Netherlands is that many black women and women and girls of colour who constitute the majority of the world's refugees exist in contexts where their bodies do not belong to 42 Anne-Marie Slaughter and William Burke-White, \u0091 \u0001e Future of International Law Is Domestic (or the European Way of Law)\u0092 (2006) 47(2) Harv Int'l LJ 327. 227 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 them. 43 \u0001e action raised concerns about the \u0091harmful, racist and sexist portrayal of women, causing patriarchal harm and damage to women from the global south\u0092. 44 Aol\u00e1in observes that there is a lack of focus on \u0091dissecting the patriarchy inherent in international institutions\u0092 and a masculinity bias, which prioritises the lives and experiences of men, that may be inherent in the organisations and their representatives. 45\u0001e publication by Amnesty indicates how human rights organisations can be participatory in the suppression of women's rights, where a gender- sensitive lens is not adopted in the implementation of projects. Also, where the composition of organisations does not include diverse women, the portrayal of women's lives and experiences may be misrepresented or, as in the case of Amnesty Netherlands, may become \u0091harmful, racist and sexist\u0092. As Grace presciently observes, the fact that an organisation presents itself as human rights-focussed does not automatically preclude the existence of patriarchal biases. 46 Initiatives and approaches by human rights organisations geared towards dismantling patriarchy in social structures must be adopted and implemented within human rights spaces. One way in which this may be achieved is through the inclusion of more women in organisational leadership positions, as well as the adoption of a gender-sensitive lens in the initiation and implementations of projects. Furthermore, action must be taken where WHRDs are working in structured, professional organisational environments, as it is documented that women are more likely to 43 Editorial, \u0091An Open Letter to Amnesty International from NGO Safe Space\u0092 ( Media Diversi\u00aeed , 19 December 2018) <https://mediadiversi\u00aeed.org/2018/12/19/an-open- letter-to-amnesty-international-from-ngo-safe-space/> July 2020. 44 ibid. 45 Fionnuala N\u00ed Aol\u00e1in, \u0091Women, Security, and Internationalized Transitional Justice\u0092 (2009) 31(4) HRQ 1055. 46 Grace (n 36). 228 York Law Review experience indices of patriarchy than independent HRDs. 47 In a policy brief on gender, intersectionality, and security, Nah and Dwyer Smith document a number of instances where WHRDs were subjected to violence and discrimination within NGOs \u0001e authors highlight that WHRDs are abused and harassed, with their work sidelined and not given due recognition. 48\u0001ese challenges that WHRDs confront in the workplace are illustrations of Grace's contention, where she notes that the focus of human rights law on the masculine subject also exists in human rights institutions and organisations. Where these patriarchal leanings and masculinity biases within the law and practice of the human rights system are not addressed, they may become inherently discriminatory, 49 thereby reinforcing existing systems of inequality and creating temporary solutions to the challenges women face. 2.2.2 Negotiating Patriarchy: MHRDs as \u0091Gatekeepers\u0092 \u0001e literature not es an increasing presence of men around the world working either alongside or independently of women's rights organisations on gender equality matters and the elimination of violence against women. 50 In some instances, where patriarchy is prevalent in social, cultural, and political structures, the involvement of men is essential to WHRDs' activities and campaigns. Mwiine assesses the motivation for this, suggesting that involving men in the work of WHRDs can be a useful a tool in addressing resistance to issues of gender equality. 51 Researching gender equality before Uganda's parliament, Mwiine reports an interview with a women's rights activist who noted that \u0091when a man brings an issue of gender to parliamentary 47 Alice M Nah and Hannah Dwyer Smith, \u0091Gender, Intersectionality and Security\u0092 (Human Rights Defender Hub Policy Brief 6, Centre for Applied Human Rights, University of \u0005ork, 2018). 48 ibid. 49 ibid. 50 Amon Ashaba Mwiine, Ambiguities of the Narratives on \u0093Male Champions\u0094 of Gender Equality in Uganda Parliament\u0092 (2019) 33 Agenda 1. 51 ibid 110. 229 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 debate, it is taken seriously by fellow males as well as female MPs\u0092. 52 \u0001is practice of men functioning as \u0091gatekeepers\u0092 in the implementation of women's rights initiatives is arguably a manifestation of Nnaemeka's theory of \u0091nego-feminism\u0092. In her monograph, the author discusses the importance of \u0091shared values and principles of negotiations, give and take, compromise and balance in African Cultures\u0092. 53 Distinguishing western feminism from African feminism, Nnaemeka goes on to highlight that \u0091African feminism challenges through negotiation and compromise. It knows when, where and how to negotiate with or negotiate around patriarchy in di\u0002erent contexts.\u0092 54\u0001is sense of navigating around patriarchy recognises that progress will not be immediately achieved by directly challenging oppressive systems. \u0001erefore, in pursuit of the dismantling of patriarchal structures, concessions within those structures \u00aerst have to be made. However, theorisations such as Nnaemeka's that encourage compromise have been criticised, especially where such compromise places men at the forefront of women's rights initiatives. Shamim Meer cautions that in doing so \u0091men are once again in charge \u0097 only this time they are in charge of women's liberation struggles\u0092. 55 A consequent marginalisation of women's voices and the loss of their agency has also been highlighted. Mwiine suggests that this may lead to the institutionalisation of a system \u0091where men are now expected to speak on behalf of women\u0092. 56 For progress to be made, however, partnerships and concessions are often necessary. Where men take centre stage in conversations on women's rights and SGBV speci\u00aecally, it is likely going to create a vicious cycle of oppression where women's voices, experiences and contributions continue to go unheard. 52 ibid 112. 53 Obioma Nnaemeka, \u0091Nego- 377. 54 ibid 378. 55 Shamim Meer, \u0091Place of Men and Men's Organisations in the Struggle for Gender Equality\u0092 (Open Debate, 22 November 2011). 56 Mwiine (n 50) 109. 230 York Law Review 2.3 \u0091\u0001e Personal Is Political\u0092: Analysing Public/Private Patriarchy In understanding how patriarchy impacts on the work of HRDs, it is important to analyse how various aspects of patriarchy operate and intersect within the private and public sphere. Walby's explanation of private patriarchy focusses on the domestication of women by limiting their \u0091function\u0092 to household labour and the rearing of children, e\u0002ectively keeping women occupied and away from public spaces. 57 Public patriarchy is accordingly di\u0002erent because it is \u0091based on public structures other than the domestic or family space\u0092. 58 Walby goes on to di\u0002erentiate between private and public forms of patriarchy based on the \u0091relations between the structure and the institutional form of each structure\u0092 \u0097 with the former being exclusionary and latter segregationist. 59 However, the research of this paper indicates that private and public realms of patriarchy are cyclical, with di\u0002erent ends feeding into each other, as opposed to conceptualising them as mutually exclusive. \u0001is discussion looks beyond the private towards the broader consequences of patriarchy. Feminist theorists have criticised this di\u0002erentiation of patriarchy on the basis that the private or domestic does not exist in isolation of the public. 60 Drawing on the work of Okin, Romany argues that the \u0091public/private dichotomy ignores the political character of power unequally distributed in family life, [which] obscures the political nature of private life\u0092. 61 One implication of the political nature of the private sphere is that states con\u00aegure it in such a way that perpetuates and maintains the subjugation of women. \u0001is can be done through the absence of legislation that protects women against various forms of violence and/or discriminatory laws and policies, 57 Walby, \u0002eorising Patriarchy (n 16) 178. 58 Walby, \u0002eorising Patriarchy (n 16). 59 Walby, \u0002eorising Patriarchy (n 16). 60 Susan M Okin, Justice, Gender and Family (Basic Books 1989); Celina Romany, \u0091Women as Aliens: A Feminist Critique of the Public/Private Distinction in International Human Rights Law\u0092 (1993) 6 Harv Hum Rts J 8 ; Edwards (n 31). 61 Romany (n 60) 100. 231 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 which restrict women's participation in work life. \u0001is has the capacity to aYrm and reinforce male domination in the private sphere, regardless of its detriments to the lives of women within them. Romany, for example, suggests that \u0091the family remains a sanctuary of privacy into which one can retreat to avoid state regulation. As long as the family remains the consolidating unit of male hierarchy, the state can remain neutral towards it\u0092. 62 In discussing the public\u0096private divide in the interpretation of human rights, Lajoie notes that \u0091rights violations that take place in the \u0093private sphere\u0094 are not traditionally addressed in human rights discourse as they are viewed as outside of the realm of state accountability\u0092. 63\u0001e creation of IHRL is a public endeavour and consequently seen as largely controlled by men. 64 Grace observes that \u0091international law-making institutions have always been, and continue to be, dominated by men, while international human rights law has developed to re\u00afect the experiences of men and largely to exclude those of women\u0092. 65\u0001erefore, where the international regime does not prioritise \u0091private issues\u0092, which disproportionately a\u0002ect women, states may take advantage of legislative and regulatory gaps to reinforce patriarchal culture or traditions. 66 3Setting the Context Attention now turns to consider the wider context of the human rights defender paradigm and concomitant state obligations at the international and regional levels. Following this, an analysis of Nigeria's political and legal system and its human rights situation is provided in order to contextualise the legal realities within which Nigerian HRDs operate. \u0001e section concludes by discussing a number 62 Romany (n 60) 104. 63 Amie Lajoie, \u0091 Challenging Assumptions of Vulnerability: \u0001e Signi\u00aecance in the Work, Lives and Identities of Women Human Rights Defenders\u0092 (PhD thesis, National University of Ireland Galway 2018), 10. 64 Grace (n 36) 6. 65 Grace (n 36). 66 Hilary Charlesworth and Christine Chinkin, \u0002e Boundaries of International Law: A Feminist Analysis (Manchester UP 2000), 57. 232 York Law Review of Nigeria's laws, policies, and practices that directly in\u00afuence the work of HRDs and ultimately considers whether the state has complied with its obligations to create an enabling environment for HRDs. 3.1 \u0001e Human Rights Defender Paradigm \u0001roughout history, individuals and groups have promoted equality, human rights, and social justice. From the anti-slavery movement to the struggle against colonialism and the recognition of women's rights as human rights, the importance of courageous people challenging \u0091accepted norms\u0092 and confronting systems of injustice cannot be overemphasised. \u0001e UN 's 1998 Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 67 (hereafter the Declaration on HRDs) formally recognises the role of individuals and groups as critical stakeholders in the promotion and protection of human rights. 68 Whilst non-binding in its nature, the Declaration on HRDs draws upon rights and obligations enshrined in legally binding instruments such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (AfCHPR). 69\u0001e central tenets of the Declaration on HRDs are translated at the regional level through declarations and resolutions such as the Grand Bay Declaration and Plan of Action, the Kigali Declaration, and the 67\u0001e declaration was adopted by consensus by the UN General Assembly exemplifying the state's commitment to its implementation. 68 Luis Enrique Eguren Fern\u00e1ndez, and Champa Patel, \u0091Towards Developing a Critical and Ethical Approach for Better Recognising and Protecting Human Rights Defenders\u0092 (2015) 19(7) IJHR 896, 897. 69 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (adopted 16 December 1966, entered into force 23 March 1976) 999 UNTS 171 (ICCPR); International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (adopted 16 December 1966, UNTS 993); African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (adopted 27 June 1981, entered into force 21 October 1986) (1982) 21 ILM 58 (AfCHPR). 233 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 Resolution on the Protection of Human Rights Defenders in Africa, among others. 70\u0001ese mechanisms also enjoin African state s to take appropriate measures to adopt the Declaration's provisions and provide an environment conducive to HRDs carrying out their activities. 3.2 Nigeria as a Case Study Nigeria is a country of more than 193 million people, comprising over 200 ethnic groups spread across 36 states. 71 Its historic and contemporary heterogeneity, which has intermittently led to political crises and ethnic strife, rendered federalism a suitable political model after colonialism. 72 Nigeria operates a pluralist legal system, with statutory law coexisting with Shariah law (Islamic law) in the north and customary law in both the north and south. 73 With regard to the transposition of international and regional treaties, the country's dualist nature requires domestication by Acts of the National Assembly before such Acts can have national e\u0002ect. 74 Laws enacted federally become applicable at the state level when domesticated by respective state Houses of Assembly. \u0001is legislative process has led to uneven progress across states, especially in respect of laws and policies on human rights and women's rights. \u0001is is further complicated by the in\u00afuence of 70 Grand Bay (Mauritius) Declaration and Plan of Action 1999, para 19 <https://www.achpr.org/legalinstruments/detail?id=44> acces sed 23 July 2020; Kigali Declaration 2003, para 28 <https://www.achpr.org/legalinstruments/detail?id=39> accessed 22 July 2020; Resolution 69 (XXXV) 04 on the Protection of Human Rights Defenders in Africa; Resolution 119 (XXXXI I) 07 on the Situation of Human Rights Defenders in Africa; Resolution 196 (L) 11 on Human Rights Defenders in Africa. 71 National Bureau of Statistics, \u00912017 Demographic Statistics Bulletin\u0092 (May 2018), 12; William O Mbamalu, \u0091Revisiting Shari'ah, Democracy and Human Rights in Nigeria\u0092 (2012) 46(2) In die Skri\u00afig/In Luce Verbi 1. 72 Said Adejumobi, \u0091Civil Society and Federalism in Nigeria\u0092 (2004) 4(2) Regional & Federal Studies 214. 73 ibid. 74 ibid. 234 York Law Review religion and culture on the type of laws enacted and prioritised by states. 75 Nigeria has had a complex relationship with human rights. Whilst the country has rati\u00aeed all nine core human rights treaties, the protection and prioritisation of human rights at the national level has not received as much attention. 76\u0001e introductory section of this paper explain ed that SGBV is one of the major challenges women and girls confront in Nigeria. \u0001e inadequacy of judicial, executive, and legislative mechanisms in curbing its prevalence is primarily rooted in the inequality that exists between men and women. Both institutionally and socially, women's rights have not been prioritised, leading to an absence of \u0091gender equality mainstreaming\u0092 in the enforcement and application of laws and policies. 77\u0001ese challenges are further magni\u00aeed by patriarchal interpretations of religious texts that are prevalent in both the northern and southern parts of Nigeria. In an attempt to protect victims of abuse, in 2015 the National Assembly passed the Violence Against Persons (Prohibitions) Act (VAPP Act). 78 Whilst the Act does not address the issue of gender inequality caused by patriarchy, it remains a signi\u00aecant piece of legislation due to its prioritisation of SGBV. It does this by providing a broad de\u00aenition for rape, expanding acts that constitute SGBV, and increasing the punishment for various forms of SGBV, among other salient provisions. 79 Despite the importance of the Act in protecting the rights of women, the VAPP Act 75 Rebecca Zahn, \u0091Human Rights in the Plural Legal System of Nigeria\u0092 (2009) 1 Edin Student LR 66, 83. 76 United Nations OYce of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, \u0091Status of Rati\u00aecation\u0092 <https://indicators.ohchr.org/> accessed 30 June 2020; Nlerum S Okogbule, \u0091Access to Justice and Human Rights Protection in Nigeria: Problems and Prospect\u0092 (2005) 3(2) SURIJHR 95. 2013) <https://www.pambazuka.org/gender- minorities/contextualizing-gender-based-violence-within-patriarchy-nigeria> accessed 20 April 2020. 78 Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act 2015 (VAPP Act). 79 ibid. 235 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 has not been consistently domesticated across the country. Since the Act's enactment in 2015, only 15 out of the 36 states in the country have domesticated the VAPP. 80 Of those states yet to domesticate its provisions, over half are located in the northern states. 81 Possible explanations for states' reluctance are put forward in the literature. \u0001e World Bank, for example, notes that \u0091the main barriers to the domestication of [this law] are resistance based on entrenched norms of gender inequity and opposition to concepts around equality and rights that are perceived as foreign\u0092. 82 Some states become reluctant to domesticate laws that promote equality and the protection of women where it is thought that such laws are against cultural and religious beliefs. 83 Interestingly, states' reluctance to domesticate what are perceived as \u0091foreign norms or beliefs\u0092 is only raised when the issue of women's rights and protection arises. 3.3 National Laws, Policies, and Practices International and regional mechanisms outlining the nature of states' obligations to HRDs, including the Declaration on HRDs, have not been implemented in any meaningful way in Nigeria. 84\u0001e enj oyment of rights to freedom of assembly, association, and expression \u0097 some of the key rights underpinning the work of HRDs \u0097 are illustrative of this. \u0001ese rights are nominally protected by central legal mechanisms of Nigeria.

Although quali\u00aeed in their nature, in some instances pieces of local legislation in Nigeria have been used to curtail these rights. 86 Freedom of assembly, for example, is regulated by the Public Order Act, which requires individuals or groups to request a permit before they can carry out protests. 87\u0001e permit is usually issued by the police force, meaning that the process is often vulnerable to abuse. \u0001e discretion given to the police may lead to the arbitrary use of power and the infringement of people's fundamental human rights in Nigeria. In the everyday work of HRDs, this may manifest in the following ways. When a protest is taking place, state actors opposed to the protest may give directives for the protests to be disrupted. HRDs use protests as a tool to challenge government policies, protection gaps, and the infringement of people's rights. \u0001erefore, the disruption of their activities contributes to the shrinking of the civic space and prevents them from holding government oYcials accountable. \u0001e role of HRDs and NGOs in challenging oppressive government systems/policies is important because of their critical function of stepping into protection gaps created by the state's inaction. Non-state actors are therefore actively participating in monitoring, advocating, and bringing more attention to human rights issues more broadly. With regard to continued e\u0002orts to eradicate SGBV, organisations have created shelters and provided legal, medical, and psychosocial support to victims. 88\u0001ese organisations have also participated in advocating for more progressive laws against SGBV and the strengthening of institutional support, by organising protests, educational initiatives, and 85 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) 1999, s 39\u0096 40; AfCHPR, arts 9(2), 10\u009611. 86\u0001is means they can be restricted on the grounds of public order, health, security, and the rights of others. 87 Public Order Act 1979, sch 1(2). 88\u0001e World Bank (n 82). 237 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 legislative and social media campaigns. 89 However, it has also placed them at the receiving end of some backlash from both state and non- state actors. Whilst there are no speci\u00aec laws criminalising HRD advocacy on SGBV, actors of the state play a role in restricting activities such as protests, or in\u00aficting physical harm on protesters. 90 HRDs are also met with vitriol from wider community members such as religious actors and institutions that believe HRDs are acting against the prevailing religion or culture. Whilst preceding sections have outlined the theoretical basis for this paper, it is pertinent at this point to contextualise these discussions through examination of the experiences of HRDs working on SGBV initiatives in Nigeria collected through primary research. 4Experiences of HRDs Working on SGBV Initiatives in Nigeria Grounded in engagement with the literature, this section thematically analyses data gathered through extensive qualitative research. Chief among the conclusions drawn from the research are the constraints on the activities of HRDs motivated by cultural and religious fundamentalism in shaping societal perceptions on SGBV, and the creation of oppressive institutions. As discussed in previous sections, regardless of the challenges patriarchy presents, HRDs working on these issues have made some progress in the form of policy and legal reform, education, and the provision of services and support for victims of SGBV. 91 Also, the approach of HRDs in navigating and negotiating patriarchy in the course of their work will be analysed. 89 Corlett Letjolane, Connie Nawaigo, and Andrea Rocca, \u0091Nigeria: Defending Human Rights: Not Everywhere, Not Every Right\u0092 (2010) International Fact-Finding Mission, 25. 90 ibid. 91 Onyemelukwe, \u0091Legislation of Violence Against Women\u0092 (n 6). 238 York Law Review 4.1 \u0001e Constraints Presented by Cultural and Religious Fundamentalism Culture is often understood as a value system, a way of living and thinking shared by people in a particular society or community. 92 Ssenyonjo notes that African societies are considered \u0091traditional\u0092, and as holding sets of values and beliefs separate from western cultures. 93 \u0001e signi\u00aecance of cultural values is enshrined and illustrated in Arti cle 29(1) of the AfCHPR, which underscores the importance of preserving: Positive African cultural values in [the] relationship with other member states in the spirit of tolerance, dialogue and consultation and to contribute to the promotion of the moral wellbeing of society. 94 Previous discussions have sought to highlight how the construction and interpretation of culture and religions can be male-centric and largely patriarchal. 95\u0001is perception was re\u00afected in the responses of research participants. Sani Muhammad, a MHRD, explained how the perception that men have to be strong and tough, perpetuated by cultural norms that traditionally position men as superior, is one factor contributing to the prevalence of SGBV in Nigeria. \u0001is can be exacerbated by the misinterpretation of Quranic provisions in di\u0002erent parts of Nigeria, which enjoin men to \u0091protect and maintain women\u0092. 96 Muhammad's point strongly re\u00afects a central tenet of feminist scholarship, which emphasises the socially constructed nature of patriarchy, informed by the male-centric hierarchies that exist within the family, in 92 Manisuli Ssenyonjo, \u0091Culture and the Human Rights of Women in Africa: Between Light and Shadow\u0092 (2007) 51(1) JAL 39, 50. 93 ibid 51. 94 Article 29(1), African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (adopted 27 June 1981, art 29(1) (entered into force 21 October 1986). 95 Hunnicutt (n 18). 96 Interview with Sani Muhammad, Executive Director, Bridge Connect (Zoom, 6 July 2020). 239 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 communities, and even within the workspace. 97\u0001ese manifestations of patriarchy sustain an environment where violence against women is normalised. Sani Muhammad's responses were again instructive as they demonstrated that the patriarchal nature of Nigerian society results in \u0091toxic cultural and religious practices that undermine the position of women\u0092. 98\u0001is often extends to the creation and application of laws. It is important to note, however, that other participants observed that religion and culture are not inherently destructive and do not legitimise SGBV. What exists are men who bene\u00aet from a system of patriarchy, thus construing religion and culture in a way that only bene\u00aets them. 99 \u0001is perspective is re\u00afective of van der Vyver's caution against the generalisation of the perception that religions are inherently patriarchal. 100 \u0001e interview process also demonstrated how culture and religion operate on a spectrum in the realities of everyday life, serving to simultaneously inspire and curtail the activities of HRDs. At one end of the spectrum, some of the participants declared that their religious and cultural background inspired their activism and their desire to advocate for and \u0091protect\u0092 women from SGBV. 101 At the other end, the religious practices of some communities and the ways in which beliefs have been institutionalised serve to constrain the activities of HRDs. In some cases, the actions of religious leaders appear to have motivated forms of assault against HRDs working on SGBV initiatives. One participant recounted: 97 ibid. 98 ibid. 99ibid; interview with Anonymous Participant A (WhatsApp Call, 27 June 2020). 100 Van der Vyver (n 25). 101 Interview with Sani Muhamma d (n 96); interview with Anonymous Participant A (n 99); interview with Anonymous Participant B (Zoom, 5 July 2020). 240 York Law Review I received 17\u009619 death threats in an hour when an Islamic cleric went to the mosque and said I was making girls protest \u0097 it was just a protest against rape. 102 \u0001e participant 's description of the reaction of the men in the mosque indicates anger and fear of women clamouring for their right and safety. \u0001e in\u00afuence of religious leaders in shaping perceptions illustrates the \u00afuidity of patriarchy within all facets of society, echoing the discussions in the literature of how patriarchy manifests in both the public and the private sphere, with both institutions coalescing in the oppression of women. In some conservative northern states, the entrenchment of cultural and religious ideals at an institutional level, in the form of laws and judicial decisions, has resulted in a lack of progress on cases of SGBV. 103 Campaigns such as the #ArewaMeToo movement have sought to address this absence of political will to engage with SGBV and the continuous rise in cases. 104 Predominantly led by WHRDs, the movement seeks to advocate for the rights of victims of SGBV and push state legislators to domesticate the VAPP Act in northern Nigeria. Although #ArewaMeToo was not well received by some groups, its initiation prompted a wave of protests that spread across the region. 105 In one of the more conservative states in the north, the sultan of Sokoto issued a statement banning the movement and all its activities. 106 One of the prominent leaders and co-convenor of the movement, Fakhrriyyah Hashim, a WHRD, received backlash for her work on the movement, which ranged from death threats to intense trolling and harassment on the internet. Recounting one of her experiences, she explained: 102 Interview with Sani Muhammad (n 96). 103\u0001e World Bank (n 82). 104 \u0091Arewa\u0092 is used to describe the northern part of Nigeria. 105 Hashim (n 6). 106 John Campbell, \u0091Nigeria's Sultan of Sokoto Bans #MeToo Movement\u0092 ( Council on Foreign Relations , 10 December 2019) <https://www.cfr.org/blog/nigerias-sultan- sokoto-bans-metoo-movement> accessed 20 August 2020. 241 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 My colleague and I were invited to speak on consent at a University, but this was interpreted [by some student groups] as us speaking on westernised conceptions of SGBV, they said our activities were in\u00afuenced by an LGBTQ agenda, that we were there to destroy their social fabric, to desecrate their traditional and cultural values. \u0001is led to death threats, they said: \u0091when you come, you are not going to leave this place intact\u0092. \u0001e event was eventually cancelled. Fakhrriyyah's experiences with the student group and the response of the sultan of Sokoto, combined with the previous example of the Islamic cleric's sermon triggering death threats to an HRD, illustrate the extent to which beliefs, which are normatively personal, are brought into public space s. \u0001is is arguably done with the purpose of controlling the actions of women and sti\u00afing voices that speak in their defence. \u0001is example demonstrates how religious actors in Nigeria often take advantage of the apathy of state actors towards the issue of SGBV, thereby taking advantage of the gaps in the legislation to impose their beliefs on people, state structures, and institutions. Moreover, these empirical examples suggest an intentionality by the male-dominated state in maintaining the status quo of violence and oppression through the entrenchment of culture and religion at institutional levels. 4.1.1 \u0091\u0001ey Were Supposed to Protect Us\u0092: Impact of Cultural and Religious Fundamentalism on Attitudes and Approaches of State Actors During the preparation for one of our rallies I had an encounter with a police oYcer regarding getting a permit for the rally. He said to me, \u0091rape has been going on for a long time and you think your advocacy can change anything? If a person is beating you, you do not beat them back, you beg them to stop\u0092. After refusing to give me the permit, he asked 242 York Law Review if I could meet him in a hotel. 107 Reported by a participant in the research, this interaction with a police oYcer o\u0002ers one illustration of the nature of daily interactions of Nigerian women, with the representatives of public institutions and services. As previously highlighted, permission to conduct protests is a process that can be open to misuse \u0097 ordinarily, requests for permits to conduct a protest should be assessed on the possibilities of leading to public disorder or destruction. 108 As reported by a research participant, this empirical example demonstrates how the transference of personal biases can lead to the demeaning of the WHRD and her work. It also indicates how cultural sentiments, grounded in patriarchal hegemony, are imposed in the execution of a public role. Such interactions often lead to the restriction of the fundamental rights and freedoms of HRDs by outrightly preventing protests, discouraging protests, and in\u00aficting harm on HRDs. In addition, the participants' responses indicate that the activities of WHRDs are being socially perceived as \u0091a transgression to established norms\u0092, 109 and a disruptive representation of a gender often expected to be docile, homely, and domesticated. Although, in the course of conducting protests and the implementation of their activities, HRDs may experience some form of harassment, the interview process showed that the experiences of MHRDs and WHRDs di\u0002ered. Whilst Sani Muhammad's activism was questioned by religious leaders, Participant A's interactions with the police, an institution charged with the protection of society, were ultimately reduced to the sexualisation of the participant's body. \u0001is comparison exempli\u00aees one consequence of patriarchal societies \u0097 the actions or activities of women are undermined by suggestions (by both state and non-state actors) that their place in society is not to challenge or 107 Interview with Anonymous Participant A (n 99). 108 Public Order Act 1979, sch 1(2). 109 Philomina E Okeke-Ihejirika, \u0091Asserting Agency and Negotiating Patriarchy: Nigerian Women's Experiences\u0092 (2017) 34 J Global South Stud 1. 243 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 question oppressive systems but to be con\u00aened in traditional spaces where they ful\u00ael sexual obligations, rear children, and tend to their families. \u0001e experiences of these HRDs indicate a seamless relationship between both forms of patriarchy, re\u00afecting Uberoi's contention that the private mirrors the public and that both spheres are ultimately governed by the same patriarchal principles. 110\u0001erefore, the creation of an enabling and e\u0002ective environment for HRDs goes beyond the creation of laws and policies that make this possible. It particularly requires taking a few steps back to reorient communities and people who enforce and implement laws about harmful cultural and religious perceptions, which impacts on their work and the rights of individuals. 4.2 \u0091\u0001e Compromises We Make\u0092: Navigating Patriarchy and Making an Impact Previous discussions have sought to highlight some of the structural impediments that render Nigeria a challenging environment for the implementation of women's rights initiatives. Initiatives against SGBV have been met with opposition emanating from the legislative and executive branches of governance. One possible reason for this persisting recalcitrance is the absence of women in positions of power and authority. In the National Assembly, for instance, women occupy just seven of 109 seats in the Senate and 11 out of 360 seats in the House of Representatives. 111 When combined with the country's deep-seated culture and religiosity, the disproportionate nature of representation at the highest levels of governance has frustrated e\u0002orts to create and 110 Patricia Uberoi, \u0091Feminism and the Public-Private Distinction\u0092 in Gurpreet Mahajan (ed) \u0002e Public and the Private: Issues of Democratic Citizenship (SAGE Publications India 2003) 3. 111 Editorial, \u0091Nigerian Women in National Assembly and the Geo Bill: Matters Arising\u0092 ( EIE Nigeria , 26 July 2019) <https://www.shineyoureye.org/blog/nigerian- women-in-national-assembly-and-the-geo-bill-matters-arising> accessed 24 August 2020. 244 York Law Review implement laws that take action against SGBV. One research participant, Busola Odubela, observed the paradoxical nature of this, remarking that \u0091the bene\u00aeciaries of patriarchy will not create institutional structures against SGBV\u0092. 112 Resistance to facilitating women's access to political positions may be interpreted as a way of controlling the access of women into the public sphere. \u0001is consequently leads to the lack of prioritisation of issues a\u0002ecting women, such as SGBV. \u0001ese challenges limited the creation of laws against SGBV, to the extent that, even when laws are proposed, such laws take a long time before they are passed at the federal level and even longer at the state level. 4.2.1 Road to the VAPP Act \u0001e absence of women in legislative positions meant that f or a long time the laws that existed did not provide suYcient protection for women. Prior to the adoption of the VAPP Act, the key pieces of legislation governing issues of rape and other forms of abuse were the Penal Code Act and Criminal Code Act (applicable in northern and southern Nigeria, respectively). \u0001ese pieces of legislation are problematic, formalising restrictive interpretations of what constitutes rape. In some cases, the Acts permit the abuse of women, 113 and outline less stringent punishments for SGBV o\u0002ences than for other criminal o\u0002ences. 114 In discussing reasons for the lack of progress in developing laws against SGBV, one interview participant noted that \u0091men cannot legislate on what they are not aware of\u0092. 115\u0001is interpretation broadly a ligns with Kaufman and Lindquist's writings on male-centred construction and 112 Interview with Busola Odubela, journalist for Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (Google Meet, 20 June 2020). 113 Onyemelukwe, \u0091How Well Does the Law Protect Women at Home?\u0092 (n 83). 114 Onyemelukwe, \u0091How Well Does the Law Protect Women at Home?\u0092 (n 83); Penal Code Act, No 25 of 1960, s 55(1); Criminal Code Act [Nigeria], Cap C38 LFN 2004, 1 June 1916, s 353. 115 Interview with Busola Odubela, journalist for Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (n 112). 245 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 interpretation of law. 116 However, drawing on the \u00aendings of this research, this paper argues that the insensibility of legislators towards SGBV is not the product of ignorance but rather a deliberate ploy to evade state accountability. As previous sections have sought to demonstrate, patriarchal control is multidimensional. 117 A refusal to legislate on issues that a\u0002ect women enables men to act with impunity both within the private and public sphere. \u0001e eventual legislative prioritisation of the VAPP Act came about following more than a decade of advocacy, lobbying, and negotiation by women's rights groups. \u0001e Act was intended to address both the shortcomings of the laws and the lacklustre attitude of legislators. 118 \u0001e Legislative Advocacy Coalition on Violence against Women (LOCVAW) took a prominent role in this process, notably initiating the bill's drafting in 2002. Whilst hailed as a moment of progression, the Act itself was s haped by a number of compromises. \u0001is was discussed in some of the interviews. Osai Ojigho indicated that one such compromise was its very name. 119\u0001e LOCVAW initially proposed the \u0091Violence against Women Bill\u0092, which was rejected by the legislators. 120 Ojigho described in the interview how the present name was eventually chosen to re\u00afect a more \u0091gender-neutral\u0092 legislation. 121 \u0001e earliest phases of the VAPP were also marked by other tensions such as the inclusion of marital rape. 122 At its broadest level, the story 116 Edwards (n 31) 46. 117 Benstead (n 17). 118 Onyemelukwe, \u0091How Well Does the Law Protect Women at Home?\u0092 (n 83). 119 Interview with Osai Ojigho, country director, Amnesty International Nigeria (Google Meet, 23 June 2020). 120 Onyemelukwe, \u0091Legislation of Violence Against Women\u0092 (n 6). \u0001e name of the Act was changed by legislators to the \u0091Violence (Prohibition) Bill\u0092 in 2003 on the basis that \u0091not only women experience violence\u0092. 121 Onyemelukwe, \u0091Legislation of Violence Against Women\u0092 (n 6). 122\u0001is, however, did not make it to the \u00aenal Act, passed in 2015. Interview with Osai Ojigho (n 119). 246 York Law Review of the VAPP Act serves to exemplify many of the fundamental challenges that HRDs working in Nigeria confront, such as the absence of enabling laws and the political will of legislatures. \u0001e VAPP Act also brings to the fore the criticisms by Edwards regarding the exclusion of women in the formation of laws and regulatory mechanisms, which similarly exist at the domestic level. 123\u0001is is illustrated in the case of the National Assembly, which is the central law-making body of Nigeria, and the creation of the VAPP Act and other laws on women's rights, thus reaYrming the pervasive nature of patriarchy and how it creates obstacles from the international to the domestic level. 4.3 Navigating Patriarchy through \u0091Allies\u0092 \u0091Allies are necessary, but the \u00aeght is ours.\u0092 124 When interview participants were asked about the role of men in their initiatives against SGBV, all ten participants reiterated the importance of male allies in advocating and implementing activities against SGBV. One interview participant went as far as asserting that \u0091we need men to penetrate patriarchal systems\u0092. 125\u0001is response demonstrates the reality of women's rights advocacy in Nigeria, that campaigns and strategies do not usually make much headway when women are solely at the forefront of activities. As the VAPP's advocacy journey shows, the prioritisation of some Acts usually takes years of activism, strategic negotiation and liaising with stakeholders within and outside the governance structure. It is, however, important to note that the negotiations and navigation that have been shown to be crucial to successful activism are not limited to legislative advocacy. Such negotiations necessarily require the embryonic implementation of initiatives at the communal level, in interactions with religious leaders, 123 Edwards (n 31) 7. 124 Interview with Khadijah EL-Usman, lawyer (Zoom, 24 June 2020). 125 Interview with Anonymous Participant B (n 101). 247 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 and even within the human rights and development network. Fakhrriyyah Hashim observes that in legislative or communal advocacies \u0091the presence of men often give[s] activities legitimacy\u0092. 126 For interview participant B, the successful domestication of the VAPP Act in Bauchi State could be credited to strong male \u0091allyship\u0092. 127\u0001is participant also noted that one of the reasons this was possible was because of the intense social advocacy/campaigns conducted across northern states. \u0001ese campaigns led to the creation of important allies within the government. 128 However, whilst the signi\u00aecance of the allyship of MHRDs cannot be discounted, it is crucial to note that their involvement sometimes results in women being ignored or sidelined in the course of their work against SGBV. One female participant explained: Sometimes when we go for outreach visits in schools to teach young children about consent, the boys do not listen to me when I speak, but when my male colleague says exactly what I said, they respond. 129 Interactions with research participants have shown that the inclusion of men is necessary in the \u00aeght against SGBV. As Sani Muhammad observes, \u0091the quest to dismantle patriarchy is not a women's rights issue, it is a human rights issue\u0092. 130 Nonetheless, there must be sustained awareness of any detrimental consequences this may impart. \u0001e involvement of men in facilitating access into traditionally male- dominated spaces should be undertaken in a way that prioritises the agency of women and makes clear their pivotal role in championing these causes. 126 Interview with Fakhrriyyah Hashim (Zoom, 6 July 2020). 127 Interview with Anonymous Participant B (n 101). 128 Interview with Anonymous Participant B (n 101). 129 Interview with Anonymous Participant A (n 99). 130 Interview with Sani Muhammad (n 96). 248 York Law Review \u0001e negotiation of patriarchy, which the empirical research has shown unfolds through methods such as the use of allies, compromising on needs, or political leveraging on the power of votes, indicates a practical illustration of Nnaemeka's nego-feminism. 131 Although this theory typi\u00aees what is needed to make progress in a patriarchal African society, it simultaneously reinforces and solidi\u00aees patriarchal structures. When the default response to patriarchal oppression is always negotiation, it is unlikely going to create real, sustainable change. Such negotiations may create a reoccurring cycle where HRDs have to continuously yield to the demands of patriarchy. 5Conclusion \u0001is paper has sought to advance understanding of the in\u00afuence of patriarchy on the activities of HRDs working on SGBV initiatives in Nigeria. \u0001is research does not suggest that the experiences of HRDs, and WHRDs in particular, are monolithic, however, instead observing similarities in the experiences of those people working on SGBV initiatives in Nigeria. In doing so, the paper has presented an interdisciplinary analysis of various iterations of patriarchy, which in turn formed the theoretical basis for the empirical research. \u0001e discussion on patriarchy brought into focus its multidimensional \u00afuidity within various sectors of society. While noting the presence of laws and policies for the protection of HRDs, this paper has noted how the male-centric human rights sphere does a disservice to women and HRDs working on women's rights issues. Underpinned by the responses of research participants and the submissions in the literature review, this paper has found that patriarchy indeed plays a critical role in shaping the activities of HRDs. \u0001e pre -eminence of culture and religion, which are mostly patriarchal or interpreted within patriarchal boundaries, has in\u00afuenced the ability of HRDs to push for legislation that can hold perpetrators accountable and carry out initiatives in support of victims. 131 Nnaemeka (n 53) 377\u009678. 249 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 \u0001is plays out in their interactions with both state and non -state actors. \u0001e analyses further suggest that , for HRDs to make progress with their initiatives against SGBV, they have to \u00aend ways to navigate patriarchy either with the use of male allies to in\u00aeltrate patriarchal spaces or through conceding certain patriarchal demands, albeit not those that compromise the core of their work. \u0001e importance of providing an enabling and protected environment for HRDs to work safely is a budding area of human rights law and practice globally. Within the Nigerian context, it is an area with very sparse research and one that policymaker s have not legislated upon. \u0001e recognition of the work of activists, NGO sta\u0002, and other human rights actors as HRDs may be a vital step in creating an institutional framework that prioritises the rights of HRDs and their ability to make an impact. Mechanisms Used to Translate the International Prohibition on Child Recruitment to Armed Non-State Actors in \u0001e Democratic R epublic of Congo Ella Allen Abstract Armed con\u00afict in the twenty-\u00aerst century is largely characterised by armed non-state actors (ANSAs), a phenomenon that is not re\u00afected in international legal provisions. ANSAs generally have little regard for international law, as demonstrated by their continuous indi\u0002erence towards humanitarian norms. \u0001ey are the most proli\u00aec recruiters of child soldiers globally, with ANSAs operating within the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) being some of the most proli\u00aec o\u0002enders. \u0001is paper provides a fresh analysis of the suitability of the mechanisms utilised by national and international actors to translate the prohibition of child recruitment from international law to ANSAs in the DRC. \u0001is was achieved by conducting empirical research in the DRC to understand the intricacies of the voluntary and coercive mechanisms being utilised, comprising ten interviews with NGO employees involved with the DRC . \u0001is research highlights three mechanisms of voluntary compliance used by both local and international NGOs, as well as one coercive compliance mechanism, prosecution by the International Criminal Court. \u0001is paper identi\u00aees a myriad of factors speci\u00aec to the DRC that inhibit e\u0002orts to translate the prohibition on child recruitment. It then argues for the systemic reinforcement of the prohibition through the application of a variety of mechanisms in order to support norm di\u0002usion and eventual norm internalisation. 251 Volume \u0001 \u0097 1Introduction Hottinger contends that \u0091there is no discussion: whether we like it or not, today NSAs [Non-State Actors] are the main feature of violent con\u00aficts both within States and at a regional level\u0092. 1\u0001e international legal instruments that govern armed con\u00afict, however, remain inherently state-centric, being mostly designed, rati\u00aeed, and implemented by state actors.

As the prohibition of the use of child soldiers exists at an international legal level, this paper will investigate the process by which this norm is di\u0003used into the domestic context. It will employ Finnemore and Sikkink's concept of international norm dynamics, which posits that \u0091norm entrepreneurs\u0092 \u0097 those interested in changing social \u0097 attempt to \u0091socialize\u0092 ANSAs into becoming \u0091norm followers\u0092. 13 Norm entrepreneurs, often local, national, or international human rights NGOs, are the \u0091driving force for the emergence of new norms\u0092, calling attention to issues and attempting to persuade a mass of individuals to accept the prohibition of child recruitment. 14 Once norm entrepreneurs have promoted the norm and framed it in a way that the public is receptive of, the norm \u0091cascades 12 Child Soldiers International, \u0091Child Soldier Levels Doubled Since 2012 and Girls' Exploitation is Rising\u0092( ReliefWeb , 11 February 2019) <https://reliefweb.int/report/world/child-soldier-levels-doubled-2012-and-girls- exploitation-rising> accessed 20 September 2020. 13 Cass R Sustein, \u0091Social Norms and Social Roles\u0092 (1996) 96 Colum L Rev 903, 909; Martha Finnemore and Kathryn Sikkink, \u0091International Norm Dynamics and Political Change\u0092 (1998) 52 INTL ORG 887, 895. 14 Finnemore and Sikkink (n 13) 897; M\u00fcller Harald and Carmen Wunderlich, Norm Dynamics in Multilateral Arms Control: Interests, Con\u00aficts, and Justice (University of Georgia Press 2013) 25. 254 York Law Review through the rest of the population\u0092. 15 As a result of this process, \u0091norm internalization\u0092 may occur, meaning that the prohibition of child recruitment \u0091acquires a taken-for-granted quality and is no longer a matter of broad public debate\u0092. 16 Mechanisms utilised by \u0091norm entrepreneurs\u0092 within the DRC will therefore be evaluated in order to understand the extent to which they support or fail to support the di\u0003usion of the norm. \u0001is paper divides its understanding of translation mechanisms used by norm entrepreneurs into two categories: voluntary and coercive. A voluntary compliance mechanism is a technique where ANSAs freely engage with actors, with the aim of facilitating translation of the norm. A coercive translation mechanism is a technique utilised to induce or force compliance by ANSAs. \u0001is study combines both desk -based and empirical qualitative research carried out between May and October 2020. It reports the \u00aendings of ten interviews with research participants. Nine of these interviews involved local NGOs and aimed to reveal the nuances of the translation mechanisms employed, their local application, and their perceived e\u0003ectiveness. 17 A further interview was conducted with an employee of Geneva Call, with a view to understanding the role of i nternational NGOs (INGOs) in this area. \u0001is interview data was supplemented by a survey of local NGOs operating in the DRC, which received 17 completed responses. \u0001e pape r commences by analysing three voluntary mechanisms identi\u00aeed within the empirical data. \u0001ese are: ad hoc negotiations ; unilateral declarations ; and the education and training of ANSAs.

Summary \u0001is study found that ad hoc agreements are usually made between an ANSA and another entity (eg a local NGO) to encourage compliance with a humanitarian norm. Ad hoc arrangements to release child soldiers was the most commonly identi\u00aeed mechanism to be used by the local NGO research participants. \u0001ese arrangements directly support the translation of the prohibition on child recruitment by securing the release of children from an ANSA\u0092s control as well as often trying to dissuade the ANSA from recruiting further. Participant responses suggest that organisations usually follow a similar process in negot iating the release of child soldiers with ANSAs. \u0001e methods of one NGO, ACDK, are examined in detail. 257 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 ACDK's executive director explained that the decisions to embark upon negotiations with ANSAs to release child soldiers most typically originate in \u0091complaints from parents of children, other actors in civil society or other community organisations\u0092. 19 ACDK manages this process by employing the SMART \u0097 \u0091speci\u00aec, measurable, attainable, realistic and temporary\u0092 \u0097 method of communication to negotiate the release of child soldiers with ANSAs, when de\u00aening the objective of the communication with the ANSA. 20 Achieving the release of child soldiers involves identifying \u0091advocacy targets\u0092, de\u00aening the message to send to the \u0091decision maker\u0092 (derived from in-depth research), identifying allies (in\u00afuencers or intermediaries), analysing the risk and success factors, developing an action plan, and advocating with groups. 21 A number of participants noted di\u0002culties in communicating with ANSAs on the issue of child soldiers. Several representatives described a signi\u00aecant lack of trust, as ANSAs fear that NGOs will disclose to the authorities their location, their \u0091 modus operandi \u0092, and instances of child recruitment or abuse. 22 Participants emphasised that gaining trust was therefore an essential prerequisite for any engagement with ANSAs. \u0001ey listed various ways of establishing trust with groups, including sending intermediaries who are of the same ethnicity and who speak the same language as the group; meeting in neutral places; frequent courtesy visits; o\u0003ering aid to the wounded; o\u0003ering training; staying with the group and sharing a meal ; and ensuring con\u00aedentiality. 23 Building a rapport with a network of ANSAs facilitates translation of 19 Interview with Participant D, executive director, Action Communautaire pour le Developpement du Kivu (ACDK) (12 September 2020). 20ibid 187; Interview with Participant D (n 19). 21 ibid. 22Anonymous survey response; interview with Participant B, executive director, Jeunesse a l'Oeuvre de la Charite et du Developpement (JOCHADEV) (11 September 2020). 23 Interview with Participant J, national coordinator, Union des Juristes Engag\u00e9s pour les Opprim\u00e9s, la Paix et le D\u00e9veloppement (UJEOPAD) (23 September 2020). 258 York Law Review the norm, as ANSAs are more likely to be receptive to NGO in\u00afuence if trust is established. 3.1.2 Suitability of the Mechanism \u0001e national coordinator of UJEOPAD asserted that securing the release of child soldiers is one of their organisation's \u0091most important and privileged activities\u0092. 24 Survey responses, however, indicated that their negotiations to release child soldiers were only partially e\u0003ective. An important question for re\u00afection is whether the release of child soldiers is a mechanism that assists the translation of the prohibition of the recruitment and deployment of child soldiers. Owing to the ad hoc nature of negotiations to release child soldiers, it is questionable how far these impromptu negotiations can assist in the broader translation of the prohibition. \u0001is is a particularly pressing concern when negotiations are being used by certain organisations as the sole method of norm translation. In terms of process, the national coordinator of ACPD explained that they \u00aerst present ANSA leaders with their release proposal. In any response, the ANSA's leadership will typically include requests that the NGO will have to comply with in order to secure the release of the child. \u0001ese requests often include \u00aenancial incentives or speci\u00aec measures, such as requiring that children be placed in demobilisation centres. 25 However, when negotiations are based on a mutually bene\u00aecial exchange, the release of the child can become transactional, rather than amounting to any acceptance or translation of the norm. \u0001e ACPD coordinator suggested that ANSAs continue to recruit children, as having them in their ranks places the group in a position to negotiate with organisations. 26\u0001ey explained that , if an ANSA has child soldiers, INGOs and local NGOs will approach the group in an attempt 24 ibid. 25 Interview with Participant K, national coordinator, Action Chretienne Pour La Paix Et Le D\u00e9veloppement (ACPD). 26 ibid. Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 to release them. 27\u0001is places the ANSA in a position to negotiate the release and ask for something in return. 28 Hottinger warns that \u0091once you are caught in such a dynamic, where every issue is up for a bargain, you are bound to create more harm than good\u0092. 29\u0001is suggests a complete lack of translation of the norm as the motivation for granting the release is based on ensuring a bene\u00aet. A number of participants claimed that armed groups often request items of monetary value in exchange for the release of children. One survey respondent highlighted that for \u0091any communication with them, you need \u00aenancial motivation\u0092. 30\u0001is requirement was illustrated by the executive director of ACDK, who reported that, despite completing all of the above stages, the organisation had to pay 100 US dollars to secure the release of one child in 2017. 31 Whilst an e\u0003ective way of securing the freedom of children, practices such as the exchange of an item of monetary value for the release of a child soldier can be detrimental to the translation of the norm, owing to its incentive capacities. \u0001is is largely analogous to the ransom dilemma that often characterises hostage situations. Outlining the \u0091complicity objection\u0092 theory, Howard argues that \u0091[t]hose who pay ransoms to unjust organisations, become reluctant accomplices to those organisations' unjust activities\u0092. 32 If this hostage dilemma is applied, it can be argued that, by giving money to an ANSA in exchange for a child, the NGO is contributing to or \u00aenancing further child recruitment. A local NGO, ACPD, has, however, devised a method to ensure that the pecuniary bene\u00aets of a transactional negotiation are directed 27 ibid. 28 ibid. 29 Hottinger (n 1) 25. 30 Anonymous survey response. 31 Interview with Participant D (n 19). 32 Je\u0003rey Howard, \u0091Kidnapped: the Ethics of Paying Ransoms\u0092 (2018) 35(4) J Applied Phil 681. 260 York Law Review towards the children. 33\u0001e national coordinator explained that the ANSA will agree to release the children if the NGO has the correct funds to support their demands. 34\u0001ese funds , however, will not be utilised by the ANSA for their \u00aenancial gain but instead used on the condition that NGO funds and facilitates the release of child soldiers into demobilisation centres. 35\u0001is particular type of negotiation indicates the di\u0003usion of the norm as a group can only make \u00aenancial requests that will bene\u00aet the children. It remains, however, a transactional exchange, as the research participant warned that, if the NGO does not have enough funding, the deals will often fall through. \u0001is is a crucial limitation in this type of negotiation. 36 \u0001e research carried out highlighted that not all negotiation techniques employed by local NGOs are transactional in their natu re. \u0001e national coordinator of UJEOPAD explained that the substance of their negotiations with ANSA leaders focussed solely on the \u0091national and international legal instruments that protect children and prohibit their recruitment\u0092 and informs them of the risk of keeping children in the group. 37\u0001e participant stated that , after presenting this information through talks, as well as providing supporting documentation, they leave the group and wait for the leadership to call with their decision. 38 \u0001is process is arguably more e\u0003ective at norm translation, as pecuniary incentives are removed from the decision-making process. When \u00aenancial bene\u00aets are discounted, the decision to release may be more likely to be based on a belief that children should not be members of that group. However, the data here does not indicate whether any decisions to discontinue such practices result from a fear of potential sanctions or a recognition on the part of the ANSA leadership that child 33 Interview with Participant K (n 25). 34 Interview with Participant K (n 25). 35 Interview with Participant K (n 25). 36 ibid. 37 Interview with Participant J (n 23). 38 Interview with Participant J (n 23). 261 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 recruitment is morally wrong. One might doubt the e\u0002cacy of this negotiation style owing to its lack of incentive for the ANSA. It has, however, been relatively successful \u0097 UJEOPAD has secured the release of 600 children from ANSAs since 2014. 39\u0001is amounts to 4 per cent of the overall approximate number of children released over this time period. 40 It is signi\u00aecant that this has been achieved by one NGO, utilising one method. If applied by other of NGOs and supplemented by additional mechanisms, it may have signi\u00aecant potential in translating the norm. 3.2 Education/Training of Armed Group Members 3.2.1 Summary \u0001e empirical data collected also pointed to the delivery of training for ANSA members as another mechanism often employed by NGOs to support the prohibition of child recruitment and use. \u0001e data suggests that there are two di\u0003erent approaches typically employed by NGOs when o\u0003ering training for ANSA members. \u0001ese alternat ive approaches represent norm entrepreneurs' di\u0003erent ways of \u0091framing\u0092 the issue of child recruitment. \u0001is st rategic framing can be understood as \u0091an integral vehicle for transmitting norms, [as it helps to] create shared understandings that further legitimate and motivate collective action\u0092. 41 Framing is employed with the aim of \u0091actively assess[ing] the content of a particular norm and \u0093chang[ing] their minds\u0094\u0092. 42 \u0001e \u00aerst framing approach employed by NGOs focusses on educating 39 Interview with Participant J (n 23). 40 United Nations Security Council, \u0091Children and Armed Con\u00afict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Report of the Secretary-General\u0092 (UN DOC S/2018/502, 25 May 2018) 18; United Nations Security Council, \u0091Children and Armed Con\u00afict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Report of the Secretary-General\u0092 (S/2020/1030, 19 October 2020) 1. 41 Labonte (n 3) 4. 42 Ryan Goodman and Derek Jinks, \u0091How to In\u00afuence States: Socialization and International Human Rights Law\u0092 (2004) 54 Duke LJ 621, 635. 262 York Law Review ANSA leaders as to the laws prohibiting the use of child soldiers at both national and international levels, as well as the potential consequences of non-compliance. In addition to providing training to ANSAs on the legal framework, OPD also o\u0003ers technical training to assist ANSAs in applying the law on the ground. For example, they o\u0003er training on determining the age of new recruits and how to review identity documents, evaluate physical appearances, and conduct interviews with children. 43 An alternative framing approach is utilised by other NGOs, and is aimed at educating ANSAs on the psychosocial consequences of recruiting child soldiers. ACPD prefers to focus on such implications, designing and delivering workshops entitled \u0091What If It Was Your Child?\u0092 In framing their activities in this way, the organisations are emphasising the pain of parents when children are forcibly taken or when they voluntarily join armed groups. 44 3.2.2 Suitability of the Mechanism Within the context of this study, NGOs generally supported the training and education of ANSAs, with 60 per cent (n=9) of survey respondents explaining that these measures are extremely important in preventing the use of child soldiers. \u0001e national coordinator of ACPD, for example, argued that the most e\u0002cient way to induce the release of child soldiers is through the provision of educational workshops. 45\u0001e data did, however, highlight disagreements as to which approach is the most e\u0003ective method to translate the prohibition to ANSAs. Within the literature, David Capie emphasises that \u0091[i]t is the quality of their ideas and the nature of their reasoning that results in a particular norm's adoption by targets\u0092, thus highlighting the importance of the \u0091framing\u0092 of the norm in the provision of training. 46 43 Interview with Participant E, Executive director, Organisation for Peace and Development (OPD) (14 September 2020). 44 Interview with Participant K (n 25). 45 Interview with Participant K (n 25). 46 David Capie, \u0091In\u00afuencing Armed Groups: Are \u0001ere Lessons to Be Drawn from Socialization Literature?\u0092 in Geneva Call (ed) (n 1) 87. 263 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 Participants who had delivered training stated that their work mainly focussed on the legal framework concerning the use of child soldiers. \u0001is re\u00afects He\u0003es 's point that \u0091providing information and training on IHL [international humanitarian law] is essential to increase ANSAs respect for this legal framework\u0092, as very often ANSAs \u0091have little knowledge of the actual content of IHL\u0092. 47 According to Goodman and Jinks\u0092 accumulation theory, group actors experience pressure to comply with group norms. New group members are exposed to, and experience pressure to comply with, group norms via a process of \u0091cuing\u0092, which prompts them to re-evaluate their beliefs in relation to those of the group. 48 Further \u00aendings raised doubts as to the sustainability of solely educating ANSAs on the legal consequences of child recruitment. All interview participants stated that ANSA leaders were aware of the illegality of child soldier recruitment, and the threat of prosecution by the ICC. \u0001e national coordinator of ACPD explained that their organisation only broaches the legal prohibitions and risk of being prosecuted at the end of the training they provide, owing to armed groups having little fear of this consequence, as they have an awareness that prosecutions due to non-compliance are extremely rare. 49\u0001is line of argument points to a lack of e\u0003ectiveness in the deterrent role of legal prohibitions. Additionally, this counters He\u0003es's claim that ANSAs have minimal awareness of international humanitarian law. If there is no perceived \u0091cost\u0092 of using child soldiers, educating armed groups on the laws prescribing its prohibition is arguably of little use in translating the norm and ensuring compliance. 47 Ezequiel He\u0003es, \u0091Non-state Actors Engaging Non- state Actors: Call in NIACs\u0092 in Ezequiel He\u0003es, Marcos D Kotlik and Manuel J Ventura (eds) International Humanitarian Law and Non-State Actors: Debates, Law and Practice (Asser Press 2020) 7. 48 Goodman and Jinks (n 42) 637. 49 Interview with Participant K (n 25). 264 York Law Review An alternative approach is applied by ACPD. \u0001e national coordinator explained that the NGO \u00aends it more bene\u00aecial to play on the emotions of the ANSA members, in an attempt to induce an empathic response. 50 Such a technique may involve asking ANSA members to imagine that their child was recruited and had endured such horri\u00aec experiences. 51 For the national coordinator of UJEOPAD, the \u0091personal convictions\u0092 of the leadership are one of the most important factors in determining whether an ANSA will release children. 52 A recent study conducted by Martinez and others found evidence that \u0091perspective-taking propensities relate to the tendency to experience empathic-concern, which in\u00afuences guilt-pron eness; this propensity to experience guilt, in turn, negatively predicts criminal behaviour\u0092. 53\u0001is technique is apparent in the ACPD's methods, as teaching ANSA members to see the harms as if they were committed on their own child can introduce an emotional connection to child recruitment. 54\u0001is \u0091give[s] rise to the capacity to experience anticipatory distress, (guilt) should one face the option to\u0092 accept a child into the armed group. 55 Evidence suggests that this process may in\u00afuence and possibly change an individual's personal conviction that child recruitment and use is acceptable. 56\u0001is can be seen as an e\u0003ective mechanism in achieving translation of the norm, for those who are susceptible to emotional in\u00afuence. \u0001is framing could apply particularly to ANSAs that are unresponsive to the perceived threat of formal prosecution. 50 Interview with Participant K (n 25). 51 Interview with Participant K (n 25). 52 Interview with Participant J (n 23). 53 Martinez Andres, Je\u0003rey Stuewig, and June P Tangney, 1659, ibid. ibid. \u0097 Spring 2021 Geneva Call's approach attempts to combine the teaching of international law with appropriate technical training based on the needs of the ANSA, similar to OPD. An interviewee explained that the context, size, and structure of the group will a\u0003ect who the organisation carries out training with and what is focussed upon. 57 Geneva Call's engagement with one ANSA, the Alliance of Patriots for a Free and Sovereign Congo (ACPLS), is demonstrative of this, with the ACPLS requesting training \u0091on age assessment methods and processes, as they were lacking the capacity to carry them out\u0092. 58 In their study, Rojas and Fresard found that simply having knowledge of the law does not mean \u0091that combatants will conform to it in a real-life situation\u0092. 59 It could therefore be argued that it is counterintuitive to educate ANSAs on the law and not educate them on how to implement it \u0097 the provision of training solely on legal provisions is an unsuitable mechanism in norm translation. It has been established that \u0091[i]t is critical to analyse the context, such as the NSA's structure [and] motivations\u0092, before commencing training. 60 It will then be possible to formulate a realistic strategy, appropriate to the group it is being provided to. Training that is aligned with the ANSAs ideology is more likely to translate the prohibition than a one size \u00aets all approach used for all groups. 57 Interview with Participant G, employee, Geneva Call (5 August 2020). 58 Pascal Bongard and Ezequiel He\u0003es, \u0091Engaging Armed Non-State Actors on the Prohibition of Recruiting and Using Children in Hostilities: Some Re\u00afections from Geneva Call's Experience\u0092 (2019) 101 Int'l Rev Red Daniel Munoz-Rojas and Jean-Jacques Fresard, \u0091 \u0001e of Behaviour Understanding and Preventing IHL Violations\u0092 (2004) 86 Int'l Rev Red Cross 189, 196. 60 Greta Zeender, \u0091Protecting the Internally Displaced: an Opportunity for International NGOs to Engage NSAs\u0092 (2005) 24(3) Refugee Survey Q 96, 105. 266 York Law Review 3.3 Unilateral Declarations 3.3.1 Summary Rojas and Fresard argue that, \u0091as far as combatants are concerned, if IHL is to be respected, it is more important to in\u00afuence behaviour than attitudes\u0092. 61 Declarations signed by ANSAs provide an express and written commitment on the prohibition of child soldier recruitment and attempt to bind ANSAs to change their behaviour. In the DRC, local NGOs have designed unilateral declarations that allow ANSAs to make signed commitments not to recruit children. For example, local NGO UJEOPAD explained that they had designed three di\u0003erent standard forms of unilateral declaration: 1) a document for ANSAs to sign and \u0091commit to no longer recruiting or using child soldiers\u0092 ; 2) a declaration that states they are \u0091not to recruit again the children whose release we have already negotiated\u0092 ; and 3) a more comprehensive document that is an agreement to \u0091respect the norms of war, the protection of civilians, national and international legal texts for the protection of the rights of the child, that the groups sign after each training\u0092. 62 Local NGO Centre Resolution Con\u00aficts (CRC) has designed what they call \u0091a deed of engagement\u0092 63 mirroring Geneva Call's internationally renowned \u0091Deed of Commitment\u0092. \u0001is deed is signed by ANSAs that commit \u0091not to recruit any more children\u0092. 64 Geneva Call's \u0091Deed of Commitment\u0092 (DOC) was developed primarily for use with ANSAs. \u0001e DOC is signed by ANSA leaders and countersigned by Geneva Call and the Government of the Republic and Canton of Geneva. 65Geneva 61 ibid 205. 62 Interview with Participant J (n 23). 63 Interview with Participant F, employee, Centre Resolution Con\u00afits (CRC) (26 September 2020). 64 ibid. 65 Pascal Bongard and Jonathan Somer, \u0091Monitoring Armed Non-state Actor Compliance with Humanitarian Norms: A Look at International Mechanisms and the Geneva Call Deed of Commitment\u0092 (2011) 93 Int'l Rev Red Cross 673, 684. 267 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 Call has engaged with seven ANSAs in the DRC. 66\u0001e organisation has successfully facilitated the signing of one declaration in 2016, with the ACPLS, a commitment focussed on the protection of children in armed con\u00afict. 67\u0001is includes both negative and positive obligations \u0091to ensure that children are not recruited into our armed forces, whether voluntarily or under duress\u0092. 68 3.3.2 Suitability of the Mechanism Despite the fact that ANSAs are bound by international law, which prohibits the recruitment and use of child soldiers, alongside the abstract nature of international norms and their lack of involvement in its creation, ANSAs often feel as if they are not bound by the provisions of international law. 69 Unilateral declarations are excellent tools in empowering ANSAs to commit to humanitarian norms, as the powers of persuasion utilised by NGOs are \u0091a communication act intended to modify the mental state of an individual in a context where he retains or believes that he retains a certain freedom\u0092. 70\u0001rough the process of adoption, ANSAs are in eVect making their own written and formal commitments to humanitarian law. \u0001e national coordinator of UJEOPAD suggested that ANSAs are more likely to \u0091keep to their promises\u0092 if the declaration is written. 71\u0001is attitude was generally re\u00afected across the research participants, but some did express concerns relating to ANSAs not abiding by the declarations, highlighting issues 66 Geneva Call, \u0091Where We Work\u0092 <https://www.genevacall.org/where-we-work/> accessed 28 September 2020. 67 Acte d'Engagement aupr\u00e8s de l'Appel de Gen\u00e8ve November 2016) <http://theirwords.org/media/transfer/doc/signed_doc_apcls- bed635e4c57888eb0d30381a66c53166.pdf> accessed 28 September 2020. 68 Article 4 of DOC signed with Geneva Call. 69 ICRC, \u0091Increasing Respect for International Humanitarian Law in Non-International Armed Con\u00aficts International Committee of the Red Cross Geneva\u0092 (ICRC, February 2008) 19. 70 Munoz-Rojas and Fresard (n 59) 205. 71 Interview with Participant J (n 23). 268 York Law Review in the translation of the norm. 72\u0001e executive director of OPD argued that, whilst there has been positive, personal, and collective engagement with declarations, perhaps inevitably, \u0091signing was something and execution of release and liberation of children was another thing\u0092. 73\u0001is behaviour suggests that the ANSAs that sign the declarations may concede that the use of child soldiers \u0091is contrary to morality in absolute terms\u0092, yet they will tell themselves \u0091that circumstances render it not only admissible but also necessary\u0092 to recruit them. 74\u0001ere is, as such, evidence of a disconnect between commitments made and actions taken. \u0001e executive director of OPD, however, maintained that the mechanism is eYcient only if there is permanent and consistent monitoring, which will in turn encourage implementation and thus increase diVusion of the norm. 75 NGOs, however, require adequate resources to carry out this monitoring, which is often an issue for smaller, more local organisations. One interviewee pointed to the notion that declarations are often used by more \u00aenancially endowed NGOs. 76 However, a local NGO, CRC, has managed to develop a more resourceful and cost-eVective method of monitoring violations to their \u0091deed of engagement\u0092. An employee explained that, once there has been a report of a child in an ANSA that has signed a deed of engagement with the CRC, the organisation will request that the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) collects the child from the ANSA. 77 Under MONUSCO's Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration programme, they release children from ANSAs and place them in the 72 Interview with Participant J (n 23 ); interview with Participant E (n 4 3); interview with Participant K (n 25). 73 Interview with Participant E (n 43). 74 Munoz-Rojas and Fresard (n 59) 198. 75 Interview with Participant E (n 43). 76 Interview with Participant B (n 22). 77 Interview with Participant F (n 63). 269 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 care of NGOs that MONUSCO has a relationship with. 78\u0001is is a more cost-eVective method for local NGOs as negotiation, retrieval, and monitoring responsibilities are transferred to MONUSCO, with local NGOs focussing on rehabilitation and reintegration. \u0001e CRC employee described this as an extremely eVective method, resulting in a \u0091containment site\u0092 being constructed to accommodate all of the children whose release had been facilitated by this mechanism. 79 Large INGOs, such as Geneva Call, must still take resources into consideration. An employee explained that a deed of commitment will only be proposed if Geneva Call has the capacity to follow up on the deed, its implementation plan, and monitoring. 80 Geneva Call has been successful with its monitoring programme, as \u0091[n]o signatory has ever refused to receive a Geneva Call delegation, even following allegations of non-compliance\u0092, suggesting that ANSAs are willing to be monitored. 81\u0001e organisation has also installed permanent staV in the DRC to facilitate easier access to local NGO partners and ANSAs for communication and monitoring purposes. 82\u0001e signing of any declaration is only eVective in diVusing the norm if it is implemented and consistently complied with. Monitoring is therefore arguably an essential condition to bolster compliance and subsequent translation of the norm. However, this can render this mechanism inaccessible to smaller, local NGOs that lack the capacity to carry out sustained monitoring. 3.4 Summary \u0001is section has considered three voluntary translation mechanisms used in the DRC to help translate the international prohibition on child soldier recruitment to ANSAs, namely ad hoc agreements, education, 78 Pardonne interview. 79 Interview with Participant F (n 63). 80 Interview with Participant G (n 57). 81 Bongard and Somer (n 65) 695. 82 Interview with Participant G (n 57). 270 York Law Review and unilateral declarations. Empirical \u00aendings suggest that negotiations to release child soldiers that lack a transactional exchange are more eVective in translating the norm. With reference to the provision of training for ANSAs, it has been illustrated that in-depth research is required before conducting training that the ANSA will be receptive to. Declarations not to use child soldiers seem to be eVective in translating the norm, but only when the declaration is followed by monitoring activities to ensure implementation. \u0001e empirical data suggests that each of these mechanisms suVers drawbacks and that the use of single mechanisms alone is unlikely to be eVective in translating the prohibition of child recruitment and use. \u0001e data suggests that the most suitable way to translate the prohibition is through sustained engagement with ANSAs, u tilising a variety of mechanisms. \u0001is can , however, be diYcult to maintain, as the con\u00afict in the DRC involves a multitude of ANSAs that regularly fragment and change leadership. 83 Furthermore, many NGOs do not have the capacity or resources to employ multiple mechanisms and to ensure follow-up visits, which inhibits success. For those ANSAs that do not wish to voluntarily comply with the norm or require an extra push, a form of coercive translation may be required. In the DRC, the International Criminal Court (ICC) is a prominent force and its work is subject to analysis in the next section of this paper. 4Coercive Translation Mechanisms 4.1 Prosecution by the International Criminal Court (ICC) Formed in 2002, the ICC is a permanent judicial organisation situated in \u0001 e Hague, the Netherlands. 84\u0001e Rome Statute, which established the court and outlined its jurisdiction, was rati\u00aeed by the DRC two months before it came into force, which points to a clear commitment 83 Interview with Participant G (n 57). 84 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (adopted 17 July 1998, entered into force 1 July 2002, 2187 UNTS), art 13. 271 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 to its jurisdiction at the nation state level. 85\u0001e court is unique, as it has the power to prosecute any individual under the following conditions: where that person is a national of a state that is party to the Rome Statute, or where the state accepts the court's jurisdiction, or where the oVence took place in a state that is party to the statute. 86\u0001e court may exercise its jurisdiction when a crime is referred to the prosecutor by a state party, where the prosecutor has independently initiated an investigation, or where a crime has been referred to the prosecutor by the UN Security Council. 87 In addition, under the legal principle of \u0091complementarity\u0092, the court will only exercise jurisdiction when the state party \u0091is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution\u0092 and the individual has not already been tried for the speci\u00aec complaint. 88 As rampant impunity is central to the DRC con\u00afict, the court is therefore in a unique position, in that such countries that lack the power or political will to prosecute can refer crimes to the ICC. 4.2 ICC Prosecutions President Joseph Kabila of the DRC sent a case referral to the ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo on 3 March 2004. 89\u0001e ICC 's investigations began on 21 June 2004 and have been based predominantly \u0091on alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, committed mainly in eastern DRC\u0092, To date, the ICC has successfully prosecuted three individuals relating to crimes committed in the DRC \u0097 two of whom were prosecuted for the enlistment and conscription of 85 ibid. 86 ibid art 12. 87 ibid art 13. 88 ibid art 17(1). 89 ICC, \u0091ICC \u0097 Prosecutor Receives Referral of the Situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo\u0092 ( ICC, 19 April 2004) <https://www.icc- cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=prosecutor+receives+referral+of+the+situation+in+the +democratic+republic+of+congo> accessed 25 September 2020. 272 York Law Review children under the age of 15. 90\u0001is section focus ses on the prosecution of those two defendants \u0097 \u0001omas Lubanga and Bosco Ntaganda. 91 \u0001omas Lubanga leader of the Union des Patriotes Congolais (UPC), an ANSA that operated in the Ituri region until 2003. 92 Prosecutors in the case stated that, \u0091at the height of the con\u00afict in 2003, as many as 30,000 children were part of Mr Lubanga's militia\u0092. 93 Human Rights Watch reported locals in Ituri regularly describing the UPC as \u0091an army of children\u0092. 94 As a result, in January 2006 the ICC prosecution \u00aeled an arrest warrant for \u0001omas Lubanga, who was detained and subsequently transferred to \u0001e Hague. At the trial's conclusion in 2012, Lubanga was charged as co-perpetrator for three counts of the war crime: of \u0091conscripting or enlisting children under the age of \u00aefteen years, into armed forces or groups, or using them to participate actively in hostilities\u0092 contrary to Article 8(2)(e)(vii) of the Rome Statute. 95 Lubanga was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment on 10 July 2012. 96 On subsequent appeal, both the conviction and sentence were upheld by the ICC. 97 90 ICC, Situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (ICC\u0096 and Bosco Ntaganda Mazurek, \u0091 Prosecutor v \u0001omas Lubanga Dyilo: \u0001e International Criminal Court as It Brings Its First Case to Trial\u0092 (2009) 86 U Det Mercy L Rev 535. 93 Simons Marlise, \u0091Congo Warlord's Case Is First for International Criminal Court\u0092 New York Times (New \u0002ork, 10 November 2006) <https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/10/world/europe/congo-warlords-case-is-\u00aerst- for-international-criminal-court.html> accessed 29 September 2020. 94 Editorial, \u0091 \u0001e Democratic Republic of Congo: ITURI: \u0003iolence in North-Eastern DR Congo\u0092 (2003) 15(11A) Human Rights Watch 47. 95 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (n 85). 96\u0002omas Lubanga Dyilo (n 90) Ntaganda, nicknamed \u0091 \u0001e Terminator \u0092, was the deputy chief of general staV and commander of military operations of the Patriotic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (FPLC), the military wing of the UPC. 98\u0001e ICC issued a sealed arrest warrant in August 2006, followed by an unsealed arrest warrant in 2008. 99 Having surrendered voluntarily at the US Embassy in Rwanda, Ntaganda's trial began in \u0001e Hague on 2 September 2015. \u0001e j udgment was given on 8 July 2019, with Ntaganda found guilty of 18 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed between 2002 and 2003 in Ituri, DRC. 100 He was found to be an indirect perpetrator of all other crimes, including child recruitment and use. 101 He has been sentenced to 30 years\u0092 imprisonment. 4.2.1 Suitability of the Mechanism When applied to the crime of child recruitment and deployment in armed con\u00afict, the deterrent function of the ICC is of particular signi\u00aecance in the DRC, given that the \u0091abysmal\u0092 national criminal justice system lacks the impartiality, resources, and authority to penalise members of ANSAs. 102 Research participants consistently stated that the lack of prosecution of those individuals involved in the recruitment of child soldiers continues to contribute to poor translation 98 Sarah T Deuitch, \u0091Putting the Spotlight on \u0093 \u0001e Terminator \u0094: How the ICC Prosecution of Bosco Ntaganda Could Reduce Sexual \u0003iolence During Con\u00afict\u0092 (2016) 22 Wm & Mary J Women & L 3 655, 678. 99\u0001e ICC sealed the arrest warrant \u0091because public knowledge of the proceedings in this case might result in Bosco Ntaganda hiding, \u00afeeing, and/or endangering the Court\u0092.

When asked about the signi\u00aecance of prosecutions in preventing the use of child soldiers, 86 per cent (n=13) of survey respondents stated that prosecutions at an international level were either very or extremely eVective, emphasising the value of ICC prosecutions. After a visit to the DRC, ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda made a statement in which deterrence was a common theme. 103 Bensouda discussed two diVerent forms of deterrence theory: prosecutorial deterrence and social deterrence. 104 Emphasising prosecutorial deterrence, Bensouda described the almost \u0091omnipotent\u0092 strength of the court to prosecute any individual that commits such heinous crimes as child recruitment, re\u00afecting Simmons's theory that prosecutorial deterrence amounts to \u0091anticipated legalized, court-ordered punishment\u0092. 105 Social deterrence theory is also deployed by Bensouda, as she claims that it \u0091is the responsibility of all\u0092 to ensure the translation of humanitarian law owing to the \u0091extra-legal social costs associated with law violation\u0092. 106 Jo and Simmons argue that the ICC is highly in\u00afuential when \u0091prosecutorial and social deterrence reinforce one another\u0092. 107\u0001is occurs when legal, social, domestic, and international mechanisms interact to reduce the perpetration of crimes and thus increase diVusion of the norm. 103 ICC, \u0091Statement by the ICC Prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, at the Conclusion of Her \u0003isit to the DRC: \u0093 \u0001e Fight Against Impunity and the Critical Prevention of Crimes Under the Rome Statute are Essential for Social Stability\u0094\u0092 (ICC, 4 May 2018). 104 Hyeran Jo and Beth A Simmons, \u0091Can the International Criminal Court Deter Atrocity?\u0092 (2016) 70 International Organization 443. 105 ibid. 106 ICC, \u0091Statement by the ICC Prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, at the Conclusion of Her \u0003isit to the DRC: \u0093 \u0001e Fight Against Impunity and the Critical Prevention of Crimes Under the Rome Statute are Essential for Social Stability\u0094\u0092 (n 103). 107 Jo and Simmons (n 104) 444. 275 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 I. Prosecutorial Deterrence Based on a rationalist model, deterrence is predicated on the conscious choice of whether or not to commit a crime. 108 Rational choice theory, developed by Becker, consists of two elements. 109 First, individuals will commit a crime when the predicted utility of committing the crime is greater than the objective probability of being prosecuted for it 110 and, second, where the predicted utility minus the punishment is greater than the objective probability of being prosecuted. 111\u0001is theory is , however, based on individuals being able to understand the likelihood of being captured and prosecuted. It is diYcult to apply this theory in protracted, complex contexts, as it is based on predictions concerning constantly shifting variables. When examining the activities of members of ANSAs in the DRC that operate largely \u0091in the bush\u0092 and oV grid, with groups frequently fragmenting, it is diYcult to conceive that members would objectively be able to weigh the probability of punishment. \u0001e most signi\u00aecant criticism of rational based deterrence theories, according to Pogarsky, is that they rest on the predicted behaviour of the \u0091rational\u0092 individual, or the \u0091deterrable\u0092 individual. 112\u0001is is an individual or group that has the potential to be in\u00afuenced by the threat of prosecution and is likely to be more receptive to accepting the norm. 113\u0001ere are , however, individuals who do not react \u0091rationally\u0092 in certain situations, or at all. In the literature, these individuals have 108 Jeremy Bentham, An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation (Clarendon Press 1907); Cesare Beccaria and Marchese di \u0003oltaire , Essay on Crimes & Punishments (Stephen Gould 1809). 109 Gary S Becker, \u0091Crime and Punishment: An Economic Approach\u0092 (1968) 76 J Poli Econ 169. 110 Ross L Matsueda, Derek A Kreager, and David Huizinga, \u0091Deterring Delinquents: A Choice \u0001eft and \u0092 (2006) 71(1) Am Pogarsky, \u0091Identifying \u0093Deterrable\u0094 OVenders: Implications for Research on Deterrence\u0092 (2002) 19 Justice Q 3. 113 ibid. 276 York Law Review been described as \u0091incorrigible oVenders\u0092, owing to their unresponsiveness to an increased risk of formal sanction. 114\u0001e executive director of ACDK explained that \u0091leaders of the armed groups are aware of the threat of prosecution from the ICC\u0092 yet, they have a tendency \u0091to pretend and ignore this institution\u0092 and continue to recruit children. 115 Tom Farer supports this proposition, as he writes that a \u0091remote threat of criminal sanctions will not resonate in the paranoid world of domestic armed con\u00afict\u0092. 116 Such an interpretation indicates the diYculties that the ICC faces in diVusing the prohibition of child recruitment. \u0001e perceived thre at of prosecution may also be counterbalanced by knowledge that spheres of in\u00afuence will protect the individual. Broache's study suggests that the Ntaganda ICC warrant lacked a deterrent eVect \u0097 multiple CNDP/M23 oYcers reported Ntaganda's lack of fear both of arrest and of the ICC more generally. 117 Ntaganda's initial lack of response to the release of his arrest warrant can, however, be attributed to the fact that he had been promoted to a general in the DRC's national armed forces, thus ensuring his protection. President Kabila of the DRC refused to hand Ntaganda over to the ICC, publicly claiming that Ntaganda was an \u0091important partner for peace\u0092. 118\u0001is was a \u00afagrant violation of Article 12 of the Rome Statute, to which the DRC is a signatory, which states that the state party \u0091shall cooperate with the Court without any delay or exception\u0092. 119\u0001is is of particular 114 ibid. 115 Interview with Participant D (n 19). 116 Tom J Farer, \u0091Restraining the Barbarians: Can International Criminal Law Help?\u0092 (2000) 22 HuM RTs Q 90, 98. 117 M Broache, \u0091 Irrelevance, Instigation and Prevention: \u0001e Mixed EVects of International Criminal Court Prosecutions on Atrocities in the CNDP/M23 Case\u0092 (2016) 10 IJTJ 402. 118 Editorial, \u0091DR Congo: Arrest Bosco Ntaganda for ICC Trial President Suggests He's Willing to Apprehend General Wanted for War Crimes\u0092 ( Human Rights Watch , 13 April 2012) <https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/04/13/dr-congo-arrest-bosco-ntaganda- icc-trial> accessed 29 September 2020. 119 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (n 84). 277 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 poignancy within the DRC, where the state itself has referred the armed con\u00afict to the prosecutor as clear bias and political in\u00afuence was shown as to who the s tate feels should be prosecuted and who should not. \u0001is signi\u00aecantly weakens the legitimacy of the court in the DRC and consequently its deterrent eVects. \u0001is weakness is often attributed to the fact that the ICC requires cooperation by states and does not have the jurisdiction to carry out the arrest warrant alone. A national coordinator of a local NGO, ACPD, explained that the ICC's main technique is \u0091intimidation of perpetrators\u0092, yet the ICC often fails to implement its mandates owing to its lack of power, leading ANSAs to continue \u00afouting the law, thus reducing the ICC's eVectiveness. 120 \u0001e ICC 's focus on the \u0091big \u00aesh\u0092 such as Lubanga and Ntaganda may also be a reason for the lack of deterrence. 121 \u0091Small fries\u0092, suggests Alexander, may fail to be intimidated and thus perceive the risk of being prosecuted as little to non-existent. 122\u0001e national coordinator of ACPD agreed with this point, as he posited that the ICC's impact was limited by the fact that it has only prosecuted leaders, and that its impact could be increased if it prosecuted those who directly recruit child soldiers in the \u00aeeld. 123 Owing to resources and time constraints, the court aims to only indict those \u0091who bear the greatest responsibility\u0092, which, Alexander argues, has a greater chance of deterring other \u0091big \u00aesh\u0092. 124\u0001is method also relies on the \u0091big \u00aesh\u0092, translating the prohibition of the use of child soldiers vertically to regional commanders. Broache found that a signi\u00aecantly lower number of atrocities were committed after Ntaganda's surrender. 125\u0001e executive director of the OPD also argued that prosecutorial deterrence is in play, 120 Interview with Participant I, employee, Coalition des \u0003olontaires pour la Paix et le D\u00e9veloppement (C\u0003PD) (14 September 2020). 121 James F Alexander, \u0091 \u0001e International Criminal Court and the Prevention of Atrocities: Predicting the Court's Impact\u0092 (2009) 54 \u0003ill L Rev 17. 122 ibid. 123 Interview with Participant K (n 25). 124 Alexander (n 121). 125 Broache (n 117). 278 York Law Review as he stated that ANSAs release child soldiers because, according to them, the ICC \u0091apprehends even the most powerful It is not of their free will that they do it, it is under the constraint of justice.\u0092 126\u0001e analysis has demonstrated the general premise that an \u0091increase in the certainty, severity, or celerity of potential punishment, increases the perceived costliness of the contemplated oVense and can thereby discourage it\u0092 is not as straightforward as it seems when applied to complex con\u00aficts. 127 II. Social Deterrence Analysis of the ICC's potential powers of prosecutorial deterrence has revealed that, owing to a lack of resources and the length of proceedings, very few individuals can be prosecuted by the ICC, thus decreasing its ability to deter individuals. \u0001e successful prosecution of Lubanga and Ntaganda has, however, raised awareness of the illegality of child recruitment, provided clari\u00aecation of the law, and exposed the horri\u00aec eVects of child soldiering. \u0001ese consequences of the ICC prosecutions can also produce wider social deterrent eVects. Jo and Simmons describe social deterrence as a process whereby \u0091community norms are challenged in a clear way (signalled, for example, by ICC actions\u0092), which provides \u0091signi\u00aecant potential for a social reaction to law violations\u0092. 128 Finnemore and Sikkink postulate that \u0091[w]e only know what is appropriate by reference to the judgments of a community or a society\u0092. 129 \u0091We recognise norm-breaking behaviour because it generates disapproval or stigma.\u0092 130 One of the central issues with child soldiering is its wide acceptance in countries such as the DRC, where children's association with groups \u0091is 126 Interview with Participant E (n 43). 127 Pogarsky (n 112). 128 Jo and Simmons (n 104). 129 Finnemore and Sikkink (n 14) 892. 130 Finnemore and Sikkink (n 14) 892. 279 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 considered acceptable and even desirable\u0092. 131 Multiple research participants disclosed that ANSAs often recruit children and are subsequently reluctant to release them, for reasons that include the belief that children have mystical powers, that they hold the rites of war, and that they are war charms that protect the group from confrontation. 132 Child soldiers were described by a survey respondent as \u0091the raw materials of these rebels\u0092. 133 In addition, many families voluntarily send their children to join armed groups or are coerced by ANSAs. An interviewee reported that \u0091in some communities families have to send a child to the armed group in exchange for community protection\u0092. 134 Matambura writes that many in the DRC \u0091have misunderstood this progressive socialization of children into adult life holding children and youth as responsible for the defense of the community\u0092. 135 Social acceptance of the prohibition of child soldiering, is therefore a necessary prerequisite for complete translation of the norm. \u0001is is particularly poignant where community values \u0091are strong, but the formal institutions of law \u0097 policing, courts and formal con\u00aenement capacities \u0097 are weak\u0092, analogous to the situation in the DRC. 136 \u0001e prosecution of Lubanga and Ntaganda for the crime of child recruitment and use has elevated a widely accepted practice to one of serious international awareness and concern. All interview participants indicated fear of ICC prosecution as a motivation for releasing child soldiers. \u0001is is hugely signi\u00aecant, highlighting the previous lack of awareness of the illegality of child recruitment at an international level. 131 Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers, Brie\u00aeng Paper: Democratic Republic of Congo, Mai Mai Child Soldier Recruitment and Use, Entrenched and Unending (2010) 1. 132Interview with Participant D (n 19); interview with Participant E (n 4 3); anonymous survey response. 133 Survey response. 134 Interview with Anonymous Participant A (20 th August 2020). 135 ibid. 136 Jo and Simmons (n 104) 450. 280 York Law Review \u0001is has additionally been re\u00afected in evidence stated in the Human Rights Watch report, which emphasised civilian awareness of the illegality and negative eVects of children joining ANSAs. 137\u0001e report stated that \u0091child protection agencies admitted that the Lubanga case seems to have reached out to families in the region, much more eVectively than years of their own campaigning\u0092. 138 A report on the ICC's experience in the DRC additionally purports that \u0091children themselves had been educated about their rights and sensitised to their roles, as both victims and perpetrators, in a way which may impact their own future behaviour\u0092. 139 \u0001ere have, however, been claims that greater social awareness of the ICC prosecutions and the illegality of child recruitment has aVected child recruitment. A Human Rights Watch report states that, before the charges were brought against Lubanga, \u0091leaders openly admitted numbers of children in their ranks and handed children over.\u0092 140 \u0091Following the con\u00aermation of charges against Lubanga many denied having children under their command.\u0092 141 Activists dubbed this phenomenon \u0091Lubanga syndrome\u0092. 142\u0001is phenomenon appears to still exist. \u0001e secretary general of C\u0003PD claimed that ANSAs now refuse to admit that they use child soldiers, and \u0091continue to use them in secret, hiding their age, their identity cards, hiding them during visits\u0092. 143 Multiple participants further disclosed that communication and 137 Editorial, \u0091 Courting History: \u0001e Landmark International Criminal Court's First \u0002ears\u0092 ( Human Rights Watch , July 2008).

However, whilst re\u00afecting on these answers in their subsequent interviews, many participants did raise doubts about the overall, long-term eVectiveness of prosecutions in reducing the use of child soldiers. 4.3 Summary \u0001e analysis has revealed that theories of prosecutorial and social deterrence are diYcult to apply to protracted, complex armed con\u00aficts, such as in the DRC, as a plethora of factors are in play. Owing to the rampant impunity and political connections of ANSA leaders in the DRC, an ICC arrest warrant may not have the eVect of acting as a deterrent against further crimes, as the certainty of prosecution is perceived to be low. \u0001e prosecutions have certainly increased awareness of the illegality of child recruitment and use and the perceived certainty of prosecution, contributing to an increased translation and acceptance of the norm more generally. In reaction to increased enforcement, ANSAs appear to have adapted their behaviours to facilitate the continued recruitment of child soldiers, suggesting that there is a lack of reinforcement of both theories of deterrence, which is required for full translation of the norm. 145 It could therefore be 144 Interview with Participant C, deputy director, Synergy of Great Lakes Initiatives (S\u0002NIGL) (15 September 2020); interview with Participant B (n 2 2); anonymous survey response. 145 Jo and Simmons (n 104) 450. 282 York Law Review suggested that sensitisation to the norm is required on the ground, by NGOs and INGOs, to encourage diVusion of the norm and in the reinforcement of the theories of deterrence. Deterrence is therefore required at both a prosecutorial and a social level to achieve norm translation. 5Conclusion Using the case study of the DRC, this paper has sought to evaluate the suitability of mechanisms employed to translate the prohibition of child recruitment and use to the activities of ANSAs. It has drawn upon the \u00aendings of an empirical research project involving ten interviews and a small survey carried out with NGO representatives. In doing so, the paper has explored and analysed the most utilised and prominent mechanisms employed by both national and international actors. It has oVered a novel case study evaluation of a norm's translation, as well as an exploration of the variety of unique factors that inhibit NGOs' eVorts to translate the norm which prohibits the use of child soldiers in armed con\u00afict in the DRC. Notable factors that were identi\u00aeed through the course of the research were: the plethora of ANSAs; the rate at which they fragment and ce ase to exist; the \u0091incorrigible nature\u0092 of the individuals responsible for the recruitment of child soldiers; and the social acceptance of child recruitment. Given the range of these factors, it is apparent that it can be exceedingly diYcult for one mechanism to successfully translate the norm. \u0001e research \u00aendings indicate that there is a need for systemic reinforcement of the prohibition norm through a variety of methods, to allow the international prohibition to cascade and eventual internalise within ANSA leadership and the wider DRC. 146 \u0001is suggests that eVective translation requires a hybrid approach \u0097 combining voluntary and coercive translation mechanisms. \u0001e responses of survey participants supported this mixed approach, with 81 per cent (n=16) of survey respondents supporting mixed mechanisms to successfully prevent the use of child soldiers. A hybrid 146 Finnemore and Sikkink (n 13) 895. 283 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 approach does not, however, reduce the utility of each mechanism. It became evident during the course of this research that each ANSA is unique in its leadership, nature, and personnel, meaning that certain mechanisms are more eVective at translating the norm with some individuals and/or groups than others. With regard to voluntary translation mechanisms, three mechanisms and their application by local NGOs have been examined, providing a level of detail not previously available within the literature. \u0001is paper has argued that negotiations to release child soldiers were more eVective in translating the norm when they were not transactional in nature, in the context of the DRC. Where NGOs provide training on the use of child soldiers, it has been suggested that educating ANSAs in the legal provisions alone was less successful at diVusing the norm when not supplemented by technical training on the implementation of these provisions. An alternative approach which promotes empathy by emphasising the impact on the children, their families, and communities was considered to be preferable for norm translation, particularly for individuals unresponsive to the threat of prosecution. Overall, the signing of unilateral declarations was considered to be the most eVective voluntary mechanism, when two conditions are present to induce compliance and reduce relapse: 1) the application of alternative mechanisms, in which the declaration can be used to solidify a commitment to not recruit children, and 2) the ability of the NGO to carry out monitoring of the ANSA, to ensure compliance with the deed of commitment and hence increase translation. For all three mechanisms of voluntary translation to have a greater chance at ensuring translation, research by the NGOs into the ANSAs prior to engagement allowed organisations to adjust their approach to suit the style of the ANSA. It appears that doing so may increase the receptiveness of the ANSA in accepting the norm and may promote successful engagement with the mechanisms. Participants also reported that the three mechanisms were commonly not applied in isolation and often complemented one other, each incrementally bolstering the 284 York Law Review translation norm. However, such a mixed approach may be unavailable to smaller NGOs owing to resource constraints, whereas INGOs can often oVer a more sustained engagement package. Further research identifying ideal combinations and situational applications of voluntary translation mechanisms may provide local NGOs with the opportunity to direct their resources more appropriately. \u0001e most frequently cited coercive translation mechanism by research participants was prosecution by the ICC. Deterrence theory, which forms part of the narrative adopted by ICC prosecutors, was used to analyse this mechanism and revealed two diVerent, yet complementary, theories: prosecutorial and social deterrence. It has been argued that the ICC needs to successfully deter ANSAs on both of these levels to achieve norm internalisation. \u0001e analysis revealed that rational choice theories are extremely diYcult to apply in complex, protracted con\u00aficts such as in the DRC, as many other factors often outweigh the (remotely) perceived formal sanction. Prosecutions are considered, however, to have increased the overall social awareness of the illegality of child recruitment and use, and have contributed to the diVusion of the norm throughout the wider DRC population. \u0001e generally held view is that this may have increased perceived stigma relating to child soldier recruitment among some ANSAs, which is a step closer to acceptance and internalisation of the norm . \u0001ere are, similarly, a multitude of factors that limit the deterrence capabilities of the ICC in the DRC, suggesting that the ICC's remote and abstract nature is not conducive to ensuring successful translation of the norm alone. \u0001e ICC 's work requires supplementary sensitisation by NGOs on the ground, increasing awareness of the illegality of child recruitment and use and the psychosocial consequences on children. \u0001is reinforces the argument supporting a hybrid approach. Utilising a mixture of both voluntary and coercive mechanisms is the most suitable approach to achieve norm internalisation within ANSAs operating in the DRC. It would seem that the most eVective approach to achieve ANSAs\u0092 internalisation of the norm involves a combined intervention. 285 Volume \u0001 \u0097 Spring 2021 \u0001is would, ideally, comprise a mixture of direct NGO intera ction (training, negotiations, and signed commitments) together with prosecutorial deterrence. It is to be hoped that broader social acceptance of the prohibition will ensure its greater and more eVective internalisation by the ANSAs. While literature that analyses one type of mechanism exists, this piece has highlighted the utility of allowing the coercive and voluntary mechanisms to complement each other. More research needs to be carried out to understand how coercive and voluntary mechanisms can interact and reinforce each other to better inform the DRC community, so as to ensure greater translation of the norm.
