Yoga is recommended as a nonmainstream treatment for many health conditions, including SUDs. Methods: Five databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated yoga as an intervention in adults with any type of substance use disorder. The interventions being studied included Hatha yoga, Sudarshan Kriya yoga, breathing yoga exercises, and meditation. Studies, where yoga was combined with other interventions were excluded. The effect of yoga as an intervention was analyzed using primary outcomes such as anxiety, pain, and craving. Eight RCTs met the eligibility cri-teria, and quality analysis was conducted using the Cochrane criteria. Results: Among the 8 nal studies eligible for quality analysis, 2 had undened substance use, while the others were focused on tobacco, alcohol, or opioids. Seven out of 8 studies showed signicantresults and improved primary outcomes such as anxiety, pain, or substance use. Seven out of the 8studies showed signicant positive outcomes using yoga in conjunction with other pharmacological treatment modalities like opioid substitution therapy. Conclusions: Six out of 8 studies showed low concerns, while 2 studies showed some concerns about the risk of bias judgment. Although the results look encouraging, RCTs with larger sample size are needed to better evaluate the effectiveness of yoga as a treatment modality for substance use.

Keywords: Integrative Medicine, Meditation, Substance-Related Disorders, Yoga Background Substance use disorder (SUD) is described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of MentalDisorders (DSM-V) as a \"cluster of cognitive, be- havioral, and physiologic symptoms indicating thatthe individual continues using the substance despitesignicant substance-related problems. \" 1The etiol- ogy of SUD is characterized by complex interactionsbetween genetic, environmental, developmental,and social factors still being studied today. 2,3On the individual level, SUD alters neurochemical path-ways and behavioral patterns resulting in negative impacts on physical and mental health, such as poor sleep and nutrition, increased violence and trauma,and a higher risk of contracting a communicable dis- ease. 3,5,6SUD is classi ed as mild, moderate, or severe, with the most severe form characterized by chronic and compulsive substance use.1Traditional management of substance use disorder takes place ina specialized treatment program and typicallyincludes a combination of pharmacological interven-tion, behavioral therapy, and supportive services. 3 However, alternative treatments have becomeThis article was externally peer reviewed.

Downloaded from increasingly popular among patients due to increas- ing evidence of their effectiveness and the desire fortreatment options outside traditional medicine. 7 Yoga originated in India over 2 centuries ago and has since become increasingly incorporatedinto medical practice. 8Today, these practices are known as complementary and alternative medi-cine (CAM), de ned by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health as a non- mainstream practice that is used together with conventional medicine or as a substitute for con-ventional medicine. 9In substance use disorder, CAM modalities studied include acupuncture, hypnotherapy, herbal medicine, mindfulness, music therapy, and yoga.7Yoga, in particular, has been studied in SUDs as an effective alternative therapy and has been found to reduce stress and addictive behaviors while improving self-esteemand increasing self-control.10,11The 2012 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)showed that yoga was the third most common complementary health approach among adults. 12 The overall structure of yoga includes speci c breathing patterns ( pranayamas ), physical postures (asanas ), relaxation, and meditation (focused thoughts and breathing) that act together to improve the mind and body.8While the exact mechanisms of action are unclear, the use of yogaas a treatment for substance use disorder has beenfound to decrease addictive behaviors, enhancewell-being, and improve cognitive flexibil- ity. 8,10,13Assessing studies on yoga as an effective alternative therapy can provide information toclinicians seeking additional methods to reduce substance use and improve the quality of life in patients with substance use disorder.Figure 1.

Downloaded from There is a limited number of randomized con- trol trials (RCTs) assessing the bene ts of yoga, and many are underpowered and burdened by risk of bias due to small sample sizes.10To our knowl- edge, only 1 systematic review of randomized con-trol trials studying yoga in substance use disorder has been published in 2014. 10Therefore, in this systematic review, we explore and evaluate the most recently studied effects of yoga on adult patients with substance use disorder. Methods The systematic review included RCTs that studiedthe effect of yoga (including breathing and medita- tion) in adult patients 18 years and older with a sub- stance use disorder. The trials published on or after January 2013 until the team conducted the litera- ture search in January 2021 were included in thisreview. This study will provide evidence in continu- ation to the systematic review published in Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies ,p u b l i s h e d in 2014. 10Studies where yoga was combined with other interventions were excluded. Nonrandomized, quasi-experimental or observational studies were excluded as well. The databases used for systematic search were MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, and PsycINFO. The search methodology included keywords such as yoga, al-ternative treatment, substance use, addiction, drug dependence, alcohol use, and MeSH terms like Substance-Related Disorders. There were no additional articles found through manual search. The data screening was independently con- ducted by 2 reviewers and veri ed by 2 other coau- thors. In case of any disagreement in the screening between the 2 reviewers, it was resolved by the third and the fourth reviewers or via a consensus- based discussion. The data extraction was done by 3 reviewers using a preset data extraction form. Theinformation was extracted on author name, publica- tion journal and year, sample size, type of substance use disorder, comorbidities, if any, treatment details in intervention and control group, follow-up plan, outcome measures, conclusions, and biasesreported. The quality of the trials, using The Cochrane tool ROB2, 14was assessed based on 5 domains, namely bias due to randomization pro-cess, deviations from intended interventions, miss- ing outcome data, measurement of outcome, andTable 1.

The overall score was reported as H = high risk of bias, S = some con-cerns, and L = low risk of bias. Results The search across the databases yielded a total of488 manuscripts. After eliminating the duplicatesand screening the abstracts, 8 studies met our eligi- bility criteria and were included in the review. Figure 1 describes the PRISMA flow diagram of the multiple steps involved in selection process.The data extraction form is summarized in Table 1. Lyons et al 15studied the effect of mindfulness (yoga and meditation) versus a communicationskills session in 189 male prisoners (intervention arm = 88, control arm = 101) on preventing relapse in prisoners; 58% of the enrolled participants were African American with a mean age of 35.8611.3 years. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and craving scores declined in both arms, and mindfulness increased. When controlled for Freiburg mindfulness pretest, decline in anxiety and PTSD was greater in the intervention group than the control group ( P<.05). The authors concluded that the Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention (MBRP) program is a promising intervention adjunct to the substance use disorder treatment received in prison. Uebelacker et al 16assessed the acceptability and feasibility of hatha yoga for chronic pain relief in 35 eligible participants (mean age in yoga and control group was 43 610.7 and 44 610.8 years, respec- tively) receiving treatment as usual (TAU) in the form of opioid agonist therapy for opioid use disor- der. Participant mood improved pre-class to post- class (measured using a Likert scale survey to mea- sure sadness, anxiety, irritability), with greater decreases in anxiety and pain for high attenders(those who attended 6 or more classes) in the yoga group ( P<.05) as compared with those taking a health education class (see Table 2). The authorsconcluded that yoga could be delivered on-site at opioid agonist treatment programs with home prac-tice taken up by participants. Bock et al 17studied yoga as a complementary therapy for smoking cessation in 227 randomly selected people (yoga = 113, control = 114). The overall mean age of the participants was 46.2 612. Participants in the Yoga intervention arm had 37%greater odds of achieving abstinence than theparticipants in the Wellness arm. A signi cant dose-response relationship was observed for Yoga (OR , 1.12, 95% CI, 1.09% to 1.26%), but not Wellness, such that each Yoga class attended increased odds of quitting at end of treatment by 12%. The authors concluded that Yoga seems to increase the odds of successful smoking abstinence, particularly among light smokers ( 10 cigarettes/ day). Wimberly et al 18studied the effect of hatha yoga for stress and substance use among 73 people(yoga = 37, TAU = 36) living with HIV in reentry from prison. At 3 months, yoga participantsreported less stress ( P<.05) and fewer days of sub- stance use ( P<.001) than participants in the con- trol group receiving treatment as usual (case management, recreational or General Educational Development (GED) classes, and free health care) as seen in Table 2. The authors concluded that yoga interventions could provide a complementary treatment option for citizens returning from prison and experiencing HIV and substance use. Sharma et al 19determined yoga and recreational activity as an avenue to prevent criminal propensity among 30 men (15 to 35 years) with substance use disorder. After 10 weeks, the ndings revealed that there was a signi cant difference ( P<.05) in all the treatment groups (group 1 = yoga; group 2 = recrea-tional activity) when compared with the control group (no intervention), as seen in Table 2. The adjusted mean values of recreational activity (group 2) were found to be the least, indicating that this group was considered the most effectivetreatment group in reducing criminal propensity among individuals with substance use disorder. It was concluded that yoga and recreational activ- ities have signi cant effect on lowering criminal propensity. Sarkar et al 20evaluated the effectiveness of a brief community outreach tobacco cessation inter-vention (including yogic breathing) in 1213 ran- domly selected people (mean age of 46.3 613.6 years) in India (refer to Table 1). The smoking ces-sation rate at 6 months post-intervention was found higher in the intervention group than in the control group (risk ratio [RR], 5.32; P<.05). Intention-to- treat analysis showed that the participants in the yoga group were 5 times more likely to be in absti- nence at 6 months than those in the control group. The authors concluded that a single session of com- munity outreach intervention could increase 968JABFM September -October 2021 Vol. 34 No. 5 http://www.jabfm.orgcopyright. on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Description of the Interventions and Their Results Study Intervention Conclusion Lyons, Thomas et al (2019)156 weeks; 1 session/wk; 70 minutes each. Each session began with mindful movement/ stretching/chair yoga exercises (5 minutes), amindfulness meditation exercise and discussion (;40 minutes), and an exercise applying mindfulness to everyday life and high drug relapse risk situations ( ;30 minutes). Control: Texas Christian University 's Mapping- Enhanced Counseling Manuals for AdaptiveTreatment compiled into a 6-weekCommunication Skills curriculum.Anxiety, PTSD symptoms, and cravings declined, and mindfulness increasedsignicantly in both treatment arms. After controlling for the Freiburg test, there was signicant improvement ( P<.05) in the scores for participants in the intervention arm. Uebelacker, L. A. et al (2019) 16Yoga: breathing and asana (no meditation) 1 hour; 12 weeks, 1 class/week Control: Health education-12 classes on different topicsParticipant mood improved pre-class to post- class, with greater decreases in anxiety andpain for those in the yoga group ( P<.05). ITT analysis of high-attenders only (a littleover half the sample) showed moderate improvement in pain interference over 3 months in intervention arm if they attendedat least half of the 12 intervention sessions. Bock, Beth C. (2019) 17Classes included 5 minutes of pranayama,45 minutes of dynamically linked asanas, and 5 to 10 minutesof resting meditation. Group Wellness: videos, lectures, and demonstrations on a variety of health topics followed by a discussion guided by the study Wellness counselor or other health careprofessional; 8 weeks (1 hour, twice/wk)Yoga appears to aid some smokers during quit attempts. A signi cant dose effect was observed for Yoga (OR, 1.12, 95% CI,1.09% to 1.26%), but not Wellness, suchthat each Yoga class attended increased quitting odds at EOT by 12%. Wimberly, Alexandra S. et al (2018) 1812 weeks; 90 session/wk; hatha yoga: breathing, postures, and meditation; TAU *- case management, recreational or GED classes, and free healthcare.At three months, yoga participants reported less stress than participants in treatment asusual ( P<.05). Yoga participants reported fewer days of substance use than participants in treatment as usual at one month, two months, and three months ( P<.001). Sharma, Neelam et al (2017)19Physical poses, breathing techniques, chanting, and concentration were selected activities in the yoga training program. (10 weeks, 5 1-hour sessions/wk) Recreational activity training program: cat and mice, changing seats, singing, drop the handkerchief etc.There exists a signi cant difference in the selected training program of yoga,recreational activity, and control group for managing criminal propensity of the drugaddicts ( P<.05).

Dhawan et al21measured the effectiveness of a yogic breathing intervention on quality of life(QOL) of 84 male participants (study group = 55,control group = 29) dependent on opioids. The mean age of the study and control group was 39.2610.4 and 37.0 69.6 years, respectively. All 4 QOL domain scores, assessed using WHO Qualityof Life (QOL) brief scale, were signi cantly higher at 6-month follow-up period. There was a signi - cant increase in the intervention group 's physical, psychosocial, and environment domains, while the control group showed signi cant changes in the social relationship domain only. They concluded that Sudarshan kriya yoga was a bene cial low-cost and low-risk adjunct therapy for improving QOLin substance treatment settings. Reddy et al 22investigated the effect of yoga intervention on alcohol and drug misuse risk in 38 (yoga = 20, control = 18) veteran and civilian women (mean age, 44.4 612.4) with post-traumatic stress disorder. The mean scores for alcohol use disorder identi cation test (AUDIT) and Drug Use Disorders Identi cation Test (DUDIT) decreased in the yoga group; in the control group, mean AUDIT score increased, and mean DUDIT scoreremained constant. 69% in the yoga group reported fewer PTSD symptoms, and 92% reported coping better with symptoms ( P<.001). Risk of Bias Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2)14was used for quality review and assess the risk of bias in the eligible studies. Overall, 6 out of8 studies showed low concerns, while 2 studies showed some concerns about the risk of bias judg- ment (Table 3). One study had some concerns about the risk of bias owing to the lack of informa- tion on the randomization process and missing out- come data. Another study had a concerning risk ofbias due to assignment to intervention, and the analysis used to estimate the effect of the assignment. Discussion Yoga has been used as a treatment for many health-related issues. 23This systematic review aimed to review up-to-date evidence and signi cant results from randomized trials conducted across the globe.The results showed that the studies included in this systematic review were undertaken mainly in the United States and India. Two eligible studies hadundened substance use, while the others were focused on tobacco, alcohol, or opioids. Some stud-ies reported HIV or PTSD as a comorbidity in the sample population, while the others did not describe any concomitant health condition. Sevenof the 8 studies showed signi cant results and improved outcomes in anxiety, pain, or substanceuse. The studies included in this review were limited to randomized controlled trials to increase the in- ternal validity of the results 24and provide compre- hensive and reliable evidence for yoga as therapy in patients with substance use disorder. As shown in Table 2, studies showed yoga used as an interven- tion independently or as an adjunct to the other treatment plan improves outcomes. The interven- tions included Hatha yoga, Sudarshan Kriya yoga,Table Shivani et al (2014)2212 Kripalu-based Hatha yoga sessions of 75 minutes each, including poses using guidelines for trauma-sensitive yogaLinear mixed models showed signi cance for null model likelihood ratio tests for AUDITand DUDIT scores. Change in AUDIT and DUDIT scores over time did not differ signicantly by group. The difference in high-risk users between intervention andcontrol groups was not statistically signicant (all P>.05).

Hatha yoga is the practice of yoga postures along withbreathing and meditation. 25Sudarshan kriya yoga, on the other hand, involves rhythmic cyclicbreathing. 26 The primary outcomes were measured using standardized and validated surveys for data collec-tion such as AUDIT, 27and DUDIT,28SAFTEE,29 QOL,30and others. Although most of the studies were able to show signi cant results, lack of blind- ing in most of the studies was a limitation leadingto low or some risk of bias. 31Seven out of the 8 studies showed signi cant positive outcomes using yoga in conjunction with other pharmacologicaltreatment modalities like opioid substitution ther-apy. Most studies failed to report any adverse event. Although adverse events from RCTs have mini- mum implications in the real world, not reportingsuch events may question the safety of the intervention. Globally, SUD is a major public health concern and has placed a signi cant economic burden on so- ciety. 2In the United States, costs associated with alcohol and other drugs total over $400 billion due to lost workplace productivity, health care costs,law enforcement, and other criminal justice costs. 3,4 CAM has been shown to be a cost-effective treat-ment modality compared with conventional therapyalone in many medical conditions. 32Yoga, in par- ticular, is a low to no-cost treatment option for patients. It has been shown to be a cost-effectivetreatment option for chronic back pain 33and other musculoskeletal conditions.34The use of inexpen- sive alternative treatments, like yoga, as an adjunct treatment for substance use disorder may help lower the rising health care costs. Limitations This review had some limitations. Some relevantstudies might have been excluded due to the chosenstudy design. Including randomized controlled tri- als in a review provides higher internal validity, but they are less generalizable than other study designs. 35In addition, data from the studies pub- lished in languages other than English were not included. Lastly, this review lacks measurement of the strength of association between the interven- tions and the outcomes. A meta-analysis in the future can provide a quantitative estimate of the effect of yoga as a treatment intervention. Conclusion Most of the studies included in this review hadlarger sample sizes than a similar review publishedTable 3.
