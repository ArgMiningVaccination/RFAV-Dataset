The goal of radiation therapy is to kill cancer cells without harming the surround- ing healthy tissue. More than half of all people with cancer undergo some form ofradiation therapy as a part of their treatment plan. Offered at the Shoreline RadiationOncology Center, external beam radiation therapy is the most widely used type ofradiation therapy. The Shoreline Center offers Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy,Three Dimensional Radiotherapy, as well as conventional radiotherapy. \"This type of outreach program is a model of success for Yale Cancer Center. I expect to not only continue to deliver the best patient care in Guilford, but look for-ward to offering more clinical research and educational opportunities to our patientsand families in the years to come, \" Dr. Roberts said. In addition to the Radiation Oncology Center, services at the Yale-New Haven Shoreline Medical Center for area residents include patient support groups, ambula-tory surgery, diagnostic imaging, a hospital pre-admission office, laboratory medicineand blood work station, nuclear medicine testing, pathology services, and a nutritioncenter. In addition, an emergency services satellite, affiliated with Yale-New HavenHospital's Emergency Medicine Department, can triage and care for adults and chil-dren with emergency illnesses or injuries. In collaboration with Dr. Roberts, Dr. Joseph Colasanto, Assistant Professor of Therapeutic Radiology, and Dr. Susan Higgins, Associate Professor of TherapeuticRadiology, also care for patients at the Shoreline Radiation Oncology Center.

Yale Cancer Center hasexpanded its program to include newtechniques in transplantation, creat-ing more opportunities for patientswho would otherwise be ineligiblefor transplantation. In an effort to destroy abnormal, cancerous cells in leukemia, lym-phoma, and multiple myeloma,stem cell transplants are often used.The technique requires high dosesof chemotherapy and radiation to killthe cancerous cells in the patient's patients in consultation and has served patients during over 4,800treatment visits in the first year. \"The ability to offer external beam radiotherapy in Guilford hasbeen extraordinarily convenient forthose patients who live or work inthe Shoreline area and the feedbackwe have received has beenextremely positive. Radiation oncol-ogy in Guilford is completely inte- grated with Yale Cancer Center and Yale-New HavenHospital. From the patient's perspective, the transfer ofcare from inpatient to outpatient is completely seam-less,\" Dr. Roberts explained. Like its flagship location in New Haven, the Shoreline Radiation Oncology Center uses a CT/simulator for pre-cise treatment volume localization and delivers radiationtreatments using a state-of-the-art linear accelerator. Inaddition to external beam radiation therapy treatments,full clinic services are also available including patient con-sultations and follow-up visits for patients who havecompleted their prescribed course of radiation therapy. The ability to offer external beam radiotherapy in Guilford has beenextraordinarily convenient forthose patients who live or workin the Shoreline area and thefeedback we have received hasbeen extremely positive. body followed by an infusion of donor stem cells to the blood-stream. The newly introduced stemcells then reproduce, replacing theeliminated cancer cells and rebuild-ing the immune system. There are three obstacles to overcome to achieve a successfulstem cell transplantation: the iden-tification of a compatible donor; thepatient's ability to withstand thehigh doses of chemotherapy andradiation prior to the transplant; andthe avoidance of graft-versus-hostdisease, which occurs when thepatient's body is attacked by thenewly introduced stem cells.Researchers at Yale Cancer Centerare actively investigating new andinnovative solutions to these hur-dles in an effort to make stem celltransplants a treatment option for a larger number of patients. Currently, Yale Cancer Center is the only facility in Connecticutoffering allogeneic transplanta-tions, a transplant using donatedstem cells. Moreover, the Centerhas expanded treatment optionsthrough clinical trials using hap-loidentical and non-myeloablativetransplantations. New opportunities are available for patients who have not been suc-cessfully matched with a donor andare at high risk for relapse.

This multidisciplinary pro-gram promises to offer state-of-the-art care for those suffering from lung cancer. James J. Lee, MD, PhD Dr. James J. Lee, Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Section of Medical Oncology, is a key memberof the Gastrointestinal Cancer Program at Yale Cancer Center andbrings specific expertise in liver cancer to the program. \"The addition of Dr. Lee to the Gastrointestinal Cancer Program at Yale Cancer Center will give greater strength to theongoing clinical research initiatives, creating increased treatmentoptions for our patients through clinical trials, \" Dr. Richard Edelson, Director of Yale Cancer Center, explained. A graduate of the Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea, Dr. Lee earned his PhD degree at The Johns Hopkins UniversitySchool of Medicine. He completed his Internal Medicine residency training at the Long IslandJewish Medical Center before continuing on to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to completea fellowship in Medical Oncology. At the NCI, he focused his research on the development ofnew anti-cancer drugs for breast cancer, and has been involved in clinical development of anepothilone, a new generation of microtubule stabilizing agents. Kenneth Miller, MD Dr. Kenneth Miller, Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Section of Medical Oncology has been named theDirector of Supportive Care Programs at the Center. Dr. Miller is anexperienced physician who has focused his career on providing sup-portive care for cancer patients and will work to develop innovativeclinical programs for both the inpatient and outpatient settings. A graduate of Tufts University School of Medicine, Dr. Miller completed his internship and residency at Yale School ofMedicine before going to the National Institutes of Health, wherehe completed a fellowship in Hematology. He continued his train- ing at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center as a Clinical Fellow in Medical Oncology. Dr. Miller is nationally known for his knowledge of patient survivorship issues and has been an invited speaker at cancer centers throughout the country addressing the topicWalking in our Patients' Shoes - The Role of Empathy in Medicine. Prior to joining Yale, Dr. Miller served as the Associate Medical Director of the Connecticut Hospice. In 1993, he wasawarded the Physician Recognition Award from the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship. In addition to his role of Director of Supportive Care Programs at Yale Cancer Center, he will serve as Medical Director of the proposed Connecticut Challenge AdultSurvivorship Clinic scheduled to be launched late in 2006. Haploidentical transplantations allow patients to be transplanted with mismatched or half-matched donor stem cells from a family member with whom theyhave only one haplotype in common. These trans-plants use an increased or \"mega dose\" of trans-planted stem cells to enable the success of a mis-matched transplant. Dr. Stuart Seropian, Associate Professor of Medicine, Medical Oncology, is leading a clinicaltrial to offer non-myeloablative or reduced intensitytransplants to patients at Yale Cancer Center. Thetechnique uses a less intense treatment to preparea patient for transplant and alternatively relies onthe donor's immune cells combined with neweragents to fight the cancer. The ability to reduce the intensity of the trans- plant preparations has given patients who previous-ly would not be considered for transplant a newopportunity. Standard allogeneic transplants are typ-ically reserved for patients under the age of 55; ofthe 42 reduced intensity transplants done at YaleCancer Center, 75% of the patients were over 55. \"This is a new option for patients whose age would preclude standard therapy. We have cared forseveral patients who have had successful transplantsin their seventies, \" Dr. Seropian said. The third obstacle for transplant patients, graft- versus-host disease, is a common side effect of allo-geneic transplants. \"Graft-versus-host disease isthe holy grail of stem cell transplants \u2014 How do youget the good results without the badreaction?\"asked Warren Shlomchik, MD, PhD,Associate Professor of Medicine, Medical Oncologyand Associate Professor of Immunobiology. Shlomchik has focused his research on developing methods to eliminate the development of graft-ver-sus-host disease in allogeneic transplants, and he dis-covered that dendritic, or immune, cells were neces-sary in causing graft-versus-host disease. Research has shown that the deletion of T cells from the donor stem cells removes the incidence of graft-ver-sus-host, but may also decrease the effectiveness ofthe transplant. Recently receiving a Rapid Access toIntervention Development (RAID) grant from theDepartment of Health and Human Services to supporthis work, Dr. Shlomchik will investigate the induction ofmemory T cells in allogeneic transplants, which havebeen shown not to induce graft-versus-host disease. In clinical studies that she pioneered, Dr. Francine Foss, Professor of Medicine, Medical Oncology, andAssociate Director of the Hematologic MalignanciesProgram, has reduced the development of graft-versus-host disease in patients from the average of 40-50 per-cent to only 15 percent with the introduction of intra-venous infusions of autologous immature dendritic cellsbefore an allogeneic transplant. These findings have ledto the initiation of two NCI-sponsored clinical trials toconfirm these results in patients with lymphoma. \"The scientific advances in allogeneic transplants over the last several years have dramatically improvedour ability to offer cancer patients new treatmentoptions and options not offered at other facilities inConnecticut, \" Dr. Dennis Cooper, Professor of Medicine, Medical Oncology, and Director of the StemCell Transplantation Program, explained. \"The number of allogeneic transplants performed at Yale Cancer Center has doubled in the last four yearswith the introduction of techniques such as non-mye-loablative and haploidentical transplantations. Our goalis to continue to make new options available topatients at Yale Cancer Center, \" Dr. Cooper said.CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1Yale Cancer Center Welcomes Four New Oncologists Over 200 riders showed their dedication to cancer survivors in the state by participating in the first annual Connecticut Challenge Bike ride, anevent to raise money to fund Connecticut's first adult survivorship clinic.The event, which raised over $250,000 in its inaugural year, was a cul-mination of many hours of hard work by volunteers led by Jeff Keith andJohn Ragland, Co-Directors of the Connecticut Challenge (CTC) and BikeAcross America (BAA). The leadership of Bike Across America has allocated the proceeds from the annual event to establish The Connecticut Challenge AdultSurvivorship Clinic at Yale Cancer Center to address the needs of cancersurvivors. The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2000 therewere nearly 10 million cancer survivors in the United States. The newclinic will provide screening for long-term consequences resulting from cancer treatment and information to helpsurvivors minimize or avoid future healthconcerns. \"The enthusiasm of the riders, volunteers, and supporters at this year's CTC ride wasan inspiration. Their unyielding commit-ment to support cancer survivors in thestate of Connecticut will result in special-ized care for this increasing population.We are delighted that Bike AcrossAmerica has chosen to contribute to thehigh-quality care provided at Yale CancerCenter through the creation of an adultsurvivorship clinic and continuing supportof survivorship programs,\" said Richard L.Edelson, Director, Yale Cancer Center.
