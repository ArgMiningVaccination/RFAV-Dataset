Many people suffer due to a lack of proper treatment for very preventable and/or treatable conditions (such as STIs, Cholera, respiratory infections etc...) while at the same time antibiotic resistance is becoming a formidable complication to treatment around the world. Accessible technologies for rapid, accurate screening and diagnosis allow health departments to mount effective responses, connecting patients to the right care. Much of the required technology for these tools already exists in hospital labs but require many resources like trained personnel, expensive equipment, highly processed samples, sterile conditions, and time. I am interested in adapting these technologies to make diagnostic and screening tools for health departments/ministries without these resources to still offer effective care to patients and populations dealing with infectious diseases. - Conner EarlUndergraduate Institution: Brigham Young University Graduate Department: Biomedical Engineering Research Mentor: Craig Goergen, PhD (Purdue University) Research: My research interests and ambitions are to help the pediatric patient population by using cardiovascular imaging to better characterize the complex mechanisms of disease and pathology that underly heart conditions.

Heart Rate Variability, the beat-to-beat variation in time between heartbeats, is a reliable index of the dynamic balance of the autonomic nervous system branches (sympathetic and parasympathetic). In humans, increases in HRV when exposed to alcohol stimuli have been shown to predict craving, relapse, and compulsion to drink alcohol. My work has demonstrated differences in autonomic drive between the sexes in relation to alcohol consumption, with female rat drinking related to parasympathetic measures and male rat drinking related to sympathetic measures. By establishing this model, the lab is now poised to investigate brain mechanisms that direct these cardiac responses to alcohol and reveal critical sex differences that will impart new wisdom toward personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder. My overall career goals are to practice psychiatry and further our scientific understanding of psychiatric disorders and neuroscience. - Michelle (Chu) NieseUndergraduate Institution: Grove City College Graduate Department: Microbiology & Immunology Research Mentor: Mark Kaplan, PhD Research: Current research interests involve discerning the roles that tissue resident memory T cells, particularly ones that secrete the cytokine IL-9, play in allergic airway responses. - Neal PatelUndergraduate Institution: University of Pittsburgh Graduate Department: Biomedical Engineering Research Mentor: Vitaliy L.

GS5 - Sarah BurnsUndergraduate Institution: Bowdoin College Graduate Department: Medical and Molecular Genetics Research Mentor: Reuben Kapur, PhD Research: I am interested in the factors driving cancer pathogenesis and the development of novel therapies. Previously, I investigated the mechanisms underlying the cancer predisposition syndrome neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and developed potential therapies for NF2 patients with Dr. Long-Sheng Chang and Dr. D. Bradley Welling at Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University. Studying NF2 inspired an interest in the genetic alterations that influence cancer development and progression and the aspects that make each patient's disease process unique.

Particular focus is given to rare coding variants that lead to increased AD risk. Our lab uses various genetically modified mouse models, in vitro systems, and human samples to explore these areas of interest. - John WellsUndergraduate Institution: Purdue University-Indianapolis Graduate Department: Medical and Molecular Genetics Research Mentor: Stephanie Ware, MD, PhD Research: My research in Dr. Stephanie Ware's lab regards understanding the genetic causes of heterotaxy, a syndrome caused by disturbed specification of left-right asymmetry during embryonic development. This abnormal left-right patterning leads to severe congenital heart defects as well as abdominal and/or thoracic organ abnormalities. Currently, mutations in Zinc finger of the cerebellum 3 (ZIC3) are the only known cause of X-linked heterotaxy. In one family with X-linked heterotaxy without a coding mutation in ZIC3, we identified a novel ZIC3 intronic variant predicted to result in abnormal RNA splicing of ZIC3. Therefore, we hypothesize a subset of X-linked heterotaxy cases may be caused by noncoding mutations in ZIC3 altering its RNA splicing. In addition, we hypothesize that non-coding mutations in enhancer regions controlling the expression of ZIC3 during early development may also cause X-linked heterotaxy. We are working to characterize these potential enhancer regions using multiomic approaches.

More specifically, Emma will be developing an advanced microphysiological system for pancreatic islets featuring dynamic perfusion and 3D culture to provide a pro-survival microenvironment for evaluation of beta-cell function over time. Oligomeric collagen will be used to encapsulate the islets and provide critical extracellular matrix support and signaling. Furthermore, electrochemical sensors will be integrated into this device to immediately detect hormone secretion, reducing the time and cost associated with evaluating glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. After validation of device functionality, different applications at the forefront of diabetes research will be explored.

Using 3D imaging and proteomic techniques developed in the Calve lab, Sarah Lipp studied how ECM changes in kidney development and the role of kidney stromal cells. Additional studies included investigating the implications of the presence of muscle, muscle contraction, and muscle patterning on myotendinous junction development. This information can be used to tailor tissue engineering scaffolds. - Baleigh SchulerUndergraduate Institution: Central Michigan University Graduate Research Mentor: Stacey Gilk, PhD Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of Q fever. Inside the host cell, Coxiella lives within a specialized organelle called a parasitophorous vacuole. I am working to characterize membrane contact sites between the parasitophorous vacuole and the host endoplasmic reticulum. Previous work in our lab suggests that these membrane contact sites may play a role in the manipulation of cholesterol trafficking by the pathogen. The elucidation of mechanisms by which Coxiella manipulates its host cell has the potential to yield therapeutic targets. - Ravinderjit SinghUndergraduate Institution: Georgia Institute of Technology Graduate Department: Biomedical Engineering Research Mentor: Hari Bharadwaj. PhD (Purdue University) Research: My thesis work investigated the cross-section of EEG, sensory processing, and neuropsychiatric disease. I developed novel physiological (EEG) and behavioral assessments of sensory abilities to understand sensory processing better. I also found that these novel measures of sensory processing could play a role in helping diagnose and evaluate neuropsychiatric diseases like autism spectrum disorders. I plan to become a neurologist and focus on expanding the use of EEG in the clinic. - Matthew SteinhartUndergraduate Institution: Johns Hopkins University Graduate Department: Medical Neuroscience Research Mentor: Dr. Karl Koehler Research: I am interested in developmental biology questions about the patterning of the cranial nervous system. I am currently investigating the development of inner ear sensory epithelium using human pluripotent stem cells in 3D culture. - Cyrus Takahashi Undergraduate Institution: Johns Hopkins University Graduate Department: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Research Mentor: The aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 1A subfamily of enzymes has a critical, albeit poorly defined role in cancer stem cells in several cancer types. Cancer stem cells promote disease recurrence, metastasis, and treatment resistance, representing a major challenge in cancer therapy. My research utilized small molecule ALDH1A inhibitors in conjunction with global transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses to identify pathways that could potentially link ALDH1A activity and cancer stem cell survival in a triple-negative breast cancer model. A greater understanding of cancer stem cell biology and the functional role of ALDH1A therein could aid the development of more effective cancer therapies in the future. "}
