Explore more on the [Saumya Blog](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/blog), selected top Ayurveda blogs and websites to watch. When we understand our unique pathway to a balanced life - we thrive. This concept is a central part of Ayurveda's holistic approach to health and healing. But with 5,000 years of ancient wisdom to wrap your head around, getting started can be intimidating. At Saumya Ayurveda, we provide clarity and direction by breaking your custom health plan into three foundational pillars: Food as Medicine, Ayurvedic herbs, and Ayurvedic lifestyle practices. Today, we're taking a closer look at our \"Healing Trifecta\" - and how we use the tools within these three pillars to create small shifts that radically transform your life. \"I have implemented small changes that you recommended. I'm ecstatic to report that all of my anxiety has completely disappeared. It feels like magic! I was not expecting such a speedy turnaround in my overall outlook and mental wellbeing. The best way I can describe it is feeling infinitely more balanced, which has seeped into all areas of my life - work, home, personal relationships, etc. I will keep implementing small changes and building healthy habits.\" - Saumya Ayurveda Client, Minnesota The Doshas & Personalized Treatment According to Ayurveda, everything and everyone is comprised of five elements: space, air, water, fire, and earth. These elements combine to form three basic energy properties called doshas. These foundational energies, known as Vata, Pitta, and Kapha, are the building blocks of our universe. Though we may sometimes forget it, we humans are part of the greater universe. Just as rays of sunlight are not separate from the sun, we are not separate from nature. We are nature. As such, we are made up of the same energetic elements as the world around us. While all three doshas are present in every one of us, they manifest to varying degrees. Our distinct physical, mental, and spiritual traits are the result of our unique dosha constitution. You can think of it like our energetic fingerprint - no two are the same! Ayurveda seeks to establish svastha (a state of optimal mental and physical health) by attaining and maintaining balance of the doshas. But since we all have a distinct dosha makeup, there's no single approach that works for everyone. While our individual needs might vary, we all follow the same knowledge pillars to svastha. At Saumya Ayurveda, we call these guideposts the \"Healing Trifecta.\" What is Ayurveda's Healing Trifecta? At Saumya Ayurveda, we use the \"Healing Trifecta\" to establish a framework for the key elements that move us closer to good health. Within these three knowledge pillars, there are countless tools based on 5,000 years of Ayurvedic wisdom. The hallmark of our Healing Trifecta is its specificity of treatment. Within this vast toolkit lies the best course of action for you - and it's not the same for everyone. We use the Healing Trifecta to create a clear, personalized, and manageable pathway to your most thriving, vibrant life. Food as Medicine: In Ayurveda, food is medicine. Your personalized Ayurveda food plan is tailored to your unique dosha picture, goals, concerns, and current life circumstances. Ayurvedic Herbs: Using Ayurveda's ancient wisdom, we'll use medicinal plants to target, heal, and balance specific issues and systems within your body and mind. Lifestyle Practices: Small tweaks to your daily routine can have a monumental impact. Practices like mudra, meditation, breathwork, and yoga-asana are a compass for the wisdom of life itself. Our demanding lives are the source of much of our physical, mental, and spiritual turbulence. When it comes to regaining balance, they're also one of our biggest hurdles. It's a tricky cycle: life is stressful, and it's making us sick - but we're too busy to do anything about it! The Healing Trifecta helps demystify the path back to your best self. It's a clear framework, tailored to you, designed to fit your life. And with Veena's expert guidance every step of the way, you don't have to walk it alone. \"I am very grateful for the email support! It helps with those little questions that come up and gives me confidence and inspiration!\" - Anonymous, New York [Book a free consultation with Saumya Ayurveda](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/booking-calendar/free-phone-consultation?referral=service_list_widget) Food as Medicine While Western healthcare has begun to embrace the healing power of diet, Ayurveda has long understood that food is medicine. What (and how and when) we eat can have a profound impact on our bodies, spirits, and minds. Ayurveda offers a holistic approach to diet that honors the unique needs of every individual. First off... your Food as Medicine program is not a diet In the West, we tend to think of \"diets\" in restrictive terms. Cut calories. Banish butter. Quit the carbs. Unfortunately, this mentality starves us both nutritionally and of a healthy relationship with food. We don't need more deprivation; we need more of what truly nourishes us. At Saumya Ayurveda, our Food as Medicine programs are designed to balance, heal, nourish, and satiate. Rather than cutting out the \"bad,\" we focus on the food you should include. With clear and manageable suggestions tailored to your unique needs, it's easy to weave new habits into your busy life (especially once you start feeling the benefits!). Your Food as Medicine program is tailored to you At its core, Food as Medicine is deeply personalized. Your dosha picture, current dosha state, stage of life, and even the geography where you live all influence which food choices are best for you. That's why [experienced and ongoing consultation](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/services-page) is so important. This said, Ayurveda does provide a few Food as Medicine guidelines applicable to most: Favor fresh, whole foods over highly-processed foods to support prana, the vital life force. Eating three square meals at the same time each day - with no snacking in between - helps strengthen agni (the digestive fire). Eat when you're hungry, stop before you're full. This nourishes the body without diverting more energy than necessary to digest. Dinners should be light, and eaten at least three hours before bed, so the body can focus on rest and rejuvenation while you sleep. Eat slowly and mindfully to connect fully with the energy of the food you're consuming. (We literally are what we eat, let's enjoy that perspective.) Food as Medicine and the Doshas We were all born with a unique energetic footprint, known as our prakruti. When all is well, our current doshic state, or vikruti, will be the same as our original constitution. However, disturbances to our inner and outer worlds can throw the doshas out of balance. In Ayurveda, the energetic properties of food (such as hot, moist, or oily) increase like energies in our bodies. Thus, we restore balance to the doshas by consuming foods that have the qualities opposite of the imbalance. For instance: Pitta Fiery Pitta is best balanced through naturally sweet foods like sweet fruit, most grains, squash, root vegetables, milk and ghee. The best tastes for balancing Pitta are sweet, bitter, and astringent. Sour, salty, and pungent tastes should be minimized. Vata We can counteract Vata's cold, dry, light nature with foods that are warm (both in temperature and spice), moist, and grounding (like hearty soups and healthy fats). The best tastes for balancing Vata are sweet, sour, and salty. Pungent, bitter, and astringent tastes should be minimized. Kapha To balance Kapha's cool, dense, oily nature, we should favor food that is light, dry, and easy to digest - ideally served warm or hot with invigorating herbs or spices. The best tastes for balancing Kapha are pungent, bitter, and astringent. Sweet, sour, and salty tastes should be minimized. 2. Ayurvedic Herbs Once a supportive food program is established, we'll use Ayurvedic herbal medicine to target and support specific tissues, channels, and organs. It's important to note, however, that your custom herbal protocol isn't designed to treat specific symptoms. It's designed to treat the dosha imbalance at the root of your imbalance. Rather than treating the body, mind, and spirit as separate entities, Ayurveda recognizes the interconnected nature of one's whole being. While clients may have a long list of health concerns - from poor sleep, to constipation, to menstrual pain - these seemingly unrelated issues are often tied to the same dosha imbalance. By targeting imbalances at their roots, we restore equilibrium to the whole person. Often, this results in multiple symptoms clearing up at the same time - even those which have been accepted as \"part of life.\" \"A year ago, after some lab tests, I was told I had an \"abnormal\" liver. I thought of my mother, who had died young from liver disease. Veena's Ayurveda recommendations, which included herbs and healthy foods, turned things around in less than six months. My liver was retested, and each lab result was in the \"normal\" range. This testifies to my long standing mantra: 'In Veena I Trust.'\" - Don, Golden Valley, Minnesota Common Ayurvedic Herbs Ayurvedic herbal medicine serves a range of purposes, from improving sleep, to boosting immunity, supporting the digestive and reproductive systems, and even reducing stress and anxiety. While some of these herbs are familiar pantry staples - such as cinnamon, cumin, ginger, cardamom, and turmeric - Ayurveda's knowledge of herbal energetics unlocks their capacity for targeted healing. On the other hand, the rise in popularity of Ayurvedic herbal medicine has stirred up a great deal of confusion and misinformation. There's big money in herbs, and the mainstream marketing machine has branded several lesser-known plants as \"magic cure alls.\" It's true, herbs like Shatavari, Brahmi, and Ashwagandha are powerful healers. But the wrong plant can be ineffective - or even harmful - without experienced guidance. That's why it's essential to [consult an Ayurvedic practitioner](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/services-page) before beginning any herbal protocol. A Gentle Path to Healing At Saumya Ayurveda, we take a \"less is more\" approach to herbs. Rather than overwhelming you with an apothecary of expensive supplements, we start with a gentle dose of the plants you need most. Then, we'll circle back regularly to make any necessary adjustments. Your herbal needs change based on your response to treatment, changes in your life, and the seasons. This makes ongoing care an important part of your Ayurvedic journey. If it's been awhile since your last visit, [book a follow up](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/book-a-follow-up) to align your protocol with your current reality. 3. Lifestyle Practices The final pillar of our Healing Trifecta consists of Ayurvedic lifestyle practices. While this phrase can make us a little anxious, it doesn't mean waking up at four a.m. every day for an hour of silent meditation (though if that works for you, great!). Rather, these 5000-year old lifestyle tools help us tap into the meditative flow of life. What are Ayurvedic lifestyle practices - and why do they work so well? We have countless habits that make up our daily routines. We wake and sleep. We move from place to place. We eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We breathe. These habits are the key to our wellbeing - and how we do them matters. We don't need dramatic cleanses or overhauls to radically transform our lives. With Saumya Ayurveda, you'll learn effective, easy ways to optimize your energy (prana) and focus (concentration dharna) so you can experience more vitality throughout your day. Time tested practices like [breathwork](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/learn-diaphragmatic-breathing-and-change-your-life), [meditation](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/guided-practices), and [yog-asana](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/service-page/ayurveda-yoga-meditation-consultation?referral=book_button_widget) help keep us centered, so we can navigate our lives with greater balance, clarity, focus, and vitality. Paired with Ayurveda guidance around how we eat, sleep, and exercise, we begin to build a nourishing daily rhythm known as dinacharya. \"The energies present ebb and flow throughout the day and night. What happens \"out there\" influences our inner experience; this is part of the unity of all things. Through dinacharya, we create a supportive [ daily rhythm](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/ayurvedic-morning-routine-6-rituals-for-a-calm-and-centered-day) that brings our natural energies into harmony with the world around us - so we can step into the flow!\" - Veena, Saumya Ayurveda [Learn more about Ayurvedic Lifestyle Practices ](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/blog/categories/ayurvedic-routines-rituals) Ayurvedic lifestyle practices aren't about overhauling your daily routine or restricting \"bad\" habits. They're about relaxing into a balanced way of living that doesn't feel like work. As a monk and meditation teacher, Veena weaves this guidance into every session and every course of treatment - so you can lay lasting foundations for a spiritually fulfilling lifestyle. There is a saying, \"The mind is more in the body, than the body is in the mind.\" The Saumya 3 step meditation process shifts us from fight-flight-freeze mode, to rest-restore-relax mode. Give it a try for forty days and observe the changes. The more grounded and relaxed we are, the smoother life flows. \"The breath is the connection between the mind and body, so by training the breath, we become calm, focused, and grounded, we slow down the aging process by decreasing stress. These practices are so simple and easy to have as part of our daily life. We actually feel and look younger.\" - Veena, Saumya Ayurveda 1. [Learn Diaphragmatic Breathing and Change Your Life](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/learn-diaphragmatic-breathing-and-change-your-life). When we re-learn to breath diaphragmatically, we move from the flight-fight-freeze mode, to rest, restore, relaxation mode from where we want and need to live. 2.
