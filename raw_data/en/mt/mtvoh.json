Don't need the accessible version of this site? Traditional Chinese medicine is based on the philosophy that the constant flow of energy through channels called meridians needs to stay in balance to maintain health. When the flow of energy is blocked, an imbalance will occur. Acupuncture therapy will release blocked energy. Here at Spine & Health Institute, we use the AcuGraph Digital Meridian Imaging System to determine your meridian energy flow levels with a focus on the neuromusculoskeletal system. Our qualified and helpful staff will work with you to ensure that there is no more energy blockage and make sure that you are receiving all of the amazing benefits from acupuncture. 7400 Blanco Road Ste 125 San Antonio, TX 78216, US "}
