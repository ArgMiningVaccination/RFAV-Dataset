Really you are! Putting good food in your mouth is one of the most personally and socially responsible things you can do. Not only does it impact your health (and demonstrates the highest form of self-care) but it affects those around you. You are modelling behaviour either way, so while you're on your path to wellness, you might as well make positive choices that can ripple through your family, co-workers and beyond. Eat a whole food diet Eat real food. Stuff that looks, smells and sounds like food. No processed foods or anything with ingredients that you don't understand. No food additives! Avoid pesticides Eat organic as much as possible. Especially avoid the dirty dozen. Eat rainbows Make 50% of your diet fruits and veggies. Not only do a lot of fruits and veggies in your diet have their own benefits, but they also crowd out other unfavorable foods. For omnivores If you eat meat, buy local organic grass fed meat or wild game. And eat only wild caught fish (no canned tuna or farmed salmon). - Red meat no more than once per week. - At least 3 vegan dinners per week. - Consider eating completely gluten-free vegan before 5pm. Dietary sources of antioxidants Antioxidants are vitally important to keep us healthy and young! They are easy to incorporate into your diet once you know where to find them. - Fruits and veggies of all colours - Fresh veggie juice [Turmeric milk](http://wellnessmama.com/223/turmeric-tea-recipe/)with black pepper - Antioxidant rich super foods: aim for 3 of these AT LEAST per day - Pomegranate, blueberry, goji berries, clove, cinnamon, oregano, cumin, parsley, basil, ginger, thyme, ALL herbs (fresh or dried), pumpkin seeds, chia, dark chocolate/cacao, red wine, brazil nuts, hemp hearts, coconut oil, rooibos teas, nutritional yeast, seaweed...
