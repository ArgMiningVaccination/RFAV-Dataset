I emailed over the weekend and called and Dr. Gwin, the person I wanted to speak with, was out of town. However, Eric, the Co-director, put us in touch with Bev and she came in on her day off to accommodate our schedule to do some craniosacral therapy. Eric even contacted me to be sure that appointment was going to work. All more than I would have expected! We arrived and just upon entering, felt the tensions beginning to leave. The atmosphere is so supportive! We also decided to take an infrared sauna and \"whole body vibration therapy,\" which I had never tried. I highly recommend both! Most of all, I recommend the practitioners. This is a true gold mine! THANK YOU! KWRH Radio The practitioners are highly skilled and work together to create a full range of modalities under one roof.
