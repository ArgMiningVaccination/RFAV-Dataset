Oklahoma Human Services is for Oklahomans Oklahoma Human Services helps more than one million Oklahomans each year across a wide range of services including food assistance, child support, child care, reporting abuse, disabilities services and caretaker needs among others. Oklahomans help each other. It's in our nature. Oklahoma Human Services exists to make sure that when a person falls on hard times, they have a place to turn. Where we do not offer a program or assistance for a specific situation, we are committed to connecting the person in need with an organization that can help. Be A Neighbor Network Be a Neighbor is a new resource from Oklahoma Human Services that connects Oklahomans in need with local non-profits that can help. Through the Be A Neighbor portal, you can search specific need (food, child care, etc) and find organizations in your local community that you can reach out to directly for support. Oklahomans can find local non-profits that help their specific needs. Non-profit organizations become more visible to people in their local communities Volunteers find impactful work, close to home "}
