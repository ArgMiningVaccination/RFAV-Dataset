In either case, the remedy should not be exposed to strong odors or heat. Since the remedy is a \"signal\" for your body, you may be given one high potency dose (a strong \"signal\") or a repeated low potency dose (a weaker, but repeated \"signal\"), or both. The entire packet of high potency pellets should be dumped directly in the mouth all at once, under the tongue, and away from having anything else in the mouth. The repeated low potency pellets or drops should be taken at the frequency prescribed, under the tongue, and away from having anything else in the mouth. It is also best not to handle the pellets, so dump the pellets into the cap of the vial and then directly in the mouth. Ideally you should have nothing in the mouth 30 minutes before and after taking the medicine, including food, liquid, gum, candy, toothpaste, etceteras. The remedy should also be taken at a time well away from other medications. | |Antidotes... | | The homeopathic remedy is extremely dilute and your response to it can be upset or antidoted by several factors, leading to a relapse of your symptoms. In a general sense, anything to which you are sensitive is likely to antidote the remedy, so those things should be avoided as much as possible while under homeopathic care. The following is a list of things which antidote most remedies and should be avoided by all patients: - Any substance to which the patient is particularly sensitive, is a possible antidote. - Camphor, menthol, and other strong aromatic substances are strong antidotes and should be avoided. Camphor or menthol is in Ben-gay, Vicks, Noxema, Tiger Balm, Chapstick, some cough drops, and many other liniments and cosmetics. Eucalyptus, Tea tree oil, peppermint and other essential oils are in many natural medicines, teas, and candies. It's best to read the ingredients before using or taking any item. We carry some non-antidoting alternative toothpaste and gum for your convenience. - Drugs that are not absolutely necessary can interfere. Other homeopathic medicines and most over-the-counter drugs should be avoided. Some medicines that are not dangerous to discontinue and are a particular problem with homeopathic treatment (like topical steroids) may need to be discontinued before undergoing homeopathic treatment. In most cases, we recommend you stay on prescription medications and we will \"work around\" them if we must. If eventually you feel well enough and want to discontinue the drugs, you must work with the person who prescribed the drug to establish a protocol for getting off of it. - Surgery and Dental work should not be avoided if necessary, but you should notify your homeopathic practitioner if you need to have procedures done. |Patience...| | | You may have wondered why the terms patience and patients are so much alike. Homeopathic treatment is one excellent reason. Your body will undoubtedly take time to heal itself when given the proper \"signal\". In most cases, when under only homeopathic care, you will be re-evaluated in several weeks to months. If we perceive things to be heading in the proper direction, then you may be asked to wait for an additional amount of time. Only if progress has stalled, or a relapse has occurred, will you be given another dose of the same remedy, or a different remedy. The action of the homeopathic remedy can be astoundingly effective and deceptively subtle, so your patience and self-observation may reap great reward. | |What to Expect After Taking a Homeopathic Remedy... | | Just as every individual will have a different condition which brings them to seek help from a practitioner of homeopathy, every individual will experience a different effect from homeopathic therapy. The following are just a few of the questions that people may have after taking a homeopathic remedy with answers to those concerns. Of course, the person best suited to evaluate a patient's response to the remedy is the practitioner who prescribed the remedy. The following are merely some guidelines and encouragement for homeopathic patients who may be concerned about the course of their treatment. - What if my symptoms get worse after taking the homeopathic remedy? If the same symptoms you have been experiencing worsen, or symptoms that you have experienced previous to treatment return, fear not. It is extremely common that homeopathic therapy will cause an aggravation of symptoms before the symptoms improve. A short aggravation is actually a beneficial sign, since it often indicates that the practitioner has probably selected the proper remedy, and profound improvement is likely to follow. Only if the symptoms are severe and prolonged or life-threatening, will an experienced homeopathic practitioner recommend altering or intervening with the therapy. Otherwise, virtuous patience is likely to reap great reward. - What should I do if I think I was exposed to an antidoting factor? Antidoting a remedy is much less common than most vigilant patients expect that it might be. Of course, it is best to be cautious to avoid the factors which are commonly known to antidote remedies, but if by accident you are exposed to a known antidoting factor, the best course of action is to be self-observant for the return of any symptoms. If symptoms return, it is best to contact your practitioner and let them know what is happening. Often a patient with a strong vital force will recover from an antidoting influence without needing another dose of the remedy, so the practitioner may ask you to wait for a period of time before checking in again. Once again, patience will be virtuous. - What should I do if I think my symptoms may be returning (relapsing)? It is important for your homeopathic practitioner to know about and have the chance to evaluate any suspected relapse. In most cases, an experienced practitioner will not jump to repeat a remedy until a full relapse is confirmed. Repeating even the same exact dose too soon can completely disrupt a case and cause a relapse from which is difficult to recover. So once again, if your practitioner gives no medicine and asks you to wait, be assured that they are actually acting in your best interest. Occasionally you may be given a dose of a remedy to hold onto, and asked to repeat the remedy only upon experiencing a full relapse or checking in with your practitioner. It is imperative that you follow these directions explicitly to avoid complicating your problems. - What if I feel nothing while on a homeopathic medicine? If you sense nothing from a homeopathic prescription, there are three common possibilities. The first possibility is that, though homeopathic medicine is incredibly powerful, it is also often deceptively subtle. You may well be making progress which is perceptible to your homeopathic doctor, or those around you, but you are not seeing it from your biased point of view. The surest way to determine your progress is to have a follow-up appointment with your homeopath. The second possibility is that an incorrect remedy was chosen. Given that there are literally thousands of remedies from which to choose, this is a distinct possibility. The third possibility is that the wrong potency of the correct remedy was used. The surest way to correct the second and third possibilities is to follow-up with your practitioner, disclose any information that may have been omitted or withheld before, and continue to have patience. - What if I develop new symptoms that I have never had before? This infrequent occurrence should be relayed to your homeopathic doctor as soon as possible, especially if the symptoms persist or the homeopathic medicine is being repeated. Homeopathic medicine has little or no side-effects, but repeating a remedy can infrequently lead to a \"proving\", in which the patient develops symptoms common to those needing the remedy. If the symptoms are the result of a proving, they will rapidly disappear when the remedy is discontinued upon your homeopathic practitioner's advice. - What if my problems continue to get progressively worse? Consider that this may be an aggravation from the proper homeopathic remedy, which will soon be followed by improvement. Only your homeopathic practitioner and an adequate amount of time (which will vary depending upon the condition) can determine whether the symptoms are an aggravation or that the wrong remedy or potency was selected. Of course, prolonged or life-threatening aggravation or disease progression should be reported to you homeopathic doctor as soon as "}
