The study, which was published Friday in the peer-reviewed medical journal [JAMA Network Open](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2785388?utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_term=102221), analyzed patients who contracted COVID-19, not people who only received the COVID-19 vaccine. The most common cognitive deficits the study identified were memory encoding and memory recall, which showed up in 24% and 23% of the participants, respectively. [Memory encoding](https://www.simplypsychology.org/memory.html) is the process of storing sensory input as a memory, such as storing a phone number in your head by repeating it out loud a few times. [Memory recall](https://www.simplypsychology.org/memory.html) refers to accessing memories that are stored already and retrieving them for use. The study used the [Hopkins Verbal Learning Test](https://www.parinc.com/Products/Pkey/130) to show participants a series of words in different categories and see how many they could recall. Another test, called the [Number Span test](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/digit-span#:~:text=Digit%20Span%20Forward%20requires%20the,that%20presented%20by%20the%20examiner.), would see how many digits someone could recall from memory after seeing the numbers on a screen.

An example of phonemic fluency is asking participants to come up with as many words that start with a \"C\" as possible, and category fluency involves asking them to list words related to a category, such as animals, according to [Oxford's Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology](https://academic.oup.com/acn/article/30/5/448/5478). Hospitalized patients were much more likely than non-hospitalized patients to struggle with attention, executive functioning, category fluency, memory encoding and memory recall. Another study that documented \"brain fog\" was published by Oxford University and the National Institute for Health Research study earlier in October. Cognitive symptoms were seen in about 8% of patients and were more common among the elderly. The study also found common lingering symptoms, such as trouble breathing, abdominal ailments, fatigue, pain, anxiety and depression.
