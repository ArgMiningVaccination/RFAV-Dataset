WHA TEXACTL YISCAM? In order to provide a shared basis for understanding, this article uses the domains and denitions established by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM). 2Established in the fall of 1998, NCCAM is one of 27 institutes and centers comprising the National Institutes of Health (NIH). According to NCCAM, \"complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, andproducts that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine.\" 2 Practitioners who have used and tested CAM over an extended periodmay well ask, \"What constitutes 'conventional' medicine?\" The metho ds and modalities encompassed by CAM change continually, furthermuddying the water. This is because some approaches, proven safe andeffective through well-designed scienti cstudies, are adopted into widespread use as new, untested approaches emerge. Therapeutic use ofthe herb foxglove, for example, was considered \"alternative medicine\" until its operative agent, Digitalis purpurea, was isolated and found effective in the treatment of congestive heart failure. Indeed, the historyof medicine is full of such examples.NCCAM denes conventional medicine as that practiced by medical doctors (MDs) and osteopathic doctors (DOs) along with allied healthclinicians including nurses (RNs), physical therapists (PT s), and psychologists. Complementary medicine is a therapy used in conjunction with conventional medicine; an example is the use of aromatherapy aftersurgery to lessen a patient's discomfort. Alternative medicine is used instead of conventional practice and might include a special diet prescribed totreat cancer instead of surgery ,radiation, and chemotherapy .2Integrative medicine combines CAM modalities shown to be safe and effective with conventional treatments. Alternative and complementary medicine includes comprehensive systems of medical theory and practice, as well as four therapeutic domains whichmay overlap and sometimes include conventional therapies: 2 Complete Systems of Medicine include conventional medical practices commonly used in the United States along with other systems that mayhave developed before or apart from these practices, such as homeopathic medicine, naturopathic medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, and A yurveda, as practiced in India. Biologically-Based Therapies that rely on natural substances (such as shark cartilage), dietary supplements, or botanical pro ducts. Energy Therapies that may affect bioelds :energy elds thought to surround the bo dy in which the clinician may apply pressure or interrupt these elds using qi gong, Reiki, or Therapeutic Touch; or bioelectromagnetic-based therapies using pulsed, magnetic, alternating- current, or direct-current elds. Manipulative Body-Based Practices that use manipulation or movement of one or more parts of the bo dy, such as chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation and massage. Mind-Body Medicine that uses various techniques to alleviate symptoms or enhance bo dily function through meditation, prayer, mental healing, or creative activities including art, dance, or music.Use of Complementary & Alternative Therapies in Homeless Health Care Increasing interest in holistic health care, in medical practices developed outside the western scientic tradition, and in cultural competency of health care practitioners serving diverse populations has expanded Americans' awareness of complementary and alternative approaches to the treatment and prevention ofillness. Over the last 40 years, therapeutic interventions that complement conventional medical practices or are offered as alternatives to them have attracted asigni cant following among clinicians and clients, resulting in the designation of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) as a focus of scienti c study. This issue of Healing Hands explains what is meant by CAM, describes the major theoretical systems and practices it comprises, and discusses therapies currently used by Health Care for the Homeless (HCH) practitioners\u2014including nutritional supplements, acupuncture, and mindfulness-based stress reduction\u2014and which their efcacy OF THE NETWORK2The purpose of NCCAM's Strategic Plan for 2005-2009, Expanding Horizons of Health Care, is to advance scientic understanding of CAM through the conduct and support of basic and applied research, to train CAM researchers, to disseminate health news and information, and tosupport the integration of effective CAM therapies into accepted practice. 3Patient support groups and cognitive-behavioral therapy are two techniques once considered CAM that are now mainstream therapies. Ongoing clinical research includes studies of acupuncture, herbal and botanical products, chiropractic manipulations, and various \"mind-body\" practices. A 2008 NCCAM-funded report by Ahn and colleagues substantiates the electrical properties of acupuncture points and meridians, and while not conclusive does point the way to future investigations based on their encouraging preliminary evidence.4Other research supported by NCCAM provides information and guidance on: the effectiveness ofmagnets in treating pain; 5botanicals as dietary supplements to enhance cardiovascular, cognitive and metabolic function;6and the cost- effectiveness of complementary and alternative modalities.7A 2004 study jointly funded by NCCAM and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) found that 75% of adults had tried some form of CAM, 62% ofwhom had used CAM during the previous 12 months. A national surveyconducted in 1997 estimated that Americans spent $40 billion that yearon CAM therapies, demonstrating their economic and cultural impact. 8 Health insurance coverage for CAM therapies is limited and varies bystate (http://nccam.nih.gov/health/chiropractic/#insure ). Although many state Medicaid programs provide coverage for chiropractic and somecover acupuncture, only 21% of HCH clients qualied for .bphc.hrsa.gov/uds/ 2006data/ National/homeless/NationalT able4ho.htm ). Many clinicians serving poor and homeless clients contend that complementary and alternativetherapies should be available to everyone. Connie Henry, PhD, ND, CPH, RN, CADS , works with adult men and women on smoking cessation through natural practices. A Board Certied Holistic Health Practitioner at HCH, Albuquerque, she hasworked with clients with addictions for 42 years. \"There is truly nothingbetter that the [National Acupuncture Detoxication Association's(NADA)] Acudetox protocol because it helps clients relax, reduces theirlevel of anxiety , and allows them to focus,\" says Henry. (See page 4 for more information about Acudetox.) As an adjunct to auricularacupuncture, she uses aromatherapy in her smoking cessation program,substituting different aromas that provide a pleasant sensation for stalecigarette smoke. A certied herbalist, Henry teaches clients living on the streets to make herbal sun teas using bottled water and fresh or dried medicinal herbsthat she helps them obtain. \"It's an inexpensive, hands-on opportunity to empower them,\" she says. \"They can make themselves a relaxing cup of tea to help them sleep better at night. We also teach clients to eat lots ofapples\u2014which are portable, a good source of nutrition, and providedetoxi cation for nicotine and other substances. Apples can be part of a healthful, low-cost food plan, allowing clients to do something good for themselves.\" Patricia (\"Tish\") Shull, MS, P A-C, works with homeless clients at the 12th Street Clinic HCH project in Casper , Wyoming. \"I try to alwaysCOMPLEMENTARY & ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES2 Acupuncture is a method of healing developed in China at least 2,000 years ag o. Current practice involves stimulation of anatomical points on the body by thin, solid, metallic needles that are manipulated by the clinician's hands or by electrical stimulation. Aromatherapy uses essential oils (extracts or essences) from flowers, herbs, and trees to promote health and well-being. Ayurveda is a system of medicine that originated in India over 5,000 years ag o. It includes diet and herbal remedies and emphasizes the use of body, mind, and spirit in disease prevention and treatment. Chiropractic is a system of medicine focusing on the relationship between bodil y structure (primarily the spine) and function, and how it affects the preservation and restoration of health. Manipulative therapy is the integral treatment tool. Cupping is an ancient Chinese practice to alleviate pain, respiratory diseases, and paralysis in which a heated cup is applied to the skin creating a vacuum so that skin and supercial muscle are suctioned into the cup. Red rings and bruising at the rim site are expected results; as with coining theseare not signs of physical abuse. Dietary Supplements include vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, and substances such as enzymes, organ tissues, and metabolites. These supplements come in many f orms, including extracts, concentrates, tablets, capsules, gel caps, liquids, and powders.The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994 requires special labeling of dietarysupplements, which are considered foods but are not regulated as drugs. Electromagnetic Fields are invisible lines of force that surround all electrical de vices or may be produced naturally during thunderstorm activity; magnetic elds may be produced by electric currents flowing at the Earth's core. Homeopathic Medicine is a system of medicine based on the belief that \"lik e cures like,\" in which small, highly diluted quantities of medicinal substances are given to cure symptoms which would be caused by higher or more concentrated doses of the same substances. Massage therapy involves the manipulation of muscles and connective tissues to enhance tissue function and pr omote relaxation and well-being. Naturopathic Medicine is a medical system that relies on the body's inherent healing power that establishes, maintains, and restores health. Practitionerswork with clients to support this power through treatments includingnutrition and life-style counseling, dietary supplements, botanicals, exercise, homeopathy, and practices from traditional Chinese medicine. Qi gong is a component of traditional Chinese Medicine that combines movement, meditation, and r egulation of breathing to enhance the flow of qi (vital energy) in the body, thereby improving blood circulation and enhancing immune function. Reiki means Universal Life Energy in Japanese and is based on the belief that when spiritual energy is channeled thr ough a Reiki practitioner, the client's spirit is healed, which in turn heals the physical body. Therapeutic Touch is derived from an ancient technique called laying-on of hands in which the premise is that the healing f orce of the therapist affects the client's recovery; healing is promoted when the body's energies are in balance. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) r epresents the ancient system of health car e originating in China, based on the concept of balanced qi that flows throughout the body. Qi is proposed to regulate a person's spiritual,emotional, mental, and physical balance and to be influenced by the opposingforces of yin (negative energy) and yang (positive energy). Disease is theresult of disrupted qi and imbalanced yin and yang. Modalities include herbal and nutritional therapy, restorative physical exercises, medication,acupuncture, and remedial massage.HEALING NETWORKpractice evidence-based medicine,\" she says. \"If the data support it, I'll try almost anything as long as the client can access it. But just because something sounds good and is safe doesn't mean it will work. I always ask myself, 'Will it hold up in court?' There are times when I have said to aclient, 'There is absolutely nothing that says this will work, but I'm prettycertain it won't hurt. If you want to try it, here is what you can do.' Imake sure to document that in the chart\"\u2014which is an important part of record keeping in the event of a legal dispute. 9, 10\"Some clients only want alternative or complementary therapies. Part of my job is to make sure they don't cause harm by trying them.\" 3CAM Therapies Making a Difference for HCH Clients Across the country, HCH practitioners are using a variety of complementary and alternative therapies (CAM) for their clients' benet. Some of these practices have roots in ancient systems of care while others rely oncreative strategies born of clinicians' desire to promote patient health and well-being. DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS Herbal and botanical therapies are among the alternative and complementary treatments that havecaptured public attention, but may be ofconcern to practitioners untrained in their use.For example, Echinacea is a popular herbaltherapy believed to help prevent and alleviatesymptoms of the common cold based onanecdotal reports; however , a 2005 efcacy study supported by NCCAM found nosigni cant effect on infection with the cold virus or the severity of symptoms in 437volunteers, randomly assigned to receive eitherprophylaxis or treatment with one of threeEchinacea preparations or a placebo. 11 The Mayo Clinic website ( www .mayoclinic.com ) is a comprehensive resource for clients andclinicians which describes \"Drugs and Supplements\" in detail. Each entry is dened, its use outlined, and its efcacy graded (A-F) based on scientic evidence. Dosing, safety, allergies and side effects, methodology, and selectedreferences are also included. Susan Montauk, MD , professor of Clinical Family Medicine at the University of Cincinnati and medical director of The Afnity Center , uses a number of CAM therapies with her clients. She reminds us that \"a healthful diet, adequate sleep, and exercise are all established components of good health and important especially toindividuals who are battling bipolar disorder or depression.\" To that end, she recommends melatonin for sleep disturbances, particularly withteens (see www .mayoclinic.com ), and teaches relaxation with breathing techniques and throughguided imagery, using tapes that even childrencan follow on a tape recorder. Montauk recommends Pelargonium sidoides to treat colds, a botanical therapy that is \"well- documented and can reduce symptoms by 4 or 5 days if taken within 48 hours of infection\" (see www .aafp.org/afp/20040201/tips/1.html ).12,13The product is available online and costs about $7 totreat one cold. Plain yogurt may be an inexpensive remedy for yeast infections on the skin, Montauk notes.\"The bacteria in yogurt appear to ght yeastfungi for food\u2014and win.\" NATUROPATHIC CARE Licensed naturopathic doctors (NDs) have prescriptive authority in 16 states including Arizona,Oregon, W ashington, and the District of Columbia. Central City Concern's Old T owne Clinic in Portland, Oregon, serves low-incomeand homeless people, emphasizingcompassionate care. The clinic's twonaturopathic physicians, also licensed asacupuncturists, provide auricular acupuncture asa complement to standard drug and alcoholtherapies as well as full body treatments formusculoskeletal problems, fatigue, and pain.They also prescribe herbs and botanicals fromthe onsite naturopathic pharmacy and apply physiotherapy including massage, ultrasound,cupping, and chiropractic manipulation. \"The work they do to combat chronic pain in a holistic way is wonderful,\" says Medical Director Rachel Solotaroff, MD . \"These therapies minimize problems for folks in recovery as well as for others who don't want to take narcotics.They also help hepatitis C patients who aren' t candidates for Interferon therapy with pain and other sequelae of the disease.\" Julie Anne Chinnock, ND, MPH , at Outside In, also in Portland, describes naturopathic care as individual-specic. \"It is a unique medicaltreatment plan that may include prescription drugs along with nutraceuticals [bioactive chemicals derived from foo ds but taken as supplements at much higher concentrations than diet alone could provide14] or botanicals orinformation on dietary and lifestyle modications. Each person needs to beevaluated on a case-by-case basis that considershis or her condition, comorbidities, andcontributing factors such as mental health,domicile status, alcohol or drug use. I appreciatethe patient-centered philosophy of anintegrative model that combines conventionaland alternative therapies.\" \"Our integrated pharmacy allows us to choose from a variety of products including pharmaceuticals, botanicals, nutritional supplements, multi-vitamins, ber and proteinsupplements,\" she adds. \"The naturopathicmedicines are provided through a partnershipwith the National College of NaturopathicMedicine and Multnomah County Coalition ofCommunity Clinics. We are also able to referour clients to a Reiki practitioner, Harriet Cooke, MD.\" Reiki healers use gentle, hands-on therapy to increase energy, reduce pain, and produce deep relaxation. Montauk, in Cincinnati, says that \"healingtouch can be quite effective; a skilled craniofacial therapist might spend ve minuteswith her hands over my occiput and I really feel the energy.\" According to the Harvard Heart Letter , several studies have reported positive results using such \"touch therapies\" in conjunction with standardcardiac care for patients with heart problems. Those receiving Reiki before cardiac catheterization reported feeling morecomfortable and condent; patients receivingIntegrated pharmacy, courtesy of Outside In HEALING HANDS A PUBLICATION OF THE HCH CLINICIANS' NETWORK4\"healing touch\" therapy before and after open heart surgery had shorter hospital stays.15 ACUPUNCTURE Licensed acupuncturist Jan Fadden, RN , works with Casa Esperanza Homeless Shelter in Santa Barbara, CA. \"Wholebo dy acupuncture is a useful therapy for pain with clients experiencingmusculoskeletal or gastrointestinal problems and for AIDS patients,\" she says. \"Sometimes I also use Shiatsu, which is an acupressure technique that involves pushing along the acupoints. I also follow the NADA Acudetox protocol for clients with substance use disorders. It reduces their anxiety and helps ght cravings for alcohol and other addictive drugs.\" NADA provides public education about acupuncture as a recovery tool and trains healthcare workers in its protocol(http://acudetox.com ). Fine gauge, sterilized, one-time use stainless steel needles are insertedjust under the skin at ve points on the outerear (auricle). They remain in the client's ear forup to an hour as he or she practices quietrelaxation in an upright chair. Because the NADA protocol emphasizes mobilizing the client's inherent resources, it isimportant to encourage and reinforce clientself-management efforts. Auricular acupunctureis used as an adjunct to comprehensiveaddiction treatment, which includes counseling,education, family involvement, mutual supportgroups, and supportive health services.James Keating , a client of the Baltimore HCH program, says that in addition to \"being pretty goo d at relaxing me, [acupuncture] helps me have positive feelings about myself. Normally, I'm full of negative thoughts; now my negativity is eliminated in group meetings twice a week.\" In the beginning, he says, \"I was on edge aboutthe treatment, but I kept coming, and now I feel and think differently. I can focus on positive things and no longer have cravings for drugs. And in my outside ministry, I've become an inspiration to other folks who are hurting because I'm living proof [that this treatment works].\" Diana Keener , who has a Master's degree in Acupuncture, facilitates James' group discussions at the Baltimore HCH. \"This is a stress management class based on the classical Chinese tradition. The protocol combines auricular acupuncture with meditation, whichfacilitates the action of the acupuncture,\"Keener explains. \"Anyone can attend thegroup, although the majority of participantsmay have substance use issues. We begin witha group discussion, sharing what has happenedduring the week. Then we have a brief perio d of relaxation before I insert the needles\u2014fiveneedles in each ear, corresponding to fiveorgan systems: nervous system, heart, kidney,liver, and lungs. Then the group follows aguided meditation and sits quietly for a halfhour . This therapy is intended to create a partnership between the client and clinician,\"Keener says. \"People find it very empowering,particularly disenfranchised clients like manyof our homeless folks.\" BOOKS SHAPING LIVES Donna Kelly, RN, is an outreach nurse for the Care Alliance Health Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Most days she is out in the community looking after herhomeless clients. One day a week, she runs aclinic in a shelter' s cafeteria. A big reader herself, she noticed that a number of the folks at theshelter were reading too. She'd ask what they were reading and how they liked the book. More and more, her clients would stop by and say , \"Hey, I nished that book . . .\"; often their discussion led to other issues including their health. What began as a simple point ofengagement\u2014one reader to another\u2014grew, untilone day Kelly said to her Director ofDevelopment Jenice \"Sometimes Ijust want to read with my guys.\" Jenice had just attended a workshop on Health Literacy, and she answered back, \"Donna, you can read with themwhile you're nursing\u2014we can make it happen.\"So Care Alliance initiated a collaborationbetween the Cleveland Public Library and the largest men's shelter in Cleveland. Kelly says she worried that nobody would come to the new reading project. \"But it took off and has become the best health teaching project I've ever worked with, and I've been nursing a long time.Every Monday we have a core group of 20 and we read two books a month, but many more folks are in and out, and the books circulatethrough the shelter. I often get books back from someone who got them from someone else. For people starting to get their lives together, the reading group also becomes a safe place to share some of the trauma they've been through, and the discussion helps enhance their coping skills.\" Favorite books that have launched discussion and touched readers include: Finding Fish by Antwone Q. Fisher, who has ties to Cleveland and homelessness. The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down by Anne Fadiman, which speaks to tragic problems that can arise when people fromdifferent cultures don't understand oneanother . This book sparked a wonderful ongoing discussion about how to talk tomedical providers and what a patient needsto share and also to nd out. The Pact by Sampson Davis, George Jenkins, and Rameck Hunt\u2014about three troubledteens from Newark who make a pact to go tocollege and provide mutual support throughmedical school\u2014has led to other pactsbetween readers in the group. Best of all, says Kelly , \"The guys have taken ownership of the project. They regularly go outand collect the books and have built bookshelves so that each section of the shelter(Emergency, Remission, Transitional, Sober-Working) has appropriate books. We've gottena lot of publicity and are getting many bookdonations now. Even Anne Perry, the Scottishmystery writer, is sending the guys autographed copies of her books and they just think it's great! We go to book store readings to meet other authors too.\" \"Now we've started a satellite group at another shelter and have a women and children's group,where I do basic health discussions with themoms and a volunteer reads with the kids,\"Kelly continues. \"At the National HCHConference in Phoenix, I spoke with Katie V olk, MA , director of training with The National Center on Family Homelessness(National Center), and she' s going to send me Steve Har denbergh, L.Ac, administering auricular acupuncture, courtesy of Central City ConcernHEALING HANDS A PUBLICATION OF THE HCH CLINICIANS' NETWORK5information about the PEACH materials to add to our program.\" \"PEACH stands for Physical and Emotional Awareness for Children who Are Homeless,\" Volk says. Realizing the toll homelessness takes on children, evidenced by their increasedphysical illness and mental health problems, the National Center adapted a program based on the award-winning OrganWise Guys \u00aefor use in shelter Heart\u00ae, Calci M. Bone\u00ae, Pepto the Stomach\u00ae\u2014engage children living in a shelter in a curriculum targeted at nutrition andemotional health to help them understand their bodies' reactions to stress and learn how to cope better,\" Volk says. Books, videos, and interactive activities make each character come to life. \"Using the program, I discovered one day just how engaged the children could become when Iwas going to switch to another story,\" V olk explains. \"A little boy in the front row yelled,'Where' s Hearty Heart?' So I said, 'We're going to read about something else today.' And he said, 'No, no, no!\u2014I want Hearty Heart!'\" The PEACH curriculum has 17 sessions, each lasting 45-60 minutes, and is designed to bepredictable and encourage children to feel safeand at ease. New children as well as those whoattend regularly are engaged and gain a sense ofaccomplishment and pride from the experience. THE POWER OF THE MIND \"Here at HCH Manchester in New Hampshire, we are teaching Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction(MBSR) to groups of people who are homelessthrough the health education component of ourprogram,\" says Project Director Marianne Savarese, BSN . MBSR is an evidence-based curriculum developed in 1979 by Jon Kabat-Zinn, PhD, at the University of MassachusettsMedical Center in the Stress ReductionClinic. 16It has become a form of complementary medicine\u2014not a substitute forother medical treatments\u2014to address a varietyof health concerns in over 200 medical centers,hospitals and clinics around the world,including the Duke Center for Integrative Medicine (www .dukeintegrativemedicine.org ) and the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (www .uihealthcare.com ). MBSR is an 8-week intensive training programconsisting of 2-3 hour-long sessions weekly with a full-day retreat at week 6. It focuses on mindfulness meditation that is structured tocultivate an individual's inner awareness of mind and body while learning to exclude unconscious thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that may undermine physical and psychological health. Students learn specic skills, including guided meditation and yoga practices, to help them pay attention, practice deep relaxation, and use these tools in their daily lives. Goals include connecting more fully in the present moment, appreciating life's fullness, and facilitating deep inner resources in order tocope, grow, change, and heal. Outcomes have been shown to include: 17-20 Reduced pain Increased ability to cope with chronic pain Increased ability to respond more effectively to stress Increased ability to relax Increased sense of well-being Greater enthusiasm for life Improved self-esteem Increased clarity and awareness when making choices Possible plasticity of learned mechanisms The Manchester project has adapted sessions to more easily serve its homeless clients byfollowing a 6-week cycle, which meets 1 houreach week and uses movements calledstretching instead of yoga. Other modicationsinclude briefer meditations, imagery based onfamiliar scenes, and CDs with 10 minutecontent reviews (instead of 45 minutes) and 30minutes of guided meditation (CD players areprovided). Each session has a team of leaders including a psychologist trained in MBSR, a social worker, and a substance abuse counselor. Savarese says, \"We use a ve-question quality-of-life survey before and after the training cycle,which demonstrates our client's perceived improvement.\" Clients are pleased with their progress and see the program's usefulness. \"One of our female clients is a waitress and reportedbeing stressed at work. She went into the kitchen to use her breath training to get through her day.\" Others have remarked: \"I'mamazed at being able to sit still and be quiet.\"\"I'm less angry and able to deal with mysiblings.\" \"It's teaching me to be in a differentkind of relationship to my bo dy, to be able to notice how stress affects my body.\" Shelter staff and the Manchester HCH team members have noticed that participation inMindfulness Based Stress Reduction enhancescoping skills, promotes recovery, andameliorates stress. Some clients use MBSR to: Help them go to sleep Relax and think before they act Manage anger Gain condence Deal with hectic lives and keep calm Remain in the present Breathe \"Participants report nding time to think,\" Savarese concludes. \"Indeed, time to think more clearly, to sit with the quiet, and topractice kindness and self compassion for the very rst time in their lives.\" MBSR session participants, courtesy of Manchester HCH.HEALING HANDS A PUBLICATION OF THE HCH CLINICIANS' NETWORKSOURCES & RESOURCES Communications Committee Jan Caughlan, LCSW-C (Chair); Bob Donovan, MD (Co-Chair); Sue Bredensteiner (Health Writer); Pat Post, MPA (Editor) This publication was developed with support from the Health Resources and Services Administration.
