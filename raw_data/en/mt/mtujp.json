Panama-California International Exposition ~ San Diego, 1915 n 6 PANAMA CALIFORNIA EXPOSITION NEWS D. C. COLLIER SAN DIEGO'S ~ ~ BIGGEST ASSET COL. D. C. COLLIER, President Col. D. C. Collier has been fre\u00ad quently called \"San Diego's greatest asset\", and it was one of the most prominent citizens of San Diego, and a man directly concerned with the Panama-Cali\u00ad fornia Exposition, who said in a public speech that \"Collier is worth a million dollars to San Diego\". ; ~ EIERE was no opposition whatever to the idea Wil~~ of making Collier director-general of the Pana\u00ad ~ ~ rna-California Exposition when the exposition ~ organization was in the making. Everyone in ~ San Diego seemed to hold the opinion that he was the only man who could make the exposition the great and glittering success its projectors desired it to be. In fact, it is probable that the project would not have been carried out if Collier had not been in a position to become its active head, and if he had not consented to give up his private business and take hold of its management. The very fact that Collier was enthusiastic over the project put en\u00ad thusiasm into others, and carried it safely over the shoals of its early existence. Not only are these statements true, but again, it has been President Collier who has shaped the policies of the exposition organization and defined the character of the unique exposition which San Diego proposes to hold in 1915. If there is any other man in the world with the nerve and the genius to assert that San Diego could and would hold an exposition different in every essential feature from any other exposition ever held in the world, and then to go ahead, single handedly, and work out the problems that entered into the proposition of building an absolutely unique in\u00ad ternational exposition, San Diego doesn't know that man. But San Diego does know that Collier has done these things, and before the year of 1915 shall have passed into history it is safe to say that the world will know it. It is hard now to make people believe that San Diego is going to hold an exposition that will attract the attention of the whole world, but Colonel Collier can do even that. He will do it, before he is through. Collier's biography is pretty well known to the majority of San Diegans, but he is beginning to attract a great deal of attention in many other places besides San Diego, and so it will be all right to say just a word here about what he has done, and who he is. D. C. Collier was born in a Colorado mining camp. He came of a distinguished family. His father was interested in mining, and also owned and operated several newspapers. Early in life Collier determined to hitch his wagon to his own star. He studied law, and was admitted to the bar at an early age. When the oil excitement broke out in Beau-mont, Texas, he went there, and made considerable money. Later he went to Louisiana and attempted to start an oil excitement of his own, but it petel'ed out. Collier left Louisiana poor but not discouraged. From Louisiana Collier came to San Diego and settled down. He has made San Diego his home ever since, but he is of a restless disposition, and he has ~avelled across the continent something like forty times. Between times he has improved the opportunity to acquire. a considerable amount of San Diego real estate, and has grown rich in the acquirement of the same. He has practiced law, dabbled in politics, built street railways, bought and sold real estate, and worked in a bank. And all the time he continued to boost for San Diego, until finally he grew into the greatest booster the Pacific coast has ever known, and the Pacific coast has known some great boosters. Collier owned the first automobile in San Diego, and also the first graphophone used for dictation. He has half a dozen automobiles now, and is thinking of buying an aero\u00ad plane, but the graphophone lies in its corner alone, all cov\u00ad ered with dust and busted in tone. Collier can't sit still long enough to use it to any advantage. Collier is a big man, not only physically but mentally. As the saying is, he would be noticed anywhere in a crowd. And this is not altogether because of the peculiarities of his dress, although he always wears a soft shirt and collar, even when he goes to call on the President at the White House, and he always wears a broad-brimmed soft hat. He never wears suspenders. He generally wears a smile. JOSEPH W. SEFTON, JR. Acting Director-General PANAMA CALIFORNIA EXPOSITION NEWS 7 Character of the Exposition WINFIELD HOGABOOM, Director of Publicity The Director of Publicity is Win\u00ad field Hogaboorn, a California news\u00ad paper man trained to the work he has undertaken. HE ''outside'' feature of the Panama-California Exposition is to be its Mission architecture. This will be one of the many unique features of an exposition wholly unique. There is no architecture in the world precisely like that which the mission fathers of early California used for their edifices. It was a rudimentary adaptation of the salient phases of Spanish architecture as that order has been applied to the uses and ornamentation of the Spanish-Colon\u00ad ial structures. Its outlines were severely simple and its de\u00ad tail was artistically diversified in the individual taste of the buildet\u00b7s. Gradually the Californians drew away from the existing types of the original designs until they had pro\u00ad duced something in itself original and eventually Californian. This product of the artistic and utilitarian purpose of the padres is to be the base of San Diego's exposition architec\u00ad ture under the direction of Bertram G. Goodhue, a leading authority on Spanish-Colonial orders and types. It was a wise decision to house the San Diego exposition in structures that so markedly contrast with those of every other exposi\u00ad tion heretofore exploited. However familiar any observer may be with the various architectural features of other expo\u00ad sitions, he would experience great difficulty in distinguishing one from the other in a series of pictures. They are too monotonously ''classical.'' But the Mission City of San Diego will be recognized at the first glance because it will virtually be an antithesis of the architecture ordinarily adopt\u00ad ed for these purposes. -Even the least learned in these matters would not hesitate in differentiating the aspect of the Al\u00ad hambra from the massive contour of St. Paul's. San Diego does not propose to ''rival'' San Francisco in the effort to promote a World's Fair. It was never the in\u00ad tention of San Diego to duplicate the expositions previously held in Chicago, St. Louis, or even Seattle or Portland. When the enterprise was broached in September, 1910, and when it was finally decided that the completion of the Panama canal in 1915 would be fitting opportunity to commemorate the be\u00ad ginning of civilization in California and along the northern Pacific coast, it was also determined that the undertaking should be in perfect keeping with the unique character of that civilization, and exemplary of the progress of events since the first settlement of this region of the West and South\u00ad west. Consequently the Panama-California International Exposi\u00ad tion will be something different from all other expositions. It will be different in its structure, its scope, its character and its content. As a Mission city its permanent buildings will impress the observer with their novelty and their artistic adaptation to the fundamental purpose of the enterprise. The peculiar and exceptional industries that will be dis\u00ad played, will attract and hold the interest of the observer more readily than the features usually exploited in ''world's fairs'' and ''international expositions.'' The contrast between the strictly industrial and commercial characteristics of universal expositions and the artistic, unique, and educational charac\u00ad ter of the San Diego exposition, will be so marked that there can be no comparison-the one will be complementary of the other; and as both will be Californian the exposition at San Diego and the exposition at San Francisco may be re\u00ad garded as parts of a complete and universal exposition each fulfilling a definite and essential purpose. PLANS OF THE EXPOSITION AN exposition of the scope and intention planned by the Panama-California enterprise is especially adapted to the probabilities underlying the future of San Diego. This exposition is not only commemorative of the completion of the greatest engineering work of modern times; but it is the culmination of years of effort to build a city on the only landlocked harbor of the Pacific coast except San Francisco bay. This exposition is also the real beginning of a new era in the history of the western world. San Diego, where the exposition will be held in 1915, is the first port of call in the United States north of the Panama canal. The distance !rom San Diego to the. canal is three thousand miles and this port will be the most convenient for coaling all steamers crossing the Pacific either way. When the San Diego and Arizona railroad is completed to Yuma, San Diego will be the terminal of the shortest route between the Middle West and the Southern States and Pacific tide\u00ad water. All fast freight and passenger traffic to and from those sections will necessarily pass through San Diego for trans-shipment coastwise and across the Pacific. San Diego \\Vill be the only practicable and feasible shipping point for this traffic, and it has in consequence already earned the name of the ''Gateway to the Southwest.'' A considerable immigration from the Atlantic coast and Europe will pass through San Diego from ''colonist steam\u00ad ers'' chartered for the canal route, and the Panama-Cali\u00ad fornia Exposition will give these settlers ample opportunity to make close investigation of the resources and possibilities of the Southwest and the Pacific coast. These are some of the main reasons why San Diego as\u00ad sessed itself in the sum of $2,000,000 to build an Interna\u00ad tional Exposition in 1915; and to keep it open the entire year.

The Value of the Exposition to San Diego By G. AUBREY DAVIDSON \" Father of the Exposition.\" Vice-President Panama-California Exposition President Southern Trust and Savings Bank ~ EW persons realize the exact value in dollars and %-Qft!@. cents of such an enterprise as the Panama-Cali- ~ fornia Exposition to the city and state in which it is ~ held, unless they have had to do with a project of ~ ~ ~ this character. One is apt to think of an exposition as a grand whirl of excitement lasting a short while in which each person in the city strives his best to make as much of the opportunity as possible. When he thinks of the exposition, it is to picture it as a grandiloquent affair, thus losing sight of its true meaning and relation to the commerce of the world, to the people and the industrial development, not only of his own sec\u00ad tion but of the territory represented. One is apt to forget the detail and actual financial side of an exposition as it affects the city in which it is held. The question has arisen and arises con\u00ad stantly: \"How much benefit will the Panama-California Exposi\u00ad tion be to San Diego and California?\" Most people count as the profit of an exposition only what is expended by the visitor. According to this, San Diego will not begin to reap any benefit until 1915. This is erroneous for already San Diego has reaped a big benefit from the project in increased population and increased building operations necessary to this growth. Then there was the ground-breaking celebration that caused directly an increase in bank clearings for one week of over $198,000. There are more than 11,500,000 people now living in the twelve Pacific Coast and Intermountain States, including Texas and Alaska and not counting British Columbia -all within a radius of 2000 miles of San Diego. By 1915 this figure will have increased to 15,000,000. If only eight per cent. visit S~n Diego during the entire year of 1915, and each one spends but $50 dur\u00ad ing his stay, there will be left in San Diego more cash money than the present entire assessed valuation of the city and county. If only four per cent. come, or if the eight per cent. spend only half as much the amount that will be spent in San Diego in 1915 alone will be $8,000,000 greater than all the money now in the banks and trust companies, plus the assessed valuation of all per\u00ad sonal property, -more money than San Diego now has. But we do not have to wait for 1915 for a great deal of the benefit. The actual construction of the exposition starts this win\u00ad ter. There will be an amount close to $5,000,000 spent in Balboa Park alone between now and 1915, and we shall begin paying out this money right away, perhaps a million dollars within the next eighteen months. For the next four years there will be an annual outlay directly for the exposition of an average of $1,250,000 an\u00ad nually. Add to these expenditures, those of the improvement of the harbor, the extension of the trolley system, the street paving, new buildings already planned for the city itself, the thousaonds of new homes under way and planned, hotels, restaurants, apart\u00ad ment houses, every conceivable kind of building necessary to care for increased population and there is presented a sum total that will add another $20,000,000 to the actual outlay between now and ~e day the exposition opens. This means work for five times as many men in the building trades, five times as much supplies from brick and lumber and kiln products factories, hardware men and other dealers in sup\u00ad plies, and all this money will be paid out to workmen, laborers and tradesmen in San Diego,-the butcher, baker and clothing man, and put money in circulation in !San Diego. St. Louis declares that its exposition was a splendid investment It doubled the commerce and increased the population of St. Louis 19 per cent. in less than five years. Chicago and Omaha had the same experience. Seattle gained more than 100,000 pop\u00ad ulation and Portland sprang into position of the richest city of the northwest following its exposition. Both the Seattle and Port\u00ad land Expositions were relatively small affairs, yet it Is conceded that each one was of great benefit to the city in which it was held. Portland was p:trticularly fortunate in planning in a modest way and paying up, and San Diego is making the same fine record Portland made; she is planning for a small exposition, absolutely unique in appearance and purpose, thus leaving the project Qpen to expansion that may or may not be necessary. With building permits beyond the $4,500,000 mark for the first ten months of 1911, with other improvements under way and pro\u00ad jected, exclusive of Exposition construction, that will cost as much more annually, San Diego during the next four years, if she does no better than she did for the last five years, when a gain of over 123 per cen.t. in population was made, will contain a po)jlula\u00ad tion in 1915 of over 90,000 and will have handled in new money, while growing, more than $161,500,000, if her bank oleafings should remain at the present ratio of gain annually. Bank clear\u00ad ings are increasing at the rate of 28 per cent. annually, and this increase is attributed by many to the impetus given to the exposition. This increase means that between now and 1915, if this rate is maintained, she will handle in cash money the sum of $228,209,943. Bank clearings for 1910 were $66,708,874, or an im:rease of $14,614,353 over the previous year, which is a gain of 28 per cent. The total clearings for the first ten month:! of 1911 are $69,484,339 or an increase of $13,577,202 or 24 per cent. over the same period last year. To gain 28 per cent. the total clearings this year must be $85,387,358, and therefore must show an in\u00ad crease over 1910 of $15,903,019. The clearings for November and December, 1910, amounted to $11,266,838 so that the same period this year must show a total gain of $4,636,181 or approxi\u00ad mately $2,318,090 each month or 41 per cent. U this increase is due to exposition activity, and it undoubtedly is to a certain extent, we may not only feel justified but highly slated over our splendid undertaking. Figuring that the exposition will bring into the city, and is bringing into the city, one-thrd of this in\u00ad crease, we have, expressed in dollars and cents, $76,069,981, certainly a tidy sum for a rainy day. During the exposition year, more than $30,000,000 will be spent by our visitors and, taking all these things into consideration, it can be seen that San Diego is due to handle during the years 1912, 1913, 1914 and 1915, the enormous sum of $100,000,000, from her exposition project alone. Added to this is an equal amount sp&nt by visitors who will tour and tarry in California between the present time and the close of the year 1915. Do expositions pay? Ask any city that has ever held one.\u00ad Scenic America.

The expression of \"trans-canal\", which will soon have preference to that of \"transcontinental\", is causing San Diego to come into her own. This harbor city will be sup\u00ad plied with the commerce from the greatest irrigation systems in the world. l\\Iodern transfer and transportation facilities are being provided which will make San Diego the privi\u00ad ledged port of the coast. as determined \u00b7 by its geographical location. The ability of its shore-line city to attract trade decides the extent of any commercial port. Harbor utilities, capital, freight-producing territories, and transportation facilities are the essential units. San Diego now registers the fact that she is preparing to thus qualify. A threefold increase in population within ten years has bnilded here a city of 55,000. We announce this and challenge any city in the United States to equal the ratio of our building permits which now yearly exceed $100.00 per capita; 1910 represents $4,000,000, and 1911 representing $6,000,000 in these permits, indicates a population of over ] 00,000 when the canal gates are open to business. Just then commercial San Diego has its com\u00ad mencement, entering the competitive fields prepared with modern harbor facilities, and a new direct East,ern railroad. All shipping destined to the Southwest will be attracted to this port. If you believe that the Pacific is going to be the theater of commerce, the canal, the channel for Orient-Atlantic sea\u00ad board trade, or that the ports are to be the transfer depots for coast imports and exports by reason of the Panama ditch, or if you even admit that this government investment will be the equalizer of transcontinental freight, you then ac\u00ad knowledge the claim of this harbor that her name will be found among the principal ports of the world. l.Jocated 100 miles from the arc of the great circle. the short line canal\u00ad Orient route, and as the first port of call, it will he the ter\u00ad minus of the southern low-altitude railroads, and the short\u00ad est transcontinental line. The commerce of the southwest rightfully belongs to the harbor of San Diego. The citrus products of Southern Cali\u00ad fornia exceed 40,000 carloads. Census reports determine the center of this industry at only \u00b10 miles greater distance from this harbor than its nearest seaport landing. One hun\u00ad dred thousand acres is credited with this entire production. The San Diego and Arizona railroad now building, gives us a vantage point by one hundred miles to new fields of com\u00ad merce. One hundred and thirty miles east of this .city is the famous Imperial Valley. Four million dollars have been expended to irrigate 425,000, acres of which over one-half is now extensively cultivated. Across the Mexican border is another 300,000 acres. Bonded products for exports will be transferred at San Diego. Five million dollars for the construction of an irrigation system is being expended on the government project at Yuma. Read what President Roosevelt had to say about these sections in his message to Congress in 1907: \"Seven hundred thousand acres of land as fertile as the Nile valley and is capable of adding to the permanent population of California and Arizona at least 350,000 people and probably 500,000. Much of this land will be worth $500 to $1000 per acre or a total of $350,000,000 to $700,000,000.'' To the east is another immense valley with similar condition, which is to be irrigabed by a government plant costing $9,500,000. The Roosevelt dam, now complete, and considered the largest in the world, will conserve water for this land about Phoenix. Cotton markets of the Orient will be supplied from these sections. Vessels bound for the Orient calling at San Diego can discharge local cargo and replace with this freight. 'fhe yearly rainfall of San Diego County varies from ten to forty inches, according to elevation. Numerous ideal holding basins will conserve this water. Two hundred bil\u00ad lion gallons is a conservative estimate of the capacity. The capacity of the constructed dams is forty-five billion gallons. Initial construction has been commenced on another sys\u00ad tem intended to irrigate forty thousand acres. This added acreage determines us as a great freight center. Immi\u00ad gration has ideal opportunities in irrigated citrus lands and also deciduous lands in our higher elevations where the rainfall is adetlttatc without irrigation. 'l'he San Diego and Arizona railroad is being built at a cost of $10,000,000 to serve these commerce producers. The highest possible standard is being used in its construction. It is the lowest grade and the shortest route of any trans\u00ad Californian road. Four miles of water front terminals, allow access to docks and warehouses. It will be a link of the shortest transcontinental railroad. The canal route, versus the short rail route to the Gulf of l\\Iexico makes San Diego a great competitive point. The higher altitude and arid coun\u00ad try to the north. determines Yuma as the southwestern rail\u00ad road gateway by reason of the series of irrigation systems and lower 'elevation. 'l'he Southern Pacific uses Yuma as its gateway. The Rock Island following the southern border of Arizona is building to a point 200 miles east of this entrance. El Paso is the terminus of another semi-transcontinental line. The Santa Fe railroad now acts as the Southern California distributing line for the American-Hawaiian Steamship Com\u00ad pany whose steamers now unload at this port all their Atlan\u00ad tic seaboard freight destined to the southwest. The confidence in our harbor has been expressed by San Diego people. On ~ovember 14th, 1911, 7200 voted \"Yes\" and 183 ''No\", a ratio of 40 to 1, in voting $1,000,000 in bonds to inaugurate construction wor_k on our new pier sys\u00ad tem. It indicated the realization by our people as to the pos\u00ad sibilities of this harbor. Water front property, 500 to 1200 feet in width, for a distance of nine miles, containing 1350 acres, will be reclaimed and owned by the city. Two other incorporated citirs own the balance, or 22 miles of wate.r front. The cost of this reclamation is $9,000,000. Concrete piers 1,000 feet in length will be constructed from the bulk\u00ad head. They will be connected with a municipal-owned belt railway, occupying a street for warehouses and factories, all of which will be constructed on this reclaimed land. A con\u00ad tinuous bayside avenue will be included in the plan. The opportunity for improvement is ~Cqualed by few harbors. The present harbor channels have never been dredged. Based on low tide figures, they have a depth from 36 to 60 feet, a width of 1500 to 2400 feet for a distance of seven miles. They continue for a distance of five miles with a depth of 15 to 36 feet. Th.e bar now has a low tide depth of 311/z feet, but it is estimated that with an appropriation of $150,000 it can be given the same depth as New York har\u00ad bor, or 40 feet. When the reclamation is completed four miles of channels will have a width of 6000 feet. San Diego will provide the modern harbor facilities, the railroad companies the lines of least resistance to the fields of trade. The proffered commerce will be attractive to ship\u00ad ping. Dispatch is an essential requirement and s-outhwestern imports marked \"via San Diego\" will reach their destina\u00ad tion at the same time the steamer arrives at a neighboring port. PANAMA CALIFORNIA EXPOSITION NEWS 13 Architecture of the Exposition BERTRAM G. GOODHUE Designing and Consulting Architect San Diego's Exposition archi\u00ad tecture is to be built under the direction of Mr. Bertram G. Goodhue, of Washington and New York. ~~q'E~ FTER several months consumed in making ~n\u00b7 ~~'\" _preliminary surveys, and much time and effort ~~lfi expended in. planning accommodations f_or t~e ~ various divisions of the Panama-Cahforma ~\"\u00a7: ~ Exposition in Balboa Park, the buildings and o-rounds committee of the exposition and the city park com\u00ad ~ission have decided upon the actual ground in the park where the expositions will be built, and Director of Works Frank P. Allen Jr. has presented the complete plans for adoption. Con~tru~tion on the Administration Building began Nov. 6th, 1911. . . The site finally selected for the expositiOn embraces ap\u00ad proximately 400 acres of high _and compar_ativ~ly lev~l ground in Balboa Park, and is so situated that 1t Will permit of almost unlimited extension beyond its own confines should the growth of the exposition demand it. It was this very apparent need for space on which to expand, that finall~ de\u00ad cided the members of the buildings and grounds committee and the park commission to abandon the first site chosen and choose a larger one. The first intimation that more space than had at first been considered sufficient would be needed, came when Director\u00ad General D. C. Collier and other members of the legislative committee of the exposition wrote from Washington, after h,aving been there several weeks, that indications for a much larger exposition than had previously been figured on were apparent. As the work in Washington proceeded the feeling became stronger and stronger that there must be ample room for growth, and then came the trip through the southern s1 ates when Director-General Collier and G. Grosvenor Southern Commercial Congress, aroused the enthus\u00ad iasm of the southerners in the exposition to a high pitch, and secured promises of participation that made it certain the original site would not contain the exposition. Meanwhile a representative of the government of Brazil, who had met and talked with Director-General Collier and other representatives of the exposition in New Orleans, came to San Diego. This representative 'vas Eugenio Dahne, and he passed several days in the city, going over the exposition subject with Acting Director-General Joseph W. Sefton, Jr., and members of the Board of Directors. At the end of his visit he announced authoritatively what .t1razil would be willing to do at the Panama-California Ex\u00ad position. The announcement opened the eyes of the expo-sition directors. What Brazil would do, doubtless other countries of Central and South America also would do, and the original site would not contain even that much, let alone what might come from many other sources. It was at this time that the enlarged plan for the exposition, presented by Director of Works Allen was approved as to general features by Director-General Collier, with the understanding that changes shall be made to meet exigencies as they shall arise. This plan shows the main entrance to the exposition grounds at Laurel and Park avenue on the west side of Ca\u00ad brillo Canyon. A causeway and bridge lead to the east side of the canyon, where rise the main buildings of the exposi\u00ad tion, surrounding a rectangular court. From the gate at Laurel street to the eastern end of the bridge will be orna\u00ad mental plazas and esplanades, all within the exposition grounds. The entrance to the central court of honor will be through this group of buildings. Leading south from the court of honor is a street that de\u00ad bouches into a rectangular plar.a. ronnded on the ends-the Plaza de las Republicas America. At the south side of this plaza will be the huge enthnological building, a structure that will be built in the old Spanish-American style with a patio. To the west and down the mesa from this building will be the state and foreign buildings. The main buildings being on the axis, or central line of the bridge, will be grouped around formal courts and will include the California, Art, Agriculture, Horticulture, both Liberal Arts and l\\fachinery, United States Government and mining exhibit buildings. North of this group will be the huge botanical gardens with the finest and most extensive lath house ever built. The lath \u00b7house will be something like 600 feet square and 100 feet high, with a central court for band concerts, foun\u00ad tains and other features. Surrounding it will be the ex\u00ad hibits of the different great seed houses of the world. Here also will be the outdoor exhibits, such as those from the re\u00ad clamation, conservation and forest services of the govern\u00ad ment and the great Indian congress, with the villages and fields of the aborigines, cliff dwellings and pueblos. Across Spanish Canyon will be a dam that will impound a lagoon to be used as an auxiliary water supply for the city fire department, a reservoir of 50,000,000 gallons capacity. Around this lagoon will be grouped ornamental trees, vines and flowers, and it will be connected with the general park syst\u00b7em as a permanent feature. The bridge and causeway form a system of parked esplan\u00ad ade from Laurel street straight into the center of the park, and will be permanent, as will the lagoon on the east side of the mesa in Spanish canyon. All the grading, street and road work will be so arranged that when the temporary buildings are removed, there will be a system of roads an!l streets with ornamental centers, the permanent buildings surrou~ded with groves of trees and flowering bushes. The plans so far approved call for foundation space to the extent of about 165 acres. Added to this must be the space required for the formal gardens, outdoor exhibits, for streets and courts. The whole space required is about 350 acres. The site is on high and comparatively level ground from which a view of the city, harbor and ocean always can b.e hrtd. The mountains form the background, the whole site being almost in the center of the city, instead of removed from the business center by several miles. Architect Goodhue is in love with the new plans and has begun with enthusiasm to perfect the details of his Spanish\u00ad American buildings, the director of works having outlined [Continued on Page 14, Col. 2) 14 PANAMA CALIFORNIA EXPOSITION NEWS ~ H or tic u 1 t u r e~ N expert horticulturist has said that ''an educated cabbage is a cauliflower, and an educated agricul\u00ad turist is a horticulturist.'' Expert cultivation of a small area of land spells the so\u00ad lution of the economic problems confronting the American people of today, the high cost of living and the dependeu_ce of over 60,000,000 of her 95,000,000 people. With these preliminary statements it is now time to say that the Panama-California International Exposition will fulfil its highest purpose by showing the world that horti\u00ad culture and intensive cultivation of lands within a radius of 100 miles of the exposition grounds will provide homes, a living and independence to 2,000,000 people. Horticulture is to be the main outdoor feature of the ex\u00ad position. The climate permits of unlimited experiments and a diversity of exhibits never before possible at an interna\u00ad tional exposition. Hundreds of thousands of trees, vines and flowering plants are now being propagated for this exhibi\u00ad tion. At no time in the history of expositions has there been laid out such an ambitious program along horticultural lines. From the moment the visitor enters the grounds of the Ex\u00ad position until he leaves he will pass through and be sur\u00ad rounded by examples of horticultural possibilities such as he never saw before. One huge section of the grounds will be devoted to gar\u00ad dens and a great nursery, a lath house, and a system of floral gardens the like of which has never been seen in America. In another portion of the grounds will be the section devoted to the Little Landers and their model farms. The buildings of the exposition proper, the concessions, the different state and govern~eilt buildings, the streets, prados, plazas, and grounds of the exposition are to be filled, lined and embellished with a wealth of flowering plants, graceful trees and climbing vines gathered from the four corners of the globe. In other places will be the whole known collection of edible plants, those whose roots or leaves are valuable to man for food. It is not the purpose of the exposition to simply show these plants; the deeper and more earnest purpose is to show the most modern and efficient methods of preparation and cultivation of the soil that produces them-to show the most improved methods of coaxing from Mother Earth the bounty and plenty she gladly gives to those who ask from her. In other words, it is methods; not simply results, that are to be shown here. One of the main ideas in this program is to demonstrate the well known truth that transplantation and cultivation of the wild plants of California cannot but be of great ben\u00ad efit to the people who live in California. 'l'his applies not only to the wild flowers, but to the wild grasses, the trees and the bushes that cover the mountains, plains and val\u00ad leys of California from Siskiyou to San Diego, a diversity withal not found in another political division of the same area in the world. The lesson to be taught and the benefits to be shown are simply this: that it is easier to make a living in Southern California from one, two or five acres of land, than it is by vrorking for wag.es in any city of the east or middle west, where the rigors of winter follow the withering heat of summer year after year, in paralyzing, disenergizing, suc\u00ad cession. This lesson will be taught easily and pleasantly. The visitor to the exposition will pass down a central prado lined with tr,ees and bushes he never saw before. Each and all of these trees will be of varietie~ valuable for the wood, for their medicinal leaves, or their fruit. H:ls first digres\u00ad sion from the main street will be to \u00b7enter a formal garden planted around a shallow pool, a dream place filled with every variety of water plant, shaded by pleasant trees and surrounded by beautiful vines. Before him will rise in majestic and entrancing beauty such a lath house as has never been seen in the world, a palace of beauty that will make the memory of the glory of Solomon's temple fade into insignificance; a palace of bloom and fragrance possi\u00ad ble only in a climate like that of San Diego where the ex\u00ad position is to be open the year round. Surrounding: this bower of beauty will be formal gardens planted in trees and grass, a resting place and a play ground, flanked by fruit trees, berries and all the utilitarian flora known to modern horticulturalists. This section of the ex\u00ad position will fill a large space, and with the Little Landers and small farms will present a lesson that cannot fail of its purpose. With plenty of good soil, abundance of water and all the sum of experience of the most expert horticulturalists in the world, it is a foregone conclusion that this section of the Panama-California International Exposition will be worth crossing the continent to see. Once seen it cannot fail to attract to the soil of Southern California every land hungry man and woman of the blizzard haunted east who visits the exposition. Architecture of the Exposition [Continued from Page 13] the needs as finally determined by the buildings and grounds committee. The acreage of the exposition inside the enclosure will be 400 acres. The foundations of the main buildings will cover 100 acres. Those of the state, foreign and county buildings nearly 100 more; gardens, parks and streets a third 100 acres. \"El Rodeo\", will have 8000 feet of frontage, and 8000 feet of frontage is available for the open air conces\u00ad sions. The Administration building will be finished by March 30, 1912.

JONES 0 N May 10, 1908, several merchants happened to meet on a down town street corner and after the usual greetings, began discussing the pros and cons of a proposition to organize an association among the retailers of the city for the purpose of bringing them into a more friendly rela\u00ad tion as competitors, and to also protect themselves against the many abuses which the dead beat, the fake advertising and charity workers, etc., were heaping upon them. It was unanimously agreed that to accomplish anything along this line, a strong organization must be formed and as a starter, a call was issued for a meeting of all who were interested in the subject. About one hundred business men attended, listened to the stirring talks on the subject, and then signed their names to the membership roll. W. L. Frevert was elected president and J. N. Newkirk secretary. Offices were en\u00ad gaged in the Fox-Heller Block and business opened. A set of rules on advertising was adopted, charity solicitation was regulated, and a credit reporting and collecting system inaugurated. At the end of the first year it was found that fully $15,- 000 had been saved the members by turning down numerous applications for advertising permits which did not have the true ring to them. Much good had also been accomplished in other directions, but the credit reporting feature had not become especially valuable for lack of proper organization. Upon request of the directors, W. 0. Talbot, who for eleven years had managed Dunn's Mercantile Agency here, investigated the credit reporting work which had been done and found it wholly inadequate to the needs of the mem\u00ad bers. Upon his recommendation the Association was reg\u00ad ularly incorporated under the state laws, and under his di\u00ad rection an up-to-date and efficient credit reporting system was established. H. C. Provin of Grand Rapids, Michigan, was employed to take personal charge of that feature of the Association work from June 1, 1909, and in the following August Mr. Talbot was elected secretary and he assumed active management of all departments. The membership at that time was less than one hundred , but an active campaign for new members was inaugurated and persistently follow\u00ad ed up, until now there is a total enrollment of over three hundred and six1 ,v. and every department of the A.ssocia:ion is in a flourishing condition. The original advertising rules, with several amendments, are still in force, and while it is difficult to convince all of the members that certain forms of advertising are unpro\u00ad ductive of trade getting, and therefore should be avoided, the merchants as a rule are loyal to their organization and patronize no advertising schemes unless authorized by the Association. Much legislation, city and state, has been secured directly or indirectly through the efforts of the Association, and while civic or boosting questions have been left largely to other organizations, its moral support is given all worthy causes. 'l'he credit reporting department comprises an extensive card system containing information on thousands of indi\u00ad viduals, firms and corporations, and over one thousand in\u00ad quiries from members are answered each month. An effec\u00ad tive collection department is also maintained, through which considerable money is collected for the members on bad accounts. It is safe to say that no organization of the kind in this country has a more reliable or satisfactory system than does this one, and as time goes on its general useful\u00ad ness in the community will become more apparent. There are many bigger associations in the country, notably Chicago, with its 4,500 members, but the local organization is larger in proportion to the population , and the dues, $2.00 per month, are the smallest on record, commensurate with the benefits accruing. The Association has several outings each year at which there is no attempt at making a profit, and one excursion was recently run to the Western Salt Works and Sweetwater Dam, which over one hundred members and their friends attended, all the expenses being met out of the Association treasury. It is the ambition of the directors to give the maximum of benefits at the minimum of cost to all members, for which reason the receipts are barely sufficient to meet the ex\u00ad penses, which latter at present aggregate about $10,000 per annum. The active management of all departments is left almost entirely to the secretary, who selects his own assistants of which there are nine at present. A suite of five offices is maintained on the seventh floor of the Timken Building, a modern concrete structure, and the Association is well equipped to handle its growing busi\u00ad ness. A large assembly room is used every Tuesday morn\u00ad ing by the Board of Directors and sub-organizations among the membership, committees, etc., also make good use of the room at other times. An invitation is extended to all mercantile and commercial concerns to take membership, and the professional classes are also welcome to become patrons of the credit reporting and collection departments. Among the present membership will be found retailers of all lines, some wholesalers and manufacturers, telephone and telegraph companies , railroads, banks, automobile deal\u00ad ers, insurance concerns, daily newspapers, printers, etc. No business unless coming under the classification of mercan\u00ad tile, commercial or financial is eligible to membership, but all others desiring to become affiliated with the Association can do so by becoming a patron or subscriber, the dues for which being $1.00 per month on a one year contract. 16 PANAMA CALIFORNIA EXPO~ITION NEWS San Diego's Climate OT the least exceptional of the many exceptional features of the Panama-California Exposition is one that has been provided by nature itself. It is announced that the exposition will be opened January 1, 1915, and that it will close at mid\u00ad a:==== night of December 31. There will be no \"post\u00ad ponement on account of the weather\" at any time during the period of the exposition. 'l'his promise on the part of the management of the exposition is based on the climato\u00ad logical records of San Diego during a series of seasons for more than thirty years. These records show that the aver\u00ad age rainfall of San Diego does not exceed ten inches and that it is evenly distributed over about four months. On no day of the year would it be necessary to defer a visit to the exposition grounds in fear that the visitor would ''be caught in the rain.\" The range of temperature seldom varies from a maximum of eighty-two to a minimum of thirty-nine; and it is the boast of the loyal San Diegan that his is the ''shortest thermometer in the world.'' It is upon this climatic condition that the exposition man\u00ad agement has arranged for all-the-year fair in the open, un\u00ad der the bluest of blue ski\u00b7es, upon a site that commands a prospect of sea, mountain and valley unsurpassed by any other on the Californian coast and unequalled anywhere on earth. 1'he mingling of the ocean breezes and the warm winds of the Mexican desert, the average force of which is six miles an hour, has contributed measurably to the salu\u00ad brity of a climate that can be compar\u00b7ed only with the best seasons of any specially favored spot on earth. It is upon this natural asset of superior climate that the San Diegans count for one dominant factor in the ultimate success of their exposition. They believe that on this natur\u00ad al advantage alone those who visit the exposition will be content to remain in ''the land where it is always after\u00ad noon.'' Balboa Park, the site of the Panama-California Exposi\u00ad tion, is a reservation from the original pueblo of San Diego under the first Spanish grant in California. It comprises 1400 acres of high land intersected by deep canyons slop\u00ad ing gently from broad mesas. From the higher elevations and the\u00b7 jutting promontories of this magnificent park one of the most beautifully diver\u00ad sified prospects in the world spreads away in every direc\u00ad tion. To the eastward rises the purple Cuyamaca range dominated by Cuyamaca and San l\\Iiguel peaks; on the south the mountains of l\\Iexico form a ragged sky line van\u00ad ishing in the desert mists of Lower California; almost at the feet of the observer , like a herd of mastodons bathing in the sea, are the islands of Coronado; in the foreground to the westward is the long, level headland of Point Lorna divid\u00ad ing the channel of San Diego bay from the waters of the Pacific like the prow of a mighty battleship; close within the near vision of the spectator is the bay itself, the clustered villas of Coronado embowered in palms and sub-tropical foliage; and sweeping up to the verge of the park is the city of San Diego stretching north and south along the land\u00ad locked harbor. The park is being planted with trees and foliage best suited to the soil and climate; the canyons will be terraced; roads and paths will be built; and in this setting will be erected the group of buildings to be called the Mission City in which will be housed the display of the Panama-California Expus1tion and afterwards devoted to permanent use by the city. THE LITTLE LANDERS' COLONY ~Q NE of the principal features of the Panama-Califor\u00ad ~ nia International Exposition will be the model farms of the \"Little Landers,\" a colony of people who are in the forefront of the national \"landless man to the manless land\" movement. It has been demonstrated conclusively by the Little Landers, and by others, that the small farm is the solution of the economic difficulties in which millions of city-penned men find themselves in the United States. J:i~or several years this movement has b<7en growing. In nearly every section of Southern California can be found farms of from one acre to ten acres upon which the holder is living well, raising a family, enjoying good healtll and happiness, and filling his place as -a useful and beneficial member of society. The idea of displaying a model farm at the expositiou was original with the Little Landers. First plans includPd three one-acre farms in the Exposition grounds, each ont devoted to a different kind of agriculture, all three to be shown with results during the exposition. This was modi\u00ad fied to the extent that it was proposed to put in five farms, of one, two, three, four and five acres, and to show the comparative results on each. Discussion of this plan led to the adoption of the plan to have two one-acre farms, so arranged that they shall be easy of access, with walks and roads through them. each containing the home and necessary buildings in exact re\u00ad production 0f a similar place designed for a homn in the Little Landers colonY. The idea has bee~ taken up at this time because three years that intervene before the opening day, January 1, 1915, are none too long in which to bring the model farms mto complete. intensive cultivation. Each is to be planted during the winter oi 1911-12. The ground is to be plowed at once. Preparation of the soil is to follow. Construction of the buildings will be this winter. Each model farm will have a residence, barn and other necessary buildings, small, but adequate. Each farm is to be planted to diversified crops. Instead of having one of the three planted in berries, one in fruit and one in vegetables, an attempt will be made to plant all three varieties on each farm just as a settler would plant a similar area upon which he expected to live and raise his family. This plan involves careful selection of soil and location. The park, containing 1400 acres, has every variety of soil, but selection must be at some point in the park inside the exposition grounds, or as close thereto that the farm can be surrounded by the Pnclosure of the exposition. During the three years of preparation, data will be kept on each farm. A complete record will be available when the exposition opens to show just what was raised the first year, with the cost and the income, the second and third years. and a genrral average of the whole. The I .. ittle Landers daim that a farmer may pay every cost, that of the land. the buildings and all his living expenses from the products of one acre in-,itle of three years. and that in many cases the settlers on these little farms have macie the land self\u00ad supporting from the very start. The central idea in this exhibition is to show the thou\u00ad sands of visitors at the exposition that here in San Diego county it is possible for a man of industry to live comfort\u00ad [ Continued on Page 17] PANAMA CAL IF 0 R N I A EX P 0 SIT I 0 N N E \\V S 17 MATERIAL ORDERED FOR FAIR BUILDING Director of Works Frank P. Allen Proposes to Keep Things '--------. Moving Rapidly .--------' Director of Works Frank P. Allen of the Panama\u00ad California Exposition, has placed orders for mater\u00ad ial with which to begin construction of the admin\u00ad istration building. Carpenters will begin work at once. The administration building is to be occupied by the offices of the president and other departments of the exposition organization. 'I'he structure will be two stories with basement, and was de\u00ad signed by Bertram G. Goodhue as a part of the architectural composition at the east end of the bridge across Cabrillo canyon. 'l'he board of di\u00ad rectors and park commissioners adopted the plans at the November meeting. The total cost of this building will be about *:30.000 and it will be ready for occupancy about the first of March next. Graders are at work on the west park boulevard at Laurel street and at the west approach to the bridge, where a large amount of fillings is to be done. This bridge will be 750 feet in length, 125 feet in height in the center and will con\u00ad nect the Laurel street entrance with the buildings in the center of the park. 'l'he aclministration building will stand at the east end on the left and will be the first building Plans of the Exposition [Continued from Page 7] The enterprise, therefore, may not be regarded as provincial but rather as one necessary to the exploitation of a region imperial in area, and opulent in developing and undeveloped resources. The plan of the Panama-California Exposition is not along the lines usually followed by other enterprises of this char\u00ad acter. Neither was it ever intended that this exposition in its details should be confined strictly to the commercial and industrial ''exhibits.'' The scope of the San Diego project was limited to the resources and products of the Southwest and the countries contiguous or tributory to that region. Moreover, it was decided that as the commemoration of the completion of the Panama canal would induce at least one \"world's fair\" and possibly a number of lesser enterprises of a local chara~ter, it would be more to the purpose of San Diego's intention to furnish an exposition in which novelty, rarity, entertainment and educational or artistic features would predominate. The vast and important interes1s now engaged in the re\u00ad claiming of the arid Southwest; the possibilities of a new world opening to the energy and enterprise of mankind, were deemed a basis broad enough on which to build an industrial and commercial exposition that would attract the attention of every nation. With this substantial and neces\u00ad sary adjunct it was decided to group the existing conditions of the region of which San Diego hopes to be the outport when the new track of commerce is laid from the canal to the Orient. 'l'his would include a gathering and classifica\u00ad tion of the oboriginal tribes of sub-tropical America with their industries, handicrafts and customs. It would also in\u00ad clude everything archaelogical pertaining to the past history ADMINISTRATION BUILDING CALIFORNIA BUILDING reached.

And it would bring into sharp relief every advantage of soil and climate to the end that the world may know better than by any other method what the conditions of this section are and the illimitable possibilities of the future. This, in brief, is the salient idea of the Panama-California Exposition, to be held in San Diego throughout the entire year of 1915. The Little Landers' Colony [Continued from Page 16] ably off the proceeds of one acre of ground. The county has hundreds of thousands of acres of land suitable for such subdivision and the effort will be to bring thousands of settlers to San Diego county to take up these lands and achieve independence. It is a noble conception, the fruition of which will bring about the settlement of thousands of happy men, women and children in a territory now unproductive, or at best productive of a very small percentage of those things that go toward the sum total of human happiness, an effort that represents the highest purpose of the Panama-California International Exposition.

MONSIGNOR SEBASTIAN KNEIPP The Story of a Mountain Spring Many years before the rule of the white man and when only the foot-worn Indian trails served as highways, the pioneer hunter and guide, Colonel Amos Buckman, with a small but staunch part)\u00b7 of gold hunters left Old Town, California, and llirected their course toward the distant mountains. After a journey of hardships and trials they carne across an Indian encampment with its tepees pitched by the side of a wonderful bubbling mountain spring. Long ere the sun had sunk over the mountain crests it became known to this little band of men that this water was re\u00ad garded by these tribes of red men as being the water of the air. meaning, the magic ,springs. Impressed with these strange but historic facts, Amos Buckman started an investi\u00ad gation of his own and was not long in discovering that which the Indians believed the \u00b7work of spirits was nought else but the handiwork of God. He discovered that the waters of this \u00b7magic spring possessed marked and wonder\u00ad ful medicinal qualities. Hurrying back over that mountain trail, this man sought aid in developing what today are the most remarkable natural lithia springs in America. It is an established fact that the ordinary lithia water sold now is lithiated after it comes from the ground, and what lithiated water can do the natural lithia water will do much better, and so it was not long before Buckman Springs Natural Lithia Water. taken from nature's \u00b7own under\u00ad ground laboratory superseded much of the lithiated water used, and came into practical universal favor. Buckman Lithia Springs are situated nine miles from Campo, a mountain town, sixty-five miles from San Diego, in one of the most beautiful parts of sunny California. 'l'hey are reached by a trip through the unsurpassed scenery of Southern California, its orange and olive groves. foot hills and mountains, and they are the only springs whose water is entitled to be labeled \"Lithia\". Analysis shows that Buckman Springs water is charged with lithia, as. well as with gases ana medicinal elements, greater in number and efficiency than those of any other mineral water thus far discovered. This statement. which is of prime significance, can be verified in a thousand ways. The fact that Buckman Springs Lithia \\Vater does not con\u00ad tain one atom of artificiallv made substance. would alone make it the purest mineral ~ater. This water is recognized throughout the United States as, a water noted fo1\u00b7 being c)larged with nature-made carbonic acid gas. As this gas comes from the ground it carries with it the mineral prop\u00ad erties as they are manufactured in the laboratory of nature. Extended experience with this water proves that it is some\u00ad thing more than a delightful beverage; that it has in a marked degree the corrective medicinal qualities which ap\u00ad pealed to its earliest users. the Indians. This water was drunk for centuries with impunity hy these noble redmen M. A. LESEM, Proprietor of the forest, and its general acceptance by the white peo\u00ad ple is now recognized as furth>er evidence of its beneficial qualities.-Adv. BURLINGAME . Burlingame, in common with the other territory lying to the east and north of the heretofore unimproved area of Balboa park, has until recently been neglected by investors and home builders. Nobody ever went t'here; nobody built. Values remainerllow. It was this fact that largely accounted for the snccess of the \\Vest End where tracts were bought at rock-bottom value before the first wave of the overflow pop\u00ad dation reached the vicinitY. In most instances this land was marked at prices less than those asked for property a mile anrl more beyond the city limits. 'l'he buyers, therefore, got the benefit of the bargain and many of them sold their lots again at a profit almost immediately, repeating the pro\u00ad cess several times. The selection of Balboa park for the site of the Panama\u00ad California International Exposition then threw Burlingame in the line of San Diego's fastest growth, and will make it an exclusive high-class residence section. It is the only re\u00ad maining close-in subdivision between the park and the east\u00ad ern city limits and is in the very heart of the fashionable residence district that is growing up along the eastern border of the park, corresponding to Bankers' Row on the other side. Consequently. s\u00b7o long as San Diego has its Balboa Park, just so long will Burlingame increase in value as fast as the population increases. From the level acres of Burlingame the eye sweeps over a wonderful panorama. In the foreground lies the park, its mesas and canyons soon to be covered with the exposition buildings. Beyond, the silver sheen of the ba,v meets the white strip of sand that separates it from the blue Pacific. Far out at sea the Coronado Islands rise out of the blue depths. Point Loma is sharply outlined against t'he back\u00ad ground of the heaving sea. To the south, far along the reaches of the bay, lies the city. Into the blue distances of Mexico sweeps the eye, over valleys, canyons and mesas. 'l'o the east, the frowning Cuyamacas. their peaks covered with snow in the winter, supply a fitting frame for the picture. Burlingame is How a camp of graders and artisans, busily engaged in the work of conforming the streets to the undulations of the ground without making excessive cuts or fills, laying of sidewalks and curbing and planting the laege parkings with the rare cocos plumas palm. Building restrictions as to price and placing of structures, fencing, elevation of buildings, style of architecture (a rare clause), and also a stipulation that will prevent the erection of any apartment hmmes or business houses of any kind, gives assurance that Burlingame will forever remain an ex\u00ad clusive residence section.-Adv.

It will be regularly supplied by the publicity department of t'he Panama-California Exposition with news relating to the progress of the exposition work. It will also contain articles from the same department intended to promote the interests of San Diego city and harbor, and the trade empire behind it. The Chamber of Commerce will also contribute regu\u00ad larly to this magazine. It is a fact that notwithstanding the publicity that is being given this exposition and San Diego, it has been dif\u00ad ficult for persons living at a distance to keep informed on the matters t'his magazine is intended to cover. This diffi\u00ad culty will, we trust, be largely removed by the publication of the Exposition News, the need of which has long been apparent. -Editor.
