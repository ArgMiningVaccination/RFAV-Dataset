Dr. Baker is also a Founding Member of the Stanford Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine and the Standard March of Dimes Prematurity Institute. A native Minnesotan, she completed her PhD at Columbia University and a Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of California Berkeley, after which she joined Stanford's Department of Genetics as an Assistant Professor. As a researcher, she has studied the evolution of the placenta and the impact of the diverse evolutionary trajectories on maternal and fetal health, particularly in human disease. Using a variety of model systems, her laboratory studies these genetic and developmental aspects of placental biology to better understand how this organ forms, evolves and possibly contributes to disease. Her work has been continuously supported by federal and private funding sources, with a long track record of publications and invited lectures. Dr. Baker has been honored with numerous awards for her work as a researcher and educator, and is currently the Catherine R. Kennedy and Daniel L. Grossman Fellow in Human Biology. This fellowship recognizes an investment of time and energy to the advancement of the core curriculum, something she has done as she works to identify novel tools to teach biology to a broad audience of learners.KEYNOTE LECTURERJulie Baker, PhD \"The Strange Biology of the Placenta and its Critical Importance to Human Health\" Karen Schindler, PhD\"Understanding the Underlying Genetics Causing Maternal Aneuploidy\" Dr. Karen Schindler is an Associate Professor in the Department of Genetics at Rutgers University, New Jersey.

These actions i nclude the regulation of the trophoblas t cell lineage and hemochorial pl acentation. Trophoblast stem (TS) c ells ex to i ts func tional properties. Specialized trophoblas t cells can produce hormones, facilitate bi -directional nutrient/waste transfer, evade maternal i mmune system attack, and invade and transform the uterus. Invasiv e trophoblast cells restructur e uterine spiral arteries to facili tate blood delivery to the placenta. Disruptions i n uterine spiral arter y remodeling are connected to pregnancy r elated diseases s uch as early pregnancy l oss, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and pre-t erm bi rth. We hypothesize that TS c ells and the invasive trophoblast cell l ineage are targets for th e actions of transcription fac tor A P-2 gamma (TFAP2C) . To test this hypothesis , we used first trimester human placental s pecimens, human TS c ells, and genome models. Using in situ hybridiz ation , TFAP2C was localized to the extravillous tr ophoblast (EVT) c ell column. TFAP2C expression w as most prominent in the proximal region of the E VT cell colum n where stem/progenitor c ells ar e located. TFAP2C w as also expressed in human TS c ells. Loss -of- function experiments, using lentiviral delivered short hairpin RNAs specific to TFAP2C, were also performed in human TS cells. Disruption of TFAP2C interfered with maintenance of the stem state and led to an arrest in cell proliferation and profound changes in gene expression profiles. We further sought to investigate the biology the TFAP2C in the rat. The rat possesses deep placentation characterized by extensive intrauterine trophoblast cell invasion similar to human placentation. Single cell RNA sequencing of the rat uterine-placental interface demonstrated prominent and specific expression of TFAP2C in invasive trophoblast cells. These results were confirmed by in situ hybridization. Genome editing was utilized to generate a global disruption of the Tfap2c gene in the rat. A 308 bp out-of-frame deletion was generated targeting the DNA binding domain of TFAP2C. Homozygous Tfap2c mutants died between gestation days (gd) 8.5 and 9.5, a timeframe earlier than the onset of the major wave of intrauterine trophoblast cell invasion. We also examined Tfap2c heterozygous ( Tfap2c +/-) placentation sites at gd 15.5 and 18.5 and observed disruptions in intrauterine trophoblast cell invasion and retention of natural killer cells within the uterine -placental interface. The results indicate dose-dependent actions of TFAP2C within the rat placentation site. In summary, we established in vitro and in vivo model systems for investigating the TFAP2C in trophoblast cell lineage and placental development and implicate the TFAP2C in the regulation of the trophoblast stem cell state and the invasive trophoblast/EVT cell l ineage in both human and rat placentation . [Supported by Lalor Foundation postdoctoral to AM and EMD, NIH HD099638, and the Sosland to Cannabinoids on Signaling Missouri -Kansas City School of Medicine, 2University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh PA, 3Kansas University Medical Center, Kansas City, KS. Background and Objectives: Preterm birth i ncreases the risk for Respiratory Distress Syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage and necrotizing enterocolitis, conditions associated with significant rates of infant mortality. Treatment with synthetic glucocorticoids (sGC) promotes organ maturation increasing survival . Studi es in human and animal models demonstrate that antenatal sGC exposure alters cell proliferation, neuron quantity and morphology and leads to long-t erm neurobehavioral alterations . 5.4% of pregnant women admit to us ing Cannabis during pregnancy and this number is increasing, particularly in light of perceptions that it is less dangerous than alcohol or other recreational drugs during pregnancy. Cannabis activates the endogenous cannabinoid system (ECBR) promotes cell proliferation and neurodevelopment and cognitive function akin to antenatal sGC exposure. This observation poses the question whether antenatal cannabis exposure will impact the efficacy of GC therapy used in mothers at risk of pre-term birth. We hyp othesize that prenatal ECBR pathway activation will alter sGC signaling to impact neural development and long-term neurobehavioral outcome. Methods and Analyses: Antenatal sGC expos ure m ouse cerebral cortical primary neural stem cells were exposed to cannabinoids or vehicle overnight and then sGC or vehicle for 4 hours. W hole genome expression studies were performed using Affymetrix Clario m S and D microchips . In vitro proliferation/ differentiation studies were performed for 5 days. Cells were immunostained for markers of neurons, neuroglia, and progenitor cells, quantified and statistically subset of sGC -inducible genes and vice versa. Concomitant application of cannabinoid and glucocortic oid also led to unique gene expression profiles compared to the control or either treatment alone. A number of genes integral for stem cell function or implicated in the development of several psychiatric conditions were altered. In addition, in- vitro differentiation studies indicate that cannabinoid administration led to changes in the proportion of neurons, oligodendrocytes and glial cells generated. In differentiated cerebral cortical neurons, n euron complexity was decreased by simultaneous ECBR and sGC activation. Conclusions: These studies indicate that crosstalk between cannabinoid and glucocorticoid signaling pathways in the developing brain impacts the beneficial and detrimental consequences of neonatal sGC exposure and may impact long-term neurobehavioral effects of sGC or cannabis exposure. Studying the intracellular pathways and biological processes that are altered may lead to the development of therapeutic interventions for children whose mothers use cannabis and are at risk of pre-term birth. 2 17Dual Energy X-r ay Quinnlyn Walcott, Hanna Crow, DO, Leland Graves, MD, Courtney Marsh, MD ABSTRACT Background In the transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) population, it is unclear whether long-term effects of gender affirming hormone therapies and gonadal surgeries have profound effects on bone health. The gold standard for determining bone health is by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA); (1) however, the use of sex- based reference indices has been shown to be confusing when performing the test for individuals who identify as TGNC.(2) In 2019, the International Society of Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) took the first official \"positions\" regarding how to perform a DXA scan for TGNC patients.(3) Unfortunately, despite the ISCD position, confusion still exists on how to interpret DXA scans in gender diverse patients. As it has been over 2 years since the ISCD position was published, we aim to assess sex and gender identification in gender diverse population undergoing DXA from a broad sampling of health systems in the United States. Methods In this cross-sectional study, a unique survey using REDCap software was created by utilizing and reformatting the 2019 ISCD DXA TGNC position statement into multiple choice questions.( 3-5) Respondent demographics, state of employment, DXA experience, knowledge of the TGNC community, and how the respondent performs/ interprets DXA scans for TGNC patients were collected. The questionnaire was distributed directly to radiology, endocrinology, and OB/GYN departments across the United States via institutional email where emails were obtaine d from hospital department websites. Additionally, researchers relied on email recipients forwarding the survey to potential respondents as a means of survey distribution. Results Survey respondents represented 14 different states, most being from an academic/ university health system. The majority of respondents indicated that they utilize the patient's chart to determine sex and gender information about the patient for DXA rather than asking the patients how they identify at the time of the test. Furthermore, comparing the survey responses to the 2019 ISCD official positions for DXA in transgender individuals, 75% of T-scores and 96% and 86% of Z-scores deemed \"incorrect\" in non- binary individuals. Conclusions The majority of survey respondents do not or would not apply the correct reference index when performing DXA scans in the TGNC population as set forth by the ISCD. Currently, the ISCD position statement on performing DXA in the TGNC population is the only society who provides guidance on bone health in this population. When clinicians stray from these guidelines, patients may receive incorrect DXA results as well as mis sed diagnoses of low bone mass. Future prospective studies need to be conducted to evaluate utilization and the long-term effects of the position's guidance. 3 18F-actin is required for the fidelity of bipolar spindle formation in mouse oocytes Edgar J. Soto-Moreno and A hmed Z. Balboula University of Missouri - Division of Animal Sciences A critical step in oocyte meiosis is the formation of a bipolar spindle that provides the machinery for accurate chromosome segregation. in somatic mitotic cells, centrioles are organelles that maintain centrosome integrity and play critical roles in regulating bipolar spindle formation. In contrast to mitotic cells, mouse oocytes lack centrioles and, therefore, bipolar spindle assembly depends on self-organization of numerous microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) into two poles. Accordingly, following NEBD, MTOCs undergo two critical steps to assemble 1) MTOC sorting (i.e., MTOC movement and distribution towards the poles). Thus, at metaphase (Met) I, the oocyte already has two spindle poles with clustered and sorted MTOC foci. The molecular mechanism regulating this self-organization of MTOCs in oocytes remains largely unknown. The traditional view was that, in mammalian oocytes, microtubules (MTs) and their associated proteins are the only cytoskeletal components responsible for regulating spindle bipolarity. However, recent data revealed that F-actin inhibition prevents bipolar spindle assembly in human oocytes. How F-actin regulates spindle bipolarity in mammalian oocytes remains unknown. We found that perturbing global or cytoplasmic, but not cortical, F-actin resulted in MTOC clustering and sorting defects, and decreased percentages of bipolar spindle at Met I. Interestingly, in mammalian oocytes, F-actin localizes to the MT spindle and forms a structure called the actin-spindle. The biological significance of such localization for bipolar spindle assembly are still unknown. We used two different approaches to address this question. First, siRNA -mediated depletion of unconventional myosins (MyoX, which link F -actin to MTs by having both MT and F- actin binding domains) or expressing a dominant negative MyoX mutant (mutation at the MT binding domain) abolished F-actin localization to the spindle, phenocopied MTOC clustering and sorting defects in F-actin -perturbed oocytes and increased the incidence of aneuploidy at Met II. Such phenotypes were rescued by forcing F-actin localization to the spindle in Myo-depleted oocytes using UtrCH-MAP4. Second, we optimized a novel photoswitchable optojasp approach that can manipulate actin dynami cs at a m precision to perturb F-actin selectively at the spindle, following its exposure to 405 nm laser pulses. Perturbing spindle-localized F-actin optojasp resulted in clustering and sorting defects compared to laser-exposed untreated or optojasp-treated controls. Importantly, exposing one spindle pole to laser pulses (to perturb F-actin selectively at one spindle pole) in optojasp-treated Met I oocytes (with already clustered and sorted MTOCs) resulted in MTOC clustering and sorting defects compared to those at the non-laser exposed spindle pole. Taken together, these findings reveal an unexpected function of F -actin in bipolar spindle assembly in mammalian meiosis, a process that is notoriously prone to mistakes. 4 19Single nuclei t ranscriptomics of t he bovine placenta at m id gestation predicts transcription factors involved with trophoblast fate Kimberly M.

Soares1,3,4 1Institute for Reproductive and Developmental Sciences and Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS; 2Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Mercy Research Insitute, Children's Mercy Kansas City, Kansas City MO; 3Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, K S; 4Center for Perinatal Research, Children's Mercy Research Institute, Children's Mercy Kansas City, Kansas City, MO Placental development involves coordinated expansion and differentiation of trophoblast cell lineages possessing specialized functions. Complex pathways of trophoblast cell proliferation, migration and differentiation must occur for the placenta to function properly. Among the differentiated trophoblast cell lineages, are invasive trophoblast cells, which exit the placenta and invade into the uterus where they restructure the uterine parenchyma and facilitate remodeling of uterine spiral arteries. Invasive trophoblast cells help anchor the placenta, modulate immune cell populations, and assist in the delivery of blood to the placenta and fetus. Failure of trophoblast cell-guided uterine vasculature remodeling is associated with pathological conditions such as preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth, and early pregnancy loss. Knowledge of molecular mechanisms that regulate the function and development of the invasive trophoblast cell lineage is poorly understood but a key to understanding the etiology of pregnancy -associated diseases. A suitable animal model can facilitate the discovery of regulatory pathways controlling development of the uterine-placental interface. The rat exhibits deep intrauterine trophoblast cell invasion, a feature shared with human placentation. The rat is also amenable to gene manipulation using genome editing techniques . Global knock out in the rat is an effective tool for investigating a subset of candidate genes implicated in the regulation of deep hemochorial placentation. However, disruption of other genes leads to a prenatal lethal phenotype, which limits their utility for investigating placentation. In this study we generat ed a conditional allele to circumvent this issue. We have identified and verified Prl7b1 as a gene specifically expressed in the invasive trophoblast cell lineage using single-cell RNA -sequencing and in situ hybridization on gestation day s (gd) 15.5 and 19.5 uterine-placental interface tissues . We generated a knock - in rat model using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing that expresses improved Cre recombinase (iCre ) in invasive trophoblast cells under the control of Prl7b1 regulatory sequences . A construct containing iCre sequence flanked by homology arm s (500 bp) along with a targeted gRNA were microinjected into gd 0.5 zygotes. Founders were screened for the iCre sequence. We then validated the Prl7b1-iCre driver rat strain using the Tg(CAGloxP -STOP -loxP-ZsGreen) reporter strain (Rat Resource Research Center, University of Missouri, Columbia) . Experiments confirmed the precise expression of Prl7b1-iCre in invasive trophoblast cells within the uterine-placental interface. Our novel rat model represents a valuable new tool for the scientific community to discern roles for candidate genes contributing to the regulation of invasive trophoblast cells and their contributions to trophoblast-guided uterine spiral artery remodeling. This model will also aid in the establishment of experimental paradigm s to explore the etiology of high-risk pregnancies.

Long Zheng, MD, PhD Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and Institute of Reproductive Medicine and Developmental Sciences, The University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA NETosis and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are known to be associated with the pathogenesis of various infectious diseases and thrombosis. However, the extends and clinical significance of NETosis and its released plasma markers in patients with SARS-C oV2 infection resulting in severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-1 9) are not fully understood. COVID-1 9 patients on admission were prospectively enrolled for the study. Patients were classified according to WHO guidelines into asymptomatic (control), mild-m oderate (not requiring oxygenation), severe (requiring oxygenation), and critical (multiple organ failure and/or r equiring ventilator). Whole blood anticoagulated with EDTA from each patient was collected. Cells were fixed and stained for flow cytometry analysis following incubation with anti-C itrH3 and anti-M PO, and plasmas were used for as sessing the soluble NETs. By flow cytometry, only few CitH3+/MPO+ positive neutrophils were present in blood of asymptomatic controls on admission. This population of cells dramatically increased in number following stimulation with a bacterial Shigatoxin-2 at 100 ng/mL for 15 min or polyinosinic-p [Poly (I:C)], a TLR3 agonist at 5 for 3 hours. The percentage of CitH3+/MPO+ positive neutrophils in the sample obtained from severe COVID-1 9 patients was significantly higher than that in asymptomatic controls (p=0.021). Interestingly, the percentage of CitH3+/MPO+ positive neutrophils in critical patients was lower than that in severe patients (p=0.013). Moreover, the CitH3+/MPO+ positive neutrophils in asymptomatic patients were more dramatically increased than those in severe/critical patients following stimulation with Poly (I :C ), suggesting a dramatic decrease in neutrophil reserve that could undergo NETosis and fight for infection in severe/critical COVID-1 9 patients. Mi crofluidic shear-b ased assay and confocal imaging analysis further demonstrated an increased formation of NETs strings under flow in whole blood samples from severe COVID-1 9 patients than from asymptomatic controls (p=0.012), which was s ensitive to the cleavage by DNase I. Furthermore, plasma levels of cell free DNA and Histon-D NA complex, the soluble markers of NETs in blood, were also significantly increased in patients with severe and critical COVID-1 9 than those in the asymptomatic controls (p=0.028 and p=0.0073, respectively). Our results demonstrate for the first time that flow cytometry in combination with Poly (I:C) s timulation is a reliable and sensitive assay for assessing the degree and reserve of NETosis in vivo in patients with COVID-1 9 and perhaps other infectious or inflammatory diseases. The percentage of neutrophils undergoing NETosis and the decrease in NETosis reserve following viral infection may c orrelate with disease severity and mortality. DNase I or other NETosis inhibitor may be used for eliminating the excessive NETs which may reduce microvascular thrombosis in patients with severe/critical COVID-1 9. 7 22Potential for weight loss to remediate exposure M.Estefan\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez-A lvarez, Imaobong Inyang, Aileen F. Iowa State University 7,12-d imethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) formed due to combustion of organic material, and it is present environmentally through exhaust fumes, wildfire and cigarette smoke. Cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) and epoxide hydrolase liver to form DMBA -3,4-diol that is further biotransformed by CYP1A1 ,4-diol-1,2-epoxide, a ovotoxic metabolite. Exposure to DMBA can cause follicle loss leading to premature ovarian failure, and other negative reproductive effects. In the US, obesity affects 20% of girls and 40% of women. Obesity can cause infertility, poor oocyte quality, miscarriage, and offspring birth defects. Our group has discovered that obese mice have a compromised ovarian response to DMBA exposure. We investigated if weight loss could remediate the impact of obesity on the ovarian response to DMBA exposure. C57BL/6J female mice aged six weeks were placed in three groups: 1) Lean mice (L; n = 20) fed a chow diet for 12 weeks, 2) obese mice (O; n = 20) fed a HFHS diet for 12 weeks and, 3) a slim-d own group (S; n = 20) fed with HFHS diet for 7 weeks until they had attained a higher body relative to chow-f ed mice on week 7.5 and switched to a chow diet for 5 weeks to ac hieve weight loss. At the end of the dietary treatment period, mice received either corn oil (CT) or DMBA (D; 1 mg/kg) for 7 days via intraperitoneal injection (n = 10/treatment). Body weight was higher (28%) on week 8 between mice on chow and HFHS diets, and on wk 12 the S mice had reversed to the weight level of the L mice. Food intake and body weight were monitored. Mice were euthanized on the second day of diestrus after completion of the dosing. Blood samples and tissues were collected. Weight loss after HFHS diet and exposure to DMBA did not affect the weight of heart, liver, spleen, kidney, or uterus (P > 0.05). However, in S mice, exposure to DMBA increased (P < 0.05) ovary weight, there were no effects on ovary weight in the L and S groups . There was no effect of weight loss or DMBA ex posure on the time s pent at stages of the estrous cycle (P > 0.05) nor any impact on serum progesterone (P > 0.05). LC-M S/MS was performed on isolated ovarian protein for proteomic analysis. In mice that gained weight but slimmed down, 43 proteins were altered (P < 0.1) but relative to mice that remained obese, slimmed mice had 34 proteins that differed (P < 0.1). In response to DMBA exposure, slimmed mice had 119 proteins altered compared with mice that remained obese (P < 0.1), and there were 75 proteins that differe d between lean and slimmed mice who were exposed to DMBA. Taken together, these findings support that weight loss alters the ovarian proteome but does not revert it to that of a lean mouse and that there is potential to weight loss as a therapeutic approach to ameliorate the ovarian response to toxicant exposure. 8 23An environmentally relevant mixture of Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFA S) impacts cell proliferation and steroid hormone levels in primary human granulosa cells. Kendra L. Clark1, John S. Davis1,2 1Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Nebraska Medical C enter Omaha, NE 2Veterans A ffairs N ebraska-W ester n Iowa Health Care System O maha, NE Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of synthetic chemicals that are resistant to biodegradation and are environmentally persistent. PFAS are found in many consumer products including non-s tick cookware, food packaging materials, upholstery, and personal care products. In addition, PFAS are a major source of water and soil contamination. PFAS exposure has been shown to delay menarche, disrupt menstrual cyclicity, cause early menopause via primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), and alter steroid hormone levels in human and animal models . Although virtually 100% of the U.S. population has measurable exposure to several types of PFAS, little research has been done to understand the effects of PFAS mixtures on reproductive health. We previously determined that exposure to a single PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) promotes proliferation and migration in a human granulosa cell line, as well as promoting follicle growth in neonatal mouse ovaries . This study investigated the effects of a PFAS mixture [PFOA, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), (hGC) function, hypothesizing that a PFAS mixture would promote cell growth and impact steroid secretion. Primary hGCs were harvested from follicular aspirates of healthy, reproductive -age women (25-3 5 yr old) who were undergoing oocyte retrieval for in vitro fertilization (n=8). The impact of PFAS exposure on hGC cell proliferation was evaluated by the MTT assay . Cells were cultured with vehicle control (DMSO <0.01% final concentration) or PFAS mixture (L ow nM PFHxS, 7 1 \u00b5M PFOS) for 96h. Increased cell proliferation was observed at both the Low and High mixture (P < 0.05). Immunofluorescent staining with the cellular proliferation marker K I67 and cell cycle analysis via flow cytometry further supported the proliferative action of the PFAS mixture. To measure s teroid hormone secretion, cells were treated with vehicle control or PFAS mixture and androstenedione (500 nM). After 48h, cells with follicle ng (FSH; 30 ng/ml). Media was collected 48h after FSH treatment, and estradiol and progesterone levels were measured from the media of treated cells. The mixture did not impact FSH-s timulated estradiol secretion, though a decrease in basal estradiol secretion was observed in the High PFAS mixture (P < 0.05). The Low PFAS mixture increased both FSH -stimulated and basal progesterone secretion ( P < 0.05). Taken together, these findings suggest that PFAS compounds have the potential to disrupt normal granulosa cell function with possible long-t erm consequences on overall reproductive health. 9 24Loss of proteostasis is a component of I nstitute for M edical Research The female reproductive system is one of the first systems to experience age-related functional decline in mammals . Functional reproductive decline has become a significant burden to modern society, as women have begun to delay childbearing until the advanced years of their reproductive clock. One major contributor to reproductive aging is oocyte quality decline, however the field of reproductive biology has yet to elucidate the mechanisms that govern this phenomenon. In effort to close this gap in knowledge, we conducted single-cell RNA -sequencing (scRNA -seq) of ~50 oocytes each from reproductively young and reproductively old mice in effort to identify novel aging signatures. Downstream analysis of this sequencing revealed age-related differential enrichment of pathways associated with proteostasis . These findings are exciting because are active , long-lived cells; therefore perturbations to proteostasis could be detrimental to their quality. Young oocytes demonstrated elevated levels of genes associated with the ubiquitin proteosome pathway compared to old oocytes . Old oocytes demonstrated elevated levels of genes associated with ribosome activity compared to young oocytes. We hypoth esize biogenesis pathways contribute to oocyte quality decline. To test our hypothesis, we interrogated both pathways at the protein and functional level. Western blots of ubiquitinated proteins in oocytes from reproductively young and old mice indicated statistically significant decline of ubiquitinated proteins with age, supporting the scRNA -seq findings. Additionally, ribosomal RNA transcription and global protein translation decline with age in oocytes, despite higher numbers of ribosomes in the cytoplasm. Together, this data suggests that proteostasis is indeed disrupted age, leading to compromised oocyte quality. Loss of proteostasis is a common feature of aging in other cell types. The findings from our investigation of proteostasis of the aging oocyte could serve as a source of direction for future therapeutic developments to prolong female reproductive function. 10 25Preeclampsia modeling by using trophoblast stem cells derived from umbilical cords of affected infants Sehee Choi1,2, Toshihiko Ezashi3,4, Laura C.

Early-onset PE (EOPE), which usually develops between 20 and 34 w eeks of gestation, causes more severe outcomes than its late -onset counterpart. PE is associated with abnormal trophoblast (TB) development, most usually shallow extravillous trophoblast (EVT) invasion, but defects in cytotrophoblast fusion and altered syncytiotrophoblast (STB) turnover have also been noted. Despite innumerable studies, the pathophysiology of EOPE remains poorly defined largely due to a lack of relevant models to observe its developmental processes. Currently available TB models generated from blastocysts or first trimester placentas cannot predict the disease state since EOPE does not manifest clinically until late in the second trimester and onward. Moreover, for EOPE placentas isolated at delivery, d istinguishing between cause vs effect is problematic. Here, w e present a patient-d erived in vitro trophoblast s tem cell (TSC) model to investigate placental developmental defects in EOPE. Fibroblasts cultured from the umbilical cords of placentas delivered from EOPE pregnancies (male, n=4; female, n=4) and control pregnancies (male, n =4; female, n=3) w ere transfected with (5% O2/5 % CO 2). Following initial culturing in a f ibroblast culture medium for around 2 weeks, the transfected cells on mouse embry onic fibroblasts were transitioned i nto Okae's TSC medium. The first TSC-l ike colonies became visible a t around day 21. Ar eas containing TSC-l ike cells w ere p icked with mechanical dispersion ~four days later f or expansion. A ll colonies within the cultures exhibited complete TSC-l ike morphology by around passage 10. Episomal vector genes were either undetectable or extremely low as judged by qPCR at passage 15. We confirmed t hat the episome-f ree iTSC c ould be differentiated t o either three-dim ensio na l (3D) STB w ith high CGA a nd SDC1 m RNA expression or EVT with h igh HLA-G m RNA expression, d epending on culture conditions. Under the 3D STB differentiation conditions, EOPE lines formed cystic structures with smaller size than those formed in control lines. Furthermore, i nitial experiments on EVT-d ifferentiation in some of the EOPE lines showed blunted outgrowth of spindle-s haped cells and defective invasion in a 3D invasion assay when compared to control lines. We expect that these iTSC models will allow improved exploration of the TB subtype-s pecific defects likely to occur in the process of placentation in EOPE patients that will be disease- a nd even patient-s pecific.

Due to climate change, the risk of in utero heat stress (IUHS) continues to rise , which negatively affects male reproductive development . Male fetuses are reliant on testosterone production from fetal Leydi g cells during the masculinization programming window. Impaired gonadal steroidogenesis during this critical window increases the risk of testicular dysgenesis syndrome, a disorder comprised of male tract malformations (e.g., cryptorchidism, hypospadias), low sperm counts, and testicular cancer. Notably, IUHS reduces the number of pre -spermatogonia in neonatal testes a nd decimates subsequent semen quality by reducing both total sperm counts & increasing the proportion of abnormal sperm . These data suggest that IUHS programs a lifetime of testis dysfunction . The objective of this study was to determine how IUHS affects L eydig cell development and the testicular proteome. Pregnant sows were exposed to either heat stress (28 to 38 \u00b0C; n = 18) or thermal neutral (17 to 22 \u00b0C; n = 18) conditions from day 27 to 57 of gestation. Neonatal boars exposed to IUHS (n = 23) or in ute ro thermal neutral (IUTN; n = 29) conditions were castrated at 3 days of age. Testes were preserved for histological analysis and proteomics. Leydig cells decreased number cells compared to IUTN males Leydig t esticular proteome was interrogated in a subset of animals (n = 8/treatment). A total of 519 testicular proteins (32%) were differentially abundant between IUHS & IUTN testes (278 proteins down -regulated, 241 proteins up -regulated) including proteins important for Sertoli (e.g., insulin - like growth factor binding protein), Leydig (e.g., CYP19), & germ (e.g., glyceraldehyde 3- phosphate dehydrogenase ) cell function. Notably, gene ontology analysis revealed that both steroid & cholesterol biosynthe sis pathways were enriched ( P<0.0001 ) indicating differential Notably , 17 -estradiol) was down -regulated in IUHS testes. Therefore, these data suggest that IUHS leads to Leydig cell dysfunction in boars. The importance of Leydig cells to male reproduction is unequivocal; thus , IUHS represents a new threat to male fertility, especially in the face of climate change. 13 28CDKN1C is a conserved regulator of the invasive trophoblast cell lineage Regan J. Soares1,3,4 1Institute for Reproductive and Developmental Sciences, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS; 2Genomic Medicine Center, Children's Mercy Research Institute, Children's Mercy, Kansas City, MO. 3Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS; 4Center for Perinatal Research, Children's Mercy Research Institute, Children's Mercy, Kansas City, MO. Trophoblast cells of the pl acenta play a key role in complex interactions within the maternal environment that help establish a functional placenta. Adequate placental development, including invasive trophoblast-mediated spiral artery remodeling, is essential for the establishment and maintenance of a healthy pregnancy. Disruptions in placental development can lead to pregnancy complications including miscarriage, intrauterine grown restriction, preeclampsia, and pre-term birth. The mechanisms that drive and regulate the invasive trophoblast cell lineage are not well understood. These regulatory processes occur during early pregnancy, often before adverse symptoms occur, and obtaining tissue and experimental data from first trimester pregnancies is challengi ng. To elucidate the mechanisms regulating the invasive trophoblast lineage, we utilized relevant in vitro and in vivo models, including a human trophoblast stem (TS ) cell line and the rat, respectively. The rat, like the human, exhibits deep trophoblast cell invasion and extensive spiral artery remodeling. Our previous work identified Cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor C (CDKN1C), as a candidate regulator in both human and rat invasive trophoblast cell lineages . This protein is a negative regulator of cell cycle progression, and has been implicated in diseases of pregnancy, including imprinting disorders and hydatidiform mole formation. CDKN1C expression increases in the human TS cell s during differentiation to the EVT cell lineage. We used lentiviral delivery of sh ort hairpin RNAs to silence CDKN1C expression in human CDKN1C expression affected extravillous trophoblast ( EVT) cell differentiation, including disruptions in cell morphology , increased cell proliferation, and changes in the transcriptome. We also identified changes to genome integrity following CDKN1C disruption. CDKN1C is also uniquely expressed in invasive trophoblast cells within the rat uterine-placental interface. To uncover the role CDKN1C plays in rat trophoblast c ell development, we generated a mutant rat model using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Guide RNAs targeting Exon 2 were used to generate a 272 bp deletion within the Cdkn1c locus . This deletion included the translation start site of the protein coding region of Exon 2. Timed pregnancies were obtained from the CDKN1C mutant rat model. Placentation sites were analyzed, and pregnancy outcomes were evaluated. Initial observations suggest disruption of CDKN1C affects placentation and the phenotype of invasive trophoblast cells at the uterine- placental interface. In summary, CDKN1C is a conserved regulator of trophoblast cell differentiation and healthy placental development. [ Supported NRSA -ATPase 4 results in sperm energetic defects. September Numata, Jeffrey McDermott, Gladis Sanchez, and Gustavo Blanco. Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, The University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS. Male factor infertility is a global issue affecting ~8% of couples attempting to conceive. One-third of these males are diagnosed as idiopathic, severely restricting treatment options for these individuals. Limitations on the diagnosis and treatment of male infertility stems from the incomplete understanding of basic mechanisms underlying sperm function. We have previously shown that the testis specific Na,K -ATPase 4 isoform (NKA4 KO ), an ion transporter that exchanges Na+ and K+ across the sperm flagellar membrane, is essential for male fertility . Here, we show that deletion of NKA4 also leads to major defects in sperm metabolism and energetics. Sperm from NKA4 KO mice display an increase in intracellular Na+ and reduced ATP levels compared to WT sperm. These changes a re accompanied by a significant reduction in glucose uptake and a decrease in the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) of NKA4 KO sperm . This suggested the presence of a Na+-dependent glucose uptake mechanism in sperm. We identified the expression of a previously unreported transporter in sperm, the Sodium Glucose Cotransporter Isoform 1 (SGLT-1). Inhibition of SGLT-1 in sperm reduced glucose uptake, glycolytic activity, ATP production, and sperm motility, suggesting that it may contribute to the energetic defects observed in NKA4 KO sperm . In addition, mitochondrial activity was disrupted in sperm from NKA4 KO mice , as demonstrated by a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential and lower oxygen consumption rate (OCR). We also observed an increased ratio of NAD/NADH in NKA4 KO sperm, indicating a shift in the cellular redox state of the cells. Concomitant with these metabolic changes, we found an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species and higher lipid peroxidation in NKA4 KO sperm. Altogether, these findings reveal a novel link between NKA4 activity and sperm metabolism and establish a new mech anism for the control of sperm function and male fertility by NKA4.

During meiosis I, initial spindle positioning at the oocyte's center is critical to protect against aneuploidy, and, later, its timely migration towards the cortex is indispensable for asymmetrical cell division. Depending on the position of the nucleus, the oocytes can be divided into central or peripheral. Peripheral nuclear positioning results in a peripherally -assembled spindle. Recently, we found that peripheral spindle formation is associated with high rates of aneuploidy. Yet, how the spindle behaves when it assembles peripherally is unknown. Given that meiotic oocytes are visua lization has microinjecting cRNAs, encoding fluorescently labeled proteins, into oocytes. This method typically involves pharmacologically arresting oocytes at prophase I for ~3 h to allow sufficient time for fluorescent protein expression and visualization. We now know that these ~3 h also provide sufficient additional time for any peripheral nuclei to migrate centrally. This, in turn, results in a central formation of the spindle in all oocytes by the time of fluorescent imaging, an artificial phenomenon. Therefore, (a) peripheral spindle localization and (b) spindle fluorescence ( i.e. visualization) are currently mutually exclusive. To circumvent this problem, we generated a Centrosomal protein 192 (Cep192) -eGfp reporter CF-1 mouse model to label spindle poles and enable precise spindle tracking, wherever it assembles. Briefly, a construct harboring the EGFP reporter gene was integrated into the genome via CRISPR/Cas9 -mediated homology -directed repair. The EGFP reporter was fused at the C - terminus of the endogenous mouse Cep192. Thus, in this model, CEP192 is just labeled, neither perturbed nor overexpressed. This Cep192-eGfp model enabled us to visualize peripheral spindle behavior without the need for artificial meiotic arrest. Strikingly and importantly, when the spindle forms peripherally, we observed spindle migration towards the center in 73.8% of oocytes, a previously undocumented phenomenon. These oocytes show a lower (P0.01) rate of aneuploidy (12.3\u00b12.9; n=42) vs. those with non-migrated spindles (53.6\u00b17.4; n=36). These migrated spindles remained at the center until chromosome alignment, before re-migrating towards the cortex. These findings indicate that there are two distinct types of spindle migration in mouse oocytes ( i.e. initial spindle migration to the oocyte's center and the later peripheral migration to the cortex) that must be regulated tightly to ensure the fidelity of genome inheritance. 16 31Maternal Thm1 heterozygosity in mice protects palate Hufft -Martinez1, Jeremy P. Goering1, Wislon1, Pamela V. Tran1,2, and Irfan Saadi1,3 1Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, 2Jared Grantham Kidney Institute, 3Institute for Reproductive and Developmental Sciences, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS. Craniofacial anomalies accompany a third of all birth defects, with clefts of the lip and palate (CL/P) being the most common. CL/P have a complex etiology involving both genetic and environmental factors. However, while maternal f olate intake and smoking have been shown to affect CL/P incidence, maternal genetic effects have been difficult to model and study. Mutations in the cytoskeletal gene, SPECC1L, have been identified in patients with CL/P. In mice, in-frame deletion of the coiled- coil domain 2 ( CCD2 ) of SPECC1L causes palate elevation delay , with 50% of mice showing cleft palate (CP ) and 50% showing exencephaly. CP and exencephaly are also common manifestations of ciliopathies, which arise from dysfunction of primary cilia . Indeed, we identified shortened primary cilia in Specc1lCCD2/CCD2 mutant mice, prompting us to examine a potential interaction between Specc1l and the ciliary gene, Thm1. Loss of Thm1 also cause s shortened cilia, and respectively, while showed an increased incidence of ~34% CP , indicating genetic interaction. This CP occurrence was observed when Specc1lCCD2/+ females were crossed with Thm1+/- males. Surprisingly , when parental genotypes were reversed - Thm1+/- females x Specc1lCCD2/+ males - CP was not observed in single or double heterozygous embryos. We next crossed wildtype females with Specc1lCCD2/+ males , and again found ~20% CP in Specc1lCCD2/+ embryos - the same incidence as in Specc1lCCD2/+ females crossed with Thm1+/- males. This parity of ~20% CP in Specc1lCCD2/+ embryos with both crosses ruled out any negative effects from Specc1lCCD2/+ females or Thm1+/- males. These data indicate that Thm1+/- females provide a protective maternal genetic effect against CP. We propose that Thm1 heterozygosity leads to changes in ciliary signaling from maternal tissue that positively influence the fetus. Consistent with this, we found ~3-fold increase in expression of H edgeh og mediator GLI1 in Thm1+/- uterine tissue, and ~ 1.5-fold increase in GLI1 in embryonic placental tissue from Thm1+/- mothers. To our knowledge, a protective maternal genetic effect in a mouse model has not been described for any birth defect. These studies will generate novel insights into the role of maternal environment in the etiology of isolated CP complex disease. 17 J.

Global disruption of AKT1 in the mouse and rat leads to placental and fetal growth restriction. In this project, we sought to explore the involvement of AKT signaling in rat placentation. Our efforts were focused on determining roles for AKT signaling in development of the junctional zone, a placental structure consisting of multiple trophoblast cell lineages, including cells possessing endocrine activities and cells with abilit ies to migrate and transform the uterus. Substrates for AKT1 action in the placenta are not well understood. AKT targets hundreds of different protein substrates that affect a broad spectrum of cellular functions. AKT-mediated phosphorylation can activate or inhibit the function of its substrate proteins. AKT substrates can be identified using antibodies directed to its phosphorylated consensus recognition motif. We have identified AKT substrates within the junctional zone of the rat placenta using an antibody that recognizes a phosphorylated motif present in AKT substrates. AKT s ubstrates were characterized by immunoaffinity, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatic analysis. Using AKT substrate anti body pulldown-mass spectrometry analysis of wild type versus AKT1 null rat junctional zone tissues, we have identified several proteins previously implicated in the regulation of placental development, including dual specificity phosphatase 9 ( interest because its expression is conserved in human and rodents and its expression is dysregulated in obstetrical complications such as preeclampsia. Consequently, we investigated the expression of DUSP9 in the rat placenta. Dusp9 transcripts were expressed in the labyrinth zone, junctional zone, and specifically within invasi ve trophoblast cells of the uterine-placental interface. Single cell RNA - sequence analysis further confirmed the expression of Dusp9 in invasive trophoblast cells. CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing was used to generate a mutant Dusp9 rat model. A 968 bp deletion spanning part of Exons 2 and 3 was generated within the Dusp9 gene. Germ -line transmission was confirmed. This model will be used to investigate the biology of DUSP9 in placentation. Discovery of the identity of AKT substrates and/or proteins associated with AKT substrates will provide insights into the regulatory network controlling development of the junctional zone and invasive trophoblast cell lineage and represent a rich source of information for generating and testing new hypotheses.

Keating Department of Animal Science, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011 Zearalenone (ZEN) is a nonsteroid, estrogenic mycotoxin produced by structurally mimics endogenous estrogen, acting as an endocrine disruptor. Humans are exposed to ZEN orally through contaminated water and food or indirectly through animal by-products. Female ZEN exposure causes precocious puberty, persistent estrus, and reduced fertility. Humans and pigs metabolize ZEN similarly and swine are reproductively sensitive to ZEN. Extreme weather events and global temperatures are increasing in incidence with climate change, inducing heat stress (HS), a metabolic condition in which heat accumulation exceeds heat dissipation increasing body temperature. HS causes intestinal hyperpermeability resulting in metabolic endotoxemia , hyperinsulinemia, and an activated immune response . Utilizing a swine model, this study investigated th e hypothesis that ZEN exposure would alter serum metabolites with a n additive effect of HS . Pre- pubertal female pigs (n = 38) were randomly assigned to one of six treatment groups: thermal neutral (TN) ad libitum fed controls (TC; n = 6); TN ppm; PZ; n = 6); cyclical HS control (HC; n = 7); or HS + ZE N (0.04 ppm; HZ; n = 7) for 7 d. ZEN dosage was chosen based on documented ovarian effects and the NOAEL for humans and was administrated orally in a cookie dough vehicle . Serum (n = 4) was collected on day 7 and analyzed using non- targeted GC -MS. Metabolites were statistically evaluated with an R-based software from MetaboAnalyst 5.0, with important features identified using the univariate analysis tool. Differentially expressed metabolites were identified if the log-fold change > 2 and a P- value 0.05. Fifteen metabolites differed between TC and TZ, 11 were different between PC and PZ, and 25 were altered between H C and H Z. A ZEN effect (P = 0.02) on nonanoic acid, an endogenous anti-fungal metabolite , was increased among treatments. M yo-inositol phosphate, an insulin signaling and glucose metabolism regulator was decreased (P < 0.01) by ZEN exposure during HS . An a nti-inflammatory regulator, L-glutamine (P < 0.01) , and immunomodulator -D-glucose ( P < 0.01) were increased by ZEN exposure in HS pigs. These findings suggest that during HS, ZEN exposure activates metabolites involved with anti-inflammatory and immunoregulation, potentially to compensate for mycotoxin exposure and thermal load in pre -pubertal females. ZEN exposure also reduces metabolites associated with insulin regulation, interesting since HS causes hyperinsulinemia.

This is consistent with previous obs ervations that pluripotent cells utilize glycolysis fo r generation of ATP, while trophoblasts r ely on oxidativ e phosphorylation. However, in pairwise comparisons, while ATP production in control (MRuc5i, MRuc6i, MRuc7i, MRuc8i) iPSCs increased upon differentiation at RucRi) trophoblasts at 5% O 2, ATP did not significantly increase upon differentiation in EOPE cells under c onditions of oxidative stress (20% O 2). There is a positiv e correlation between ATP production and trophoblast invasion at physiological o xygen (5% O2) only in the EOPE group, which indicates that ATP m ay be a driver of invasion under phy siological ox y gen conditions, but other fac tors m ay limit invasion under ox idative stress .

Emily Roberts, Sornakala Ganeshkumar, Elizabeth Thompson, Vargheese Chennathukuzhi. Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS. Our lab has previously shown that the loss of the tumor suppressor REST promotes the activation of PI3K/AKT- mTOR pathway in in uterine leiomyoma. Our recent results indicate that epigenetic silencing of PRICKLE1 , a mediator of non-canonical WNT planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, results in the loss of REST protein expression in the uterus . Moreover, changes in epithelial cell polarity play an important role during embryo implantation. However, PRICKLE1's involvement in planar cell polarity as well as apical -basolateral polarity organization of the endometrium has yet to be investigated. To study the effect of PRICKLE1's loss in vivo, w e recently generated Prickle1f/f Ltf+/icre (Prickle1d/d) conditional knockout mouse model where Prickle1 the endometrial epithelium. Histological analysis of uteri from Prickle1d/d mice showed decreased nuclear expression of REST, c hanges to cell organization, extracellular matrix composition, increased atypia, and irregular endometrial cell polarity . Expression and localization of E-cadherin was altered significantly in the cKO mice with prominent basal localization instead of the normal apico-lateral pattern. In addition, fertility of Prickle1d/d female mice was significantly reduced with litter size of 5.70 (n=23) compared to 9.36 (n=14) in controls (p<0.0001). Moreover, Prick le1d/d mice show activation of the PI3K -AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in the uterus, consistent with observations from human samples of endometrial hyperplasia. Lastly, using single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, we provide evidence for alterations in endometrial epithelial gene expression in the absence of PRICKLE1.

During gestation, maternal and extr aembryonic cells interact at the uterine-placental interface to facilitate critical adaptations for fetal growth and development. T rophoblast stem ( TS) cells differentiate and invade into the uterus where they provide essential contributions to uterine vascular remodeling. TS cell failure to differentiate, invade, and remodel uterine spiral arteries leads to significant obstetrical complications including early pregnancy loss, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm birth. Little is known about the mechanisms driving invasive trophoblast cell lineage development. To identify candidate regulators of the invasive trophoblast cell lineage, our lab performed single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) of the rat uterine-placental We identified follistatin like 3 (FSTL3) as a conserved transcript expressed by invasive trophoblast cell s of both the rat and human. FSTL3 is secreted protein that is an antagonist of activin signaling. Activin is a ligand expressed within the uterine- placental interface. Activin has been implicated in the regulation of trophoblast cell proliferation and differentiation. FSTL3 acts as an activin antagonist by limiting activin access to its receptor. FSTL3 is conspicuous in its production by the placenta and its dysregulation in disorders of pregnancy. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of activin and FSTL3 as regulators of the development and function of the invasive trophoblast cell lineage in vitro using human trophoblast stem (TS) cells and in vivo using a genome edited mutant FSTL3 rat model . Human TS cells can be maintained in the stem state or induced to differentiate into invasive extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells. The rat was selected as a model because, like the human, it exhibits deep intrauterine trophoblast cell invasion and spiral artery remodeling. FSTL3 was prominently expressed in the mid and distal regions of the EVT cell column. In vitro, human TS cells showed a robust induction of FSTL3 expression following differentiation into invasive EVT cells. T o investigate the involvement of activin and FSTL3 in the regulation of human TS cell differentiation into the EVT cell lineage, a FSTL3 loss -of-function model was generated in human TS cells using short hairpin RNAs . We examined the consequences of silencing FSTL3 in the presence or absence of activin on EVT cell differentiation. Disruption of FSTL3 interfered with EVT cell differentiation and enhanced the restraining effects of activin on EVT cell differentiation. To evaluate the role of FSTL3 in development of the invasive trophoblast cell lineage within the rat hemochorial placenta, we generated an Fstl3 null mutation in the rat using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Disruption of FSTL3 resulted in the formation of large cystic -like structures in the junctional zone, the site of invasive trophoblast progenitors, and failure of invasive trophoblast cell (Prl7b1 positive) migration into the uterine placental interface. Collectively, our data support a conserved role for FSTL3 in establishment of the uterine- placental interface. This study enhances our understanding of the invasive trophoblast cell lineage and uterine spiral artery remodeling. Additionally, the proposed research creates a platform for understanding the pathogenesis of diseases impacting placentation.

To initiate meiosis, germ cells activate meiotic gene programs that are critical for the chromosomal events during meiotic prophase, including synapsis and recombination. While retinoic acid (RA) and its germline- specific target STRA8 are necessary for meiotic initiation, they are not sufficient, suggesting that additional stimuli are required for this process. By characterizing a novel molecular function of STRA8 as a suppressor of autophagy, our work reported that an autophagy -inducing factor is engaged in germ cells during meiotic initiation. Nutrient restriction is a potent inducer of autophagy, and, interestingly, commonly known as an inducer of yeast meiosis. Based on this information, we show that nutrient restriction has a potentially conserved role in inducing mammalian meiosis, in that nutrient restriction in combination with RA (NRRA) robustly induces Stra8 -depedent meiotic initiation in mouse spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) culture. Neither nutrient restriction nor RA alone exhibit this effect. Remarkably, meiosis induced in vitro faithfully recapitulates cytological features of in vivo meiosis, including the assembly of the central and lateral elements of synaptonemal complex, the numbers (evaluated by the foci of meiotic recombinases, DMC1 and RAD51) and the (evaluated chromatin immunoprecipitation or ChIP using DMC1 antibody) of meiotic DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) analysis using our single-cell RNA -sequencing (scRNA -seq) dataset revealed that transcriptional profiles of NRRA-induced meiotic initiation and progression closely associate with the stages of meiotic initiation (leptotene) and progression (zygotene and early pachytene) during in vivo spermatogenesis. Thus, our studies identify nutrient restriction as an additional stimulus that works with RA to induce meiotic initiation in mammals, providing a new dimension to characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying meiotic initiation in mammalian germ cells. In the regard, our ongoing effort to delineate the role of RA/STRA8 signaling in this process using Stra8 -deficient SSC culture has revealed an aberrant upregulation of a cluster of transcription factor genes upon NRRA treatment. To determine if genes within this cluster are directly repressed by STRA8, we mined a published ChIP -seq dataset for STRA8-bound genes. By overlapping the genes that are upregulated in Stra8 -deficient SSC culture and are bound by STRA8, we identified 10 genes that are transcriptionally repressed by STRA8, including autophagy regulatory gene, Atf5, and DNA damage-inducible gene, Ddit3. To test whether this STRA8 repression pathway is conserved in vivo , we recently a contralateral Stra8 -deficient juvenile mice. Our integrative analysis has revealed a novel cell cluster in Stra8-deficient testes that is arrested before meiotic prophase and exhibits upregulation of these genes. Together, our study suggests a critical role for STRA8 -mediated transcriptional repression program during meiotic initiation. Of immediate impact, our study facilitates meiotic induction in vitro , a technique that could have tremendous value in research and reproductive medicine.

Wendena Toxicology , and Therapeutics, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, 2Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago IL. Hyaluronan is a ubiquitous glycosaminoglycan, its biological activity is regulated in part by its synthesis and degradation. With advanced reproductive age, ovarian stromal hyaluronan (HA) declines. This coincides with an age-related decrease in HA synthase 3 ( Has3 ), the most abundant HA synthase in the ovarian stroma of CB6F1 mice, and increased ovarian inflammation, collagen content, and increased stiffness . Moreover , ovaries from 5-month-old Has3 knockout (KO) mice on a C57BL/6J background, expressing a catalytically dead H AS3 enzyme, WT) phenocopying the age-dependent increase in ovarian stiffness . Therefore, given the importance of Has3 we hypothesi zed that Has3 KO mice would have accelerated reproductive aging associated with increased inflammation and fibrosis relative to WT mice . We collected whole ovaries or ovarian stromal tissue from Has3 KO and C57BL/6J WT mice in three age cohorts: young (7 weeks), mid (9 months), and advanced (17 months) reproductive age. We first profiled the three HA synthases ( Has1, for HA synthesis and degradation, respectively to determine compensatory changes due to Has3 disruption. Using real-time -PCR, we and Acta2) as we previously showed that these transcripts increased in the ovarian stroma from reproductively old mice. Ovarian collagen fibers were detected in tissue sections using picrosirius red staining, while collagen content was estimated biochemically in whole ovar ies using the hydroxyproline assay . In WT mice, Has3 transcripts were the most abundant and they decreased with reproductive age. In WT and Has3 KO mice, Has2 transcripts declined with reproductive age but there was no difference between age-matched genotypes. Has1 was not different between genotypes at any age. Comparing the four hyaluronidases, Tmem2 was the least abundant and Kiaa1199 was the most abundant hyaluronidase transcript in WT and Has3 KO mice. Additional assessment showed that Kiaa1199 decreased with age but there was no difference between genotypes . Hyal1 and Hyal2 did not change with age or between genotypes. Transcripts for the inflammatory cytokines Il6, Tnfa and Il1b tended to increase with advanced reproductive age in both genotypes . In contrast, the fibro sis-associated transcripts Col1a1, Col3a1 and Acta2, tended to decrease with advanced reproductive age in both genotypes . Collagen staining trended towards an increase with age but was not different between genotypes, and only Has3 KO collagen content trended towards an increase with age . Collectively , transcripts associated with inflammation and fibrosis, as well as collagen staining, were unchanged between age-matched genotypes. T herefore, Has3 KO mice might be altering inflammation and fibrosis reproductive aging parameters due to regulation of these genes at post- transcriptional or post-translational levels or due to the expression of different genes. Additionally, given the trend towards increased collagen content in H as3 KO mice with age, and that Has3 KO ovaries are stiffer than age-matched WT ovaries , studies are ongoing to understand the mechanism by which ovarian stiffness is increasing with age.

In mouse oocytes, spindle positioning is a dynamic process. The spindle is assembled and positioned at the oocyte center until metaphase-I. Such initial central positioning is essential to establish proper kinetochore- microtubule (MT) attachments and to protect against aneuploidy. Later, the centrally located spindle undergoes a dramatic migration towards the cortex, in a time-sensitive manner, a critical process for the highly asymmetric division. In mitotic cells, spindle positioning is governed by the interaction between centrosome-mediated astral MTs and the cell cortex. In contrast, meiotic mammalian oocytes lack classic centrosomes and contain relatively short astral -like MTs. This observation led to the assumption that only F-actin, but not MTs, plays a role in spindle positioning and migration. Recently, we have discovered a new subset of cytoplasmic MT organizing chemical approaches (to manipulate mcMTOC numbers), we have demonstrated a new model of spindle positioning whereby mcMTOC -nucleated MTs anchor the spindle to the cortex exerting an opposing pulling force on the spindle against that of F -actin-mediated force that builds to move the spindle to the cortex for PB extrusion. The balance between these opposing forces ( i.e. mcMTOC -nucleated MTs vs. F-actin) is critical for initial central spindle positioning and timely spindle migration. These results raise the question being how MTs regulate spindle positioning at the molecular level. MT motors are ATP ase-associated proteins that move along the length of MTs and play important roles in regulating MT dynamics necessary for mitotic spindle positioning. However, in mammalian oocytes, the role of MT motor proteins in spindle positioning has not been investi gated. We screened several MT motor proteins in relation to mcMTOC function and spindle positioning. Using time-lapse super -resolution microscopy, we found that dynein localizes to and oocyte cortex only opposite to the PBE side. Perturbation of dynein function by chemical inhibition (1) prevented mcMTOC clustering leading to increased mcMTOC numbers, and (2) decreased mcMTOC -mediated MT nucleation rate and growth. Accordingly, dynein perturbation resulted in abnormal spindle positioning (as evidenced by the increase of the average change of spindle orientation angle and frequent spindle flipping), accelerated spindle migration towards the cortex and increased the incidence of aneuploidy. Interestingly, perturbation of Eg5 kinesin resulted in an opposite phenotype. Eg5 perturbation decreased mcMTOC numbers (by increasing their central movement towards the spindle) and increased their MT nucleation rate and growth leading to the development of long astral -like MTs connecting the spindle directly to the cortex which in turn led to spindle migration failure. Importantly, depolymerizing astral -like MTs by a low concentration of nocodazole fully rescued spindle migration failure in Eg5-perturbed oocytes. Together, these findings suggest that dynein and Eg5 motors drive two antagonistic forces to fine-tune mcMTOC -mediated MT pulling force and provide the first mechanistic insight into mcMTOC -nucleated MT role in directly influencing spindle positioning and timely migration. 25 40Role of indian hedgehog signaling in postnatal ovarian Chakravarthi, Patrick E. Fields, and Mohammad A. Rumi. Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, K S. Ovarian primordial follicles develop in two successive waves. While the 1st wave of primordial follicles are activated immediately after their formation, the 2nd wave of primordial follicles remain dormant and constitute the ovarian reserve. The 2nd wave of primordial follicles are gradually activated to replenish the loss of the 1st wave of ovarian follicles. The cellular and molecular mechanism s that regulate the dormancy of 2nd wave of primordial follicles and allow for their steady activation remain largely unclear. Our recent findings suggest that the activated 1st wave of ovarian follicles may play a regulatory role in these steps . We observed that genetic or drug induced disruption of the transcriptional function of estrogen receptor (ER) results in an excessive activation of primordial follicles in postnatal rat ovaries. Such excessive activation of the 2nd wave of primordial follicles becomes evident as early as postnatal day (PND) 8 and ultimately leads to premature loss of the ovarian reserve in 24-week -old Er knockout young adult rats . To identify the ER -regulated genes that may control the postnatal primordial follicle activation, we analyzed the transcriptome profiles of Er knockout rat ovaries at PND 4, 6, and 8. Among the differentially expressed genes in Er knockout developing ovaries, indian hedgehog ( Ihh) displayed the highest downregulation among the ovary genes. IHH -regulated , and Hsd17b1 were also downregulated in Er knockout rat ovaries. This phenomenon was specific for the transcriptional regulation by ER and responded significantly to treatment with selective ER -agonists and -antagonists. Remarkably , the expression of Ihh did not correlate with the Gdf9 and Bmp15 levels , which are the known regulators of Ihh expression in granulosa cells of activated ovarian follicles. More strikingly, the downregulation of the Ihh gene expression in Er knockout rat ovaries began alleviating after PND 12, when a significant number of 2nd wave of primordial follicles started undergoing activat ion. We detected that unlike the Er knockout 1st wave of follicles, the granulosa cells of activated 2nd wave of follicles expressed the Ihh gene. These observations indicate that the expression of Ihh during the early postnatal ovarian development is ER -dependent only within the 1st wave of ovarian follicles. IHH produced by the 1st wave of ovarian follicles may represent an ER -regulated inhibitory signal that maintains the dormancy of the 2nd wave of primordial follicles.

PTEN is a negative regulator of PI3K signaling and is deficient in > 50% of primary human EC. Amplification of ERBB2 promotes tumorigenesis and pathogenesis of several human cancers. However, the effect of ERBB2 targeting has not been studied in EC with PTEN mutations. Methods: We have developed Pgrcre/+Erbb2f/fPtenf/f (Erbb2d/dPtend/d) mice to evaluate the effect of Erbb2 ablation on EC with Pten deficiency. Histological and molecular analysis was performed for Ptend/d and Erbb2d/dPtend/d mice (n=5/group). Results: At 2 months of age, uterus/body weight ratio for Ptend/d and Erbb2d/dPtend/d mice was not significant . H-Score of mice had EC with (4/5) having myometrial invasion while Erbb2d/dPtend/d mice (3/5) had EC with (2/3) being focal and (2/5) demonstrating hyperplastic appearance. To address the retardation of EC development , histological analysis was performed for Ptend/d and Erbb2d/dPtend/d mice at 2 -weeks of age. Analysis revealed uterus/body weight ratio for Ptend/d (5.05 \u00b1 0.71) and Erbb2d/dPtend/d (7.41 \u00b1 1.09 ) mice displayed significant difference (p<0. 01) while no dissimilarity was noticed in uterus anatomy. H&E staining elucidate d Ptend/d mice (5/5) had endometrial hyperplasia (EH) while Erbb2d/dPtend/d mice were separated into two groups. Erbb2d/dPtend/d group 1 (3/5) had EH and share d close anatomy to Ptend/d mice while Erbb2d/dPtend/d group 2 (2/5) contained more stroma cells and EH was not observed. Both proliferation and apoptosis percentages showed significant difference (p<0.05) between reduction in Erbb2d/dPtend/d group 2 (0.00 \u00b1 0.00%) . The level of pAKT and pERK1/2 were not different among mice. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that Erbb2 ablation reveals a significant suppression of tumorigenesis on EC of Ptend/d mice. Suggesting ERBB2 targeting is an effective therapeutic approach in EC with PTEN deficiency.

Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Women's Health, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211. Six percent of women under 44 are infertile, 12% have difficulty getting pregnant or carrying pregnancies to term, and over 75% of failed pregnancies involve implantation defects. Growth factor receptor -bound protein 2 ( GRB2 ) is an adaptor protein involved in signal transduction and cell communication via binding with receptors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor. To understand the role of GRB2 in the uterus , we generated mice with conditional ablation of Grb2 in the PGR positive cells (Pgrcre/+Grb2f/f; Grb2d/d). Two-month -old female mice were used for fertility test, and uterine samples from pregnant mice were obtained at different days of pregnancy. A 6-month fertility trial revealed that Grb2f/f control mice gave birth with an average of 4.37 \u00b1 0.24 litter per mouse , whereas Grb2d/d mice were sterile . At gestational day (GD) 4.5, implantation sites were not visible in Grb2d/d mice. H&E staining revealed two groups of implantation sites, Group #1 with an open lumen and Group #2 w ith luminal closure. At GD 3.5, cell proliferation in the endometrial epitheli um was significantly increased in Grb2d/d mice compared to control mice. The expression of estrogen target genes was significantly increased in Grb2d/d mice, but the expression of P4 target genes was significantly decreased in Grb2d/d mice. Furthermore, the size of uteri was significantly smaller, and the number of glands was significantly reduced in Grb2d/d mice. Grb2d/d mice were sterile due to defective embryo implantation and decidualization. Our results suggest that GRB2 is critical for endometrial receptivity and implantation . 28 43The Mechanism of of M.D., Ph.D. purpura (iTTP) from inhibitory immunoglobulin that target plasma metalloprotease ADAMTS13 . This leads to the accumulation of ult ra-large multimers of von Willebrand factor (VWF) that occlude the small arterioles and capillaries and cause end -organ damage. To determine whether inhibitory antibodies prevent substrate binding to ADAMTS13, which would increase the substrate concentrat ion at which velocity is half maximal ( the maximal ADAMTS13 by affecting catalytic turnover; or both, we developed an assay using a well -characterized inhibitor of ADAMTS13 to explore this important question. A sin gle chain fragment of the variable region (scFv4 -20) derived from a human monoclonal antibody isolated from an iTTP patient by phage display with potent inhibitory effects on ADAMTS13 was expressed and purified. Recombinant full length ADAMTS13 and native ADAMTS13 in normal human plasma (NHP) were titrated with a fluorescently labeled surrogate substrate (FRETS -VWF73) in the presence of increasing fixed concentrations of scFv4 -20. Titrations were analyzed both individually and applied to a global fit, which allowed for evaluation of the relative eff ects of the inhibitor on Vmax and K0.5. The relative effect of scFv4 -20 on K0.5 was inferred from the global fit via the parameter ; values of within an order of magnitude of unity suggest little to minimal effect of the inhibitor on K0.5. When native ADAMTS13 in normal human plasma was titrated with FRETS -VWF73 in the presence of increasing concentrations of scFv4 -20, the Vmax decreased with increasing concentration of scFv4 -20, but the K0.5 did not show a significant change under the standard assay con ditions (pH 6.0, 25 C). Similar results were observed when acidic conditions closer to physiologically relevant pH and temperature were used. Titration of recombinant ADAMTS13 with FRETS -VWF73 revealed similar results regarding the effect of scFv4 -20 on the Vmax and K0.5. The parameter was close to 1 when the titrations were analyzed by global fit, regardless of the reaction conditions or type of ADAMTS13 used , suggesting little to no effect of scFv4 -20 on K0.5. We conclude that the antibody -mediated inhibition of ADAMTS13 by the inhibitor y scFv4 -20 likely results primarily from reducing catalytic turnover of the enzyme rather than the binding of ADAMTS13 to VWF. Our ongoing study is to determine whether this is a general feature of i nhibitory antibodies against ADAMTS13 or if other inhibitory mechanisms are also involved in the pathophysiology of iTTP. The assay developed and described here can be applicable to explore the way antibodies affect the activity of ADAMTS13 in this polyclo nal autoimmune disease. 29 44Title: Role of WWTR1, a Hippo Signaling pathway component in the development of extravillous trophoblasts via mitochondrial dynamics during mammalian placentation. Institute for Reproductive Health and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas M edical C enter, Kansas City, KS. The mitochondrion is one such organelle which is known to be the main energy provider and the primary source of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), important to maintain cellular homeostasis . Increased exposure to ROS can lead to improper mitochondrial function and alterations in fission and fusion dynamics can affect mitochondrial morphology. This, in turn, can lead to severe placental defects during the early stages of pregnancy, when the placenta is vulnerable and susceptible to cellular oxidative stress or damage. Previously, any alteration in the mitochondrial functioning has been linked to various placental defects like intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preeclampsia or even pregnancy failures. Dysregulation in mitochondrial functioning can have profound effects, particularly on the invading trophoblast population or the extravillous trophoblast cells (EVTs) which are responsible for remodelling the spiral arteries of the mother . This restructuring ensures optimum blood flow to the growing fetus . Our lab has discovered that WW domain containing transcription regulator 1 (WWTR1), a transcription co-f actor and a Hippo signalling pathway component, is required for promoting self-renewal in human cytotrophoblasts ( CTBs ) and plays a crucial role in their differentiation into EVTs. Here, we hypothesize that there might be a mechanistic role of WWTR1 in regulating the differentiation of human TSCs into EVTs via controlling the mitochondrial dynamics. To address the same, we looked into the chang es in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation measured by oxygen consumption rates (OCR) during EVT differentiation as compared to human trophoblast stem cells . OCR rates are indicative of essential parameters of mitochondrial respiration because it shuts down different aspects of the electron transport chain with the help of inhibitors. The metabolic profiles of the two types of trophoblast cells can give an insi ght to any alteration in mitochondrial functions. Investigating whether the loss of WWTR1 leads to the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, increased ROS production and affect oxidative ATP synthesis are some of the future studies. Cumulatively, these findings aim to provide a clear understanding of the function of WWTR1 in fine-tuning the differentiation of EVTs. 30 45Invasive Trophoblast Cell-Natural Killer Cell Cooperation and Michael J. Soares1,2,3 1Institute for Reproductive and Developmental Sciences, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160,2Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160,3Center for Perinatal Research, Children's Mercy Research Institute, Children's Mercy, Kansas City, MO 64108. Natural killer (N K) cells and invasive trophoblast cells have roles in orchestrating the transformation of the uterus, including uterine spiral artery remodeling. In the rat, NK cells enter and expand in number within the post-implantation mesometrial uterine compartment. After mid- gestation, NK cells disappear from the uterine- placental interface as invasive trophoblast cel ls migrate into the uterus. Thus, NK cells and invasive trophoblast cell s cooperat e but act in temporally distinct phases of gestation. In this research, we explore roles for NK cells and invasive trophoblast cell s in transformation of the uterine- placental interface and adaptations that occur in their absence. We used an interleukin 15 (Il15) null rat as a model of NK cell deficiency and a placenta specific 1 ( Plac1 ) mutant rat as a model of invasive trophoblast cell deficiency. Pregnancies with homogenous placental genotypes/phenotypes w ere analyzed. We used four different breeding combinations: 1) wild type (WT ) male x WT female (WT pregnancies); 2) Il15-/- female deficiency in NK cells); 3) WT male x Plac1-/- female (uterine deficiency invasive trophoblast cells); 4) WT male x Plac1-/-, Il15-/- female (uterine deficiency in invasive trophoblast cells and NK cells). Pregnancies were examined on gestation day (gd) 7.5 and gd 18.5. Viable placentas and fetuses were weighed. Mutant placentation sites were examined histologically and through biochemical and molecular analyses. Pregnancy outcomes were evaluated postnatally. Viability and litter size did not differ among the breeding combinations at gd 7.5. At gd 18.5, maternal NK cell deficiency was associated with abnormal ities in intrauterine invasive trophoblast cells, whereas invasive trophoblast cell deficiency was associated with placentomegaly and the retention of NK cells in the uterine mesometrial compartment. Double- deficient pregnancies (absence of uterine NK cells and invasive trophoblast cells) exhibited placentomegaly, fetal growth restriction, and a significant decrease in fetal survival. Postnatal survival was negatively affected in offspring from double mutant pregnancies. In summary, these experiments were focused on cellular dynamics at the uterine-placental -interface. A \"single hit\" affecting either NK cells invasive trophoblast cells (PLAC1 deficiency) affected placental site development; however, a \"double hit\" affect ing both invasive trophoblast cells and NK cells was not limited to the structure of the placentation site but extended to impacts on placental and fetal development and surviv al. These in vivo findings highlight the plasticity hemochorial placentation. [Supported Lalor and accessory subunit function in human myometrial smooth muscle cells. Lindsey N. Juan J. Strand1, Mashal M. Santi1,2 and Sarah K. England1. 1 Center for Reproductive Health Sciences, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, MO, United States, 63110. 2 Department of Neuroscience, Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, United States, 63110. Uterine contracti bility is dependent on the membrane potential of the myometrial smooth muscle cells (MSMCs) which, in turn, is maintained by ion channels. One such channel is Na+ leak channel, non-selective (NALCN) . Recently, it was discovered that the relatively small influx of Na+ through NALCN can activate potassium sodium-activated channel subfamily T member 2 (KCNT2) in myometrial smooth muscle cells. Activation of KCNT2 results in a large efflux of K+, decreasing the resting membrane potential of the cell resulting in hyper -polarization. This hyper - polarization decreases the excitability and therefore contractibility of the myometrium . To further examine the role of NALCN it's expression was knocked down in human MSMCs using shRNA. Following NALCN k nockdown, MSMCs lost the ability to depolarized in response to external Na+ and had altered Ca+ signaling. This indicates that NALCN is a key component in maintaining uterine quiescence. 32 47Transcriptome changes during decidualization of human endometrial stromal cell. Loan Thi Kim Nguyen , Rong Li, Tae Hoon Kim and Jae-Wook Jeong. Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Women's Health, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO. Decidualization plays an important role in cellular proliferation and differentiation of endometrial stroma. Inadequate endometrial decidualization cause s infertility and early pregnancy loss. In this study, we perform ed RNA -sequencing to identify transcriptomic changes during were treated with mixture of estrogen and progesterone to induce decidualization and were harvested on day 0, 1, and 6 after treatment for RNA isolation and RNA -sequencing performance . The transcript level of prolactin ( PRL), a biomarker for decidualization, was significantly increased during decidualization. Comparing day 1 and day 0 after treatment , 2,695 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (1,586 expressed genes (2,632 upregulated and 2,684 downregulated) were changed between day 6 and day 0 . A total of 2,731 DEGs (1,235 upregulated and 1,496 downregulated) were chang ed between day 6 and day 1. Biological pathways related to lipid transport, cAMP -mediated signaling, protein digestion and absorption, and retinol metabolism were upregulated during decidualization. Downregul ated genes were related to ATP-dependent microtubule motor activity, mitotic cell cycle phase transition and protein phosphorylation. A further enhancement of the lipid, collagen, retinol pathway was found at day 6. Reduced synthesis and metabolism pathways were found at day 6 suggesting the cell senesce becomes more obvious at the same time. This study provides the dynamic temporal transcriptome changes and key molecular mechanisms in T_HESC during in vitro decidualization that will improve our knowledge about uterine biology and its functions during pregnancy.

Keating Departm ent of Animal S cience, Iowa S tate University The prevalence of obesity is a growing public health concern, and obesity is inversely proportional to reproductive health indices. The ovotoxicant, dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) compromises oocyte quality leading to premature ovarian senescence and infertility. We have previously discovered that female obese mice have heightened sensitivity to reproductive toxicant exposures, including DMBA, resulting in negative reproductive consequences. The potential for weight reduction to benefit ovarian health has not been explored as it relates to ovotoxicity, thus, this study investigated the hypothesis that weight reduction would ameliorate ovarian damage through changes in metabolic pathways (biological process). C57BL/6J female mice were placed in three groups: 1) Lean mice (L; n = 20) fed a chow diet for 13 weeks, 2) obese mice (O; n = 20) fed a high-f at high sugar ( HFHS) diet for 13 weeks , and 3) a slim-down group (S; n = 20) fed with HFHS diet for 7.5 weeks until they had attained a higher body rel ative to chow-f ed mice and then switch ed to a chow diet for 5.5 weeks to achieve weight loss. At the end of the dietary treatment period, mice received either corn oil (CT) or DMBA (D ; 1 mg/kg) for 7 days via intraperitoneal injection (n = 10/treatment) and were euthanized at the end of dosing on the second day of diestrus. Body weight was 28% (approximately 30%) higher on week eight between mice on chow and HFHS diets, and on week thirteen the S mice had reversed to the weight level of the L mice. Total protein (n = 5) was isolated and analyzed through LC -MS/MS. KEGG pathways and enrichment analysis were used to identify differentially abundant proteins. In the L mice , six proteins were enriched in metabolic pathways due to DMBA exposure as compared to the control (P < 0.1). In the S mice , DMBA altered the abundance of ten proteins , including GSTP1, involve d in metabolic pathways as compared to the control ( P < 0.05). However, in the O mice , only one gene was enriched in metabolic pathways due to DMBA exposure ( P < 0.05). Panther analysis for biological processes enriched by DMBA exposure in the L mice included response to stimulus, cellular and metabolic processes. Ovaries of S mice were enriched for biological regulation, localization, cellular , and metabolic processes. Phase 1 (EPHX2) and phase 2 (GSTP1 & GSTMU1) xenobiotics biotransformation proteins were altered in the lean, obese, and slim mice due to DMBA exposure. In summary, this finding supports the hypothesis that weight loss may ameliorate obesity -induced ovarian damage through compensatory mechanism s including changes to biological processes and metabolic pathways.

Keating Departm ent of Animal S cience, Iowa S tate University Lifestyle and env ironmental factors, such as obesity and ovotoxicant exposure, reduce female fertility. Obesity is associated with poor oocyte quality which limits female reproductive capacity by reducing conception and implantation. 7,12-d imethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) created through the combustion of organic material. Known ovotoxicants, PAHs result in female infertility through DNA damage. Due to previous findings of DNA damage and a reduced ovarian protective response to ovotoxicant exposure in hyperphagia- induced obese relative to lean mice, this study investigated the hypothesis that a blunted response to DMBA exposure would occur in a di et-induced model of obesity. At six weeks of age, female C57BL6J mice were fed either a normal rodent diet containing 3.5% kCal from fat (lean; n = 20), or a high fat high sucrose diet comprised of 45% kCal from fat and 20% kCal from sucrose (HFHS ; n = 20). All mice were fed ad libitum until the HFHS mice attained a 30% increase in body weight compared to the lean mice, at which time each diet group was divided and injected with corn oil as vehicle control (CT) or 1 mg/kg DMBA for 7 d. Vaginal cytology was performed starting at dosing onset until euthanasia at day two of diestrus. Body, ovary, uterus, spleen, and liver weights were collected. One ovary was utilized for follicle classification and enumeration. Protein was isolated from the second ovary for LC -MS/MS analysis. Body weight was increased (P < 0.05) by the HFHS diet but DMBA exposure had no effect. Liver weight was increased (P < 0.05) in the HFHS DMBA (0.96g \u00b1 0. 04) compared to lean DMBA (0.80g \u00b1 0.04) with no difference in the CT treated Lean or HFHS groups . There was no treatment effect (P > 0.05) on ovary , uterine, or spleen weight s, nor any effect ( P > 0.05) on estrous cyclicity or circulating 17 -estradiol or progesterone. Primordial follicles were higher (P < 0.05) in HFHS C T (386.0 \u00b1 24.9) compared to Lean CT (279.2 \u00b1 58.3) mice , while there was a tendency ( P < 0.1) for higher primordial follicle number in DMBA expos HFHS mice < 0.05) antral follicle number (6.7 \u00b1 2.5) compared to Lean DMBA exposed mice (2.6 \u00b1 0.8) were recorded. There was no treatment effect ( P > 0.1) on remaining follicular stages, or corpus lutea . HFHS diet altered (P < 0.05) 80 proteins in CT treated mice, while only 14 proteins were altered ( P < 0.05) by DMBA exposure in HFHS compared to Lean mice. Exposure to DMBA exposure altered ( P < 0.05) 49 proteins in Lean mice , with only affected 4 proteins ( P < 0.05) in HFHS mice. These findings support the posit that the ovary of an obese female responds differently than a lean female to a genotoxicant exposure.

Abnormal placentation is associated with varieties of pregnancy complications such as, fetal growth restriction and preeclampsia. The critical cellular processes of TCs are modulated by transcriptional, epigenetic and metabolic regulators, which are, generated by protein translation modifications (PTMs) . Due to experimental impediment , the molecular mechanism of PTM regulators in the mammalian placentation remained elusive. Protein arginine methylation is one of the PTMs and PRMT1 is the most predominant enzymes. Interestingly, the investigation of PRMT1 in knockout mouse embryos resulted in embryonic lethality, prior to E6.5, a development stage equivalent to early 1st trimester in humans. However, the importance of PRMT1 in post implantation mouse or human placentation has not been addressed. We checked the protein expression of PRMT1 in different mouse embryonic stages, human placenta stages and human trophoblast stem cells (hTSCs). PRMT1 is expressed in the villous cytotrophoblasts (CTBs) and extra villous cytotrophoblasts (EVT) within 1st trimester and CTBs in term human placenta. Also, the hTSCs strong ly expresses nucl ear localization of PRMT1. As it differentiates to EVT and syncytiotrophoblasts, there is a gradual decrease in its mRNA expression. Checking of expression in mouse embryonic stages is in queue. Parallelly, the deletion of PRMT1 in hTSCs via RNAi is being carried on and cell type specific knockout by Cre Recombinase in mouse model are planned. Overall, the study aims in understanding the role of arginine methylation proteins in trophoblast lineage development and function. 36 51c-Myc supports polyploidy and Jennifer L. Gerton1,2 1 Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, USA 2 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City , USA Placenta is essential for reproductive success and p lacental abnormalities are the leading cause of low birth weight and preterm birth. The p lacenta includes polyploid cell s that are crucial for its function. Polyploidy occurs broadly in nature but the regulators that enable polyploidy to arise in a spatio temporally regulated manner in the placenta are unknown. Trophoblast giant cel ls are recognized as the main polyploid cell type in murine placenta. We discovered that in addition to trophoblast giant cells, most murine placental cell types are polyploid, suggesting that the entire placental environment is permissive for polyploidy. To discover factors that permit polyploidy broadly, w e identified pathways upregulated in polyploid placental cell types using single -cell RNA seq . We identified c-Myc as a key regulator of polyploidy during placental development . Using c-Myc null mice, we f ocused on trophoblast giant cells, which undergo multiple rounds of DNA replication via endocycles , showed role of c-Myc in regulation of replication genes and cytokines signaling in these cells . We observed increased DNA damage and senescence in the c- Myc null trophoblast giant cells primarily due to reduced expression of replication genes . Loss of c-Myc in the placenta also impacts the neighboring maternally derived decidua, pre sumably via paracrine effects. These data reveal an essential role for c-Myc in supporting endocycles and polyploidy during normal placental development , thereby preventing trophoblast giant cells and neighboring maternal decidua from premature senescence. Our study combined with the literature suggests c-Myc is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of polyploidy and suggests how c-Myc may act as an oncogene . 37 52Antenatal corticosteroid therapy for prevention of preterm birth complications significantly 1Department of Biomedical Sciences. University of Missouri Kansas City School of Medicine, Kansas City, MO. 2Department of Pharmacology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA. Background: Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal mortality. Antenatal corticosteroid therapy (ACS) is administered to pregnant individuals at risk for delivery prior to 37 weeks gestation to prevent a multitude of complications, such as respiratory distress syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage, and mortality. The goal of ACS is to reach maximum efficacy prior to delivery, which occurs 2-7 days following the first dose. Neonates exposed to corticosteroids greater t han 14 days prior to delivery are at an increased risk for neonatal and early c hildhood morbidity. However, prediction of delivery time is a difficult task. Currently, approximately 50% of pregnant individuals who receive ACS deliver at or following 35 weeks gestation (late preterm). In children who received ACS and are born at late preterm or term, there is higher risk of neurocognitive and psychological impairment. Given this information, we sought to determine how ACS alters gene expression and associated neurological and immunological phenotypes. We hypothesize that antenatal exposure to ACS will alter transcriptional responses leading to long term changes in the developing brain and adult behavior. Approach: Human umbilical cord blood was collected following delivery of 15 neonates, seven of which were administered betamethasone while in-u tero to prevent complications from preterm birth. RHA was purified and used to examine the entire expressed genome using the Clariom S Affymetrix GeneChip assay. Qiagen Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was utilized to examine gene expression profiles and canonical pathways of highly altered genes in these neonates. Results: 530 genes were significantly altered in treated versus untreated controls. 280 genes were upregulated and 250 were significantly down regulated. Of importance, several genes involved in immune response, cell proliferation, members of the solute carrier protein families, neurogenesis and neuronal maturation were altered. IPA analyses indicate that Th1 and Th2 signaling is predicted to be activated while the antiproliferative role of TOB is inhibited. Disease processes predicted to be altered include inhibition of cancer progression, activation of hematopoietic pr ogenitors, reduced brain size and abnormal development of pons, mossy fibers and diencephalon. Conclusions: Whole transcriptomic comparisons to betamethasone treated versus control infants born prematurely indicate that a number of signaling pathways essential for immunological and neurological pathways are altered. These studies are the first steps to identify biomarkers of potential future pathological processes that are permanently altered in response to antenatal corticosteroid exposure. 38 53Association of Serum Kisspeptin Levels and Pregnancy Outcomes in Assisted Reproductive Technology Presenting Author: Elaine Phillips, School of Medicine Mentor: Courtney Marsh, produced cells, has been hypothesized to regulate successful placental implantation. Several studies have show n a positive correlation between maternal serum Kisspeptin levels and successful pregnancy outcomes in second and third trimester pregnancy, but trends in early pregnancy have not been well established . It has also been suggested that Kisspeptin helps stimulate progesterone production by granulosa cells. In this prospective case control study, we examine how Kisspeptin levels correlate to serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (bHCG), progesterone, and pregnancy outcomes at the time of pregnancy t esting in cis gendered females undergoing assisted reproductive technology. Pregnancy testing occurred an average of 33 days after last menstrual period for non -IVF protocols and an average of 12 days after blastocyst transfer for IVF protocols . Outcome gr oups included: viable first miscarriage (n=12), (n=5), biochemical pregnancy (n=16), and not pregnant (n=12). Kisspeptin values did not show significant difference between outcome groups. There was not fo und to be a significant correlation between kisspeptin and bHCG, nor kisspeptin and measured progesterone value or by administration of exogenous progesterone regardless of administration route . Due to the small sample size, no statistically signi ficant correlations have emerged. Based on our current findings , kisspeptin is not of clinical diagnostic utility in early first trimester pregnancy likely due to dual production of kisspeptin by decidua and placenta .

Keating Department of T oxicology, I owa St ate University Ovotoxicant exp osures can impair female fertility through altered germline quali ty, endocrine disruption and hydrocarbon 7,12- dimethylbenz [a]anthracene (DMBA) is liberated through combustion of organic material and is a germline genotoxicant. Ataxia Mutated Telangiectasia (ATM) is a germline protector and females deficient in ATM have an altered ability to response t o DNA damage. This study investigated the hypothesis that pharmacologic al inhibition of ATM would be additive to DMBA -induced ovotoxicity. Twenty adult C57BI6 female mice were divided into four groups and by intraperitoneal injection received either corn oil as vehicle control, DMB A (1mg/kg), ATMi (25mg/kg) for 7 d. Body and organ weights were recorded and an alyzed. Exposure to DMBA reduced ( P < 0.05) body wei ght relativ e to CT and ATMi mice. Inclusion of the ATMi with DMBA exposure did not rescue the reduction in body weight caused by DMBA exposure. Ther e was no effect of DMBA exposure on ovary weight relative to CT mice, however, both groups that received the ATMi tended to have greater ( P = 0.1) ovary weight than the CT or DMBA treated mice. Uterus weight w as reduced ( P < 0.05) by DMBA exposure relative to CT treated mice, but inclusion of the ATMi prevented this DMBA effect on uterine weight. Thus, these findings support that inhibition of ATM during DMBA ex posure has additional effects that could be attributed to altered DNA re pair. 40 55The effect of maternal myostatin on the maternal-fetal metabolome. Ruth Opoku, Jenna DeCata, Charlotte Phillips and Laura Schulz. Division of Biological Sciences, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Women's Health, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA Background: Myostatin is a member of the transforming growth factor -beta (TGF-B) super - family, and it functions as a negative regulator of muscle development and a modulator of metabolism. We have previously shown that wildtype (WT) pups born to myostatin deficient moms (Mstn+/-) weighed 25% more than WT pups from WT dams and that they have greater muscle mass and bone biomechanical strength as adults. We have also shown that maternal myostatin does not cross the placenta, indicating that the mother's myostatin must act on maternal or placental tissues, not directly on fetal tissues. The placenta could play a role in causing the higher fetal body masses in myostatin-deficient dams by transporting more nutrients to the fetus. Cross -sectional area of the labyrinth zone is increased in placentas from Mstn+/- dams. The goal of the present study is to determine the metabolomic changes that are present in the fetal and maternal serum and placenta to see how maternal myostatin deficiency affects the transfer of nutrients across the placenta. Experimental Design: In this study, we performed reciprocal crosses of WT and Mstn+/- parents With WT dams serving as controls for the Mstn+/-dams. We examined maternal serum and pooled fetal serum from each pregnant dam (n=8 WT and 8 Mstn+/-), and one male placenta per litter (n=14) on day 17.5 of gestation. Global metabolomic profile was determined from our experimental groups by Metabolon. Welch's two sample t-test was used to determine whether metabolites in the two populations were different in the placental analyses. Two-way ANOVA repeat measures and random forest analysis was used to determine the difference in population of metabolites in the fetal and maternal blood serum. Results and Conclusion: There were 704 metabolites that differed in concentration in the serum between WT dams and their fetuses (393 upregulated and 311 downregulated). In Mstn+/- dams, 682 metabolites were different between fetal and maternal serum (412 upregulated and, 270 downregulated). In maternal serum, 33 metabolites were different between Mstn+/- and WT dams (17 upregulated and 16 downregulated). Between fetal sera from Mstn+/- and WT dams, 50 metabolites were different (40 upregulated and 10 downregulated). When it came to WT placentas from Mstn+/- and WT moms, 27 biochemicals were different (four upregulated 23 The branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), valine, leucine, and isoleucine are essential amino acids important in physiological response to stress, energy production, and for the normal metabolism and health of muscle. Biochemicals in this class are significantly decreased in the placental tissue collected from Mstn+/- dams compared to WT dams but were significantly increased in the fetal serum from Mstn+/- dams. Lysophospholipids are components of the cell membrane and local mediators that regulate development, tissue regeneration and homoeostasis, and are precursors for lipid synthesis. Some lysophospholipids were significantly increased in fetal serum from Mstn+/- dams but were significantly decreased in their placentas. Pups from Mstn+/ - mothers have significantly higher metabolites in their serum and its significantly decreased in their placenta compared to pups from WT mothers 41 56In silico Protein Characterization of the Epididymis for Determining Potential Immunocontraception Targets Bikikoro Kenitimi G . Department of Medical Laboratory Science, Faculty of Basic Medical Science, College of Health Science, Niger Delta University, Wilberforce Island, Nigeria. Background: The epididymis is a tissue of interest for the development of novel male contraceptives since it is where spermatozoa mature in an immune-privileged site, and gain the ability to capacitate and undergo the acrosome reaction, two functions crucial to the fertilization of an oocyte. Immunocontraception is an approach that involves the development of contraceptive vaccines that leverages the immune system in order to prevent fertilization by inhibiting the function of target proteins involved in gamete production & maturation. Although there are some unknowns at the time, such as immune response variations, immunocontraception remains a promising approach with merits of the absence of hormonal disturbance, and the avoidance of irreversible procedures such as vasectomy for men. To explore the opportunities and understand the complexities of the epididymis as a tissue of interest with possible immunocontraception target proteins, an in silico approach involving the use of several integrated computational tools for the functional annotation of epididymis associated proteins was conducted. Methodology: The study conducted a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis using tools including but not limited to ProtParam, Immune Epitope Database (IEDB), and UniProt for 10 as potential immunocontraceptive targets. Result: To appropriately establish whether the chosen proteins can offer a high level of contraceptive efficacy, the properties of allergenicity, antigenicity, peptide toxicity, projected antigen-antibody affinity, T-cell, and B-cell epitopes were determined for each target protein. The findings suggest that a multi -antigen contraceptive vaccine will be more effective because no single protein met all of the immunogenic requirements of a target antigen to function as a vaccin e to control fertility. Conclusion: This work investigated potential targets for the development of immunocontraceptives for men, demonstrating the role and impact of computational tools and techniques in accelerating potential male contraceptive discovery in specific tissues such as the epididymis. Further wet- lab investigation of identified targets will be required to evaluate and capitalize on their potential to develop a multi -antigen fertility regulating vaccine as specific avenues towards contraceptives for men. 42 57Na,K-ATPase 4 Undergoes Phosphorylation During Sperm Capacitation Kristen M. Schwingen, Jarrid L. Jack, and Gustavo Blanco Departm ent of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, The University of Kansas M edical C enter , Kansas C ity, KS. Na,K-ATPas e 4 (AT P1A4) i s an integral plasm a membrane protein responsibl e for the exchange of N a+ and K+ between the cell and its environment. ATP1A4 is onl y found in male germ c ells o f the testes and spermatoz oa, where it is necessary for sperm m otility and sperm capacitation. AT P1A4 activity is regulated during sperm c apacitation in vitro. Here, using immunoprecipitation and i mmunoblot anal ysis, we show that ATP1A4 from r at sperm i s phosphorylated, both under non-c apacitated and c apacitated c onditions . However, we found differences in the levels and the pattern of protein phosphorylation between both conditions. Specifically , ATP1A4 phosphorylation of Tyrosine tant, when non-c apacitated and capacitated samples were compared. These results w ere confirmed by us ing tandem m ass s pectroscopy (MS/MS). These data show that ATP1A4 i s pos ttranslationally m odified by ph osphate add ition and that the protein is subjected to a complex pat tern of phosphorylation that depends on the state of the cells. In addi tion, they sugges t that regulatory m echanisms ar e operating to adjust ATP1A4 to the functional needs of the male gamete.

Preterm birth puts infants at an i ncreased risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) which is the major cause of neonatal morbidity. Administration of glucocorticoids (GC) during pregnancy is a standard treatment to prevent the development of lung morbidity. Antenatal glucocorticoid promotes lung maturation and provides anti-inflammatory benefit. However, glucocorticoids cause adverse side effects such as altering the brain's development, hypomyelination, and decreased birth weight. GC may help acutely, but the long-term effects are not well understood. Dexamethasone is a commonly used GC that may increase the long-term risk of cerebral palsy. Ciclesonide is a synthetic GC that is used to treat asthma in children over the age of 5 years old. Ciclesonide is a prodrug that is metaboli zed to an active for by an enzyme, Carboxylesterase, that is predominantly expressed in the lungs leadi ng and has been shown to lead to less systemic effects. We therefore hypothesized that Ciclesonide may be a safer sGc alternative for treating pre-term lung immaturity while limiting the neurological side effects and maintaining normal body weight. To understand the effects of GC on myelination and risk for cerebral palsy, we compared the effects of prenatal dexamethasone or ciclesonide administration on white matter formation in mouse embryos. We first evaluated the direct genomic effects of each drug or vehicle on transcription using whole genome microarray screening. Primary neural stem cells were isolated from the cerebral cortices of embryonic day 14 brains, and exposed to 10 -7M vehicle, Dexamethasone, or Ciclesonide for four hours. RNA was isolated, converted to single strand cDNA and hybridized to Affymetrix Clariom S gene chips containing 25,000 genes. 556 genes were significantly altered by Des compared to Dex. 281 genes were uniquely activated (>40% increase) by Ciclesonide comp ared to Dex with 165 (>40% decreased). Genes altered include signaling molecules and genes involved in progenitor proliferation and neural development. To understand the in-vivo consequences of thes e alterations, pregnant mice were administered intraperitoneal 10 -7M vehicle, D examethasone, or Ciclesonide at embryonic day 14 and then euthanized at embryonic day 17. The embryo brains were processed and sectioned and stained for markers of oligodendrocyte specific developmental stages. The location and quantity of developing oligodendrocytes was compared in the brain using statistical software (Graphpad). Preliminary findings suggest that the dexamethasone and ciclesonide produce distinct biological alterations in the developing brain oligodendrocytes development present at E17. Future studies are aimed at determining the long-term consequences on myelination. 44 59The contribution of a REST-miRNA tissue remodeling cascade to adenomyosis pathophysiology. Riley Peterson, Amanda Graham, Warren Nothnick. Institute for Reproductive and Developmental Sciences, Department of Cell Biolog y and Physiology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS. Adenomyosi s is a non-neoplastic uterine disease that invol ves the invasion of endometrial glands and stroma int o the myometrium of the uterus. Adenomyosi s is believed to affect between 25-65 % of pre- menopausal women worldwide. Symptom s of adenomyosis inflict a poor quality of lif e through severe pelvi c pain, inflammation, menorrhagia, and infertility. The pathophysiolog y of adenomyosi s remains vastl y unidentifie d, emphasizing a significant gap in knowledg e. A widel y accepted postulation is that tissue remodeling an d repair mechanisms are becoming dysregulated to lead to unregulated proliferation, invasion, and migration of endometrial glands and strom a into the myometrium, resulting in adenomyosis. While there are strong speculations regarding adenomyosi s development, there remains a significant lack of knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms involved in the onset and maintenance of adenomyosis. Preliminar y studi es unveiled a candidate gene, neuron-restrictive silencer transcription factor/RE 1 (REST), as a geneti c driver involved in adenomyosi s development. REST has a primary function a s a transcriptional repressor of neuronal gene s in all non-neuronal cells. It is hypothesized that RES T functions i n the uterus as both a neuronal gene suppressor and a repressor of gene transcription contributing to uterine health. Preliminary studies revealed a significant reduction of REST expression in adenomyotic foci and eutopi c uterine tissue in women with adenomyosis, suggesting a potential role in disease pathophysiology. Further, reversion inducting cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs, or RECK, was identified as a downstream target of RES T. REST is proposed to regulate miR- 137-3p expression such that loss of REST may elevat e miR- 137-3p expression. It i s suspected that miR- 137-3p targets RECK f or degradation, leading t o a reduction of expression. In the current study, we began to dissect this mechanism using full uterine cr oss section s from women with and without adenomyosi s (N=6/group). REST and RECK were localized by immunohistochemistry. In uteri from adenomyosis study subjects, REST expression w as reduced in myometrium, endometrial glands and strom a from adenomyosi s subjects. RECK was not detectabl e in endometrial glands from uteri of either adenomyosi s or control subjects. We conclude that both REST and RECK expression is reduced i n uterine tissue of women with adenomyosi s and reduced expression of RECK may lead to elevated matri x metalloproteinase (MMP) expression and tissue remodeling necessary for adenomyosi s development. Ongoing and future studies ar e evaluating the role of miR- 137-3p in this pathway as well as identifyin g those MMPs involved in adenomyosis pathophysiology.

The outcome of pregnancy with T-21 is heterogenous. Many of those pregnancies need medical termination, whereas baby s born with T-21 suffer from Down Syndrome, associated with physical and mental disabilities and shorten life expectancy. However, how T-21 affects trophoblast development/function and placentation is almost unknown. The T-21 of a developing fetus is often tested via chorionic villous sampling ( CVS). In this study, we used a novel strategy, in which we isolated CTBs from residual tissues from CVS and established patient-d erived human trophoblast stem cell ( TSC) lines. Unexpectedly , our initial analysis of these TSC lines compared to that of normal TSC line, revealed that T-2 1 affects both self- renewal capacity and proliferate very slow. Further analysis of these cell lines reveals that the markers for EVT differentiation such as ACL2, HLA -G and MMP2 are getting affected. The maternal immune system recognizes and tolerates the allogenic fetus thus leading to a successful pregnancy. Abnormal crosstalk between the trophoblast cells and decidual immune cells may result in pregnancy complications. Here, we show that T-21 induces expression of human leucocyte antigen-A (HLA-A) in human trophoblast cells. We also report that trophoblast cells from T-21 induces the expression of certain immune markers such as CD25 in T cells and CD107 in Natural Killer cells , thereby making them a target for maternal immune system . GATA3 and RUNX1 (a gene present in the Down syndrome critical region on Chromosome 21) are critical regulators of trophoblast development. He we show an antagonist relationship between the two factors with a loss of GATA3 and a gain of RUNX1, that is involved in the development of trophoblast cells. 47 62Changes in cortical endoplasmic reticulum clusters in the fertilized mouse oocyte.

The mechanism underlying autoantibody formation and pathogenesis of iTTP are not fully understood. Our lab previously reported a strong association between the mutations in the A NKRD36 family genes and iTTP. To further understand the role of ANKRD 36 in iTTP , we established a partial deletion mutant of Ankrd36 protein in mice, which were bred with Ada mts13-/- mice. The role of Ankrd36 in TTP phenotype and immunological responses to potential viral infection was acid [Poly (I:C)] via intraperitoneal injection. Complete blood count in anti -coagulated w hole blood was performed at baseline, 4, 24, and 72 h of post-challenge. Major organ tissue s were collected for histology, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometric analyses at baseline or 72 h following Poly (I:C) injection. All mice at baseline did not exhibit thrombocytopenia. Seventy -two hours following challenge with Poly (I:C), platelet counts were significantly reduced in A13-/- with or without AK36-/- but not in AK36-/- alone mice compared with those in WT controls. Interestingly, the median platelet counts appeared to be the lowest in AK36+/-A13-/- among all groups. Histology and immunohistochemical analyses revealed occlusive thrombi in terminal arterioles as exemplified the positive staining with anti -VWF or anti -fibrinogen IgG 72 hours following Poly (I:C) challenge. Moreover, our histological analysis demonstrated a consis tent drop in the percentage of splenic white pulp following Poly (I:C) treatment in all genotypes with the most dramatic drop in the WT, followed by the AK36-/-A13-/-, then the A13-/- and AK36-/- mice . Immunohistochemical staining of spleen tissue revealed a significant increase in both B and T cells in the red pulp, which led us to conduct the flow cytometrical experiments. Our flow results demonstrated that following Poly (I:C) treatment the percentage of CD3+ T cells, CD3+CD8+ natural killer cells, CD138+ plasma cells, and CD11b+F4/80+ macrophages decrease d, while the percentage of B cells increased . Specifically, within the T cell population, CD3+CD4+ helper T cells increased while natural killer T cel ls decreased . In all cell types except for macrophages, the AK36-/- group shows no change from the wild type. Interestingly, our AK36-/-A13-/- mice showed similar or more profound changes compared to the WT mice in all cell types. Our results demonstrate for the first time a synergistic role of partial deletion of AKRD36 protein in pathogenesis of TTP resulting from severe plasma ADAMTS13 deficiency and potential viral infection. Additionally, our results indicate that the ANKRD36 f amily proteins may play a regulatory role in the immune and inflammatory response. Further investigation of the interaction between ANKRD36 family protein and ADAMTS13 may help understand the pathogenesis of TTP and other immunoinflammatory disorders. 49 64Early life stress impacts the mouse uterine transcriptome . Paige Minchella , Warren B. Nothnick . Institute for Reproductive and Developmental Sciences, Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS. Psychological stress has been identified as a common factor among uterine pathologies and reproductive disorders. While reproductive dysfunction is associated with increased depression and anxiety, recent research has shed light on stress a s both a consequence and driver behind disease development . Stress during critical developmental periods early in childhood can result in biological changes that lead to poor physical outcomes in adulthood. Many studies have linked early life stress (ELS) to increased risk for developing endometriosis and uterine fi broids, as well as suffering from subfertility/infertility, irregular menses, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), vaginal hyperalgesia, and chronic pelvic pain. Despite growing evidence supporting the role of psychological stress impacting reproduction , little re search provides mechanistic insights into how stress alters uterine environment leading to dysfunction. The objective of our study was to observe changes in the uterine environment following ELS that may suggest vulnerability or increased risk for developm ent of uterine pathologies and reproductive disorders. To begin to address this gap in knowledge, we used a well -established mouse model representative of ELS in humans (NMS; Neonatal Maternal Separation) to characterize the mouse uterine transcriptome. Using RNA sequencing, o ur findings indicate that ELS impacts the mouse uterine transcriptome by significantly changing the expression levels of genes that, when dysregulated, have the potential to lead to uterine dysfunction. We identified 51 genes, 20 upregulated and 31 downregulated, in uterine tissue of NMS mice as compared to Na\u00efve controls. Further investigation is needed to confirm the alterations of these genes in the uterus and potential impact on protein expression, ut erine environment, receptivity, and reproductive function . We will continue to use this mouse model to observe if our NMS mice develop a distinct reproductive phenotype. Clinically, understanding the impact psychological stress has on reproduction could re veal mechanisms of stress -induced changes in uterine function , origins of disease, and provide insights for better therapeutic interventions . 50 65CITED CO-REGULATORS, PLACENTATION, Soares1,2,3 1Institute for Reproductive and Developmental Sciences, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS ; 2Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS ; 3Center for Perinatal Research, Children's Mercy Research Institute, Children's Mercy, Kansas City, MO Successful placentati on depends on the development of specialized trophoblast cells with the ability to enter and transform the uterine environment. These cells are called invasive trophoblast cells in the rat and extravillous trophoblast ( EVT) acid-rich acts as a transcriptional co -regulator and contributes to the regulation of trophoblast cell differentiation. We examined how CITED2 regulates placental development, both in rat and in human, and have established experimental tools for assessing the involvement of its paralog, CITED1 , in these processes . CITED co was assessed in human trophoblast stem ( TS) cells and human and rat placentation sites. We utilized loss -of function approaches to investigate roles for CITED co -regulators in human TS cells and rat placentation sites. Lentiviral delivery of Cited2- specific shRNAs was used in human TS cells and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing was used to establish Cited2 and Cited1 m utant rat models. We determined morphological, biochemical, and molecular parameters of trophoblast cell differentiation and placentation. CITED2 exhibits an EVT c ell differentiation dependent increase in expression in human TS cells. CITED2 transcript levels are low following syncytiotrophoblast differentiation. The EVT cell column is a prominent source of CITED2. CITED1 expression in human TS cells in the stem state or following differentiation are low. The rat placentation site exhibits high expression of Cited2 in the junctional zone and invasive trophoblast cells of the rat uterine-placental interface. On the other hand, Cited1 is expressed throughout the rat placentation site, including the labyrinth and junctional zones and invasive trophoblast cells of the uterine-placental interface. Disruption of CITED2 impaired human TS cell abilities to differentiate into EVT cells. CITED2 deficiency in the rat resulted in intrauterine placental and fetal growth restriction, a delay intrauterine trophoblast cell invasion, and postpartum lethality. A CITED1 deficient rat model was established, and phenotypic characterization is in progress. We have established in vitr o and in vivo model systems for interrogating roles for CITED co- regulators in trophoblast cell development and placentation. We conclude that CITED2 and CITED1 contribute to placental development in the rat, but only CITED2 actions on placentation are conserved in the human placenta.

These steroids, however, have been shown to have long-t erm neuroendocrine complications that extend into adult life2. Previously w e showed that prenatal adm inistration of Dexamethasone in mice alters s tem c ell proliferation and neural di fferentiation with anatomical and behavioral outc omes. (Tsiarli) We recently showed in an animal m odel that Ciclesonide is a promising alternative to Dex bec ause Cic has l ess neurological negati ve effec ts m hypothesize that antenatal C iclesonide administration w ill promote lung maturation with less ne gative impact on neural development compared to dexamethasone. Methods and Analyses E14.5 Mouse Embryos w ere injected with 10-7M of either D ex, Cic, or V ehicle . On E17, embryos w ere collecte d and processed for i mmunohistochemical s taining with antibody to identify pr oliferating cells and distinct cell t ypes i n the cerebral -cortex. Further, E14.5 mouse cerebral c ortices' pr imary neural s tem c ell cultures w ere established and stimulated with 10-7M Vehicle, Dex or C iclesonide for 4 hours.

Preliminary IHCs s how the positioning of cerebral c ortex layers are not altered by ei ther s teroid. Results r egarding proof of drug entry i nto fetal l ung need to be quantified. Conclusions Preliminary studies in-vivo suggest that antenatal administration of Cic does not lead to suppression of stem cell proliferation as observed with Dex exposure. These findings suggest that antenatal administration of Cic may be a safer alternative to Dex to reduce neurological alterations. Sources Tsiarli, M. A., Rudine, A., Kendall, N., Pratt, M.

Rishi, Kelsey Timme, Hunter E. White, Aileen F. Keating Department of Animal Science, Iowa State University Histones are slowly evolving major chromatin components and chromatin remodeling can incorporate histone variants which differ in the primary sequences of the canonical histones. Oocytes are arrested in prophase I and while canonical histones are expressed during the S phase of the cell cycle, histone variants are expressed throughout the cell cycle. Incorporation of histone variants represents an epigenetic modification and almost all identified histone variants are involved with environmental stress -induced DNA damage repair (DDR) . Mechanisms of DNA repair are better understood in somatic cells but not in the transcriptionally inactive, prophase-arrested oocyte. Epigenetic regulation, especially, is under -explored ovarian toxicology. Both obesity and dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) are genotoxic stressors and previous work from our group suggests that obesity alters the ovarian response to genotoxicant exposure. Thus, the hypothesis investigated was that obesity potentiates ovotoxicity through ineffective D DR. The objective was to identify histone modifications induced by obesity and DMBA exposure. Wildtype (KK.Cg-a/a; lean) and KK.Cg-Ay/J (obese ) female mice aged ~9 weeks , were exposed to either corn oil (CT) or DMBA (1 mg/kg) for 7d via intraperitoneal injection (n = 10/treatment). Obese mice consumed more food per mouse (P < 0.05) which corresponded to increased body weight at euthanasia ( P < 0.001), corroborating the hyperphagia -induced model of obesity. O ne ovary from each animal was frozen for protein analyses and one was fixed for histological analysis . No treatment effect was observed on ovarian weight ( P > 0.05). Western blot analysis identified no difference in the abundance of H2AX, H3K4me, H4K5ac, H4K12ac and H4K16ac in antral follicle s of obese mice as compared to lean (P < 0.05) and decreased H2AX foci numbers in the corpora lutea of lean CT mice as compared to DMBA -treated lean mice (P < 0.05; n = 5/treatment) were observed, suggesting differing levels of DNA damage in different follicle types. Total ovarian proteome analysis determined that obesity altered a total of 228 proteins (P < 0.05). Histone 3 was the second least abundant protein (FC = -5.98 , P < 0.05). Histone 4 was decreased by 3.33-fold whereas histone variant H3.3 decreased by 3.05-fold were increased by 1.90- 2.01-fold, respectively (P < 0.05). In obese mice, DMBA exposure altered 120 proteins . The abundance of histone 2B was increased by 0.30-fold ( P < 0.05). DMBA treatment altered a total of 48 proteins in lean mice but no alterations in histones or histone variants were observed (P > 0.1). In DMBA -exposed mice, obesity altered the abundance of 636 proteins. T he level of histones 4, 3 and 2A type 1-F were decreased by were increased by 2.72- and 3.07-fold, respectively (P < 0.05). Thus, altered individual histones and the histone variant abundances due to genotoxic stress suggest that obesity alters the transcriptional regulation in ovaries of DMBA -exposed mice.

Rivera 1 1 Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA 2 Theriogenology Department, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Mansoura University, Egypt Early embryonic loss, caused by reduced embryo developmental competence, is the major cause of reduced fertility in humans and animals. This embryo developmental c ompetence is determined during oocyte maturation and the first embryo divisions. Therefore, it is essential to identify the underlying molecules regulating these critical developmental stages to understand how embryo developmental competence is determined. Cathepsin L (CTSL) is a lysosomal cysteine protease that is involved i n regulating cell cycle progression, proliferation and invasion of different cell types. However, CTSL role in mammalian embryo development is unknown. Using bovine in vitro maturation and culture systems, we show that CTSL is an indispensable regulator for embryo developmental competence. We employed a specific CTSL detection assay in live cells to show that CT SL activity correlates with meiotic progression (CTSL was significantly increased in metaphase II vs. prophase I-ar rested oocytes) and early embryo development (increased in morula and blastocyst stages compared to 2-4 c ell embryos). Inhibiting CTSL activity, using a cell permeable inhibitor ( lactoferrin, LF), during oocyte maturation or early embryo development significantly impaired oocy te and embryo developmental competence, following in vitro fertilization, as evidenced by the significant decrease of embryo developmental progression, blastoc yst rates and hatched blastocyst rates. Moreover, increasing CTSL level, using recombinant CTSL (rCTSL), during oocyte maturation or early embryo development significantly improved oocyte and embryo developmental competence. Importantly, rCTSL supplementation during early embryo culture significantly rescued, at least in part, the developmental c ompetence of heat-sh ocked embryos (notoriously known for reduced quality ). Altogether, these results provid e novel evidence that CTSL plays a pivotal role in regulating oocyte and embryo developmental competence, offering a promising approach to improve the efficiency of assisted reproductive technologies. 54 69Granulosa cell specific loss of Adar in mice delays ovulation, oocyte maturation and leads to infertility. Rikki N Nelson, V. Praveen Chakravarthi, Anamika Ratri, Xiaoman Hong, Jan Gossen, Lane K. Christenson University of Kansas Medical Center, Department of Cell Biolog y and Physiology. Adenosine deaminase s acting on RNA-(ADAR) comprise one famil y of RNA editing enzymes that specificall y catal yze adenosine to inosine (A- to-I) editing. A granulosa (GC) Adar depleted mou se model [Adar flox/flox:Cyp19a1-Cre/ + (gcAdarKO)]was used to evaluate the role of ADAR1 during the periovulator y period. Lo ss of Adar in GCs led t o failure to ovulate at 16 h post-hCG, delayed oocyte germinal vesicle coll ected from gcAdarKO and littermate control mice at 0 and 4 h post-hCG following a super-ovulator y dose of eCG (48 h), revealed minimal differences after eCG treatment alone (0 h), consistent with normal folliculogenesi s observed histologicall y and uterine estrogenic responses. In contrast, 300 differential expressed genes (DEGs; >1.5-foldchange and FDRP <0.1) w ere altered at 4 h post-hCG. Ingenuit y pathway analysis identifie d many downstream target s of estrogen and progesterone pathways, whil e multiple gene s involved in inflammatory respon ses were upregulated i n the gcAdarKO GCs. Temporal expression analysis of GCs at 0, 4, 8, and 12 h post-hCGof Ifi44, Ifit1, Ifit3b, and Oas1g and Ovgp1 confirmed upregulation these inflammatory and interferon gene s and downregulation ofOvgp1 a glycoprotein involved in oocyt e zona pellucida stability. Thus, loss of ADAR in GCs lea ds to increased expression of inflammator y and interferon response genes which are temporally linked to ovulation failure, alterations in oocyte developmental progression and infertility. 55 70Effects of Betamethasone and Dexamethasone Administration to Preterm Infants on Metabolic Disease Cardiac Keya first author 1University Missouri Kansas City School of Medicine Endogenous glucocorticoids (GCs) are essential for the maturation of fetal organs and tissues . During late gestation, both maternal and fetal GC concentrations rise, promoting development of the fetal heart and lung. Preterm births occur before 37 weeks of gestation, before the fetus is able to achieve sufficient GC concentrations for proper organ maturation. Inadequate lung maturation may predispose a fetus to respiratory distress syndrome and, later, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a chronic lung disease caused by airway irritation and inflammation. In the United States, betamethasone is administered prenatally, or dexamethasone is administered postnatally in preterm infants to promote lung maturation. While there is sufficient evidence to prove that exogenous GCs decrease the risk for respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants, their effects on the heart are currently being studied. Exogenous GC administration may be linked to metabolic syndrome during adult life. Metabolic syndrome is defined as meeting three or more of the following: increased blood pressure, glucose intolerance, reduced HDL, elevated triglycerides, and increased waist circumference. Postnatal dexamethasone administration is also thought to induce cardiac hypertrophy, leading to arrythmias during adult life. This purpose of this study is to compare the effects of betamethasone and dexamethasone administration in preterm infants to monitor the development of metabolic syndrome and cardiac abnormalities using mouse models. To demonstrate the effects of GCs on the development of metabolic syndrome, we compared heart weight to body weight ratios of adult mice that were injected with 10 -7M betamethasone or dexamethasone on embryonic day 14. Metabolic profiling was also performed to measure serum glucose and lipid concentrations. Cardiac abnormalities were measured through electrocardiogram s, which indicated that dexamethasone alone leads to long term changes in QTc intervals. Anatomical measurements of left and right ventricles at birth and in adults indicate that abnormalities in heart organization are present from birth. Quantitative Polymerase chain reaction analyses of cardiac markers were also performed to identify changes in expression of alpha- and beta-myosin heavy chain, both markers of cardiac hypertrophy . Our studies lead to the hypothesis that prenatal synthetic GC exposure leads to reprogramming of heart development that is formulation specific. 56 71MIG-6 is critical for progesterone responsiveness in human complex atypical hyperplasia and early -stage endometrial cancer. of Obste strics, Gynecology and Women's Health, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, 2Public Health Sciences Program, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ahn Arbor, MI, 3Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC, 4Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist, Winston -Salem, NC, 5Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology & Reproductive Biology, Michigan State University, College of Human Medicine, Grand Rapids, MI . Women with complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH) or early -stage endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC) are candidates for fertility preservation. The most common approach is progesterone (P4) therapy and deferral of hysterec tomy until after completion of childbearing. However, P4 therapy response rates vary, and the molecular mechanisms behind P4 resistance are poorly understood. One potential molecular cause of P4 resistance is a loss or attenuation of PGR expression. Mitoge n-inducible gene 6 ( MIG-6) is critical for P4 responsiveness. In order to understand the relationship between MIG -6 and PGR in P4 resistance, MIG-6 protein expression in the endometrial epithelial and stromal cells from women with CAH and EEC was significantly lower compared to women without CAH or EEC (controls) (p<0.001). The P4 -responsive women (10/15) exhibited an increase of MIG -6 expressio n in epithelial and stromal cells compared to P4 -resistant women (5/15) (p<0.05). In immunohistochemical analysis for PGR results showed that stromal PGR levels are significantly higher in P4 -responsive women compared to P4 -resistant women (p<0.0 5), whereas epithelial PGR expression was not different. A reverse correlation of MIG-6 and pAKT levels was observed in early -stage EEC patients. Studies strongly suggest that loss of MIG -6 and PGR, and activation of pAKT lead to P4 resistance in CAH and E EC. These results will help to elucidate the molecular mechanism leading to P4 resistance in CAH and EEC.

Sarah King , Florence Osei, Sharon Fitzgerald, Dr. Courtney Marsh Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, The University of Kansas School of Medicine Background : The endometrial microbiome has shown to produce bioactive molecules that interact with cells to regulate and influence metabolism, physiology, and immune function. Recent studies have found that the endometrial microbiota influences implantation success or failure. Non-L actobacillus dominated microbiota significantly decrease successful implantation and live birth rates. Additionally, it is known that specific pathogens colonizing the endometrium cause chronic endometritis, an inflammatory condition impacting up to 40% of infertile women. Understanding the factors that affect endometrial microbiome composition and analyzing the relationship between the microbiome and endometrial lining thickness could help us understand its impact on reproductive function. Objective : This study sought to identify the factors that affect endometrial microbiota , assess its effect on endometrial thickness, and analyze the impact of the endometrial microbial community on reproductive outcome in infertile patients undergoing in vitro fertil ization. Study Design : To identify the factors that affect the endometrial microbiota, we used data from the Igenomix EMMA/ALICE biopsy sequencing of 132 patients undergoing in vitro fertilization. We gathered information from patient charts to compare possible factors that affect the endometrial microbiota and pregnancy outcomes including BMI, age, and number of transfer cycles. To analyze the impact of the endometrial microbiome on endometrial thickness, we used data from the Igenomix EMMA/ALICE biopsy sequencing of 64 patients with thickness measured 5 days prior to biopsy to determine whether having an abnormal or pathogenic endometrial microbiome was associated with endometrial lining thickness measurements of <8 mm. Finally, the reproductive impact of an altered endometrial microbiota was assessed by unsuccessful pregnancy and live birth rates in 160 infertile patients undergoing in vitro fertilization. Results: The preliminary results from the EMMA/ALICE study showed that there is a correlation between obesity and the endometrial mic r obiota. Patients who underwent ALICE testing were split into 2 groups, pathogenic or nonpathogenic, depending on presence or absence of endometritis- causing pathogens. There was statistically significant correlation between obesity and pathogenic ALICE results [45.45% vs 34.34% (p=0.0319)]. Patients who underwent EMMA testing were split into 2 groups, Lactobacillus dominant (>90% Lactobacillus spp.) vs non- lactobacillus dominant (<90% Lactobacillus species with or without presence of pathogenic species). There was not a statistically significant correlation between BMI and non- Lactobacillus dominant endometrial microbiota. Interestingly, there was an association between a normal, Lactobacillus-dominant endometrial microbiota and obesity, although this was not significant [ 41.94% vs 29.55% (p= 0.2524)]. This could be attributed to increased aromatase activity and increased estrogen levels in obese individuals leading to increased growth and proliferation of Lactobacillus spp. Conclusion: We concluded that critical f acilitators such as obesity can lead to chronic endometritis and affect implantation. These interactions could be regulated by the levels of estrogen and progesterone and the effects that they have on the endometrium. Obesity plays an important role in endometrial proliferation and could impact the endometrial microbiome. 58 73Patient-s pecific Trophoblast Stem Cell Lines Derived Chorionic Villus 1Institute for R eproducti ve and Developmental Sciences, Department of Pathology & L aboratory M edicine, University of K ansas M edical C enter, Kansas C ity, KS 66160, 2Divisi on of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Cedars -Sinai M edical Center, Los A ngeles , Children's M ercy R Institute, Children's Mercy, Kansas C ity, MO 64108, 5Department of Anatomy and Cell B iology, U niversity o f Kansas M edical Center, Kansas C ity, KS 66160, 6Department of Informative Genetics, Environment and Genome Research Center, Tohoku University G raduate School of Medicine, Sendai 980-8 575, J apan, 7Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Cedars -Sinai M edical C enter, Los A ngeles, CA , 8David Geffen School of Medicine and 9Department of Biomedical S ciences, C edars -Sinai M edical C enter, Los A ngeles, CA , 10Department of Obstetrics a nd Gynecology, University of Kansas M edical C enter, Kansas C ity, KS 66160 Early ev ents of human pregnancy, including trophoblast cell l ineage development, are critical for p regnancy success b ut challenging to study.

Green* *Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri; Columbia, MO **Department of Animal Science, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX Pregnancy -associated glycopr oteins (PAGs) are a complex gene family, whose members are expressed by trophoblasts of even-toed ungulates and other species in the Cetartiodactyla order. In cattle, the PAGs accumulate at the trophoblast-uterine interface, and many can enter the maternal circulation. However, very little is known about their exact function in pregnancy, although preliminary results suggest that PAGs at the placenta-uterine interface play roles involving matrix turnover and immune modulation. This study was designed to provide further insight into the biological roles of bovine PAGs by measuring changes in endometrial transcri pt abundance globally. PAGs for these experiments were purified from mid -gestation bovine placental extracts by affinity chromatography. Heifers were synchronized and bred by artificial insemination. Heifers were slaughtered at day 18 post-insemination and the reproductive tracts were obtained and flushed to determine if a conceptus was present. Endometrial explants were collected and split between 4 groups: pregnant with and without 15 \u00b5g/ml PAG (n=10) and PAG (n=9). Endometrial explants were cultured for up to 96 hours at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 and samples were harvested at 24 h intervals for RNA extraction. Transcript abundance and differentially expressed genes (DEG) were determined using RNA - Seq. Some selected target genes w ere analyzed in the endometrial tissue by quantitative PCR, with PPIA being used as the normalization control transcript. Top differentially expressed pathways include IL-17 signaling, TNF , and Significant increases in 1, and CXCL5 as well as MMP1, MMP3 and MMP13 were measured in the PAG-treated endometrium from pregnant and non-pregnant animals (P<0.05) using qPCR. There were also significant decreases in message for CCL2, CCL8, CCL16, CXCL10 and CXCL12 in the PAG from pregnant and non-pregnant animals (P<0.05). Quantitative PCR analysis supports data found by RNA -Seq. Immuno-histochemical analysis of tissues supports data found during quantitative PCR analysis. These results suggest that PAGs are capable of inducing changes in transcript abundance in bovine endometrial explants, which suggests that this model system might be useful to assess PAG function at the placenta-uterine interface.

Ten to twenty percent of pregnancies end in miscarriage with e ighty percent of pregnancy loss occur ring during the first trimester . Because w e lack a complete understanding of the environment within the oviduct (Fallopian tube in humans) and its role in regulating early pregnancy, it is difficult to provide diagnostic tools for oviductal origin of early pregnancy loss. Progesterone (P 4), the pregnancy hormone, is required during the first day of pregnancy for normal embryo development and transport to the uterus. Increased cytokine levels during pregnancy have been associated with recurrent miscarriage . The treatment of dydrogesterone (synthet ic progesterone ) has been suggested to suppress cytokine levels during pregnancy , indicating the importance of P 4 action for successful pregnancy . Previous studies have shown that ablation of progesterone receptor (Pgr) in the epitheli um of the female repr oductive tract (epithelial Pgrd/d) causes infertil ity, partly due to a uterine implantation defect in mice . Here, we found that epithelial PGR expression in the oviduct was also required for normal embryo development in the oviduct as ~50% of embryos at 3.5 days post -coitus (dpc) are nonviable or developmentally delayed . Additionally, ~6 0% of embryos were retained in epithelial Pgrd/d oviduct s suggesting that epithelial PGR is crucial for normal embryo development and transport. Furthermore, the majority of the embryos that were retained in the oviduct were underdeveloped or nonviable. Single cell RNA -sequencing analysis of oviductal tissues from epithelial Pgrd/d females show ed an upregulation of inflammatory respons ive genes (i.e., Il22, Stat3 and Tlr4) in epithelial cell populations compared to control oviducts at 0.5 dpc. Using PGR -ChIP Seq analysis, w e identified PGR binding sites at -4kb from the transcriptional state site (TSS) of Il22ra and and at the TSS of Stat3 , and Tlr4. Therefore, it is likely that expression of inflammatory responsive gene s is PGR -mediated and that PGR regulates immune function in the oviduct during early pregnancy. Lastly, we observed an upregulation of genes in the protease family (such as Prss23 downregulation Pgrd/d oviducts. These alterations due to a loss of oviductal epithelial PGR may lead to an environment not suitable for preimplantation embryo development . These findings shed light on the roles of classical P 4 signaling through epithelial PGR i n the oviduct and offer potential applications for women's reproductive health and diagnostic tools of early pregnancy loss. 61 76Syncytiotrophoblast (STB) subtypes are revealed by single nucleus RNA sequence (snRNAseq) analysis of trophoblast derived from primed-t ype human pluripotent cells Teka Khan1, 2, Arun S.

We have been studying STB generated from human pluripotent stem cells treated with BMP4 in the presence of A83 -01 and PD173074, inhibitors for ACTIVIN/TGFB and FGF2 signaling, respectively (BAP exposure). Within 48 hours of BAP treatment, the cells are almost entirely KRT7 -positive, indicating an efficient conversion to trophoblast, and by days 5 -7 STB emerges, which we hypothesize resembles the syncytium that encases the early human conceptus as it implants. We have employed single nucleus RNAseq (snRNAseq) analysis on BAP -exposed H1 human (hESCs) to study the heterogeneity of trophoblast cell types that emerge during the first 8 days of differentiation. Our hypothesis is that the STB would have a gene signature analogous to that of STB from villous placenta during the first trimester of pregnancy. Single nucleus RNAseq is particularly powerful in this regard, because the fragility and size of STB precludes single cell RNAseq from being employed. On days 7 and 8, BAP-e xposed cells were producing large quantities of hCG as measured by ELISA, confirming the presence of STB. Nuclei were isolated after dissociating the colonies and employing the 10X Genomics protocol from which cDNA libraries were constructed. RNAseq provided data from a total of 5,355 nuclei, which, after subtracting sequences representing ribosomal genes and contaminating mitochondria, provided between 200 and 7,500 unique sequences per nucleus. Seurat analysis revealed a high degree of heterogeneity among the nu clei, representing different trophoblast cell types. Specifically, at least eight distinct clusters of nuclei were evident, of which four were likely different kinds of mononucleated cytotrophoblasts (CTB) (clusters 1,4,7,8), two clusters (2, 3) weakly res embled extravillous trophoblast (EVT-lik e), and two clusters (5, 6) were strongly enriched with distinctive STB transcripts also found in villous STB. There was no evidence that other extra -embryonic lineages, including amnion, were identified among any of the eight clusters. Further analysis determined that, of the distinctive STB transcripts, 18 were common to clusters 5 and 6, whereas 57 were enriched in cluster 5, and 55 were enriched in cluster 6. Surprisingly, immunocytochemistry (ICC) results with cl uster -specific markers including nuclear and cytoplasmic markers, revealed the presence of four distinct STB subtypes in the colonies of BAP -exposed ESCs. Our data demonstrate that subtypes of STB, distinct from but carrying many of the transcriptional hal lmarks of first trimester villous STB, emerge when ESCs are exposed to the BAP differentiation regimen. Since our snRNAseq data analysis identified two STB clusters, whereas ICC showed four STB subtypes, it would be interesting to investigate whether the I CCidentified STB subtypes represent different developmental stages of the two clusters determined by snRNAseq, or whether they are truly distinct subtype 62 77Transcriptional program established by GATA2 and GATA3 ensure s lineage commitment and differentiation of trophoblast stem cells to Syncytiotrophoblasts Authors: Ananya Ghosh, Rajnish Kum ar, Ram Kumar and Soumen Paul. Institution: Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Institute for Reproduction and Perinatal Research (IRPR) , University of Kansas Medical Center, USA The placenta establishes a maternal -fetal exchange interface which ensures transportation of nutrients and gases between the mother and the fetus. A critically conserved step in the establishment of this exchange surface in mammals is the fusion of trophoblast cells into a multinucleated syncytiotrophoblasts (SynT). In mice, SynTs develop via differentiation of the labyrinth trophoblast progenitors (LaTP) of the developing placenta, and in humans, SynTs develop via differentiation of villous cytotrophoblast (CTB) progenitors. Despite being an indispensable step for mammalian development in utero, conserved molecular mechanisms that ensure SynT development are poorly understood. Our lab discovered that global deletion of Gata2 and Gata3 genes in mouse trophoblast cells severely impairs placentation leading to embryonic death at embryonic day 8.0 (E8.0), a stage similar to first-trimester human pregnancy, accompanied by a reduction in the labyrinth layer that is composed mainly of SynT cells. GATA2 and GATA3 also show conserved expression in the human trophoblast cells, in the cytotrophoblast layer as well as the SynT layer. We, therefore, hypothesize that a conserved transcriptional program regulated by GATA2 and GATA3 are essential for differentiation of human trophoblast progenitors towards SynT lineage at maternal -fetal interface. Herein, we show that G ATA2 and GATA3 (GATA factors) plays an essential role in labyrinth trophoblast progenitors (LaTPs) thereby committing these cells towards the SynT differentiation program. Loss of GATA factors in the LaTPs (GATA DKO) abrogate mature SynT development, resulting in a small, underdeveloped placenta which lead to embryonic death at approximately embryonic day 9.5 (E9.0). Despite the smaller size of the GATA DKO placenta, single cell RNA Seq (scRNA -Seq) analysis of GATA DKO placentae. tors were SynT but contributed to sinusoidal TGC (S- TGC) lineage, indicating that in mouse trophoblasts the commitment to the SynT lineage and their differentiation to mature SynT is determined by both GATA2 and GATA3. We also show that GATA factor -mediated priming of trophoblast progenitors for SynT differentiation is a conserved event during human placentation. Unlike mouse trophoblast cells, loss of either GATA2 or GATA3 in CTB -derived human trophoblast stem cells (human TSCs) did not impair their self-renewal but their loss drastically impaired their SynT differentiatio n potential in vitro in 2D as well as 3D culture conditions. Our mechanistic analyses indicate that both GATA2 and GATA3 target multiple SynT ERVW-1, GCM1, SDC1 and HGF which are key transcription factors that instigate SynT differentiation programs in trophoblast progenitors. Our study uncovers a conserved molecular mechanism, in which GATA2 and GATA3 mediated transcriptional program establishment of the maternal -fetal exchange surface by promoting trophoblast progenitor -to-SynT commitment and differentiation during placentation. 63 78Estrogen Receptor Signaling Mediates Uterine Epithelial Organoid Development Jason A. Rizo, Andrew M. Kelleher, and Thomas E. Spencer. Division of Animal S ciences and Division of Obstetrics , Gynecology and Women's H ealth, University of M issouri. All mammalian uteri contain glands in their endometrium that develop primarily after birth. Gland development or adenogenesis is intrinsically regulated by proliferation, cell -cell interactions, growth factors and their inhibitors, as well as transcription factors, including forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) and estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1). While several studies have established a critical role for FOXA2 in gland development, the role of ESR1 remains unclear. Uterine epithelial proliferation and initial gland development were unaltered in Esr1 null mice prior to puberty; however, luminal epithelial proliferation and the number of glands were reduced in adult ESR1 null mice. Furthermore, neonatal administration of ICI 182,780, a potent ESR1 antagonist, or exogenous estrogen, resulted in aberrant uterine gland development and function. To test the hypothesis that ESR1-s ignaling regulates glandular epithelial maintenance and proliferation, a series of studies were conducted using a combination of mouse genetic models and uterine epithelial organoid culture. First, endometrial epithelial cells were isolated from post-n atal Day 13 ESR1 null or wildtype (WT) females 25 hydrogel, cultured conditions of ESR1 in organoids was confirmed by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis. ESR1 was detectable only in WT organoids, whereas progesterone receptor and the endometrial gland marker, present in ESR1 null organoids. Endometrial epithelial organoids (EEO) could be established and expanded from both WT and ESR1 null mice; however, differences in morphology and EEO growth were evident. Growth characteristics of ESR1 null EEO were determined with a 20-d ay organoid formation assay. A total of 3000 single cells (passage 3) were plated in 20 \u00b5L drops of Cultrex hydrogel (n=6 per animal), and formation was evaluated every 96 h. There was no difference in EEO formation efficiency (P=0.21), but ESR1 null EEO were 2.2-fold larger (P<0.05) than WT organoids after 20 of growth. Interestingly, w ildtype EEO formed single-l ayered spheres, whereas ESR1 null multilayered WT EEO. Pathway and string enrichment analysis identified keratinization as the top upregulated pathway with increased basal keratins required for cornified envelop differentiation. Indeed, immunofluorescence detected the presence of basal epithelial cell markers P63 and KRT5 in ESR1 in WT EEO . These data provide evidence that the absence of ESR1 impacts uterine epithelial organoid deve lopment and differentiation. Future studies will focus on understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms of ESR1 signaling and regulation of uterine epithelial development and function.

Haffner, Kelsey Timme, Hunter E. White, Aileen F. Keating Departm ent of Animal S cience, Iowa S tate University Reduced female fertility can be caused by lifestyle and environmental factors. Obesity , which is associated with reduced oocyte quality, conception, and implantation, affects over 40% of US reproductively aged women. Environmental toxicant exposure can damage DNA and cause infertility. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon , 7,12-d imethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) , is generated during combustion of organic material present in tobacco products, smoked meats, and diesel exhaust fumes. Prop er hepatic chemical biotransformation function is necessary to prevent toxicants from impacting the ovary. Previous findings support that obese mice suffer increased DNA damage and a reduced ovarian protective response compared to lean counterparts during ovotoxicant exposure. Whether those differences in obese compared to lean mice result from compromised hepatic function remains unclear. This study investigated the hypothesis that DMBA exposure may alter hepatic mRNA abundance of genes associated with fatty liver in obese female mice. At six weeks of age, female C57BL6J mice (n = 40) were randomly assigned a chow (n = 20) or high fat, high sucrose (HFHS ; 45% kCal from fat and 20% sucrose; n = 20) diet ad libitum . When the HFHS group had ~30% increased body mass compared to lean mice, mice received an intraperitoneal injection with corn oil (vehicle control ; CT) or DMBA (1 mg/kg) for 7 d. Thus, there were four treatment groups: lean-C T, lean-D MBA, HFHS-C T, and HFHS- DMBA (n =10 each). Euthanasia occurred at day two of diestrus , upon which body, ovary, uterus, spleen, and liver weights were recorded. Increased body weight was observed (P < 0.05) in HFHS mice , but there was no DMBA effect. Liver weight was increased (P < 0.05) in HFHS-D MBA (0.96g \u00b1 0.04) relative to lean-DMBA (0.80g \u00b1 0.04) mice but no additional treatment differences occurred. Hepatic RNA was isolated and converted to complimentary DNA for qRT-PCR analysis using a Qiagen fatty liver PCR HFHS mice had ( 2.2- fold; P < 0.05) abundance of Gck and decreased ( P < 0.05) Atp5c1 In lean DMBA exposure decreased ( P < 0.05) Cyp2e1 mRNA abundance by 2.9-fold. In HFHS mice, DMBA exposure increased ( P < 0.05) Fabp5 by 2.3-fold and decreased ( P < 0.05) Foxa2 by 2.4-f old. Comparison between lean-DMBA and HFHS -DMBA mice identified increased ( P < 0.05) mRNA encoding B2m (1.9-fold) and Tnf (4.7-fold) and Serpine1 (6 .0-fold). These findings support the hypothesis that the liver of an obese female has an altered hepatic response to toxicant exposure compared to a lean female, potentially affecting female reproductive and general health.

Cupp4, John S. Davis1,3 1Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Nebraska Medical Center; 2Department of Cellular and Integrative Physiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA. 4Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA. 4Department of Animal Science, University of Nebraska- Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA. The ovarian corpus luteum is a transient endocrine gland derived from the remnants of the ovulated follicle. The main function of the corpus luteum is to produce progesterone, a steroid hormone that is crucial for the implantation stage of pregnancy and therefore essential for fertility. The functional corpus luteum has a heterogenous cell population, consisting of steroidogenic cells, endothelial cells, resident immune cells, and fibroblasts. When there is no conceptus, the corpus luteum undergoes rapid structural remodeling, regressing into a fibrotic mass . The dynamics of fibrosis in the regressing corpus luteum remain unknown. Our laboratory , as well as others , have demonstrated that when luteal regression is induced with prostaglandin F2 (PGF, the main luteolytic signal) transcription of basic fibroblast growth factor ( FGF2) is increased 7-fold (n = 4/ group, p < 0.01 ) in bovine luteal tissue within 4 hours . Fibroblast activating protein also increases 4- fold 12 h post-PGF (p < 0.05, n = 4/ group) , indicating that fibroblast activation may occur during PGF-induced luteal regression. Previous reports indicate that FGF2/bFGF is pro- angiogenic and required for proper vascularization and function of the corpus luteum . bFGF is also mitogenic and increases type 1 collagen production in fibroblasts from other tissues, but this effect has yet to be studied in the corpus luteum. W e hypothesized that bFGF is pro-mitogenic and increases pro-fibrotic function of luteal fibroblasts. To test our hypothesis, luteal fibroblasts were treated with bFGF at various concentrations (0-10 ng/ml) for 24- and 48 h to determine its effect on proliferation and collagen production. Proliferation was measured by trypan blue exclusion, EdU incorporation, and western blot analysis for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Collagen content and downstream signaling (ERK, AKT, STAT1, p70S6K phosphorylation) were also measured by western blot analysis. To determine downstream signaling pathways, luteal fibroblasts were also treated with bFGF (1 ng/mL) for 2-120 min. .. Each experiment was repeated with luteal fibroblasts from 3 different cows, and differences between means were determined using an unpaired Student's t-test compared to control values . Phosphorylation of STAT1 increased 10-fold (p < 0.05) and ERK increased 3.2-fold after 10 minutes of bFGF treatment (p < 0.05), AKT and its downstream components GSK3B 1.5-fold (p < 0.05), and p70S6K 3 -fold (p < 0.0001) . At 48 hours of bFGF treatment, type 1 collagen increased 1.6-fold at 3 ng/mL and 2.1-fold at 10 ng/mL in serum-free medium (p < 0.05). Although fibroblast cell number did not change after 24 h of bFGF treatment, PCNA content increased in a dose- dependent manner. After 48 h of bFGF, cell number doubled ( p < 0.05) .and similar results were obtained with an EdU incorporation assay (1.6-fold increase, p < 0.05, n = 3) . The cell proliferation marker PCNA increased 1.6-fold at 0.3 ng/mL (p < 0.01) and at 1.5-fold at 1 ng/mL. bFGF (p < 0.05). Additionally, inhibition of ERK activation with U0126 and p70S6K with Rapamycin had no effect on fibroblast PCNA content after 48 h. However, inhibition of STAT1 activation with Fludarabine and AKT with an AKT kinase inhibitor sharply reduced PCNA content after 48 h. From these results, we conclude that bFGF increas es luteal fibroblast proliferation and production of type 1 collagen content, suggesting that luteal fibroblasts may contribute to the fibrotic nature of the regressing corpus luteum. 66 81Investigating the effects of ACTC1 on cell fusion during early placental development Juliann Leak1,6, Ezashi2, and Laura C. Schulz3 1-Univers ity of Missouri, Division of Biological Sciences; 2- University of Missouri, Division of Animal Sciences; 3 - University of Missouri, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Women's Health; 4-University o f Missouri- Department of Biochemistry; 5- Washington University in St. Louis - Department of Developmental Biology ; 6- Kansas University Medical Center- School o f Medicine Placental samples from early stages in human pregnancy are challenging to obtain; therefore, our laboratory utilizes a pluripotent human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived model to study early placental trophoblast. These hESCs can be differentiated to trophoblast by BAP treatment, which consists of BMP4, A83-01 of and FGF2). Previous RNA sequencing and immunostaining performed by our lab show the gene ACTC1 is upregulated during this differentiation process. ACTC1 encodes an alpha cardiac actin abundantly localized in cardiac and skeletal muscle, but the role of ACTC1 in placental trophoblast is unknown. The goal of the present study is to characterize hESC lines that lack (KO) or have less (KD) ACTC1 following CRISPR/Cas9 knockdown to determine whether it is necessary for trophoblast differentiation. Western blot analysis indicates a complete absence of ACTC1 protein in two clones of the KO cell lines. Crystal violet staining shows cell colony diameter on day 6 of BAP treatment was significantly smaller in KO lines A2 and A7 vs H1 control trophoblast, while K D line 1-2 was significantly larger and KD line 1-6 was not significantly different than controls. Additionally, immunofluorescenc e at day 6 of BAP treatment shows areas of syncytiotrophoblast were significantly smaller in the KO lines compared to those in H1 control trophoblast, with intermediate sizes in the KD lines. The number of syncytia formed were similar between cell lines, but the number of nuclei per syncytia was significantly less in KO compared to H1 control trophoblast. By ELISA, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) secretion was significantly reduced in KD and KOs relative to H1 control trophoblast. In summary, our data suggest the lack of ACTC1 results in a phenotype of reduced syncytial size and impairment in function. 67 82Registrant List Last Name First Name Credentials E-mail Institution / University Abouelezz Mohammed PhD mafb3@missouri.edu University of Missouri, Columbia Adnan Mahfuz MS; DVM madnan@kumc.edu University of Kansas Medical Center Ali nna92t@umsystem.edu University of Missouri Aljubran Fatimah PhD faljubran@stowers.org Stowers Institute for Medical Research Antwi-Boasiako Collins MS collins5@iastate.edu Iowa State University Baker Julie C.
