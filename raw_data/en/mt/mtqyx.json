The [Spa Factory recall](http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml09/09112.html) applies to fantasy fountains and kits sold between August 2008 and January 2009 at Sam's Clubs, Wal-Marts, Targets and other toy stores throughout the United States. The products are marketed as a spa treatment for young girls, containing small jars with purple caps that are used to make Bath Bombs/Balls and Bath Fizzies. Did You Know? Millions of Philips CPAP Machines Recalled Philips DreamStation, CPAP and BiPAP machines sold in recent years may pose a risk of cancer, lung damage and other injuries. [Learn More](https://www.aboutlawsuits.com/philips-cpap-machines/) Pressure from the buildup of carbon dioxide in the jars can cause the purple cap to blow off, potentially causing injury to the face. Citric acid contained in the jars may also get into the eyes, causing potential eye irritation. At least 88 reports have been received by the manufacturer of Spa Factory jars exploding, including 19 reports of injury. At least 13 of the reports of injury involve young children between 6 and 11 years old, who suffered welts, cuts, eye irritation and eye injuries from flying caps. The products recalled include the following models with an item number located on the bottom of the product packaging: - Spa Factory Bath Benefits Kit 37836 - Spa Factory Deluxe Spa Fantasy Aromatherapy Fountain 37908 - Spa Factory Spa Fantasy Aromatherapy Fountain 37837 - Spa Factory Spa Fantasy Aromatherapy Fountain 54892 - Spa Factory Spa Fantasy Aromatherapy Fountain 54857 In a notice posted on their the [myspafactory.com website](http://www.myspafactory.com/construction.htm), JAKKS Pacific indicates that they have found that placing two small holes in the caps allows built up pressure to escape, eliminating the risk that the cap may explode off the jar. All Spa Factory Fantasy Aromatherapy Fountains and Bath Benefits kits sold after November 2008 contain caps with the two vent holes, and for those who have the original caps, free replacements are being provided free of charge by sending an email to caps@jakks.net. - AnaNovember 26, 2011 at 5:48 pm Wow...... i wanted this a few years ago for christmas but my mom decided to buy me a bracelet instead THANK GOD!!!!! now i started searching for it again and found this out i was really lucky i cant even imagine what would happen if my mom did buy it. - BrittanyJuly 23, 2010 at 2:30 pm I bought this set in like December 09 with the numbers Listed that were recalled and just saw the recall today and checked my daughters and it has no holes! Please explain to me why the sets that have. He issues were still being sold over a year later? This makes no sense to me! - ChristieJanuary 1, 2010 at 7:27 pm What they fail to tell you is that not all of the item numbers were recalled, therefore they are still being sold. Both my daughter and niece received one for Christmas and last night, my niece's exploded on her. It was on the walls, all over her face, her eyes and now her hands feel numb all the time. I checked my daughters box and her item number is not listed but does not have holes in the lids[Show More]What they fail to tell you is that not all of the item numbers were recalled, therefore they are still being sold. Both my daughter and niece received one for Christmas and last night, my niece's exploded on her. It was on the walls, all over her face, her eyes and now her hands feel numb all the time. I checked my daughters box and her item number is not listed but does not have holes in the lids. It says to use by August 2010, which leads to me believe it was probably manufactured around August 2008. I think this product should have been recalled according to the product itself and not item numbers. The CPSC site lists 4 different item numbers for the same product. I think they only recalled those numbers that had complaints related to them but common sense would tell you that since the lids were the issue, they all need to replaced. What sense does it make to continue to sell the same product with the same faults just because no one happened to have issues with it yet? This sounds like the company was trying to avoid loss of profit by removing those boxes from the shelf and placed additional children at risk. This sounds like willful noncompliance to me. - lexiJanuary 1, 2010 at 3:16 am i just bought one of those spa fantasy aromatherapy fountain yesterday,and today my aunt came over so i asked her if she wanted me to make a bath fizz balls and she said,''ya go ahead'', so i did when i was done i took it to her and i went to pick up a game that i played earlier and the were in the kitchen and all of a sudden we heared a big boomb,and what happend was the fizz ball exploed all ov[Show More]i just bought one of those spa fantasy aromatherapy fountain yesterday,and today my aunt came over so i asked her if she wanted me to make a bath fizz balls and she said,''ya go ahead'', so i did when i was done i took it to her and i went to pick up a game that i played earlier and the were in the kitchen and all of a sudden we heared a big boomb,and what happend was the fizz ball exploed all ove the walls,celling,floor and my aunt, who is pregnant and could of gotten hert real baddly and we think she is so i just told them '' i will never let anyone in my family or just people i know,or friends and thier family's buy and product from your company ever again.

So all you can say is let us know and you will replace the caps. How did this ever get onto shelves to sell to children to begin with if this could happen. I do not believe replacement caps with holes in them is going to satisfy parents of children that this has happened to. - sandraFebruary 10, 2009 at 2:17 am if you put holes in the lids, then the stuff will leak out. how is this gonna make anyone happy... \"*\" indicates required fields More Top Stories [ Talcum Powder Cancer Lawsuits Moving Forward Against J&J After Lengthy Litigation Stay (Posted today) ](https://www.aboutlawsuits.com/talcum-powder-lawsuits-moving-forward/) A federal judge is moving talcum powder cancer lawsuits forward again, asking plaintiffs to submit medical records, and in some cases, notification of death, for pending claims.
