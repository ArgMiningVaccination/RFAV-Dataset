To achieve these purposes, especially the latter one, Ayurveda does not shy away from using any and all means. Chemical constituents Marijuana - , amino acids c-glycosy - favamaids. There is no substance in the universe that cannot be used as medicine. Any substance can be used as medicine if the doctor uses yukti. Yukti - how to make a planned combination of the medicine and Artha - what actually is the purpose of the substance. For this reason only, we see a lot of non veg substances, narcotic and poisonous substances used in Ayurveda as medicine. Hence, from a strict medical point of view, Ayurveda recommends using Marijuana in specific doses to treat specific conditions, for specific amounts of time periods. From a spiritual point of view, Spirituality is an inward journey. For which, I guess we should not depend on external stimuli in the form of Marijuana, LSD etc. Use in multiple sclerosis There is some minor evidence that Marijuana is useful in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Its extract - delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol - is available as an oral spray medicine called . This is used in treating spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis. This medicine is available in 15 countries. Ethical concerns Ethical concerns related to Bhang usage: Marijuana is used in some Indian festivals, but it is illegal here in India, to use, possess or sell it. Many people get caught doing these things every day. It is being legalized in many states in the USA. Medically, Marijuana is being proved to be very useful in the treatments of multiple sclerosis, parkinson's diseases etc. In Ayurveda also, there are many medicines with it, as an ingredient, like Madanakameshwari lehya, used as aphrodisiac, Sarpagandha vati, used for treating insomnia etc. It is very true that medical use of Marijuana is very beneficial. But just because Marijuana is being made legal, it should not be understood that everyone can use it without any side effects. Alcohol and smoking are also legal. But they have repercussions on our health. When it comes to ethical reasoning, it is best to ask ourselves - Will we give Marijuana to our children? No, if they want to use it for recreational purposes, Yes, for a short period of time, if they have a disease in which Marijuana can be very useful to treat better than any other medicine. In some parts of India, spiritual masters take Marijuana to feel high and feel happy. It is still unethical to do it. Spiritual bliss should come from within and not from an external source. Anyone can smoke it and feel high but that temporary happiness and elation is coming from an external source, not from the inner source of eternal energy, what we call as God.
